Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and other members of the Education and 
and Cultural Affairs  Committee, my name is Janice Driver and I live in West Bath. 
I really enjoyed teaching. I taught for 31 years and retired in 2011. I worked hard as a 
teacher. On most Saturdays I would go to school until about 1 pm and then bring the 
rest of the work home.  When earning my masters I would do  my coursework on 
Sundays.   I have a vivid memory of working on the computer. As I was working I 
would catch movement outside the window.  My husband, my son and my daughter 
were out there playing. During the years I worked on my masters I devoted both 
weekend days to education.  That isnâ€™t the only time teaching came before my family.
I gave my all to my job and worked hard.  
While teaching I was told I would have a COLA every year that would keep pace 
with inflation.  That changed the year I retired. The first three years we received  zero 
percent. After that the COLA for retired teachers was based on an arbitrary amount. 
For example, this past year teachers received a 3% COLA  BUT it was computed on  
$24,186.  Because that base was used my COLA was 1.9%. This is the first time I 
have felt scared about my financial future.   A 1.9% is not enough to keep up with 
inflation or to make up any of the ground that retired teachers have lost. Even though 
this bill is not about the COLA, if passed it will help with our retirement.
 Please pass LD 1773 and give some relief to retired teachers.
 I will be happy to answer any questions.
 Janice Driver
