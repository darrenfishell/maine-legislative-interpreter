Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed 
members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee 
My name is Bob Jean from Rockland. I am a retired teacher with 38 
years of sen/ice in Maine’s Public Schools and I am also the new 
President of Maine Education Association-Retired which represents 
well over 5,000 retired educational personnel across the state. 
Retirees ’ pensions are their lifeline. Unfortunately, we are in the 
position of constantly trying to catch up as we watch the value of our 
benefits decrease. The cap on our COLA, the taxable portion of our 
pensions, health insurance costs, and inflation all play roles in 
contributing to this decline. The hits keep coming from all sides. 
ln the last 2 years some small steps have been taken to try to improve 
the situation. While we are grateful for those efforts we feel that more 
could be and should be done. Moving fon/vard with LD1773 would 
offer another glimmer of hope to some of our retirees who are really 
struggling. It may not seem like much to some, but another $20-30 
dollars in one’s monthly paycheck could be a big deal for those who 
are struggling. 
In observance of Teacher Appreciation Week, it would be a great 
gesture of appreciation if this committee seriously considered 
supporting this bill to help the educators who have devoted numerous 
years of service to our state. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
