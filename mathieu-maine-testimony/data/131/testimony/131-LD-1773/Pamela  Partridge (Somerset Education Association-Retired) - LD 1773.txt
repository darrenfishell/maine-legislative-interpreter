Testimony In Support of LD 1773
May 9, 2023 
Dear Senator Raﬀerty, Representative Brennan and Members of the Education and Cultural Aﬀairs Committee,
I am writing in support of LD 1773, HP1136, An Act to Increase the State's Share of the Cost of Health Insurance for Retired Teachers. 
The cost of living has hit us hard this past year. Heating and utility costs and grocery bills have been particularly draining on monthly budgets. I was so pleased to see this bill come up for consideration as its passage will help retired educators make ends meet. Retirees want to be able to pay their bills and live with dignity. Please support the passage of this bill.
Sincerely, 
Pamela J. Partridge
President, Somerset Education Association-Retired
North Anson, Maine 04958
