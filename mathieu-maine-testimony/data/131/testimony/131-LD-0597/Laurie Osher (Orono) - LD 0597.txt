An
Act
to
Impr ove
Conditions
for
People
Living
in

by

Before
the
Joint

Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
introduce
and
express
my
support
for
LD
597:
An
Act
to
Impr ove
Conditions
for
People
Living
in
Recovery
Residences
by
Requiring
Appr oved
Discharge
and
T ransfer
Policies.
I
thank
Representative
Madigan
and
the
members
of
the
Maine
Association
of
Recovery
Residences
for
introducing
this
bill.
They
developed
the
bill
by
looking
at
similar
legislation
in
other
states.
The
drafters
of
the
bill
and
those
who
manage
recovery
residences
understand
that
relapse
is
a
part
of
recovery .
They
also
know
that
when
a
person
is
relapsing,
their
dangerous
behavior
is
a
problem
and
recovery
residence
managers
need
procedures
in
place
to
remove
the
person
from
the
recovery
residence
for
the
safety
and
sobriety
of
others
in
the
program.
The
goal
of
the
bill
is
to
keep
the
residents
of
the
recovery
residence
safe.
The
ideal
next
step
when
a
recovery
resident
relapses
involves
helping
them
get
into
a
different
program
that
meets
their
needs.
However ,
because
there
arenâ€™ t
enough
spaces
in
existing
programs,
the
resident
may
need
to
be
removed
before
an
appropriate
program
becomes
available.
The
goal
is
for
the
recovery
residences
we
do
have
in
Maine
to
be
safe
places
for
people
to
work
on
their
recovery .
And,
you
may
wonder
why
I
am
submitting
testimony
on
this
bill.
It
is
because
our
state
is
in
crisis,
and
when
there
is
a
crisis,
I
do
my
part
to
support
those
who
are
working
to
save
lives.
The
evidence
of
the
crisis
is
the
huge
number
of
our
citizens
are
dying
each
year
of
substance
abuse
disorder .
I
urge
you
to
join
me
in
supporting
this
bill,
as
it
provides
a
mechanism
to
protect
people
in
recovery
residences
from
those
who
are
making
those
residences
less
safe.
