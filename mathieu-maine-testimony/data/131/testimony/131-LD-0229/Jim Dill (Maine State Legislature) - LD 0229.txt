Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 229, An Act to Compensate Tribal Governments for Basic Training fora 
Law Enforcement Ofﬁcer Hired by Another Government Agency 
Before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 and 
the communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobseot Indian Island. I am here before you today 
to present LD 229, An Act to Compensate Tribal Governments for Basic Training for a Law 
Enforcement Officer Hired by Another Government Agency. 
Under current law, whenever a full-time law enforcement officer is trained at a police academy 
at the expense of a town of other governmental entity and is then hired by another governmental 
entity as a full-time law enforcement ofﬁce wilhinﬁve years ofgraduaringfrom the academy, 
that entity must reimburse the ﬁrst according to a speciﬁed formula. 
This bill simply seeks to include in Maine law tribal governments and full-time law enforcement 
officers who are trained at the Indian policy academy at the federal law enforcement training 
center. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I am happy to answer any questions you have of me. 
District 26: Bradley. Old To\\'n and Penobseot Indian Island
