IN SUPPORT  
Good afternoon, my name is Robert Bryant the Chief of Police for the Penobscot 
Nation.  
I am testifying today in support of this bill. I would have liked to have been here in 
person, however I am currently the only officer on -duty while this hearing is in 
session, as the Penobscot Nation Police Department is down to three sworn officers, 
to protect and serve the community.  
I along with my fellow Tribal Police Chief’s, have a deep reverence for the duties and 
responsibilities that are bestowed upon us as the head law enforcement officer for our 
communities.  
Part of our responsibility as law enforcement executives, is to provide trained 
individuals, to assist our community members in addressing issues, preventing crime, 
reducing fear, and creating a safe and he althy environment for everyone that resides 
on the reservation or visits our community.  
Tribal law enforcement agencies have always dealt with the issue of high turnover of 
officers, and this continues to this day. We have always looked at our departments as 
the training ground for other agencies, as many officers over the years, have used the 
tribal departments to gain their initial basic training to start their law enforcement 
career, only to move on to larger departments. These moves are mainly because o f 
higher pay and better retirement plans, an issue that we find difficult to tackle, 
because of our limited funding we receive to operate our law enforcement programs.

For years the training of our tribal officers, was conducted at the Maine Criminal 
Justice Academy, MCJA, so we were able to utilize the training fee reimbursement 
law, when officers left for another agency. Though the basic training at the Maine 
Criminal Justice Academy was very comprehensive and professionally conducted, it 
always lacked ma ny important components that is important for the officers that are 
tasked with servicing our tribal communities.  
Indian Country law enforcement officers face unique and complex challenges, that 
many of our non -tribal law enforcement counter parts are not aware of and which 
require specific trainings. Examples of this specialized training that is specific to 
Indian Country includes understanding tribal sovereignty, the impact of historical and 
generational trauma and how it relates to indigenous people, the  Indian Child Welfare 
Act, Indian Country jurisdictional issues, the indigenous artifacts laws, the challenges 
of working within small tribal communities along with other culturally related 
courses.  
To address these gaps in the training of our officers, a decision was made, to utilize 
the Basic Training course at the Indian Police Academy at the Federal Training 
Facility Center, FLETC, in Artesia, New Mexico. By doing this, we were able to have 
our officers instructed in the tribally specific courses, that they were not receiving at 
the Maine Criminal Justice Academy. The IPA trains our officers in all the required 
topics that they would receive at the MCJA, except for Maine criminal and traffic 
laws, something they receive during Phases I and II of the Pre -Service process. This 
Pre-Service training is completed prior to attending the basic academy at the IPA.  
The IPA training also fulfills the federal mandate, and contractual agreement, that 
requires our officers be trained at the Indian Police Academy.  
Wher e we were once able to utilize the “Training Fee Reimbursement” law to recoup 
the funds used to train these officers when they were hired by other agencies, we are 
now left out, because the language is specific to the Maine Criminal Justice Academy 
trainin g. With this exclusion, non -tribal departments are seeing this as a way of hiring 
our fully trained officers at no cost to them as we are not able to apply the current law

to these cases. These hirings of our tribal officers have increased more and more ov er 
the past five years, as other departments across the state are finding it more difficult in 
attracting and retaining officers also.  
The basic training at the IPA, like that at the MCJA, is still very costly to our tribal 
agencies, as we provide travel t o and from the facility, the needed equipment, 
uniforms, per diem to the officer and overtime to cover the vacancies created by the 
officer’s absence.  
Over the past four years, the Penobscot Nation, has lost three IPA trained officers to 
non-tribal agencie s, without receiving any reimbursement. Though this number may 
not seem high, it is when you are working with a total staff of five sworn officers.  
By passing this bill, you would assist the Tribes in recouping funds we have spent 
training new officers whe n they leave for other departments, and hopefully slow down 
these early departures that we have been experiencing.
