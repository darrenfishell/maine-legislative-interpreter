Maine Youth Justice
LD 1779
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety:
My name is Ideres Ali and I am an organizer with Maine Youth Justice. I reside in 
Lewiston, Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of 
LD 1779.
I am a young person in Maine who is currently fighting a case. Personally nothing 
major has happened because the system sees that I’m well educated and have a lawyer
so they can’t take that much advantage of me. I see how corrupt the juvenile system is
because incarcerated individuals aren’t really looked after or checked up on. Having 
young people locked away isolates them from their communities and causes them 
more harm than good. 
Maine has an opportunity for the young people to see there’s people out here that 
really care for them and will do whatever it takes for them to feel cared for and 
supported in their development. This bill will develop a continuum of care for youth 
and the support will be given by trained professionals. A needs assessment will find 
the root of the youth’s suffering and create a plan to meet those needs and keep them 
out of Long Creek.
 
I have a vision for my community to get along and limit crime by having community 
events and resources that everyone contributes too and feels that they belong 
somewhere. We can build resources with a lot of community service just for the 
benefit of the neighborhood.
        
In summary, LD 1779 would give young people a chance to rehabilitate by creating a 
continuum of care. For these reasons, I request this Committee to vote to ought to 
pass on LD 1779. 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely,
Indi Ali
