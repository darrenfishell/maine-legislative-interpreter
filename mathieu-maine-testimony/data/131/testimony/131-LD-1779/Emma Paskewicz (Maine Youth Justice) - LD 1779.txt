Re:

An
Act

Develop

of
care
for

for

Dear
Senator
Beebe-Center,
Representative
Salisbury,
and
Members
of
the
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety:
My
name
is
Emma
Paskewicz
and
I
am
an
organizer
with
Maine
Youth
Justice.
I
reside
in
Sanford.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1779.
My
step-father,
who
grew
up
in
Fall
River,
Massachusetts
(He’d
walk
out
his
front
door
and
see
people
get
shot)
was
in
the
system,
and
he
was
passed
back
and
forth
through
every
mental
health
institution
in
New
England
his
whole
childhood,
as
well
as
Long
Creek
and
other
Youth
“Development
Centers”.
I’ve
seen
ﬁrst-hand
the
damage
and
trauma
it
has
caused
him
that
he
struggles
to
heal
from,
and
he
doesn't
trust
any
authority
ﬁgure
because
of
it.
He
would
get
drugged
and
he’d
wake
up
in
a
completely
new
place
without
anyone
telling
him
he
was
being
transferred.
This
made
him
act
out
even
more,
and
made
him
completely
distrustful
of
anyone
in
authority,
as
well
as
caused
a
plethora
of
other
mental
health
issues,
on
top
of
what
he
already
had.
The
system
failed
him,
it
did
not
help
him
whatsoever,
all
it
did
was
make
things
worse
for
him.
He’d
also
hear
and
see
authorities
lie
ﬁrst-hand,
and
it's
always
their
word
against
yours.
Too
frequently,
the
police
ofﬁcers
lie,
and
it
just
escalates
the
situation
so
that
the
ofﬁcer
can
gain
even
more
power
over
you.
The
only
thing
that
Long
Creek
does
is
create
more
harm
that
ripples
throughout
Maine’s
communities,
and
force
more
youths
into
traumatic,
harmful
environments.
90%
of
youths
in
the
system
have
3
or
more
mental
health
diagnoses,
further
demonstrating
that
Long
creek
is
a
breeding
ground
for
exacerbating
mental
health
issues.
In
June
of
2022,
the
Department
of
Justice
sent
a
letter
to
the
State
of
Maine
notifying
the
state
that
they
are
in
violation
of
the
Americans
with
Disability
Act
by
segregating
children
with
mental
health
and
developmental
disabilities,
by
incarcerating
them
in
psychiatric
hospitals,
residential
facilities,
and
Long
Creek.
This
bill
would
help
our
struggling
youth
tremendously.
Most
kids
are
crying
out
for
help
because
they're
struggling
and
don't
know
how
to
help
themselves.
When
you
send
our
struggling
youth
to
Long
Creek,
you're
instilling
the
mind-set
that
they
are
a
criminal,
which
can
lead
them
down
the
wrong
path
if
they
feel
trapped
or
stuck.
All
Long
Creek
“develops”
is
more
problems
and
harm
for
young
people.
These
kids
just
need
help
and
community
support,
and
when
they
are
ripped
away
from
their
trusted
communities,
they
are
triggered
into
a
ﬁght
or
ﬂight
response,
and
in
Long
Creek,
you
can’t
run
or
hide
anywhere
so
why
are
we
surprised
they
are
triggered
to
ﬁght.
We
need
community-based
care
for
Maine’s
youth.
That
includes,
but
is
not
limited
to,
secure,
affordable,
rent
controlled
housing,
mental
health
resources
that
our
youth
can
actually
receive
and
afford,
substance
abuse
counseling,
community
programs
for
our
youth
(such
as
basketball
courts,
parks,
recording/art
studios,
community
technology
centers,
etc.),
and
more
programs
for
our
youths
that
are
staffed
by
people
they
can
trust..
In
summary,
LD
1779
would
vastly
help
our
youth
get
the
adequate
and
appropriate
help
and
support
they
desperately
need
and
deserve.
For
these
reasons,
I
request
this
Committee
vote
ought
to
pass
on
LD
1779.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration,
Emma
Paskewicz
