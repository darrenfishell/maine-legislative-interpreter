Testimony of Senator Brad Farrin
Presenting L.D. 331, Resolve, to Name a Bridge in the Town of Canaan After 
Staff Sergeant Richard Gerald Salsbury
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation
February 21, 2023
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation: I am Brad Farrin and I represent the people of Senate District 3, which includes 
towns in Kennebec, Somerset and Penobscot counties. I am before you today to present L.D. 
331, Resolve, to Name a Bridge in the Town of Canaan After Staff Sergeant Richard Gerald 
Salsbury. 
I was contacted a few months ago by the niece of the late Richard Salsbury, who requested that I 
submit legislation to name the newly constructed bridge on Route 2 (Main Street) in Canaan in 
honor of her heroic uncle, Richard Gerald Salsbury. I was more than pleased to follow through 
on this request that serves to honor such a distinguished legacy from our greatest generation. 
Mr. Salsbury’s story is a testament to the American legacy. He enlisted in the service 
immediately after his eighteenth birthday, and on August 1, 1943, Richard’s Liberator aircraft 
was downed by enemy fire during operation TIDAL WAVE in Bucharest, Romania. He was 
posthumously awarded on several major fronts – including the Purple Heart Medal, the Air 
Medal, and the Distinguished Flying Cross, among others. Recently, the Defense POW/MIA 
Accounting Agency announced the identification of his remains and the subsequent 
transportation of his remains to his hometown of Canaan, Maine. This legislation has been 
introduced to preserve Mr. Salsbury’s legacy and enhance public reflection surrounding those 
who have made the ultimate sacrifice. 
In addition to my support, the Canaan Select Board has submitted a letter expressing their 
support of this Resolve. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
