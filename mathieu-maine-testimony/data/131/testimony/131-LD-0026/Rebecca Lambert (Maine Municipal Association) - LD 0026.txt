Neither For Nor Against  
 
LD 26, An Act to Provide Postage Prepaid Return Envelopes to Voters Who Send Absentee 
Ballots by Mail  
 
February 6, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman , Representative Supica  and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert,  and I am  providing testimony neither for nor against  
LD 26 on behalf of the Maine M unicipal A ssociation ’s (MMA) 70- member Legislative Policy 
Committee  (LPC).   
Any effort to simplify and encourage voting is supported by municipalities across Maine, 
and with the increased interest in absentee voting, it makes sense to provide a postage paid return envelope s with absentee ballots. Municipal officials appreciate th at LD 26 would direct  the state  
to shoulder the f inancial responsibility of printing the postage paid envelopes , eliminating that 
potentially costly burden on the already tight budgets of municipalities. 
On its  face, this bill attempts to capture all absentee votes by eliminating the financial 
barrier of returning a voter’s  absentee ballot. However, municipal clerks have raised concerns 
that this may create confusion for local elections in that voters would expect the municipality to provide a return envelope to participate in local election s. In support of the municipal clerks, 
MMA strongly urges the Committee to consider language that would exempt a municipality 
from providing postage paid envelopes for local elections. 
For these reasons MMA’s LPC is neither for nor against LD 34. 
Thank you for your t ime and consider ing the municipal perspective on this issue .
