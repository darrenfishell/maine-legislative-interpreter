Testimony in Favor of LD 26 An Act to Provide Postage Prepaid Return Envelopes to 
Voters Who Send Absentee Ballots by Mail  
 
Greetings Senator Hickman and Representativ e Supica  and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs . My name is Bridget Quinn, and I am an 
Associate State Director of Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the  nation ’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization  dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony .  Today I am 
here to testify in favor of LD 26.  
 
The right to vote,  along with full and fair representation, is the most basic of all political 
rights, and AARP has long advocated for fair and simple election procedures that facilitate 
the high level of participation among  voters aged 50 and older.  We support expansive 
changes that increase access to absentee ballots and remove barriers  to voting , which is 
what the provisions of LD 26  accomplish .  
 
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Maine voters have increasingly voted by absentee 
ballot. The Secretary of State ’s office in October of 2022 announced that there wer e 
211,35 9 absentee ballot requests for the general election, more than the number  reques ted 
in 2018.  
 
LD 26 removes a barrier to voting by providing postage prepaid return envelopes for 
voters in the United States to help them return their absentee ballots by mail. Prepaying for 
shipment helps cost -burdened voters avoid having to pay to exer cise their ri ght to vote. We 
ask the members of the committee to vote in favor of LD 26. Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify, and if you have questions for me I can be contacted at bquinn@aarp.org  or at 
207-272 -8563 .  
 
Thank you,  
 
Bridget Quinn  
Associate State Director of Advocacy and Outreach
