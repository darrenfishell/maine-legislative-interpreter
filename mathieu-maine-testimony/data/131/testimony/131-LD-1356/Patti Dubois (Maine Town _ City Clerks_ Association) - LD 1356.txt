Re: LD1356  – An Act to Improve  the Local Referendum  Process  by Increasing  the 
Percentage  of the Population  Required  to Submit  a Local Referendum  Question   
 
Position: Neither For Nor Against 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1356 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee. 
 
Clerks noted that the increase in the number of signatures required from 10% to 25% of 
the number of votes cast at the last gubernatorial election is significant and may pose a 
barrier for citizens who wish to bring referenda forward.  Members suggested that a smaller 
increase, such as 15 or 20%, may be more palatable.   
 
Although certifying a higher number of signatures would result in more work for registrars, 
members indicated that this is not a significant concern.  Members indicated that they 
generally have very few of these come forward, but acknowledge that this bill is likely being 
brought forward due to some towns experiencing nuisance petitions that can become 
burdensome. 
 
Municipalities who have a local charter would not be impacted by this bill, if adopted, unless 
their charter specifically refers back to state statute.  Some charter communities have a 
two-step process, which requires a small number of voters to sign on to an effort before a 
formal petition process can be initiated.   
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at
