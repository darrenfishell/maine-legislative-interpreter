Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1356 - An Act to Improve the Local Referendum Process by Increasing the Percentage of the 
Population Required to Submit a Local Referendum Question  
April 25, 2023
 
 
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and members of the State and Local Government Committee, my name is Rebecca 
Lambert, and I am testifying today in opposition to LD 1 356 on behalf of the  Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) 
elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC).  
  Municipal officials appreciate  the intent ion of this bill but remain steady in their position to maintain local 
control. Currently, charter communities have the ability to amend  their charter to increase the threshold for th e 
number of voters required on a written petition for a municipal referendum  but those without a charter have no 
channels to change the threshold amount .  
In the spirit of keeping this decision local, t he LPC would ask the committee to kindly consider keeping the 
current standards but providing explicit authority for communities to increase the threshold if desired. Likewise, a 
threshold range could be considered, starting at the current threshold of 10%  going through 25% (or 15% per the 
proposed amendment), which would allow more flexibility for communities to assign the threshold that would work 
for their citizens.  
For these reasons the LPC is neither for nor against  LD 13 56. Thank you for your time an d for considering 
the municipal  perspective on this issue.
