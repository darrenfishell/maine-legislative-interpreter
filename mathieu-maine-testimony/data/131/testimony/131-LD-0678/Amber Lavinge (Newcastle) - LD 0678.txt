Good mommg, Senator Camey, Representatlve Monnen, and other lovely members of the 
]ud1c1ary comm1ttee My name 1s Amber La1vgne of Newcatle I am here today as a concemed 
mom to speak 1n support of LD 678 
I recently spoke w1th a mom of a young woman VVhen her daughter was 1n the forth grade, she 
went to several school employees to request that they use a mascul1ne name and pronouns VVhat 
d1d the school employees do, you may ask The school employees called her mom They asked 
her mom for guldance Her 1nom told them to contlnue to ut1l1ze the name she was g1ven at b1rth, 
and pronouns that correspond w1th her sex The school d1d JUS'[ that Today, that young lady 1sa 
beaut1ful, happy, thnvmg mom A mom who 1s so thankful that school ofﬁcrals d1dn’t follow her 
lead and leave her fam1ly out of a very d1fﬁcult conversat1on VVho knows where that young lady 
would be today 1f the school d1dn’t 1nclude the people who knew her best 1n the conversat1on, her 
parents 
Several weeks ago, I sat 1n a comm1ttee hearmg room wa1t1ng for the hear1ng to k1ck off, 
l1sten1ng to a group of people d1scuss1ngthe1r k1ds’ names They d1scussed the long process 1t 
took to name the1r k1ds They d1scussed the deeper mean1ng beh1nd those names I looked around 
the room and saw pr1de 1n those parents’ eyes as they _]0l(6d w1th one another I sat on the other 
s1de of the room, ﬁghtmg tears As a mom of a k1d struggl1ng w1th gender dysphor1a, I don’t get 
to celebrate my k1d’s name I don’t even get to use her name w1thout be1ng accused of 
“deadnam1ng ” my l3-year-old baby You see, th1s 1s a culture of death Dead names, dead fam1ly, 
dead frlends, dead memorres, dead photographs, threats of death 1f we don’t afﬁrm 
Socral trans1t1on 1s the 1n1t1al step Next comes puberty blockers, then cross sex hormones and 
surgerles For many, before they even enter adulthood
Befo1e tt ansgendensm became mamstleam, l<1ds chd not soc1allyt1ans1t1on They were mstead 
offered therapy that helped them work through what was maktng them feels so dlstressed bor 
most, th1s led to ltvmg a happy hfe ah gned wxth thclr born sex 
I was here testtlymg agamst several other hllls last week regardlng gender atﬁrmmg care AsI 
looked alound the room at the young people testlfymg for the hlll to pass, I eouldn’t help but 
notlee one eomanon theme among most of these heautttul young, people Alrested development 
These ktds were 1SOl€tl6d dunng therr soelal awakenmg due to COVID Many adopted new 
1dent1t1es onhne and heeame hypertoeused on those ldentltles It was the only soelal 1nte1 aettons 
they reeelved outslde of fannly Instead of Iindmg ways to get these young adults to work 
through thls chsttess, we are eelehlatmg then dlstress as they tote wtth them teddy hears and 
other stuffed ammals as eopm g mechamsms I can’t help but wonder what the future holds for 
them lt’s an elephant 1n the loom nobody wants to dlseuss 
As parents, our numbet one pnonty 1s to prepare our lads fox the real world To prepare them to 
be successful, mdependent, eontr1but1ng members ot soe1ety There are ways to support qulrky 
umqueness whrle also helpmg these k1(lS understand appropnate etlquette 1n the Ieal world How 
senously would I be taken today ll’ l stood hetore you holdmg my ehlldhood teddy to my chest as 
I spoke” We eventually have to put away ehlldtsh thrngs 
I ask you agam to do what the people of Mame want Please stop omlttmg parents ﬁom our klds’ 
hves As these klds grow lnto adulthood the love bomblng Wlll stop, and what wtll be left w1ll be 
a fannly, torn apart by d1st1 ess and mlstreatment We parents w11l be the1e to plCl( up the pleees, 
but at what cost”
The house voted to pass a bxll, LD 394, to allow soeml workers to keep 1nfo1m<1tlon ﬁom pcuento 
Pass tlns blll so that we can d1 aw a lme somewhere Changmg pronouns goes beyond pnvllcgecl 
eommunreatron It 1s an aetron step toward a medlcal oonveyer belt of ITl6(llCd1 treatment our Rldb 
can’t even begm to comprehend Please votc ought to pass LD 678
