LD 678 
I am writing today in support of LD 678. I 
will go a step further the given name at 
birth is the legal name of each person  
School papers homework etc should have 
the legal name on that work Unless legally 
changed in a court the only legal name is 
the one given at birth.. Your nickname does 
not qualify in your legal signature so should 
any other. I hope you will follow and vote in 
support  of LD 678
