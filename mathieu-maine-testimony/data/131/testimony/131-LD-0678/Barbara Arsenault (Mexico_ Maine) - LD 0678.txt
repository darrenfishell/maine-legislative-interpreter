Barbara Arsenault
Mexico, Maine
LD 678
Dear Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonen and members of the Judicial
Committee, 
My name is Barbara C. Arsenault . I am a resident of Mexico (Maine) and a retired 
high school guidance counselor. I am testifying against LD678. 
I understand the intent is for students to communicate to parents if they wish to be 
referred to in reference to another gender. 
It was mentioned in a sponsors testimony that this bill would not violate the 
confidentiality that is part of a conversation in a guidance office but that is not part of 
the text in the bill. The confidentiality is imperative in a guidance office. 
I also am concerned with the unintentional consequences of the bill as so many 
students simply go by nicknames or by their middle name . I asked my legislators, 
Rep. Tammy Schmersal - Burgess and Senator Keim if I understood it correctly that 
parental permission would be needed if a student wanted to be called Ron instead of 
Ronald.  Rep. Schmersal - Burgess did not respond to that question and Sen. Keim 
responded that she thought it would be ANY name that woul be different than the 
name on the birth certificate. Would this be an annual permission slip? If so I believe 
this is an unnecessary burden. 
Thank you for your time. Barbara C. Arsenault M.Ed.
