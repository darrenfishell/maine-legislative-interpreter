LD 678
I'm writing to you in support of  LD 678, An Act to Require Parental Approval for 
Public School Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other than a Child's Given 
Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the Gender on the Child's Birth Certificate.
This bill prohibits a public school employee from using a name or pronoun to address 
or refer to a student that does not match information provided on the student's birth 
certificate without written permission from the student's parent or legal guardian.
This bill seems like common sense to me and it supports parental rights. I urged the 
committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 678.
