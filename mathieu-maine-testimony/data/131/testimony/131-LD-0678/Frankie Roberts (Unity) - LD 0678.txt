Unity
LD 678
Good Afternoon, 
My name is Frankie Roberts. I’m a resident of Unity. I am here today as a member of 
LWVME’s Youth Council. This program helps young people to explore how Maine’s
government works and build their civic leadership skills. This testimony does not 
represent LWVME’s view only those of the Youth Council. I am testifying against 
LD 678.
If LD 678 is passed, transgender and non-binary kids all throughout Maine will feel 
threatened, frightened, and unprotected. 
Despite Maine having the reputation of a welcoming and progressive state, there are 
still a number of closed minded individuals that live in our state. Unfortunately, some 
of these individuals are parents or guardians to transgender and non-binary youth– 
therefore making their homes an unaccepting place to live. When this is the case, 
many of these kids may find school to be their safe place. 
Schools are supposed to be a welcoming environment where students feel safe and 
accepted, which includes students’ right to be referred to with the correct pronouns 
and name. As stated before, some households are not a good environment for 
transgender and non-binary youth, and instead, these kids find comfort and safety at 
school. Whether it’s from some of their favorite faculty or fellow peers; when 
students cannot be referred to correctly at home, they rely on this affirmation at 
school. By passing LD 678, the state of Maine is depriving students of this safe 
environment. For the sake of the transgender and non-binary youth in our state, LD 
678 ought not to pass.
Thank you for your time,
Frankie Roberts
