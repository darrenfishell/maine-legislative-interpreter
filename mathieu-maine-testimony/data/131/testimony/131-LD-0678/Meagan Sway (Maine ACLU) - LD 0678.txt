Name or Pronoun Other than a Child’s Given Name or Pronqun

( 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings My name 1S Meagan Sway, and I am 
Policy Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving C1V1l liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U S Constitutions On behalf of our members, I urge you to I'6]6Ct 
LD 678 
If enacted, LD 678 would prohibit public school employees from referring to 
students by a name that does not “match the name listed on the student’s birth 
certificate ” or “[u]se a pronoun to address or refer to a student unless that pronoun 
corresponds to the gender listed on the student’s birth certificate ” without written 
permission from the student’s parent or legal guardian 
This could put Maine school employees on a collision course with state and federal 
law, in cases Where transgender students ’ gender identities do not match their sex 
at birth and parents refuse to give written consent for the school to use the child’s 
preferred name and/or gender identity Courts could find that school employees who 
do not recognize a child’s gender identity violate the Maine Human Rights Act, 
Article 1, section 6-A of the Maine Constitution, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution, among other laws 
In addition to potentially violating numerous existing laws, LD 678 would 
]60paI'd1Z6 the health and Wellbeing of Maine’s LGBTQ children According to the 
National Education Association, using correct pronouns at schools creates safe 
learning environments and improves learning outcomes and attendance Without 
this additional barrier to living authentically, 75% of Maine students already report 
regularly hearing negative remarks about gender expression Among LGBTQC
students 1n Ma1ne, 57% reported experlencmg verbal harassment and 28% reported 
e1ther phys1eal harassment or assault1 
As the Supreme Court stated 1n 1ts landmark op1n1on 1n Tanker v Des Momes, 
students do not “shed thelr constltutlonal r1ghts to freedom of speech or express1on 
at the schoolhouse gate "2 Transgender and non-blnary k1ds are ]ust that ~ klds— 
and they deserve the same 0pportun1t1es, 1nclus1on, and communlty as all others 
No ch1ld should face d1scr1m1nat10n or be margmallzed s1mply for l1v1ng true to how 
they were born We urge you to vote ought not to pass
