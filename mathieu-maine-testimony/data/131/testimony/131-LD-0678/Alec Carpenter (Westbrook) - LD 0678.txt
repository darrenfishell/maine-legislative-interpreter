Please vote against this bill. Children are entitled to their privacy. Additionally, this is
adding what seems to me to be an unnecessary administrative strain on school 
employees. All names not seen on a birth certificate must be in writing for parents? 
This means nicknames, things like Ben, Mike, Jess, Josh, Alex, etc etc these all must 
be put in writing? So they don’t spend their whole school careers going by Benjamin, 
Michael, Jessica, Joshua, Alexander/Alexandr(i)a? What happens if a parent hears a 
teacher call their kid Ken because all of their friends calls the kid Ken but the parent 
never gave the school permission to refer to their son Kenneth by that name? They 
have every right to make a big to-do about that. 
The unintended consequences of this bill are not only time consuming but they are 
also a little bit silly. On an unsilly note, again, children deserve a certain amount of 
privacy even from their parents. If you think they don’t, you should probably take a 
deep look inside of yourself to figure out why that is. 
Don’t vote in favor of this bill, it’s so silly.
