The fact that this is happening in our schools sickens me.  It is not up to the 
State/Education to decide or administer to a child's identity.  That is a parental right --
exclusively.  A person has a name and gender w applicable pronouns -- as established 
on their birth certificate -- and what legal right does the education system have to 
change it?  NONE.  PLEASE kill this bill.
