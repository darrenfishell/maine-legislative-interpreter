LD 678
Greetings:
I wish to voice my support for LD 678.  It is the role of parents to guide and support 
their growing children.  It is inappropriate for schools and school employees to hide 
from parents actions that may not have the approval of the parents.  This includes 
using non appropriate gender incorrect pronouns.  The schools should work as 
partners with the parents and not undermine the parent-child relationship.
