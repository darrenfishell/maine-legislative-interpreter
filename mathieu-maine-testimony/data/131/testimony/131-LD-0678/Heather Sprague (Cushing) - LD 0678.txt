Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished 
members of the Judiciary committee 
I'm Heather Sprague from Cushing and I'm here to support bills LD93o and 
LD678 
Here I am once again defending women and children from reckless 
irresponsible adults that work in the legislature and inside our schools that 
think they know our children better than us parents and from people who don't 
understand the stark differences between men and women 
I don't understand why the government in Maine thinks it can insert itself into 
the family, causing chaos and discontent all because they FEEL they know 
what's best for our women and children better than we do 
I can't understand why people think it's ok for males to compete against females 
when we all know that men are built differently than women Feelings will not 
change that fact and I myself as a woman am very offended by these 
incompetent actions taken against us in the name of "equality" 
I support these bills for two reasons 
1 to have parental consent in order for public school officials to call our kids 
anything but the names we have given them, all because our kids have had their 
minds warped at school into thinking they are another gender when in FACT we 
send them there to learn ACADEMICS not what sex they are or what sex anyone 
else is for that matter 
2 There is plenty of evidence that men in fact harm women when they compete 
against them in any sport Just because a man feels feminine does NOT mean 
they are female or can ever become a female 
It is very clear to me that our Democrat Governor, Democrat Reps and Senators, 
the democrat run MDOE, the Maine Council of Churches, the Peoples Alliance 
of Maine, Equality Maine, of which democrat co chair and Representative 
Moonen sits as executive director of, which is a conﬂict of interest because it 
serves only the LGBTQ+ communities excluding all others including 
students/people who do not identify as LGBTQ+ discriminating against them 
and defying the MHRA when he's a sitting elected official and is suppose to serve 
all his people, and other politically charged non proﬁts only have their special
interests in mind and have thrown away their policies of doing what's best for 
everyone in their communities as a whole and instead have inserted their own 
beliefs, politically charged opinions and special interests ignoring the lTl2l]0I ‘lty 
of people they say they serve 
I am appalled by the behaviors of our Democrat elected OlﬁCl8.1S for only siding 
with their party, not listening to all of their constituents, only a very small 
IIl&]OI'1ty of them and by passing only their bills and voting down good bills like 
the two I’m supporting created by responsible Republicans that have listened to 
their constituents and only seek to deliver positive common sense policies to 
their communities instead of radical politically charged policies put out by those 
Dems that hurt the people not help them 
I know what I say 1S irrelevant to the democrat members of this committee as 
they cant see or hear through their hatred for their conservative constituents or 
concerned citizens such as myself and only want to hear from paid lobbyists, 
confused brainwashed children and the radical left 
I would like to thank the Republican members of this committee for staying true 
to their core values and not caving to special interests I ask that you vote to 
pass these very important bills and take what I have said today into 
consideration when in the work session 
I leave you with this quote 
"You need power, only when you want to do something harmful, otherwise love 
1S enough to get everything done"
