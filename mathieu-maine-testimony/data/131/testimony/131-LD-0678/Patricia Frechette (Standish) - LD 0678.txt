dear Committee Members; 
  It only makes sense that the parent has a right to know if the school employees are 
using  different names for their child and also why they are doing it.  It seems the 
parents are taking a back seat to their children and that should not be happening.   The
Parents are responsible for their children until they turn 18.  Stop trying to take that 
away!
I respectfully request that you vote 
OUGHT to Pass on this bill.
