Testimony m Opposltion to L.D. 678, An Act to Require Parental Approval for Publtc School 
Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun 
Corresponding to the Gender on the Chlld'S Birth Certiﬁcate 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen, and d1stmgu1shed members of the Jud1c1ary 
Commrttee, my name 1s Aaron Frey, and I have the pr1v1lege of servmg as Mame’s Attomey 
General I am here today to speak 1n oppos1t1on to L D 678, An Act to Require Parental Approval 
for Publzc School Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other than a Child's Gzven Name or 
Pronoun Corresponding to the Gender on the Chzld's Birth Certiﬁcate 
Schools have a legal oblrgatron to provrde a safe and 1nclus1ve educatron to all students 
who attend When a student presents to a teacher askmg to be called by pronouns or a drfferent 
name, 1t 1s most hkely the ﬁrst outward srgns they are explonng the1r gender rdentlty Whrle 1t 1s 
always the hope and the goal that parents are the ﬁrst to be notrﬁed when a ch1ld 1s questronrng 
thts way, we know that sometrmes home 1s not always the place a clnld feels safest 
When a school refuses to make a learnmg envrromnent a safe place for chrldren w1th 
expressed 1dent1t1es protected under the Marne Human Rrghts Act, 1t makes the school vulnerable 
to legal actron, Just as the fa1lure to accommodate any other protected class mrght be 1n an 
educatronal settrng From th1s standpomt, refusmg to accommodate a ch1ld’s professed gender 
1dent1ty wrthout parental permrssron could ultrmately cost srgmﬁcant t1me and money for schools 
We saw th1s ﬁrsthand m the Doe v Regzonal School Unzt 26, 86 A 3d 600, 607 (Mame 2014), 
where the Law Court found that farlmg to allow a student to use the restroom consrstent w1th her 
gender 1dent1ty mterfered wrth the student’s ab1l1ty to learn and succeed 
Practrcally speaklng, plac1ng school staff 1n between a ch1ld’s professed wrshes and parents 
1s an unworkable dynamlc that undermmes a school’s ab1l1ty to achreve 1ts prrmary goal of 
educatmg students 
I urge the commrttee to vote Ought Not To Pass L D 678
