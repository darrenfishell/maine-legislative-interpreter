Good afternoon I am Mary Bonauto, a Maine-based attorney who Works for GLBTQ 
Legal Advocates & Defenders GLAD is a legal organizatlon advocatmg for the full range of 
c1v1l rights for LGBTQ people and people l1v1ng w1th HIV/AIDS 1n New England and nationally 
Together with the Amerrcan Academy of Ped1atr1cs — Marne Chaper, MaineTransNet, and OUT 
Maine, We oppose LD 678, “An Act An Act to Requzre Parental Approval for Public School 
Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other than a Chzla"s Gzven Name or Pronoun 
Correspondzng to the Gender on the Chzld's Bzrth Certtficate” 
First and foremost, this rule will not help young people. If a student asks to usea 
different name or pronoun at school, it 1S because they are exploring or testing out the1r identlty, 
or because they are deeply uncomfortable w1th the name and gender they have been asslgned If 
they are exploring, or if they need support to ﬁgure out how to talk to their parents or 
guardian about their questions or discomfort, then this bill tells them to suppress who they 
are. Suffice it to say that this doesn’t support their education at school. It doesn’t work for 
young people; in fact, it is horribly dangerous. 
What is also forgotten in the current debate isthat school staff and teachers are 
often the ﬁrst ones to encourage a student to share their concerns with a parent. It is widely 
accepted, and for good reason, that a strong parent-child relat1onship helps a young person 
throughout the1r lives Young people care about their families, too, and are often very 
invested in ﬁnding a way, with sometime and support, to open up about important parts of 
themselves with their parents even though the discussion could be challenging. This bill 
cuts off support and puts up roadblocks to the path forward. 
Second, from a school’s perspective, the school must be student-centered, oriented 
to keeping students safe and engaging their learning and development so they can 
ultimately take their place as adults in our society. Schools share this cornmltment w1th 
parents, although each plays dlfferent roles Because educators are committed to students 
learnrng and growlng, they strive to ensure that a student’s personal characteristlcs, mcluding 
transgender status and gender do notaffect the student’s access to a learmng envlromnent 1n 
whrch they can engage fully This commitment also derives from legal obligations imposed 
on schools to ensure that schools provide equal opportunities to all students and avoid 
discrimination based on sex, transgender status, and gender identity.~

Those nondiscrimination rules are enforced against schools. ‘ This legal principle 
means that all children must be able to attend schools safely and get the education they 
deserve, including transgender young people. In 2014, the Maine Law Court was the ﬁrst 
state supreme court to rule that state nondiscrimination law protected a transgender 
student’s right to use the restroom consistent with her gender identity because it was 
important for the student’s well-being and success at school). Doe v. Regional School Unit 
26, 86 A.3d 600, 607 (Maine 2014) (“Where, as here, it has been clearly established thata 
student’s psychological well-being and educational success depend upon being permitted to 
use the commuinal bathroom consistent with her gender identity, denying access to the 
appropriate bathroom constitutes [gender identity] discrimination in violation of the [state 
law against dlSCl'llIlIl1atI0l1]. ”).2

Third, this bill does not protect parents’ rights. \

l\ 
I Although this hardly does justice to the potential role of parents in a child’s life, parents 
have enormous access to and inﬂuence over their children, including the ability to develop a 
strong, positive and loving relationship with them. Parents often share their views and 
values with their children, guide and show them how to be a good friend, sibling, son or 
daughter, and more. In other words, what is most protective of parents’ rights is the 
relationship that parents develop with their children. This Committee saw that on display

In 2005, the Mame legislature enacted a statute to ensure that “[n]o person shall be excluded from 
participation in, denied the beneﬁts of, or be subjected to discrimination in public schools” based on their 
membership in a protected class, including based on sexual orientation and gender identity This law was 
upheld in a people’s veto campaign that unsuccessfully attempted to repeal that law 
In accord with legislative and judicial determinations (see below), the Maine Human Rights 
Commission controlling interpretation of the Maine Human Rights Act is that “A student’s ofﬁcial record shall 
bear their legal name, which may be changed only upon proof that the student’s legal name has been changed 
pursuant to a court order At the written request of a student, however, and consistent with the student’s gender 
identity, the educational institution shall use the student’s preferred name and pronouns consistent with their 
gender identity on all other documents ” Barbara Archer-Hirsch, Letter to Amy Sneirson, re Interpretation of 
Maine Human Rights Act (Jan 13, 2016) at 3, available at

school administrative units have adopted versions of policies about supporting students who are transgender or 
gender nonconforming,

A 
in Friday’s hearing on LD 535 with parents nearly bursting with love and pride for their 
children testifying about the need for access to gender affirming care for certain minors. 
This bill puts young people in the position of suppressing their distress, fears and 
concerns, even if they need some safety valve outside of the home, including school, to 
acknowledge their concerns. It 1sn’t surprising that students need time to share these concerns 
at home, and even more so when they are uncertain about their feelings about their gender, or 
may need time to collect information from external sources about how to talk with their parents 
While parents have a broad and powerful inﬂuence on their children, the partnership of 
schools and parents for the safety and learning of students is an asset for students, families 
and schools. We don’t need a law to state the obvious: that parents can check in with 
teachers about their own student’s well-being and progress, that they can follow their 
child’s assignments, readings, and progress through “Power School” and “Blackboard. ” 
Schools also typically engage in “parental engagement ” efforts to mamtam communication 
with parents in the_school community.3 Parents can attend school board meetings and 
register their thoughts as the school board decides on policy and curriculum. 
In addition, parents have longstanding legal rights nationwide to obtain school- 
maintained records about their student under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy 
Act (FERPA)4 and other materials through the Pupil Privacy Protection Act (PPRA).5 
Among many other things, the PPRA also provides for parental consent to surveys with 
particular topics, including inspection of the survey on request, as well as notice and an 
opportunity to opt out of various surveys, and health examinations (with exceptions), and 
the “inspection ” of “instructional ” used by a “local educational agency” as part of the 
educational curriculum. 1 
All of this said, there is no legal obligation to export what parents would counsel at 
home into a requirement on schools, even under the rubric of the parents’ rights to direct 
the “care, custody and control” of their child. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000) 
(plurality opn.). 
What is crystal clear is that parents have the recognized fundamental right to decide 
whether their child should attend public or private school or be home schooled. Crowley v 
McKinney, 400 F 3d 965, 971 (7th Cir 2005) (the parental right is “the right to choose the 
school” but not “a right to participate in the school's management —a right inconsistent 
with preserving the autonomy of educational institutions, which is itself an interest of 
constitutional dignity. ” Id 
However, the constitution does not require parental preferences to be imposed on how 
public schools operate their day-to-day activities Parents “do not have a due process right to

engagement policy)

' 
Notably, 1n the Infrequent parental rights cases m the educatlon context, many 
courts find that the parent’s asserted rlght lS not a legal rlght, but a preference fora 
partlcular course of action. -As a result, courts often ﬁnd that a school has not vlolated 
parents’ r1ghts.8 
Stated another way by the F1rst C1rcu1t Court of Appeal, s a parent’s r1ght to brmg up 
the1r chlldren does not extend to “dlrect how a pubhe school teaches the1r ch1ld ”9 Schools, too, 
have constltutional obligations to fulﬁll, and 1n dolng so, must have dlscretlon, durlng the

As to the limitations on staff discussions proposed in this bill, those should fail for 
the same reasons discussed in the above cases. That is to say, in the ordinary course, staff 
can likewise be required to use names as stated by the student at school. This is because 
doing so supports the sti1dent ’s well-being and learning at school.“ These 0b_]0CﬁV6S are the 
very reason school administrative units employ teachers and staff. \ 
For all of the above reasons, we urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 678.
