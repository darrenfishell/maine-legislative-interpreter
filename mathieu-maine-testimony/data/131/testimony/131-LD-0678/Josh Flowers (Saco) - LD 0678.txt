I think students should have a right to privacy. Simple as that. They’re in a confusing 
time of their lives, more questioning than any other generation before them. What 
good does sacrificing the privacy of students, especially in topics that do not injure 
others or themselves, do for the school system? Eliminate trust between student and 
teachers? Keep students closed off and afraid to ask questions they may regret not 
asking earlier? I can simply see no good benefits to abandoning this privacy. 
As a queer man, it took me a long time to come to terms with my own sexuality, and 
part of that was not feeling like I was allowed to ask questions about myself in high 
school. I felt no safety, no trust, no privacy, and to this day I still wrestle with the 
habits and thoughts that left in me. We don’t need to raise a generation of adults who 
might hate themselves like I had.
