A school has an in loco parentzs role when children are in its care, which includes the 
obligation to protect all students and provide them with a safe and equal learning 
enviromnent Part of creating such an enviromnent is addressing a student by the name 
and pronouns that are consistent with their gender identity Numerous studies show that 
this affirmation — and respect — is critical to the health and well-being of all students, 
particularly transgender and gender-diverse people When LGBTQ+ students view 
school staff as supportive, they feel safer, have better attendance, and show better school 
performance,1 and statistics further show that suicide rates drop when correct names and 
pronouns are used 
The student-school relationship is of course distinct from the student-family relationship, 
notwithstanding the custodial dynamic of the former during the school day As education 
professionals, it’s to be expected that school staff retain authority over their educational 
methods and practices as SLlb_]6C'[ matter experts Ultimately, schools aim to provide 
supportive and afﬁrming environments for students m coordmatzon with parents,

encouragmg students to have open commun1cat1on w1th the1r fam1l1es when they are 
ready to do so Every student, however, 1s un1que, as 1s every fam1ly, the student may 
not be out yet to the1r parents, or 1t may be too dangerous to even cons1der 
Fundamentally, students have a r1ght to express themselves at school 1n a Way that 1s 
dlfferent from how they express themselves at home, and teachers should not be tasked 
w1th shar1ng every detarl about th1s behavlor - part1cularly when there has been a request 
for some conﬁdent1al1ty and pr1vacy 2 
To deputlze school staff 1n carry1ng out parental 
authorlty and demands under every clrcumstance 1s L111_]l.1S'[, burdensome, and 1n some 
crrcumstances would force school staff to knowmgly put a ch1ld 1n harm’s way 
Fmally, among the reasons that a student may w1sh to use a d1fferent name 1nclude 
havlng a name that 1s commonly mlstaken for another student’s name, preferrmg a 
mckname, or hav1ng a name that 1s d1ff1cult to pronounce To requlre parental approval 
1s unnecessar1ly bureaucrat1c at best and deeply hurtful and poss1bly fatal at worst We 
urge you to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 678 and apprec1ate your cons1derat1on
