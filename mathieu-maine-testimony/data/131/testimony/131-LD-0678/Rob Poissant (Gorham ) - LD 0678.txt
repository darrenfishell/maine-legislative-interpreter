My name is Rob Poissant. I’m a resident of Gorham. 
LD678. An Act to Require Parental Approval for Public School Employees to Use a 
Name or Pronoun Other than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the 
Gender on the Child's Birth Certificate ought to pass.
As a parent, my children were not “assigned” their sex at birth.  The sex of our 
newborn was given by God . The problem we are experiencing today is that gender is 
being used to refer to a psychological reality independent from biological sex. Gender
is the subjective self-perception of being male or female. As a parent , I reject the use 
of others using a
psychological concept of preferred pronouns for my children. The truth of our son 
being a male and given his male name is objective , while gender is subjective. Our 
culture now values altering the objective, physical reality of my body to accommodate
the subjective impression of myself. My sense of self  describes how I feel , but  not 
the truth of who I am. Public school employees should be required to affirm the name 
given to our child on their Birth Certificate and seek approval for the use of any 
pronoun.
Thank you.
