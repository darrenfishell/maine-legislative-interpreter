Testimony in Support of LD 678
An Act to Require Parental Approval for Public School Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other
than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the Gender on the Child's Birth Certificate  
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:
My name is Nathan Gould; I am a lifelong resident of Winterport. I am writing this testimony in
support of LD 678, “An Act to Require Parental Approval for Public School Employees to Use a Name or
Pronoun Other than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the Gender on the Child's 
Birth Certificate.”
We’ve seen a dramatic shift in attitude among school employees, one that seems to show a 
hostility towards parents. Parents are the guardians of their children and schools should work with 
them instead of behind their backs. High-profile cases like that of the Great Salt Bay Community 
School in Damariscotta secretly counseling a student without informing her parents highlight the issue
of the rights of parents being trampled upon.
The child-parent relationship should be protected, not subverted. What more fundamental 
aspect of this relationship is there than the child’s name, given by the parents? This must be 
respected. Schools should cooperate with parents and support them in their duty to protect and 
provide for the children God has given them, not subvert it. Children belong neither to the education 
system nor the government; our Creator has given children to their parents and guardians to be 
stewards over them until they are prepared to enter the world of adulthood. This family unit is crucial 
to our society; attacking it attacks the foundation of our civilization.
Let the matter of a student’s name be the prerogative of the parents, and let the parents’ 
wishes be respected. I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for reading one more 
testimony.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
