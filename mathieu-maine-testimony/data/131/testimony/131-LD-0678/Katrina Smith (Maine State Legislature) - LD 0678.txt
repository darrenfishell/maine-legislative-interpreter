Testimony 
ln Support of 
LD 678 An Act to Require Parental Approval for Public School Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun 
Other than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the Gender on the Child's Birth Certificate 
Good Afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary committee My 
name is Katrina Smith and I represent District 62, China, Palermo, Somerville, Windsor and Hibberts GoreI 
am here today to present to you LD 678: “An Act to Require Parental Approval for Public School 
Employees to Use a Name or Pronoun Other than a Child's Given Name or Pronoun Corresponding to the 
Gender on the Child's Birth Certificate ” 
The premise of this bill is that if a child goes to school and decides that they want to be called by a name 
different than what is on their birth certificate, the school then must receive written permission froma 
parent for school employees to use that name change The name change could be that Fred wants to be 
called Junior, Susan wants to be called Susie, or that Mark wants to be called Sheila Regarding pronouns, 
if a girl wants to go to school and have the pronoun to address her be he or him then a note is to be sent 
home to receive permission from a parent for that request to be honored 
l want to be clear to you about this bill as some have maligned its intent This bill is presented to protect 
the rights of parents to be the sole authority in the lives of their children This bill does not say that these 
name or pronoun changes cannot go forward, but merely that a parent must be informed and approve of 
any requests for changes 
l also am not talking about breaking the confidence of the chapter 117 statute which allows confidentiality 
with a counselor at a school l am speaking about a school wide name or pronoun change of whicha 
parent IS unaware 
In the Winslow school system, iust this year, a schoolwide memo went out describing a pronoun change 
that a child wanted This memo however, requested that no one should tell the students ’ parents because 
the student did not want them to know Do we really think that if a child changes their name or pronoun 
in school that a parent isn't going to find out’ Do we think a school IS a bubble in which classmates don't 
go home and tell their parents what is going on and then that students ’ parents hear about it’ How is it 
helping a child for a parent to hear through the grapevine that their child is being called by a different 
name or pronoun’
We, as legislators need to take a serious look at what IS going on in our schools and the discontent that is 
brewing there We need to show leadership so that we avoid situations that are growing more volatile We 
must protect our teachers, administrators and our parents from the discord that has occurred in school 
board meetings, in the local media and on social media We cannot keep putting parental rights on the 
back burner like it doesn't matter what a parents thoughts are regarding the upbringing of their own 
children 
Why are parents seen as an enemy to the child when the parent is the one who has known, loved, and 
cared for this child since birth’ What proof is there that the default should be to not involve the parent 
instead of defaulting to involving the parent in life-altering decisions ’ 
l urge you to pass LD 678
