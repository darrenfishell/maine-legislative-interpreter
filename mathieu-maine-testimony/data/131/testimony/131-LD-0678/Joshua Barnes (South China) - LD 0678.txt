Good afternoon,
My name is Joshua Barnes, and I pastor the Second Baptist Church in Palermo Maine.
I am affiliated with dozens of churches across our state representing thousands of 
constituents. I wanted to testify in favor of this bill. One of the bedrock foundations of
our nation has been the family unit. The relationship between parents and children. I 
think I can speak on behalf of us all when I say that no parent wants another person or
entity to discuss and approve life choices with our children outside of parental 
knowledge and consent. 
This bill is not a message of discrimination or hatred towards any people group, but 
promotes the idea of family and the concept that parents know best for their kids. 
Parents should always be included in conversations about their children and should 
give or withhold consent before life choices are implemented. Parental approval is 
required for certain employment opportunities for minors, military service for 17 year 
olds, and many other endeavors. 
There may be other groups, including alleged “faith-based” groups who oppose this 
bill or insinuate that anyone who supports this bill is harassing or hindering certain 
people groups. These faith based groups are opposing this bill based on political 
affiliation and/or peer pressure. I do not identify with any political parties of Maine. 
Being free and clear of any political ties or affiliations, I speak solely from the 
position of a concerned parent in Maine. Furthermore, I speak based on the 
Scriptures. Parental approval of their children’s choices does not contradict liberty or 
Christianity. Rather, there is needed guidance and safety for our kids when parents are
involved and can withhold or grant approval in matters like there where our young 
and often impressionable children are involved. 
Please support the future safety of our children by voting to keep parents in charge of 
their kids’ well being.
