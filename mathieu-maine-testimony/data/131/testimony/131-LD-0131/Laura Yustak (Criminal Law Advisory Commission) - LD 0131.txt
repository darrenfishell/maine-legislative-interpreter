RE: LD 131, An Act to C larify and Correc t Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Laws  
 
DA: April 19, 2023  
 
 
 The Criminal Law Advisory Commission (CLAC)* respectfully submits the following  
testimony in neither for nor against LD 131.   We write only to identify  a potential constitutional  
issue with Section 6 of the bill.    
 
 Section 6 appears to authorize a warrant less, nonconsensual test t o determine the presence of 
alcohol or other in toxicants in the blood if there is probable cause that a person involved  in a 
“hunting incident ” or vehicle  crash is impaired  and that “serious injury ” or death ha s occurred  or 
will occur .   LD 131 does not take into consideration the existence or not of exigent circumstances.   
See Mitchell v. Wisconsin , 139 S.Ct. 2525 (2019);  People v Eubanks , 160 N.E.3d 843 (I L 2019).   
The Legislature  recently amended Title 29 -A statutes  and repealed  former 29 -A M.R.S. 2 522 to 
respond  to the Law Court ’s decision in State v Weddle , 2020 ME 12, which addressed  the 
constitutional  implications of such an a pproach.   P.L. 2021, c. 608, Part A ; LD 1903 ( 130th Leg., 
Summary) .   The Maine Legislature ’s response  to Weddle  in Chapter 608 allows the determination 
of exigent circumstances to rest o n the facts of each cas e.  CLAC recommends  that a similar  
approach be taken here .   
 
 We also note the following  terminology issues in Section 6 :  If “hunti ng incident ” and 
“serious injury ” are not defin ed terms in Title 12, the se terms may not be sufficiently precise to 
provide guidance to law en forcement or the courts.    The Criminal Code distinguishes betwe en 
“bodily injury ” and “serious  bodily injury ,” which are defined in 17 -A M.R.S. § 2(5), (23) .  See, 
e.g., 29 -A M.R.S. § 2411  (OUI statute referencing “serious bo dily injury ”).    
 
*CLAC  is an advisory body established by the Legislature.   17 -A M.R.S. §§ 1351 -1357.    It 
consists of 9 members appointed by the Attorney General.  Our current members include current 
defense attorneys, prosecutors, Maine  Bar Counsel , and a retired practition er with experience as 
defense counsel, prosecutor and in court administration.    In addition, three sitting judges and one 
retired practitioner, appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, and, by statute, 
the Co -Chairs of the Legislatur e’s Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, serve as 
consultants.  The Supreme Judicial Court’s Criminal Process Manager serves as liaison from the 
Court to CLAC.   CLAC advises the Legislature on matters relating to crimes in the Criminal Code 
and in other Titles, the Bail and Juvenile Codes, and with respect to other statutes related to criminal 
justice processes.
