Testimony In Support of L D 231, An Act to Support the Maine Pediatric and Behavioral Health Partnership 
Program . 
 
My name is Nancy Cronin , and I am the Executive Director  of the Maine Developmental Disabilities (DD) 
Council.1   The Maine Pediatri c and Behavioral Health Partnership Pro gram  provides a warm line for 
Pediatricians to access  real time consultation  with behavioral health p roviders  so that they can assist their 
patients  quickly.   
 
Supporting medical professionals caring for their patients at a time in which behavioral h ealth services are 
scarce is an excellent strategy .  Having access to timely behavioral  health care will likely decrease emerg ency 
and c risis service usage .  Right now , this grant is being administered through the CDC because the service 
provides  medical consultation  to medical profession als so they can give real-time care to their pe diatric 
patients .  It might  be a  logical assumption  that OCFS Behavioral Services  should administer this pro gram , but 
we believe  that would be a mistake .  This service is improving pediatric healthcare , which  includes behavioral 
health, for all chi ldren.  OCFS administers programs funded  through MaineCare while the CDC serve s everyone  
regardless of insurance  type .  The CDC is also the natural link for healthcare education.  Maine DD Council 
fears that if the administration of this project is sh ifted this might be inter preted as  a change in the program s 
scope.   
 
In summary, this program is critical.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide input  and I am available for any 
questions.
