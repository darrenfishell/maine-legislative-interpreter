Testimony In Support of LD 231, ‘An Act to Support the Maine Pediatric and 
Behavioral Health Partnership Program’ 
Good Morning Senator, Baldacci and Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name is Dr. Deborah Hagler. l have practiced pediatrics for 26 years in Brunswick, Maine. lam the 
immediate past President of the Maine Chapter of The American Academy of Pediatrics, l reside in Harpswell, and l am 
testifying in favor of LD 231 An Act to support the Maine Pediatric and Behavioral Health Partnership Program. 
The typical day in pediatrics involves weaving in and out of exam rooms, managing asthma attacks, performing 
checkups, and evaluating rashes. However, now more than ever before, l'm seeing kids who don’t want to get out of bed 
and go to school. Some have a deep sense of hopelessness, who are expressing thoughts of death, and others are 
deeply fearful and worried about a whole host of things, to the point of having repeated panic attacks. Years ago, we 
could refer to a child and adolescent psychiatrist to manage these patients, but now, too many children are in need of 
these types of referrals, the urgency is too high, and the wait would be too long. 
General clinicians want to help but feel under-prepared by their training to manage these issues. Thankfully, because of 
the consult service provided by the Maine Pediatric and Behavioral Health partnership, I have been able to reach out by 
phone to a child and adolescent psychiatrist and get assistance for my patients. My psychiatry colleagues have promptly 
helped me initiate a host of therapies, guide patients to resources, and l have either continued to care for these patients 
and their families or begun medications as a bridge for youth with more complex mental illness until an appointment 
becomes available with a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Without the ability to promptly reach out for expert 
assistance, these children could have waited months or sat in an emergency room for weeks. As more colleagues 
around the stale have learned of this program, they have utilized the program and had similar experiences. 
Anyone who has had a child struggle with mental illness will tell you how challenging it is to get an appointment witha 
child and adolescent psychiatrist. This is not an issue unique to Maine - and now thanks to federal funding, most 
pediatricians around the country have access to some type of pediatric psychiatric consultative service. Some have had 
this access for years. 
LD 231 asks the Department of Health and Human services to preserve a critical program that gives general clinicians 
access to child and adolescent psychiatrists at a time when the global COVlD~19 pandemic has acted as an accelerant 
for mental health needs in youth. We are facing a shortage in Maine and nationally for the expertise of child behavioral 
health professionals. 
This legislation focuses on the Maine Pediatric and Behavioral Health Partnership providing consultation for primary care 
providers with child and adolescent psychiatrists. it offers a hotline, web portal or e-consult to work with child and 
adolescent psychiatrists at mutually convenient times for both parties involved. l'm not sure what you will hear from the 
department but they may raise this focus on the consultative process as a concern but this is a key component that 
directly helps patients and helps increase clinician knowledge. 
This legislation also calls for expansion and assessment of additional services. This language is purposely ﬂexible and 
allows for creative exploration of future needs such as use of groups to continue to address training gaps and case 
management services or the addition of specialists to manage adolescent substance use disorders or perinatal 
depression. There are a myriad of opportunities to learn from programs around the country. 
Evidence from studies following groups of people over long periods of time suggest that about half of the population will 
experience a diagnosable mental illness by midlife with most of these beginning in childhood and adolescence. ‘ When 
addressed early, the treatment is profound and can change the course of a life. Stigma, delayed recognition, and 
increasing workforce shortages lead to signiﬁcant delays in getting any kind of treatment; that is if treatment is sought at 
all. 
These iltnesses are costly to the individual and society and as we emerge from the pandemic we are facing an 
unprecedented number of children and adolescents in need of care. Child psychiatric consultative services provided 
through pediatric access programs are a critical piece of our workforce development. They allow for more children ’s 
needs to be met in the medical home allowing partners in psychiatry more time with severely ill patients. By providing 
care for the mental health of children this program is a much-needed investment in the future. The Maine Chapter 
American Academy of Pediatrics strongly encourages passage of LD231.
