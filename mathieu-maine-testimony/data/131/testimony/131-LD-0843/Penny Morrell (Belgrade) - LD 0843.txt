Sen. Grohoski, Rep. Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today.  I’m Penny Morrell, taxpayer and citizen of the 
Town of Belgrade, Maine.  
I oppose LDs 667 and 843, listed above.
Democrats are always on the side of raising taxes and explain it as helping the economy 
and low to middle income people.  Yet they know, or should know, from doing so for 
years, that it just isn’t true.  They spend on idiotic ideas and experiments knowing there is 
no bottom to the barrel.  They can tax us and spend our money without repercussions at 
the ballot box.
I trust that those days are coming to an end.  I am Republican.  We believe that the 
money workers earn belongs to them, not the government.  We are for smaller 
government and letting the private sector go to work to supply services.  As President 
Ronald Reagan said, “The most nine terrifying words are: ‘I’m from the government and 
I’m here to help.”
We suggest this committee find ways to cut spending especially in Education and DHHS.  
Those two departments have the highest budgets and there is much waste and fraud.  It 
is hypocritical for Democrats to target an income bracket to tax higher.  That’s bigotry 
that they claim to oppose.  Education, hard work, experience, and many other factors go 
into how much a wage earner is paid.  No one should be punished for achieving the 
American dream.  Not in the America and State of Maine I live in.
I urge this committee to vote “ought not to pass” on LDs 667 and 843.  Thank you.
