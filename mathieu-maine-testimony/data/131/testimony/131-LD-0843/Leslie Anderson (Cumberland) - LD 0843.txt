LD 843
I am writing today in Opposition to LD 843.  Living in Cumberland, Maine is 
extremely expensive and increasing the tax rate to 11.15% is not tenable even with a 
single paycheck over 200K.  My son is a senior this year and I am looking at 
extremely high college tuition on the horizon.  I don't see how we can afford to pay 
for new taxes when the cost of living is so high.  You are penalizing the same people 
who have not received any of the Governor's tax rebate checks during the pandemic 
and asking us to pay more money.  My electric bill is sky high with all your other 
policies and I think I will have to move out of Maine and move to NH if this bill 
passes so I can spend my tax state income dollars on college tuition instead of funding
larger state government.  Please vote against LD 843!
