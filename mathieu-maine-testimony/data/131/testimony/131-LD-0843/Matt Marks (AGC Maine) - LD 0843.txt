 RE: AGC Maine’s Opposition to LD 8 43 “An Act to Improve Income Tax Progressivity by Establishing a 
New Top Individual Income Tax Rate ” 
 Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry , and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation  my name  is Matthew Marks,  I am a Principal at Cornerstone  Government  Affairs,  and sending 
this on behalf  of my client  The Associated  General Contractors  of Maine.  AGC  Maine  is a statewide  
commercial construction  trade  association  and a Chapter of AGC  America which  was founded  in 1918  
with 27,000  contractors,  suppliers,  and service  providers  nationwide .  
 
Adjusting the top tier of the income  tax rate to 11.15%  would  place  Maine  second  in the country  for the 
top marginal tax rates . This bill follows  a similar model  to California,  where  they  have  a 13% income  tax 
rate and one of the lowest  rates  at the bottom  tier. Whether  you believe  the tax rate is a contrib uting 
factor  or not to the outmigration  of residents  in California,  the data  suggests  the income  tax rate may  be 
a consideration.   
 
 

188 Whitten Road, Augusta ME 04330  www.agcmaine.org   207- 622- 4741 Following  the COVID  Pandemic,  Maine ’s businesses  have  continued  to adjust  to the market.  According 
to Maine ’s Small  Business Development  Centers1 survey  in conjunction  with  the University  of Southern  
Maine  approximately 55% of small businesses in Maine had to close during COVI D and most  small 
businesses experienced a reduction in monthly revenue, averaging a 36% decrease . Approximately 45% 
of respondents and 57% of sole proprietors had to forgo  their own salaries  to keep their businesses  
afloat . Additionally,  many  corporations  in Maine  are pass -through  entities,  where  the owner  will have  
reduced  capital  and certainly  a competitive  disad vantage  to businesses  in our region.  Maine  ranked  10th 
in 20192 for the highest  tax rate on pass -through  entities.   
 
Additionally,  Maine ’s budget surplus  is a clear  indication  that this shift  is not necessary.  Maine  should  
encourage  the continued  migration  of highly  skilled , highly  trained , and well- compensated  workers.  The 
investment in both  new  homes,  new  businesses , and investment elevates  the market and provides  
opportunities  for growth.  I encourage  the Committee to vote  against  LD 843.  
 
Sincerely,
