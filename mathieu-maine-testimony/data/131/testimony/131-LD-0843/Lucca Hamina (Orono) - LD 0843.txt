Lucca Hamina
Orono
LD 843
Senator Grohski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation: my name is Lucca Hamina, I am a resident of Orono and I 
am here to testify in favor of LD 843 and LD 667. Currently, the main tax code treats 
middle-class citizens and the States highest earners the same in our tax code, but it 
has not always been this way. During former Governor LePage’s administration, 
Maine saw tax cuts on the wealthiest in the State which have since led to a tax 
revenue loss of an estimated 400 million dollars every year.  This loss in tax revenue 
has been reflected in less funding for education and local services according to 
Mainers for Tax Fairness. LD 843 and LD 667 would help to repair this loss in 
revenue and help out all Mainers by taxing those that have the ability to pay for it. As 
someone who has come from a wealthy family, my experiences growing up reflected 
just this. My family would often lament tax increases, but never did it affect our 
quality of life. We were never forced to miss groceries for a week, worry about 
paying rent or mortgage, or have to choose between getting gas or having a meal due 
to taxes during years with poor economic conditions. Even during the pandemic, 
which hit many middle and working-class Mainers extremely hard, my family didn’t 
have to sacrifice a comfortable lifestyle. The bottom line of what I am trying to say is 
that high-income earners have the ability to pay these taxes and give back to the State 
and Community they live in, helping provide services that help all of us. These bills 
are chances to get Maine back on track to a thriving State by providing funds that can 
be reinvested into education, critical care services, and the physical and mental health 
needs of Mainers. I would like to end this testimony by thanking the members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Taxation for their time and urging all of them to support
LDs 843 and 667.
