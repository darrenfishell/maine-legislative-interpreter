Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Taxation.
My
name
is
Steven
Santiago,
and
I
am
a
student
activist
at
UMaine
and
a
Mainer
at
heart.
I’m
a
resident
of
Orono
and
I
am
writing
to
testify
in
favor
of
LD
843
and
LD
667.
Increasing
taxes
on
high
incomes
is
the
best
way
to
raise
needed
revenue
without
adding
more
hardship
to
working
class
families.
American
liberties
and
ideals
are
in
my
blood.
We’re
a
country
thought
to
be
fair,
just,
and
equal.
However,
in
recent
years
we
have
learned
this
is
not
necessarily
always
the
case.
The
wealthy
have
more
power
than
working
class
families
in
the
American
political
system.
This
unfair
distribution
of
power
is
one
way
that
American
families
experience
expounded
grief.
Taxation
is
one
lever
we
can
use
to
promote
the
American
values
of
fairness,
justice,
and
equality.
We
must
tax
the
wealthy.
We
can
use
this
money
to
fund
our
social
safety
net.
Social
work
is
in
crisis
with
the
need
that
is
being
expressed
by
American
families.
Social
Workers
can
hardly
keep
up
with
demand.
They
just
don’t
have
the
resources.
If
we
take
back
the
resources
hoarded
by
the
top
earners,
we
can
create
a
social
environment
in
which
all
thrive,
not
just
the
privileged
and
fortunate.
Working
class
families
experience
hardship
enough
as
is.
They
hold
up
our
economy
through
our
current
sales
tax.
We
can
relieve
the
burden
on
those
who
make
our
economy
function
if
we
tax
the
wealthy.
Our
working
families
make
up
the
core
of
who
we
are
as
Mainers.
Isn’t
it
right
if
we
do
them
justice?
My
family
is
one
that
suffers.
My
mom
is
a
high
earner
but
my
dad
is
medically
retired.
This
unbalancing
is
one
that
makes
it
difficult
to
pay
the
bills
and
make
sure
we
have
enough
to
get
by.
These
taxes,
with
the
assumption
that
revenue
gained
goes
to
social
services,
would
help
my
family
get
by.
It
would
help
many
Maine
families
get
by.
By
taxing
the
wealthy,
we
can
create
a
society
that
is
fair,
just,
and
equitable.
Thank
you,
Steven
Santiago
