Lewiston
LD 843
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Taxation: my name is Jim Lysen, I am a resident of Lewiston and I am 
here today to testify in favor of LD 843 and LD 667. 
Increasing taxes on high incomes is the best way to raise the revenue we need without
negatively affecting  low-and moderate-income families.  Working Mainers are 
experiencing real hardships. Many in my community face poor health, 
unemployment, hunger, housing insecurity, especially seniors and veterans. We must 
begin to meet their needs! 
Rolling back LePage-era tax cuts for the wealthy will make our tax code more fair, 
and provide  resources necessary to start regaining ground after years of underfunding
for Maine communities, including Lewiston. 
We need to have tax fainess to accomplish the things that Mainer's need. 
Thank you for the time to testify!
