Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation:my name is Adam Zuckerman and I am the lobbyist for the 
Maine People’s Alliance. Our 32,000 members are committed to creating a state of 
Maine where everyone has what they need, everyone contributes what they can, and no 
one is left behind.
That is why I am here to testify today in opposition to LDs 835 and 971 and in favor of  
LDs 843 and LD 667.
We pay for things that benefit all of us–like roads, public safety, libraries, parks, and 
clean water–by coming together and using our tax dollars. The revenue we raise 
through taxes allows us to make sure that all of our families and communities have what 
they need and no one falls through the cracks. That’s the social contract we share as 
Mainers.
Cutting or eliminating taxes threatens our ability to uphold those commitments to Maine 
people and communities now and to future generations.Former Gov. LePage spent 
years deliberately dismantling Maine’s social safety net1 while passing tax cuts for the 
wealthy that slowed our economic recovery2 and to this day still cost our state nearly a 
billion dollars every year.3 These proposals would double down on that failed strategy, 
which would bring further cuts to crucial programs.  
Instead, we can shore up our fiscal stability by creating a fairer tax system. Between 
1973 and 2015 the wealthiest Mainers captured 42 percent of the state’s income growth 
— an eightfold increase in accumulation over the previous generation.4 However, they 
pay the same tax rate as middle-income workers earning just over $50,000 a year. 
That’s not right.

LDs 843 and 667 would correct that injustice. Representative Osher’s LD 843 
establishes a new income bracket for single filers making over $125,000 and joint filers 
making over $250,000. Representative. Ben Collings’ LD 667 is a millionaires’ tax, 
establishing 3% surcharge on taxable income in excess of $1,000,000 and 6% on 
taxable income in excess of $10,000,000. 
Both would generate sustainable ongoing revenue to shore our state against a possible 
upcoming recession. They will also make our tax code more fair and will help reinvest in 
our communities after years of underfunding.
I urge you to oppose LDs 835 and 971 and support LDs 843 and LD 667. Thank you.
