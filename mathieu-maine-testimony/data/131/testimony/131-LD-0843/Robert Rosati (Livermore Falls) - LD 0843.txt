LD 843
Dear Taxation Committee, we beseech you vote against LD 843 regarding a tax 
increase on hard working Maine citizens. We do not want our hard earned tax dollars 
going to globalist agendas such as Social,Emotional, Race and Gender. We also do 
not want our tax money utilized to support illegal persons sent to our state w/o we the 
citizens knowledge or input. Fuel,groceries and electricity are already taxing us more 
than enough. Vote no on LD 843, we pray. Thank you.
