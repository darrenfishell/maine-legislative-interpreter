I am writing in support of raising the Maine income taxes paid by the wealthiest Mainers, either 
through Rep. Osher’s LD 843, which would create a higher income tax bracket for those who 
earn more than middle-class incomes, or through Rep. Collings’ LD 667, which would do the 
same thing in effect by levying an income tax surcharge on those who earn more than middle-
class incomes.
I support either of these bills because the State of Maine needs additional resources to help 
everyone else.  It needs additional resources to support our public schools, which are right now 
being forced to lay off great numbers of teachers whom we desperately need to teach our 
children. The State needs additional resources to address our crisis in affordable housing, our 
crisis in substance abuse, and so many other problems.
Where can these resources come from?  Poor and middle-class Mainers are struggling to make 
ends meet; they can’t pay more taxes.  The resources have to come from those who are not 
feeling pinched by inflation and who without intending it are driving up the cost of housing for 
everyone else.  The two bills under consideration here restore something like the traditional 
state income tax levels that were eliminated a decade ago, before conditions worsened for the 
majority of Mainers, and they draw resources from the Mainers who can afford to contribute 
them.
