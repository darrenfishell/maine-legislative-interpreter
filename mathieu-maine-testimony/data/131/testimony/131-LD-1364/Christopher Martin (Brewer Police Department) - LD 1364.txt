 Written Testimony on 
L.D. 1364 “An Act to Prevent Opioid Overdose Deaths  by Establishing Safe 
Consumption Sites” 
Presented by 
Deputy Chief Christopher M. Martin 
Brewer Police Department 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
April 27, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representativ e Salisbury, and 
distinguished members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
 
I am submitting testimony in opposition of the pass age of LD 1364, “An Act to 
Prevent Opioid Overdose Deaths by Establishing Safe  Consumption Sites”.  I 
have also submitted testimony in opposition to a si milar bill, LD 1159,” An Act to 
Establish a Pilot Project Regarding Harm Reduction Centers”, being considered 
by the Committee on Health and Human Services.  
Supervised injection sites do little to reduce the overall demand for illicit drugs. 
Since 2019, there has been a concerted effort to de criminalize the possession of 
illicit drugs. The Maine Center for Sensible Drug C ontrol Policy released a report 
outlining legislative priorities in 2019, and since  that time nearly all of the social 
justice reform measures have been introduced as leg islation.  Safe injection sites 
were one of those priorities in an effort to move t owards the broader objective 
of the decriminalization of drug possession. 
In order for the concept of a safe injection site t o be functional there must be a 
zone around the site that would allow for “de facto  decriminalization” allowing 
consumers to safely transport their drugs to and fr om the site without interdiction 
by law enforcement.  The first time this was introd uced in Maine as proposed 
legislation would have created a ½ mile radius allo wing for use and possession 
and deterring law enforcement from enforcing laws r egarding the same (LD 
949, “An Act to Prevent Overdose Deaths”, 129 th  Maine Legislature, 2019). 
Vancouver’s Insite, North America’s oldest and firs t established safe injection 
site, is often used as the gold standard model.  I would strongly recommend that 
people should first tour Insite and the surrounding  area before considering using 
this model. 
2 
 A deeper look at the impact of Insite in relation t o effectiveness, ability to 
reduce the demand for illicit drugs, the effects on  businesses and residents in the 
area immediately surrounding Insite, and crime reve als the following: 
 Safe injection sites are good at what they do, whic h is really one thing, 
prevent people from dying inside the facility. 
 It didn’t reduce the overall demand for illicit dru gs. 
 No reduction in crime. 
 Overall degradation of area surrounding Insite. 
 Drugs were obtained on the black market, making thi s area a vibrant 
market for drug suppliers. 
 Crimes committed to facilitate addiction impacted s urrounding areas. 
 Most addicted persons that used the supervised inje ction site still used 
drugs primarily outside of the site on the streets,  using drugs when it was a 
matter of convenience and compulsion. 
 Created a de facto decriminalization zone for drug possession, which in 
turn created a low risk / high reward area for traf fickers. 
 Didn’t lead to healthy neighborhoods or people. 
 Community safety issues ignored over the desire to provide safe drug use, 
a resulting public apathy and feeling of helplessne ss contributing to 
unreported crimes and victimization. 
 Limited data involved whether HIV/AIDS cases droppe d due to safe 
injection sites. 
 Slim evidence to show a reduction in overall addict ion rates, marginal at 
best, detoxification success rate very low (less th an 2%). 
 Very little collection of data that could demonstra te lasting benefits. 
  
Attached to this testimony is a position paper by O ntario’s police leaders, 
“Supervised Injection Sites”, that contains referen ce materials relating to this.  I 
have also included hardcopies of news stories from resource links below.  Within 
the resource links you will see videos that explore  the immediate area around 
Insite’s location in Vancouver. 
As we struggle with finding workable solutions to c ombating our drug epidemic 
we must recognize that we have to consider the illi cit drug economy and then 
employ models to influence behaviors regarding supp ly and demand, making 
investments in the realms of: enforcement, educatio n, access to treatment, and 
sustainable recovery.  It is through a balanced pra gmatic approach that we 
can have a functional drug control strategy.  Strat egies that indoctrinate 
permissiveness removes consequences and the impetus  to change, an all carrot 
and no stick approach, which is detrimental to all involved. 
3 
 We must recognize that illicit drug consumption is a money-making venture, one 
that organized crime is the profiteer.  The Mexican  Cartels control every major 
distribution hub in the United States with no other  criminal organization posed to 
challenge their dominance.  All of the fentanyl, me thamphetamine, and 
cocaine that we have here in our state came from th e distribution of the 
Mexican Cartels, which has an identified presence i n New England states.  From 
there it goes to other levels of organized crime, g angs, and is further distributed 
at the street level.   
We are seeing wholesale quantity seizures of fentan yl and methamphetamine 
by patrol officers in my area.  Pounds and kilogram s are readily available, this is 
a significant change from years past. 
Our demand is at an all time high, as illustrated b y record numbers of overdoses 
and overdose deaths.   
Supply sources, gangs, are now coming to my area to  distribute drugs to meet 
the demand.  A stark contrast from years past when our consumers travelled to 
Massachusetts to procure drugs for use and sale.  T hese gang members come 
from New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.  Gun  involvements and 
violence are becoming more common place.  The under lying reason is because 
its about money, making money.  Criminal organizati ons profit while our citizenry 
is at risk. 
In closing, I implore you to consider what the like ly results will be if we proceed 
towards safe injection sites and the decriminalizat ion of drug possession.  We 
can learn much from Vancouver, and predictable is p reventable.

LEVY: My tour of Vancouver's depressing,
horrifying Downtown Eastside

Could this be what we call hell on earth?
That s all I could think of as I visited Vancouver's now infamous Downtown
Eastside twice last weekend — the first time on a rainy afternoon and
subsequently on the one afternoon during my stay when the sun came out.
Where do I begin?
Imagine drug addicts clustered together on the sidewalk under make-shift
lean-tos oftarps and rope surrounded by filth, empty food containers,
clothes, shoes, garbage bags and bottles.
Cast your mind's eye to rail-thin emaciated female drug addicts shuffling
along East Hastings St. with nowhere really to go, an elderly Asian man
dumpster diving (for what I don't know) and dozens of drugged out people
sitting on the sidewalk or cartons staring into space.

Think of trying to manoeuvre public sidewalks that have been taken over
pretty much entirely for blocks by those makeshift lean-tos, scores of bikes,
walkers, wheelchairs, wagons, shopping carts and of course the addicts.
As you pass, you observe one man standing in a drug-induced pose and
several others shooting up with impunity in broad daylight.
The stench of urine, feces and pot is everywhere and at certain points along
the street on the sunny afternoon, goods (perhaps stolen?) for sale were
laid out on blankets.
This continued for blocks and blocks — the area growing sketchier the more
I moved away from the comer where West Hastings turned into East
Hastings.

It was like watching a horrifying multi-vehicle accident. I wanted to unsee
the decay and the mass ofzombie-like drugged out people clustered
together. But I couldn't take my eyes off this Apocalyptic scene.
I later told a colleague that it reminded me of a third-world country, as bad
as the slums of Soweto in South Africa I visited 20 years ago.
It was hard to believe that a mere 20-minute walk away from this hellish
site lay Canada Place, Vancouver's seaport and the tony Coal Harbour area.
But this is proof of the harm of safe injection sites, a permissive out-of-
control drug culture, politicians who have let the problem escalate and social
justice do-gooders who are doing more harm than good.
I wanted very much to see for myself what has happened to the Downtown
East side since InSite opened its first safe injection site in 2002.

Just prior to 2017 in Toronto — when the board of health and its chairman
Joe Cressy did a sales job for the same permissive model here — a woman
came to council from Vancouver to warn that the area was becoming a
Dante's Inferno.
I spoke to police officials in Vancouver at the time who contended that
without enforcement and mandatory rehab, the SIS model wouldn't work.
That was seven years ago. Vancouver's East Side has turned into a horror
show and even the streets surrounding it as far as Gastown have a sketchy
feel.

In November of 2017 Cressy gleefully announced that the federal
government had approved three safe injection sites for Toronto — insisting
repeatedly the sites save lives.
Now Cressy has left his Councillor job and left the mess to others, as has
Mike Layton and Kristyn Wong-Tam, all of whom pushed for the drug
enabling sites.
That has grown in five years to nine supervised consumption sites and a
variety of others located in hotel shelters under a program called I-Phare
(Integrated Prevention and Harm Reduction Initiative) — a kind of one -stop
shopping for drug addicts.
There's no doubt these initiatives have attracted drug dealers and crime to
the neighbourhoods where they are located.
Because they are more spread out than Vancouver, the addicts aren't
camped on the sidewalks of several blocks of East Hastings.
At least not yet.
But they certainly have wreaked havoc on the neighbourhoods where they
are located.
Take the Bond Hotel shelter on Dundas St E., where I shot a video a few
weeks ago while dealers plied their trade right behind me and zombie
addicts occupied the sidewalk outside the shelter.
I spent considerable time outside the Street Health safe injection site, also
on Dundas St. E., and The Works on Victoria St., both of which have
severely changed the characteristics of the neighbourhoods they are in.
Dirty needles, crime, transients hanging out outside both sites and an
increasingly sketchy vibe at Yonge-Dundas square and in Cabbagetown
where hookers trade sex for drugs has been the norm.
Mayor John Tory and councillors have turned a blind eye to the increasing
crime and refuse to connect the dots that lawlessness is on the increase
because of these drug enabling philosophies.
The few Vancouverites who dared to speak up about InSite and Vancouver
Coastal Health— which runs the safe injection programs —cited stats that
deaths from overdoses have actually increased since 2002 and that a mere
3% of InSite users are referred for rehab.
They were loudly attacked by the harm reduction activists.
Now five years later, Vancouver's East Side is a depressing and horrifying
mess — one that will take extreme political will to ignore the noise of the
activists and to clean it up.
It should certainly be a wake-up call for Toronto's politicians.
If they think it can't happen here, they're sadly misinformed.

On Tuesday, Gunn told Daily Hive Urbanized his team's work on the documentary first
began in March 2022, and it was originally planned as a shorter, 25-minute video with a
June or July release. But it was pushed back and expanded, as their interviews and
research demanded a longer, more in-depth piece.
"Growing up in BC, it seemed to me that over the past 20 years governments, of all
political stripes, have been doubling down on the same failed suite of policies despite the
fact they continue to produce worse and worse results," said Gunn.

One of his many interviews was with Marshall Smith, who is the chief of staff of new
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. Up until this month, for three years, Smith was the chief
of staff for the Alberta Minister of Mental Health and Addiction.
In the early 2010s, while working as a ministerial assistant for the BC provincial
government in Vancouver, Smith fell into an alcoholism addiction and spent over five years
homeless in the streets of the city.
"What helped me was getting to treatment. I got into recovery. My life has been good
because of that. That's my story," said Smith, who had been working in Alberta's

Smith pointed to government statistics that show 90% of the issues deal with drugs and
addiction, 70% of overdoses happen when people are alone at home, and 50% of
suspected deaths from overdose in the city occurred inside SROs and other supportive
housing.

"People are not living in tents on the Downtown Eastside because they can't afford rent,
they're doing that because they're severely addicted to heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
People are not living under overpasses because they don't have an opportunity to get an
apartment, they are there because they suffer from significant mental health and
addiction issues. Yes, they're homeless, but there's a reason why, so we need to make sure
we're attempting to solve the right problem," said Smith.
"As a person with an addiction, the worst thing you can do for me is to give me four walls
and a door that I can lock. You will quite likely find me dead on the living room floor at
some point because we know that 70% of fatal overdoses happen at home alone.

of the unsupportive and permissive environment he found himself in.

"I arrived there and they took me upstairs, and as I was passing an office heading into my
room, they basically had offered me meth pipes, crack pipes, needles, and sent me off to
my room, which at the time I turned down," said Hall.
"But approximately 10 minutes after I got into my room, I had a knock on my door and it
was the person across the hall from me offering me a free sample of heroin. So, I relapsed
that night and was living there for I think approximately a year. And I'm in a situation
where there is a drug dealer across the hall from me, and down the hall from me. So, I'm
thinking, I'm gonna end up dying in this situation."

The documentary also interviewed Arezo Zarrabian, a Vancouver Police Department
crime analyst who is running for Vancouver City Council with the Non-Partisan
Association (NPA).
"What used to be normal in the Downtown Eastside, which I'm not saying is right, has now
transferred to Kitsilano, downtown, and Mount Pleasant areas. There are four random
attacks a day, and your likelihood of being a victim of a random assault is one in four if you
are a Vancouver resident. And that's for reported crime... If someone looks at you the
wrong way, you shouldn't look back or you shouldn't say something back, because you
don't know what may happen," she said.

A sense of lawlessness on the streets of downtown Vancouver is being made worse by federal policy to
avoid remanding repeat and violent offenders, a Conversations That Matter panel of experts heard on
Tuesday night.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
The panel on rising street crime, a Conversations Live event hosted by Stuart McNish, was held a week
after municipal elections in which concern over random violence and street crime was a major issue, and
the day Premier-in-waiting David Eby said that crime and public safety was one of the big issues in the
province.

The six-person panel included JJ Bean founder John Neate, Doug LePard and Amanda Butler — co-
authors of the recently released Repeat Offenders report for the B.C. government — Vancouver Police
Department deputy chief Steve Rai, National Police Federation president Brian Sauve and Surrey Board
of Trade president Anita Huberman. Veteran Vancouver Sun cime reporter Kim Bolan and columnist
Dan Fumano were also part of the conversation.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Neate said that while he understood that many of the repeat offenders who have terrorized his staff have
major mental health and housing problems, therewas no accountability.
He said in one case a man walked into a JJ Bean coffee shop on Main Street and when he was told he
could not use the toilet without being a customer, he defecated on the floor. This came after a store
washroom was destroyed by a person who was not a customer.
"He said 'you won't let me use the washroom, well here you go, here's a gift for you.' It makes it an
unpleasant place to work," Neate said.

More serious incidents include cases of smashed windows and the same people coming in to JJ Bean
stores in an attempt to steal or ask customers for money. His stores had been broken into three times
over the past month.

Neate said he had been active in the downtown core since 1979 and his sense was that it had become
"lawless."
"There's a real sense of impunity," he said.
LePard said that in 2019 there were 15,000 people in B.C. prisons, while in 2022 that number had fallen
to 9,000.
He said this was because judges wanted to keep people out of jail during COVID-19, while the federal
government s Bill €75 bail reform legislation was leading to more people being released on bail.
Many retailers report people with no-go orders just coming back in over and over again. We see this
sense of emboldenment, that I won't be held in jail so I can do what I want," LePard said,
In other provinces remand has gone back to pre-pandemic levels. Are judges different here? Are Crown
not asking for remand? Arrest and jail is not the solution, but it's part of the solution."

Bolan pointed out that people involved in more serious crimes than were occurring in the Downtown
Eastside were also being released on bail. She said that policing still had to focus on gang crime, which is
as tragic as anything happening on the Downtown Eastside, and linked because low-level gang members
dealt drugs in the area and often attacked drug buyers.
Rai said that Vancouver was a safe city, but there was a perception of rampant crime that was leading to
fear and people not wanting to come to downtown Vancouver.
"To get away from lawlessness we have to get back to core policing," he said, adding that police were
having to act as medical responders in many cases. He said there were cracks in all parts of the system
around policing — from training, to dispatch to health care.

All participants agreed that policing was being made more difficult by the lack of adequate housing and
health services for many of the repeat offenders.
Butler thought that Canada and B.C. needed to look at models of incarceration that focused on health.
She said that a "low-secure" facility should be built — not like the 1960$ asylum model — for people who
have complex disorders and are involved with the criminal justice system.
"Prisons are not places of healing," Butler said.
Sauve said that all levels of government needed to have a discussion about "what we want the police to
do."
Huberman said businesses in Surrey were tired of the politicization of policing in their city.

The Harm in "Harm Reduction"
Vancouver's experiment with safe-injection sites is a dead end for addicts—and a public-health
risk.
/ From the Magazine / The Social Order, Public Safety Spring 2020
1 very major city in the United States seems to have its designated opioid district, a tucked-away part of
town where normal rules are suspended and the drug trade shapes the social order: Kensington in
Philadelphia, the Tenderloin in San Francisco, Pioneer Square in Seattle. The scenes are sadly familiar:
disheveled men and women living under blue tarpaulins, dealers doing hand-to-hand transactions between
large trash receptacles, and dope fiends searching with their fingertips for the last good vein. Methadone
clinics and rescue missions operate amid a steady rumble of ambulances and police cruisers, vehicles sent
not to enforce public order but to manage the status quo.
Political leaders have long sought to transform these places. Among progressive policymakers, the
prevailing trend is "harm reduction," a public-health approach that accepts widespread drug use and directs
resources toward mitigating its negative consequences. Harm reduction began with needle exchange and
methadone clinics, which helped, respectively, to reduce the transmission of blood-borne diseases and to
stabilize addicts with opioid replacements. Now, as Western nations confront the opioid crisis, cities in
Canada, Australia, and Europe have adopted a new harm-reduction strategy: so-called safe-injection sites,
where addicts can take drugs—predominantly heroin and methamphetamine—under the supervision of
medical professionals, who intervene in case of emergency.
Public-health officials and progressive leaders often cite Vancouver, Canada, as the gold standard of harm
reduction. Over the past 30 years, Vancouver has implemented the full range ofharm-reduction strategies.
The centerpiece of the city's current efforts is the Insite safe-injection facility on East Hastings Street, which
has drawn the attention of academics and media from around the world. Advocates argue that such
facilities can prevent fatal overdoses, reduce rates of infection, connect addicts to social services, and
mitigate street disorder, with few negative consequences.
What's happening in Vancouver can hardly be categorized as a success, however. Though harm reduction
has brought some benefits, such as reducing the transmission ofHIV, it has also compounded the
problems of addiction, homelessness, and public disorder. Vancouver's concentration of services in its own
opioid district, the Downtown Eastside, has created a veritable death trap for addicts around British
Columbia, who travel there to obtain drugs, overdose, and then perish in the streets.
As cities in the United States, including San Francisco, Denver, Philadelphia, and Seattle, consider opening
their own safe-injection sites, they should understand the full consequences of these practices. Beneath the
narrow certainties of the academic literature runs a deeper story that reveals the hidden costs of harm
reduction. As the coronavirus begins to spread in opioid districts throughout North America, policymakers
must reconsider the wisdom of concentrating vulnerable, immunocompromised populations in tight
quarters, where they can become vectors for a catastrophic outbreak.
'n the surface, Vancouver is an unlikely location for an opioid epidemic. In popular imagination, the
crisis is taking place in impoverished inner-city slums or forgotten rural communities. According to the
influential "deatl'is of despair" Iiypothesis, the opioid crisis is most pronounced in communities exposed to
"prolonged economic distress," leading to a decline in life expectancy for middle-aged men. But Vancouver
is neither West Baltimore nor West Virginia—it's one of the world's most prosperous and progressive cities,
with a booming economy, liberal leadership, and universal health care. And yet, despite this affluence, the
city faces one of the worst drug problems on record. Since 2008, overdose deaths in British Columbia are
up 151 percent, with Vancouver's numbers driving much of the increase. According to CTV News,
Vancouver's "paramedics and dispatchers are feeling fatigued and burnt out" by the pace ofopioid
overdoses, "and some are experiencing occupational stress injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder."
The Downtown Eastside neighborhood is ground zero for the troubles. For the past century, the area has
been Vancouver's Skid Row, home to a dense network of cheap hotels, bars, brothels, and, increasingly,
homeless encampments and social-services offices. It's here, across ten city blocks, that Vancouver has
launched its experiment in harm reduction, opening Canada's first needle exchange in 1988 and North
America's first safe-injection facility in 2003. Rather than try to disperse the Downtown Eastside's social
pathologies throughout the region, policymakers have decided to concentrate new subsidized housing
construction, welfare services, and drug programs in the neighborhood. Total social spending in the
Downtown Eastside now amounts to more than $1 million per day.
Despite these intensive efforts, the city has failed meaningfully to reduce rates of addiction, homelessness,
and criminality in the neighborhood, which remains the epicenter for all overdose deaths in the region. In
2017, the City of Vancouver logged 8,000 overdose calls, with the Downtown Eastside responsible for 5,000
of the total, even with a population of only a few thousand residents. The situation has become ever more
chaotic, as Covid-19 threatens to spread among many homeless men and women who have nowhere else to
go.
For the addicts caught up in the Downtown Eastside's web of social programs, the results are not
encouraging. According to a ten-year long! iLidinal study by Simon Fraser University professor Julian
Somers, even the most service-intensive interventions failed to produce better outcomes. In his study of
433 addicts enrolled in Vancouver at Home, a program oflfering free housing and comprehensive services,
Somers concluded that "despite the high concentration of services and supports in the [Downtown
Eastside], members of the current sample experienced significant personal decline rather than recovery, as
evidenced by their involvements with criminal justice, large increases in acute care and prolonged
homelessness." Over ten years, Somers writes, "participants' use of community medical services and hospital
services each tripled, while criminal convictions and welfare receipt doubled."
"According to the latest numbers, more than 1,500
overdoses a year have taken place within a block of the
Insite facility"
Even the key claim ofharm-reduction advocates—that safe-injection sites reduce overdose deaths—loses
much of its rhetorical power when viewed in context. While it's true that Insite recorded 189,837 visits last
year without any fatalities on the premises, the Downtown Eastside streets saw more overdose deaths than
ever. It's not that addicts who use the safe-injection site are achieving sobriety; they're just not dying on the
floor of the Insite injection room. According to the latest numbers, more than 1,500 overdoses a year have
taken place within a block of the Insite facility in the Downtown Eastside. And even the "no deaths on the
premises" statistic might be misleading. As a secret recording from the Powell Street Getaway facility
reveals, it's possible for addicts to overdose at safe-injection sites, and then die en route to the hospital or
after they have returned to the streets.
More broadly, if the objective is to maximize overdose reversals, safe-injection sites may not be the most
efficient method of achieving this goal. According to the BC Centre for Disease Control, British Columbia
ciirrently sees between 1,000 and 2,000 overdose reversals per month. These are primarily administered in
the field by paramedics, law enforcement, community members, and other drug users. The government's
decentralized Take Home Naloxone and Facility Overdose Response programs, which distribute overdose-
reversal kits into the community, cover a much broader territory and deliver much greater results than
brick-and-mortar safe-injection sites, with less potential for negative spillover effects.
Finally, even if one accepts the purported benefits ofsafe-injection sites, the solution cannot scale to serve
the addict population in the Downtown Eastside. The Insite facility has a $3 million annual budget, 12-seat
injection room, and averages 700 to 800 visits per day—but according to the latest data, these figures
represent only 4 percent of the total number of daily injections in the Downtown Eastside. In other words,
ifpolicymakers were to scale safe-injection sites to meet the overall rate of neighborhood drug
consumption, they would need to build 25 more facilities in the Downtown Eastside alone—a political,
financial, and spatial impossibility.
ie Downtown Eastside is one of the world's most heavily studied neighborhoods. A cursory glance
through the academic literature reveals at least 6,500 peer-reviewed papers, journal articles, and scientific
reports that focus on life there. According to the National Post, the neighborhood is home to "more than
170 nonprofits clustered in an area of only a few blocks, all devoted towards supporting an increasingly
dense community of addicts." An entire social-scientific sector is devoted to solving the problems of the
Downtown Eastside, to little avail.
Indeed, these efforts have contributed to a "magnet effect" that encourages opioid addicts from around
British Columbia to move into the neighborhood in search of social programs, a permissive social
environment, and easy access to drugs. According to the Simon Fraser University study, from 2005 to 2015,
the number of homeless addicts who had migrated to the Downtown Eastside from outside the
neighborhood increased from 17 percent to 52 percent of the overall population. In the name of
compassion, public officials have created perverse incentives that are worsening homelessness, overdoses,
and crime.
As it turns out, much of the academic literature in support of the current harm-reduction policy is more
about activism than hard science. According to a recent survey by the RAND Corporation, nearly 80
percent of the literature on safe-injection sites is made up of studies from just two facilities: Insite in
Vancouver and the Medically Supervised Injection Centre, in Sydney, Australia. As the RAND scholars
conclude, these studies are neither rigorous nor definitive, and they often ignore the potential for
community-level harm and second-order effects. "We conducted our own assessment of the individual
studies," the report argues, "and found that the evidence base concerning the overall effects ofSCSs
[supervised consumption sites] is limited in quality and location."
Even worse, as a recent investigation by the Huffington Post revealed, one activist-researcher who had
lobbied for the original funding for Insite coauthored all 33 studies of the facility from 2003 to 2009.
Unsurprisingly, they showed unanimously positive results. Some of these studies were even produced in
collaboration with the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users, an activist group that requires researchers
to agree to their niles, including: "if researchers want to work with us they should really become allies of
our movement," "we want to see the research—in progress—to give feedback," and "[researchers must]
present us with an explanation and action plan on how the research will contribute to the empowerment
and liberation of people who use drugs." This is the language of radicalism, not science, and any study
conducted under such auspices should be treated with skepticism.

ion advocates have positioned themselves as the arbiters of a morally neutral, scientific
objectivity, dismissing dissenters as "deniers." But the advocates have constructed their argument on the
moral foundation of "harm reduction," which cannot be evaluated simply as a neutral science. Though it
has proved a valuable tool in some cases—for example, preventing infections and reversing overdoses—
harm reduction makes profound assumptions about human nature that must be subjected to a broader
public debate.
The critical question facing neighborhoods like the Downtown Eastside is: What is the desired end? Mark
Tyndall, a physician and leading harm-reduction advocate in Vancouver, believes that the goal of sobriety
—the traditional telos of both medicine and public policy, when it comes to drug abuse—is outdated and
should be abandoned. The real objective, he argues, should not be recovery from addiction but the
maintenance of addiction, possibly in perpetuity. "People have these unrealistic expectations like ... we
need to get [safe-injection users] abstinent and recovered," Tyndall explains. "That so rarely happens to
people that I don't have those expectations anymore. I want to keep people alive and relatively healthy
and hope for the best."
The flaw ofharm-reduction theory is that it contains no natural limits. Convinced that safe-injection sites
are insufficient, Tyndall and his colleagues at the BC Centre for Disease Control are launching a pilot
program to provide addicts with a "clean supply" ofopioids through "ATM-style machines—with biometric
scanners, real-time monitoring and alarm systems—that would distribute the pills to patients." The
Vancouver Mayor's Overdose Emergency Task Force has endorsed the plan, recommending that the city
"prioritize and identify space for a suitable location for a storefront service space, either in or adjacent to
the Downtown Eastside."
The vision ofATM-style opioid dispensers evokes Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, in which an opioid-
style drug, soma, is given to the lower castes. This approach threatens to reduce man into a machine. It's no
giant leap from the state-sanctioned distribution ofsoma to the untouchables of the World State to the
administration of "clean" hydromorphone to the desperate tent-dwellers of East Hastings Street.
Huxley's novel illustrates how the science of addiction can't be untangled from its moral, political, and
philosophical dimensions. Huxley's fear was that, without restraint, addiction could become the dominant
refuge from the difficulties of existence. "There's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your
enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering," he wrote. "In the past you could only accomplish these
things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-
gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality
about in a bottle. Christianity without tears—that's what soma is."
Harm reduction is ultimately a pessimistic philosophy. It rests on the premise that human beings are
subordinated to biological determinism, with almost no room for agency, hope, or grace, and maintains
that science can lead us out of the darkness of addiction and human despair. Yet despite harm reduction's
influence over social policy for decades now, there seems no end in sight for the disorder of neighborhoods
like the Downtown Eastside. As tents continue to line the streets of major cities, the addiction crisis
demands an answer. Harm reduction isn't it.

While Vancouver police proclaim victory in a recent crackdown on crime in the Downtown Eastside,
some locals fear the boost in beat cops is pushing people who use drugs into harm's way.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Last week, Vancouver police increased foot patrols in the impoverished neighbourhood to address "street
disorder" and prevent violence. Police said the sweeps came in response to a surge in complaints from
residents, business owners and visitors. As well, people with mobility issues and the elderly have
complained about blocked sidewalks and doorways.

But dmg users and groups representing the marginalized believe the bolstered police presence has
deterred people from using overdose-prevention services during the fentanyl-related overdose crisis.
Last week, the B.C. Coroners Service announced that L422 people had died of a suspected overdose in
2017. up 43 per cent from 2016. Fentanyl was detected in 81 per cent of cases and 88 per cent of deaths
were indoors.

"I feel that (the police wiU) find a way to incriminate you, if they can, because they want to meet their
quota," said Larissa, who visited the Overdose Prevention Society at 58 East Hastings St. on Saturday.
Larissa, who asked that her last name not be printed, said people who use dmgs can feel dehumanized
by police, and uniformed officers standing outside an injection site will make them feel unwelcome. She
worries her friends may instead use alone, use dirty needles or get robbed while hiding in alleyways.
"I think that it will make a lot of people stop coming," she said. "They could just be out in the alley,
dropping.'

Joy, an Overdose Prevention Society volunteer in recovery, who also asked that her last name not be
printed, said there's been a marked decrease in visits since the police crackdown.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
She said most visitors know police "are here to do their job" but at the same time worry they may get
nabbed for possession. When police round the corner to the alleyway behind the OPS, drug users shout
"Six up!" and scatter into the shadows, she said.
"They just want to be somewhere where it's comfortable," she said. "As long as the police aren't
harassing them, nobody really says much of anything."
Deputy Chief Howard Chow said the increased police activity in the Downtown Eastside will
continue. But Chow said beat officers remain focused on "predators that exploit drug addicts." He said
police policy is to crack down on organized crime, not pick up people with addictions on minor
possession charges.
"The reality of it is that police officers and beat officers have been part of that landscape, part of the
community, for decades," Chow said. "Our members are regularly guiding, directing - even assisting and
bringing - those that are drug addicts to those overdose (prevention) sites. Our members are working
tirelessly on the frontline."
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
With an average of one person dying of an overdose in Vancouver each day of 2017, officers will continue
to administer naloxone and pull drug use "out of the laneways," Chow said. "We don't want people to be
using in laneways where all of a sudden people may have a crisis or overdose, and nobody knows it."
Chow said the sweeps have been effective. Last week was only the second week in the past six years
during which there wasn't a single street-level assault or robbery. Police have confiscated knives, a
hatchet and an imitation handgun during searches. They've seized drugs cut with fentanyl as well as
stolen property.
Chow said feedback to police from drugs users and other community members has been overwhelmingly
positive.

Dean Wilson, peer engagement lead with the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, said police crackdowns have
always beeu disruptive. And he believes the current campaign is doing little more than driving people
away from lifesaving health services.
"The problem is, the only people they seem to arrest are the people for possession or some street-
entrenched seller of drugs that's just literally holding for the other guy," Wflson said. "As far as the
violent people they're supposedly going after right now? I don't see any of those arrests."
After a night in jail and with their tolerance way down, an addicted drug user returns to Hastings Street
at a much higher risk of overdose, Wilson said.

Saturday, Postmedia observed four officers stopping a man carrying a boxed, flatscreen television
outside Pigeon Park Savings, next to the street market. One of the officers warned Constance Barnes, an
OPS and street market manager, that she would be arrested for obstruction if she continued chiding
them for their treatment of the television carrier.

"When you see this amount of police presence — and it's rude police presence, (but) not all of them — it
scares the crap out of people (from coming) into the overdose prevention site," Barnes said moments
later. "It scares people away."
Anna Cooper, staff lawyer at Pivot Legal Society, sees a gap in logic between officers standing outside a
"critical lifesaving location" and the force's claim that it is playing a critical role in fighting overdose.
"If that's their goal, then they might be achieving it in some ways, but they're actively undermining it at
the same time," Cooper said. "If you have a naloxone kit in one hand and a substance user's personal
belongings in the other hand, you're in a really conflicted role, in terms of helping people."
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Cooper said Pivot has received a surge in calls and concerns about the recent sweeps. While police say
they're protecting the vulnerable, the vulnerable tell Pivot they feel threatened and harassed, she said.
"Most of the stories that we're hearing isn't that they're intervening in fights and keeping the peace that
way," Cooper said. "It's that they're basically shaking down people who are visibly poor."

A two-block stretch of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside accounts for an astounding number of the entire province's calls
to 911 reporting an drug overdose.
TRAVISLUPICK
Vancouver's Downtown Eastside entered a new and more intense phase of the opioid crisis last
winter, one that was characterized by significantly more overdoses beyond the increase that had
already occurred before 2016.

That picture emerges from B.C. Emergency Health Sendees data supplied at the Straight's
request. It covers 911 calls for suspected overdoses in what is often described as ground zero for
the drug epidemie: the two-block stretch of East Hastings Street that runs from Carrall Street to
Main Street.

Then, in September of that year, the number of calls jumped to 103, and it continued to rise, to a
peak of 262 in November 2016.
A downward trend followed. For the first six months of 2017, calls declined but still averaged 180
per month.

Then the situation appears to have settled. During the last six months of 2017, there was an
average of 125 overdose calls each month. That's far lower than the peak of 262 but still more than
double the average for the first six months of 2016.
The rise coincides with a period when fentanyl was detected in increasing numbers of overdose
victims and when an even more dangerous synthetic opioid, carfentanil, is known to have arrived
in B.C.
Brian Twaites is an advanced-care paramedic who works for the B.C. Ambulance Service in the
Downtown Eastside. "Did we expect it to get worse?" he asked in a telephone interview. "We
didn't think it would, but it did. And so we've carried on and dealt with it the best we can."
In addition to call volumes, he noted that calls are more intense.
B.C. EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES / TRAVIS LUPICK
Twaites also called attention to the total number of calls, noting "compassion fatigue" has become
an issue.
During the two years for which the Straight was supplied numbers, these two blocks of East
Hastings Street saw 3,004 calls for suspected overdoses (compared to 42,716 for all of B.C.).
Twaites said the provincial government has come through with additional resources.
B.C. Emergency Health Services received $5 million in new provincial funding in November 2016
and, in January 2018, hired 10 full-time and eight part-time paramedics. It is also in the process

of adding 20 paramedic specialists, who provide clinical and technical support.
"We are getting more paramedic units out on the road, and we've developed a resilience course for
occupation stress," Twaites said.

According to the B.C. Coroners Service, 1,422 people in British Columbia died of an illicit-drug
overdose last year, up from 993 in 2016, 518 in 2015, and 369 in 2014. Fentanyl, carfentanil, and
analogs were associated with 81 percent of deaths in 2017.
The two blocks examined by the Straight host two of the city's busiest supervised-consumption
facilities, where people can bring drugs to use under staff supervision. The loo block is home to
North America's first supervised-injection facility, Insite, and 62 East Hastings is the address for
Vancouver's first overdose-prevention site (a stripped-down injection site).
uf^
For the years 2016 to 2017, the two blocks of East Hastings Street that stretch from Pigeon Park to Main Street accounted
for seven percent of the entire province's 911 calls for a suspected drug overdose.
TRAVIS LUPICK
In a telephone interview, the latter's founder and manager, Sarah Blyth, suggested the situation
may not have improved as much as the stats suggest. She explained the declines in numbers
observed since last winter could be the result of staff doing a better job responding to overdoses
before they require a call to 911. Many potential overdoses can be avoided simply by engaging
someone who took drugs in a way that keeps them conscious, Blyth said.
"We're still in a crisis," she added. "Yesterday, we had four overdoses. So it's still a crisis. Fentanyl
is everywhere.

Trey Helten, frontline worker for the Overdose Prevention Society, opens the door for a user at the facility

RAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL
It's just another day on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-what-i-saw-in-a-day-on-the-downtown-eastside-shocked-me/ 1/8
4/26/23, 10:20 AM What I saw in a day on the Downtown Eastside shocked me - The Globe and Mail
A young man sits on the wet sidewalk, his legs spread wide, sucking the smoke from
a burning fragment of dope with a plastic tube. A man with lank black hair is
slumped against a wall, bent over double like a limp marionette, his dangling arm
twitching at his side. A woman in skinny jeans, leaning on a storefront, pulls the
plunger of a syringe carefully up and down, getting ready to give herself a hit. An
open package of dainty cookies lies by her side.
Canada's opioids crisis has swept like a wildfire from the West Coast to the cities and
towns of the East. But in the place where the match first dropped, the fire is still
burning hard.
Scores are being killed by the poison in their drugs - their respiration slowing to a
halt in an alleyway, a toilet stall or a lonely room. Eleven people died of overdoses in
Vancouver in the space of just one awful week this past summer. On a single day,
July 24, paramedics responded to 130 suspected-overdose calls. Of the nearly 8,000
such calls last year, about 5,000 were from the Downtown Eastside.
To get a sense for what the crisis looks like at ground zero, I spent a day there last
week. This was a rough neighbourhood when I worked briefly at the local
courthouse for a Vancouver newspaper in the 1970s, with alcoholics spilling out of
the seedy bars, drug-dealing in the alleyways and hundreds of hard-up men living in
flophouses. It is far, far worse now.
In the heart of one of the world's most "livable" cities, just next to the boutiques and
bistros ofGastown, shocking scenes of human degradation unfold every day. I don't
think I've seen anything like it - not in Mumbai or Manila, not in inner-city Detroit
or the South Side of Chicago.
On the morning that I arrived, throngs of weathered, wounded people were out on
the rain-soaked sidewalks of East Hastings Street, the neighbourhood's broad central
avenue. Some sold pathetic trinkets on the sidewalk. Others huddled in doorways to
stay dry. Still others pushed overflowing carts full of belongings. Many were taking
their drugs openly on the street.

Mr. Helten was a former addict before helping to run the Overdose Prevention Society.
RAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL
Trey Helten helped show me around. A towering 35-year-old wearing a biker jacket
over a hoodie, he was an addict himself for seven years. He lived the last stretch on
the street, homeless, scrounging for the next hit. Now he helps run the Overdose
Prevention Society on Hastings.
Users come there to take their drugs under the watchful eyes of OPS staff, who hand
out clean syringes and stand ready to intervene with oxygen and the emergency
drug naloxone. Mr. Helten wears an oximeter on a lanyard around his neck so he can
measure the pulse and oxygen level of visitors who show signs of going under.
The place opens at 8 in the morning, is full by 10 and stays busy till closing at 9. It
gets 300 to 400 visitors a day and there are several others like it, including the
pioneering Insite just across the street. Are you smokin' or pokin? - inhaling or

injecting - the staff ask visitors who come to use the lighted cubicles in the society's
outdoor tent. Some do both.
At a second set of cubicles inside, a burly French-Canadian with tattoos up and down
his thick arms asked a pal to insert the needle straight into the jugular vein in his
neck for a better rush. Before he used, he tested his supply at a new device that uses
infrared light to search drugs for additives. It often detects powdered caffeine,
sweetener and even drywall dust, used by dealers to bulk up their product.

Mr. Helten fills syringes with naloxone, a medication used to counter the effects of opioid overdoses.
RAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL
The site does its best to keep people safe, but many are still succumbing to drugs
laced with fentanyl, the potent synthetic opioid. Despite its risks - a few grains can
be deadly - fentanyl remains a popular drug because it's so strong. Mr. Helten says
some are ecstatic when tests find it in their dose. "It's what they're looking for."

He took me out into the back alley, known as a favourite place to smoke crack-
cocaine. A new wall mural shows a weeping angel carrying the Christ-like body of an
overdose victim. On it, people have scrawled the names and nicknames of their dead
pals: Russian Bobby, Sideshow, Buster, Tito, Fatal, Yaya. Just about everyone down
here has lost a friend.
Yet the band plays on. At Hastings and Main, the neighbourhood's historic heart, a
comer man called out "drugs, hard drugs." A few steps away in "Piss Alley," named
for its notorious stench, a couple of dozen men stood in the rain among the
dumpsters and litter - buying, selling, using.

tribute walls in the neighbourhood.
RAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL
My visit left me reeling. How can it be that, instead of improving in the four decades
since I first saw it, this neighbourhood has declined so dramatically? How have so
many people come to live in such desolation? How can such a place exist in a
country such as Canada?
It's easy to despair of the Downtown Eastside. It has been so wretched for so long
that it is tempting to think it will never change. Before the overdose crisis came the
murder of local prostitutes by pig farmer Robert Pickton and the
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, many of whom ended up vulnerable and
homeless on local streets.
Governments have spent hundreds of millions trying to "fix" the area. Vancouver's
new mayor, Kennedy Stewart, has promised to set up an emergency task force, a

gesture that makes those who know the place roll their eyes. The problems here are
as complex as they get. The proffered answers - more money for social housing,
better education about drugs and their dangers - often seem simplistic.
And yet, giving up on the Downtown Eastside would be an awful mistake. All of the
failures of this fortunate, thriving, caring country are on display on these streets: its
failure to grapple with the crisis of mental health, its failure to tame the epidemic of
drug overdoses, its failure to improve the condition of many Indigenous people, its
failure to put a roof over the heads of its neediest citizens.
The suffering of this neighbourhood and its people should weigh on us all.

BY JASON RANTZ I share r^ I
The Jason Rantz Show, 3pm-7pm on KTTH '—
Seattle will get a safe injection site. Activists in and out of city hall do
not care about the will of King County voters. They're convinced this
is a good idea. It's not. It's dangerous, it's disturbing, and it took me
10 minutes in Vancouver to realize this.
RELATED: Dwindling options for Seattle CHEL site
The vast majority of safe injection site proponents haven't visited the
Vancouver neighborhood that hosts Insite. They should. It's
frightening and has no place in Seattle.
I visited Vancouver for leg one of the MLS western conference
semifinals. On a walk around the city before the game, I decided to
visit the site of "North America's first legal supervised injection site."
It was about 9:45 a.m. on Sunday, Oct. 29. The immediate area
around East Hastings Street is a one-stop shop to feed your heroin
addiction. I witnessed one heroin deal. It was done right in the open,
without any concern. The exchange was quick but casual. Dozens of
homeless people laid about, nearly lifeless, some staring down the
street, a couple playing with mini-vaporizers, while others walked
around like zombies — dazed and meandering.
Litter is everywhere. The blocks around Insite felt dangerous. Some
tourists were harassed by the homeless. I was followed by one, who
kept asking me why about a dozen people were lined up behind a
truck. I didn't know. I imagine it was an outreach organization handing
out much-needed supplies.
There is no room in Seattle — or King County — for a safe injection
site. It will kill businesses. It will make us unsafe. And it will keep
people addicted to heroin. I also suspect it would normalize heroin
dealing. Seattle city officials like Councilmember Mike O'Brien already

want less enforcement on lawlessness, particularly as it relates to the
homeless. If we effectively legalize heroin, how are we supposed to
enforce drug dealing laws? If the argument is that safe injections sites
are compassionate, then wouldn't it be equally compassionate to
allow them to purchase the heroin to use at the safe injection sites?
Safe injection sites stop the spread of diseases when you take used
needles out of the equation. It also stops deadly overdoses. These
are valid reasons to entertain the concept, but it's not foolproof and is
less effective than successfully treating the addiction. And proponents
overstate the benefits.
These benefits hold true so long as people use the sites. They do not
stop an overdose when the heroin addict is using in Northgate or
Ballard or the University District, unable or unwilling to travel to the
one or two safe injection sites in the city. Some will start camping out
around the safe injection site, as they do around Insite. Which several
blocks of Seattle will O'Brien or his colleagues give to addicts? I
suppose they won't set up shop in city hall, in the heart of Downtown
Seattle where there are scores of people who would surely use this
service.
It's really easy for activists to support safe injection sites, not truly
understanding what this will do to the neighborhood that hosts it. I
don't think most of these activists care to experience it. It's an easy bit
of virtue signaling to tell the world you support safe injection sites
because you want to show how much compassion you claim to feel
about those dealing with addiction. The problem is this kind of virtue
signaling not just hurts the people you aim to help — after all, safe
injection sites don't treat the addiction — but you'll be devastating
neighborhoods in the process.
This would be a blight on any Seattle neighborhood. This part of
Vancouver is a disaster and these people are in desperate need of
help, not a safe space to shoot up, judgment-free. They need 100

and no city should tolerate it.

Supervisors with DTES Markets attend to a possible overdose next to their pop-up injection site in Vancouver, British Columbia
on November 21,2016.
Last week, Edmonton city hall voted 10-1 in favour of building not just one "safe consumption" sites for
drugs, but four of them — all within walking distance of one another in one of the city's lowest-income
urban districts.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
The decision was made despite the fact that more than 80 per cent of Edmonton's fentanyl-related
overdoses are occurring in the suburbs — well beyond the reach of the new facilities. The move also
ignores fervent pleas from locals, who claim that approving four drug consumption sites will be a death
for their already chaotic and drug-ridden neighbourhood.

And honestly, it's hard to see how the locals are wrong. While the strategy of harm reduction can indeed

These unhappy results can be seen a province away. Vancouver is into its second decade of dealing with
an injected-drug crisis. The city has been concentrating more and more services in its Downtown
Eastside. The result? Everything seems to be getting worse.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Homelessness numbers continue to rise. There were 2,138 homeless individuals in Vancouver in 2017 —
compared to only 1,364 in 2005. Theft and violent crime in the Downtown Eastside have gone up since
2002. And as an overdose crisis sweeps Canada, Vancouver is its undisputed epicentre. Even with teams
of naloxone-armed paramedics addressing a nightly rush of overdosed drug users, more than 100 people
have died of overdoses in 2017 — with most of these occurring within the narrow borders of the
Downtown Eastside.
And yet, all across the continent planners can be heard talking up Vancouver's success on the addiction
file.
They're usually pointing to the success of Insite, which was established in 2003 as North America's first
safe injection site.

In his bestselling book Chasing the Scream, British author Johann Hari said Vancouver gave him a
"sense of hope" for the future of dmg policy. Seattle is now planning to open the first safe-injection site
in the United States, with proponents citing the "beyond amazing" example of Insite."
Or there's the oft-cited example of Philip Owen, Vancouver's former conservative-minded mayor who
became one of Insite's most fervent supporters. You're not encouraging people to use drugs by opening
a supervised injection site. You're assisting people who need help," Owen told Postmedia in 2016.
And Insite's supporters are right; safe-injection sites are good at what they do. But they really only do
one thing: prevent people from dying.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
It does not seem to reduce crime. There is slim evidence to show that it reduces overall addiction rates.
And it certainly doesn't lead to livable neighbourhoods filled with healthy people.
"After they opened Insite, it was like a warm hug from God... I mean people used to die here from
overdose almost every day," one Downtown Eastside drug user told the authors of a 2012 study.
Safe injection sites are designed to do away with the most nightmarish aspects of injection drug use:
Addicts sharing needles, using puddle water for injections, getting robbed after a fix and dying of
overdoses. A frequently cited 2QU_Eaper in The Lancet that studied Insite's success found a 35 per cent
decrease in the fatal overdose rate in the several blocks immediately surrounding the facility. And a
2009 review by Simon Fraser University criminologist Martin A. Andresen estimated that Insite saves
three lives per year.

But this is only one part of Vancouver's drug story.
For one, the drugs consumed at Insite are pre-obtained," which is to say that they are still purchased by
users on the black market. With about 700 injections occurring on site per day, it follows that there is
still a vibrant market for dmg suppliers — the very ones now cutting their product with lethal doses of
fentanyl.

Insite's own website says that "supervised injection facilities can help people quit drugs" — but the
data proving as much is slim. The two major studies that Insite references cover a limited time
period, and only document an increase in admissions to detoxification. To date, there is no definitive,
long-term data showing that Vancouver's injection drug users are successfully getting clean and kicking
dmgs because of safe injection.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Meanwhile, a 2006 British Medical Tournal study looked at the years before and after Insite's opening
and found "no substantial decrease in the rate of stopping injected drug use." While Insite will provide
referrals to drug treatment, they also aim to be "low barrier." Site staff do not want to alienate patients
by counselling or pressuring them to seek treatment.
A 2012 thesis, in which Simon Fraser University student Jennifer Vishloff interviewed Insite nurses,
mentions staff having to clench their teeth when encountering fresh-faced drug-users who were still
entranced with the excitement of the Downtown Eastside.
"Even though I want to tell them to 'run out of there! It's important that I give them a really good
experience so that they come back and when they have their crisis... they come to us," said one nurse.
Another described assisting a drunk reveler with their first-ever hit of heroin. "I didn't feel comfortable

signing them up because they definitely weren't entrenched," she said. "Yet at the same time they were
intoxicated which increases their overdose risk."
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Even for those who get into treatment, it is notoriously difficult to get clean on the Downtown Eastside.
Anyone leaving detox steps back into a neighbourhood where are their friends are users, all their
neighbours are users, and where the whole machinery of the community seems to be geared towards
injection drug use. "Nobody can go through recovery here, for the most part, it's just not possible," Kate
Gibson, executive director of WISH, a drop-in centre for survival sex workers, told the National Post in
2014.

Vancouver's error was to see Insite's success, and to then allow the surrounding neighbourhood to
be increasingly shaped by the philosophy of harm reduction. For example, there's the whimsically
decorated crack-pipe vending machine. The city also dropped the Hastings Street speed limit to 30
km/h, to protect addicts who are unable to demarcate the road from a sidewalk.

There's also a city hall-funded street market" that — despite organizers' fervent claims to the contrary
— is well-known bv locals to be a brazen hotspot for stolen goods. There are now more than 170 non-
profits clustered in an area of only a few blocks, all devoted towards supporting an increasingly dense
community of addicts. In a 2015 interview, longtime Downtown Eastside organizer Scott dark referred
to the growth of a pipeline for vulnerable populations" that has become a magnet over the years."
These service providers, and the government managers that keep funding these agencies, they refuse
to look at the evidence that says putting these many vulnerable people in one building, in one
community, is simply not healthy for anyone," said dark, executive director of the Aboriginal Live in
Vancouver Enhancement Society.

The people who want to prevent more Downtown Eastsides all say the same thing: Do not try to address
a drug problem by concentrating all your services on skid row. You can't just focus on harm reduction,
you also have to focus on prevention, education and enforcement," said Tom Stamatkis, the president of
the Vancouver Police Union, in 2016.

Philip Owen would say much the same. The former mayor is still fervently pro-Insite — and attends drug
policy conferences around the world to say as much — but he is deeply troubled by the neighbourhood
that has developed around it. "You just keep dumping money in, building social housing and filling it up
with people from all around the region and the country ... they all get chemically dependent, and it's
just more sales for the drug dealers," he told the National Post in 2014.

Health Canada is currently reviewing 10 additional applications for Canadian injection sites, including
three from Toronto, two from Surrey, B.C., one from Victoria, one from Ottawa and one for a mobile site
in Montreal.
Neighbourhoods like the Downtown Eastside don't happen by accident. Every community across Canada
has addiction problems, but it's only through years of poor planning that an out-of-control disaster like
Vancouver's starts to develop.
It is a noble and moral thing to prevent addicts from dying of overdoses in alleys and dingy apartments,
and none of the problems cited above are reasons to not build a safe injection site. But it is perverse to
look at the Downtown Eastside and claim that it is in anyway a holistic success. It is palliative care on a
mass scale; a system that can keep hearts from stopping, but little else.
Before cities throw in their lot with the Vancouver model," it's important to understand the very strict
limitations of what has been accomplished there — and to vociferously avoid all that has been done
wrong.

Drug addicts inject heroin on the back steps of the Washington Hotel. PHOTO BY PETER BATTISTONI /VANCOUVER SUN
I wrote this column more than 10 years ago, not long after I returned to reporting after a stint in
newsroom management. I had hoped to capture the desperation of the people I encountered with fresh
eyes. In no way do I wish to minimize or exploit their suffering. lam angry that life on the streets of the
Downtown Eastside has not changed appreciably in the interuening decade.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
HIS HAIR is black and tangled under his ball cap. The moniker stitched into his jacket is Rusty, but I
doubt that's his name. He picks at the ground with blackened fingernails near a knot of drug dealers,
hoping to assemble enough crack cocaine to get a hit.

A few strides away, the alley is teeming with people heating the ends of their crack pipes.
It is midday and the traffic of customers is continuous for the drug dealers. After a quick huddle on the
sidewalk, the deal is done. The addicts hurry to the alley to find a doorway or a dumpster to use as cover
— from the wind mostly, no one cares if the police are watching — for a few deep hits from the pipe and a
few minutes of relief from a bone-gnawing craving.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
As I walk up the alley, the faces that emerge from the smoke are ghostly white and emaciated, like skulls.
Their stares are as vacant as the storefronts that line Hastings between Main and Carrall.
City workers in orange vests walk the alleys and streets of what the city calls Area A, often under the gaze
of police officers. The four blocks bordering the intersection of East Hastings and Columbia Streets form

the core of the Downtown Eastside, the epicentre of hell.
In fact, the locals here greet outsiders with a cheerful, "Welcome to hell."
A group of street cleaners passes, heading north on Columbia. The street and sidewalks behind them are
tidy. Their shovels and bins are full of cigarette wrappers, chip bags and snack cake boxes. The street
ahead of them is still strewn with trash. The snow beside the garbage can on the corner is black. The bin
itself is empty but there is trash lying all around it.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
The doorways of abandoned storefronts are sprayed with blood and littered with discarded syringes.
Above the Radio Station Cafe are several storeys of apartments with window boxes mounted up the side
of the building. The marigolds are doing their best, but it isn't enough. They look very lonely.
The boarded-up windows and doors are a magnet for graffiti. There are names and the usual assortment
of bad language and even some drawings. I am impressed by the intricate rendering of two syringes
crossed like the bones on a pirate flag. The messages, political and personal, are gibberish.
As if to light a candle rather than curse the darkness, the City of Vancouver has posted a letter-sized
piece of paper in one doorway at 112 East Hastings St. with a bold red stamp reading "Legal Notice." The
order requires the removal of graffiti, though there is none apparent. Every other building in the area is
covered with scrawl, but not this one.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
A man with long, nicotine-stained grey hair walks out the front door of the Regent Hotel and kicks at the
discarded cups and newspapers on the sidewalk, then goes back inside. Outside The Only Sea Foods, a
woman wails for a dollar from passersby. Her face is twisted with anguish, her sweatpants bloody from
the knee down. In the doorway of the Downtown Eastside Residents Association, a couple lies in a huge
pile of cardboard, blankets and suitcases. The two look sick and both have a gravelly cough.The office is
closed. A small crowd is gathered, watching them.
The United We Can bottle return depot is the most popular business in the area, with a lineup that
reaches down the block. This is where the city's binners — the people who fill bags and shopping carts
with returnable empties — come to get paid. A makeshift flea market springs up here in the afternoons.
People are selling what they have from little squares of fabric. One man offers a snow-globe, a video

game controller, a hacky sack and a novelty rubber hand. Another has channel changers, four of them,
and plastic toys still wrapped in plastic.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
The crowd is well-behaved, but the police swoop in about every half hour or so. On their third visit, one
officer has a lengthy argument with one man and then another is arrested. The man is cuffed while five
officers mill around. The crowd takes little notice.
The alley behind United We Can is humming with activity. As I enter the alley, a city worker with a
wheeled trash bin passes by a large malodorous pile of garbage. Even though it is near freezing, the
stench is powerful. A woman looks up at me as she inserts a needle into her ankle. Two men pass by with
plates heaped high with potato salad, bread and lasagna. Pieces of bread are dropped everywhere, as are
discarded socks and men's underwear.
Midway up the alley, a cube van unloads a dozen kegs of beer behind the Dodson Hotel and just beyond
it are about a dozen people smoking crack. A police car pulls into the mouth of the alley, but nobody
moves. The police car backs up and moves on. More crack is smoked.

Cautionary words from Vancouver Police Union about supervised injection sites
By null

Last Updated Mar 14, 2016, 4:14PM PDT.
This article is more than 5 years old.
VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) - The Vancouver Police Union has some cautionary words for Toronto as that city looks to bring in supervised injection sites.
The comments come after the Toronto Police Association pointed to Vancouver police saying the force has had to deal with a lot of street disorder because of these sites.
Vancouver Police Union President Tom Stamatakls says if a city is considering a facility like Vancouver's INSITE, it needs to make sure all issues can be managed properly. The issues
he is referencing include drug use, trafficking and distribution.
"So that wherever these facilities are located, the negative impact of the associated drug use can be managed so other citizens aren't negatively impacted," says Union President
Torn Stamatakis. "I think when you look at illegal drugs and activities associated to that you need to look at it more holistically. You can't just focus on harm reduction, you also have
to focus on prevention, education and enforcement."
Stamatakis agrees police here have had to deal with a lot more because of supervised injection sites.

Brent Foster/National Post/File
VANCOUVER - In a campaign that has otherwise been pretty scant on details, mayoral challenger Kirk
LaPointe rolled out at least one policy point that got some attention: If elected, the former journalist
would initiate a crackdown on the drug dealers of the Downtown Eastside.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
"The people that bother me the most are the predators down here, the people that are taking the few
dollars that the residents have from them," he said in an interview with Gastown Gazette, a vocal
advocate against what it has called the neighbourhood's "revolving door poverty policies." "Those are
the people that I think have to be rerouted out of the system."

It's fertile election terrain. Mayor Gregor Robertson was elected in 2008 with a vow to "end
homelessness by 20 IS." But it remains fertile electoral terrain - because after years of pumping the area
with social housing units, not only has the homeless count actually gone up, but the new roofs seemed
to have little effect on the area's epidemic of drug use and on-street chaos.

It is among Canada's greatest puzzles: Why has one of the country's richest, most beautiful cities

spending?

shattered populace back on their feet, or cleaning up the neighbourhood into something resembling a
healthy community.
Until that changes, say critics, Canada's poorest postal code" is only going to get worse.
"We've made it Fortress Downtown Eastside; easy to get in, exceptionally hard to get out of," says Ernie
Crey, president of the AREA'S Aboriginal Life In Vancouver Enhancement Society (ALIVE).

As Vancouver's cheapest neighbourhood—and the site of most of its social and Aboriginal services—the

Once there, "quite literally, there are going to be people on your doorstep dealing drugs or encouraging
drug use ... and beyond that, they're going to try and exploit you in other ways, like turning you out for
prostitution," says Mr. Grey, whose sister Dawn lived in the neighbourhood for 20 years before she was
murdered by serial killer Robert Pickton.
ALIVE, which does not take government funding, is one of the most vocal critics of what it calls the
Downtown Eastside's "broken system": Unaccountable non-profits, a general disinterest in tracing the
impact of government funding, and a complete lack of any coherent end-game for the place.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
"The way things are happening now, things are going to get much worse, it's just a terrible system,
straight-up," said ALIVE's executive director, Scott dark. "Everybody should agree this is unacceptable."
Comprising 18,500 residents, the Downtown Eastside has always been rough around the edges. As far
back as the 1950s, Skid Road, as it was known, was already notorious for its high concentration of beer
parlours, mayhem and murder.
But it has only been in the last few decades that a tough neighbourhood has devolved into one of the
worst in Canada. Hard drugs replaced booze, patients from de-institutionalized mental hospitals
flooded in and police presence was pulled back and the area became dominated by social services.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Leo Knight walked the Downtown Eastside as a Vancouver beat cop in the 1980s, when he said officers
were able to keep on lid on the area's "bubbling cauldron" of crime. That is, until beat teams were
abolished in favour of a softer community policing" approach.

"In a nutshell, the police gave up the streets in the early 1990s," he said. "What we have now is the
largest open-air drug bazaar in North America, and in my day, we didn't tolerate it."
As of 2009, there were more than 250 service agencies and housing operations in the Downtown
Eastside, spending a total of $360 million per year. Roll in the spending on social assistance, and the
area easily costs that $1 million a day.
"You just keep dumping money in, building social housing and filling it up with people from all around
the region and the country... they all get chemically dependent, and it's just more sales for the drug
dealers," says Philip Owen, Vancouver's mayor from 1993 to 2002.

As the conservative-minded son of a B.C. Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Owen was the unlikely champion of
Insite, the city's supervised injection site.
But he staunchly opposes what he calls the city's unilateral policy of "ghettoizing people" in the
Downtown Eastside, rather than spreading social housing throughout the city.
It is easier said than done. Terrified at the prospect of becoming another chaotic, needle-strewn corner
of the city, neighbourhoods are known to militantly oppose anything with the slightest whiff of being a
homeless shelter.

Last December, for instance, the opening of a 40-person short-term housing facility in East Vancouver
prompted an angry mob of local residents to flood the building's lobby in protest. "We didn't anticipate
100 Chinese people coming and yelling," said City Councillor Kerry Jang, who was dispatched to calm
the crowd.

More recently, a downtown neighbourhood rose in revolt to a city plan to temporarily house 150
homeless in a leased Quality Inn. "Everybody knows this will result in hundreds more police and
ambulance calls in that neighbourhood per year," wrote one letter-writer to the Vancouver Sun.
And merely housing the homeless does almost nothing to address the underlying problem of drug
addiction.
"Nobody can go through recovery here, for the most part, it's just not possible," says Kate Gibson,
executive director of WISH, a drop-in centre for survival sex workers (women who use prostitution to
pay for their addictions).

Stanley Q. Woodvine, a homeless Vancouver blogger who supports himself by collecting beverage
containers, took up the issue of drug addiction in a lengthy October post, saying that Vancouver's policy
of simply "warehousing" the drug-addicted "can't end homelessness and neither will it sustainably slow
it down.
"It is not a stepping stone to real independence but more of a dumping ground for misfits ...a kind of
gulag full of people with no expectations beyond their next government assistance cheque or hoot,
whichever comes first," he said.
In fact, the Downtown Eastside has increasingly been shaped into a place tailor-made to house a
permanent population of addicts.

The neighbourhood's Drug Users Resource Centre recently debuted Canada's first crack pipe vending
machine, followed closely by a program to teach alcoholics how to brew their own beer.

When too many Downtown Eastsiders were being killed after staggering into the street, the city dropped
the speed limit on Hastings to 30 km/h. When activists balked at a police crackdown on illegal street
vending, city hall put up $30,000 for a weekly binner's" market that has become notorious as a hotspot
for stolen goods.
Michelle Fortin is the executive director ofWatari, a Downtown Eastside group that counsels youth back
into "self-sufficiency." She says that in trying to give dignity to the addicted, there are groups who have
taken to "managing people" in their current state, rather than helping them develop an "exit strategy."
"The idea is not to make them comfortable in their circumstance, the idea is to get them to take some
risks to do things better and differently," she says.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
But after years of stagnancy in the Downtown Eastside, a popular theory among Vancouverites is that
the neighbourhood is kept unhealthy on purpose - with too many non-profit and poverty pimps"
relying on Downtown Eastside funding, they're incentivized to stick to the status quo.
They want to maintain themselves, these people are poverty administrators, they want to be there,
says Mr. Crey.
The theory is a good way to anger a Downtown Eastside social worker, and Sean Condon, the editor of
Megaphone Magazine, a street newspaper sold by coastal B.C. homeless people, says it's a myth.

No one wants rampant drug addiction to continue, no one wants rampant poverty to continue."
Still, the myth wasn't shattered by news in March that one of the Downtown Eastside's dominant
charities, the Portland Hotel Society, was caught spending tens of thousands on limos, luxury hotel
rooms and European vacations.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Further disillusionment came when restaurants opening up in the formerly abandoned buildings of the
Downtown Eastside found themselves subjected to months of aggressive protests—and even
threatening torchlit marches—by self-styled poverty activists."
More galling still, many of these demonstrations were organized by the Carnegie Community Action
Project, a hard-left group that receives funding from City Hall and operates out of city-owned buildings.
'To me it's astounding that we accept all this," says Michael Geller, a Vancouver architect who has had
involvement in Downtown Eastside planning. I think collectively they've simply decided that maybe
it's not such a bad place."
With an eye to a less chaotic Downtown Eastside, Mr. Geller had pinned his hopes on a Local Area Plan
being drafted by City Hall. Instead, the result was a 221-page document that expertly skirted around any
mention of the Downtown Eastside as a failed community in need of a drastic turnaround.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW
The Downtown Eastside's informal economy" of dumpster diving and bartering was instead described
as a "vital part" of the neighbourhood. Hastings St., a stretch of shopping carts, stolen bikes and people
in the violent throes of narcotics, was a place where locals meet friends, get support, access services
and feel like they belong."
The report only mentioned the word "drug" six times.
Neighbourhood boosters have long insisted there is a palpable sense of community in the Downtown
Eastside, and they are right. But to those caught in the grind of what Mr. Woodvine called Vancouver's
gulag," most are eager to leave.
"I can tell you as a provider of youth housing, people don't ask to be housed in the Downtown Eastside,"
says Ms. Fortin.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
The Ontario Association of Chiefs  of Police (OACP), which r epresents Ontario’s top law 
enforcement professionals, does not support the introduction of supervised injection sites in 
Ontario. We believe such facilities will encourage, not reduce, the consumption of illicit drugs 
among users.  
 
The resultant financial benefits accruing to organized crime groups from increased drug activity 
gives these syndicates an incentive to engage in vi olent activity in order to maintain their 
dominant position.  
 
Even more disturbing, numerous c ommunities across North America  have been devastated as 
the violence associated with illicit drugs forces people and businesses to move out. Thus, the 
consumptio n of illicit drugs at supervised injection sites will inevitably lead to a general 
degradation of the social and economic life of communities in which these facilities are situated.  
 
The Insite facility in Vancouver initially received an exemption under th e Criminal Code of 
Canada  in order to operate legally. However, in 2008, the Federal Government  decided not to 
renew that privilege, sparking a court challenge by the injection facility.  
 
On September 30, 2011 , the Supreme Court of Canada ordered the feder al government to grant 
an exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act  to Vancouver’s supervised 
injection site. The Court argued that denying this exemption  – thereby preve nting the clinic from 
operating – undermined  drug users’ section 7 Chart er rights because such individuals  would no 
longer be able to access health services provided by the facility.  
 
The OACP, however, believes the evidence the court used to show the positive impacts from 
supervised injection sites is not convincing, in part  because other health -related experts have 
expressed reservations about these facilities.  
 
In 2008 , Health Canada’s Expert Advisory Committee stated that limitations on existing 
techniques tainted most evidence gleaned from the Vancouver experience. The Committee  
surmised  that t he best that could be ascertain ed from the available evidence  was that the 
injection facility had failed to meet its stated objectives.  Finally, the Expert Advisory Committee 
criticized the methodology showing improved public order i n the area around the clinic . In fact, it 
noted that other studies indicating  deterioration in public order at such injections sites was the 
norm.  
 
Supervised injection sites do not adequately address treatment for intravenous drug users. 
Essentially, ther e is only an inadequate measure of the number of drug users that have 
managed to end their addiction because of the Vancouver facility. Indeed, the clinic’s w ebsite 
only indicates a 1.6% success rate in treating addicts.   
 
More problematic, when intraveno us drug users consume illicit drugs, organized crime groups 
ultimately reap the benefits. This has been well documented in the World Drug Report  produced 
by the United Nations.  
 
Thus, the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police does not support the introdu ction of supervised 
injection sites in Ontario . We believe such facilities would lead to greater d rug use, more 
organized crime , and a deterioration of community life in areas hosting such facilities .

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Canadian police personnel  have first -hand knowledge and experience in dealing with individuals 
with drug addictions  and the problem associated with substance abuse . When police  respond to 
emergency calls involving illegal drugs, they may face a variety of medical conditions ranging 
from jittery behaviour t o extremely violent tendencies. In some cases, officers find individuals 
without any vital signs who require immediate medical attention . 
 
Worse still, users often purchase their illegal substances from local drug dea lers. I t is this 
interconnec ted web of nefarious activity, linking local dealers to province -wide distributors and 
ultimately to national and international crime organizations, which is most worrisome to law 
enforcement.   
In 1997, British Columbia declared a public health emergency i n Vancouver’s eastside . 
Widespread drug use in the  area had led to a spike in the number of overdose deaths and 
reported cases of HIV/AIDS. At the time, medical practitioners thought the best solution to these 
problems was to open a supervised injection si te in the city’s eastside .  
 
The facility was designed as a place where intravenous drug users could bring their own supply 
of cocaine or heroin and inject themselves in the presence of a nurse who would monitor and 
provide any necessary treatment followin g the injection.  The federal government initially granted 
the clinic an exemption under section 56 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act  (CDSA). A 
2008 effort  to renew this ex emption  was denied, eventually leading to a legal challenge in the 
Supreme C ourt of Canada.  
 
On September 30, 2011, the country’s highest court ruled that the federal government’s 
decision to deny the extension of the  existing exemption under CDSA  section 56  triggered the 
claimant’s section 7 Charter rights because it , “…prevented  injection drug users from accessing 
the health services offered by Insite, threatening their health and indeed their lives.” (R  v PHS 
Community Services 2011)  
 
The Vancouver clinic is run according to the existing harm reduc tion model. Supporter s view the  
purpose of the clinic as one that reduces the “ adverse health, social , and economic 
consequences of drug use without requiring abstinence from drug use.” (Vancouver Coastal 
Health Authority 2011) . Indeed, researchers and harm reduction advocates have long  argued 
the merits of injection facilities, pointing to their positive impact on lowering the number of HIV 
cases and reduced health care spending.  
 
The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP), however, believes the merits of such sites 
are debatab le and should not be used as a rationale for the opening of similar facilities  in the 
Province of Ontario.  
5 
 SUPERVISED INJECTION SITE: EASTSIDE VANCOUVER  
 
A supervised injection site, called Insite, commenced operations in East Vancouver in 2003 in a 
bid to cut the number of drug -related deaths in the area of the city. Supporters said an injection 
facility would achieve a number of objectives , including:  
 
1) providing users with  greater access to health care  
2) reducing the number of ove rdose deaths  
3) cutting the t ransmission of blood -borne viral infections such as HIV  
4) curtailing the incidence of injection infecti ons such as skin abscesses, and  
5) improving public order.  
 
The core services provided by Insite involved supervised injections, first aid related to these 
injections  (e.g., skin abscess care ), referrals to primary health care and service providers and 
other types of counselling, and needle exchange and other drug paraphernalia, alon g with the 
provision of condoms . (Health Canada 2011 ) 
6 
 PUBLISHED STUDY: MEDICAL  AND PUBLIC ORDER BENEFITS  
 
Researchers in British Columbia published their main findings regarding the facility in the British 
medical journal, The Lancet , and argued the Vancouver clinic produced both medical and public 
order benefits.  The purpose of the  relevant study by Thomas Kerr and his colleagues was to 
determine whether the introduction of a supervised injection site in the  Downtown Eastside  
(DTES ) area of Vancouver  reduced the number of drug -related deaths.  
 
The study’ s methodology was based on a n examination of population -based overdose death 
rates between January 1, 2001 and September 20, 2003 – before Insite opened – and between 
September 21, 2003 and December 31, 2005.  
 
Using data from the Coroner’s O ffice, these researchers compared overdose  death rates within 
500 metres of the facility to the rest of the city. They found that overdose deaths decrea sed from 
253.8 to 165.1 per 100, 000 person -years, a reduction of 35%. By contrast, the overdose death 
rate for all of Vancouver decreased from 7.6  to 6.9 deaths, a reduction of slightly more than nine  
per cent. (Marshal et al 2011)  
 
In addition, these experts argued that Insite encouraged intravenous drug users to use the 
facility, and, as a result, should result in more addicts seeking counselling,  obtaining referrals to 
detoxification facilities , and  even placements in  treatment programs.  
 
Another  benefit from the injection facility, according to its supporters, would accrue to the 
community from the reduced transmission of blood -borne viral infec tions and other injection -
related infections. In one study, criminologists Andresen and Boyd from Simon Fraser University 
argued that, when they measured HIV infection and overdose deaths in east Vancouver, Insite 
prevented 35 new cases of HIV and approxim ately 3 deaths each year . (Andresen et al 2009)  
 
Finally, the previously cited Lancet  article indicated the appearance of the injection facility 
significantly improved public order within the surrounding community.  
 
In the later case, Kerr and his colleagu es evaluated the public order benefits from the 
Vancouver injection site by examining the period from six weeks before to 12 weeks after the 
opening of the Insite facility. They also selected 10 city blocks surrounding the facility and 
gathered data by wal king through these areas at different times on various days.  
 
The researchers identified the following in dicators of community disorder:  
 
 public injection use  
 syringes discarded in public view,  and 
 litter related to in jections such as syringe caps.  
 
Interestingly, they also used a fourth barometer – the prevalence of suspected drug dealers.  
 
Lastly, the social scientists acknowledged that police patrols in east Vancouver might impact 
local drug use; so they evaluated the law enforcement presence. However,  the study did not 
explain how the effectiveness of police patrols was measured.  
 
The researchers uncovered significant decreases in users injecting publicly, discarded syringes, 
and litter related to drug use. Moreover, they maintained that their results  bode well for 
community liveability and tourism since Insite produced improvements in public order . (Wood et 
al 2004)  
7 
  
The federal government’s Expert Advisory Committee (EAC), which produced a report for the 
Minister of Health in March 2008, also cited t his study regarding the medical and public orde r 
benefits of injection sites. The results were significant because the research influenced the 
Supreme Court of Canada decision on September 30, 2011 to order the federal government  to 
give Insite an ex emptio n under the CDSA  to continue operations.  
 
8 
 EVALUATION OF THE  METHODOLOGY  
 
Medical researchers might not be the best evaluators regarding drug dealers and illegal activity 
as compared to law enforcement officials. The Supreme Court  of Canada , however, did n ot 
make such a distinction in evaluating the methodology employed by these social scientists when 
deciding the Insite case.  
 
Left unanswered were a multitude of questions regarding how these social scientists evaluated 
crime and public order in Vancouver’ s eastside . How were researchers able to evaluate who 
was and was not a drug  dealer by simple observation? What factors did they take into account 
when making this assessment?  Did they look at clothing or individual’s  conduct on the street?  
 
These types o f questions were not addressed in the Lancet  study and were ignored by the 
Supreme Court. Even more problematic, the evidence cited by social experts to support the 
positive impacts of supervised injection sites is not convincing.  
 
Colin Mangham and his c olleagues published a 2011 article in The Journal of Global Drug 
Policy and Practice  critiquing Kerr’s study. Mangham disputed Kerr’s claim that overdose deaths 
decreased between 2001 and 2005. Instead, he argued, the original study should have 
accounted f or the greater availability of heroin in 2001,  which lead to a higher than “normal”  
number of overdose deaths in the baseline year.  
 
Mangham argued that t aking 2002 as the first year changes Kerr’s results . In fact, data from 
2002 onward  to 2005 actually i ndicated an upward trend in overdose deaths. (Pike et al 2011) 
Moreover, Mangham argued that supportive researchers should have been aware of the heroin 
criticism since some of these scientists participated in previous public discussions on that issue.  
  
Mangham also stated that  Kerr’s study failed to acknowledge tha t, since April 2003, Vancouver 
police increased deployments in the 12 -block area surrounding the Insite facility. This area is 
part of the city where the injection site is located and which saw a 35% drop in overdose deaths.  
 
The Vancouver Police Department, however, stated, “Yes, four officers per day, 22 hours per 
day, seven days a w eek, for one year from Sept ‘03  to Sept ‘ 04 in the blocks at all times with 
cell phone access directly to them by  SIS staff.”  
 
The officers were paid overtime – at double time – for the entire year. At the same time, 60 
other officers were deployed in a five -block area close to the faci lity and still are to this day.  
(Pike et al 2011) In their study, Dr. Kerr and his  colleagues stated, “…we know of no changes in 
policing policy that could have confounded our results.” (Marshal et al 2011)  
 
In published documents, the Vancouver Police Department confirmed that a complement of 
officers still patrols Vancouver ’s eastsid e.  
 
“What began as the Citywide Enforcement Team (CET) pilot project in April 2003 has turned 
into a permanent, though relatively small (approximately 56 Police Constables, four Sergeants 
and two Staff Sergeants with nine to twelve officers patrolling at any given time), group of 
dedicated officers who patrol the Downtown Eastside, mostly on foot.” (Vancouver Police 
Department , 2009)   
 
Researchers arguing in favour of the Insite supervised injection facility also did not account for 
the extra deployment o f police officers and their likely impact  on community safety. These 
factors, such as extra police officers, might have protected the community from any additional 
public disorder arising f rom the new injection facility.  
9 
 As such, one could conclude Vancouv er’s east side would have been negatively affected from 
the Insite clinic without the additional police officers.   
  
Also, Mangham suggested  that Kerr’s estimate of lives saved by the injection facility was too 
high, a finding reinforced by the European Mo nitoring Centre . (Pike et al 2011) Therefore, 
suspect methodology concerning the estimates of lives saved renders questionable claims that 
the injection facility has not hurt Vancouver ’s east side community.  
 
Simply put, any part of a community  that might host a n injection facility should demand a  
thorough and conclusive research as to how that community might be impacted – something 
existing studies have not accomplished.  
 
The Expert Advisory Committee ’s 2008 report cited three general limitations in making  a cost -
benefit analysi s for a new injection facility:  
 
1. Baseline data for the Vancouver e astside area was limited as it related to determining 
how frequent drug users injected drugs and shared needles , among other variables  
2. Longitudinal studies – the exami nation of the same indicator over years –- have not 
been published concerning injection facilities  
3. Researchers have not made a comparison between the Insite facility and other drug 
strategies, such as treatment courts and outreach pro grams, in terms of liv es saved.  
 
The failure to examine other options means researchers cannot assess Insite’s performance 
versus alternative strategies.  
 
The federal EAC then revi ewed existing research and applied  it against Insite’s stated 
objectives to determine whether  those stated goals had been achieved. The facility’s first 
objective was to increase access  to health and addiction care. To test whether the site was 
achieving its target, the Committee said any study needed to collect treatment histories, 
injection frequenc y, and needle sharing frequency of all who utilized the clinic.  
 
Although debating the medical merits of an injection facility is beyond the scope of this paper, 
an evaluation of the methodology used to collect health data is crucial because suspect 
method ology often produces unreliable results.  
 
Opening such facilities in Ontario without the benefit of reliable research exposes communities 
to potential degradation because illicit drugs are inherently harmful and are associated with high 
rates of local crim e. 
  
The EAC also criticized the supportive study’ s data based upon the self -reported inje ction 
practices of drug users. It  said a study of a comparative group would be useful in providing 
evidence as to whether the supervised injection sites have had a , “significant impact on needle 
sharing and other risk behaviours outside of the site where the vast majority of drug injections 
still take place.”  
 
In addition, the committee reviewed data showing over 8,000 drug users have injected drugs at 
Insite (2008 fi gures), and 18% of the addicts accounte d for 80% of the total visits. Of these , 
roughly 1,500 people  (less than one -in-ten) used Insite for all of their injections.  
 
More importantly, the total injections at Insite comprised less than five per cent of tota l injections 
in eastside Vancouver. Although the Committee noted the approximately 220,000 clean 
injections at Insite, the group stated that overall impact on the total number of injections in the 
eastside area was minimal.  
10 
 As well, the Vancouver Coastal H ealth Authority (VCHA), the governmental body responsible for 
Insite, calculated a reduction of total injections of 2.6% to 4.9%, a figure similar to that derived 
by the EAC. Thus, even if British Columbia boosted the number of injection sites, the overall  
impact would be minimal because addicts said they would use such facilities for less than 10% 
of all injections.  
 
The federal advisory committee also maintained that, although Insite encourages drug users to 
seek counselling and treatment, there was  no e vidence as to the facility’ s cost effectiveness 
since there has not been a study comparing an injection facility to other ways for addicts to get 
necessary help. Thus, the Committee could not reach a conclusion regarding whether Insite had 
increased user a ccess to health and addiction care.   
 
Furthermore, the EAC evaluated the facility’s impact on overdoses and concluded that it had 
saved about one life per year by intervening in such crisis situations.  
 
Since 2006, Insite’s staff has been involved in 336  overdose situations. The Com mittee stated 
that there is no “ direct evidence that SIS influence death rates and large scale and long -term, 
case controlled studies would be needed to show that SISs influence overdose death rates 
among those who use INSITE. Mathematical modelling is based on assumptions that may not 
be valid.”   
 
Indeed, these sites do save live s, statistically one annually. Those advocating for the 
introduction of supervised injection facilities should examine the evidence showing that illic it 
drugs are harmful and also review the correlation between addicts and property crime which, in 
turn, translates into greater victimization of the local community.  
 
Similarly, the federal committee noted that self -reported evidence collected from Insite  users 
and from a similar clinic in Australia indicated that needle sharing was lessened as users visited 
a supervised injection site. However, the EAC also stated, that , “(m)athematical mo delling, 
based on assumptions  about baseline rates of needle sharin g, risks of HIV transmission and 
other variables, generated very wide ranging estimates for the number of HIV cases that might 
have been prevented. The EAC was not convinced that these assumptions were entirely valid.”  
 
The federal committee  called into question whether Insite was meeting its HIV transmission 
goals. Without baseline data on needle sharing and any way of validating the claims of drug 
users on their risky behaviours, it is difficult to evaluate whether the facility cut the transmission 
of blood borne viral infections. Moreover, this begs the question whether this clinic is reducing 
harm to drug users or simply perpetuating the harm that drug users are doing to themselves.  
 
As well, Bayoumi and Zaric, researchers at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, evaluated Insite’s 
cost effectiveness. They argued that the Vancouver facility has not been “rigorously ev aluated.” 
(Bayoumi  et al 2008)  Still, Mayoumi’s and Zaric’s results led them to say that Insite was 
improving health and saving money even wh en they utilized conservative estimates.  However, 
their co sting model has been challenged.  Jarlais  et al stated that their assumptions were faulty 
regarding averted HIV transmissions and these researchers argued that, in their modelling, 
Insite was actuall y responsible for “…about 250 -350 averted infections over 10 years, albeit 
substantially fewer than the 1191 estimated by Bayoumi and Zaric.” (Jarlais et al , 2008)  
 
Indeed, different researchers cannot even agree as to how many HIV infections have been 
averted w hen using a 10 -year time frame.   
 
 
 
11 
 The EAC reporting to Health Canada argued that longitudinal studies were required to , “show 
with any certainty that INSITE is cost -effective or to show that the economic benefits exceed the 
costs.” If researchers c annot concur as to how beneficial the facility has been in reducing HIV 
rates, then claims that such clinics would not hurt communities in which they were installed are 
equally questionable.   
 
Another one of Insite’s objectives – improved public safety – was also evaluated by the federal 
EAC. The committee looked at Kerr’s research begun six weeks prior to the facility’s opening 
and concluded 12 weeks after it began accepting patients, which figured that drug users were 
injecting less in public. They also mentioned Australia and some European injection facilities 
where drug users self -reported fewer public injections. The committee concluded that, although 
there was no proof that drug -related loitering and other criminal behaviour was rising, the 
research c onducted by Kerr’s group was limited because of a variety of reasons:  
 
1. The statistic s covered a limited time period  
2. Kerr’s study did not control for other variables that could reduce drug -related activity, 
such as more syringe d rop-off boxes or police patr ols 
3. Because most injections occurred outside of the Insite facility, the clinic really did not 
have a major impact on how many syrin ges were disposed of in public, and  
4. There was no mention whether the report examined any studies correlating the number 
of drug addicts and higher rates of property and other crime in areas adjacent to the 
facility.  
 
The EAC’s evaluation of drug crime in the locality was similarly critical of supporting research.  
Although the available police data did not reveal any substanti al changes in crime rate, data 
limitations were quite notable.   
 
The Vancouver Police Department’s crime figures, for example, did not account for public 
tolerance of criminal activity and victims who simply did not report violations. Furthermore, the 
committee questioned whether the level of unreported crime and public tolerance was higher in 
the area close to the facility compared to Vancouver as a whole.  
 
The EAC also queried available drug statistics, noting figures constantly change coincidental 
with increases or decreases in law enforcement activity.  The committee stated, “…for the most 
part these crimes…are almost never reported by anyone other than police. With this in mind, it 
is perhaps safest to assume that drug crime statistics tell us very lit tle about the nature and 
extent of drug crime anywhere.” Moreover, the committee pointed out that the small sample of 
residents, local businesses, and police officers interviewed might not be statistically 
representative of the community as a whole and thu s not reflect actual opinion within the area.  
 
For all of the above reasons, the evidence used by Insite’s supporters can be considered 
questionable. Thus, the position taken by harm reduction proponents begs the question as to 
who is protecting the local community from intravenous drug users and their high -risk 
behaviours by placing such a facility in their neighbourhood.  
 
Aside from data provided by Vancouver and Australia injecting facilities, the European 
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is a European Union agency that 
collects data on drug addiction from European countries. Twenty -nine nations provided statistics 
pertaining to drug -induced deaths. Of the reported cases, 81% were male, the mean age was 
34 years -of-age, and more th an three -quarters of drug -related deaths were from opioids . 
(EMCDDA 2011)  
 
12 
 Although the statistics on drug -related deaths were listed, the EMCDDA did not provide data 
pertaining to supervised injection sites and crime in the communities surrounding these 
facilities. Data from the Netherlands, for example, lacked a detailed examination of the area 
adjacent to drug facilities and thus was difficult to interpret.  
 
The limited international data that does exist indicate s public order problems that have resulte d 
in the closure or relocation of some  injection facilities in Europe . (Poschadel et al 2002) This 
was studied by Poschadel et al and cited in the EAC report.   
 
Granted, the Canadian research conducted by Andresen and Boyd is consistent with the 
Australia n and Vancouver evaluations and concluded that the opening of the facility did not 
cause crime to increase or decrease. In fact, the EAC pointed to Andresen and Boyd’s 
examination of Vancouver police dispatch data for the seven -year period from 2000 to 200 6 that 
reached a similar conclusion. It has already been suggested, however, why such results might 
have occurred;  for example, because of an increased police presence within the community.   
 
By contrast, some European countries have seen crime increase i n areas within close proximity 
to supervised injection sites. The Canadian EAC cited Poschadel et al who reported increases 
in “drug dealing around the facility, with several of those also reporting aggressive incidents 
outside the premises, increases in p etty crime…” Thus, although published statistics related to 
Vancouver might not reveal an increase in crime, some international cases have yielded the 
opposite result.  
 
In addition, Vancouver police dispatch data have shown an increase in crime in some yea rs and 
a decrease in others. As a result, crime statistics do not yield much of a trend one way or the 
other and are probably of limited value in assessing the Vancouver experience.  Evidence 
pertaining to the general deterioration of the quality of life in  areas adjacent to the injection site, 
however, did show a clear trend. Most residents likely did not possess the financial ability to buy 
heroin or cocaine prior to the facility’s opening. Yet, they probably financed their addictions by 
committing various  crimes.  
 
We know the Insite  injection site has had a poor record in helping dru g users with their 
addictions. Users living in the area still do not possess the economic means to purchase their 
drugs. Instead, they continue to commit crimes at a similar r ate as existed prior to the facility’s 
opening. Thus, one can say that the clinic has at least maintained the status quo with respect to 
the rate of crimes committed by addicts because they simply do not possess the economic 
means to support their illegal habit.  
 
A high correlation already exists between drug users and high rates of property crime. Inspector 
Scott Thompson, who devised the operational plan when the  facility opened and presented the 
Vancouver Police Department’s position in 2008 to the fede ral Standing Committee on Health, 
stated that , “…linking the facility to crime and disorder or whether it caused crime to increase or 
even decrease is difficult because of the different variables that can affect it.” (Thompson 2011)  
13 
 SUPERVISED INJECTION SITES PERPETUATE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY  
 
Because supervised injection sites do not adequately address treatment for addicts, these users 
continue to commit crimes related to obtaining drugs. The statistics provided by the Vancouver 
Coastal Health Authority (VCH A) indicated that at least 50% of the  16,000  people living in 
Vancouver’s east side are on social assistance. In addition, a 1998 Vancouver report noted that 
75% of the residents on Vancouver’s eastside  have poverty level income.  
 
The lack of adequate inco me has resulted in many users turning to illegal activity to get the 
necessary funds to pay for their drugs.  
 
On average, cocaine users inject six times and heroin addicts four times daily. The approximate 
cost to the drug user is $100 per day. Assuming th e majority of intravenous users receive social 
assistance, they would only be able to sustain their drug habits for less than two weeks.   
 
As a result, the average addict would have no money left over for expenses such as rent or food 
and likely would  engage in petty crime for additional cash. Sex trade workers – an estimated 
38% of drug users – likely do not commit many property crimes , but are still engaged in criminal 
activity to finance their habit.   
 
Because of its lack of success in treating intrave nous drug users and ultimately helping them 
overcome their habit, the Vancouver supervised injection facility likely does not help addicts 
overcome their need to engage in illegal criminal that supports their habits . The Insite website 
contains data for 20 10 which indicates that, of the 12,236 individuals who used the facility, less 
than half, or 5,268, were referred to treatment services. There was no follow -up data on these 
individuals. But, of the 12,236 men and women who used the service in 2010, only 4 58 
participated in Insite’s detoxification program. Of those addicts, 97 detoxified at the facility 
(VCHA) . Thus, the detoxification success rate was 1.6%.   
 
In addition, Insite does not have data on that portion of the drug users who might have been 
successfully treated for their drug addictions.  
 
Similarly, international statistics on treatment referrals and their corresponding success rates is 
also lacking. Canada’s EAC cited Schu et al who said that, although referrals to other services 
are given in su pervised injection sites in Berlin , “…there is no data on the actual uptake of these 
services. ” (Schu et al 2005)  Spain and Switzerland also lacked referral figures.  
 
The Vancouver facility already has a low detoxification success rate. As well, there are  few 
statistics to support how many referrals have resulted in users getting off of drugs entirely.  Thus, 
one could conclude that the vast majority of Insite’s clients have continued to engage in various 
illegal activities in order to pay for their drug ha bits. Since most of the crime associated with 
their habits likely takes place in the areas surrounding the facility, the quality of life in 
Vancouver’s eastside neighbourhood has probably declined as a result of Insite.  
 
Generally, empirical research over the years has shown a relationship between drug 
consumption and criminal activity.   
 
Professors White and Gorman examined trends in drug use and crime by evaluating data taken 
from the United States’ Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program. This pro gram 
operates in more than 20 U.S. cities and utilizes urinalysis and self -reported data to evaluate 
recent drug use among those arrested. The professors discovered that, although the 
relationship between heroin use and property crime was largely inconsist ent, there was a 
positive correlation between cocaine and property crime.  
14 
 Moreover, they found a linkage that , “…both cocaine use and violent crime were increasing and 
decreasing in the same years.” There is an affirmative correlation between cocaine use and 
violent and property crime.  
 
The relationship between illicit drug use and crime is also acknowledged by the Vancouver 
Police Department. In 2009, the department published a document – “Project Lockstep” – in 
which they argued that, by the 1990s, the c ity had a problem with chronic offenders 
“…committing repeated offences primarily as a method of funding their drug addiction.”  
 
Furthermore, they stated that  whereas property crime has been reduced “…in all areas of 
Vancouver since the late 1990s, the re duction of break and enters (B&Es) in the DTES has not 
been as significant as that in the rest of the city. The high number of chronic offenders living in 
this area may explain, in part, the lack of reduction in break and enters in the DTES.”  Thus, 
illicit drug users likely commit property crimes to finance their illegal habit.  
  
This argument is even more convincing because government poverty data illustrates the 
economic realities faced by the majority of those living in the area of the Insite facility.  Indeed, 
public assistance simply does not provide enough money to support an illicit drug habit.   
 
Other studies have also shown a strong relationship bet ween drugs and property crime. F or 
example, research conducted by Nu rco et al 1984  indicated that  when drug addicts increased 
the frequency of their substance use, property crime increased. Similarly, when addicts cut their 
drug use, property crime fell. Furthermore, the same researchers demonstrated that criminal 
activity is “significantly greater follo wing addiction to drugs than before addiction.” (White and 
Gorman 2000)  
 
Because the Vancouver facility has done little t o reduce intravenous drug users’  dependency on 
illicit drugs, the clinic itself has maintained the status quo in regards to crimes comm itted by 
drug users. So, although the Vancouver police data shows no increase or decrease in illegal 
activity surrounding the facility, that result might be because drugs users are committing crimes 
at the same rate as prior to Insite’s start. Thus, the il legal consumption of drugs and the existing 
relationship with property crime rates likely indicates a continued deterioration in the quality of 
life in that community.  
  
An examination of heroin treatment and crime reduction by Lobmann an d Verthein  examine d 
the relationship between heroin -assisted treatment versus methadone treatment and the 
criminal activity of 1,015 individuals who participated in this German study.  
 
The objective of these scientists was to investigate whether these two treatments produce d a 
decline in criminal behaviour. They examined data a year prior to treatment and during the 
treatment year , using different data sources – drug users who provided information about their 
criminal activity and police statistics.  
 
Research previously cond ucted by Harrell on the validity of self -reporting regarding socially 
unacceptable behaviour, such as drinking and driving, shows that individuals underreport as 
much as 50% of the time. Moreover, Harrell’s research also shows that an individual’s ability to 
remember the quantity of drugs consumed or types of criminal offences committed more than 
12 months ago is limited . (Lobmann et al 2008)  
 
Since police data also tends to underestimate the actual number of crimes committed, these 
researchers strived to a chieve a “counterbalancing [of] the shortcomings of each data source.”  
(Lobmann et al 2008 ). 
 
15 
 Interestingly, experts argued that their results could be generalized to other countries and cited 
Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Spain where studies all found  a “considerable decline of 
crime related to heroin -assisted treatment.” Moreover, they argued that the Canadian 
experience should yield similar results. Vancouver police dispatch data, however, did  not 
support this supposition. As stated earlier, the poli ce dispatch numbers did not reveal an 
increase or decrease in crime to provide any meaningful interpretation of the facility’s impact.  
 
Data showing that crime did not fall could be explained by the facility’s poor record of treating 
drug addiction. Failu re to address this important aspect has maintained the status quo for 
continued criminal activity in the area . 
 
Supervised injection sites around the world have focused on the individual without adequately 
addressing the treatment component. In our experie nce, however, community safety issues 
should not be ignored when consid ering illicit substance abuse. Programs and facilities to help 
addicts should work in concert with the community and should not jeopardize neighbourhood 
safety.  
 
Vancouver’s Insite facility does not assist in improving the quality of communal life because it 
fails to address treatment or t he broader goal of prevention. In turn , the facility has negatively 
impacted the community because illicit drug users still commit crimes to finance t heir habit.  
16 
 ORGANIZED CRIME: THE BENEFICIARY  
 
Because supervised injection sites perpetuate the sale of illegal drugs, organized crime groups 
in Canada and other countries will benefit.  
 
In its 2007 World Drug Report , the United Nat ions Office on Drugs a nd Crime  examined  trends 
in world drug markets. Specifically, their report examined organized crime and transnational 
drug trafficking.  It concluded, “…nearly all transnational drug trafficking is conducted by 
organized groups.” Whereas heroin is shipped f rom Afghanistan to Russia by small crime 
organizations, cocaine that winds up in North America usually comes from Central America, 
shipped by larger crime groups.  
 
The UN body maintains that any long -term reduction in drug trafficking must be addressed at 
“…its source – the drug users.” ( World Drug Report 2007 ) Clearly, the Vancouver site has not 
been part of this strategy. The facility supplies clean needles and other drug equipment, but fails 
to address the demand for intravenous drugs, neglects any treat ment component, thus 
perpetuates illicit drug use and continued victimization of the community.  
 
At the retail end of the organized crime chain are the street gangs, which sell drugs to users.  
These low -level organizations often use violent crime and intimidation  tactics as a way of 
controlling their portion of the street trade in illegal substances. These offences include the 
“…facilitation of street level prostitution, theft, robbery, fraud, and weapons offences.” (Criminal 
Intelligence Service Canada 20 10)   
 
Moreover, these gangs often purchase and sell drugs from other criminal groups, establishing a 
link between these street vendors and more sop histicated crime organizations. British 
Columbia’s Integrated Gang Task Force (BCIGTF) investigates and pros ecutes gangs involved  
in violent criminal offences. The Force’s Superintendent has stated that  usually street gangs are 
“the soldiers for organized crime groups.” (Ross 2008)  
 
The drug trade operating in British Columbia also has links to the weapons trade , specifically so 
that domestic gangs can maintain the integrity o f their territories.  “In 2007, there were 247 gang -
related shootings in the Lower Mainland, many of them occurring in public spaces like streets, 
parks, restaurants and clubs.” (Ross 2008) B ecause the Vancouver supervised injection site 
has not achieved any meaningful results in treating drug addicts, the status quo has benefited 
street gangs and organized crime overall.  
 
Ontario is no different in the linkages between organized crime and dr ugs. Once these 
substances come in from overseas, in many cases, the Hells Angels motorcycle gang takes 
over. In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police argued that in , “…the majority of major 
shipments of cocaine we find – meaning loads of say, 20 kilos o r 60 kilos – when we peel back 
the layers we constantly find some level of involvement by the bikers. They have their hands in 
it all levels: shipment, distribution, money collection.” (Sher et al 2004)  
 
In fact, criminal investigations of Hells Angels in Ontario have shown that these bikers have 
established a drug network from west to east whereby a gang member , “…bought cocaine and 
marijuana in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland and shipped it to central Canada  east o n cars, 
buses , and airplanes.” (Sher et  al 2004)  
 
Vancouver’s eastside clinic has done nothing to counter the use of illi cit substances. Drug users 
continue to commit property crimes and other crimes to fi nance their harmful drug habit.  The 
same users then purchase their drugs at the street le vel and profits from the sale of these 
substances eventually f low up to crime organizations.  
17 
 The clinic’s failure to treat drug users so that they can live drug -free lives has helped maintain 
the economic positions of all stakeholders who benefit from the continue d consumption of illicit 
drugs.  If supervised injection sites open in Ontario, a similar pattern of community victimization 
would  arise.   
 
Insite’s current harm reduction model has not worked in Vancouver. Any introduction of similar  
facilities in to this province would be strongly opposed by Ontario’s police leaders and the 
policing community.  
18 
 CONCLUSION  
 
The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police  does not support the establishment or operation of 
injection facilities in Ontario. Illegal drugs ar e harmful and usually purchased with proceeds of 
crime. Organized crime organizations benefit  from these facilities by having ready demand for 
illicit drugs while the community loses as crime in the area where these facilities are located is 
bound to rise.  
 
Although this paper does  not have as its purpose a  study of  the potential medical benefits to 
drug users, in our view, the methods used by scientific researchers to arrive at their conclusions 
is questionable.  For example, one goal of Vancouver’s Insite facility when it opened in 2003 was 
to address the spiralling numbers of HIV/AID cases, often attributed to needle sharing and 
intravenous drug use. Many experts, however, have found limitations on data involved in 
ascertaining whether HIV/AIDS cases have in fact dropped because of the clinic’s appearance.  
 
Regarding the impact of supervised injection sites on public disorder in Vancouver , the results 
are quite debat able because other variables, such as extra police officers deployed, were not 
accounted for  in the researchers’ studies. When Fischer and Allard conducted a feasibility study 
for an injection facility in Victoria, they found that evidence concerning their impact on public 
order was mixed, and this was “...further confounded by the fact that very  little systematically 
generated and non -generalizable information is available on this issue.” (Fischer et al 2007)   
By most measures, the Vancouver facility did not save many lives, in fact, only one per year . 
 
These minimal gains must be weighed against  the deterioration in quality of life in the 
community where the facility is situated. Vancouver’s Insite has done little to reduce crime in the 
city’s eastside . Crimes  such as prostitution, break and enters, robberies , and car thefts continue 
to occur sin ce these offences finance the habits of drug users.  
 
More alarmingly, if the facility perpetuates the cycle of addiction and, in fact, lures greater 
numbers into this area  of the community,  then local crime is bound to rise.   
The sale of illicit drugs to i ntravenous drug users who vi sit a supervised injection site  will 
facilitate the continued victimization of the community, and only serve to p rofit organized crime 
groups. From March 2004 to April 2005, the success rate of Insite in helping  addicts was only  
2.7%.  
19 
 ADDENDUM  
STATISTICS RELATING TO SUPREVISIED IN JECTION SITES (SIS)  
 
 8,000 drug user s have injected drugs at Insite;  18% accounted for 80% of the total visits  
(2008 figures)  
 Less than 10% of these addicts used Insite for all of their injections  
 Total  injections at Vancouver facility comprised less than 5% of total injections in 
Downtown East side of  Vancouver

intervening in overdose situations  
 Wide ranging estimates o f number of averted HIV infections as a result of Vancouver 
facility (range from 250 -350 over 10 years versus 1191 estimated by different research 
team)  
 Vancouver Police dispatch data from 2000 -2006 cited in Health Canada report indicated 
that crime did no t increase or decrease following opening of Vancouver facility (one 
possible reason is increased police enforcement projects in area during those years; 
also approximately 50 extra officers directly assigned to close proximity to injection site)  
 A m inimum  of 50% of residents of Downtown Eastside area of Vancouver collect 
government social assistance payments ; 75% of those residents living at poverty level

People have every reason to be confused about Vancouver's supervised injection site. It's been up
and running since 2003 and has as many detractors as it has supporters. The only sure thing is the
entrenched debate about what it has accomplished, the alleged bias of the medical research, and
what goes on inside.
As former chief of the Vancouver Police, it fell on me to decide whether we should support the
continued operation of Vancouver's supervised injection site, Insite. The competing interests were
intense and no matter what one's personal views were, every comment garnered immediate rebuttal
from an expert. The addiction issues, crime concerns, and moral obligations of those in leadership
positions received continual headlines, so we learned over time to stick with what we were good at
—public safety.
The medical issues were better left to physicians. The Vancouver Police have tried to do the right
thing for all the citizens of this city within the funding provided by city hall—all under the umbrella of
never-ending suggestions that the police take an even harder line with the sad reality of what was
going on outside the front door of the site.
Background
The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) supported the opening of the supervised injection site in
2002 as a research project, not as a concept, and that support continues to this day. The Vancouver
Police letter of support to the federal health minister has been inaccurately used by harm reduction
proponents as a blanket endorsement for a wide variety of initiatives and projects surrounding the
supervised injection site (SIS).

One should remember that no matter the direction and views of the politicians at the time, our
position was straightforward—follow the law. Any injection facility for Vancouver would have to
comply with the law. We didn't hesitate to prosecute offenders and shut down illegal sites, and there
have been some.
Former Mayor Phillip Owen understood the dilemma for the police. He pursued the exemptions
under federal drug legislation to allow the SIS to open because he knew it could not run without the
cooperation of the police, especially those frontline officers who patrol the streets and alleys
nearby.
Once the exemptions were granted by the federal government, to resist or block the legal operation
of the SIS would put the police in an untenable situation—should the SIS fail, the police would be
blamed for its demise. So our role became a supportive one, waiting for the pilot project research
results, which we were promised would be complete in 2 or 3 years.
Health Minister Tony Clement has since advised the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, which
operates Insite, that their exemption under Section 56 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act
has been extended until 30 June 2008. His comments have been clear: "This extension will allow
research on how supervised injection sites affect prevention, treatment, and crime to be continued
for another 6 months."
Vancouver Coastal Health Authority brought in an independent project leader to lead the research.
There were some logistical and personnel issues and the person has not been replaced as yet.
Everyone is waiting for the results of the research.
Some say the research is in and clearly shows success while others say sympathetic evaluators,
who support open access to drugs, have overstated their positive findings of the site, downplayed or
ignored negative findings, or reported meaningless findings in order to give the overall impression
that the facility is successful.
Police in the middle
There have been many voices of complaint about the value of the SIS and the peer reviews of
certain addiction experts. There have been magazine articles, medical research, newspaper stories,
and letters to the editor all proclaiming the success of the SIS.
Then there are others who suggest the real purpose of the SIS is to use it as a foothold for the
further expansion of drug use in Canada. Medical experts (Drs Davies and Mangham) take an
educated research approach contrary to the findings of the SIS proponents.
That is our dilemma. There is a wide variety of medical opinions about what is right. The problem for
the police is that we are not medical experts and we can only read and try to follow the debate. The
Vancouver Police appointed Inspector Scott Thompson to be the lead on the debate/discussions,
and he values the Carrado/Cohen review from Simon Fraser University given their qualifications
and relative neutrality.
In the end this will be a decision of government and lawmakers. Our job will be to enforce what that
final decision turns out to be. I believe we should remain supportive of the research objectives and
the principles behind the original agreements.
Harm reduction
The supervised injection site is based on the controversial ideology of harm reduction, which views
drug use as inevitable. Thus it is suggested that the government's role is to reduce the
consequences of that choice, based on the perspective that since individuals are going to use drugs
anyway, why not enable them to do so in a safe medical environment? It is not clear to me whether
harm reduction supporters want to reduce the incidence and volume of drug use.

I give little credence to active drug users' views on how best to solve the drug problem, but I do
listen to addicts who have gotten clean. I was told once by Dr Ray Baker that the solution to curing
drug addiction is not complicated. He and his colleagues have done it for years, and successfully.
Support, treatment, abstinence, and counseling are all part of the solution.
It seems that harm reduction tries to reduce harm to the drug user while not being judgmental about
their actual drug use. This lack of judgment allows the addict to "freefall through society," as former
VPD Constable Al Arsneault once said, with addicts dropping out of school, losing jobs, being
alienated from their families, committing or being themselves victims of crime, and making them
vulnerable to disease and death. In fact, the focus of harm reduction is actually the worst-case
scenario for a drug user—total inability to quit and eventual death.
Recommendations
Abstinence
A lifetime of policing has led me to believe that getting off drugs should be the first step for addicts,
not the last. In locations where supervised sites have had positive outcomes there has been
accompanying strong support from the police and the courts for those areas surrounding the
site. This means that if an addict chooses to inject outside the SIS, there are immediate
repercussions by the police and the courts.
This is not the case in Vancouver due to the chronic police shortages and a liberal attitude toward
drug use in general. Police are naturally suspicious about the positive image of Insite. This image is
undeserved—what goes on in the SIS is abhorrent. My respect goes to the police officers assigned
to the challenging beat of District 2 in which the SIS continues to operate.
Mandatory treatment
There must be mandatory and compulsory drug treatment for addicts, especially prison inmates.
Treatment must trump individual human rights when a person's addiction causes problems. Britain
and Sweden are good examples of where tough enforcement in partnership with the courts,
treatment facilities, and rehabilitation programs really work.
Sweden has among Europe's lowest crime, disease, medical, and social problems stemming from
drug addiction, according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime in its 2006 analysis. I
would be interested in the many major European cities on record against supervised sites. Many
facilities have closed, and the reason why should be part of the research.
Education
If there is to be support of the SIS, there must be the right accompanying message of the big
picture. There must be condemnation of illegal drug use with no glamorization of the drug culture.
Educational material must be clear, pertinent, and designed to have impact.
The so-called war on drugs commentary may be dated, but the underlying message is important
and valuable. Education is the key. There must be respect for the rule of law. Use the SIS if you
must, but it is not a free ride; there are certain things you must do and you must participate in
whatever program is available and required.
Has any good come of it?
The casual observer might look at Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) and wonder if things
are better since the opening of the SIS. They are better—not a lot, but better than they were 5 years
ago. It is not entirely because of the SIS, but that may have played a small part. Police crackdown
on street level dealers and a focus on addicts who use or fix in or near parks and schools are
prosecuted, and this has made a huge difference. Enforcement works.
What is lost in many of the discussions about supervised injection sites are the uniformed officers
who patrol the areas around the sites. I am very proud of their efforts in the DTES and their

continued professionalism in the face of such heated debate and criticism from both sides. The
officers continue to do their job. There is a huge untold story here.
People have become used to thinking of the DTES as a centre for public urination and defecation,
prostitution, open sex, panhandling, drug trafficking, assaults, and violent crime. It is not fair. This is
a great neighborhood, a unique community made up of many fine, law-abiding citizens.
It was never more obvious when 40 additional officers patrolled the DTES in 2003. People walked
the street in safety, baby strollers were commonplace, and officers were stopped on the street and
thanked for their dedication to make things better.
