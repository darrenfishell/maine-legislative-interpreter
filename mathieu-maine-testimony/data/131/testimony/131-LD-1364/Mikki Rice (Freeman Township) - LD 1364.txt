I
am
here
today
in
support
of
LD
1364:
An
Act
to
Prevent
Opioid
Overdose
Deaths
by
Establishing
Safe
Consumption
Sites.
Last
year
our
fatal
overdose
rate
increased
again
to
716
people
dead
of
a
preventable
fatal
overdose.
That’s
up
from
636
the
year
before,
and
we
are
already
on
track
for
another
record
year
for
2023.
Those
are
not
just
numbers,
they
are
real
people.
They
are
parents,
grandparents,
siblings,
cousins,
friends,
and
loved
ones.
Their
lives
cut
short
all
because
of
a
continued
War
on
Drugs
mentality
which
stigmatizes,
criminalizes,
and
kills
people
who
use
substances
rather
than
using
evidence-based
harm
reduction
practices
that
meet
people
where
they
are
at
and
try
to
help
them
keep
themselves
safe
and
alive
whether
they
are
seeking
treatment
or
not.
In
February
when
the
Fatal
Overdose
report
was
released,
Governor
Mills’
office
made
the
following
statement:
“ M y
h e a r t

Over
the
last
couple
of
years
the
state
has
put
a
focus
on
getting
Recovery
Community
Centers
up
and
running.
Recovery
centers
are
great
for
people
in
recovery,
but
most
(if
not
all)
expect
you
to
be
in
recovery
or
ready
to
enter
into
recovery
to
attend
the
center.
Because
we
criminalize
substance
use,
many
people
who
are
currently
using
substances
aren’t
able
to
build
meaningful
community
connections,
which
cost
lives
and
keep
people
who
use
substances
isolated.
SCSs
are
places
where
people
who
use
drugs
(PWUD)
can
find
meaningful
connection
whether
or
not
they
want
to
seek
treatment.
We
may
only
have
2
operating
sites
in
the
U.S.
that
are
fairly
new,
but
SCS
are
not
a
new
concept
at
all.
The
first
SCS
opened
in
Switzerland
in
1986.
2
Since
then
SCS
have
been
implemented
across
over
100
sites
in
67
cities
in
11
countries
across
the
world
3
and
not
a
single
person
has
ever
died
from
an
overdose
at
a
safe
consumption
site.
Research
on
the
efficacy
of
SCS
shows
they
are
associated
with
safer
and
more
hygienic
substance
use
among
regular
clients,
decreased
overdose
mortality,
greater
access
to
medical
and
social
services,
and
reduced
public
substance
use.

According
to
the
Foundation
for
AIDS
Research
Issue
Brief:
The
Case
for
Supervised
Consumptions
Services,
“Local
and
state
governments
should
actively
explore
the
implementation
of
SCS
to
complement
existing
drug
prevention
and
treatment
interventions,
in
consultation
with
stakeholders,
including
PWUD,
affected
communities
and
businesses,
healthcare
and
addiction
treatment
professionals.
“The
evidence
is
clear
that
supervised
consumption
services
are
a
remarkably
effective
and
cost-effective
approach
to
improving
the
lives
of
people
who
use
drugs
and
the
health
and
security
of
the
communities
in
which
they
live”.
4
People
who
use
drugs
are
not
disposable,
but
the
message
that
is
sent
when
ignoring
evidence-based
practices
to
keep
doing
the
same
old
thing
that
isn’t
working
says
that
you
do
not
believe
that
they
deserve
to
live.
People
are
dying
and
we
need
to
act
now.
With
that
I
urge
you
to
look
at
the
research
and
to
vote
unanimously
Ought
to
Pass.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
all
that
you
do
for
our
great
state.
