Department of Public Safety 
Neither For Nor Against LD 1832 
“An Act to Require Reimbursement of Fees for Treatment Rendered by Public and Private 
Ambulance Services”  
Presented by Representative Cyrway of Albion 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMI TTEE ON HEALTH COVERAGE, INSURANCE 
AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Public Hearing: May 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM 
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and honorab le members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health Coverage, Insuran ce, and Financial Services: 
 My name is Sam Hurley, and I am the Director  of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety. I am testifying on behalf of Maine Department of 
Public Safety and Maine EMS neither for nor against LD 1832, “ An Act to Require 
Reimbursement of Fees for Treatment Rendere d by Public and Private Ambulance Services. ” 
 While Maine EMS wholly agrees that ther e are significant concerns with ambulance 
reimbursement. We are unsure that this legislative vehicle is the appropriate pathway to achieve 
those ends. In the 130
th Legislature, Maine EMS was direct ed to empanel a Financial Health 
Stakeholder Group who proposed se veral recommendations that we re incorporated into LD 
1602.1 We are supportive of the changes that LD  1602 will bring about in the reimbursement

 space but understand that one of the biggest hu rdles facing EMS reimbursement in the United 
States is federal policy set by the Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS).  
 Additionally, while we are immens ely appreciative of the intenti on behind this legislation, we 
have some concerns about the language included in  this bill where, “an ambulance service may 
charge the same amount as a hospital charges to  treat a person in the emergency department 
without admitting the person.”
2 As was recommended by the Financial Stakeholder group, it is 
important that we begin exploring cost reporting to better understand the true cost of EMS in the 
State of Maine.3 If you were to ask a hospital exactly how  much it cost s for them to treat a 
patient who has a non-complicated ar m fracture, I can imagine that most hospitals can detail the 
average cost almost down to the penny. In EMS,  we cannot tell you exactly how much it costs to 
manage and treat the same arm fracture if they activate the 9-1-1 system . Therefore, it seems 
premature to expect payers; public , private, and self-pay; to be  charged the same amount as 
hospitals charge without those same cost analyses. We are optim istic that the recommendations 
from the financial health comm ittee will be implemented and pr ovide some additional insight. 
That said, we are not sure that this specific piece of legislation is best at this time.  
 Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any additional que stions, comments, or concerns 
that we may be able to address. We appreciate  the opportunity to pres ent to the committee. 
 Thank you.
