The Marne Assoc1at1on of Health Plans and some of our member plans have partrcrpated 1n the 
conversatrons about the fmancral health of Emergency Medlcal Servrces and the rmportance of 
mamtalnmg access to ambulance servrces 
We apprecrate the concems of the b1ll sponsor and apprecrate the trme the commrttee has already 
spent on these rssues 
We beheve the b1ll heard prevrously by the comm1ttee, LD 1602, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Stakeholder Group Convened by the Emergency Medzcal Serv1ces' 
Board on F znanczal Health of Ambulance Servzces, also addresses thls rssue, and presents an 
opportumty to address thrs lssue 1n a more comprehensrve manner 
We are concerned wrth the prov1s1on m LD 1832 that permlts ambulance servrces to charge the 
same amount as a hosprtal would charge to treat a person m the emergency department Care 
dellvered at a response locatron 1s not equrvalent to care delrvered m a hosprtal settmg under the 
d1rect10n of a more hrghly tramed medrcal provrder 
Thank you for your consrderatron and we look forward to the work sessron on these b1lls laterm the week
