Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1832 , An Act to Require Reimbursement of Fees for Treatment Rendered by Public and 
Private Ambulance Services  
 
May 1 5, 2023  
 
 
Sen. Bailey , Rep. Perry  and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance  and Financial 
Services  Committee .  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony neither for nor 
against  LD 1832  on behalf  of the Maine Municipal Association . 
 
I am submitt ing written testimony “neither for nor aga inst” LD 1832 bec ause our policy 
committee has not yet est ablished the Association’s  official  position on the bill. However, 
considering the overwhelming need for emergency medical services in all areas of the st ate, as 
well the pressure currently placed on property  taxpayer s to fund the increasing costs of this life 
saving service, municipal officials are likely to support the concept behind the bill  when the y 
meet on May 25.  
 
Unlike law enforcement  where cou nty she riffs and the state police are available  to 
provide backup services , there is no t a state or county response unit available  to assist  when  a 
community does not have the staffing, funds, or call volume necessary to support an ambulance 
service . As a re sult, private compan ies are often  the only alternative, which  incidentally  are also 
facing similar  funding  and s taffing challenge s.  LD 1832 presents a step in the right direction  by 
requir ing a private or public am bulance service  to be reimbursed for the cost of treatment 
provided at the  scene  during an emergency  call, even if the individual  being assist ed is not 
transported  to a hospital .  Under curre nt practice , there is no required reimbursement , leaving the 
entity provid ing the service to shoulder t he costs .   
Thank you for your time and consideration.
