Re: L.D. 1373, An Act to Allow Employers to Shop for Competitive Health Plan Options by 
Expanding the Disclosure of Health Claims Information 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1373. The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background infonnation. This bill would amend the Insurance Information and Privacy 
Protection Act‘ and the Group or Blanket Health Insurance Lawz to expand the scope of loss 
information an insurer must provide to a group policyholder so that employer can shop for health 
coverage. 
This bill adds a deﬁnition for “High-cost claimant ” as an insured whose aggregate claims exceed 
$50,000 during the 12-month period preceding the request for loss information. The bill also 
speciﬁes the loss information that an insurer must disclose;3 permits an insurance contractor or 
producer in receipt of a request for loss information to transmit high-cost claimant data directly 
to another insurer or underwriter, or to a contractor or producer who has signed a business 
associate agreement with that insurer;4 directs group policyholders receiving a high-cost claimant 
report to take all precautions and actions required under the federal law regarding privacy of 
individually identiﬁable health information;5 and prohibits an insurer in receipt of a disclosure 
request from transmitting high-cost claimant data to any group policyholder that is not in 
compliance with the statute. 
‘24-A M.R.S. §§ 2201 — 2220. 
2 24-A M.R.S. §§ 2801 -- 2847-W. 
3 
The information to be shared includes a minimum of24 months of claims data (unless the policyholder has not 
been insured for that length of time), the loss ratio by month (with medical and pharmacy claims being identiﬁed), 
high-cost claimant reports (including an estimate for anticipated claim cost for the 12-month period immediately 
following the request), and a statement describing precertification requests for hospital stays of 5 days or longer 
made during the 30-day period preceding the date of the report request. 
4 
The information may be shared to such individuals for the purpose of securing quotes, developing actuarial reports, 
facilitating claim management or other activities related to quoting or managing the group health plan sponsored by 
the requesting group policyholder.

While we do not take a position on the other changes that the bill would make, we are concerned 
about the disclosure to employers of personal health information (PHI) on employees and family 
members who are high-cost claimants, including their diagnosis and prognosis for the following 
12 months. Even though insurers are not required to provide loss information to small groups 
(with 50 or fewer lives), this PHI could easily identify a speciﬁc employee at a mid-size ﬁrm. 
Moreover, enforcing the requirement that the policyholder take precautions to safeguard this PHI 
falls outside the Bureau’s jurisdiction. We question whether the value of providing this 
information directly to the policyholder outweighs the risks to the privacy of the covered 
employees and dependents. 
l hope this information is useful to the Committee. Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely,
