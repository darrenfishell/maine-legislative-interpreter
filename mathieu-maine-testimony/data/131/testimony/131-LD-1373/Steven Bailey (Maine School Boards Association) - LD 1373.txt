 TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1373  
 
AN ACT TO ALLOW EMPL OYERS TO SHOP FOR COMPETITIVE  
HEALTH PLAN OPTIONS BY EXPANDING THE DISCLOSURE  
OF HEALTH CLAIMS INFORMATION  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Health Cover-
age, Insurance and Financial Services. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine 
School Boards Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine 
School Boards Association, in support of L.D. 1373.  
 
This bill would allow employers, which in our case are school districts, to get detailed 
claims information from their current insurance carrier so they can get competitive quotes 
for coverage.  
 
Salaries and benefits, including health insurance coverage, represent a significant portion 
of the local school budget.  
 
Under current law, incumbent carriers, which in the case of most public school districts is 
the MEA Benefits Trust, are not required to release that information. Instead what is pro-
vided, in the aggregate, is the percentage of claim dollars paid out versus the premium 
dollars collected, or loss ratios.  
 
That is not enough information for other insurance carriers to make a competitive bid.  
 
In consulting with our insurance advisor on this bill, her recommendations would be:  
1. Add number of covered members to the definition of loss information.  
2. In paragraph 2A(1) replace “claims data ’ with “loss information ” so that the 
amount of premium paid and number of members is also provided for 24 months, 
and in paragraph 2A(2) replace “loss ratio ” with “loss information ” so premium 
paid and covered members is also provided each month.  
3. 21 business days is quite long. I would suggest 10 or 12 business days.  
 
School board members working with their superintendents believe it is important to spend 
local property taxpayer dollars wisely in order to keep the community support we current-
ly enjoy when it comes to passing school budgets. Competitive bidding on health insur-
ance would underscore that commitment.  
 
We would add that it ’s not just the employer who benefits from competitive insurance 
pricing. The employee does as well.
