Testimony of Dan Demeritt — 4/20/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
Neither For Nor Against LD 1373 
An Act to Allow Employers to Shop for Competitive Health Plan 
Options by Expanding the Disclosure of Health Claims Information 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-profit insurance caniers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
This bill requires certain information be shared with employers or another insurer or underwriter 
or a contractor or a producer for the purpose of shopping for health insurance. We offer 
suggestions for your consideration. 
0 Monthly loss ratio reports with medical and pharmacy claims identified individually is 
excessive. We understand the desire to assess and analyze trends but monthly is more 
frequent than necessary. We would suggest quarterly reports. 
0 Prognosis information is not something a can'ier would have. Primary diagnosis could be 
available but not prognosis. 
0 Requiring reports on all precertification requests for hospital stays of 5 days or more is 
beyond What a carrier would typically provide and is administratively burdensome. 
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.
