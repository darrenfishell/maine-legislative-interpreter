LD 1483
Testimony in Support of LD 1483 “An Act to Protect the Rights of Agricultural 
Workers”
April 16, 2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing,
My name is Adrienne Horne, I am a resident of Appleton, and I am writing to you to 
share my support for LD 1483 and the effort to protect farm worker access to health 
care and housing.
I support this bill because I believe all Maine workers should have the right to access 
healthcare and feel safe in their own house. The fact that farm workers do not have 
these same rights that most other Maine workers have highlights the inequities we 
must correct in our current laws. No one should be limited from receiving medical 
care, and no one should be barred from their own housing. I want to live in a 
community where my neighbors are not threatened by their employers, but are instead
a part of a healthy, safe workforce.
Thank you for considering my testimony and for all the work you do. I hope you join 
me in support of LD 398.
Sincerely,
Adrienne Horne
