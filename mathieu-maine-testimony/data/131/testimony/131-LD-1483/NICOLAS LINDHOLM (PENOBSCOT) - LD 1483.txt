PENOBSCOT
LD 1483
I am an organic wild blueberry farmer, certified by MOFGA since 1996, with a 
seasonal full-time crew of 12-16 people that harvest and process 25,000-35,000 lbs. of
fresh-pack and frozen berries. My wife and I own and lease seven wild blueberry 
fields across five towns in the Blue Hill area, and sell much of our crop 
direct-to-consumer from our farm, with the balance being sold to Merrillâ€™s freezer in 
Hancock. We are also now constructing a new wild blueberry processing/freezing 
facility in North Penobscot, where we will be expanding our business to process and 
market berries from other organic growers across the state, adding more year-round 
employment opportunities in our community.  We support LD 1483, as it is a basic 
proposal for human rights and self determination.  No worker, particularly those 
engaged in producing our nation's food, whether full-time, part-time, seasonal or 
temporary, should be blocked from accessing basic services for their health and 
well-being.  We support efforts to create a level playing field where agricultural 
employment is held and seen in the same legal, social, cultural and economic 
standards as all other employment opportunities in our state.  Thank you.
