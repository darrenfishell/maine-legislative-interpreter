An Act to Protect the Rights of Agricultural Workers 
Good afternoon Senator Tipping. Representative Roeder and the other members 
of the Committee on Labor and Housing. 
I’m testifying against LD 1483  
I have concerns with section 3 of this bill. I use workers contracted through the 
H2A program and house them in a mobile home. They share these 
accommodations and for the most part live well together. 
 My concern is should the event occur that a worker allows individuals to enter 
the housing that jeopardized the wellbeing and or harmony of the other I would 
not have any recourse to help in correcting the issue. I think that is wrong. 
Please send this bill forward with an Ought Not to Pass recommendation. 
 
Respectfully, 
 Eric Seaman
