MOFGA Testimony In Support Of 
LD 1483 - An Act to Protect the Rights of Agricultural Workers 
April 18, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the ]oint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing. My name is Heather Spalding and I am deputy director of the Maine Organic Farmers 
and Gardeners Association (MOFGA). I am speaking in support of LD 1483 — An Act to Protect the Rights of 
Agricultural Workers. 
A broad-based community, MOFGA is creating a food system that is healthy and fair for all of us. Through 
education, training and advocacy, we are helping farmers thrive, making more local, organic food available 
and building sustainable communities. MOFGA certifies 535 organic farms and processing operations 
representing roughly $90 million in sales and we are working hard to create opportunities for Maine's next 
generation of farmers. Each of these farmers is a Maine businessperson for whom economic health and 
environmental health are interdependent. 
We are advocating for reform of farm labor laws at the national and state level, including ensuring that a farm 
worker is eligible for minimum wage and overtime compensation, has a protected right to organize and 
bargain collectively with am employer, and has assurance that the employer may not interfere with reasonable 
access to key service providers on the farm or with visitors to the worker's living space. 
LD 1483 addresses the basic human need for support and interaction with family and friends. 
MOFGA is striving to create an agriculture where farmers are helping mitigate climate change while makinga 
good living that allows them to support their families and our communities. We are working to build a future 
where every Maine child, regardless of race, religion, gender identity, geography or socioeconomic status 
comes home to plenty of healthy local, organic food. This will only happen if Maine's agricultural workers are 
held in high esteem and afforded the dignity and support that they need to thrive. 
Thank you very much and I would be happy to answer questions if you have any.

The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA) started in 1971 and is the oldest and largest state 
organic organization in the country. We're a broad-based community that educates about and advocates for organic 
agriculture, illuminating its interdependence with a healthy environment, local food production, and thriving 
communities. We have 15,000 members, we certify more than 500 organic farms and processing facilities representing 
$90 million in sales, and we are working hard to provide training and create opportunities for Maine's next generation of 
farmers. Each of these farmers is a Maine businessperson for whom economic health and environmental health are 
interdependent. While MOFGA envisions a future of healthy ecosystems, communities, people and economies sustained 
by the practices of organic agriculture, we attribute our success to collaboration and outreach to growers across the 
management spectrum.
