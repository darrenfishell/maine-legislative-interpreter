Hello, my name is Anna Libby and I am a resident of the town of Mount Vernon. I 
support these farm labor bills and was not intending to speak today but I am here to 
read comments from a farm worker who was in the waiting room but had to leave.
 
My name is Rocael Poz
Am a worker here in the state of Maine,
I wanted to share my experience as a worker here in Maine;  When it comes to 
housing, there is very little dignity especially as a worker, you work 12 hrs per day, 
and have to come back to a house infested with bedbugs, cockroaches, mice and other
insects.  We already have told the farmers about the conditions, but for a long time he 
has done nothing about it. 
 
We cannot leave our food outside because these insects will get on the food and we 
have an experience of getting sick, if you get sick you have to work, if you take the 
day off that will come out of your paycheck.  
Maine needs to do something to ensure the people that are milking cows to put milk 
on your tables , we need protections and we need housing with dignity.  
Also I have been working here in the same farm for over 4 yrs, to this date I have 
never received a wage raise, bonus for milk quality but our boss is benefiting from 
our hard work while we leave with bedbugs.  
One a Sunday evening two yrs ago,  I got kicked by a cow, I was hit so hard to it bent 
my hand, it was almost broken, the farmer saw what happened, but he did not stopped
to ask me if I was ok, or to take me to the doctor, there was no emergency kit, so I had
to take pain killers and my only option was to get back to work ignore the pain I was 
feeling, got back to work because cows are not going to milk themselves, so please 
ask you to direct your eyes to dairy farm workers, the people who maintain such an 
important part of this economy, the dairy industry. 
Thank you very much for your thoughtful consideration of these bills.
