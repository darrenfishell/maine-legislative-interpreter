I strongly urge the Maine State Legislature to support and pass LD 586.This bill would provide the much needed protection of the coastal salt and fresh waters that have supported Maine’s world-renowned strong and vibrant ﬁsheries for centuries.Why in the world, with the environmental collapse that is happening on our planet, would we not want to take EVERY PRECAUTION to thoroughly study, understand and regulate these RAS ﬁn-ﬁsh “farms”?We in Maine need to be the stewards of our land and our waters. Passing this bill is key to protecting and preserving what we possibly can and MUST for the environment. The people who depend on Maine’s coastal lands and waters for their livelihoods are at tremendous risk if our state’s regulatory process is not fully informed, educated and adhering to the protective measures and laws that beneﬁt the planet and ALL BEINGS.Please, please pass LD 586.Conny HatchBelfast
