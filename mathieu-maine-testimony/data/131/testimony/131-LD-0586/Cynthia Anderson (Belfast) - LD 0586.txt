I support LD586
All aquaculture is not alike-- some forms can cause major environmental damage; 
other forms can actually improve the environment.
I routinely read about environmental disasters  at aquaculture installations. We can 
not expect the aquaculture industry to regulate itself.
I would like our state to promote non-polluting forms of aquaculture, and robustly protect our 
citizens from the harm caused by weak regulation of aquaculture.
