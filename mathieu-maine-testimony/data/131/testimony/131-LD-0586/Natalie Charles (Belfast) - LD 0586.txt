LD 586
I support LD 586 to protect our waters and air.  This bill will ensure that feed will not contain 
damaging marine organisms, pollutants, and contaminants.  Further, the DMR must make 
sure that these operations will not harm our lobster, shellfish, seaweed, fin fish, and other 
operations. 
Thank you.
