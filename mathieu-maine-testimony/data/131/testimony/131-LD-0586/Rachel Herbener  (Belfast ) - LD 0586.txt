Please support LD 586 "An act to Protect Maine Fisheries".
Every day there is an environmental catastrophe and most are preventable.  In February 
there was the toxic East Palestine train derailment.  Also in February a 500,000 crude oil spill 
from the Keystone Pipeline. Clearly the corporations responsible for these disasters can not 
or choose not to prioritize safety.  This is why citizens must depend on our government to 
safeguard our future.
I support locally owned non-polluting aquaculture.  It provides healthy food and a 
healthy local economy.  Massive, foreign-owned fish factories are quite another 
matter.  What is the benefit for Mainers?  These operations spew warm, nitrogen rich 
effluent into our fragile ocean.  The amount of electricity (and backup coal 
generators) will make it tremendously difficult if not impossible for Maine to reduce 
our CO2 emissions.  Most of the fish will be shipped out of state, salmon is too pricey
for most Mainers. Profits will also be shipped out of the state, indeed out of the U.S.  
As for jobs - we risk losing jobs, not gaining.  The fish factory operations are highly 
mechanized so few jobs will be provided.  Established working waterfront operations 
(lobster, shellfish,  seaweed and plankton) cannot survive if we pollute and heat the 
ocean shoreline.
Please look at the big picture for Maine and the planet.
Thank-you.
Sincerely,
Rachel Herbener
