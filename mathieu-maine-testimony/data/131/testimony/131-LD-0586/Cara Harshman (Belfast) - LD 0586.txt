LD 586
I moved to Maine in 2020 to put down roots and start a family. The miles and miles of
beautiful, pristine coastline and all that it offers brought me here. The land-based 
industrial aquaculture projects, if left unregulated as they are today, will ruin that 
pristine coastline and create a dismal future for me and other young ocean-loving 
families. Please support LD 586 and Protect Maine Fisheries from the Effects of 
Industrial Recirculating Aquaculture. 
I urge you to support this bill because it's a win-win-win: win for the aquaculture 
industry, win for the environment, and win for Mainers who recreate on the ocean and
the Mainers who work in the fisheries. The bill keeps the aquaculture practices 
cleaner, which is better for the employees who work there and the consumers who 
buy the fish. The environment is in dire straights. It's unthinkable to blatantly allow 
new industry to knowingly adds millions of gallons of wastewater into our clean 
waters. Futhermore, at the current rate, if this bill does not pass, we risk not meeting 
our important Greenhouse emission targets. 
Maine's reputation in the country as a resilient, climate conscious state is in jeopardy 
with the influx of dirty aquaculture. Please, for the future Mainers yet to be born, the 
sacred waters and our planet, pass this bill to put smart boundaries on industrial 
aquaculture.
