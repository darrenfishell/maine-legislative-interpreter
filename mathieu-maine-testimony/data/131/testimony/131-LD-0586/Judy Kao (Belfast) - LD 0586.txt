LD 586
The bill before you, LD 586, is needed to protect Maine Coastal water quality, air quality and 
to help reduce the State's overall carbon emissions.
I urge the Department to do all it can to ensure that industrial recirculating 
aquaculture operations DO NOT adversely impact native lobster, shellfish, seaweed 
or fin-fish operations.
As I understand it, this bill clearly supports the purpose of your department.
