LD 586
Here in Hancock, I, a sea kayak guide service operator, County Soil and Water Conservation District 
Supervisor, and elected planning board member am testifying as a citizen. I am wary of Heartland 
LLC's (an out-of-state consultancy company looking for aquaculture development siting's in Maine) 
asking Maine and Company 
https://maineco.org/about-us/executive-board-members-of-the-corporation/   to list Hancock as a 
desirable location for industrial aquaculture in a published list in the Quietside Journal article "State 
peddling coastal towns to fish farms without local officials' knowledge."  This added to the DEP's 
denial of a public hearing on American Aquafarms' wastewater treatment permit application is a slap in
the face to our town regarding at least in-water finfish aquaculture.  No wonder Hancock voted at town 
meeting to intervene in this most egregious threat to our water quality, habitat, and livelihoods in 
marine harvesting.  Municipalities have Home Rule rights to regulate harvesting within their municipal
boundaries.  My neighbors welcome small farmers to develop under 10-acre sites in the water.   LD 
586 is sorely needed to begin correcting and averting the threat of unchecked industrial aquaculture 
development discharging into our pristine waters adjacent to Acadia National Park. I urge the Marine 
Resources Committee to reinsert in-water aquaculture to the bill, and vote Ought to Pass on it.  Thank 
you.
