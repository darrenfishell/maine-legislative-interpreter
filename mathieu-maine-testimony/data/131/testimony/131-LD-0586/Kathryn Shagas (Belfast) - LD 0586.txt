Re: Testimony in Support of L.D. 586
Senators and Representatives, 
I urge you to vote “yes” on L.D. 586, An Act to Protect Maine Fisheries from the 
Effects of Industrial Recirculating Aquaculture Operations. Our fisheries and our 
tourist industry depend on Maine’s reputation for clean water. Facilities in Florida and
Denmark had multiple mass die-offs and a fire that released toxic chemicals. Investors
in facilities with similar discharge technology are having second thoughts about the 
viability of these facilities as well as the costs to the natural and business 
environment. Maine can do better.
Thank you.
