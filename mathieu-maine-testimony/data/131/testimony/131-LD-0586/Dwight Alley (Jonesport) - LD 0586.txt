Dwight Alley
Jonesport
LD 586
Thank you for the time to speak Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and the 
members of the Committee on Marine Resources.
I’m Dwight Alley - a life-long resident of Jonesport. I served as a Selectman in 
Jonesport for 12 years.
I am testifying in opposition of LD 586.
This bill is bad business for Maine. It is singling out one industry – land based 
aquaculture and is undermining the authority of the Maine DEP and DMR by setting 
arbitrary standards. 
It is my belief that it’s legislation pushed by well-funded consultants and wealthy land
owners, who have failed in their numerous attempts to stop a fully-permitted project 
in our community, Kingfish Maine.
The opponents have appealed both local and state permits.
On the local side, the opponents, led by summer residents of Roque Island, tried to 
appeal the Jonesport Planning Board’s approval of the Kingfish building permit. That 
appeal was unanimously denied by Jonesport Board of Appeals.
At the state level, the opponents attempted to appeal Kingfish’s NRPA/SLODA 
permits. That appeal was denied unanimously by the BEP.
Our residents want land based aquaculture. Jonesport voted down an aquaculture 
moratorium by a 2-1 margin last year.
The opponents will stop at nothing and this bill is their latest attempt to undermine the
will of the people in the town of Jonesport.
We want local control of economic development to our community and region.
Don’t let special interest groups undermine agencies such as the Maine DEP and 
Department of Marine Resources.
Thank you for your consideration.
