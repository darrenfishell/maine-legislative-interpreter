I support LD586.
I have been following the Nordic Aquafarm proposal to build an industrial salmon aquaculture 
facility in Belfast since it was announced.
The scale and the environmental impacts of of such a facility would be huge, greatly 
detrimental to our coastal ecosystem, and impossible to redress in our lifetime. The fact that 
the City of Belfast government ever considered such a project is frightening, and highlights 
the need for regulation for such polluting industrial proposals.
Many small scale aquaculture initiatives are in process, funded by local people with a 
sense of what constitutes sustainable culture. Historically we have had great harvests 
of species that were acclimated to our waters. 
Industrial scale development would harm the resurgence of our naturally developed 
fisheries.
Thank you for your attention,
