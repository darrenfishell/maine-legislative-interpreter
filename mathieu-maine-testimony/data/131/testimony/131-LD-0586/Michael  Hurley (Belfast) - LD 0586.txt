Regarding LD 586
I am writing to state my opposition to LD 586. Very simply it has been written to destroy 
aquaculture in Maine. That its' purpose and intention. Maine and the USA government 
already does an excellent job regulating aquaculture. If anything it does almost too much. I 
hope the committee will recommend "ought not to pass."  While I am a Belfast City Councilor 
who has endured 5 years of the RAS debate and  understand  both the technology and the 
intent of the legislation I am writing as an individual. Thank you for your work.  Yours truly; 
Michael Hurley Belfast, Maine
