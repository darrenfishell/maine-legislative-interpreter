LD 586
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources:
I apologize for being late to submit testimony on Bill 586, but did not realize in time the 
hearing was on the March 16 and feel this bill is so critically necessary that I felt it important 
to at least try and be part of the public recod. 
I live in Swanville and have been part of a 5 year process that unhappily has become 
quite divisive in Waldo County, to first examine and question, and ultimately oppose, 
the application for Nordic Aquafarms here in Belfast. I did not start out opposed, but 
in doing hours of research and realizing that one of the reasons that this Norwegian 
company was in our area was because there are few requirements, restrictions, or 
regulation on Aquaculture here in Maine--Eric Heim himself, told me that coming to 
Maine meant far less financial costs for licensing or burdensome regulations than was 
required  Norway. Unhappily, we had to scramble to try to make informed decisions, 
which must include and prioritize the effects of RAS to our waters and our 
environment. As so many of us in Maine are aware, our beautiful Bay , our access to 
clean waters, our beautiful environment are our richest assets both culturally and 
economically. This bill would have been such a welcome asset to our region's 
decision making process about this project!
If LD 586 is passed, we will have a standard for our waters that makes sense both for 
now, and all future generations. I believe the climate studies are showing us that we 
are running out of time, and all our decisions about development MUST take the 
environmental impact on beautiful Penobscot Bay, and our rivers into account. This 
Bill is a good beginning for a reasonable and sustainable  local  Aquaculture industry. 
Please vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your attention. Meredith Bruskin, FNP
