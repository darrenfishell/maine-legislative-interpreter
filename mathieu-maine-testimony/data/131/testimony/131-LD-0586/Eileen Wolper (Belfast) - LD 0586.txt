LD 586
I write in support of LD 586 “An Act to Protect Maine Fisheries”. I believe it helps 
provide a much needed foundation regarding sustainable and nonpolluting 
aquaculture.
My personal perspective on this foundational need is based upon the divisive damage 
done to my community by a proposed concentrated animal feedlot/slaughterhouse in 
Belfast. I attended many, many hours of public meetings.  Time after time, 
environmental concerns of citizens were minimized. Worst of all, adherence to the 
Clean Water Act was compromised, in favor of “economics” and the stated belief that
the excuse “best technology at that time”  trumped actual protection of Belfast Bay. 
There was not adequate baseline protection in place during those proceedings.
 If the Clean Water Act stipulates that there should be no environmental impact on 
receiving waters, then the best technology would point to Zero Effluent. Why ISN’T 
Zero Effluent technology the standard? 
We all share societal, economic and environmental consequences when our ocean is 
assaulted by daily continued discharge of Nitrogen and other waste products. 
Removing this fish factory pollution threat reduces conflict in the public use of our 
ocean water and preserves benefit for the many.
Much thought has gone into LD 586. It is a positive step for sustainable industry. 
Please support it.
