This bill creates standards that no other industry in Maine is required to uphold, and 
indeed, no other method of food production. It is clearly an intentional attempt to 
make land-based aquaculture impossible in our great state. This type of protein 
production is already active in places like New York, Wisconsin, & Florida with 
projects planned or in construction in numerous other states. The provisions in this 
bill will bar Maine from being able to contribute to the contribution to domestic, 
healthy food production using one of the most efficient methods at our disposal.
