LD 586
Hello my name is Ryan Saul of Phippsburg, I am currently an owner of a small scale 
oyster farm and manage another small farm in Damariscotta. I have lived in Maine for
10 years attending a state school and stayed in the state for aquaculture. This growing 
and profitable industry is good for Maine economically and environmentally. I am 
attesting that Bill LD 586 is bad for this industry as a whole and therefore bad for our 
state. 
This bill  LD 586 aims to put restrictions on oyster seed hatcheries and would 
potentially cripple our industry being that they are the foundation of it. Seed 
hatcheries allow oyster farmers to produce oysters at a profitable scale and without 
them we are not able to plan the amount of product to expect in the future. One bad 
year of attempting to collect spat could put a farm out of business and take away jobs 
from young Mainers such as myself. 
Our farm in the near future plans to create a facility to help us grow and create jobs. 
The zero impact mandate holds us at an impossible standard that no wastewater 
treatment plants in the state have to follow. There are already ME DEP standards for 
discharge and impact that are in place for us to follow and are stringent. 
I oppose this bill based on the fact that it will create unrealistic standards that other 
industries do not have to follow, and could ruin the progress of our economically and 
environmentally sound industry that our state needs!
