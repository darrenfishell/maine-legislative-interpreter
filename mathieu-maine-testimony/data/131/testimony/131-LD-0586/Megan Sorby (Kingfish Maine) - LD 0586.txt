 Background  
Kingfish  Maine, was issued a Maine Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (MEPDES) Permit  
#ME0037559 and Maine Waste Discharge License (WDL) ( W009238 -6F-A-N) on June 25, 2021,  for a 
proposed land -based aquaculture project in Jonesport, Maine. Sp ecial Condition H of these approvals 
requires that Kingfish  Maine, starting in 2022, monitor ambient water quality both prior to and continuing 
through the buildout and operation of the permitted facility. This effort will significantly increase the 
ambien t water quality dataset for Chandler Bay, as  little background water quality data  has been collected 
prior to this effort . The pre -buildout ambient monitoring will provide an assessment of the background 
nutrient levels of the ambient waters surrounding and expected to be affected by the facility outflow.  
This document describes the Ambient Water Quality Monitoring Plan (AW QMP)  which will be conducted 
to fulfill th e permit requirement.

 Ambient Water Quality Monitoring Plan  Overview  
 
Stations:  
The University of Maine team will sample ambient water quality at a minimum of 4  pre-determined 
stations designated by Maine DEP ( Figure 1 , Table 1) . Stations established in the MEPDES permit are 
shown on the map in Figure 1.  One station (R1-3) is a previously established ambient  monitoring station 
and is located off Chandler Bay. Station 1 is located near Great Bar. Station 2 is located near Bar Island, 
Station 3, off the southwest shore of Ballast Island Ledge , near the proposed outfall , and Station 4 is near 
Bay Ledge.  These sites will be monitored in the same order on each sampli ng date; Station 4 will be 
sampled first, then Station 3, 2 and 1 in that order. These station s may be altered by MEDEP before the 
start of the 2022 sampling season. If so, this AWQMP  will be updated to reflect the changes.

 Time of Samplin g 
The stations will be sampled at 3-week intervals beginning in May of 2022 and extending through 
October , 2022.   Each sampling  will occur on the second half of alternating ebb and flood tides  within a  
four‐hour sampling window , including 1 hour of slack  , ideally during morning hours . Kingfish  Maine or 
the University of Maine (UM) team will provide for a vessel and captain for the sampling trips.  For schedule 
of planned sampling dates, see Table 2. For Field Data Sheet, see Appendix F.

Table 2. Planned primary and backup sampling dates for 2022 ambient monitoring . The samplings are scheduled to 
alternate the 4 -hour sampling window between the 2nd half of ebb and flo od tides. Every effort will be made to 
maintain the sampling schedule. In the event of a major weather event or other circumstance which would prevent 
sampling on both the scheduled date and the backup date, staff of UM will consult with Angela Brewer before  
scheduling an alternate date.   
 
Parameters measured  
Temperature, depth, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll  in situ  fluorescence , and turbidity  will be 
measured by multiparameter sonde. Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Total Phosphorus (TP), Nitrate plus 
Nitrite (NOx) and extracted chlorophyll a and phaeopigment samples will be collected as grab samples 
and will be analyzed in the Marine Water Quality Laboratory  (MWQL)  at the Darling Marine Center  (DMC) 
which is accredited by the State of Main e to perform the above laboratory analyses. If, for any reason, the 
MWQL is unable to analyze the samples, they will be transferred to a laboratory that is also accredited by 
the State of Maine for the required analysis. The sum of TKN and NOx will provide  a measure of Total 
Nitrogen (TN). A Secchi measurement of water clarity will also be made at each station. For specific SOPs 
of analytical methods, see Appendix B, C and D.  For secchi depth SOP, see Appendix G. 
 
Reporting  Summary  
Prior to December 31st of 2022, Kingfish  Maine will submit a report prepared by the University of Maine 
team and Kingfish Maine to MEDEP . The report  will present the sample data and supporting documents 
as well as a narrative of results noting any trends or patterns in the data . Grab sample data  will be 
submitted via EDD format to Angela Brewer for review  as well as sonde data, notes of field and weather 
conditions, total water depth at each site at the time of sampling in Excel format.

 Sampling Methods  
Sampling method s will follow established SOPs ( See Appendices) . New SOPs will be developed and 
appended as necessary. Deviations from or amendments to existing SOPs will be identified in the required 
annual reports, along with justification for such changes.  
 
Preparation for sampling  
Sonde Calibration  
Prior to and within 24 hours of deployment, the multiparameter sonde will be calibrated following the 
procedure in Appendix A.  Multiple back -up sondes are available for use should the dedicated instrument 
require service. If a back -up sonde is needed due to malfunction of the primary instrument, a similar 
procedure will be followed based on the manufacturer’s protocol for the model  of sonde that is used and 
may vary slightly due to differences in manufacturer’s instructions for calibration. Any deviations from the 
SOP for sonde calibration presented here, in the instance of the use of a back -up sonde , will be noted in 
the annual rep ort.  
Labware preparation  for TKN, TP , NOx,  and chlorophyll a samples  
For TKN. TP and NOx, g rab sample bottles and caps, tubes  and caps , syringes and plungers wi ll be acid 
washed, rinsed with milliQ water (> 18.0 megohm resistivity)  and dried .  Preservative (sulfuric acid) will 
be added to the sample vessels  for TKN, TP and NOx in the laboratory , prior to sampling. Extracted 
chlorophyll samples will be collected in brown, HDPE or LDPE bottles which have been cleaned with 
Sparkleen, a general use  laboratory cleaner , and rinsed a minimum of 6 times with milliQ  water . Cleaning 
procedures for all labware are documented in the laboratory records. Coolers will be cleaned and dried . 
Sample bottles and tubes will be labeled with the project name, station name or #, depth (surface (S) , just 
below thermocline (T), bottom (B)), date, analyte,  and the samplers initials.  
Enroute to the site, ice will be purchased for coolers to maintain the proper temperature of the samples.  
 
Sonde profiles  
Instrumentation  
 The University of Maine will provide an experienced technician to conduct sonde profiles and collect grab 
samples for each sampl ing. A  UM owned YSI EXO  II multiparameter sonde with handheld computer for 
user manipulation of settings, param eter readouts, data logging and display , SN: 20E101357, will be used 
for profiles of water column parameters. The YSI EXO II is equipped with the following sensors  (QC

 Profile Details:  
At each site, the sonde will be submerged and allowed to equilibrate at approximately 1 meter depth. The 
sonde will then be raised to just below the surface to begin the profile. Measureme nts will be taken at 
the following depths at each site, allowing the readings to stabilize a minimum of 2 minutes at each depth 
sampled:  
• 0.1 meters (just below surface),  
• 0.5 meters  
• 1 meter followed by 1-meter  increments to 10 meters total depth.  
• At depths greater than 10 meters measurements will be taken in 2-meter  increments  to a total 
depth of 20 meters or within 2 meters of the bottom.  
• If the water column is very shallow at a station, data may be recorded in 0.5 -meter increments 
instead of 1 -meter increments to provide more data points.  
Care will be taken not to disturb the bottom, as resuspended sediment can interfere with readings and 
the sonde can be damaged if it contacts the bottom. A weight w ill be attached to sonde line and will hang 
below the sonde to provide an indicator of proximity to the bottom by touching the substrate before the 
sonde. Total depth at the station will be determined by the boat depth finder.  
Sonde d ata will be saved in real time on the attached handheld control.  Each profile will have its own file 
and be labelled with the station name,  date and time.  All readings will be taken on the descent of the 
sonde.  A field log will record weather conditions , sea conditions, sampling personnel , sample time  and 
will provide an independent verification of the time , as well as any unusual circumstances surrounding 
the station sampling. In the lab, environmental as well as calibration data will be uploaded on a M WQL 
computer using YSI KOR  or similar software, to be eventually manipulated in Microsoft Excel or other 
spreadsheet software.  
 
Grab Sample Collection  
 
Equipment  
A weighted 4 -liter HDPE Niskin bottle with a metered nylon line and tripping weight will be used for 
collecting grab samples.  
Niskin preparation  
The niskin bottle will be rinsed with milliQ water after use and will be stored dry in the lab. The bottle will 
be rinsed with ambient water before samples are collected . 
 
Depth of Sampling  
The Field Data Sheet will be used to record sampling related data and conditions (see Appendix F). Samples  
will be collected at 1  m and at 0.5-2  meters  above  the bottom. The goal is to sample 0.5 meter s from the 
bottom, but in rough seas where it is difficult to maintain that distance, samples may be taken at up to 2 
meters above the bottom to prevent the bottle from coming in contact with the bottom  or with 
resuspended sediment directly above the bottom.  At stations with a bottom depth of more than 20 
meters, bottom samples will be taken at 20 meters.  The actual depths that the surface and bottom 
samples were taken will be recorded on the field data sheet.  In addition to surface and near bottom 
samples, if a thermocline is observed in the sonde samples, a grab sample will also be taken just below 
the thermocline. The thermocline for the purposes of this plan is defined as a drop of more than one 
degree Centigrade in temperature from one meter to the next.  This grab sample will be labelled depth 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
8 
 “T” and the actual depth will be recorded in the field data sheet. The thermocline sample will be 
analyzed for the same parameters as the surface and bottom samples. Note that for Site 4, if there is 
a thermocline, a bottom sample need not be taken.  
 
Collection of Grab Sample s  
TKN, TP , NOx,  and chlorophyll  a samples will be collected from the niskin bottle, which will be gently mixed 
between draws from the bottle to resuspend an y settling particles.  Sonde profiles will be collected first. 
The profile will be examined to determine if a thermo cline is present  which is defined as a change of more 
than 1 degree Centigrade per meter of depth . If no thermocline is present, then grab samples will be 
collected only at the surface and bottom. If a thermocline is present, a sample will be collected just below 
the thermocline. Water samplers will wear gloves and will take care not to touch other surfaces while 
wearing gloves. If gloves are contaminated, they will be removed,  and a new pair utilized. When handling 
sample bottles and tubes, the caps and bottle will be handled in such a way as to prevent gloves from 
touching the inside o f the cap or bottle or the rim of the bottle. Bottles will be filled as quickly as possible 
and capped immediately. TKN and TP samples will be collected in the same bottle. The bottle will contain 
preservative and will not be rinsed with sample. The NOx samples will be collected in acid washed syringe s 
and filtered through 0.45 -micron  cartridge filters into acid washed 50 ml centrifuge tubes. For NOx, the 
syringes will be rinsed with the sample water 3  times before collect ing the sample. 5 ml of sample will 
then be passed through the filter to waste, before collecting 40 ml of sample i n the 50 ml tube. The tube 
will contain preservative and will not be rinsed. Tube s will be capped immediately,  and sample will be 
stored in the cooler on ice. Chlorophyll bottles will not contain a preservative.  Chlorophyll sample   bottles 
will be rinsed three times  with sample water before collecti ng the sample. To rinse chlorophyll bottle s, up 
to 50 ml of sample water will be collecting in the bottle. Bottle will be capped and agitated to mix the 
sample. The rinse water will be dumped  downstream of the sampling site . The rinsing will be repeated 
two more times, after which the bottle will be filled, capped,  and stored in a dark cooler on ice.  
 
Labelling of Grab Samples /Recording of Field Data  
The project name, s tation , date and  time of sampling, the depth of sampling, weather , sea conditions,  
names of staff collecting samples.  volume of samples collected,  and a ny unusual circumstances will be 
recorded in the field notebook.  Field records will be recorded on water -proof paper. Da ta from field sheets 
will be scanned and manually digitized in the laboratory. Bottles will be labelled with project, date, station, 
time of sampling, depth, sampler’s initials,  and parameter.  
 
Replicate Samples  
 For each parameter, one duplicate  sample will be taken for every ten samples collected. If there is not 
enough water in one Niskin cast to collect duplicates for all parameters at one station, the duplicates may 
be split amongst 2 stations. For instance, TKN, TP duplicates collected from station 1 and chlorophyll a 
and NOx duplicates from station 3.  
 
Garb Sample Field Storage  and Transport  (see Appendix E for MWQL Sample Handling SOP)  
Immediately after collection i n the field, s ample  bottles will be placed in Ziploc bags  and stored in coolers  
on ice , in the dark . Samples  will remain in the coolers until arrival at the MWQ L. Loose ice will surround 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
9 
 the samples in the cooler. Temperature of the coolers will be monitored by either measur ing the 
temperature of a water sample that has been stored with the environmental samples during transit. 
Samples will be stored between 0 ºC and 6 ºC.  
 
Sample Handling in the MWQL   
Standard operating procedures  (SOPs)  will be followed for the sampling, preserv ation , transportation, and 
storage  of surface water grab samples (Appendix B, C, D  & E). Special permission has been granted for the 
MWQL to allow an 8 -hour period between collection and filtration for the Kingfish Maine (Chandler Bay) 
chlorophyll samples due to the long travel distance required and the availability of test data showing no 
significant differences in chlorophyll or phaeophytin data obtained from test samples filtered at 6 and 8 
hours after collection (see Appendix H) . Each sample will have a  unique  MWQL  identification which will 
consist of MWQL batch code which includes the date and project,  station code, depth,  and replicate 
number (if more than 1 sample is taken). This unique identification can be t raced to the field data sheet 
and the Chain of Custody form, which will contain additional information.  Samples will be kept within 
temperature parameters specified by the laboratory SOPs and this document, until analysis. 
Temperatures of  refrigerators an d freezers used to store MWQL samples will be monitored on each day 
that the MWQL is in operation,  and the readings will be recorded in a log.

 Quality Objectives  
Sonde data  
All uploaded sonde data spreadsheets will be quality -checked and formatted, at which point the raw data 
files on the handheld computer or sonde will be  deleted from the file directory. Criteria used to validate 
raw profile data from d iscrete sampling will follow Table 6 of MDEP’s marine monitoring program (MDEP 
2017). For raw profile data from discrete sampling, if a data value falls outside of the relevant acceptable 
range, best professional judgment may override these criteria when s upporting data or information 
suggests a real aberration. If no reasonable explanation exists for an aberration, the data value will be 
flagged in the raw data file and not included in subsequent analyses and reporting. 8 
Sonde data will be checked for ext reme values  using conditional formatting in an Excel spreadsheet. See 
Table 5 for ranges. In the event data is outside of these limits, it will be examined further and flagged.

Grab Samples  
Precision : For activities covered under this AWQMP , precision will be measured through an assessment 
of lab oratory sample  duplicates, replicate blank matrix samples and duplicate spiked matrix samples . The 
variability of laboratory blanks and standards will be used t o evaluate the precision of the analytical 
method. The variability of both the blank and spiked matrix sample  will be used to calculate the minimum 
detection limit and the reporting limit of the analytical method . Specific procedures are available in the 
specific protocol SOPs.  
 
Accuracy : To determine the accuracy of the laboratory procedures, certified standard  solutions  
(laboratory control samples (LCS)) will be analyzed with each sample run , with the exception of chlorophyll 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
11 
 a in which a solid standard is analyzed with each run, to  determine the if the readings have drifted from 
the values obtained during the last calib ration with certified standard. The chlorophyll fluorometer is 
calibrated with liquid certified standard two times per year . For all parameters except chlorophyll  a, a 
certified standard will also be used to spike environmental samples  to assess the recove ry of the certified 
standard.  
 
Representativeness:  Sampling stations are chosen based on the current knowledge of the movement of 
water in the vicinity of the proposed outflow. MEDEP will select stations based on the monitoring goals 
and objectives. The sa mpling will take place in a 4-hour window around the second half of alternating ebb 
and flood tides with 1 hour of slack tide in the sampling window.  This will allow for sampling at both high 
and low tide to document any variability with the tide cycle. Sampling will take place in May through 
October which will capture seasonal variability.  The assessment of duplicate grab samples for each 
sampling ev ent (1 duplicate for each 10 samples collected)  will provide and assessment of sampling 
variability.  
 
Comparability: Comparability will be addressed  by making and recording observations and collecting 
samples using methodology approved by the MDEP, by usi ng field staff trained and experienced in the 
sampling methods, and by using methods  approved by the MDEP performed by a laboratory accredited 
by the State of Maine for those methods . Additionally, comparability with  historical MDEP datasets will 
be mainta ined as much as possible by maintaining regular communication  with the MDEP Marine Unit. 
MDEP Marine Unit staff will be welcome to participate in any or all sampling events throughout the year . 
 
Reporting QC Data  
 Quality control data included in the labor atory reports will include, at a minimum, equipment blanks, 
field duplicate s, laboratory control samples, and matrix spikes for nutrient analyses. Laboratory reports 
will also contain a case narrative or equivalent notation, list of qualifiers and definitions, copies of COC 
form that includes  a cooler receipt and preservation check form indica ting  sample temperature.  The 
samples will be in the possession of University of Maine staff from the time of collection to arrival in the 
laboratory. When quality control objectives are not met and best professional judgement determines 
possible field op erator or analytical laboratory error, the responsible party will be contacted,  and 
resolution sought. For field readings, data may be flagged as estimated (“J” ) or rejected (“R”) if no 
correction is possible. For laboratory concerns, the laboratory analys t will be asked to address specific 
questions, and samples will be rerun if sufficient sample remains and holding times can still be met  
 
Special Training/Certification  
Field sampling staff using sonde equipment will be trained and monitored by Damian C. B rady, PhD,  or 
qualified staff member under his supervision and in accordance  with University of Maine requirements .    
All data analysis and reporting will be subject to the review and approval of Damian C. Brady, PhD, 
University of Maine.  The surface water grab samples will be analyzed at the University of Maine Marine 
Water Quality Laboratory (MWQL), a Maine State certified laboratory.  All staff will be trained in relevant 
SOPs and protocols, all required UM safety training as well as data int egrity training.  
 
Documents and Records  
Changes to AWQMP  
Proposed changes this AWQMP  may result from field conditions , equipment failure or other extenuating 
circumstances . If a sampling date must be changed, every attempt will be made to reschedule as so on as 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
12 
 possible and to ensure that the new date complies with the above stated conditions. Changes in field 
procedures may be agreed upon  as MDEP staff participate in field sampling events, in which case such 
changes will be documented in a  revision to this  AWQMP . Other recommended or necessary changes will 
be proposed as a revision to this  sampling plan  and subject to MDEP review and approval. Revised 
Sampling Plans  will be identified by a  unique version number.   
 
Standard Operating Procedures  
Standard Operating Procedures will be a part of Kingfish  Maine’s  and UM’s  quality assurance program. 
For vertical sonde profiling, instruments must be calibrated according to manufacturer’s instructions prior 
to each sampling event  and the SOP (Appendix  A ) must be followed.  The MWQL will follow specific SOP  
procedures included in Appendix B-G. 
 
Data Management  
 
Record Keeping  
Records  will include equipment calibration information  and logs , field data sheets, chain -of custody forms, 
internal laboratory documents, forms and notebooks,  lab reports , field notes, sonde field data and field 
notes . All information, including lab -generated data, will be kept in digital files maintained by the 
University of Maine MWQL. Lab -generated grab sample data w ill be submitted in EDD format  to MEDEP . 
Files may not be deleted or removed from hand -held devices until an electronic or hard copy of the data 
has been saved appropriately and subjected to data QA/QC screening. Anomalous or inconsistent field or 
lab resu lts will not be deleted but will, instead, be flagged in data sets.  
All data will be backed up to secure cloud storage. The MWQL uses role -base data access control principles 
which limit access to data and documents to those specifically authorized  as outlined it the MWQL Quality 
Assurance Manual.   
 
All data resulting from this monitoring program will be managed by the University of Maine. The University 
of Maine field measurements and the lab results will be maintained  at the Darling Mar ine Center.  
All monitoring information will be recorded onto field datasheets that  will be developed prior to field 
sampling. All hard copies of lab field notebook will be electronically duplicated and preserved. Sonde data 
are logged to internal memory on  either the handheld computer or sonde, and then raw files  are uploaded 
to spreadsheets upon return to the office and prior to a subsequent sampling event  
 
Reporting  
Kingfish  Maine  will provide the MDEP with an annual report of the monitoring results on  
or before December 3 1st  of each year. In addition to data tables, graphs, and figures, the report will  
compare results with previous sampling data and note any anomalous or unusual r esults. As appropriate,  
the annual report will identify necessary changes to field sampling methods, this AWQMP , or other 
elements  of the monitoring program  and, potentially, exclusion from reporting results. Flagged data, if 
any, will be described in annu al reports submitted to MDEP.

Definitions:  
 
The definitions and purposes below are specific to this method but  have been conformed 
to common usage as much as possible.  
 
CALIBRATION -- A set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the 
relationship between values of quantities indica ted by a measuring instrument or 
measuring system, or values represented by a material measure or a reference material, 
and the corresponding values realized by standards. In calibration of support equipment, 
the values realized by standards are establishe d through the use of reference standards 
that are traceable to the International System of Units (SI).  
In calibration according to methods, the values realized by standards are typically 
established through the use of reference materials that are either pu rchased by the 
laboratory with a certificate of analysis or purity or  prepared by the laboratory using 
support equipment that has been calibrated or verified to meet specifications.  
 
CALIBRATION STANDARD (CAL) -- A solution prepared from the primary diluti on 
standard solution or stock standard solutions. The CAL solutions are used to calibrate the 
instrument response with respect to analyte concentration.  
 
MilliQ WATER - Reagent water that has been treated to remove impurities through 
reverse osmosis and fi ltration and has a resistivity above 18.0   
Quality control measures:  
All laboratory personnel using this SOP will also comply with all general laboratory QA and QC 
measures as stated elsewhere in th e MWQL  QAM. QA and QC procedures specific to this 
protocol  are documented in this SOP.   
 
The sonde will be calibrated according to manufacturer’s specifications for each parameter the 
business day prior to being used to collect data. If any calibration is not successful, another 
calibration will be performed in order to ensure sensor is working correctly. Sensors have a limited 
lifetime of 1 -3 years depending on type, sensor age will be monitored and replaced when life span 
is exhausted.  If sondes area deployed, they will be calibrated prior to and a fter deployment.  
Summary of Method:  
Application:  
This method is used to obtain in situ water quality measurements for depth, 
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll a, and turbidity.  The sonde 
will be powered by internal batteries and controlled using a battery powered 
handheld  device.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022

Summary of Method:  
A multiparameter sonde is used to collect in situ water quality parameters at discreet depths 
throughout the water column. Typical p arameters include temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, 
pH, chlorophyll a, and turbidity.   
Interferences:  
• The turbidity at the bottom depth can be artificially increased by the instrument 
hitting the bottom. To avoid this, a window weight is attached to the sonde such 
that when the window weight touches the bottom and lays on its side, the sonde is 
0.5m above the bottom. When lowered gently this greatly reduces the incident that 
the bottom sediment is stirred up, artificially increasing turbid ity.  
Safety:  
 
Hazards: This  protocol does not require the use of any hazardous materials. All calibration 
solutions are non -hazardous waste.   There are no known hazards associated with this 
protocol.   
 
Equipment and Supplies:  
• YSI EXO 2 multiparameter sond e with temperature and conductivity, dissolved oxygen, 
pH, total algae, and turbidity sensors installed.   
• Calibration solutions   
o Specific conductivity solution (50,000µS/cm for salt water, 1,000µS/cm for fresh 
water)  
o pH 4, 7, and 10 buffers (for both salt and fresh water)  
o Turbidity standard (12.4FNU or 124FNU depending on expected range in situ)  
o Rhodamine WT  
o MilliQ water   
o Tap water   
• Supplies  
o Aquarium stone and pump  
o YSI EXO2 calibration cup  
o Computer with KOR software   
o 1-liter volumetric flasks  
o Magnet wa nd to turn on sondes   
o 10 ml pipettor with tip  
o 0.5 - 1-liter beakers or jars  
o Dedicated 50 ml and 1 -liter flask for rhodamine calibration

 In situ water quality parameter measurements:   
1. The multiparameter sonde is turned on 10 minutes prior to taking measurements to allow 
instrument to warm up and stabilize readings.  The sonde will activate automatically when 
it is plugged into the handheld and the handheld is turned on.  
2. Once on site at anchor, the sonde is lowered into the water and deployed to 0.5 m eters 
above the bottom or just below the surface where it is held until all reading are stabilized. 
Although casts may be taken from the bottom up or the top down, for the purposes of this 
sampling plan, measurements will be taken from surface to bottom.  
1. If the overall water depth is greater than 5 meters, a measurement is recorded at 
0.5 meters depth , then at 1 meter depth, then every meter until a depth of 10 
meters. At depths greater than 10 meters, a measurement is taken every 2 meters 
finishin g at  0.5 m below the surface.  
2.  If the water column is less than 5m deep, a measurement is recorded at 0.5 
meters, then every half meter, finishing with 0.5m above the surface . Actual depths 
may vary according to project goals.  
3. At each depth interval, the sonde is held at the specific depth until all sensor readings 
have stabilized, then the measurements are recorded to the electronic handheld 
compute r.  
4. Each profile is given a unique name including the station # and date. Files are stored on 
internal memory of the handheld until return to the laboratory.  
5. Field data is also recorded in a waterproof  notebook.  
 
Reagents and Standards:  
All calibration so lutions are purchased from the manufacturer and are used as is. No solutions 
are created in the lab.   
Calibration:   
The instrument is calibrated one business day before collecting measurement.   
 
Calibration Procedure:  
 
• A 5l bucket is filled with 4l of tap water and an aquarium pump and stone is used to bubble 
air through the water to supersaturate it for at least 1 hour prior to calibration.   
• The sonde is turned on and connected to the KOR software. If the sonde is connected 
directly to the laboratory compu ter, it will activate and the magnetic wand is not needed. 
If the sonde is connected to the computer via Bluetooth, then u sers activate Bluetooth 
wireless by holding a magnet at the magnetic activation area on the sonde.   When 
the blue LED on the sonde is off, the Bluetooth is disabled. When the light is on 
continuously, the Bluetooth is enabled, but no link has been established. When the 
blue LED blinks at 2 Hz, the sonde’s Bluetooth is on, and has established a link."   
• The sonde is placed with guard on into the bucket of bubbling water. The barometric 
pressure is noted (from the handheld computer) and used to calibrate the percent 
saturation of the water at the current atmospheric pressure. Once the readings are stable, 
the calibration is accepted.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
17 
 • The c onductivity sensor is calibrated using specific conductance. The sensor is rinsed with 
the old conductivity solution of the appropriate strength (50,000µS/cm for salt water, and 
1,000µS/cm for fresh water)  by submerging the sen sors in a jar of the standard . The sonde 
is then submerged in a jar of new calibration solution of the correct strength. Once 
readings are stable, the calibration is accepted.    
• For pH calibration, the sonde is first placed in the calibration cup with a pH 4 rinse (old 
standard soluti on) and submerged 3 times to avoid cross contamination between 
standards. The sonde is then placed in the freshly opened calibration solution and allowed 
to stabilize. The calibration is accepted once stable, then the user can proceed to pH 7 
and 10 using the same process  following the directions on the handheld.  
• The turbidity is calibrated using a two -step process. First the turbidity sensor is calibrated 
in milliQ water for a zero reference. If a copper guard is being used during sampling  (only 
used for  long-term  deployments) , then the reference is 0.5. The sonde is placed in milliQ 
water,  and the readings are allowed to stabilize before calibration point is accepted. 
Depending on the expected turbidity range of the sampling location, and the upper limit of 
either 12.4 FNU or 124 FNU will be used. The sensors are submerged in a rinse of old 
solution of the same strength, then submerged in fresh calibration solution until readings 
are stable.   
• The total algae sensor is calibrated using a 1 -point calibration  with Mi lliQ or distilled water 
as a zero reference. The sensor is calibrated using relative fluorescence units (RFUs). 
The sensors are rinsed then submerged in fresh MilliQ/distilled water and readings are 
allowed to stabilize before accepting the calibra tion. In the instance where very high 
chlorophyll a concentration is expected (>30µg/L), a two -point calibration can be used with 
a Rhodamine WT solution with a value of 66µg/L for the upper limit.  The sensor should be 
calibrated with rhodamine WT at least two times per year.  
o Two step -Calibration (follow instructions in software)  
 
▪ Zero 
▪ Use MilliQ for zero blank  
▪ Second Point  
▪ Use 125 mg/l Rhodamine WT in a dark bottle located in the 
chemical fridge in BGC as primary stock.  
▪ To make working solution stock : pipet 5 ml of the primary stock of 
rhodamine WT into a 1 L flask  
▪ Note: there is a dedicated labeled volumetric flask for 
Rhodamine kept on the shelf to the upper left before 
entering the microscope room. Do not use any other flasks 
for Rhodamine.  
▪ Put st ock, pipette and flask in glass tray to catch any spills 
or drips.  
▪ Leave flask in the in the dark while running the zero blank 
to allow it to come to room temperature (microscope 
room/cabinet until you use it)  
▪ Fill the flask to 1 L with MiliQ water  
▪ Cap the  flask and invert a couple of time to mix, the working 
solution can be kept for 24 hours  
▪ Pour the dilute Rhodamine directly in to the Sonde cup and rinse 
the sensor  
▪ Dispose of the rinse liquid and refill for calibration  
▪ Calibrate, use “RFU” instead of “Chlorophyll in ug/L ” 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
18 
 ▪ Refer to the total algae calibration table in the manual (p. 
136) to get the temperature dependent value to input into 
the calibration  
▪ When finished dispose of the Rhodamine working solution into the waste 
container in the  lab. 
Pollution Prevention and waste management:  
 
Although none of the solutions used in this procedure are hazardous, they are still treated as 
waste according to the following procedures. All wastes will be handled in accordance with 
University of Maine Safety and Environmental Management Guidelines. Waste will be stored in 
properly labeled containers with secondary containment. Waste will be located in approved areas 
and will be inspected weekly. When waste containers are full, they will be transported b y the 
Darling Marine Center Safety Officer to a secure dedicated waste storage facility on the DMC 
campus. At the point of pick up and transport to the DMC waste storage facility, the responsibility 
for monitoring of the waste is transferred to the DMC saf ety officer.   Waste will be stored until 
pickup by a University of Maine approved waste disposal company.

DEFINITIONS  
The definitions and purposes below are specific to this method but  have been conformed to 
common usage as much as possible.  
 
ANALYST - The designated individual who performs the “hands -on” analytical methods and 
associated techniques and who is the one responsible for applying required laboratory practices 
and other pert inent quality controls to meet the required level of quality.  
ANALYTICAL BATCH -- An analytical batch is a group of environmental samples that are prepared 
and/or analyzed together with the same process and personnel, using the same lot(s) of reagents. 
A batch is composed of at least one and no more than 20 environmental sample(s) of the same 
quality systems matrix, meeting the above -mentioned criteria and with a maximum time 
between the start of processing of the first and last sample in the batch to be 24  hours. An 
analytical batch is composed of prepared environmental samples (extracts, digestates or 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
20 
 concentrates) which are analyzed together as a group. An analytical batch can include prepared 
samples originating from various quality system matrices and c an exceed 20 samples.  
CALIBRATION -- A set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship 
between values of quantities indicated by a measuring instrument or measuring system, or values 
represented by a material measure or a ref erence material, and the corresponding values 
realized by standards. In calibration of support equipment, the values realized by standards are 
established through the use of reference standards that are traceable to the International System 
of Units (SI).  
In calibration according to methods, the values realized by standards are typically established 
through the use of reference materials that are either purchased by the laboratory with a 
certificate of analysis or purity or  prepared by the laboratory using support equipment that has 
been calibrated or verified to meet specifications.  
CALIBRATION BLANK (CB) -- A volume of reagent water in the same matrix as the calibration 
standards, but without the analyte.  
CALIBRATION STANDARD (CAL) -- A solution prepared f rom the primary dilution standard solution 
or stock standard solutions. The CAL solutions are used to calibrate the instrument response with 
respect to analyte concentration.  
CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL -- (CRM) means reference material, accompanied by a 
certificate, having a value, measurement of uncertainty and stated metrological traceability chain 
to a national metrology institute  
CHAIN OF CUSTODY FORM (COC) -- A record, either paper -based or electronic, that documents 
the possession of the samples from the time of collection to receipt in the laboratory in 
accordance with chain -of-custody protocol. This record, at a minimum, must include the sample 
location, the number and types of containers, the mode of collection, the collector, the date and 
time of collection, preservation, and requested analyses. See also Legal Chain of Custody 
Protocols.  
FIELD BLANK (FB) -- An aliquot of reagent water or equivalent neutral r eference material treated 
as a sample in all aspects, including exposure to a sample bottle holding time, preservatives, and 
all pre -analysis treatments. The purpose is to determine if the field or sample transporting 
procedures and environments have conta minated the sample.  
FIELD DUPLICATE (FD) -- Two samples taken at the same time and place under identical 
circumstances which are treated identically throughout field and laboratory procedures. Analysis 
of field duplicates indicates the precision associated  with sample collection, preservation, and 
storage, as well as with laboratory procedures.  
LABORATORY BLANK (LB) -- An aliquot of reagent water or equivalent neutral reference material 
treated as a sample in all aspects, except that it is not taken to the sampling site. The purpose is 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
21 
 to determine if the if analytes or interferences are present in the laboratory environment, the 
reagents, or the apparatus.  
LABORATORY CONTROL STANDARD (LCS) -- A solution prepared in the  
laboratory by dissolving a known amoun t of one or more pure compounds in a known amount of 
reagent water. Its purpose is to assure that the results produced by the laboratory remain within 
the acceptable limits for precision and accuracy. (This should not be confused with a calibration 
standar d). 
LABORATORY DUPLICATE (LD) -- Two aliquots of the same environmental sample treated 
identically throughout a laboratory analytical procedure. Analysis of laboratory duplicates 
indicates precision associated with laboratory procedures but not with sample  collection, 
preservation, or storage procedures.

analyte spike of known concentration at least 4 times the MDL. Used to evaluate the effect of 
the sample matrix on the analy tical results.  
LIMIT OF QUANTITATION ( LOQ) -- The minimum levels, concentrations,  or quantities of a target 
variable (e.g., target analyte) that can be reported with a specified degree of confidence.  
METHOD DETECTION LIMIT (MDL) -- The lowest level at whic h an analyte can be detected with 
99 percent confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero.  
MilliQ WATER - Reagent water that has been treated to remove impurities through reverse 
osmosis and filtration and has a resistivity above 18.0.   
QUALITY CONTROL CHECK SAMPLE (QCCS) -- A sample containing analytes of interest at known 
concentrations (true values) of analytes. The QCS is obtained for a source external to the 
laboratory or is prepared from standards obtained from a different source tha n the calibration 
standards. The purpose is to check laboratory performance using test materials that have been 
prepared independently from the normal preparation process.  
Quality control measures:  
 
All laboratory personnel using this SOP will also comply with all general laboratory QA and QC measures 
as stated elsewhere in this QAM. QA and QC procedures specific to this protocol are documented in this 
SOP.  
Initial Demonstration of performance:  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
22 
 ● Method Detection Limit (MDL) - The minimum detection limit will be determined by 
analyzing blank variability and by spiking a blank with analyte at a concentration 
from 2 to  10 times the estimated MDL. Seven blanks and seven MDL spikes will 
be carried through all aspects of preparation an d analysis in a minimum of three 
separate sample batches on three separate calendar dates. The reported MDL will 
be the larger of the MDL calculated from the blanks and the MDL calculated from 
the spiked matrix samples.  
○ To determine the MDL of the spiked m atrix samples:  
■ Calculate the standard deviation of the 7 spikes.  
■ Multiply the standard deviation of the spiked matrix by 3.143 (for 
seven replicates).  
○ To determine the MDL of the blanks:  
■ Calculate the mean of the method blanks.  
■ If the mean is negative equ ate it to zero.  
■ Multiply the standard deviation of the blanks by 3.143 (for seven 
replicates) and add the result to the mean.  
● Limit of Quantitation - Obtain the limit of quantitation by calculating the mean 
and standard deviation of replicate standards be tween 2 - 10 times the estimated 
or known LOD. Multiply the standard deviation by the t value obtained from the t 
test table for the replicate degrees of freedom and the desired cumulative 
probability based on a two tailed test. For instance, the  99% cumul ative 
probability.  
● Quality Control Check Sample (QCCS) - Semi -annually, a QCCS will be ordered from an EPA 
recommended provider lab. The sample will be analyzed,  and results sent to the provider 
lab. If results are not within the acceptable limits of  state d values, the source of the 
problem will be identified and corrected.  
 
● Demonstration of Linearity - A standard curve over the working range (0.05 - 0.40 mg/l)  
of the method will be run once per year to demonstrate linearity.  
 
Ongoing quality control meas ures:  
 
● Duplicate Laboratory Blanks - Duplicate lab reagent blanks will be analyzed with each 
batch of samples.  
●  Laboratory Control Standard - Duplicate LCSs are analyzed with each batch of samples, 
no less than one for every ten samples to determine the ac curacy of the analytical 
protocol. If the measured analyte concentration varies by more than 10% from the 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
23 
 certified concentration, the analysis will stop,  and the source of error will be determined 
before sample analysis resumes.  
● Calibration Standards - A set of CAL standards, covering 4 concentrations that span the 
expected sample concentrations, will be analyzed with each batch of samples.  
● A CAL standard at or below the RL will be analyzed at minimum once per month. The 
concentration obtained should be w ithin 40% of the true concentration.  
● Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix - 10% of the analyzed samples will be spiked with 
analyte to give a concentration at least four times the MDL prior to digestion. The percent 
recovery will be determined from these sam ples. If the percent recovery falls outside to 
the 80% -120% range, analysis will stop,  and the source of the error will be determined 
and resolved before continuing analysis.  
● Laboratory Duplicates - A set of  LDs will be analyzed in each batch of samples. Duplicates 
should not vary more than 10%.  
 
 
 
Summary of Method:  
Application:  
 
This method is used to obtain the total concentration of nitrate plus nitrite (NOx), from 
filtered freshwater and seawater  samples.  The method is appropriate for samples with 
total concentration up to 0.4 mg/l NOx - N or 400 μg/l NOx - N. Samples with higher 
concentrations of NOx -N may be diluted and the diluted sample analyzed using this 
protocol.  
 
Summary of Method:  
 
A filtered sample is mixed with a pH 8.5 buffer. The mixture of sample and buffer passes through a column 
containing reduced granulated copper -cadmium which provides hydrogen for the reduction of nitrate to 
nitrite. The nitrite (consisting of nitrite that was  originally present plus reduced nitrate) is determined by 
diazotizing nitrite with sulfanilamide and coupling with N -(1-napthyl) -ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to 
form a highly colored azo dye which is absorbs light at  a wavelength of 540 nm. The dye is detected 
spectrophotometrically and is proportional to the total nitrite concentration in the sample. Though the 
method is designed for seawater and brackish water, it is also applicable to freshwater sample matrices. 
The method is calibrated using standar ds prepared in deionized water. Once calibrated, samples of varying

 salinities (0 to 35 ppt) may be analyzed. The determination of background is necessary only for samples 
which have color absorbing at 540 nm  
Interferences:  
● Particulate matter can clog the cadmium reduction column restricting flow and reducing 
sensitivity. To avoid this issue, samples are filtered before analysis.  
● Samples containing high levels of metals such as copper and iron, may have reduced response. 
Increasing the EDTA concentration in  the buffer can mitigate this problem.  
● Significant amounts of oil and grease in samples, interfere with the reduction process and can 
damage the cadmium reduction column. Samples with visible oil and grease will not be analyzed.  
● Samples that absorb signifi cantly at 540 nm, can be analyzed with and without the color reagent 
to determine the background absorbance.  
○ In our experience samples with significant absorbance at 540 nm are rare in 
environmental water samples.  
○ If samples are colored this interference can be determined and subtracted.  
■ First, calibrate in the standard fashion.  
■  Next, replace the color reagent with a solution containing 100 ml/L H 3PO 4. 
■  Finally, reanalyze the samples.  
■ The color interference signal can then be subtracted from the sample signal.  
● All plastic and glassware must be thoroughly cleaned to avoid contamination.

the dark on ice until preservation in the laboratory.  
● Samples must be pre served within 8 hours of collection.  
● Samples are preserved by adding sufficient 0.5 M sulfuric acid to lower the pH to < 2.0 within 8 
hours of collection or by adding sufficient acid to the collection tube prior to filing  with the filtered 
sample.  
● Preserved samples are stored at < 6 degrees C  in a refrigerator for up to 28 days.  
● Before analysis, the pH of the samples must be raised to between 5 and 9 with the addition of 
50% sodium hydroxide. See detailed method below.

a. Make a 1:10 dilution of the 1000 mg -N/l Hach standard in a volumetric flask (5 ml of Hach 
#1279249 in a total of 50 ml). Other concentration may be used but must be between 2 - 
10 times the MDL.  
b.  If the measured concentrations are not between 90% and 110% of the certified 
concentration, the results will be considered unacceptable,  and the source of error will 
then be determined and fixed before samples are analyzed . 
 
Calibration and standardization:  
● The instrument is calibrated before analyzing samples.  
○ Analyze at least two samples of milliQ water to flush and equilibrate the  system before 
analyzing standards.  
○ Analyze The working (CAL) standard series.  
○ Analyze two laboratory blanks.  
○ Analyze the LCS after the CAL standards to confirm the accuracy of the CAL standards.  
○ Then analyze at least two of the CAL standards a second time to ensure that the readings 
are stable.  
○ If the LCS is within 10% of certified  concentration and the second set of CAL standards is 
within 10% of the first set, then samples may be run.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
31 
 ○ If LCS is not within 10% of certified value:  
■ Compare CAL standard peak areas between the first and second set.  
● If CAL standard sets vary by more tha n 10%, find source of error and 
mitigate.  
● If CAL standards vary by less than 10%, rerun LCS.  
○ If LCS variability remains at more than 10%, remake LCS and 
rerun.  
○ Analyze a set of LB and LCS standards for every ten samples in a batch of samples. If the 
LCS s amples vary more than 10% from the mean values, then a new set of CAL standards 
should be analyzed.  
○ The lowest CAL standard should be measured to within 40% of the true value.  
■ If the lowest concentration CAL standard is not within 40% of the true value, st op 
the run and start the troubleshooting process.  
○ If the cadmium column has been used to reduce more than 100 samples or if the 
instrument response is less than expected for a given concentration of analyte, then a 250 
microgram/l sodium nitrite standard s hould be analyzed to verify the efficiency of the 
cadmium column. More detail can be found in the “Quality  Control” section of this SOP.  
 
NOx Colorimetric Analytical Procedure:  
The NOx manifold is installed on Channel 4 on the MWQL QuikChem.  
 
● If samples have been preserved with sulfuric acid, add NaOH to bring them to a pH of between 5 -
9. This process is time consuming. Be sure to allow adequate time to adjust pH before the sample 
analysis run.  
○ Calibrate pH meter with pH 4, pH 7, and 10 buffers ac cording to meter directions.  
○ Using an acid cleaned 10 ml pipet tip, take a 10 -20 ml subsample of the preserved sample,  
and put into a clean small beaker  
○ Add a small stir bar to the beaker  
○ Put the beaker on the stir plate.  
○ Turn on the stir plate.  
○ Thorough ly rinse pH probe.  
○ Put the pH probe in the clamp of a ring stand and adjust height so that the pipet tip is 
below the surface of the sample.  
○ Measure and record the pH, being careful that the spinning stir bar doesn’t hit the pH 
probe.  
○ Add a small amount o f 0.5 - 2N sodium hydroxide to the subsample, measure the pH.  
○ Continue until the pH of the subsample is between 5 and 9.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
32 
 ○ Record the normality of the NaOH and the total volume of NaOH required to bring the 
sample to the proper pH.  
○ Calculate the proper amount  of NaOH to add to the remaining sample.  
■ VNaOH(ml)=Volume in ml of NaOH needed to bring a X ml volume of sample to 
pH between 5 and 9.  
■ VS(ml) = volume of sample remaining after 10 -20  ml removed for test.  
■ Volume NaOH to add to remaining sample = (VNaOH(ml) *VS(ml))/volum of test 
sample.  
○ Add the calculated amount of NaOH to the remaining sample.  
● Check that the instrument NOx manifold detector filter is in place and the cell is properly seated.  
○  If the filter is not in the slot, it will be found in the second Lachat instrument.  
● Verify that the sample line is connected to the sample valve of the NOx channel.  
● Verify that the reduction column valve is in the “off” position.  
● Turn on power to autoanalyzer, autosampler, and pump.  
● Turn on the computer.  
● Open the Lachat  software  
● Open the NOx method or a run file from a previous NOx run.

● Put all reagent lines in a bottle of milliQ water.  
● Put the channel effluent lines into the water collection bottle.  
● Load the tubing into pump channels.  
● Making sure that tabs on the pump cartridges are all the way to the left, push down on each 
cartridge to secure it to the pump. Each side of the cartridge will make a “click” as it locks in.  
● Tighten pressure controls on pump cartridges by pushing tab all the way to the right and then 
back to the left until it clicks in place.  
● Set the pump speed t o 35.  
● Start the pump.  
● Check for leaks and other problems.  
● Verify that water is flowing through all reagent tubing.  
● Reduce pump speed to less than 5.  
● Pump milliQ water through lines until baseline is stable, at least a half hour.  
● Remove manifold waste line s from the water collection bottle and put them into the chemical 
waste carboy.  
○ Make sure that the end of the waste tubing is above the waste level.  
○ Cover opening with parafilm.  
○ Set cap on top of carboy to prevent loss.  
● Cut parafilm to cover all reagent bottles.  
● Remove intakes from water and put them in corresponding reagent bottles, covering each with 
parafilm as you proceed. Note to switch lines to water following the diagram  in Appendix A 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022

 starting at the bottom of the diagram and moving upward. When removing  lines from reagent, 
start at the top of the diagram and go downward.  
● Set up a run containing the following.  
○ At least two samples of milliQ water which will be used to give the system a final rinse 
before analysis.  
○ The CAL standards.  
○ A LCS and a LB immediately following the CAL standards.  
○ A second set of at least two of the CAL standards to verify instrument stability.  
○ Put rinse tubes, blanks,  and standards in the autosampler rack.  
● Let reagents run through manifolds for at least 10 minutes.  
● After 10 minutes turn the cadmium reduction column to the “on” position.  
● Use the “preview” function of the software to monitor the baseline.  
● When the baseline appears flat and stable, start the standard run.  
● Graph the response for CAL standards to check li nearity of instrument response.  
● If the r squared value is not above 0.98, the instrument may not have stabilized; rerun the 
standards.  
● Use these curves to test instrument function and set the integration parameters for the analysis.  
● Calculate the concentr ation of the LCS from the linear regression of the CAL standards.  
● If the LCS recovery deviates more than 10% from certified value, resolve before proceeding 
sample run.  
● Once standard curve, blanks and certified standards are finished and determined to be within QC 
parameters, samples can be analyzed.  
○ The sample run must contain:  
■ An LCS and a LB for every 10 samples.  
■ One LFSM for every batch of 20 samples.  
■ One replicate sample for every 10 samples.  
● Once analysis is finished, close the valve to the cadmiu m column.

Data Analysis and Calculations:  
The spectrophotometric detector for NOx forms peaks of voltage response which are integrated within 
the software to provide the peak area of the response. The parameters for integration are set for each 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
34 
 run based on the standard and blank analysis. This pe ak area is directly proportional to analyte 
concentration.  
CAL - Standard concentration and peak areas are graphed with a scatter plot in Excel or another  graphing 
program. A linear regression of the data is calculated. The r -squared value of the standard  curve must be 
above .98 for use in this method. If the r -squared value falls below 0.98, then the instrument will be 
checked for malfunction and the standards will be run again. The linear regression is used to calculate the 
concentration of the analytes in the samples.  
Low CAL Standard - The lowest CAL standard should be equal to or lower in concentration than the current 
RL. The measured value should be within 40% of the actual value.  
Accuracy  - The QCCS or LCS concentration is calculated using the line ar regression obtained from the CAL 
standard regression. The accuracy of the CAL standards is calculated as follows:  
(ABS(QCCS/LCS certified concentration - QCCS/LCS measured concentration)/QCCS/LCS certified 
concentration) * 100.  
Precision - The percent e rror for replicate samples or standards (including FD, LD, QCCS, LCS or CAL 
standards) is calculated using the absolute value of the difference between each of the duplicates using  
the following equation:  
 
Variability Rep =(Error/Sample Mean) x 100,  
Error = (ABS(Rep1 -Rep2))/2  
Percent Recovery : 
The percent recovery of the replicate spiked samples (LFSM) is calculated using the following equations:  
% Spike Recovery = Mean(Recovery 1, Recovery 2) 
Recovery 1 = ((Analyte Spike1 - Analyte S1 )/Calculated concentration  of spike) x 100.  
Recovery 1 = ((Analyte Spike2 - Analyte S2 )/Calculated concentration of spike) x 100.  
Analyte S1 = Measured concentration of sample 1.  
Analyte Spike1 = Measured concentration of sample1 spike.  
Analyte S2  = Measured concentration of sample 2.  
Analyte Spike2= Measured concentration of sample 2 spike.  
Minimum Detection Limit:  
The minimum detection limit is calculated from the error of seven blanks or 7 low concentration 
standards, whichever is largest. See quality control section above for more de tails.  
The minimum detection limit is calculated as follows:  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
35 
 1. Calculate the concentrations of the 7 blank replicates and the 7 spikes from the CAL standard 
curve.  
2. Calculate the mean of the 7 blanks. If it is negative, equate it to zero.  
3. Calculate the standard deviation of the 7 blanks.  
4. Multiply the standard deviation of the 7 blanks by 3.143.  
5. Add the mean of the 7 blanks to the result from line 4. 
6. Calculate the standard deviation of the 7 spikes.  
7. Multiply the standard deviation of the 7 spikes by 3.143 . 
8. The minimum detection limit is the greater of line 5 and line 7.

Corrective Actions:  
General precision problems:  
If baseline drifts, peaks are too wide, or peaks are atypical in shape (see Figure 1, for typical peak shap e): 
● Check that there is not an obstruction in the tubing that is causing pressure buildup and retarding 
the flow of the carrier.  
○ The cadmium column is a common source of obstruction.  
■ It is important to not let air get into the cadmium column.  
● When flushing column always keep buffer flowing through the column.  
■ Check the cadmium column switching valve and the column fittings for 
obstructions or crimped tubing.  
○ Check flow of reagents. ‘If reagent is not flowing properly:  
■ Replace pump tubing.  
■ Check all fittings for obstructions or crimping tubing.  
○ Check waste tubing for crimps or obstructions.  
● Check sulfanilamide reagent for precipitate in the bottom of the bottle. If there is a precipitate, 
solution should be filtered into a clean dark bottle using a 0.22-micron  filter.  
● If the above actions do not alleviate the problem, clean the manifold by the following procedure:  
○ Switch off the cadmium column valve.  
○ Place transmission lines in water and pump to clear reagents (2 -5 
minutes).  
● Place reagent lines in 1 M hydrochloric acid (1 volume of HCl added  

 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
38 
 to 11 volumes of water) and pump for several minutes.  
● Place all transmission lines in water and pump for several minutes.  
● Resume pumping reagents.  
Poor instrument response:  
● Remake CAL standards.  
● If sensitivity issues result from excessive bubbles forming in tubing:  
○ Check that reagents are at room temperature. If not, warm reagents in tepid water bath 
and mix.  
○ Degas reagents.  
○ Check intake tubing in bottles for obstructions.  
● If the peak heights are not  within 25% of the heights achieved for the previous analytical 
run for similar concentrations:  
○ The cadmium column is decreasing in sensitivity.  
○ If the CAL standard variability is less than 10% and the LCS accuracy is within the 
10% margin of error, you ma y continue the run.  
■ Analyze a set of at least 3 LB and 3 replicates of a low CAL standard (within 
2-10 times the previous MDL) to ensure that the sensitivity has not 
decreased.  
■ Analyze two concentrations of sodium nitrite that are within the range of 
the CAL standards to characterize the reduction efficiency of the cadmium 
column.  
■ If sensitivity has decreased, report new MDL with batch results.  
■ Replace cadmium column before the next analytical run.  
■ As noted above, the cadmium column can become plugged.  
● If this happens, remove the downstream fitting,  and run reagent through 
into a beaker to flush the column.  
● If the column is still plugged, reverse the column flow and flush a  second 
time.  
● If the calibration fails consistently, replace the column.  
 
Poor precision:  
● If replicate digested standards or sample analytical replicates vary by more than 10% from mean 
values:  
■ Check pump tubing.  
■ Check back pressure tubing for leaks.  
■ Check for bubbles.  
■ Let the instrument equilibrate longer (inadequate equilibration c an cause 
variability).  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
39 
 ■ Check for blockages in lines.  
■ If precision of analytical replicates is still unacceptable, after implementing the 
above remedies, replace the cadmium column.  
■ If cadmium column replacement does not improve signal, remake reagents.  
○ If precision of analytical replicates of CAL standards are within 10% of the mean, but LCS 
values vary more than 10% from certified values:  
■  Remake CAL standards.  
■ Remake LCS diluted standards.  
■ Rerun both CAL and LCS.  
○ If analytical replicates vary by more than  10% but not by more than 20%, continue run, 
recording out of limit QC parameters.  
● If replicates vary by more than 20% stop run.  
● Remedy problems before running samples.  
Pollution Prevention and waste management:  
 
All wastes will be handled in accordance with University of Maine Safety and Environmental Management 
Guidelines. Waste will be stored in properly labeled containers with secondary containment. Waste will 
be located in approved areas and will be inspected weekly. When waste containers are full, they will be 
transported by the Darling Marine Center Safety Officer to a secure dedicated waste storage facility on 
the DMC campus. At the point of pick up and transport to the DMC waste storage facility, the respon sibility 
for monitoring of the waste, is transferred to the DMC safety officer.  Waste will be stored until pickup by 
a University of Maine approved waste disposal company. All MWQL staff who handle waste will be 
required to complete the Hazardous Waste tr aining provided by the University of Maine.  
The MWQL is committed to reducing chemical waste and will maintain the lowest volume of chemical 
stocks that is practical while maintaining adequate stock to guard against shortages and back orders. All 
expired chemicals will be disposed of as chemical waste and transferred to the DMC waste storage facility. 
The lab does not dispose of any chemicals down the drain. The spent cadmium columns are treated as 
hazardous waste and are disposed of as such when no longer  useful.

Applicable concentration ranges:  
 TKN working range: RL - 5.0 mg N/l  
 TP working range: RL - 5.0 mg N/l  
DEFINITIONS  
 
The definitions and purposes below are specific to this method but  have been conformed to 
common usage as much as possible.  
 
ANALYST --  The designated individual who performs the “hands -on” analytical methods and 
associated techniques and who is the one r esponsible for applying required laboratory practices 
and other pertinent quality controls to meet the required level of quality.  
ANALYTICAL BATCH -- An analytical batch is a group of environmental samples that are prepared 
and/or analyzed together with th e same process and personnel, using the same lot(s) of reagents. 
A preparation batch is composed of at least one and no more than 20 environmental sample(s) 
of the same quality systems matrix, meeting the above -mentioned criteria and with a maximum 
time be tween the start of processing of the first and last sample in the batch to be 24 hours. An 
analytical batch is composed of prepared environmental samples (extracts, digestates or 
concentrates) which are analyzed together as a group. An analytical batch can  include prepared 
samples originating from various quality system matrices and can exceed 20 samples, unless the 
method requirements are more stringent.  
BIAS --  The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process, which causes errors in 
one d irection (e.g., the expected sample measurement is different from the sample’s true value).  
CALIBRATION --  A set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship 
between values of quantities indicated by a measuring instrument or  measuring system, or values 
represented by a material measure or a reference material, and the corresponding values 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022

44 
 realized by standards. In calibration of support equipment, the values realized by standards are 
established through the use of reference s tandards that are traceable to the International System 
of Units (SI).  
In calibration according to methods, the values realized by standards are typically established 
through the use of reference materials that are either purchased by the laboratory with a  
certificate of analysis or purity or  prepared by the laboratory using support equipment that has 
been calibrated or verified to meet specifications.  
CALIBRATION BLANK (CB) -- A volume of reagent water in the same matrix as the calibration 
standards, but w ithout the analyte.  
CALIBRATION STANDARD (CAL) -- A solution prepared from the primary dilution standard solution 
or stock standard solutions. The CAL solutions are used to calibrate the instrument response with 
respect to analyte concentration.  
CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL -- (CRM) means reference material, accompanied by a 
certificate, having a value, measurement of uncertainty and stated metrological traceability chain 
to a national metrology institute  
CHAIN OF CUSTODY FORM (COC) --  A record, either pap er-based or electronic, that documents 
the possession of the samples from the time of collection to receipt in the laboratory in 
accordance with chain -of-custody protocol. This record, at a minimum, must include the sample 
location, the number and types of  containers, the mode of collection, the collector, the date and 
time of collection, preservation, and requested analyses. See also Legal Chain of Custody 
Protocols.  
FIELD BLANK (FB) -- An aliquot of reagent water or equivalent neutral reference material t reated 
as a sample in all aspects, including exposure to a sample bottle holding time, preservatives, and 
all pre -analysis treatments. The purpose is to determine if the field or sample transporting 
procedures and environments have contaminated the sample.  
FIELD DUPLICATE (FD) -- Two samples taken at the same time and place under identical 
circumstances which are treated identically throughout field and laboratory procedures. Analysis 
of field duplicates indicates the precision associated with sample collec tion, preservation, and 
storage, as well as with laboratory procedures.  
INSTRUMENT BLANK --  A clean sample processed through the instrumental steps of the 
measurement process and used to determine instrument contamination.  
LABORATORY BLANK (LB) -- An aliq uot of reagent water or equivalent neutral reference material 
treated as a sample in all aspects, except that it is not taken to the sampling site. The purpose is 
to determine if the if analytes or interferences are present in the laboratory environment, t he 
reagents, or the apparatus.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
45 
 LABORATORY CONTROL STANDARD (LCS) -- A solution prepared in the  
laboratory by dissolving a known amount of one or more pure compounds in a known amount of 
reagent water. Its purpose is to assure that the results produced by t he laboratory remain within 
the acceptable limits for precision and accuracy. (This should not be confused with a calibration 
standard).  
LABORATORY DUPLICATE (LD) -- Two aliquots of the same environmental sample treated 
identically throughout a laboratory analytical procedure. Analysis of laboratory duplicates 
indicates precision associated with laboratory procedures but not with sample collection, 
preservation, or storage procedures.  
LABORATORY FORTIFIED SAMPLE MATRIX  (LFSM) -- An environmental sample cont aining an 
analyte spike of known concentration at least 4 times the MDL. Used to evaluate the effect of 
the sample matrix on the analytical results.  
LIMIT OF QUANTITATION  (LOQ) -- The minimum levels, concentrations,  or quantities of a target 
variable (e.g ., target analyte) that can be reported with a specified degree of confidence.  
MINIMUM DETECTION LIMIT (MDL), also known as the Limit of Detection -- The lowest level at 
which an analyte can be detected with 99 percent confidence that the analyte concentra tion is 
greater than zero.  
MilliQ WATER - Reagent water that has been treated to remove impurities through reverse 
osmosis and filtration and has a resistivity above 18.0 .  
QUALITY CONTROL CHECK SAMPLE (QCCS) – Also known as a proficiency sample. A sample 
containing analytes of int erest at known concentrations (true values) of analytes. The QCS is 
obtained for a source external to the laboratory or is prepared from standards obtained from a 
different source than the calibration standards. The purpose is to check laboratory performan ce 
using test materials that have been prepared independently from the normal preparation 
process.  
SENSITIVITY --  The capability of a method or instrument to discriminate between measurement 
responses representing different levels (e.g., concentrations) o f a variable of interest.

 QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES:  
 
All laboratory personnel using this SOP will also comply with all general laboratory QA and QC measures 
as stated elsewhere in this QAM. QA and QC procedures specific to this protocol are documented in this 
SOP.  
 
Initial Demonstration of performance:  
 
● Method Detection Limit (MDL) -  The minimum detection limit will be determined by 
analyzing blank variability and by spiking a blank with analyte at a concentration 
from 2 to  10 times the estimated MDL . Seven blanks and seven MDL spikes will 
be carried through all aspects of preparation and analysis in a minimum of three 
separate sample batches on three separate calendar dates. The reported MDL will 
be the larger of the MDL calculated from the blanks an d the MDL calculated from 
the spiked matrix samples.  
○ To determine the MDL of the spiked matrix samples:  
■ Calculate the standard deviation of the 7 spikes.  
■ Multiply the standard deviation of the spiked matrix by 3.143 (for 
seven replicates).  
○ To determine the  MDL of the blanks:  
■ Calculate the mean of the method blanks.  
■ If the mean is negative equate it to zero.  
■ Multiply the standard deviation of the blanks by 3.143 (for seven 
replicates) and add the result to the mean.  
 
● Limit of Quantitation – Also known as the Reporting Limit (RL). Obtain the limit of 
quantitation by calculating the mean and standard deviation of replicate 
standards between 2 - 10 times the estimated or known MDL. Multiply the 
standard deviation by the t value obtained from the t test table for the replicate 
degrees of freedom and the desired cumulative probability based on a two tailed 
test. For instance, the 99% cumulative probability.  
 
● Quality Control Check Sample -  Semi -annually, a QCCS will be ordered from an EPA 
recommended provider la b. The sample will be analyzed,  and results sent to the provider 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
47 
 lab. If results are not within the acceptable limits  of stated values, the source of the 
problem will be identified and corrected.  
 
● Demonstration of Linearity - A standard curve over the wo rking range of the method will 
be run at least once per year to demonstrate linearity.  
 
 
Ongoing quality control measures:  
 
● Duplicate Lab Reagent Blanks  - Duplicate lab reagent blanks will be analyzed with each 
batch of samples.  
 
● Laboratory Control Stan dard - Duplicate LCSs from a second source, different from the 
CAL standards, are analyzed with each batch of samples, no less than one for every ten 
samples to determine the accuracy of the analytical protocol. If the measured analyte 
concentration varies  by more than 10% from the certified concentration, the analysis will 
stop,  and the source of error will be determined before sample analysis resumes.  
 
● Calibration Standards - A set of CAL, covering a minimum of 4 concentrations that span 
the expected samp le concentrations, will be analyzed with each batch of samples  
 
● Laboratory Fortified Sample Matrix - 10% of the analyzed samples will be spiked with 
analyte to give a concentration at least four times the MDL prior to digestion. The percent 
recovery will b e determined from these samples. If the percent recovery falls outside to 
the 80% -120% range, analysis will stop,  and the source of the error will be determined 
and resolved before continuing analysis.  
 
● Laboratory Duplicates -  A set of  LDs will be analy zed in each batch of samples. Duplicates 
should not vary more than 10%.  
 
● Minimum Detection Limit must be recalculated every 6  months.

 SUMMARY OF METHOD  
 
Suitability of method and application:  
 
This method is used to obtain TKN, which is composed of the ammonium in the sample 
plus organic nitrogen and to obtain the TP of the sample, from unfiltered liquid samples.  
The method is appropriate for fresh and seawater samples with a TP or TKN concentr ation 
up to 5 mg/l. Samples with higher concentrations of TP or TKN may be diluted,  and the 
diluted sample analyzed using this protocol. The method consists of a digestion and 
subsequent analytical steps.  
 
Digestion:  
 
Using copper sulfate as a catalyst, liquid samples are heated in glass digestion tubes in 
the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. Potassium sulfate is also incorporated to raise 
the boiling temperature of the digestion and therefore, to lessen the time required. 
Hangar crystals  are added to each digestion tube to prevent splattering and boiling over 
of samples. During the digestion, the samples' phosphorus is converted to the 
orthophosphate (PO 43-) anion. Organic nitrogen compounds are converted to ammonium 
sulfate (NH 4)2SO4, under the conditions of the digestion described. After the digestion 
period, the digestion tubes are removed from the digester and the residue is cooled. The 
digest is then diluted to its original volume with DI water and the sample is mixed to 
dissolve any precipitate.  
 
TKN colorimetric analysis:  
The TKN is analyzed using a Lachat Quickchem 8500 autoanalyzer. The digested sample is 
injected onto the chemistry manifold where its pH is raised to a known, basic pH, by in -
line neutralization and maintained with  a  concentrated buffer. This inline neutralization 
converts the ammonium cation to ammonia, and also prevents undue influence of the 
sulfuric acid matrix on the pH -sensitive color reaction which follows. The ammonia thus 
produced is heated with salicylate  and hypochlorite to produce blue color which is 
proportional to the ammonia concentration. The color is intensified by adding sodium 
nitroprusside. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is added to the buffer to prevent 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
49 
 precipitation of calcium and magne sium in the lines of the instrument. The absorbance is 
measured at 660 nm and is proportional to the TKN in the sample.  
 
TKN is the sum of the ammonium and the organic nitrogen in the sample.  
 
Organic nitrogen concentration is obtained by subtracting the f ree-ammonia 
concentration from the TKN concentration. The total nitrogen in the samples can be 
obtained by adding the TKN and the nitrate plus nitrite (NOx) concentrations.  
 
TP colorimetric analysis:  
 
The total phosphorus is analyzed using the Lachat 8500 Quickchem autoanalyzer. The 
orthophosphate produced in the digestion reacts with ammonium molybdate and 
antimony potassium tartrate under acidic conditions to form a complex. This complex is 
subsequently reduced with ascorbic acid to form a blue complex. T he absorbance of this 
complex is measured at 880 nm and is proportional to the orthophosphate in the sample.  
 
INTERFERENCES  
 
● Samples must not consume more than 10% of the sulfuric acid during the digestion. The 
buffer will accommodate a small range of H 2SO4 concentrations in the digested, diluted 
samples with no change in signal intensity.  
● Digests must be free of turbidity. Digested samples may be filtered if turbid.  
● Some boiling stones have been shown to crumble upon vigorous vortexing. Care must be 
taken to avoid collecting boiling stone pieces when pouring samples into 50 ml tubes.

 SAMPLE COLLECTION AN D PRESERVATION:  
 
See QAM for sample acceptance criteria. Samples (100 – 250 ml) are collected in clean, acid rinsed plastic 
bottles or tubes (see above). Samplers must wear gloves and be careful not to touch any unclean surfaces 
with gloves before or duri ng sampling. Samples may be collected from Niskin bottles or may be directly 
collected from river, stream, estuary, or other water source. If possible, rinse bottle with sample:  
• Bottles must be filled with a volume of sample sufficient to rinse the bottle (for a 
100 ml bottle 10 -20 ml is adequate}.  
• Collect a small amount of sample, cap bottle, invert,  and swirl sample in bottle to 
rinse the entire inner surface of the bottle.  
•  Dispose of rinse water downstream of the sampling site.  
• Rinse 3 times, then fil l the bottle and cap.  
If acid preservative has been added to bottles prior to sampling, do not rise bottle.  
Fill bottle Immediately store samples in the cooler.   
Collected samples must be kept in the dark on ice until delivery to the laboratory.  
If samp les are not preserved in the field, they must be preserved upon arrival at the laboratory.  
Samples are preserved by adding sufficient sulfuric acid  to lower the pH to < 2.0 within 8 hours of 
collection (about 0.4 ml per 100 ml of sample).  
Check the pH of  at least 2 samples per batch to determine that pH is lower than 2 after acid addition.  
Sample Storage:  
Samples should be analyzed as soon as possible after collection.  Preserved sa mples may be stored at <6ºC 
in a refrigerator for up to 28 days.

CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION  
Instrument function is tested before analyzing digested samples and standards, with blank reagent water 
and at least 2 concentrations of undigested CAL for each analyte. An undigested QCCS is also analyzed to 
confirm the accuracy of the laboratory made standards. This ensures the proper functioning of the 
instrument before the digested samples are analyzed. Each digestion and therefore, each analytical batch, 
contains a standard series, duplicate LCS and blanks. These are used to calibrate the instrument for the 
digested samples. More detail can be found in the “ Quality Control” section of this SOP.  
 
Procedure:  
 
Digestion Procedure:  
 
● Note: The following samples must be included in each digestion run:  
○ Duplicate spiked (0.5 mg/l) samples.  
○ Duplicate blanks (0 std).  
○ One replicate sample for every 10 samples.  
○ Standards in duplicate: 0 (blank), 0.05 (TP) or 0.1(TKN), 0.25, 0.5, 1 , 2.0 mg/l standards 
(mixed N and P). Note: higher standards only need to be prepared if a sample is known to 
have higher than typical N or P. Samples with expected TKN or TP concentrations higher 
than 5 mg/l will require dilution.  
○ Duplicate QCCS.  
● The foll owing samples are periodically required (see Quality Control).  
○ Proof of capability, spike 0.5 mg/l to milliQ water for 4 reps.  
○ Proficiency standards: Dilute 1:1000. Use this dilution as a sample. (100 microliters in 100 
ml). Or follow other specific instr uctions from PT provider . 
● Make up all reagents listed in the “Reagents” section of the SOP and the primary standards, no 
later than the day before analysis. If solutions will not be used the next day, store in the MWQL 
chemical refrigerator. If they will b e used the next day, they may be stored at room temperature.  
● Prepare all glassware, plasticware and check the status of all required equipment.  
○ Change any pump tubing that looks worn or misshapen. Refer to the diagrams in Appendix 
A. 
● On the day of the digestion, make up working standards listed in Table 1.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
57 
 ● Make a certified standard mix using the ICPMS standards which are 1000 mg/l ammonium - N 
(Sigma ICPMS std #89503) and (1000 mg/l PO 4-P (Sigma ICPMS std # 38338).  
● Note: Some primary ICPMS stocks are 1 000 mg/l - P and some are 1000 mg/l PO 4. See note below 
for volumes of each.  
○ Make a stock standard mix (62.5 mg/l):  
■ Using a 10 ml volumetric add the following volumes of stock:  
● 0.625 ml of the NH 4 stock.  
● 0.625 ml of the PO 4 stock if using primary with 1000  mg/l P.  If using stock 
with 1000 mg/l PO 4, Add 1.917 ml of stock.  
● Bring to 10 ml with milliQ.  
○ Add 200 microliters (0.2 ml) to each 25 ml sample for spike (500 ug/l).  
○ Add 200 microliters (0.2 ml) to 25 ml milliQ water for QCCS.  
● Note: Undigested CAL standards and LCS must be made up on the day of the analysis to verify 
that the instrument is in working order before analyzing the digested standards.  
○ To make up the undigested LCS in diluent on the day of analysis:  
■ Make up the secondary stock of ICPMS st andards using the instructions above.  
■ To make a 0.5 mg/l working standard, add 0.8 ml of the secondary stock to a 100 
ml flask.  
■ Fill the flask to the mark with diluent.  
○ To make up the undigested CAL standards on the day of analysis:  
■ To make 2 mg/l CAL Stan dard:  
● Add 4 ml of the ammonium primary stock to a 100 ml flask.  
● Add 0.8 ml of the phosphate primary stock to the flask.  
● Dilute to the make with diluent solution.  
● Turn on hood ventilation.  
● Verify sample preservation by measuring pH of at least one of the sa mples in the batch. pH should 
be 2 plus or minus 0.2 units.  
● Use TKN/ TP digestion template (see appendix) to record the rack position of samples and 
standards in the digestor rack.  
● Pour or pipet, 25 mL of standard or sample into respective glass digestion tube (each tube has a 
fill line at the 25 ml mark).  
● Place digestion tubes, uncovered, in the digest rack in the hood.  
● Add 2 Hangar boiling chips to each tube.  
● Once this is complete and all tubes have sample or standard and boiling chips, turn on the digester 
and start the program called TKN (H). It will take appr oximately 20 to 25 minutes for the block to 
reach 200 degrees C.  
● Add 10 mL of Digest Reagent (Reagent #1) to each tube using 10 ml pipette (this will take less than 
20 minutes).  
● Once the block reaches 200 degrees C lower the rack with tubes into the heatin g block, the 
program will maintain that temperature for 70 minutes and then ramp up to 380 degrees C over 
the course of an hour.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
58 
 ● Place cold fingers on the tubes after the digest has been at 200 degrees C for 70 minutes. Don't 
wait too long as temperature ramps up to 380 degrees C. The digest will incubate for 60 minutes 
at 380 degrees C.  
● Label acid cleaned 50 mL conical tubes with proper identification including batch #, date and 
sample location and sample ID.  
● Once the digest is complete, carefully lift t he rack of tubes out of the heating block and allow it to 
cool for approximately 5 -8 minutes.  
● Once cooled, using a squirt bottle, add Milli -Q water to the tube until the level is back 25mL. 
Vortex sample for at least 20 seconds. Note: the longer the sampl es sit after digestion, the more 
difficult it is to suspend the precipitate in the bottom of the tube. It is important that all precipitate 
is mixed into solution. It may take longer to vortex the last samples than the first samples to be 
removed from the rack.  
○ It is important to start processing samples containing saltwater first as they tend to cool 
and form a precipitate that may require minutes of vortexing.  
○ Work with one tube at a time by first taking off the cold finger and immediately bringing 
volum e back to 25mL with a Milli -Q squirt bottle. Once the sample is vortexed and 
transferred to the appropriate tube, move on to the next sample.  
● Pour the suspended sample into an acid -cleaned and  labeled 50 ml disposable centrifuge  tube.  
● Note: if the diges ted sample is turbid, filter through a 0.2-micron  syringe filter.  
○ Filtering procedure for turbid samples.  
■ Filter at least one ml of sample to waste to rinse the filter before collecting filtered 
digested sample.

PHOSPHO RUS ANALYSIS PROCEDURE  
 
Analysis of TKN and TP digested samples.  
TKN is Channel 2 on the MWQL Lachat QuikChem 8500 #1.  
TKP is Channel 3 on the MWQL Lachat QuikChem 8500 #1.  
Analytical steps:  
● Turn on power to autoanalyzer, autosampler, and pump.  
● Turn on the computer.  
● Open the Lachat software  
● Open the TKN/TP method or a run file from a previous TKN/TP run.  
● Enter the identifiers for the standard curve and certified standards in the sample run template.  
● Put all reagent intake lines in the dedicated bottle of  milliQ water.  
● Note: If pump tubing needs to be changed, refer to diagram in Appendix A.  
● Put channel effluent lines into the water collection bottle.  
● Make sure that the sample line is attached to the TKN sample valve.  
● Load tubing into pump channels.  
● Makin g sure that tabs on pump cartridges are all the way to the left, push down on the cartridge 
to secure. Each side of the cartridge will make a “click” as it locks in.  
● Tighten pressure controls on pump cartridges by pushing tab all the way to the right and t hen 
back to the left until it clicks in place.  
● Turn on the pump and set the speed to 35.  
● Check for leaks and other problems.  
● Reduce pump speed to less than 5.  
● Pump milliQ water through lines until baseline is stable, at least a half hour.  
● Remove manifold  waste lines from the water collection bottle and put them into the chemical 
waste carboy, making sure that the end of the tubing is above the waste level. Cover opening 
tightly with parafilm. Set cap on top of carboy to prevent loss.  
● Cut parafilm to cover  all reagent bottles.  
● Be sure to save subsampled a 50 ml Falcon tube of TKN diluent carrier to run as an analytical blank 
before putting reagent line in the carrier bottle.  
● Starting with the line lowest on the diagram in Appendix A, remove intake lines fro m water and 
put them in corresponding reagent bottles, covering each with parafilm as you proceed. Do this 
for both TKN reagents and TKP reagents. Note: carrier for TKN is diluent solution, for TP it is milliQ 
water.  
● Set up a run containing the following.   
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
60 
 ○ Two samples of  milliQ water which will be used to give the system a final rinse before 
analysis.  
○ At least 2 mixed calibration standards of 0.5 mg/l and 2 mg/l of both Ammonium -N and 
phosphate -P in diluent to test the method and ensure that the instrument is working 
properly.  
 
○ A diluent blank.  
○ A QCCS containing 0.5 mg/l of both Ammonium - N and phosphate - P made up in diluent.  
● Put rinse tubes, blanks,  and standards in the autosampler rack.  
● Turn the speed back to 35.  
● Start the “Preview” to look a t the baseline.  
● Once the baseline is stable, end the preview and start the sample run.  
● Graph the response for the blank (0 mg/l), 0.5 mg/l and 2 mg/l of analyte to check linearity of 
instrument response.  
● Use these curves to test instrument function and set  the integration parameters for the analysis.  
● Calculate the concentration of the laboratory control check standard from the equations 
produced.  
● If standard curves are not linear or certified sample recovery deviates more than 10% from 
certified value, re solve before proceeding with digested sample run.  
● Once standard curve, blanks and certified standards are finished and determined to be 
satisfactory, digested samples can be analyzed.  
○ Note:  Although we try to minimize contamination, the diluent does cont ain some P, this 
will show up in the blank for P in the digested blank.  
● Analyze digested QC samples and standards first. If standards are not linear or digested QCCS 
measured concentration falls outside of accepted values, stop the analysis,  and remedy th e 
problem before analyzing environmental samples.  
● If standards are satisfactory, analyze environmental samples.  
● Once analysis is finished, return all lines to milliQ. Switch reagent lines to water starting with the 
reagent at the top of the Lachat manifol d diagram and working downward.  
● Rinse with milliQ water for at least 15 minutes.  
● When finished rinsing, turn off the pump, release tubing from pump cartridges and remove tubing 
intakes from water.  
● Remove waste lines from the hazardous waste container and put them into the water collection 
bottle.  
● Cap waste container.

 DATA ANALYSIS AND CALCULATION  
 
The spectrophotometric detectors for TKN and TP form peaks of voltage response which are integrated 
within the software to provide the integrated peak area of the response. This peak area is directly 
proportional to analyte concentration . Note that all data calculations will consider  any sample dilutions 
that may occur in the course of the analysis.  
 
CAL - Standard concentration and peak areas are graphe d with a scatter plot in Excel or another  graphing 
program. A linear regression of the data is calculated. The r -squared value of the standard curve must be 
above .98 for use in this method. If the r -squared value falls below 0.98, then the instrument will  be 
checked for malfunction and the standards will be run again. The linear regression is used to calculate the 
concentration of the analytes in the samples.  
 
Accuracy  - The QCCS or LCS concentration is calculated using the linear regression obtained from  the CAL 
standard regression. The accuracy of the CAL standards is calculated as follows:  
(ABS(QCCS/LCS certified concentration - QCCS/LCS measured concentration)/QCCS/LCS certified 
concentration) * 100  
 
Precision - The percent error for replicate samples or standards (including FD, LD, QCCS, LCS or CAL 
standards) is calculated using the absolute value of the difference between each of the duplicate  using 
the following equation:  
 
Variability Rep =(Error/Sample Mean) x 100,  
Error = (ABS(Rep1 -Rep2))/2  
 
Perce nt Recovery : 
 
The percent recovery of the replicate spiked samples (LFSM) is calculated using the following equations:  
% Spike Recovery = Mean(Recovery 1, Recovery 2) 
Recovery 1 = ((Analyte Spike1 - Analyte S1 )/Calculated concentration of spike) x 100.  
Recover y1 = ((Analyte Spike2 - Analyte S2 )/Calculated concentration of spike) x 100.  
Analyte S1 = Measured concentration of sample 1.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
62 
 Analyte Spike1 = Measured concentration of sample1 spike.  
Analyte S2  = Measured concentration of sample 2.  
Analyte Spike2= Measured concentration of sample 2 spike.  
 
 
 
 
 
Minimum Detection Limit:  
 
The minimum detection limit is calculated from the error of seven blanks or 7 low concentration 
standards, whichever is largest. See quality control section above for more details.  
The minimum detection limit is calculated as follows:  
1. Calculate the concentrations of the 7 blank replicates and the 7 spikes using the CAL standard 
curve.  
2. Calculate the mean of the 7 blanks. If it is negative, equate it to zero.  
3. Calculate the sta ndard deviation of the 7 blanks.  
4. Multiply the standard deviation of the 7 blanks by 3.143.  
5. Add the mean of the 7 blanks to the result from line 4.  
6. Calculate the standard deviation of the 7 spikes.  
7. Multiply the standard deviation of the 7 spikes by 3.143.  
8. The minimum detection limit is the greater of line 5 and line 7.

 Corrective Actions:  
General precision problems:  
If baseline drifts, peaks are too wide, or other problems with precision arise:  
● Check that there is not an obstruction in the tubing that is causing pressure buildup and retarding 
the flow of the carrier.  
● Check flow of reagents. ‘If reagent is no t flowing properly:  
○ Replace pump tubing.  
○ Check all fittings for obstructions or crimping tubing.  
● If the above actions do not alleviate the problem, clean the manifold by the following procedure:  
○ Place transmission lines in water and pump to clear reagents (2-5 
minutes).  
● Place reagent lines in 1 M hydrochloric acid (1 volume of HCl added  
to 11 volumes of water) and pump for several minutes.  
● Place all transmission lines in water and pump for several minutes.  
● Resume pumping reagents.  
 
Turbidity:  
Despite precautions taken to prevent this, Kjeldahl digests may contain some turbidity. To prevent the 
turbidity from interfering in the analysis, the following are recommended:  
● Pour the diluted digests into the sample tubes, and allow them to settle  
prior to anal ysis.  
●  Set the probe height up from the bottom of the autosampler tube, so it does not hit the bottom 
to avoid aspirating the settled material.  
● Let samples sit until the next day.  
○ Pour them into bottles, cap tightly, and store in the refrigerator overnight . The turbidity 
will settle, so there is very little to none when you decant (carefully) the next day.  
● If samples must be analyzed quickly, centrifugation of the sample tubes to  
speed the settling process can be used.  
● To test whether turbidity is adding to  the signal (by scattering light), replace the hypochlorite with 
water to prevent color formation (for TKN) or use DI water in place of the color reagent (TKP).  
 
Weak or inconsistent signal:  
● Reagents should be made up the day before. Freshly made reagents can give variable results.  
● If excessive bubbles form:  
○  Degas  reagents.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
69 
 ○ Check junctions for loose fittings.  
○ Check pump tubing. Replace worn tubing.  
○ Check intake tubing in bottles.  
Poor precision:  
● If replicate digested standards or samples vary by more than 10% from mean values:  
○ Analyze undigested CAL standards and LCS  to determine if the problem is with the 
analysis or the digestion step.  
○ If problem is also present in undigested samples:  
■ Check pump tubing.  
■ Check back pressure tubing for leaks.  
■ Check fo r bubbles.  
■ Let the instrument equilibrate longer (inadequate equilibration can cause 
variability).  
■ Check for blockages in lines.  
○ If problem does not occur with undigested CAL standards and LCS:  
■ Analyze other replicate standards and samples from digestion.

MANAGEMENT  
 
● All wastes will be handled in accordance with University of Maine Safety and Environmental 
Management Guidelines.  
● Waste will be stored in properly labeled containers with secondary containment.  
● Waste will be located in approved areas and will be inspecte d weekly.  
● When waste containers are full, they will be transported by the Darling Marine Center Safety 
Officer to a secure dedicated waste storage facility on the DMC campus.  
● At the point of pick up and transport to the DMC waste storage facility, the re sponsibility for 
monitoring of the waste is transferred to the DMC safety officer.  
●  Waste will be stored until pickup by a University of Maine approved waste disposal company. All 
MWQL staff who handle waste will be required to complete the Hazardous Wast e training 
provided by the University of Maine.

 2. Definitions  
The definitions and purposes below are specific to this method but have been conformed to 
common usage as much as possible.  
ANALYST - The designated individual who performs the “hands -on” analytical methods and 
associated techniques and who is t he one responsible for applying required laboratory practices 
and other pertinent quality controls to meet the required level of quality.  
ANALYTICAL BATCH -- An analytical batch is a group of environmental samples that are prepared 
and/or analyzed together  with the same process and personnel, using the same lot(s) of reagents. 
A batch is composed of at least one and no more than 20 environmental sample(s) of the same 
quality systems matrix, meeting the above -mentioned criteria and with a maximum time 
betwee n the start of processing of the first and last sample in the batch to be 24 hours. An 
analytical batch is composed of prepared environmental samples (extracts, digestates or 
concentrates) which are analyzed together as a group. An analytical batch can inc lude prepared 
samples originating from various quality system matrices and cannot exceed 20 samples.  
CALIBRATION --  A set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship 
between values or quantities indicated by a measuring inst rument or measuring system, or 
values represented by a material measure or a reference material, and the corresponding values 
realized by standards. In calibration of support equipment, the values realized by standards are 
established through the use of re ference standards that are traceable to the International System 
of Units (SI).  
CALIBRATION BLANK (CB) -- A volume of 90% acetone in the same matrix as the calibration 
standards, but without the analyte.  
CALIBRATION STANDARD (CAL) -- A solution prepared from the primary dilution standard solution 
or stock standard solutions. The CAL solutions are used to calibrate the instrument response with 
respect to analyte concentration.  
CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL -- (CRM) means reference material, accompanied by a 
certificate, having a value, measurement of uncertainty and stated metrological traceability chain 
to a national metrology institute. This method uses a solid standard.  
CHAIN OF CUSTODY FORM (COC) - A rec ord, either paper -based or electronic, that documents 
the possession of the samples from the time of collection to receipt in the laboratory in 
accordance with chain -of-custody protocol. This record, at a minimum, must include the sample 
location, the numb er and types of containers, the mode of collection, the collector, the date and 
time of collection, preservation, and requested analyses.  
FIELD BLANK (FB) -- An aliquot of reagent water or equivalent neutral reference material treated 
as a sample in all a spects, including exposure to a sample bottle holding time, preservatives, and 
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
76 
 all pre -analysis treatments. The purpose is to determine if the field or sample transporting 
procedures and environments have contaminated the sample.  
FIELD DUPLICATE (FD) -- Two samples taken at the same time and place under identical 
circumstances which are treated identically throughout field and laboratory procedures. Analysis 
of field duplicates indicates the precision associated with sample collection, preservation, and 
storage, as well as with laboratory procedures.  
LABORATORY BLANK (LB) -- An aliquot of reagent water or equivalent neutral reference material 
treated as a sample in all aspects, except that it is not taken to the sampling site. The purpose is 
to determine if the if analytes or interferences are present in the laboratory environment, the 
reagents, or the apparatus.  
LABORATORY CONTROL STANDARD (LCS) -- A solution prepared in the laboratory by dissolving a 
known amount of one or more pure compounds in a known amo unt of reagent water. Its purpose 
is to assure that the results produced by the laboratory remain within the acceptable limits for 
precision and accuracy. (This should not be confused with a calibration standard).  
LABORATORY DUPLICATE (LD) -- Two aliquots of the same environmental sample treated 
identically throughout a laboratory analytical procedure.  
LABORATORY FORTIFIED SAMPLE MATRIX  (LFSM) -- An environmental sample containing an 
analyte spike of known concentration at least 4 times the MDL. Used to ev aluate the effect of 
the sample matrix on the analytical results.  
LIMIT OF QUANTITATION  (LOQ) -- The minimum levels, concentrations,  or quantities of a target 
variable (e.g., target analyte) that can be reported with a specified degree of confidence.  
METH OD DETECTION LIMIT (MDL) aka Limit of Detection (LOD) aka Minimum Detection Limit -- 
The lowest level at which an analyte can be detected with 99 percent confidence that the analyte 
concentration is greater than zero.  
MilliQ WATER - Reagent water that has been treated to remove impurities through reverse 
osmosis and filtration and has a resistivity above 18.0 .  
QUALITY CONTROL CHECK SAMPLE (QCCS) -- A sample containing analytes of interest at known 
concentrations (true values) of analytes. The QCCS is obta ined for a source external to the 
laboratory or is prepared from standards obtained from a different source than the calibration 
standards. The purpose is to check laboratory performance using test materials that have been 
prepared independently from the n ormal preparation process. Also known  as the Proficiency 
Standard.  
RELATIVE STANDARD DEVIATION (RSD) – The standard deviation expressed as a fraction of the 
mean.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
77 
 3. Quality Control Measures:  
All laboratory personnel using this SOP will also comply with a ll general laboratory QA and QC measures 
as stated elsewhere in this QAM. QA and QC procedures specific to this protocol are documented in this 
SOP.  
3A. Initial Demonstration of performance:  
• Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) – Note that this method follows th e procedure 
documented in 40 CFR Part 136 and outlined in “Definition and Procedure for the 
Determination of the Minimum Detection Limit, Rev. 2 (EPA 821 -R-16-006).  
o Estimate the initial MDL using the mean determined concentration plus three 
times the stan dard deviation of a set of method blanks.  
o To determine the ongoing MDL, choose a concentration between 2 -10 times the 
estimated initial MDL.  
o Spike a minimum of 7 samples with the chosen concentration of standard.  
o In addition, analyze a minimum of 7 blan ks.  
o The seven spiked samples and seven blanks must be analyzed on a minimum of 3 
days.  
o Calculate the MDL of the spiked samples.  
▪ MDL  (spiked samples) = the students t -value appropriate for a single -
tailed 99th percentile t statistic and a standard deviation estimate with n -1 
degrees of freedom, times the standard deviation of the replicate spike.  
o Calculate the MDL of the blanks.  
▪ MDL (blanks) = The mean of the method blanks times the student’s t -value 
appropria te for the single -tailed 99th percentile t statistic and a standard 
deviation estimate with n -1 degrees of freedom times the standard 
deviation of the method blanks.  
o Select the greater of the spiked sample MDL and the blank MDL.  
• Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)  – The limit of quantitation will be determined by multiplying 
the standard deviation of the spiked samples by the student’s t -value appropriate for a 
double -tailed 99th percentile t statistic and a standard deviation estimate with n -1 degrees 
of freedom. If the LOQ calculated by the above method is less than 2 times the MDL, then 
the LOQ = two times the MDL.  
• Proficiency Standard (PT) - Annually, a PT will be ordered from an EPA recommended provider 
lab. The sample will be analyzed, and results sent to the provider lab. If results are not within the 
acceptable limits of stated values, the source of the problem will be identified and corrected. Also 
known  as the QCCS.  
• Demonstration of Linearity - A standard curve over the working range (0.186 -60 micrograms/l)  of 
the method will be analyzed annually to demonstrate linearity.  
• Proof of Capability (POC): All staff performing SM10200 H, must demonstrate capability:  
o In a brown bottle, collect 1-liter clean matrix.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
78 
 o Subsample 4 separate 100 ml samples using a Class A  or lab calibrated graduated cylinder, 
being sure to mix the sample before taking each subsample.  
▪ Filter these samples, process,  and analyze following the documented protocol.  
o Subsample 4 additional 100 ml samples, being sure to mix the sample before taki ng each 
subsample.  
▪ Filter these samples following the documented protocol.  
▪ Spike these samples immediately following the addition of acetone solution, with 
a concentration of chlorophyll certified standard to give a final concentration in 
the extract of 1 0 - 20 µg/l.  
o The % spike recovery and the standard deviation must be within 80 -120% of the spiked 
concentration.  
 
3B. Ongoing Quality Control Measures:  
● Laboratory Blanks – One laboratory reagent blank consisting of milliQ water filtered and 
extracted in th e same manner as the samples, will be analyzed for each batch of 10 
samples. Blanks must be lower than the LOQ.  
●  Laboratory Control Standard – A solid chlorophyll a standard will be analyzed along with 
each batch of samples. If the LCS varies by more than 10% from the value recorded during 
the previous calibration, then a new calibration standard will be ordered,  and the 
instrument will be recalibrated.  
● Calibration Standards – Calibration standards will be ordered twice per year or when the 
LCS solid standa rd varies by more than 10% from the readings obtained during the 
previous calibration.  
● Laboratory Duplicates - A set of LDs will be analyzed for every 20 samples. Duplicates 
should not vary more than 20% if the concentration is greater than 3 times the LOQ. 
Replicate samples whose concentration is below 3 times the LOQ, may have higher than 
20% variability.  
● Proof of Capability: Each analyst will perform  a proof of capability once per year or when 
method changes are made or if problems arise with an analy st’s work. See detailed 
procedure above.  
4. Summary of Method:  
A known volume of a water sample is filtered through a 25 mm glass fiber filter using low vacuum 
filtration. Filters are placed in a solution of 90% acetone, sonicated for 5 minutes and then extracted for 
greater than 4 and less than 20 hours at 4 degrees centigrade (4°C  ±). Samples are centrifuged to clarify 
the extract. A subsample of the supernatant extract is transferred to a second tube for analysis. The tube 
is placed into the chamber of a Turner Trilogy fluorometer,  and the raw fluorescence is recor ded. The 
sample is then acidified, and a second fluorescence reading is taken. From these 2 readings, the corrected 
chlorophyll a and phaeophytin concentrations are derived.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
79 
 5. Interferences:  
● Filter residue and particulate matter can interfere with the fl uorescence readings. Use caution not 
to disturb the sample while removing from centrifuge and pipetting off the supernatant. Do not 
pipette from the bottom of the extraction tube.  
● Light can degrade chlorophyll. All steps of the process should be conducted with limited light, 
including during freezer storage, refrigerator storage, extraction,  and analysis.  
● Fluorescence readings change with the temperature of the sample. All extracted samples and 
liquid standards must be at room temperature when analyzed for  fluorescence to avoid 
temperature derived variability or condensation on the fluorometer tubes.  
● Dirty glass tubes can cause inaccurate readings. Glass chlorophyll tubes are either used straight 
from the box after each batch has been verified to be clean o r washed thoroughly with laboratory 
detergent, rinsed with milliQ water,  and rinsed with 90% acetone before use.  
 
6. Safety:  
Hazards:  
This protocol requires the use of hazardous chemicals. All laboratory personnel using this 
protocol must be current with a ll University of Maine safety training requirements.  
This protocol requires the use of a sonicator for which staff must receive specific instrument 
training. Improper use of the sonicator can damage hearing.  
This protocol requires the use of a vacuum pump  which if used improperly can cause vacuum 
carboys to implode. Read all instructions for use of pump.  
Hazardous chemicals : Read SDS sheet for all chemicals before use. Wear appropriate personal 
protective equipment including appropriate gloves, lab coat an d safety glasses. The following 
list highlights some of the hazards of the listed chemicals but IS NOT intended to replace 
thorough reading of the SDS sheets by laboratory personnel.  
● Hydrochloric Acid (CAS#: 7647 -01-0). Corrosive. Toxic.  
● Acetone (CAS#: 67 -64-1). Flammable. Toxic.

8. Labware Cleaning:  
• Brown collection bottles are cleaned with laboratory detergent and rinsed with milliQ water.  
• New glass tubes do not normally need to be washed before first use. Ba tches are initially checked 
for cleanliness by extracting and analyzing blanks using replicates from a batch of tubes.  
• After use, tubes are washed with laboratory detergent, rinsed with milliQ, rinsed with 90% 
acetone,  and left inverted in the fume hood to  dry.  
• Cuvettes are not required for this method because the Trilogy fluorometers are designed to read 
samples in the glass tubes.  
• Labware must not be acid cleaned for this method.

  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
81 
 9. Sample Collection and Preservation:  
 
Sample Collection:  
● A MWQL Chai n of Custody form must be filled out for each batch of samples.  
● Samples (250 - 1000 ml) are collected in laboratory detergent cleaned and milliQ rinsed, brown 
plastic bottles.  
● Samplers must wear gloves and be careful not to touch any unclean surfaces with gloves before 
or during sampling.  
● Samples may be collected from Niskin bottles or directly from river, stream, estuary, or other 
water source.  
● Collection of the sample:  
○ Rinse collection bottle with sample.  
■ Fill the bottle with a volume of sample sufficient to rinse the interior of the bottle 
(for a 100 ml bottle, 10 ml is adequate).  
■ Cap bottle, invert, and swirl sample in the bottle to rinse the entire inner surface 
of the bottle.  
■  Dispose of rinse water do wnstream of the sampling site.  
■ Repeat 2 times.  
○ Fill the bottle to the neck and cap.  
○ If sampling from a Niskin bottle, be sure to gently mix the water in the Niskin, before 
drawing the subsample.  
Sample Storage:  
• Store samples in the cooler, in the dark, with ice packs immediately after collection.  Samples in 
collection bottles must remain below 4 degrees Centigrade, in the dark, until filtered.  
• If water samples are collected from bodies of water that may have a pH lower than 6, for instance 
some freshwat er bodies, the pH of the sample must be measured when samples arrive in the 
laboratory. If pH is less than 6, then samples must be extracted promptly after filtration.  
● All samples must be filtered within 6 hours of collection.  
● Except where noted above for  low pH samples, filtered samples (contained on glass fiber filters) 
may be stored for up to 20 days after filtration at -20 degrees Centigrade.

 10. Reagents and Standards:  
6. MilliQ water – Record water resistivity and temperature.  
a. Resistivity greater than 18.0.  
b. Water is pretreated with particulate and carbon filters, passed through a reverse osmosis 
membrane, filtered through a Millipore milliQ  or similar clean water system and filtered 
through a final particulate filter before us e. 
7. 90% Acetone: Studies have shown that excess magnesium carbonate can actually degrade 
chlorophyll by -products due to adsorption of the pigments to the magnesium carbonate (Aminot 
and Rey, 2001). Because seawater contains magnesium and carbonate, we do no t make up the 
90% acetone with magnesium carbonate or add magnesium carbonate to seawater samples. This 
is standard for oceanographic chlorophyll measurements.  
a. Seawater Samples  
i. Make 1 liter of aqueous acetone solution (Note that if you are only analyzing a 
small amount of sample, make a lesser amount. Solution lasts for one month).  
1. Using the dedicated Class A 100 ml volumetric flask, measure 100 ml of 
milliQ water.  
2. Add milliQ water to the dedicated Class A 1 -l flask.  
3. In the fume hood, fill the 1-liter flask to the mark with HPLC Grade 
Acetone.  
4. Cap and invert to mix.  
5. Transfer solution to 1 -liter brown glass bottle with dispenser top.  
6. Make sure that cover is on dispenser tip when not in use.  
7. Log reagent in the MWQL Reagent Tracking Log.  
8. Use acetone in the hoo d. 
b. Fresh Water Samples:  
i. If samples are collected from fresh water and the pH of the water is less than 6, 
the 90% acetone should be made up as follows:  
1. Add 100 ml of the following MgCO 3 solution to a 1 -liter flask.  
a. MgCO 3 solution:  
i. Add 1 g of finely powder ed magnesium carbonate to 100 
ml of distilled or higher -grade water.  
2. In the fume hood, fill flask to the mark with HPLC Grade Acetone.  
3. Cap and invert to mix.  
4. Pour solution into 1 -liter brown bottle with dispenser top or a brown 
glass bottle with Teflon cap.  
5. Make sure that cover is on dispenser tip when not in use.  
6. Record acetone solution in Reagent Tracking Log.  
7. Use acetone in the hood.

 8. Standards . 
a. Certified liquid chlorophyll a standards are available for purchase . The Turner certified 
standard comes as two solutions, one with a high and one with a low concentration. For example, 
lot # CAS165 -01 contained a high standard with a concentration of 240 micrograms/l, and a low 
concentration of 25.1 micrograms/l of chlorophyll a.  These standards are di luted with 90% 
acetone solution in the lab to make a standard series from approximately 0.05 
micrograms/liter to 60 micrograms/l or higher. Liquid standards are expensive and have 
a limited shelf life; solid standards are used for daily verification.

instrument drift. The solid standard is analyzed with every batch of samples. If a change 
in fluorescence readings occurs of 10% or greater from the reading at the last calibration, 
a new liquid certified standard instrument calibration is performed.

11. Calibration and standardization:   
● The instrument is calibrat ed with a certified liquid standard twice per year, when problems arise, 
or if a change of greater than 10% in fluorescence readings of the solid chlorophyll standard 
occurs. Certified liquid chlorophyll standards are expensive and do have a limited shelf life, so it 
is important to prepare properly before ordering and diluting standards. To calibrate:  
○ Turn on the spectrofluorometer and allow to warm up for at least 30 minutes.  
○ Remove standards from freezer and allow to come to room temperature, in the dar k. 
○ In subdued lighting, the fume hood, carefully dilute the liquid standards with 90% 
acetone, roughly following the dilutions in Table 1, above. Note that each batch of 
certified standard is a different concentration, so dilutions will be slightly differe nt for 
each batch.  
○ Analyze a series of at least 10 acetone blanks. These blanks will be used as a baseline to 
verify instrument performance and for MDL determination.  
○ Obtain a fluorescence reading from each standard concentration.  
■ Dilution of the certified standard should continue until obtaining a fluorescence 
reading of approximately 3 times the blank average.  
○ Acidify several of the samples to obtain the ratio of unacidified to acidified pure 
chlorophyll.  
■ After obtaining an initi al raw fluorescence reading, add 0.1 N Hydrochloric Acid 
to each sample to make an HCL concentration of 0.003 N in the final solution.  
■ Mix sample gently.  
■ Allow sample to sit for at least 30 seconds.  
■ Wipe off outside of tube.  
■ Obtain raw fluorescence of acid ified sample.  
○ Immediately before after liquid standard readings are taken, obtain a raw fluorescence 
reading of the solid chlorophyll standard, remove the standard from the cell holder. 
Repeat after 5 minutes. These readings will be used as a baseline to d etect drift.  
○ Record at least one solid standard reading in the Chlorophyll Solid Standard Log each time 
you analyze samples.  
12. Chlorophyll  Analytical Procedure  
• Print out a “Chlorophyll Filtration Log”  and “Chlorophyll Analysis Log” Fill out the relev ant 
information as you proceed through the filtration.  
• If samples will not be extracted immediately, prepare foil packets for chlorophyll filters:  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
85 
 o Cut a rectangular piece of foil large enough to enclose a folded 25 mm filter.  
o Use a Sharpie to label outside  of foil pouch with project name, date, station, depth, 
replicate and any other needed information.  
o Turn down the lights in the laboratory.  
o Prepare filter rig:  
▪ Check carboy to make sure it is not too full.  
• If carboy is ¾ full or more, empty the carboy.  
▪ If using a pump with an oil reservoir, check to make sure that vacuum pump glass 
oil receptacle has pump oil.  
▪ Check vacuum tubing to be sure all connections are tight.  
▪ Open channels on filter rig.  
▪ Rinse each filter cup and base with milliQ water f rom squirt bottle  
▪ Turn on pump to pull water through filter base.  
▪ Place a glass fiber filter on each filter base.  
• A drop of milliQ water placed on the base before adding the filter will 
help hold the filter in place while you attach the cup to the base.  
▪ Attach a filter cup to each base.  
o Filtration (in subdued light):  
▪ Filter 100 -250 ml of seawater through a glass fiber filter using the vacuum 
filtration rig. Note that sample volumes for samples with extremely high 
particulate concentrations may need to be l ess than 100 ml.  
▪ Remove samples from cooler.  
▪ Place each bottle next to the filter station through which it will be filtered.  
▪ Gently invert the bottle three or four times to mix sample. Do not shake, as you 
risk breaking cells.  
▪ Rinse the graduated cylinder with a few ml of sample.  
▪ Cap bottle and mix.  
▪ Repeat the rinse three times.  
▪ Mix sample and fill to the 100 ml mark of the gradated cylinder for most samples. 
  
• If water is exceptionally clear, you may need to filter more sample 
volume.  
• If phytoplankton are in high concentration, the volume filtered may need 
to be reduced.  
• You should be able to see the sample on the filter, if you can’t, filter more 
sample. Keep a tally of the total volume filtered.  
▪ Make sure channel valve is open.  
▪ Pour sample into filtratio n cup.  
▪ Turn on pump and check vacuum.  
• Vacuum should not exceed 20 kPa.  
▪ Do not let filter completely dry out.  
• Turn off channel as sample level gets close to the level of the filter.  
• Turn off pump.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
86 
 • Briefly open and close channel valve to remove any water that may 
remain above filter.  
• Fresh water and low pH samples only:  
o Add 2 ml of MgCO3 solution to each sample just before it is fully 
filtered through the filter.  
▪ To make magnesium carbonate solution, add 1 g of finely 
powdered magnesium carbonate to  100 ml of MilliQ 
water.  
▪ Remove cup from filter station.  
▪ Using forceps, carefully fold filter over onto itself so side with sample is on the 
inside.  
▪ If not starting extraction immediately, place folded filter into foil pouch and fold 
over flaps of pouch t o seal.  
▪ Put pouch in Ziploc bag and store in freezer up to 20 days.  
▪ If extracting immediately, put folded filter into the bottom of the extraction tube.  
▪ Filter one blank of milliQ water for each batch of 10 samples.  
▪ Rinse each filter base and cup with mil liQ between samples.  
▪ Store filters in foil pouches or tubes in subdued light while continuing to filter the 
batch.  
▪ After final filtration, rinse filter cups with 90% acetone in the fume hood. Allow 
to dry in the hood, then rinse with milliQ water.  
o Extracti on: 
▪ Label 2 sets of chlorophyll tubes (extraction tubes with Teflon screw caps and 
small chlorophyll analysis tubes with plastic push -on caps) with electrical tape on 
the upper 1/3 of the tube. Use pencil as acetone will remove ink and Sharpie.  
▪ In subdued lighting and in the hood, place filter into an extraction tube, pushing 
filter to the bottom of tube.  
▪ Using the bottle -top pipette, add 7 ml of 90 % aqueous acetone being careful not 
to splash any of acetone outside of the tube.  
▪ Cap the tube and place in test tube rack.  
▪ When all filters have been placed in tubes and acetone has been added, cover 
entire rack with foil to block light.  
▪ Turn off lights in sonicator room.  
▪ Operator of sonicator must have received training in its use.  
▪ Take sample rack to sonicato r and place rack in water bath.  
▪ Put a small ice pack in the water bath to prevent the water in the bath from 
heating up during sonication. Ice packs are in the freezer of the reagent 
refrigerator.  
▪ The water level in bath must cover the bottom inch of the t ubes.  
▪ Insert small sonicator probe at least 1 “ into the water making sure it does not 
touch rack or sides of bath.  
▪ Put on hearing protection.  
▪ Turn the intensity dial of the sonicator all the way down.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
87 
 ▪ Clear others from the area outside of the sonicator ro om or provide others with 
hearing protection.  
▪ Turn on the power to the sonicator (red push button).  
▪ Gradually turn up intensity to 30.  
▪ Leave room and shut door.  
▪ Either stand outside of room near door to prevent others from entering or place 
“Do Not Enter S onicator in Use” sign on door. If standing next to the door, wear 
hearing protection.  
▪ Sonicate for 5 minutes. For consistency, do not let samples sonicate for less than 
4 ½ minutes or more than 5 ½ minutes.  
▪ After 5 minutes, turn down sonicator intensity.  
▪ Turn off power to sonicator.  
▪ Remove rack from water bath, letting excess water drain into bath.  
▪ Wrap rack in foil and place rack in MWQL sample refrigerator.  
▪ Record temperature of refrigerator. There is a liquid bottle thermometer in each 
refrigerator.  
 
o Fluorometric Analysis:  
▪ After greater than 4 and less than 20 hours of extraction, remove samples from 
refrigerator.  
▪ Allow them to come to room temperature, in a dark cabinet.  
• Turn on Turner Trilogy fluorometer one -half hour before the start of the analysis.  
• Centrifuge samples using the bench -top “swinging bucket’ centrifuge.  
o Make sure that all buckets have small rubber inserts.  
o Equally balance the weight of the bucket collar and the buckets on 
opposite sides of the centrifuge rotor. The weights are embossed on the 
components.  
o Insert tubes into buckets in balanced pairs.  
o Check that the combination of collar, tubes and samples is balanced for 
opposite loads on the rotor.  
▪  Use th e small swinging balance (with red and yellow trays).  
▪ The arrow should be touching the middle mark on the balance.  
▪ If it is off to one side too much, use a squirt bottle to add water 
to the bucket {tube holder} of the side that is too light to bring 
the ar row to the center mark. Note: DO NOT ADD WATER TO THE 
TUBE ITSELF!  
o Insert collars with buckets and tubes into the channel in the rotor.  
o Lock down centrifuge lid.  
o Centrifuge at 1400 rpm (500g) for 20 minutes.  
o The centrifuge motor will stop after 20 minutes  but it will take longer for 
motion to cease. Do not use break but instead wait for centrifuge to stop.  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
88 
 o Remember that opening the lid does not stop the rotor. There is no safety 
to prevent the lid from opening when the centrifuge rotor is spinning. DO 
NOT OPEN THE LID UNTIL THE ROTOR HAS COMPLETELY STOPPED.  
o Once motion has stopped, open lid and remove tubes making sure light 
is diminished in room.  
o Cover rack with foil when not removing or placing tubes in rack.  
• Using a Class A volumetric glass pipet and bu lb, transfer 3 ml from the top of the 
sample extraction tube to a small clean chlorophyll tube.  
• Samples must be at room temperature (they should not feel cold to touch and 
should have no condensation). Temperature variations will cause fluorescence 
variati on, so it is important to make sure that the samples are at room 
temperature (21 degrees centigrade plus or minus 3 degrees centigrade) when 
they are analyzed.  
• Wipe off outside of tubes with a Kimwipe.  
• Place tube in fluorometer, close lid and read fluoresc ence.  
• If sample is at or above 90% of the reported range (roughly 200,000 raw 
fluorescence units on the MWQL Trilogy), dilute and analyze again.  
o Dilute samples by adding sample and 90% acetone to a new tube in the 
proper proportions.  
o  Do not bring the total vol ume to more than 3 ml.  
o Record dilution factor in the Chlorophyll Analysis Log.  
• Remove tube from fluorometer.  
• After all samples have been read, then acidify the samples and read again:  
▪ Add (0.1 ml for the 3 ml subsample) 0.1 N HCl to each sample.  
▪ Acidify s amples in small batches which can be analyzed within the 
3-minute  time frame (see below).  
▪ Cap tube and gently invert to mix acid into sample.  
▪ Do not let samples sit less than 30 seconds or more than 3 
minutes after acid addition before reading.  
 
 
13. Data  Analysis and Calculations:  
Corrected Chlorophyll a and Phaeophytin calculations.  
• The raw fluorescence reading per microgram of chlorophyll (response) is obtained from the slope 
of the linear regression obtained from analysis of liquid certified chlorophyl l a standard.  
• The ratio of the un -acidified raw fluorescence to the acidified raw fluorescence (f0max) of pure 
chlorophyll a is also determined by acidifying the pure chlorophyll standards.  
• f0 is equal to the unacidified raw sample fluorescence.  
• fa is equa l to the acidified raw sample fluorescence.  
• The chlorophyll a concentration is:  
 Kingfis h Maine AWQMP 2022  
  Version 8, 6/1/22 
   
89 
 (response*(f0max/(f0max -1))*(f0 -fa))*((extraction vol. (l)*dilution factor)/vol. filtered (l)  
• The phaeophytin concentration is :  
(response*(f0max/(f0max -1))*(f0max*fa -f0))*(( extraction vol. (l)*dilution factor)/ vol. filtered 
(l)) 
Accuracy  – The accuracy of the chlorophyll a method is determined by yearly QCCS (PT) which are samples 
of know concentration provided by an outside entity which are analyzed blind by the laboratory.  
Precision of Duplicate Samples - The percent error for replicate samples or is calculated using the absolute 
value of the difference between each of the duplicates using the following equation:  
Variability Rep =(Error/Sample Mean) x 100,  
Error = (ABS(Rep1 -Rep2))/2  
Instrument Drift : 
The instrument drift is determined by analyzing the fluorescence signal of a solid standard with every 
batch of samples and comparing its raw fluorescence to that obtained with the same standard at the time 
of the most recent calibration. A running log of solid standard fluorescence is maintai ned in the 
Chlorophyll Solid Standard Fluorescence Log which is located next to the fluorometer.  
Minimum Detection Limit:  
The lowest level at which an analyte can be detected with 99 percent confidence that the analyte 
concentration is greater than zero. S ee “Initial Demonstration of Performance” above for details of 
calculations.  
Limit of Quantitation:  
The limit of quantitation is determined by one of the following methods.  
• Determining the concentration at which the fluorescence signal from the  certified liquid 
chlorophyll sample is equal to three times the blank value.  
• Determine from the  2 tailed t -test for the 99% probability from a set of blanks and a set of spiked 
blanks and choose the larger of the 2 concentrations.  
• Multiply the MDL by 2.

Figure 1. An example of linearity. Raw fluorescence of liquid chlorophyll standard, 8/13/2020.  
15. Corrective Actions:  
General precision problems:  
1. If replicate variability is greater than acceptable limits (20% variability):  
a. Determine if the sample raw fluorescence is above or below 10 times the LOQ:  
i. If it is above 10 times the LOQ:   
1. Rerun samples making sure to mix sample well before subsampling.  
2. Verify that extracted samples are at room temperature before sampling.  
3. Allow 30 minutes for fluorometer to warm up before analyzing samples.  
4. Make sure that acidified samples are well mixed and are allowed to sit 
for 30 seconds after acid addition and mixing.  
5. Check the raw fluorescence of the solid standard to make sure that 
readings h ave not exceeded 10% of what they were at the time of the 
most recent calibration.  
6. If sample variability is still unacceptably high, replace lamp in 
fluorometer.  
ii. If the sample raw fluorescence is below 10 times the LOQ, variability may be 
higher than 20%.  
2. If solid standard varies by more than 10% from the readings at the time of the last calibration:  
a. Check to make sure fluorometer was warmed up for at least one hour.  
b. Check to make sure that solid standard was properly seated and in the correct orientation.  
Improper seating of standard can cause large variations in reading.  
c. Notify lab manager who will clean the instrument chamber.  y = 3427.5x -1034.9

 d. If none of the above actions brings fluorescence readings to within 10% of last calibration: 
replace lamp.  
3. Issues of unfiltered sample temperatures or other procedures being out of specification are dealt 
with in the QAM. If these issues occur with SM 10200 samples or procedures, the QAM protocols 
will be followed.  
16. Pollution Prevention and waste management:  
 
All wastes will be handled in accordance with University of Maine Safety and Environmental Management 
Guidelines. Waste will be stored in properly labeled containers with secondary containment. Waste will 
be located in approved areas and will be inspected weekly. When waste containers are full, they will be 
transported by the Darling Marine Center Safety Officer to a secure dedicated waste storage facility on 
the DMC campus. At the point of pick up and transport to the DMC waste storage facility, the responsibility 
for monito ring of the waste, is transferred to the DMC safety officer.  Waste will be stored until pickup by 
a University of Maine approved waste disposal company. All MWQL staff who handle waste will be 
required to complete the Hazardous Waste training provided by the University of Maine.  
The MWQL is committed to reducing chemical waste and will maintain the lowest volume of chemical 
stocks that is practical while maintaining adequate stock to guard against shortages and back orders. All 
MWQL expired chemicals will  be disposed of as chemical waste and transferred to the DMC waste storage 
facility. The lab does not dispose of any chemicals down the drain.

Secchi Disk Standard Operating Procedure  
Safety Information: Follow all shipboard safety protocols. Operate the disk from a safe and secure 
location  
 
 
Protocol  
1. Prior to using the secchi disk.  
a. Verify the markings on the line are accurate. Use a meter stick to verify the meter 
marks. Measure the distance from the secchi disk to the first mark and record 
(This distance will change if the line is shortened for any reason).  
b. Verify that the line is securely attached to the  disk. 
2. Work on shady side of boat, so that sun is not hitting water above the secchi disk and 
line. If necessary, use an umbrella or other sunshade.  
3. Do not wear sunglasses or glasses that automatically darken in the sun.  
4. Make sure that you are in a safe spot and can maintain your balance.  
5. Before line goes overboard, have someone hold the end of the line or tie the line  
securely to the boat.  
6. Lower disk into the water until white disk pattern disappears. Record the marking on the 
line for depth.  
7. The line should be vertical while making measurements. Be mindful to avoid the line 
getting near the boat propellor in strong current.  In strong currents, extra weights may 
be needed. If weighted secchi disk line is still not vertical note in the field notebook th e 
estimated angle of the line.  
8. Once you have recorded the first depth, lower the disk slightly further.  
9. Raise disk until you can just see the white pattern again. Record the depth.  
10. Average the two readings.  
11. Once ashore, rinse the secchi disk and line in fr esh water and hang on rack to dry.

Megan Sorby
Kingfish Maine
LD 586
Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and members of the Committee on Marine 
Resources, thank you for the opportunity to speak today. 
I’m Megan Sorby, Operations Manager for Kingfish Maine. I’ve been raising multiple
species of fish in several countries over the last 15 years. I graduated with honors 
from University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth 
Science with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology and Chemistry. And I also 
graduated with honors from the University of Stirling with a Master of Science in 
Sustainable Aquaculture. 
I am speaking in opposition of LD 586. 
This bill is redundant of current state statues which manage land based aquaculture 
and attempts to usurp the authority of the Maine Department of Environmental 
Protection. 
Let’s look closely at each proposed standard: 
#1- Degradation of water quality, air quality or increase overall carbon emissions.
Current state statute currently allocates oversight of these standards to the Maine 
DEP, specifically requiring that any type of development may not degrade water 
quality so as to change the classification of the water body. 
By definition, this preserves water quality to the point that existing wildlife, fishing 
and recreational boating are all preserved. 
With respect to carbon emissions, state statute and Maine DEP permitting specifies 
that operators must provide the best practical treatment options.  These are analyzed 
as part of the permitting process and we must demonstrate through alternative 
analysis that adverse impacts are avoided, minimized and mitigated. 
This standard, as outlined in this bill, is arbitrary and pernicious, as everyday human 
activity increases carbon emissions, including when you turned on your stove this 
morning or drove your car on your morning commute. 
#2- Feed Sources
As an aquaculture company, we have a standard of care that ensures the fish are 
raised responsibly. It is our duty to provide complete nutrition to our fish that's 
adequate for their needs.
All ingredients used in fish feeds, including those used in RAS, are currently 
regulated by the FDA and are either derived from domestic fisheries or are subject to 
a variety of import controls. 
It’s important to note that marine-derived ingredients are in no way exclusive to 
recirculating aquaculture systems. 
To single out a specific production system for its use of a legal and commonly used 
feed ingredient in this way calls into question the legality and sincerity of the 
proposed policy. 
#3-  Industrial recirculating aquaculture operations may not adversely impact native lobster, 
shellfish, seaweed or finfish operations.
This regulation falls under the current Maine DEP process for RAS and is also 
reviewed by many of these 30+ agencies listed as part of our extensive permitting 
process, including  National Marine Fisheries Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Army 
Corp of Engineers, EPA as well as the regional authorities- New England Fisheries 
Management Council and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. 
Again, aquaculture projects must demonstrate best practicable treatment technology 
and must demonstrate through alternative analysis that adverse impacts are avoided, 
minimized and mitigated. 
This is redundant and repetitive and demonstrates that opponents of aquaculture 
didn’t like the reviewing agencies decisions on their appeals to our permitting. 
In their attempt to stop land based aquaculture at all costs, aquaculture opponents 
refuse to consider the synergies of what our industry can provide to existing fisheries 
and working waterfronts. 
Working as collaborative industries, we can lessen the burden of associated costs and 
increase access to supply chain options in the marine ecosystem.  
In Maine, we will support our local lobstermen and fisheries as we have in the 
Netherlands. One example, our heads, racks, and trimmings have been approved as 
bait for lobstermen and is currently used by some lobstermen in Jonesport. 
Maine’s labor department, community college and University of Maine system are 
putting precious resources into educating and training our young people for a future in
the blossoming aquaculture industry. 
We provide an alternative path and a collaborative resource to grow Maine’s seafood 
brand, bringing economic development to regions who welcome our technology and 
are confident in the existing permitting process and oversight currently provided by 
numerous federal and state agencies, including the Maine DEP.
