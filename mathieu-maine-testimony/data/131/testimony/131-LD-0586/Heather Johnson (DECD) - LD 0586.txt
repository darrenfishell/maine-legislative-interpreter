Testimony of Heather Johnson  
 
In opposition to LD 586  
 
An Act to Protect Maine Fisheries from the Effects of Industrial Recirculating Aquaculture 
Operations  
 
Senator Reny , Representative Hepler , and distinguished members of the Committee o n Marine 
Resources,  I am Heather Johnson, Commissioner of the Department of Economic and 
Community Development . I submit this testimony  in opposition to LD 586 .  
 
The United States currently imports approximately 80% of  its seafood . Global d emand for meat -
based protein has grown and by 2050  is set to double compared to today. Finding climate -
responsible ways to grow that protein will become increasingly important and  can allow us to 
localize the supply chain to reduce dependence on importation.  
 
Maine has an opportunity to be  part of the solution to this growing demand  because of our  high 
standards of water and air quality. It would not be in anyone’s best interest to significantly 
degrade either. Existing fishing and farming practices will need to employ innovative strategies 
and techniques  to meet the demand for protein development as well as offer opportunities for 
Maine people.   
 
Maine has stringent requirements for new RAS facilities. We believe these existing requirements 
work to find the balance of protecting critical natural resources and supporting the seafood 
industry.  
 
The current permitting process includes /may include , depending on  the size of the project : 
Permits and regulations under the Department of Environmental Protection, including  
- A Site Location of Development General Permit  
- A Natural Resources Protection Act License  
- A MEPDES Discharge Permit, with levels of required additional permit review based on 
volume and characteristics of the discharged water  
Permits and regulations under the Department of Marine Resources, including  
- Importation of live marine organisms  
Permits and regulations under the Army Corps of Engineers, including  
- Clean Water Act Section 404 General Permit, Maine  
- Section 10 licensing may also be required  
Local permits and regulations

The Department agrees that regulation of the industry and its impacts is important, and our 
position is that the  current permitting processes and safeguards are sufficient in this rega rd.
