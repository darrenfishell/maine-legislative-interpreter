  Michael Buescher , Esq., Chair  
 TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1400  
 
AN ACT TO ALLOW SOCIAL WORKERS TO DIAGNOSE  
ORGANIC MENTAL ILLNESSES  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services. I am Steven Bailey, executive direc-
tor of the Maine School Boards Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committee of the Maine School Boards Association, in opposition to L.D. 1400.  
 
The definition of a psychosocial assessment is an evaluation of an individual ’s 
mental health and social well -being. It assesses self -perception and the individu-
al’s ability to function in the community.  
 
This bill would allow social workers to do such an assessment.  
 
We are opposed to this legislation because doing such an assessment is not the role 
of social workers nor are they required to have training in this area. That is not fair 
to them or the individuals they would be assessing.
