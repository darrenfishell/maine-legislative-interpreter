LD 1400
Dear Committee members.  I am writing in support of the passage of LD1400.  My 
name is Jeanette Rogers.  I am an LCSW in the State of Maine and employed at 
Northern Light Acadia Hospital full time. I also have a private practice.  My training 
has prepared me to assess and diagnose all disorders in the DSM.  I often have clients 
with ADHD and Autism and feel it has been challenging to complete thorough 
diagnostic evaluations or provide targeted treatments because of this outdated policy.  
It invalidates my clinical skills.  I urge the committee to pass LD1400 to allow social 
workers to diagnose and treat patients with organic mental illnesses so that I can 
continue to do my important work.  Thank you.
