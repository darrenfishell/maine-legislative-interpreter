Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services,  
We support evidence-based policy and legislative solutions designed to improve public health, so 
we oppose any reduction of access to affordable health coverage for Maine people. This is 
testimony AGAINST LD 902.  
 
As a result of the Medicaid expansion extending health insurance coverage to the people of Maine, 
Maine’s uninsured rate is the 13th lowest in the nation. Access to health care coverage ensures that 
serious diseases can be detected and treated earlier. It also yields better patient outcomes and less 
costs both to the individual and the system. By the end of 2022, expanded MaineCare had resulted 
in 12,693 breast cancer screenings alone. Other impacts were 11,750 Diabetes Treatment, 13,863 
Hypertension, 69,206 Mental Health Treatment, and 17,105 Opioid Disorder Treatment, among 
others.  
 
Research consistently shows that expanding access to Medicaid increases insurance coverage 
rates, increases early-stage diagnoses, and improves access to treatment.  Repealing Medicaid 
expansion will re-open the coverage gap and condemn the victims to being one serious illness 
away from disaster, damage hospitals who treat uninsured patients, and increase costs for everyone 
else in an attempt to balance the losses.  
  
For the above reasons, we urge you to vote “Ought Not To Pass” on LD 902 and preserve public 
health.
