Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
902:
“An
Act
to
Repeal
So-called
MaineCare
Expansion”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
902.
MaineCare
is
a
healthcare
program
designed
for
the
most
vulnerable,
not
for
those
who
are
able
to
work
and
without
dependents.
These
adults
should
be
participating
in
the
labor
force,
and
participating
in
the
private
market
for
health
insurance.
This
is
necessary
not
only
for
those
individuals
to
become
self-sufficient,
but
to
ensure
the
responsible
stewardship
of
tax
dollars.
In
just
the
first
two
years
after
voters
approved
expansion,
MaineCare
spending
increased
by
more
than
11.7%.
In
September
2020,
a
representative
from
the
Maine
Office
of
Fiscal
and
Program
Review
(OFPR)
confirmed
to
the
Legislature’s
Joint
Committee
on
Appropriations
and
Financial
Affairs
that
Medicaid
expansion
had
been
the
largest
cost
driver
within
Medicaid
over
FY20,
rising
by
$280.1
million,
or
9.1%,
from
FY19
to
FY20.
Approximately
$250
million
of
that
increase—or
88.3%—came
from
Medicaid
expansion.

If
the
pre-pandemic
numbers
were
not
alarming,
Mainecare
spending
has
grown
19%
since
2018,
adjusted
for
inflation.
2
Rolls
have
grown
146%
since
January
2020,
including
adding
more
than
57,000
childless,
able-bodied
adults
to
the
program.
Of
the
more
than
106,500
total
enrollees,
this
population
made
90%
of
the
pandemic-era
growth.
3
Today,
Maine
spends
nearly
34%
of
its
budget
on
Mainecare,
which
in
part
pays
for
health
care
services
for
nearly
93,000
able-bodied,
childless
adults
who
have
the
wherewithal
to
support
themselves.
A
Kaiser
Family
Foundation
study
from
2009
showed
a
direct
relationship
between
unemployment
and
Medicaid
case
rates,
finding
that
with
every
1%
increase
in
the
unemployment
rate,
the
Medicaid
caseload
rises
three-quarters
of
a
percent.

There
is
no
substitute
for
a
healthy
economy,
and
while
Maine
should
provide
a
safety
net

those
who
truly
cannot
support
themselves,
providing
benefits
to
able-bodied
adults
without
children
(especially
those
under
50)
has
a
significantly
detrimental
effect
on
labor
force
adaptability.
For
these
reasons,
the
state
should
repeal
Medicaid
expansion.
Please
deem
LD
902
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
prioritize
finite
state
resources
for
Medicaid
for
the
truly
needy,
and
look
out
for
the
welfare
of
individuals
who
can
support
themselves
by
crafting
a
program
which
incentivizes
work
and
independence.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
