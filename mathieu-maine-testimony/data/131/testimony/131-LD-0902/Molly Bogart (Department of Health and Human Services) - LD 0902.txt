Testimony of the Commissioner ’s Office 
Maine Department of Health and Human Services 
In opposition to LD 902, An Act to Repeal S0-called MaineCare Expansion 
May 8, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: I am Molly Bogart, Director of Government Relations 
at the Department of Health and Human Services. I am speaking to our strong opposition to LD 
902, An Act to Repeal MaineCare Expansion. 
Governor Mills’ ﬁrst Executive Order on January 3, 2019 directed the Department of Health and 
Human Services to expeditiously implement Medicaid Expansion under the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act after 59 percent of Maine voters directed the state government to do so. 
Health care coverage has been a top priority for the Mills Administration, and between the 
establishment of the state marketplace, CoverME. gov, and Medicaid Expansion, Governor Mills 
led Maine to have the largest decline in the uninsured rate in the country between 2019 and 2021. 
Currently, over 100,000 Maine residents have MaineCare coverage under the expansion. 
For every dollar that the state invests in care for someone who is enrolled in the expansion group, 
the federal government matches with 9 dollars. In four short years, Medicaid Expansion has 
brought well over $1 billion dollars into Maine, supporting our health care providers and ensuring 
people have access to critical health care. 
Through 2022, expansion has meant: 
- 23,575 of your constituents have received breast or colorectal cancer screenings 
- 25,613 of your constituents have received treatment for diabetes or hypertension 
- 94,306 of your constituents have received treatment for mental health or substance use 
disorder 
At a time of unprecedented workforce challenges, ensuring that Maine people have the resources 
they need to be healthy and work-ready to keep their families stable and secure and keep our 
economy going. Repealing Medicaid expansion is wrong for Maine, and we urge you to vote 
ought not to pass.
