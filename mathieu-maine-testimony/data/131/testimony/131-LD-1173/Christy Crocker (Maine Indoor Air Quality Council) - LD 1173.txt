Maine Indoo r Air Quality Council Testimony  in Support of  
LD 1173 : An Act Directing  the Bureau of General Services to  Ensure Adequate Air Quality in  
All State -Owned and State -Leased Buildings  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council (“MIAQC” or the “Council” ) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization  
dedicated to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable  indoor environments in 
Maine.  Our efforts focus on the development of education , communications, and advocacy for safe and 
healthy indoor environments where Maine citizens live, work, play and learn.  
 
Dear Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on State 
and Local Gov ernment:  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council submits this testimony in support of LD 1173, An Act Directing 
the Bureau of General Services to Ensure Adequate Air Quality in all State -Owned and State -Leased 
Buildings.  
 
Testimony  
 
There is a well -established body of knowledge on the relationship between exposure to indoor 
pollutants and their adverse impact on both the health and productivity of building occupants, as well 
as risk to the building structure itself.  The Council suppo rts all efforts to establish proper management 
of indoor spaces that includes source control, ventilation, moisture management, and use of best 
practices to both investigate and repair buildings to reduce exposure to contaminants.   A copy of our 
policy st atement on Indoor Air Quality is included at the end of this testimony to further explain this 
position.  
 
We understand that the bill sponsor  will be proposing an amendment to LD 1173  that recognizes the 
work the Maine Bureau of General Services is already  doing to manage Maine  state facilities, but 
recommend s some additional strategies to both support and supplement that work.  We support 
Representative Montell’s  propos ed provisions for the reasons  italicized below : 
 
1) Add radon as a specified indoor polluta nt to the IAQ assessment bill passed last session: 
(https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/5/title5sec1742 -G.html ).  Radon is the #1 cause of lung 
cancer in non -smokers, and the #2 cause of lung cancer nationally.  Maine is at particularly high risk 
of radon. The testing data available through the Maine CDC shows that 1/3 of Maine’s buildings 
likely have unacceptable radon levels.   
 
2) Prioritize efforts to assess the Maine State Hou se complex (per #1 above) and improve 
communications and infrastructure to manage both the building structure and the indoor 
environment .  There are many proven environmental management systems that have been 
developed to assist building owners and manager s with creating and maintaining healthy indoor 
spaces for occupants.  U.S. EPA’s “ Tools for Schools ” is just one  example.  All environmental

management systems rely  on the same thing:  an organized body of knowledgeable individuals who 
are tasked with both the responsibility and authority to manage their indoor spaces to reduce 
exposures to pollutants and oversee investigations and repairs when problems occur.  We believe 
there are currently some challenges for all parties involved in the current management of Maine’s 
most public space that could be over come through establishment of more diverse  oversight body 
specific to this complex.  
 
3) Improve communications around existing processes for receiving and responding to occupant 
complaints.  Risk communication is a key component of establishing  trust between b uilding 
occupants and environmental conditions that can impact health.  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council is willing to answer any questions or provide additional 
information to assist you at the work session.

Policy  Statement  on Indoor  Air Quality  
Adopted  by MIAQC  Board  of Directors  on February  6, 2003

Our society has become increasingly aware of the adverse health and economic costs associated with 
poor indoor air quality.   Levels of indoor pollutants (including radon, lead, asbestos, carbon monoxide, 
tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, biologicals, and air toxics and other contaminants) are 
often 2 -5 times higher –and may  be 100 times higher –than outdoor levels. Studies have identified a 
broad range of adverse health effects and symptoms, from headaches, fatigue, nausea, aggravation of 
asthma and allergies, transmission of infectious respiratory diseases, to life threateni ng 
poisonings.   Indoor pollutants are of particular concern because most Americans spend about 90% of 
their time indoors .  
 
The principles for achieving a healthy and productive indoor environment are simple. The goal is an 
environment that is:  
 Clean  
 Dry 
 Pollutant and Pest Free  
 Comfortable  
 

While the methods to achieve these goals may vary, the primary best practice tools are:  
 Prevention or Elimination of Pollutants (source control)  
 Proper Ventilation  
 Thermal and Humidity Control  
 Proper operation and mainte nance of the structure by the building owner  
 Proper use of the structure by the building occupants  
 
Adherence to these basic principles will significantly reduce the risk of adverse health effects from 
indoor pollutants.   Building owners, operators and occ upants should educate themselves on and must 
work together to implement the basic principles and available best practice guidance.
