Public Hearing 
LD 1941, Resolve, To Ensure Access to Critical Orthodontic Care by 
Increasing the MaineCare Reimbursement Rate~ 
Good Afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Rep Meyer and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Bonnie Vaughan RDH, 
IPDH, Med, MBA. l reside in Cumberland and l'm Executive Director of Kennebec 
Valley Dental Center, a nonprofit dental center serving all ages. 
Our services include diagnostic, preventive, restorative, and extractions services. 
Most of our patients are covered by Maine Care insurance. We don't provide 
orthodontic care but we see many children who need teeth straightening. 
Recently we called every orthodontic practice in Maine trying to identify 
Practices where we could refer our MC patients to. 
Attached are ONLY 3 practices that MAY take MC patients. Many practices 
are not taking new MC patients or have long lists. This demonstrates critical 
access we have in dental care. 
Of the two practices we use to refer patients; Dr Glad took MC patients for years 
closed due to retirement. Jesse Albert in Bath, also a nonprofit was an 
orthodontic and restorative center is now limited to 1 day a week for ortho care. 
They are having difficulty recruiting an orthodontic because the low MC rates. 
We appreciate the Committee's time to review this dental care issue. If we can be 
further assistance please let us know.
