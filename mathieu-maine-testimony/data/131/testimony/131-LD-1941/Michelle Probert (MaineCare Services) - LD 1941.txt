Re: LD 1941 – Resolve, to Ensure Access to Critical Orthodontic Care by Increasing the 
MaineCare Reimbursement Rate  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide information in opposition to LD 1941 – Resolve, to Ensure Access to 
Critical Orthodontic Care by Increasing the MaineCare Reimbursement Rate . 
 
This resolve directs the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules in Chapter 
101: MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter II, Section 25, Dental Services and Reimbursement, to 
increase the rate of reimbursement for orthodontic services to $5,000.   
 
The rate reform system established last year in P. L. 2021, ch 639 created a process for ensuring 
rates paid to providers are data -driven, adequate, reasonable, and sustainable. The goal of ch 639 is 
in part to move toward more consistent, equitable rates that create incentives for efficiency and 
high-quality care fo r members. This bill perpetuates a system of rate setting that conflicts with ch 
639 by establishing rate increases that have not been developed through the systematic, 
methodological approach mandated in ch 639, which the Department is already undertaking .  
 
The Department sets rates for orthodontics (except for limited orthodontic treatment) based on 50% 
of the Commercial Median Benchmark, or 100% of the Medicaid State Average Benchmark if the 
Commercial Median Benchmark rate is unavailable or unreliable as defined in Section  5.06(A)(1).  
Dental Services are presently rebased every two years and receive COLA adjustments in the interim 
years; the next COLA is scheduled for July 1, 2023, and the next benchmark adjustments will be 
implemented July 1, 2024.  The Department recently completed a rate study for MaineCare Benefits 
Manual (MBM) Ch. II, Section 25: Dental Services and Reimbursement. Section 25 received 
adjustments in July 2022 as part of P.L. 2021, ch. 398, sec. A -17.  
 
The Department recognizes challe nges related to orthodontic service  access , including but not 
limited to long waitlists for care. These challenges are not addressed in this bill as they are a result 
of workforce shortages and are not limited to MaineCare.  
 
  
 
 Changes proposed in this bill would introduce inconsistency with the methodology described above 
and additional requirements set forth in P.L. 2021, ch 639. Additionally, the proposed rates appear 
to be arbitrary as there is no data presented to support th e amount and they are not derived from 
benchmark rebasing as required in P.L. 2021 ch 639.  
 
Should the bill move forward, the Department would need to conduct MBM Ch. II, Section 25 
rulemaking and implement appropriate operational system changes.  
 
If yo u have any further questions, please feel free to contact us. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert  
Director
