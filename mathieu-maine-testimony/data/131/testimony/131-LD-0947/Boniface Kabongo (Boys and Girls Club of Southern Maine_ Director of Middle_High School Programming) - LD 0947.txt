T o
Whom
It
May
Concern:
My
name
is
Boniface
Kabongo,
and
I
am
the
former
Elementary
Program
Director
and
the 
current
Middle
School
and
High
School
Program
Director
for
the
Portland
Boys
and
Girls
Club. 
I
am
writing
testimony
in
support
of
the
presented
bill.
As
the
summer
approaches,
I
have
been 
thinking
about
the
summer
food
program
for
a
while
now
and
heading
into
my
second
summer 
dealing
with
this
program
I
would
like
to
make
some
improvements
that
would
truly
benefit 
children
all
over
the
state.
In
my
experience,
the
boys
and
girls
club
has
always
been
a
place
with 
open
doors
and
a
place
that
is
a
safe
haven
for
any
child
who
comes
to
the
clubhouse.
The 
children
we
serve
often
come
from
underserved
communities
and
families.
Part
of
why
I
love
my 
job
is
that
we
ensure
they
don’ t
leave
the
place
without
something
to
eat
and
throughout
the 
school
year
that
is
something
that
works
out
smoothly .
The
issue
is
once
we
reach
the
summer , 
the
summer
food
program
that
we
use
sometimes
didn’ t
allow
for
this
to
happen
and
threw
of f 
something
that
our
children
were
used
to
having.
The
issues
I
have
with
the
summer
food
program
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
flexibility
with
time 
to
serve
food
due
to
its
constraints.
The
program
forces
us
to
choose
a
time
slot
to
serve
our 
meals
and
then
we
are
not
allowed
to
serve
the
meals
before
or
after
the
time
slots.
This
causes 
an
issue
because
we
have
children
who
can’ t
always
arrive
at
the
time
that
we
have
to
serve
food 
and
we
have
a
lot
of
children
who
come
to
the
club
hoping
for
meals.
Not
everyone
can
arrive
at 
the
same
time
for
meals.
Another
issue
is
having
to
estimate
how
much
food
we
need
to
order
or
have.
As
the
clubhouse 
is
an
open
to
all
kids,
we
have
a
fluctuation
of
how
many
kids
attend
the
clubhouse
everyday .
In 
my
belief
and
experience
it
is
always
better
to
have
more
than
less.
Sometimes
the
kids
come 
back
for
seconds
and
even
thirds
if
they
like
the
food
or
are
hungry
enough.
At
the
end
of
the
day 
we
can
always
let
them
take
some
home
or
save
it
for
the
next
day .
This
is
an
important
issue
and 
I
believe
we
need
to
have
the
flexibility
to
order
as
much
food
as
we
need
or
can
to
serve
our 
kids.
I
hope
the
state
can
work
in
conjunction
with
the
federal
government
to
provide
us
with
the 
flexibility
to
utilize
the
food
that
we
order
through
the
food
summer
program.
