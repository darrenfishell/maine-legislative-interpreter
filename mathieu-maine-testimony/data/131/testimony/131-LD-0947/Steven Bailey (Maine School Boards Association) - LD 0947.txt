TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 947 
AN ACT TO SUPPORT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FREE SUMMER LUNCHES FOR CHILDREN AND 
TO CREATE A PROGRAM TO DISTRIBUTE LEFTOVER SCHOOL FOOD WITHIN COMMUNITIES 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 947. 
Our associations support this bill as it allows students to take left-over food home and provides opportunities 
for schools to reduce waste. It also allows schools to work with food banks to package and distribute food. 
We applaud the efforts to make sure all our families have the food they need and that school food does not go 
to waste when there are people who need it in our communities. 
Our concem is the bill calls for the Department of Education to create a program for the distribution of surplus 
food. We don’t know if they have the p6I‘SOI1I16l or capacity to take on this responsibility.
