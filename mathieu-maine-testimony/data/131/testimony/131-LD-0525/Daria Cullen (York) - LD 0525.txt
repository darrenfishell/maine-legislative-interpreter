I’m writing in support of this bill because I believe farmworkers should have a right 
to unionize for fair wages, reasonable schedules, humane housing accommodations, 
and reduced threat of employer intimidation. Many other states have already enacted 
this law and it’s been a benefit not just to farmworkers, but also to the employers and 
the state because farmworkers have agency and feel vested and safe in their work 
environment. It’s a win for all. I hope the committee will vote ought to pass. Thank 
you.
