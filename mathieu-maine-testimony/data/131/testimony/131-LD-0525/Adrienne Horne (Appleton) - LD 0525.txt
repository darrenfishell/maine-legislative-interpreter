LD 525
Testimony in Support of LD 525 “An Act to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing 
Them to Organize for the Purposes of Collective Bargaining”
April 16, 2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing,
My name is Adrienne Horne, I am a resident of Appleton, and I am writing to you to 
share my support for LD 525 and the effort to allow farmworkers to organize and join
a union.
I support this bill because I believe all workers should have the right to organize and 
join a union to protect their rights in the workplace. The fact that farm workers 
currently don’t have this right is unfair. When some members of our community are 
fearful about their work conditions and their ability to speak up about it, it impacts the
entire community. I want to see Maine be a place where all workers can enjoy legal 
protection to organize and so be a part of a healthy and energetic workplace that is 
integrated into the broader community. Many states, including Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, and New York already allow for collective bargaining for farm workers. As a 
rural Maine resident who benefits from local food, I wish to see Maine become a 
leader in better farm labor practices. We cannot have this vibrant part of our economy
without ensuring the vibrancy of the people behind the food.
Thank you for considering my testimony and for all the work you do. I hope you join 
me in support of LD 398.
Sincerely,
Adrienne Horne
