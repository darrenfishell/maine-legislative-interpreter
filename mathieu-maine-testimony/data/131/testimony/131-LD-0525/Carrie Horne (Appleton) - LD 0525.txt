Testimony in Support of LD 525 “An Act to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing 
Them to Organize for the Purposes of Collective Bargaining”
April 17, 2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing,
I am writing today in support of LD 525: “An Act to Protect Farm Workers by 
Allowing Them to Organize for the Purposes of Collective Bargaining”. 
I was surprised to learn that agriculture workers have less protections and rights than 
workers in other industries in Maine to negotiate their contract with their employers. 
This seems unfair and inequitable to me. The rights to organize a worker’s union and 
participate in collective bargaining are not protected for farm workers as they are for 
other workers, and therefore are very dangerous for them to pursue. If farmworkers 
could have the right to organize and join a union, they would be able to negotiate with
their employers to make their jobs safer and more equitable. With protections from 
employer intimidation and fear of retaliation, farm workers could advocate for fair 
wages, reasonable schedules, safe working conditions, and humane housing 
accommodations. Without explicit protection from the state, farm workers can be 
fired for advocating for better conditions and fair labor practices. Giving workers the 
opportunity to organize leads to a healthier, happier, more productive workforce.
This bill will ultimately help all workers, agricultural businesses, groceries and 
consumers in Maine by providing fair, safe and equitable employment for our Maine 
farm workers.
Sincerely,
Carrie Horne
Resident of Appleton Maine
