LD 525
In 1961, Martin Luther King Jr spoke to the strength of the labor movement and how 
the creation of unions not only helps workers but also helps the country as a whole: 
“The labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it. By 
raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for 
industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.” 
Maine farmworkers deserve the right to unionize. Our country is built on principles of
freedom of speech and equality. Passing LD 525 and allowing farmworkers to 
collectively bargain and voice their needs not only would improve the legal 
protections and livelihoods of farmers, but also would patriotically, socially, and 
economically strengthen our entire state.
