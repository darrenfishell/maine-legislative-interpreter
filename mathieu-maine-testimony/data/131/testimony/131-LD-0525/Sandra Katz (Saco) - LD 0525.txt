LD 525
I am writing in support of LD#525 to support farmworkers' right to organize. I believe
all workers should have the right to organize. Workers should be able to work 
together to improve their conditions and to have someone represent them to their 
employers. I know agricultural work is very difficult with long hours and these people
need support.
Thank you for your time.
