LD 525
I am an organic wild blueberry farmer, certified by MOFGA since 1996, with a 
seasonal full-time crew of 12-16 people that harvest and process 25,000-35,000 lbs. of
fresh-pack and frozen berries. My wife and I own and lease seven wild blueberry 
fields across five towns in the Blue Hill area, and sell much of our crop 
direct-to-consumer from our farm, with the balance being sold to Merrillâ€™s freezer in 
Hancock. We are also now constructing a new wild blueberry processing/freezing 
facility in North Penobscot, where we will be expanding our business to process and 
market berries from other organic growers across the state, adding more year-round 
employment opportunities in our community.  We support LD 525, as we would like 
to see farmworkers have the same rights to organize as other non-ag workers do, and 
make steps towards the end of exploitive labor practices that cheapen food and 
devalue farm work.  We see this bill as one way the state of Maine can encourage a 
welcoming atmosphere for its labor pool needs, and create a framework that holds 
farm work as highly skilled and highly valued labor.  We support efforts to create a 
level playing field where agricultural employment is held and seen in the same legal, 
social, cultural and economic standards as all other employment opportunities in our 
state.  Thank you.
