Arthur Phillips, Maine Center for Economic Policy 
April 18, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee 
on Labor and Housing, my name is Arthur Phillips, and I am an analyst at the Maine Center 
for Economic Policy. I am here to testify in support of these three bills which would extend 
basic labor rights to farm workers and help make our agricultural system more resilient. 
Our state recognizes workers’ rights to fair wages and to bargain collectively, but farm 
workers have long been excluded from these basic economic freedoms. Workers in Maine's 
agriculture industry — which employs a disproportionately large share of Black, Latino, 
Indigenous, and Asian American Mainers — have been subject to exemptions from basic 
labor laws that leave them more likely to live in poverty and that make racial inequities 
worse. 
While these exemptions have been enshrined in federal law for nearly 90 years, more than 
a dozen states have taken it upon themselves to right this injustice. Our state has the 
opportunity and moral responsibility to do that too, by ensuring farmworkers have the 
right to a minimum wage, overtime, and the freedom collectively bargain with their 
employers. 
Currently, farmworkers are much more likely to live in poverty than other Mainers: about 
one-quarter of Maine farmhands live in poverty, making them roughly 4.5 times as likely to 
live below the poverty line as other Maine workers. ‘ Nationally, farmworkers ’ wages are 
roughly 60 percent of what all other nonsupen/isory workers are paid. 
The USDA's last Census of Agriculture found that Maine had 2,230 farms with hired labor, 
paying a total of $134 million in wages. Overall, farms employing at least five workers 
accounted for 77.3 percent of farmworkers. “ 335 farms hired 10 or more workers, 
employing nearly 60 percent of all farmworkers in the state. And as of 2021, Maine had 140 
farms with sales of more than $1 million, with an average acreage of 2,071 .“' 
So, while we 
know that many of Maine's farm establishments are small, most farmworkers are 
employed by larger enterprises that can manage to offer the most basic labor rights to 
which nearly all other employers are held accountable.

facts do not mean farmworkers should be deprived of basic rights that we take for granted 
for all other forms of work. Ensuring workers have the right to collectively bargain and 
overtime pay is long overdue and will help Maine's agricultural industry thrive in the years 
ahead. We urge you to support the bills under discussion today.
