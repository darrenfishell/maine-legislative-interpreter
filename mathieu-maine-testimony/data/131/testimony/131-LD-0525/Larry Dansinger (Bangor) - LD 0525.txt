LD 525
April 15, 2023
To members of the Labor and Housing Committee of the Maine Legislature:
I am writing to encourage the Committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on both LD 398 and
LD 525.  These address the wages of farm workers and the ability for agricultural 
workers to organize a labor union and bargain collectively with their employers.
These bills are not asking for special treatment at all. They are simply asking that 
individuals employed in agriculture be treated the same as other workers in 
construction, retail, government, industrial, etc. and whether their collars are blue, 
pink, or some other color. 
I’m sure others will also point out this historical and current “special treatment” of 
agricultural workers. That agriculture and domestic employment were dominated by 
Blacks and other people of color, and that state and federal lawmakers in the 1930’s 
intentionally chose to leave them out of coverage for both overtime work and the 
ability to organize a labor union, was an act of racism. A continuation, now and 
tomorrow, of that denial of basic rights is a continuation of that original act. Let us 
not allow a policy that began as racism to continue any longer, whether we think it is 
still racism or not.
While some of those who work in agricultural jobs may work temporarily or 
part-time, others work full-time, five days a week or even every day. Cows and 
chickens do not take off weekends and holidays from giving milk or laying eggs. 
Agricultural work is different but not unique. It does not deserve to be singled out for 
the restrictions that have been placed on it in the past.
Let us end this denial of basic rights to certain individuals just because of the kind of 
work they do and hold all workers and employers to the same standard in their rights 
and responsibilities.
