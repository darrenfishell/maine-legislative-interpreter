 Testimony of Maine AFL-CIO Legislative & Political Director, Adam Goode, in Support of 525 “An Act 
to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing Them to Organize for the Purposes of Collective Bargaining” 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of Labor & Housing Committee, my name is Adam 
Goode. I’m the Legislative and Political Director of the Maine AFL-CIO. We represent 40,000 working people 
in the state of Maine. We work to improve the lives and working conditions of our members and all working 
people. We testify in support of LD 525.  
 
Working people, whether black, brown or white, should be able to organize together to improve their working 
conditions and lives. Talking to co-workers and joining together in collective action has been the pathway to 
dignity and respect for working people throughout the world. Joining a union is the most effective way to 
achieve pay equity, job security, fair scheduling, better vacation time, protections from favoritism and more. 
This is a right we in the labor movement cherish along with labor laws like the minimum wage, overtime, 
workplace safety standards, workers compensation and unemployment. 
 
That is why we support LD 525 and any effort to give farmworkers the right to organize and join a union to 
negotiate fair wages, reasonable schedules, safe working conditions, humane housing accommodations and 
protections against employer intimidation as well as to enforce prohibited acts of agricultural employers and 
labor organizations.  
 
We are well aware that you will hear from farmers and farm owners that have concerns about this concept. We 
recognize that farming is incredibly difficult work, that the economics of farming, especially family farming, 
are very challenging and that farmers work incredibly hard in Maine to scratch out an existence. That is all true 
and it is also true that workers should have a fundamental first amendment right to freedom of association and 
freedom of assembly. The right of workers to organize is a fundamental human right that all workers deserve. 
Those rights should not cease to exist simply because you walk into the doors or fields of your workplace.  
 
It is important that we understand the historical reasons that agricultural workers were carved out of much of 
labor law protections, including the right to organize and collectively bargain. The reason for the inequity in 
protections between working people in the agriculture sector and working people in other sectors is rooted in a 
history in Maine and America of categorically excluding certain groups from basic labor rights and laws.

6https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/farmworkers-are-dying-in-extreme-heat-few-standards-exist-to-protect-them In the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced several 
reforms to put people back to work, encourage unionization1 and provide economic security for working people. 
New Deal policies like Social Security, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act 
transformed the lives of millions of Americans.  
 
Certain members of Congress demanded the exclusion of farmworkers and domestic laborers — many of whom 
were African Americans in the South — from receiving the benefits of these policies. In 1935, racially 
discriminatory laws prevailed in much of the United States. In drafting the NLRA, Congress deferred to such 
laws by excluding two categories of predominately non-white workers -- "agricultural laborers" and 
"domestics" -- from labor protections. This was done in large part to gain the Southern votes of “Dixiecrats” 
needed for passage of the NLRA.2 Although race neutral language was used to make these exceptions, hundreds 
of thousands of Black workers were excluded from basic labor protections like the minimum wage, overtime 
and collective bargaining rights.  
 
It is difficult to deeply and genuinely grapple with our history. I want to be very clear. To raise the history of 
these exclusions is not in any way a comment on any current individual’s behavior or the critical work that 
farmers do in Maine. But this history lives with us today - it remains an important aspect of labor law that is 
connected to systemic racism and access to workplace protections. It is our shared collective inheritance. And, 
together, we have a collective responsibility to right past wrongs and to keep building a more perfect union for 
all of us.  
 
The impact of these exclusions, which were a part of the New Deal Era political system and served as a race-
neutral proxy for excluding workers of color from statutory benefits and protections that most whites had, is felt 
today in Maine. State law does not allow farmworkers to form a union or engage in collective bargaining. We 
think there should be changes in Maine laws that make it so that farmworkers can organize to improve their 
working conditions if they so choose.  
 
The National Labor Relations Act does allow states to grant collective bargaining rights to workers not covered 
by the NLRA, such as agricultural workers. California has a California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, 
established in 1975, that allows agricultural workers to organize and establishes collective bargaining processes 
and procedures for agricultural workers. Fourteen states currently guarantee collective bargaining rights for 
farmworkers.3 
 
When we think about our shared history, it is worth asking ourselves are we not a better country because Cesar 
Chavez and the farmworkers demanded rights, won rights, exercised those rights and gained a modicum more 
dignity and protection on the job. Would we be a better country if Cesar Chavez and farmworkers did not have 
the right to organize? We think not. The same arguments were made against those workers in California having 
the right to organize. We are a better country and society because they exercised their right to organize, and 
thirteen states have followed suit. Maine will be a better state if agricultural workers have the same rights. 
 
Many paid farmworkers in Maine are migrant workers. They work in agricultural fields related to blueberries, 
seafood, trees, poultry, dairy, wreaths and eggs. The nature of these work arrangements is full of power 
imbalances related to immigration status, language barriers and economic vulnerability. Exposure to pesticides, 
poor housing, isolation and loneliness are a normal part of the routine for migrant workers in Maine.

 Agriculture also ranks among the most dan gerous sectors in the economy4 with one of the highest fatal injury 
rates. Agricultural workers are vulnerable to sexual abuse5, extreme heat waves6, toxic pesticides and accidents 
with heavy machinery. Whether it's raking blueberries or working in the seafood, poultry, dairy or egg 
industries, power imbalances related to immigration status and language barriers are a regular part of the lives 
of agricultural workers in Maine.  
 
The first time this bill was heard, we cited then recent news of eight migrant workers who make wreaths in 
Maine being fired after reporting sexual harassment to their employers.7 The last time this bill had a hearing, a 
Maine tomato grower had just paid $245,000 in back wages to migrant workers after violating federal labor 
laws.8 Collective bargaining rights protect workers throughout the economy. The exclusion of agricultural 
workers makes one group of employees more vulnerable to loss of wages and harassment on the job.  
 
It is not easy to form a union. Having the right should be a basic rule of the workplace. It simply means that 
workers can exercise their freedom of association to band together to bargain with their employer for basic 
dignity on the job. A person should be able to do that without fear of reprisal. 
 
We represent 40,000 working people who have union jobs in Maine. For working class people, these jobs 
provide a sense of meaning as well as security, fairness and respect. We know that working class people who 
own farms and who work at farms have differing perspectives on this policy. We stand with you today to say 
that the same laws that allow working people in other sectors of Maine’s economy to negotiate collectively to 
improve working conditions should apply to agricultural workers.  
 
We ask that you support LD 525.
