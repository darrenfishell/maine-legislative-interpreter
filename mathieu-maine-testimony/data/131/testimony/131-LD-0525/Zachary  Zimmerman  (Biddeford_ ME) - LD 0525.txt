Zachary  Zimmerman 
Biddeford, ME
LD 525
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing:
My name is Zachary Zimmerman, I am a resident of Biddeford, testifying in support 
of LD 525. 
I support this bill becoming law because personally, I would love to join a union for 
added protection and bargaining rights if that were an option in Maine. I think 
everyone should have the right to join a union, if they so choose! This right should 
apply to those that work for small family farms and those that work on larger scale 
farms- a worker's labor is valuable no matter the scale at which its applied. 
As a resident of Biddeford, I hope that committee member Marc Malon takes my 
testimony into account and does everything he can as my representative to get this bill
to the Governor's desk. At which point, I hope that Governor Mills does the right 
thing for Maine's farm workers and makes up for the mistake she made in vetoing LD 
151. 
For these reasons, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 525.
