LD 525
LD 525, regarding the protection of farm workers by allowing them to organize for 
the purposes of collective bargaining, would be a great bill if all food originated in 
your local grocery store and agricultural workers in Maine were systemically 
mistreated.  Harvest time for anything grown anywhere is critical.  If crops are not 
harvested because a union has decided it is the perfect time to strike for higher wages,
it is not only the farmer who loses. Talk about food waste! We offer above minimum 
wage to find and keep employees.  We do not mistreat them.  They are too hard to 
replace. Current laws were written to exclude agricultural employees from some 
overtime rules and from collective bargaining for good reason.  LD 525 has created a 
problem out of thin air, as far as we are concerned, and has many negative 
consequences.  Please do not advance this bill.
