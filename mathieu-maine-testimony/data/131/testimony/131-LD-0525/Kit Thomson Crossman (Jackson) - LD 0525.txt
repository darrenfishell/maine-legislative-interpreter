I strongly support the passage of LD 525. One of the fundamental pillars of our democracy is the 
ability to meet and organize in order to better our living and working conditions. The questions we 
must ask are: Why aren’t our agricultural workers allowed to do so without fear of repercussion? Why 
don’t farm workers have the same protections as other workers? And, equally important, what are the 
outcomes for this lack of fundamental freedom? 
 
Approximately 25% of farm workers IN MAINE live in poverty. This is nearly 4.5 times greater than 
the rest of Maine’s workforce1. Nationally, farm workers earned $14.62 per hour in 2020, just 60 
percent of what non-farm production and non-supervisory workers earned. Over 70% of investigations  
of farms conducted by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor detect 
violations—things like wage theft and inadequate housing, as well as other violations of laws designed 
to protect farm workers.2 Why do we let this continue? 
 
At least 18 states have passed legislation that allows farm workers to organize for collective bargaining. 
Now is the time to bring Maine into the 21st century. Now is the time to improve the working and 
living conditions of farm workers. Now is the time to treat farm workers with dignity and respect – the 
dignity and respect afforded other workers here in Maine. You are the people we have elected to 
represent ALL the people of Maine. I unequivocally and emphatically urge you to vote in support of 
this bill.
