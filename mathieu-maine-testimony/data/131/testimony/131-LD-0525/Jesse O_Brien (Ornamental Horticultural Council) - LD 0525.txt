Ornamental Horticultural Council 
Jesse O’Brien, Spokesperson 
Opposed to LD 525 
“An Act to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing Them to Organize for Purposes of 
Collective Bargaining” 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the joint committee of 
Labor and Housing, my name is Jesse O’Brien and I am speaking on behalf of the 
Ornamental Horticulture Council, OHC. We are a large diverse industry with 
thousands employed in our businesses throughout the State. We care deeply for 
the environment and our employees. Though some of our businesses have many 
employees much of the industry are small family like businesses whose owners 
work side by side with those that they employ. The owners appreciate and care 
for those employees. 
In all walks of life there are business that are outliers. There are statues in place 
to deal with such outliers. Finally, since a similar bill last session was Vetoed by 
Governor Mills, we feel that this bill, LD 525 Ought not to Pass. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Jesse O’Brien, Spokesperson 
Ornamental Horticulture Council
