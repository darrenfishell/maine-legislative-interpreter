LD 525 An Act to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing Them to Organize for

 Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
April 18, 2023 
  
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Labor and Housing Committee, 
 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. The MEA is the union that 
represents nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well 
as in our institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine 
Community College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired 
educators. 
 
I am testifying in support of LD 525 An Act to Protect Farm Workers by Allowing Them to Organize 
for the Purposes of Collective Bargaining. 
 
Two of MEA’s Core Values are A Just Society and Collective Action. As a union, the MEA fully 
understands the importance of the role of collective bargaining in ensuring that employees are treated 
fairly, have safe working conditions, and that their rights are protected. Collective action through 
collective bargaining is key to having a just society for all. 
 
Yet those who work in the agricultural sector are currently denied the opportunity to organize in our 
state. These are the people who provide us all with the most essential of our basic needs—they quite 
literally put food on our tables. Despite the critical role they play, many farm workers are exploited, 
experiencing high rates of poverty, food insecurity, and hazardous working conditions1. Those who 
speak up about unsafe conditions are likely to experience retaliation for doing so. And in spite of at 
times working 12-hour shifts, agricultural workers are exempted from minimum wage and overtime pay 
laws.2 Given the demographics3 of the workers in this industry, the issue of racial inequities evidently 
plays a large part in these situations. 
 
As of July 2022, twelve states allow collective bargaining for agricultural workers4, with more states 
considering legislation to do so. It is our hope that Maine does the right thing for these most essential 
workers. We urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 525. It is time to address the injustices and inequities 
that have continued for far too long.
