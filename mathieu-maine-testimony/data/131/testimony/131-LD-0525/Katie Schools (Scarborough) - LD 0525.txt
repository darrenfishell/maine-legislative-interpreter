Good
Afternoon,
Representatives.
My
name
is
Katie
Schools
and
I
live
in
Scarborough,
Maine.
I
am
currently
an
undergraduate
student
at
University
of
Southern
Maine.
When
I
was
15,
I
got
my
first
job
on
a
family
farm
and
went
on
to
work
there
for
the
next
five
summers.
I
was
good
friends
with
the
owner’s
daughter,
and
most
of
my
friends
worked
on
the
farm
with
me.
I
became
intimately
familiar
with
what
it
means
to
be
a
working-class
farmer,
long
days,
no
breaks,
backbreaking
labor,
and
work
in
any
conditions,
rain,
shine,
thunderstorm,
anything.
These
experiences
shaped
who
I
am
today
and
taught
me
the
value
of
a
strong
work
ethic,
the
beauty
of
rural
life,
and
the
beauty
of
our
state.
However,
as
the
years
went
on
and
as
I
grew
older,
I
became
increasingly
aware
of
the
fact
that
my
job
on
the
farm
did
not
have
the
same
protections
others
did
in
jobs
outside
of
the
agricultural
sector.
I
didn’t
make
the
minimum
wage,
we
didn’t
have
overtime
protections,
and
so
on.
I
also
increasingly
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
I
held
significantly
more
privilege
than
the
migrant
workers
I
had
been
working
beside
for
five
years.
My
friends
and
I
left
the
farm
mid-afternoon,
but
the
migrant
workers
worked
until
sunset.
I
could
go
home
at
night
and
leave
at
a
reasonable
time,
and
these
workers
lived
on
the
farm.
I
have
spent
the
past
year
working
on
a
research
project
at
the
University
of
Southern
Maine
on
food
service
workers.
In
my
research,
one
fact
is
repeated
over
and
over
again:
workers
in
our
food
chain
were,
and
continue
to
be,
excluded
from
labor
protections
for
racial
reasons.
In
1938,
the
Fair
Standards
Labor
Act
instituted
federal
protections
that
created
many
of
the
standards
we
know
for
work
today,
such
as
the
minimum
wage,
overtime
protections,
and
child
labor
protections
.
However,
the
revolutionary
moment
in
America’s
history
for
white
workers
excluded
black
workers
from
protection
1
.
Post-Emancipation,
formerly
enslaved
Black
workers
took
jobs
in
specific
industries,
disproportionately
in
agricultural,
domestic,
and
service
work
2
.
Most
jobs
in
these
industries
were
sharecroppers,
tenant
farmers,
domestic
servants,
railroad
porters,
barbers,
or
as
servers
in
restaurants
3
.
These
sectors
were
intentionally
excluded
from
wage
and
hour
laws
and
collective
bargaining
rights
to
uphold
white
supremacy
and
the
exploitation
of
Black
labor.
While
white
workers
were
brought
into
a
new
era
of
economic
security,
Black
workers
were
excluded.
Today,
the
legacy
of
exclusion
lives
on.
Farmworkers
today
are
dispropritionately
migrant
workers,
making
up
almost
70%
of
the
agricultural
workforce
4
.
Agricultural
work
is
one
of
the
lowest
paid
industries,
suffer
the
most
dangerous
conditions,
and
are
extremely
vulnerable
due
to
the
lack
of
legal
protections
and
immigration
status
5
.
We
can
no
longer
turn
a
blind
eye
towards
these
injustices.
It
is
time
for
the
state
of
Maine
to
make
value
and
protect
a l l
workers.
For
these
reasons,
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD
525.
