LD 398
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing: 
My name is Lorelei Cimeno. I am a resident and farmer in Orland, Maine. I am 
testifying in opposition to LD 398.  
We have a great relationship with our employee, Orane. He has an H2A visa. The 
H2A program is a federal, and highly regulated program. The minimum wage for an 
H2A worker is $16.99. Last year, it was $15.66, so it has been increasing every year. 
There are many costs involved with employing an H2A worker. We provide housing 
that meets certain standards, transportation, visa costs, lawyer fees, etc. 
Orane comes to the US to make as much money in five months as he can. His entire 
family back in Jamaica depends on it. There are very few jobs in Jamaica. Orane was 
a bartender in Jamaica before he worked for us. He told us that the minimum wage for
a bartender in Jamaica is $40 American dollars per week. Orane is only allowed to 
work for our farm while he is here with his H2A visa. He wants to work as much as 
possible. When he started, we encouraged him to take at least a day off. Eventually, 
he asked if he could work every day. If LD 398 were to pass, it would hurt Orane. We
would hire another employee, and Orane would have to split his hours with them. He 
would no longer work more than 40 hours per week, and he would have to support his
family with less money. And itâ€™s not like he can get a job that pays him even close to 
a living wage in Jamaica.
Please consider how this bill will affect H2A workers. 
Thank you,
Lorelei Cimeno
