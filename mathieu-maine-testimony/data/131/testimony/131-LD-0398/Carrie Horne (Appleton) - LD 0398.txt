Testimony in Support of LD 398 “An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Other 
Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws”
April 17, 2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing,
I am writing today in support of LD 398: “An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and 
Other Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws”. 
I have been surprised to find that farmworkers in our state are compensated 
differently than other workers for the hard work that they are required to do. One way 
we can amend this inequity of compensation is to update our laws to require that farm
workers are given overtime pay, and paid a fair wage. 25% of farmworkers in Maine 
live in poverty, which is 4.5x more than other Maine workers. I support LD 398 
because I want to know that agricultural workers around the state are given the same 
rights as other workers in the state by having the right to a living wage and overtime 
pay. 
When we provide a way for the 13,440 hired farm workers in Maine to have access to
fair pay, this will be positive for the entire state. Since measures like this have been 
taken in other states including California, Colorado, Hawaii, Minnesota, Maryland, 
New York, Oregon, and Washington, overtime pay has not represented a financial 
strain for farmers, and doesn’t increase retail prices considerably either. This bill will 
ultimately help all workers, agricultural businesses, groceries and consumers in Maine
by providing fair, safe and equitable employment for our Maine farm workers.
Sincerely,
Carrie Horne
Resident of Appleton Maine
