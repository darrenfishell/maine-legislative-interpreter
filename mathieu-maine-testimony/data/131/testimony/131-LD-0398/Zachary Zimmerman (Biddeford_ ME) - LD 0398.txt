Zachary Zimmerman
Biddeford, ME
LD 398
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing:
My name is Zachary Zimmerman, I am a resident of Biddeford, testifying in support 
of LD 398.
I believe LD 398 should become law because I, as a farm laborer myself, have had 
my quality of life greatly increase in the past 5 years as a result of better wages, 
annually, working on a small farm in Scarborough. I don't understand why other 
farmworkers in Maine shouldn't be afforded this same privilege. I believe all workers 
in Maine (and abroad) should be paid fairly for the labor they contribute in the pursuit
of profit for their employers. In the instances where farm employees work overtime, 
they should be paid for said overtime. I don't think a farm worker's labor is different 
from the labor of workers in other sectors that are afforded these same protections. 
As a resident of Biddeford, I hope that committee member Marc Malon takes my 
testimony into account and does everything he can as my representative to get this bill
to the Governor's desk.
For these reasons, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 398.
