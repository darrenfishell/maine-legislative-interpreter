Dear
Senator
T ipping,
Representative
Roeder ,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing:
My
name
is
Kelsey
Herrington.
I
am
a
resident
of
Biddeford
and
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD
398
and
LD
525.
I
am
a
full-time
farmer
and
farm
employer .
I
co-own
and
operate
T wo
Farmers
Farm
in
Scarborough,
which
grows
produce
for
local
and
regional
wholesale
markets
and
is
the
sole
source
of
income
for
my
family .
I
started
working
on
farms
because
I
wanted
a
career
in
food
production
but
I
didn’ t
want
to
be
a
business
owner .
However ,
the
poor
compensation,
and
unsafe
and
undignified
working
conditions
I
experienced
directly ,
and
observed
on
other
farms,
led
me
to
conclude
that
working
for
myself
was
the
only
way
to
make
a
dignified
living
through
farming.
I
share
my
experience
not
to
advocate
for
small
business
ownership
as
a
solution
to
labor
exploitation,
because
it
is
not,
but
to
demonstrate
how
commonplace
the
dehumanizing
conditions
of
farm
work
are
-
they
impact
all
types
of
workers
on
all
types
of
farms.
I
also
recognize
that
the
challenging
conditions
I
experienced
pale
in
comparison
to
the
brutality
faced
by
many
farmworkers
who
are
systematically
deprived
of
the
privileges
I
have
as
a
white,
middle-class,
US
citizen.
What
I
keep
hearing
in
agricultural
industry
spaces
is
that
“everyone
deserves
to
be
treated
fairly ,
but…”,where
“but”
is
followed
by
a
variety
of
excuses
that
attempt
to
justify
the
dehumanizing
conditions
current
Maine
labor
laws
allow
farm
owners
to
subject
farmworkers
to.
These
excuses
often
claim
that
“family
farms”or
“farm
communities”
will
suf fer
if
all
farm
workers
are
given
the
basic
rights
and
protections
these
bills
provide.
But
farms
and
farm
communities
are
built
through
the
labor
of
farm
workers.
Farmworkers
literally
create
the
value
that
allows
farms
to
sustain
themselves
and
expand,
yet
25%
of
Maine
farmworkers
live
in
poverty .
In
spite
of
their
hard
work,
long
hours,
and
personal
sacrifices
in
the
face
of
such
adversity ,
Maine
farmworkers
are
not
legally
protected
to
advocate
for
themselves
by
or ganizing.
Every
worker ,
including
every
farmworker ,
deserves
to
be
treated
with
dignity ,
to
be
compensated
well,
and
have
the
right
to
or ganize.
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
Ought
to
Pass
on
LD
398
and
LD
525.
Thank
you
Kelsey
Herrington
