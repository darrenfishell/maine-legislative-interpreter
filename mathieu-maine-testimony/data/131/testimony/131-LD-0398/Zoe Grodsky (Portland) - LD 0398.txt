LD 398
I am writing in support of L.D. 398, An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Other 
Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws. 
It is essential that the state of Maine take a stand to protect agricultural workers, many
of whom are migrant workers, with the same protections as almost all other 
employees in the state of Maine by protecting them with wage and hour laws. 
I am writing as someone who works in the food system, working to provide access to 
nutritious and culturally appropriate food for families in Maine. I know that treating 
agricultural workers justly, which includes compensating workers fairly for their work
and providing overtime protection, is an equally necessary component of creating a 
more just, sustainable, equitable food and economic system in Maine and beyond. 
Sincerely,
Zoe Grodsky
