I am speaking in support of L.D. 398, An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and 
Other Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws. 
I am speaking as an individual who has experience working on small farms, working 
with farmers, and providing services for migrant workers in Maine.  I support 
agricultural workers being protected, without exception, by wage and hour laws like 
almost every other employee in the state of Maine. 
When looking at who is exempted under the current employee protections under 26 
MRSA ยง603 subsection 3, the history of white supremacy is glaringly obvious. 
Agricultural workers, alongside employees of the fishing industry, taxi drivers, 
prisoners, and homeworkers, are among those EXEMPT from standard labor 
protections. The people employed in these industries are disproportionately people of 
color and/or impoverished in the state of Maine and in states across the country. 
White people in power lobbied for these exemptions in order to exploit poor people, 
especially people of color. 
Eight other states have enacted overtime protection for farmworkers. If the state of 
California can protect 377,593 farm workers under these laws, Maine can protect its 
13,440 farm workers, including 2,191 migrant workers (Maine numbers from 2017 
Ag census).  
I understand that it is challenging to thrive as either an employer or employee in the 
farming business. At the same time, there should be no exceptions to protecting and 
fairly compensating farm employees for their work.  
Sincerely,
