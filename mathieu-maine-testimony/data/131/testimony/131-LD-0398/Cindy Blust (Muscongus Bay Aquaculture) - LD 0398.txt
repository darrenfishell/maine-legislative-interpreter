I have been working at an oyster farm for the past 15 years. It is time for farm 
workers to get paid overtime. We are expected to put in very long hours at a job that 
is physically and mentally demanding and we are currently only making our hourly 
wage for all the hours. Farms should not be able to get away with that. In this 
industry, the employers are not hiring enough people to get the job done. Instead, the 
workers are expected to put in all the extra hours to get the job done. I believe that if 
overtime pay was mandatory, the workers would not be abused and, in turn, would 
not burn out. The employers would be forced to hire more employees or fairly 
compensate us workers that are putting our heart and soul into the business. Please 
pass this bill.
