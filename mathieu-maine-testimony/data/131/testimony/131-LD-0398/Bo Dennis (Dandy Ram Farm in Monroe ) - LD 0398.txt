Senator
T ipping,
Representative
Roeder ,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing:
My
name
is
Bo
Dennis.
I
am
one
of
the
farmers
at
Dandy
Ram
Farm
of
Monroe
and
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD
398
and
LD
525.
I
believe
LD
398
and
LD
525
should
become
law
because
farm
workers
rights
are
human
rights
and
we
all
deserve
to
be
paid
a
living
wage.
The
roots
of
the
agriculture
worker
exemption
from
the
right
to
or ganize
and
be
legal
employees
being
paid
the
state
minimum
wage
have
roots
in
enslavement
systems
and
it
is
time
this
ends.
I
was
a
farmworker
for
8
years
in
Maine
before
starting
my
own
business
in
Monroe.
I
was
paid
between
$8/hour
to
$12/
hour ,
unable
to
pay
my
bills,
and
all
of
this
was
seen
as
ok
by
the
current
legal
standards.
My
body's
labor
was
being
exploited
by
farm
managers
and
when
I
asked
for
raises
I
was
told
that
it
would
hurt
their
business.
I
would
then
have
to
leave
that
job,
leaving
that
farm
business
with
insecure
labor
to
accomplish
their
business
needs.
I
now
have
a
diversified
flower ,
herb,
and
seed
farm
with
4
workers.
W e
have
integrated
a
wage
of
$17-20/
an
hour
for
our
employees
into
our
operating
budget
as
a
business.
W e
believe
with
business
planning
assistance
this
is
possible
across
farms
in
the
state.
Farms
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
as
other
businesses
and
workers
deserve
rights
codified
into
law .
For
all
these
reasons,
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
Ought
to
Pass
on
LD
398
and
LD
525.
Thank
you,
Bo
