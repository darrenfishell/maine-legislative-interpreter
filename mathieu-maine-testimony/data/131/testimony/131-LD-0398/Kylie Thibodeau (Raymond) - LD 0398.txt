LD 398
As a youth born and raised in Maine, I am proud of my home. I want to see our 
wonderful state continue to be “The Way Life Should Be” by improving our law in 
the labor sector. Our workers deserve the right to work overtime under fair laws and 
receive the appropriate pay. LD 398’s plan to phase in the proposed changes over 
time would provide a smooth transition; the bill recognizes that positive changes do 
not occur overnight. In the long term, this bill, LD 398 seeks to create a healthy and 
efficient workforce, with increased social and economic productivity and reliability, 
not only for farmers, but for all of Maine.
