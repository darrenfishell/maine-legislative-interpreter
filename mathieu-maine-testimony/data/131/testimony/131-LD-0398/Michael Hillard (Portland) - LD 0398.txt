Dear Labor and Education Committee,I am a Ph.D. economist who has taught at the University of Southern Maine with expertise in labor economics and labor relations.  It continues to be appalling to those who know the history and current conditions that agricultural workers are excluded from the most basic rights at work that all other workers enjoy.  The history is this: the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 shamefully excluded agricultural and service workers because of the power of white supremacist southern Senators and Congressmen. (For an authoritative account of this history, see Ira Katznelson, Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time (W.W. Norton, 2013)).  The reason was simple: race - as southern agricultural workers were Black Americans living under Jim Crow, these lawmakers saw to it that farmworkers did not gain basic rights at work.Maine currently continues the shameless practice of having minimum wages and hours regulations that exclude agricultural workers.  Agricultural workers in Maine can earn as little as $8 per hour (probably less) and are not guaranteed overtime pay.  LD 398 is a straightforward remedy to this continuing injustice.  As the pledge of allegiance says: “with liberty and justice for all.”  In the absence of this legislation, we merely have “justice for some” - not a state to be proud of in Maine.  Michael Hillard, Ph.D.
