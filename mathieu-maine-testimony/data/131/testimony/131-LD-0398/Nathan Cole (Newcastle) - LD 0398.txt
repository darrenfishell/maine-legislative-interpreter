LD 398
My name is Nathan Cole, and I wanted to express my support for LD 398, not only as
someone who has worked as a sea farmer for the past 5 years, but also someone who 
was raised on a new England farm. For most of my life, I have seen farm labor valued
far less than other work, and the people who work to produce our food suffer because 
of it. I think the exemption from fair labor law for farm labor is highly unethical, and 
does more to harm farming and farmers, than it does to help it. Bringing farm labor 
under the same protections as most other jobs is the right thing to do.
