An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Other Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and 
Hour Laws 
 
I am neither for nor against this bill. 
 
As an agritourism farm we have our agricultural employees work on weekends to assist with our Pick 
Your Own (PYO) operation. This is considered part of the retail operation and not agricultural work. 
This means that the entire week is considered retail work. So we are required to pay them overtime for 
anything over 40 hours. 
 
In order to cut down on overtime we have them either take a day off during the work week or work 
fewer hours daily. Working 7 days straight, even though the season is short, can lead to burnout. 
 
I assume that this must be a problem elsewhere in the farming community. 
 
Thank you for reading this. 
 
Respectfully submitted
