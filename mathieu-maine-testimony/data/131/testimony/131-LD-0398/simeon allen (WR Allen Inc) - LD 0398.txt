Dear Speaker Ross, and esteemed members of the Committee on Labor and Housing, 
my name is Simeon Allen and I am an Owner/General Manager of WR Allen Inc, We
are a small 5th generation wild Maine blueberry grower and processor located in 
Orland, Maine. 
Our Business owns/ operates about 500 acres of wild Maine blueberries on the blue 
hill peninsula and on an average grows, harvests, processes, and sells over 1 million 
pounds of wild Maine blueberries through-out the US. During the harvest we hire 30 
ag workers to harvest of fields.
If this bill was to pass it would have a negative impact on our business and a negative 
impact on the farm workers that we hire. As a business we would have no choice but 
to limit working hours to 40 hours per week due to the large increase in pay. Our farm
workers depend on working 60-70 hours per week to make as much money as they 
can in the short blueberry season. This will not only hurt WR Allen as a business, but 
it will also take food of the tables of our hard-working farm works that want to work 
as many hours as they possible can in such a short window.
Today I ask you to not pass this bill as it will not only have a negative impact on our 
business, but it will also be taking away the opportunity for our farm workers to 
“make hay while the sun shines.”
Thank you for your time on this important matter for the farming community!
