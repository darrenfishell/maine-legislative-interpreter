LD 398
Testimony in Support of LD 398 “An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Other 
Related Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws”
April 16, 2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing,
My name is Adrienne Horne, I am a resident of Appleton, and I am writing to you to 
share my support for LD 398 and the effort to provide farm workers access to 
overtime.
I support this bill because I want to live in a community where more of my neighbors 
have fair and safe working conditions. Currently, 25% of Maine farm workers live in 
poverty, making them 4.5x as likely to live in poverty as other Maine workers. Farm 
workers should have the same access to overtime as other workers across the state to 
ensure their fair pay and safe working conditions. I hope to see Maine join other states
including New York, Maryland, and Colorado in enacting laws to provide overtime to
farm workers, where it has proven to support workers without dramatically impacting 
farm productivity or cost to consumers. I want to know that when I buy local food to 
support the Maine economy, I’m also supporting my neighbors who are farm workers.
Thank you for considering my testimony and for all the work you do. I hope you join 
me in support of LD 398.
Sincerely,
Adrienne Horne
