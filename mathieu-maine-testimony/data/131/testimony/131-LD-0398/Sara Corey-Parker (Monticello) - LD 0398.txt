LD 398 “An Act To  Make Agricultural Workers and Other Related Workers Employees under 
the Wage and Hour Laws”  
 
Maine State Senators and Representatives:  
Maine agriculture is dealing with an increase in expenses unlike we have ever seen . Input costs 
are at an all time high and interest rates on operating loans are steadily increasing.  
The legislation LD 398 “An Act To Make Agricultural Workers and Other Related Workers 
Employees under the Wage and Hour Laws”  will provide that agricultural and seasonal 
employees are subject t o the laws that place limits on mandatory overtime. This bill would have 
a huge impact on the wages growers pay. In a survey completed by the Maine Potato Board, they 
estimated that the total impact of this bill to the Maine  potato industry could be well o ver $ 3 
million.  
Daniel Corey Farms, Nu -Seed Corp., and Seed Pro Inc. farm over 1 ,500 acres of seed potatoes, 
3,000 acres of small grains, and supply 45 full time job positions and about 75 seasonal positions 
in the State of Maine. We believe we cannot hand le this bill and that it will only hurt the 
agriculture industry as a whole and the agriculture workers as individuals.  
We beg you to vote ought not to pass on LD398.  
 
Thank you in advance,  
Sara Corey Parker
