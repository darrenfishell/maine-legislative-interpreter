LD 14 83: An Act to Protect the Rights of Agricultural Workers  
 
Dear Senator Tipping , Rep resentative  Roeder , and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing : 
 
My name is Mary Bonauto  and I am the Senior Director of Civil Rights at GLBTQ Legal 
Advocates & Defenders, a litigation and policy organization addressing issues affecting the 
LGBTQ people across communities in Maine, regionally, and nationally.  GLAD, together with 
EqualityMain e, Maine Transnet, Maine Women’s Lobby and ACLU of Maine thank the 
sponsors, Speaker Talbot Ross and Senator Hickman, for bringing forth th ese bills.  We all 
encourage you to vote ought to pass on each.  
As LGBTQ organizations or LGBTQ supportive organizati ons, we are familiar with 
discrimination in workplaces as well with being denied benefits and protections other workers 
have enjoyed.  Maine took steps to change this state of affairs over the years with enactment of a 
nondiscrimination law, domestic partn ership options in insurance, and with approving the 
freedom to marry at the ballot in 2012, among other public and private efforts. These efforts and 
legal changes have provided people more security, stability and peace of mind.  
With respect to LD 398 and LD 525, we believe all agricultural workers deserve this same 
security, stability and peace of mind through enactment of these three bills.1  The rights at issue 
are among the most basic for any worker, and LGBTQ people have not been barred from 
bargainin g or from wage and hour laws governing overtime and minimum pay.  There is also a 
history at work  that continues to harm people today and which we should leave behind, namely 
the historical exclusion of agricultural workers from the basic worker rights to  organize and 
 
1  Although data collection is lacking, outreach workers, clinicians and researchers who provide health care 
and public health interventions to farmworkers know that LGBTQIA+ people exist within the community” and have 
additional struggles related to their id entities. See Promoting Health Care Access for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) Farmworkers , National LGBTQIQ+ Health Education 
Center (2020), available at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.856878/full   
 
 
bargain collectively based on then prevalent beliefs about “race” and what workers “deserved” 
protections.2  
To be sure, it is often challenging for employers – including farm employers - to step up to 
provide better protections for workers.   Some of us know from close family members about how 
hard it is to work on and earn a living on a farm.  Still, we support these bills so that Maine can 
find a path forward where workers and their families’ needs are an essential part of the 
consideration  in our laws rather than being subordinated.  Real world experience also shows that 
the expansion of worker protections works in tandem with supporting workplaces and thus could 
easily assist  the development of farming in Maine.  Certainly, a more healthful and fair working 
environment will attract employees and better maintain their health, both of which are productive 
for any farm or business.   
With respect to LD 1483, we support the proposal to allow individuals employed in agriculture, 
industrial food proces sing as defined in the bill the ability to meet with “key service provider[s]” 
when they are “not performing work” or “during paid or unpaid rest or meal breakers.”  This is a 
necessity when workers have so little time they can otherwise meet with such pro viders given the 
time demands from their jobs. Likewise, we support the provision that an agricultural worker 
alone, not their employer, may decide who enters their residence, and that employers may not 
create barriers to access, whether physically or othe rwise.  None of us would find it tolerable to 
have the comings and goings into our residences so regulated by an employer.  
These workers share the same humanity, needs for economic stability and healthful conditions 
that othe rs share.  We urge you to find a path forward and thank you for your consideration.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on these bills.  
Truly yours,  
Mary L. Bonauto, GLAD , 257 Deering Ave., Suite 203 , Portland ME 04013
