In Support of LD 398 
 
The Rural Action Group Against Racism (RAGAR) thoroughly supports the passage of LD 398. The 
exemption of farm workers and domestic workers from the Federal Fair Standards Labor Act of 1938 
was an overtly racist maneuver to keep people of color ’enslaved’ in modern times. We need to put an 
end to this arrangement and ensure that ALL workers are protected against unfair pay practices and 
work regulations. Farm work is difficult AND necessary. Farm workers are necessary. The dignity of 
farm workers is crucial to the dignity of the work that brings food to our tables. 
 
We have heard testimony stating that the passage of this bill provides a unbearable burden on farm 
owners. That their businesses would fail if this bill passes. We adamantly disagree. A New York study 
found that the cost of paying overtime would represent 9% of farm income and if all the cost of 
overtime were passed along to consumers, it would represent a 2% increase in food costs. The reality 
would be a combination of both these factors. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Minnesota, Maryland, 
New York, Oregon, and Washington have all passed legislation that guarantees overtime pay for farm 
workers. Farms in these states continue to operate, with no greater failure than the national average. In 
addition to increased emotional and physical health for farm workers, benefits of overtime include less 
turnover, lower training costs, more local economic activity, and more sales tax revenue. 
 
You have the opportunity to reverse nearly 80 years of undisguised racism against a critical portion of 
our work force. We call on you to end these unfair labor practices and ensure that ALL workers are 
treated with the dignity they deserve and unanimously vote “Ought to Pass”
