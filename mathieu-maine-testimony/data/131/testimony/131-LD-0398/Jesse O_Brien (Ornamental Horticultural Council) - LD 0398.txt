Ornamental Horticulture Council 
Jesse O’Brien, Spokesperson 
April 18, 2023 
 
Opposed to LD 398 
“An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Others Related Workers 
Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws” 
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the joint committee of 
Labor and Housing my name is Jesse O’Brien and I am the spokesperson of the 
Ornamental Horticulture Council, OHC. We are a large diverse industry with 
thousands of businesses throughout the State. We care deeply for the environment 
and our employees. Many of our businesses offer bonuses for employees such as 
production goals, sales goals, end of season and returning to job the next season 
bonus. A bill like LD 398 would put an end to those bonuses.  
 
In addition, some of our industry businesses compete on a regionally and 
nationally basis. Federal law exempts overtime for agriculture nationally. LD 398 
would put our industry at a disadvantage against the other States.  Our sales 
outside the State have been increasing and bills such as LD 398 would threaten this 
growth.  
 
Thank you for your consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jesse O’Brien
