LD 398
I am writing in support of LD#398 to include farmworkers under the wage laws. This 
seems a no brainer to me. These people work very hard for long hours and for them to
be making less money than other workers is simply not fair. I know it is difficult for 
farmers and I think possibly the farmers need to be compensated with a subsidy but it 
is not the fault of the farm laborers who are supplying us with needed fresh food.
Please pass this bill.
Thanks you for your time.
