RE: Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 398, An Act To Make Agricultural Workers and Other Related 
Workers Employees Under the Wage and Hour Laws 
My name is Eric Venturini, and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine 
(WBC). I strive to represent the voices of Maine's 485 wild blueberry farmers. 
Our wild blueberry farmers cannot afford this bill. The Maine wild blueberry industry lost about 40% of 
its farms from 1997 to 2017, a twenty-year period? In the years since 2017, wild blueberry farms have 
contended with low field prices,2 repeated drought,3 chronic labor shortages, “ supply chain challenges, 
and skyrocketing input costs.5 Each year, a handful of our producers make the decision to stop farming. 
lfthis bill passes, many of Maine's small family farms will shut their doors for good. This is an economic 
reality.

This Bill in the 130"‘ Session 
This bill was introduced last session as LD 1022. In public hearing this Committee received written 
testimony from 127 people, agencies, and organizations. Ten percent testified in support, 2% neither for 
nor against, and 88% testified in opposition to this bill. Those opposed included small to medium sized 
vegetable farmers, small organic farmers, apple growers, dairy producers, potato growers, wild 
blueberry growers, and many others. 
I implore this Committee to listen to Maine's farming community and consider the real impact that this 
bill will have on them. 
Will this Bill Have the Impact Desired? 
It is my understanding that the intention of the sponsor is to provide farm workers with greater 
opportunity and greater levels of income. I respect that goal and I support it. 
However, cash strapped farmers unable to afford overtime will cap their workers at 40 hours per week. 
Rather than paying for overtime, farmers will try to hire additional workers to fulfill their workforce 
demands. If passed, migrant farm workers will spend the same amount of time away from home but will 
earn less money at the end of the season. 
Consider the hypothetical scenario where a wild blueberry farmer caps her workers at 40 hours per 
week. On many wild blueberry farms, a worker will work 1900 to 2000 hours, which is a full year's work, 
over a period of 7 months from April to November. Ifthat employee instead works that same period at 
only 40 hours per week: 
0 They would lose 600 to 690 hours of work per year, which equates to approximately 1/3 of their 
P3V- 
o For workers earning State minimum wage (a conservative estimate) this is a pay cut of $8,280— 
$9,522 per year. At farms with a higher wage scale, which is more common, a worker could 
experience a loss of $10,000 - $14,000 per year. 
Can't Farmers Just Raise Prices? 
No. It is easy to assume that if the cost of doing business increases, farmers can raise their prices, and 
maintain a stable profit margin. Most Maine wild blueberry producers sell a raw, unprocessed product 
and have no control over the price they receive for it. Producers that do sell a finished product to an 
end-user or a value-added buyer are competing with the fast-growing cultivated blueberry industry 
(whose frozen berries are their waste product and therefore cheap), and with our Canadian neighbors 
(who harvest much of their crop from govern ment-owned land, reducing their input costs). Neither of 
Canadian wild blueberry producers, or US and global cultivated blueberry farmers would be impacted by 
a change in Maine's law. Unable to raise prices to adjust for these costs, Maine growers would take the 
loss on the chin. Many would go out of business. 
A Labor Market in Crisis 
Today in Maine, in a post-COVID labor market, every sector is facing shortages. Maine's labor force

participation rate remains at the pandemic low of 58%, even as it rises elsewhere in the US.6 Many 
farmers are leaving fields unhan/ested. I spoke to two small producers a few weeks ago who are edging 
closer to shutting their doors because they cannot do all the work that a farm requires without reliable 
help—which they cannot find. These producers already pay well above the State minimum wage, but 
still cannot hire and maintain the reliable workforce they need.

Mandatory overtime will increase the agricultural sector's demand for workers as employers seek even 
more workers to avoid paying overtime. Increasing worker demand in this economy means that more 
businesses will go without the workforce they need, more crops will go unharvested, and more farms 
will go out of business. 
This bill will not raise overall earnings for Maine farm workers, and it will dramatically impact Maine's 
farming community. Please vote Ought Not To Pass. 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
