LD 398
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing: 
My name is Ana María. I am a resident of Portland and I am testifying in support of 
LD 398 and LD 525.  I believe LD 398 and LD 525 should become law because 
Maine agricultural workers are essential to the state’s sustenance. As a farmer myself,
I know the sweat and hard labor that agriculture requires. It is unfair that agricultural 
workers, those who make tremendous efforts to grow the food and raise the animals 
that sustain the citizens of Maine, are not well paid and unprotected by basic labor 
rights and laws. I personally stopped doing agricultural work, even though it is what I 
enjoy most, because I can’t live off of it. These two bills give you legislators an 
opportunity to protect the work and lives of those who feed us. The workers who 
bring the food to our tables and steward the land deserve to be protected by the same 
wage and hour laws and employee rights as the rest of the state’s workers.
I believe these two bills will contribute to a more prosperous future for farming and 
agriculture since they will provide a more sustainable labor model for farmers and 
agricultural workers. 
For all these reasons, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 398 and LD 525. 
Thank you,
Ana María Zabala
