The Effect of Minimum Wage and Overtime Laws on the Wages of Workers Paid on a Piece- 
Rate Basis 
Prepared by Michael Guare, Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Support of L.D. 398: 
“An Act to Make Agricultural Workers and Other Related Workers Employees 
under the Wage and Hour Laws” 
April 18, 2023 
Minimum wages and piece-rate pav 
Farm workers are often paid per unit of production — such as a certain amount per box of 
blueberries harvested (the piece rate) — rather than by the hour. Under existing law, a worker’s 
entitlement to the minimum wage is not dependent on the method of wage payment; workers 
who are paid by the piece are entitled to receive at least the minimum wage for every hour 
worked, even if they are paid by the piece; 29 CFR §776.5. Compliance with minimum wage 
requirements for piece-rate workers is calculated by dividing a worker’s piece-rate earnings fora 
workweek by the number of hours worked. If the resulting amount is equal to or greater than the 
minimum wage, minimum wage requirements have been met. If the resulting amount is less 
than the minimum wage, the employer is required to pay the difference for every hour worked 
during that workweek. 
It is not uncommon for employers to believe that it is not necessary to keep track of the hours 
actually worked by workers paid by the piece. However, it is important to note that keeping 
track of the hours actually worked by piece-rate workers paid does not impose any burden on 
employers which does not already exist: all agricultural employers are required by existing 
federal law to keep track of the hours worked by their workers whether they are paid by the hour 
or on a piece-rate basis; 29 U.S.C. §l82l(d)(l). 
Overtime and piece-rate pay 
Workers entitled to overtime pay are entitled to be paid 1‘/2 times their regular hourly rate for 
every hour worked in excess of the overtime threshold; 26 M.R.S.A. §664(3). The regular rate 
of pay for a piece-rate worker is calculated by dividing a worker’s piece-rate earnings fora 
workweek by the number of hours worked. Assuming that the resulting amount is at least equal 
to the minimum wage, the worker is entitled to 1% times that amount for every hour worked in 
excess of the overtime threshold.
