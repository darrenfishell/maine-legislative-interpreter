Senator, District 34 131st Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Testimony of Senator Joe Raﬂerty in Support of 
LD 149, An Act to Amend the Deﬁnition of “Homestead ” under the Homestead Property 
Tax Exemption Laws 
Before the Senate Committee on Judiciary 
Tuesday, February 7, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Taxation. My name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the people of SD 34 including 
Berwick, North Berwick, Wells, Kemrebunk and Kennebunkpoit. 
I’m here today to speak in support of LD 149, An Act to Amend the Deﬁnition of “Homestead ” 
under the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Laws. 
Currently, the lavvprovides that one of the qualiﬁcations for a homestead exemption requires that 
real property held in trust must be held in a revocable living trust. The passage of LD 149 would 
create a change removing the word “revocable ”. 
Thank you for your time and consideration to this request. 
Joe Rafferty
