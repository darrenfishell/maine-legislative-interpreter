Testimony of Senator  Joe Rafferty  in Support of  
LD 149, An Act to Amend the Definition of “Homestead” under the Homest ead Property Tax 
Exemption Laws  
Before the Senate  Committee on Judiciary  
 
Tuesday , February 7, 2023  
 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Committee on Taxation. My 
name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the people of SD 34 including Berwick, North Berwick, 
Wells, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport.    
 
I’m here today to s peak in support of LD 149, An Act to Amend the Definition of “Homestead” under 
the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Laws.    
 
Currently, the law provides that one of the qualifications for a homestead exemption requires that real 
property held in trust mus t be held in a revocable living trust. The passage of LD 149 would create a 
change removing the word “revocable” . 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration to this request .
