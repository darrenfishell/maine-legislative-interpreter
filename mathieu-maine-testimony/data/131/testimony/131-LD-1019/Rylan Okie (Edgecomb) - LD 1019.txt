As a business located on Davis Island, we supply drinking water for our employees. 
This costs $1,000 a year and continues to rise with the increase in water delivery from
ReadyRefresh by Nestle.
As a pottery business, we also have an issue with iron deposits in our clay. Once these
deposits are fired our products have iron spots that appear as flaws in our pottery, 
causing us to discount the products with the iron spots. 
Furthermore, we have had to replace toilets and sinks due to poor water quality.
