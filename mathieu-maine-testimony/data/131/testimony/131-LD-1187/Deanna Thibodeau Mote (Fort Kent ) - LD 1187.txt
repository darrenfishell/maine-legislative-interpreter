NMMC psychiatric services have been a lifeline for my sister, and consequently, to 
our entire family. Access to the care provided at the inpatient facility has made it 
possible for her to continue living independently and to maintain therapeutic 
relationships with her therapist and with her psychiatrist. Our family knows first hand 
the feeling of reassurance and comfort in knowing that, if she is suffering an acute 
psychiatric crisis, she has access to the care she needs to be safe and to the tools that 
she needs for her to return to a state of mental health stability. Without access to these
services, she would not thrive as she does. 
I work in the health care industry as a nurse practitioner. I know first hand the impact 
on the lives of patients and their families when they are able to receive care from 
knowledgeable, caring and capable providers. Iâ€™ve also seen the detrimental impact of
lack of access to health care services. 
The people of the St John Valley deserve to continue receiving top notch psychiatric 
care at NMMC. This contributes positively to the wellbeing of patients, their families 
and to the community as a whole. 
 
Most sincerely
