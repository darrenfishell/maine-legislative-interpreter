Re:  LD 1187 – An Act to Protect Inpatient Psychiatric Services in Northern Maine by 
Preserving the Current Reimbursement Rate  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is submitted in  opposition  to LD 1187, An Act to Protect Inpatient Psychiatric Services 
in Northern Maine by Preserving the Current Reimbursement Rate . This bill prohibits the 
Department of Health and Human Services from decreasing the reimbursement rate for distinct 
psychiatric unit discharges for Northern Maine Medical Center (NMMC) or its successor hospital 
without legislative approval . 
 
This bill conf licts with P.L. 2021, ch 639 , which  was in part a directive for the Department to move 
toward consistent, equitable and data driven rates that create incentives for efficiency and high -
quality care for members. This bill seeks to create an exception for a single  provider  of distinct 
unit inpatient psychiatric and substance use disorder services to the standard  reimbursement  
methodology that has been developed with input from stakeholders  for a planned July 1, 2023 
effective date , circumvent ing P.L. 2021, c h 639 . 
 
This bill also conflicts with the recently passed supplemental budget. P.L. 2023, ch  3, Part S , which  
mandates that the Department “…provide reimbursement for patients discharged from psychiatric 
inpatient units and inpatient substance use disorder  units so that the initial rate is set to provide 
100% aggregate cost reimbursement for providers based upon 2022 data.” MaineCare 
reimbursement to N orthern Maine Medical Center (NMMC)  for these services already exceeds the 
allowable costs NMMC report s for these services. Holding NMMC rates for these services 
harmless  provides reimbursement specific to NMMC that exceeds 100% aggregate cost 
reimbursement,  and also does not use 2022 data .  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider th is bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Michelle Probert , Director  
MaineCare Services
