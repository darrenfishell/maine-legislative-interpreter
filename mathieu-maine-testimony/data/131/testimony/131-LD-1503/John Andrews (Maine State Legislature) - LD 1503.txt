This duty of state government includes providing a remedy for damages against Federal ofﬁcials 
who violate the constitutional rights of state citizens. This is because a constitutional right is 
meaningless unless it has a remedy. No such remedy exists today in Maine. In Maine you should 
be able to sure that the Federal employee who violated your rights and not have to take on the 
Federal government. LD 1503 would establish this protection going forward. 
The principles of federalism and state sovereignty allow for states to do this. In fact, they dictate 
that the federal govemment cannot control the availability of remedies in the State of Maine and 
its courts. 
A violation of Mainers’ rights by a Federal employee diminishes the lives, liberty, and property 
of the people of Maine. 
A right Without a remedy is worthless. This is Why I urge you to pass LD 1503 out of committee. 
It is imperative that we establish a mechanism and standard in Maine’s state courts to remedy 
constitutional violations and infringements against Maine citizens by Federal employees. 
Respectfully 
Representative John Andrews 
Maine House District 79
