Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1503, An Act Regarding 
State Court Remedies for Violations of Legal or Constitutional Rights by 
Federal Employees: 
 
 Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony with respect to this bill. 
 
 The Judicial Branch declines to take a position on the merits of this bill. The public 
policy behind it clearly falls within the realm of the Legislative Branch. 
 
 We only comment on subsection 4 of the bill titled “Judicial process.” We would 
respectfully suggest that judicial process for all types of civil proceedings is thoroughly 
described and set forth in the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. These rules are promulgated by 
the Supreme Judicial Court, with frequent input and suggested amendments by the Civil Rules 
Committee, comprised of judges, judicial branch staff, practitioners who represent both plaintiffs 
and defendants, and others. We also believe that subsection 4 addresses issues within the 
province of the Judicial Branch and not the Legislative Branch as a matter of separation of 
powers. For these reasons, and in order to avoid any conflicts, we would respectfully ask that 
subsection 4 be removed, if this bill moves forward. 
 
 Thank you for your time.
