Testimony
of
Sasha
Shunk,
state
licensed
and
nationally
accredited
family
child
care
provider,
In
opposition
to
LD
1061
“An
Act
to
Increase
the
Number
of
Children
a
Family
Child
Care
Provider
May
Care
for
Without
Having
to
Be
Licensed
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Service”
March
21st,
2023
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
distinguished
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Sasha
Shunk
I
have
been
a
licensed
family
child
care
provider
in
Portland,
Maine
for
almost
20
years
and
nationally
accredited
for
the
past
16
years.
I’m
testifying
in
opposition
of
LD
1061
which
increases
the
number
of
children
that
can
be
served
in
unlicensed
care
homes.
I
understand
the
thought
behind
the
bill,
Maine
has
a
childcare
crisis.
In
Portland
there
are
literally
not
enough
childcare
slots
for
the
number
of
children
who
live
here.
Increasing
the
number
of
children
an
unlicensed
provider
can
care
for
is
not
the
solution
to
this
problem.
The
change
LD
1061
would
make
could
actually
allow
an
unlicensed
provider
to
care
for
more
children
than
a
licensed
provider.
How
you
may
ask?
A
licensed
childcare
provider
in
Maine
can
currently
care
for
6
children,
3
under
the
age
of
2
and
3
over
the
age
of
2.
Licensed
providers
must
count
their
own
children
under
the
age
of
4
in
these
ratios.
Let’s
say
the
unlicensed
provider
has
3
non-school
aged
children
of
their
own.
Then
an
unlicensed
provider
cares
for
an
additional
4
children,
which
they
are
allowed
to
do
under
this
proposed
rule.
This
scenario
has
the
single
provider
caring
for
7
non-school
aged
children,
1
more
than
currently
allowed
for
licensed
child
care
providers.
Maine’s
licensing
rules,
in
my
opinion,
are
not
overly
complicated
or
stringent.
They
do
the
job
of
protecting
the
children
of
Maine
and
supporting
their
healthy
development.
Those
interested
in
becoming
a
licensed
family
child
care
provider
have
a
variety
of
support,
such
as
the
Maine
Roads
to
Quality’s
First
Steps
to
Family
Child
Care
community
of
practice
which
is
free
and
meets
monthly.
The
Family
Child
Care
Association
of
Maine
offers
a
business
tool
kit
on
their
website
which
is
free
to
everyone
and
helps
to
support
providers
through
the
licensing
process.
If
your
goal
is
to
help
alleviate
the
strain
on
Maine’s
child
care
system,
I
would
suggest
focusing
efforts
on
workforce
development,
which
includes
supporting
licensed
family
child
care
providers.
I
would
also
encourage
you
to
support
the
early
care
and
education
organizations
within
our
state,
such
as
Family
Child
Care
Association
of
Maine,
MaineAEYC,
and
Maine
Roads
to
Quality.
LD
1061
is
not
the
right
choice
for
Maine’s
children.
I
strongly
urge
you
to
oppose
this
bill.
Sincerely,
S a s h a
