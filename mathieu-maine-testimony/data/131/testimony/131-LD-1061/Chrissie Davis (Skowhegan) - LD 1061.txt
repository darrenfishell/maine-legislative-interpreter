Testimony of Chrissie Davis
In Opposition of LD 1061, “An Act to Increase the Number of Children a Family Child Care 
Provider May Care for Without Having to Be Licensed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services" 
March 21st, 2023
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Health and Human Services, my 
name is Chrissie Davis and I am a Family Child Care Educator from Skowhegan.
I’m testifying in opposition of LD 1061 which increases the number of children that can be 
served in unlicensed care homes.  I understand the goal of creating more child care openings 
for children, but this is not the solution.
The Office of Child and Family Services has requirements for health and safety standards for 
licensed child care facilities.  These are in place to ensure that children are cared for in 
environments that are able to meet the unique needs of children in group care.  In addition, 
children deserve high quality early care that fosters growth in all areas of development.  Quality 
early care providers are well trained professionals who are knowledgeable about child 
development and provide care that meets the changing needs of young children and their 
families.   Unlicensed, unregulated, unmonitored care is not quality care and, therefore, not in 
the best interest of children or families.
 
Thank you for reading my testimony and I ask you to please vote against the passage of this 
bill.
