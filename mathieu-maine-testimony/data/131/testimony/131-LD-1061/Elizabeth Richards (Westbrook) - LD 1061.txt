I have been an early childhood professional for more than 30 years.  I have worked 
and/or observed in a wide range of settings, and it is my firm belief that being 
required to have a license helps keep children safe.  The rules set out by licensing 
hold providers accountable for basic safety guidelines and best practices for children. 
Caring for multiple children is a difficult, important job.  Licensed providers offer 
families peace of mind, knowing that their provider has standards to uphold.  I feel it 
would be a mistake to allow caring for more than two children not your own without a
license.
