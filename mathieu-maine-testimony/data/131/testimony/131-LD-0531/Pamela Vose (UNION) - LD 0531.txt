LD 531
I am writing in opposition to LD 531.  As a landowner I feel that this adding to the 
time that dogs can be in the woods is wrong.   Others that recreate and enjoy their 
property for purposes other than hunting have been ignored by the state of Maine.   
We are the majority and we vote and pay taxes.   Some of us appreciate that wildlife 
needs time to live and thrive as nature intended.   You can't disturb the natural process
continually without causing problems.
