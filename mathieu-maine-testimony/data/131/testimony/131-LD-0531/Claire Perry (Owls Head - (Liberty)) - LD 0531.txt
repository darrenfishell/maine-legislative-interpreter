TESTIFYING -AGAINST
Senator La Fountain, Representative Landry and Committee Members:
I think it to be unwise, to allow more dogs running at large in our woods during prime
tourist season....where so many are walking, hiking and camping with family; that 
includes their own dogs (required to be leashed) and of course, children.  
Now that LMF funds will be opening thousands of new acres for public use, I'd think 
twice about the sobering fact that packs of  hound dogs...trained to chase and 
attack....can be running-at-large on these public lands, (all year long) but especially 
while a significant number of people will be recreating there as well.  This bill will 
add even more dogs to their numbers. The chances of an encounter may not be great, 
but it will only take one time for what happened in Ripton Vermont to happen right 
here in Maine. 
Lastly, is there even a need to train a dog to chase and tree a squirrel ? All of mine did
it naturally !  Squirrels "tree" automatically....and it seems the training season is 
unusually long for the purpose at hand.
