Re: LD 531  â€“ An Act to Add Gray Squirrels to the Species List for the Open Training Season for 
Hunting Dogs  
 
Dear Senator Lafontaine , Representative Landry, and Members of the Committee o n Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife,  
 
Backcountry Hunters & Anglers seeks to ensure North America's outdoor heritage of hunting 
and fishing in a natural setting. Our members support the North American Model of Wildlife 
Conservation, which asserts that wildlife is held in public trus t as a scientifically managed 
resource for the benefit of all Americans.  
 
Squirrels are relatively abundant in southern Maine where oaks are common, and squirrel 
hunting is an excellent way to introduce hunting to those who are new to the sport.  As with 
other game species commonly hunted with the assistance of dogs, using trained dogs to hunt 
squirrels increases the chance of success and adds depth to the hunting experience.  We urge 
the Committee to support LD 531 and thereby provide increased opportunity  for hunters.  
   
Sincerely,
