Committee Chairs and members,
Oppose LD 531 - An Act to Add Gray Squirrels to the Species List for the Open 
Training Season for Hunting Dogs
Squirrel populations fluctuate and not too long ago the take and/or season was 
reduced. Adding training with hounds and it will put more stress ont he population.
I am unclear if this bill is asking for training with live trapped grey squirrels, or just 
permission to encourage dogs to chase them in the field.
There should be no need of either-I had a dog many years ago that looked like a black
long haired collie. I let her out one morning and watched her catch, kill and bury a red
squirrel in under ten seconds. 
Training dogs for squirrel can be accomplished using a legally obtained squirrel tail.
Lastly, are dogs currently allowed in the pursuit of squirrel? If the squirrel population 
isn't dense enough that a hunter can't easily find some, is it good for the population to 
use dogs to sniff out every grey squirrel in an area?  
Squirrels are the caretakers of our forests, pruning, planting, eating insects-do we 
really want to tank the population with the use of dogs?
Please oppose LD 531 - An Act to Add Gray Squirrels to the Species List for the 
Open Training Season for Hunting Dogs
