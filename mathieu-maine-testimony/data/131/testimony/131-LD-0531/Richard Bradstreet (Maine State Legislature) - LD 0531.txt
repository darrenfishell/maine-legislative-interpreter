RE: LD 531 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, l'm Representative Dick Bradstreet of 
House District 61, comprised of my home town of Vassalboro and most of Sidney. l'm here this 
morning to present to you LD 531, An Act to Add Gray Squirrels to the Species List for the Open 
Training Season for Hunting Dogs. 
This matter was brought to me by a constituent who requests to add gray squirrels to 
the current list of animals upon which a person may train dogs during the open training season 
for dogs. Currently, dogs may be trained to hunt foxes, snowshoe hare and raccoons during the 
period from July 1 through the following March 31. All other regulations under the statute that 
you see in the bill will remain the same. This bill is a straight forward request and simply adds 
gray squirrels to the current list. 
I believe my constituent will be testifying shortly after me, laying out the reasons for this 
bill. I hope you will listen to his testimony and act favorably on this bill by reporting it out asa 
unanimous "Ought to Pass." Thank you for your time and attention.
