LD 531 "An act to add grey squirrels to the species list on the open training season for hunting dogs‚Äù 
Good morning. My name is Brittany Currier and l am here representing the Maine Sporting Dog Association. We are here today to support the act to add gray Squirrels to the Species List for 
the Open Training Season for Hunting Dogs. 
We are incredibly supportive and love to see other outlets for working dogs and for those that 
might not have the time, resources and/or the desire to hunt larger game. While squirrel 
hunting with dogs is not really recognized in the State of Maine right now, it will be great to 
have guidelines established for others beginning to get into the sport. 
The Maine Sporting Dog Association believes that every sportsman should be allowed to have 
ample time in the woods to ethically and legally do what they are passionate about, which is 
why we are in support of LD 531. 
Thank you
