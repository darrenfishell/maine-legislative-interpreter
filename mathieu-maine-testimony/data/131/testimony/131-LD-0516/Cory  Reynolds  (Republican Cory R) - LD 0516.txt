LD 516
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Republican Cory Reynolds I am testifying today 
in Support Of LD 516, An 
 Act to Reduce Cancer Among Firefighters by Providing Grants for Safety 
Equipment.
Firefighters are at risk for cancer because of the carcinogens they encounter while on 
the job. This bill would create the Firefighter Safety Equipment Fund, allowing the 
Maine Fire Protection Services Committee to provide grants to fire departments for 
new fire gear, and other equipment to limit exposure to chemicals. I urge you to vote 
ought to pass on LD-516. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
