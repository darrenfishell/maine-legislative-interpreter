TESTIMONY OF RICHARD MCCARTHY 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
(Neither for Nor Against) L.D. 516 
"An Act to Reduce Cancer Among Firefighters by Providing Grants 
for Safety Equipment" 
Presented by: Representative Landry 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
AND PUBLIC SAFETY 
Hearing Date: Monday, March 27th, 2023, at 10:00 AM in Room 436, State House 
Good morning, Senator Be _ebeâ€”Center, Representative 
Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety. 
My name is Richard McCarthy, and lam the State Fire 
Marshal, I am here today representing the Department of 
Public Safety and the Office of State Fire Marshal to testify 
neither for nor against this bill. 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death within the Fire 
service. For years there was not the knowledge that we 
currently have in reference to hazards that fire fighters 
encounter each day. In the past it was a badge of honor to 
have gear that was soiled showing that you had been active at 
fire scenes, now we know that this gear contains cancer causing
chemicals that we would take off put in our gear bag throw it in 
your vehicle and stand by for the next call. My gear bag sat in 
the back seat of my truck for many years. This bill would 
provide funding for departments to apply to purchase 
equipment to clean gear to remove all the harmful chemicals. 
We understand that this is not part of the Governors current 
budget, and the difficulties that this creates. But we support 
whole heartedly the prevention of cancer in fire fighters. . 
Thank you for your time today and I would be happy to 
answer any questions you may have at this time or during the 
work session.
