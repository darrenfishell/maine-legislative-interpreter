Re: LD 1469, Resolve, to Sufficiently Staff Overnight Behavioral Health Crisis Facilities  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer  and M embers of the Committee on Health and Human 
Services :  
 
Thank you  for the opportunity to provide input on LD 1469, Resol ve, to Sufficiently Staff 
Overnight Behavioral Health Crisis Facilities . The Department is neither for nor against  this 
proposed bill and we offer this letter to the  Committee with information for your consideration.  
 
This Resolve  requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules requiring a 
facility providing overnight behavioral health crisis services to establish staffing ratios based on a 
clinical assessment of the acuity of the residential milieu and not fewe r than one staff person to 
every 3 clients between the hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and one staff person to every 4 clients between 
the hours of 7 p.m. to 7 a.m . 
 
Under current Department rules ( specifically,  “Crisis Residential Service Standards”) for agencies 
providing these crisis residential services, the Department does not require  any minimum staffing 
ratios , while there  are minimum staffing ratios for other residential settings, such as residential 
care and PNMI. So, adding minimum staffing ratios  here would not be novel, however,  this would 
be the only minimum staffing requirement for this specific type of setting. We do believe the 
language in the bill does not explain  the type or minimum qualifications  of staff required for the  
proposed  minimum staff ratios . 
 
Also, as you have heard this session, DLC  is in the process of updating the rules that govern 
residential settings, and we have a  global plan to simplify and clarify rules applying to all 
residenti al setting  types following the passage of  LD 475 and LD 449 . 
 
I would be happy to answer any questions you may have and will attend your work session if 
needed.  
  
Sincerely,   
  
 
Bill Montejo, Director
