RE: An Act to Require Students to Demonstrate Knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and the 
Maine Constitution. 
DATE: February 16, 2023 
LD 222 appears to revise diploma requirements for social studies by specifying that students 
demonstrate knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and the Maine Constitution. As required by 
§4706 and,§6209, Maine students are exposed to, and assessed on, the U.S. Constitution 
and the Maine Constitution. LD 222 seems to be redundant unless the intent is to createa 
speciﬁc test/assessment that students will be required to take in order to demonstrate 
knowledge of the US Constitution and Maine Constitution. If this bill proposes a testing 
requirement, and not as speciﬁed in §4722 "by evidence documented by course and learning 
experiences using multiple measures, including examinations, quizzes, portfolios, 
performances, exhibitions, projects and community service, "then the Maine Council for 
Social Studies is opposed to the creation of a standardized test to replace ways in which 
students are demonstrating knowledge of these topics as defined by local schools.
