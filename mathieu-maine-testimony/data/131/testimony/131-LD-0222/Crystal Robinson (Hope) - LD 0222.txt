Thank you for taking my testimony.  I strongly support requiring students to 
demonstrate knowledge of the constitution of our federal and Maine Constitutions.    
This is one of the most important bills in the legislature.  How can one be a citizen if 
one does not know its laws and our rights?   
Too many people, politicians included, refer to our nation as a democracy when that 
couldn't be further from the truth.  Our founders did everything in their power to 
ensure that we were not a democracy.  James Madison said that democracy is the 
most vile form of government.  Pure democracy leads to mob rule and tyranny.  The 
word democracy does not appear in our federal constitution nor in any of the state 
constitutions.
I strongly urge you to pass this bill.  Thank you for your time.
