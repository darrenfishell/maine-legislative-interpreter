Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1157:
“An
Act
to
Stabilize
Licensing
Fees”
Senator
Curry,
Representative
Roberts,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Innovation,
Development,
Economic
Advancement
and
Business,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1157
.
This
bill
is
necessary
because
it
would
ensure
that
licensing
fees
are
only
as
high
as
they
must
be
in
order
for
the
department
to
administer
the
program.
It
would
guarantee
that
Mainers
will
not
be
forced
to
pay
any
more
than
is
necessary
to
simply
earn
a
living
in
their
desired
profession.
Maine’s
occupational
licensing
regime
is
already
out
of
control.
A
2017
report
from
the
Institute
for
Justice
found
that
Maine
requires
a
license
for
44
different
low-income
professions,
1
up
from
39
in
their
2012
review.

Anything
to
lessen
the
burden
on
Maine
workers
and
entrepreneurs
is
a
worthy
cause.
Legislators
must
recognize
that
any
fee
extracted
from
a
working
Mainer,
in
order
to
practice
their
profession,
is
taking
money
out
of
their
family’s
mouths.
Any
fee
taken
from
someone
by
a
bureaucratic
agency
must
not
be
to
the
detriment
of
that
worker
(beyond
the
burden
of
licensing
is
itself).
This
is
a
basic
principle
of
good
governance.
The
Legislature
should
protect
the
earnings
of
hard-working
Mainers
and
ensure
licensing
fees
reflect
only
what
is
necessary
for
the
state
to
administer
the
licensing
program.
Please
deem
LD
1157
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
ensure
that
working
Mainers
are
not
punished
with
excessive
fees
to
simply
work
in
their
field.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
