TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
LD 1613, An Act to Prohibit Profiling and to Strengthen Civil Rights in Maine  
 
Good morning, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen  and distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Vivian Mikhail, and I am a Deputy Attorney General in the Office of the Maine Attorney General. I am 
testifying today in support of LD 1613, An Act to Prohibit Profiling and to Strengthen Ci vil Rights in Maine.  
Our Office supports codifying the current prohibitions against profiling that exist both in the Maine Constitution 
as well as in the Criminal Justice Academy Minimum Standards Hate or Bias Crimes Policy, and we have been working 
alongs ide the Speaker on this effort. Codifying these critical prohibitions sends the appropriate message that bias -based 
law enforcement actions  are not tolerated or legal. It is critical that all Maine residents know that profiling is a 
prohibited practice.   
We are also supportive of codifying the current requirement that each law enforcement agency designate a 
specific civil rights officer. The Office of the Attorney General relies on local law enforcement to identify and refer cases  
that might be appropriate  for enforcement under the Maine Civil Rights Act. These O fficers are specially trained to 
recognize potential bias -based activity, which may not otherwise be identified. Civil rights officers play an invaluable role 
in protecting Mainers from bias -motivat ed conduct.  
Lastly, since the 130th Legislature’s passage of LD 132, requiring law enforcement agencies to collect information 
about persons stopped for traffic violations, our Office has been working diligently on implementation of this complex 
project. In doing so we have grappled with technological requirements and challenges around collection of data from 
disparate law enforcement agencies’ records systems and meth ods used around the state, and we require more time to 
address these issues before we can  proceed to rulemaking.  The bill therefore changes the deadline for our Office’s 
rulemaking from January of this year to January of next year, and for law enforcement agencies to begin reporting their 
traffic stop profiling data to our Office from July of this year to July of next year. The Office of the Attorney General’s 
first annual report will then issue in January of 2025. We deeply appreciate the Speaker’s support of extending the deadlines so that our Office can continue to work toward an implementation of the program that yields effective data 
and analysis for the legislature’s consideration.  
Thank you for your time and we are happy to answer any questions you may have now or at the work session.
