Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1613 - An Act to Prohibit Profiling and to Strengthen Civil Rights in Maine  
April 26, 2023 
 
 Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is 
Rebecca Graham, and I am submitting testimony, neither for nor against LD 1613, An Act to Prohibit 
Profiling and to Strengthen Civil Rights in Maine , on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association, which 
represents the interests of municipal government before the Legislature. The positions of the Association are established by our 70 member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC).  
 Last session a bill with this text as well as a fiscal note to achieve appropriate data collection was 
voted unanimously out of two committees with bipartisan support for the full appropriation, part from the Highway Budget, as well as a recommendation from the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee 
with and amendment to had the staffing necessary for the collection of data in the current E- Citation 
system housed with in the Department of Public Safety Committee. While the bill received bi- partisan 
support, and approval from the Transportation Committee for the budget appropriation, it somehow did 
not make it through the Appropriations process and died on the table.  
 While this bill includes the language which was agreed between all stakeholders last year, it is 
missing the vital appropriation necessary to prevent this from becoming a mandate on municipal and 
county agencies with no recourse, the program to collect the data in a way that is protected from corporate 
interests, and is now a mandate on those agencies to collect and report data they do not need to collect 
beyond what is provided when an individual is issued with a summons.  
 Because the data is required for all police contacts, including those without a criminal or moving 
violation, it risks collecting data that is of interest for insurance companies  and fa lls within the public 
information disclosure outside the E- Citation module, which can be enhanced to collect warning data for 
the purposed of collecting racial perceptions. For these reasons, it is vital that the system to collect the 
information desired by LD 1613 is protected from public disclosure as well as connected to the 
centralized E -Citation system where possible. Agencies across the state do not share information, collect 
it in the same ways, have equal access to systems to collect the information  desired, and thus will not 
achieve the goals desired by the collection effort in a meaningful way.  
 For data to be collected that is useable and able to be trusted, it must be collected consistently 
from 1 35 different agencies and aggregated by staff eit her inside the Attorney General’s Office in 
whatever format received, or simply could be accessed in a consistent way by allowing agencies to use 
the E- Citation and E -Warning system.  

 Officials ask that you honor the efforts initiated last year to fund the appropriate system, and the 
State level IT staff to assist agencies connecting to the system at a bare minimum. Otherwise, the efforts 
envisioned by this bill will not produce usable data in a meaningful way. To that end, I have included the 
information from last year’s effort and ask you to consider protecting both the individuals who interact 
with the police  and allowing  all agencies an avenue to comply with the uniformity the State system 
provides.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
In Support of 
 
LD 1999- An Act To Require Civil Rights Officers at Law Enforcement Agencies  
March 4, 2022
 
Senator Deschambault , Representative Warren, and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am testifying in support of LD 1999 on behalf of 
the Maine Municipal Association and at the direction of our 70- member Legislative Policy Committee.  
Last year, LD 132, An Act To Implement the Attorney General's Recommendations on Data 
Collection in Order To Eliminate Profiling in Maine  went into effect with a fiscal note that did not 
appropriately fund the cost of the statewide system to implement the Attorney General’s 
recommendations, and endangered grant funding for non- state funded agencies to meet the mandate 
because available in car technologies for recording the necessary data in a timely way need to have a 
public safety nexus for their funding.  
MMA contacted Rep. Talbot Ross this summer and asked if she would put in a bill that would 
correct the fiscal errors of LD 132 and appropriately fund a system that would provide a public safety nexus and lighten the burden for the mandate on participating agencies as well as collect the data in a 
useable, uniform, and timely way.  
Stakeholders including the Attorney General’s Office, Department of Public Safety, Maine 
Sheriff’s Association, Maine Chiefs of Police Association, The American C ivil Liberties Union, university 
researchers and Maine Municipal Association met consistently from September until January to work on 
multiple drafts of the proposed legislation.  
All law enforcement stakeholders support the goals of collecting the data th at will provide an 
accurate picture of Maine traffic enforcement while reducing the burden of locally funded agencies. 
Stakeholders feel the state level program is the only way to collect this information in a meaningful or operational way.  
It’s important to note that racial data from traffic stops has been collected in the past by similar 
initiatives in narrative and non- searchable ways and was never utilized as a result. For data to be usable 
and informative, particularly as the Attorney General’s (AG’s)  recommendations require, it must be 
uniformly collected and timely in capture.  

This bill proposes to fully fund the state system known as e -citation and an additional module 
known as e -warning to collect traffic related contact information and issue summonses.  The system for e -
citation and e -warning will provide a uniform system allowing all participating officers to capture this 
mandated data, issue traffic violations more efficiently with less time on spent on handwriting summonses 
and reduce data e ntry errors from the automatic import of driver’s license information that is then 
transmitted directly to the court.  
Additionally, because traffic violations have a public safety nexus, agencies without in car 
terminals and printers will be able to use f ederal funding and other public safety grants to acquire the 
additional technology. This is incredibly important to relief the local burden on county and municipal 
agencies.  
While MMA has not had the opportunity to place the additional language pieces added to the bill 
before our Legislative Policy Committee, and thus cannot take an official position, we feel they do not 
operationally change what is already in existence.  
The Maine Criminal Justice Academy already requires civil rights officers by policy and hosts the 
AG’s training for those officers for all agencies. Codifying this in statute will not change that and may 
provide a public education opportunity to help convey the work already happening there. Additionally, 
racial profiling is illegal and cod ifying this in the same section of law under Maine’s Civil Rights Act 
would appear to simply emphasis this in the appropriate section of law.  
What is key in this bill is that this legislature passed a bill in the first session for the collection of 
inform ation that the state feels is important to advance equity and policing goals but did so without the 
necessary support to achieve it while the mandate is already in law. Municipal officials ask that you pass 
this bill with the changes to Title 5 included so  that our police can meet their mandate appropriately and 
provide this committee with Maine based data in the future to inform public policy.

In Support of   
LD 1999-  An Act To Prohibit Profiling and To Strengthen Civil Rights in Maine  
& 
LD 1859-  An Act To Establish the Maine Emergency Services Community Grant Program  
 
April 5, 2022 
 
 
Senator Breen, Representative Pierce and members of the Appropriations Committee, my 
name is Rebecca Graham and I am providing testimony in support of LD 1999 and LD 1859 that 
have been placed on the special appropriations table on behalf of MMA’s Legislat ive Policy 
Committee.  
 
LD 1999 
 Last session the Legislature enacted LD 132, An Act To Implement the Attorney General's 
Recommendations on Data Collection in Order To Eliminate Profiling in Maine , without the 
Governor’s signature because of fatal funding f laws created in the enactment process that failed 
to address the operational aspects of the bill. As a result, the bill’s goals are unachievable and place an enormous unfunded burden on Maine’s largely local law enforcement agencies. Without a correction t o fully fund and create a centralized traffic violation system identified in LD 132 
which would harmonize the data collection across the 135 different agencies, at best, the data desired will be collected by inconsistent methods dependent on unreliable funding systems, and ultimately meaningless.   
 At worst, the LD 132 data reporting requirement can be ignored as the enactment failed 
to meet the Constitutional requirement to enact laws that overwhelmingly impact local government duties with a mandate pream ble or the provision of 90 percent funding for the 
additional task. It is for these reasons that MMA connected with Rep. Talbot Ross to ask for a new legislative solution.  
  Municipal officials and law enforcement professionals believe it is vital to base future 
policy off solid and reliable Maine data, but also to lead the way with regard to transparency and processes for the protection of civil rights for all. MMA, Maine Chiefs of Police Association, Maine State Police, and Maine Sheriffs’ Association wor ked in good faith with the sponsor over 

seven months to rectify the issues created during the appropriations process identified by the 
Governor and stakeholders last year via enactment LD 132.   
LD 1999 corrects the operational problems created by enactment without the full 
appropriation, while providing additional statutory changes to make what is current law, Maine 
Criminal Justice Academy requirements and expected law enforcement practice more transparent 
and explicit for the public benefit.  
 
The fiscal  note on the bill fully funds the cost of creating a centralized data collection 
system tied to traffic enforcement activity that unifies information collection at the state level. The system provides an additional benefit to the court system by reducing data entry and mistakes through the direct importation of license data from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and transmission of the violation into the Violation Bureau system. The system may also improve officer safety on traffic stops by reducing the time spe nt on the side of the road handwriting a 
summons. The final benefit allows for a single system to collect the data required by the previously enacted LD 132 in a timely way for agencies that would otherwise be required to add the information several hours or days later with questionable accuracy and in a variety of different formats.  
 To date, no other state has enacted a bill that impacts all law enforcement agencies 
uniformly to collect this type of data.  This is because all agencies have different data  systems, 
technical capacity,  funding mechanisms and traffic enforcement volumes. Such data collection  
efforts have only been locally led and designed by individual agencies in consultation with community stakeholders. The Maine effort is leading the way, providing a path to statewide uniformity, and providing additional tangible benefits, to multiple state and local agencies.  
However, it is also enormously challenging because the multi -affected agencies were not 
considered during LD 132 enactment or appropriation.   
A failure to fully fund the data system and the technical staff positions presented first in 
LD 132 and again in LD 1999 will not simply make it difficult to manage the onboarding to a new centralized module for the other 135 agencies, but also create a hardship for even the Department of Public Safety to meet obligations currently in statute. This potentially sends a message that the data collection required is not valued enough to be functionally funded and renders  the open stakeholder process  that led to LD 1999 as merely symbolic. Such a message 
from the Legislature will in turn make it hard for municipal officials to justify any additional effort or expenditure locally on the collection.  
To that end, MMA and municipal officials respectfully request that you fully fund the 
fiscal note attached to LD 1999 and honor that work and the intended goals for this effort in its entirety.
