MACDL strongly opposes this proposed bill. 
Over the past four years, much progress has been accomplished with the consensus of 
many stakeholders (juvenile defenders, juvenile prosecutors, civil rights champions, 
the Department of Corrections, prisoner rights advocates, judicial officers)--all of 
whom are concerned with the welfare and rights of juvenile defendants. 
There is no reason to roll back progress on a whim by enacting this legislation. The 
sole purpose of this proposal is to dismantle the work put into previous legislation and
improvements that have happened because of that prior legislation. 
Children, especially young children, should be kept out of prison. They should be 
represented. They need advocates. They need support and second chances. 
It is unclear why this bill has been brought forth. Passage of this bill would do real 
harm to the children who are caught up in the juvenile legal system. 
This Committee has done excellent work over the past two sessions to ensure that 
juvenile defendants are cared for and supported. Let's not go backwards. Our children 
deserve better.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to provide more information 
and whatever the Committee needs to make the right decision for Maine's children 
moving forward.
