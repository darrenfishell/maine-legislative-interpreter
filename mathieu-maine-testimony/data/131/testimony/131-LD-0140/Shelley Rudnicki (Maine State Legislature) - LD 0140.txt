Testimony 
In Support of 
LD 140 An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the Right to Counsel for Juveniles 
and Due Process for Juveniles 
Good Aftemoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of 
the Judiciary Committee, I am Representative Shelley Rudnicki. I represent House 
District #67, the towns of Fairﬁeld and Benton. 
I am here today to introduce LD 140 “An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the 
Right to Counsel for Juveniles and Due Process for Juveniles ”. 
This bill is simply a repeal of the LD 320 Which is now chaptered law. Rather than try to 
ﬁx the law, I think it is better to repeal it and start over. 
Often in this building when We try to ﬁx our mistakes, many times the ﬁx is Worse. 
This came to my attention in Fairﬁeld speciﬁcally, when we had issues with juveniles 
continuingly terrorizing the community. In meetings with residents, local law 
enforcement and the District Attorney, I felt that a portion of this law had tied the hands 
of the authorities ’ ability to manage the problem. That portion is Withholding 
institutional disposition in 15 MRSA §33 I3. I have attached that with my testimony. 
I do realize that there are couple of other bills coming forward around this issue and am 
Willing to work with the sponsors of those bills and am not opposed to waiting for the 
Work session until those are ready. I will leave that to your to discretion. 
Yours truly, 
Shelley Rudnicki 
State Representative 
District 67 Fairﬁeld and Benton

Part 6: MAlNE JUVENILE CODE 
Chapter 507: PETITION, ADJUDICATION AND |J|sP0s|T|oN 
§3313. Criteria for withholding an institutional disposition 
1. Standard. The court shall enter an order of disposition for a juvenile who has been adjudicated as having 
committed a juvenile crime without imposing placement in a secure institution as disposition unless, having regard 
to the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character and condition of the juvenile, it finds that the 
conﬁnement of the juvenile is necessary for protection of the public because: 
A There is undue risk that, during the period of a suspended sentence or probation, the juvenile will commit 
another crime; [PL 1979, c. 663, §118 (AMD) .1 
B. The juvenile is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most effectively by the juvenile's 
commitmenttoaninstitution; or [PL 2019, c. 525, §26 (AMD) .1 
C. A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the juvenile's conduct. [PL 1977, c. 520, §1 
(NEW) .] 
[PL 2019, c. 525, §26 (AMD).] 
2. Additional consideration. The following grounds, while not controlling the discretion of the court, must be 
accorded weight against ordering placement in a secure institution: 
A The juvenile's conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm; [PL 1977 , c. 520 , §1 (NEW) .1 
B. The juvenile did not contemplate that the juvenile's conduct would cause or threaten serious harm; [PL 
2019, 0. 525, §26 (AMD) .] 
C. The juvenile acted underastrong provocation; [PL 1977, c. 520, §1 (NEW) .1 
D. There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the juvenile's conduct, though failing to 
establishadefense; [PL 1977, c. 520, §1 (NEW) .1 
E. The victim of the juvenile's conduct induced or facilitated the commission of the conduct; [PL 2019, c. 
525, §26 (AMD) .1 
E‘ . The juvenile has made or has agreed to pay restitution to the victim of the juvenile's conduct for the damage 
or injury that the victim sustained in an amount that the court has determined is within the juvenile's ability to 
pay pursuant to section 3314-C (../15/title15sec3314-C.html)_; { PL 2021 , c. 326, §6 (RPR) .3 
G. The juvenile has not previously been adjudicated to have committed a juvenile crime or has led a law- 
abiding life fora substantial period of time prior to the conduct that formed the basis for the present 
adjudication; [PL 2019, C. 525, §2s (AMD) .1

1/26/23, 12:01 PM Title 15, §3313: Criteria for withholding an institutional disposition 
H. The juvenile's conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur; [PL 1977, c. 520, §1 
(NEW) .] 
l. The character and attitudes of the juvenile indicate that the juvenile is unlikely to commit another juvenile 
crime; [PL 2019, c. 525, §26 (AMD) .1 
J. The juvenile is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probation; [PL 2021, <1. 326, §7 (AMD) .1 
K. The confinement of the juvenile would entail excessive hardship to the juvenile or the juveniles dependents; 
[PL 2021, c. 326, §8 (AMD) .] 
L. The juvenile had not attained 14 years of age at the time of the alleged conduct; and [PL 2021 , c. 326, 
§9 (NEW) .1 
M. The juvenile crime would be considered a Class D or Class E crime if committed by an adult and, based upon 
both the written agreement of the parties and a court finding, the facts and circumstances of the underlying 
juvenile criminal episode giving rise to the adjudication did not generate probable cause to believe the juvenile 
had committed what would be considered a Class A, Class B or Class C crime if committed by an adult. [PL 
2021, c. 326, §10 (NEW) .1 
[PL 2021, c. 326, §§6—1O (All/lD).] 
3. Statement of reasons accompanying disposition for juvenile adjudicated of murder or a Class A, ClassB 
or Class C crime. In a disposition for a juvenile crime that if committed by an adult would be murder or a Class A, 
Class B or Class C crime, the court shall state on the record and in open court the court's reasons for ordering or not 
ordering placement of the juvenile in a secure institution.
