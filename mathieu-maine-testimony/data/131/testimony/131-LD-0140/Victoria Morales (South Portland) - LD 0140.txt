Testimony in Opposition to LD 140 
___________________________________________________________________________
Dear Senator Carney , Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary 
Committee.  I submit this testimony in opposition to LD 140.  My apologies for not being able
to be here in person.
As you may know , in the 130th Legislature I sponsored LD 320, An Act To Provide the Right 
To Counsel for Juveniles and Improve Due Process for  Juveniles, which is now law . This law 
is the culmination of several years of work, and is a reprise of a bill I sponsored in the 129th
session, LD 1684. It arose from the collective expertise and wisdom of providers and
advocates and young people with lived experience. It is based on a solid foundation of
conclusive  research on child development, best practices, and the legal principles of fairness
and access to justice.

I believe that legislation is best when it is debated and negotiated by people with varying
viewpoints, and so from early 2019 through 2021, I worked closely with stakeholders to do just
that. I greatly appreciate the work of Dr . Landry and his team at the Department of Health and 
Human  Services, Commissioner Liberty and his team at the Department of Corrections,
prosecutors, defense attorneys, young people with lived experience with the justice system, child
development specialists, the Judicial branch, the Governor ’s Office, this Committee, and others. 
We had many robust discussions and the final language, which is now law , was amended to 
reflect the feedback I received.
The underpinnings of this new law are grounded in public safety and scientific research about
adolescent development. When young people are in crisis and act in ways that harm themselves 
and others, providing them with the tools and support they need to keep them connected to their
families, schools and communities reduces their risk of reof fending, being pushed out of the 
education system, and entering into the adult justice system. And of course, when young people 
do not reof fend, this makes our communities safer .

It is also supported by several recommendations made
in the 2019 Children’ s Center on Law 
and Policy (CCLP) Report, after CCLP  spent a year in Maine studying our systems and engaging 
with stakeholders.

aligned with research in law , policy , and practice” and “Create a process for regular judicial 
review of commitments and out-of-home placements”), available at

LD 320 implements 3 main changes to Maine’ s juvenile code:
1)
Ensures that children under 12 cannot be committed (sentenced) to Long Creek Youth
Development Center (LCYDC), and that if a child under 12 is detained at LCYDC
immediately following a crisis, that detention can be no longer than 7 days.
2)
Ensures that all who are committed to LCYDC have a right to counsel and judicial review
of their commitment. Because the Maine Juvenile Code includes an ongoing requirement
that young people be provided with the least restrictive placement and the most
appropriate treatment, the rights to judicial review with counsel are critical to respond to
the rapid pace at which adolescents develop and the availability of community
treatment/service opportunities that may not have existed when judgment was ordered.
3)
Removes the 1 year mandatory minimum sentence of every young person to LCYDC
regardless of the of fense, while maintaining a judge’ s discretion to sentence a young 
person to an indeterminate sentence until age 21.
To arrive where we are today in the implementation process of LD 320 has taken a tremendous
amount of time and resources, including many many iterations of policy ideas to meet the
universal goal of improving public safety and improving the lives of our most at-risk young
people in Maine. I couldn’ t be prouder of this work on behalf of the young people in Maine as it 
is the sole reason I ran for of fice in 2018.
The fact of the matter is that there will always be young people in crisis. However , I truly believe
that the framework this Committee has developed in LD 320 sets the stage for great
improvements in how we respond to these crises and how we ensure that young people and their
families receive the appropriate support and services they need to prevent further crises and
community harm.
For these reasons, I respectfully request that you vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 140.
