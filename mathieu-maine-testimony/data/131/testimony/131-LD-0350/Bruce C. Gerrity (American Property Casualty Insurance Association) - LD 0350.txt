RE: LD 350 — An Act to Prevent Dog Breed Discrimination by Insurance Companies 
Dear Senator Bailey and Representative Perry, 
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA) submits these comments in 
opposition to LD 350. APCIA is an association of property casualty insurers with more than 1,200 
members from across the United States, including Maine. APCIA companies write more than 60% of 
the property casualty insurance market in Maine, including homeowner ’s insurance. 
APCIA must start by asking a key question — what problem are we trying to solve? What is the 
important public policy advanced by LD 350? Regardless of the lens one peers through there is no' 
problem that justiﬁes requiring every carrier to march in lockstep. What is the public policy at issue? 
Competition in the MarketplaceA 
i 
There are well over 300 companies, both regional and national, that write homeowner ’s 
insurance in Maine. Maine’s rates are among the lowest in the nation because of that competition. As 
a matter of public policy we applaud it when the industry competes on the basis of service, coverage, 
ease of access, degree of specialization, types of coverage, and many other factors. Why? It keeps 
rates lower. It improves service. Every time a mandate is imposed, however, competition is reduced. 
There is no reason to stiﬂe competition on the grounds that companies do not compete with respect to 
underwriting dogs. Some will cover any dog and some will not. A number of companies have long 
covered dogs regardless of breed. They include State Farm Insurance, USAA Insurance, Chubb 
Insurance, Toggle Insurance (a F armer’s company), and Amica, for example. In short, dog owners can 
go to any of these companies, or others, and get insurance.- 
Access to Insurance 
. Maine’s insurance producers are available in virtually every town in Maine and online. These 
producers each work with a number of carriers and match insured’s needs with the right carrier. Other 
carriers have online programs. There is no issue with ready availability, affordability and coverage 
options.

Underwriting 
Companies underwrite on a variety of bases. Decisions are driven by data and analysis. With 
regard to dogs, there are a number of factors in play. There are about 4.5 million reported dog bites 
that occur each year in the United States. .More than one-third of all homeowner liability claims paid 
in 2021 were the result of interactions with dogs. Liability claims in 2021 totaled $882 million, an 
increase of 44% in the last decade and 172% since 2003. There were 17,989 dog bite claims 
nationwidein 2021, with an average cost payout of $49,025. These bites include nips by a Chihuahua, 
fatal maulings, and everything in between. The extraordinary severity of the claims cost statistics is 
driven by maulings, notably lead by pit bull and pit bull mixes. Some carriers will not want to be in 
that market. Others will.r 
The Nature of Attacks 
LD 350 goes so far as to prohibit an insurer to underwrite — not only would it mandate that 
every carrier cover every dog at the outset, it prohibits an insurer from pricing the coverage. That 
means, the entire insured population for that carrier have to bear the additional cost. That is not fair 
and not good public policy.»
» 
One of the key factors to be considered is the nature and destructiveness of attacks inﬂicted by 
some dogs. In 2009 the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology noted “A human dog 
bite related fatality generally refers to death proximately caused by trauma from a dog’s teeth and 
jaws” and further stated, “Pit bull type dogs, Rottweilers and German Shepherds constitute the 
majority of canines implicated in these fatalities. ” (@§t_31g;b;l;i_ €3~1"Cir§t§_§__§l~ii1iHi,i§iqg ﬂﬁ 15-=vear1'eview,gf 
iggntaueiay medical examiner C2i$€§_j_lititi31i§yji_§j{i_ §;ij_i;1,,ggg}§).) 
A study published in the Annals of Surgery in 201 1 stated, “Attacks by pit bulls are associated 
with higher morbidity rates, higher hospital charges, and a higher risk of death than are attacks by 
other breeds of dogs.” (iVlOI'i21i1t§¢l,__1EiUlil1gL§_l1{i_@i£ll1 ‘Q§g1Jg_iQ_ ‘y1§ji§iQtt§_§@_}:_ 1§— Pubivicd tnihxgovj.) 
The Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2013 similarly concluded, “Dog bites from larger breeds 
that bite and hold the upper extremity are associated with major vascular trauma.” (i\/lanage1n<g;3t__o_f 
yas_o_t_il_a§ ;t_raumafro1n_dog,_bi§es » SQ-l_efllQ§_3_l;)__l __l;t§_(_§[.) A study published in the International Journal of 
Surgery Case Reports in 2018 concluded, “Attacks by pit bull terriers are more likely to cause severe 
morbidity than other breeds of dogs. Immediate surgical exploration is required to prevent 
catastrophic outcomes, especially limb loss.” A study published by Vet World in 2020 found, “Pit 
bulls tended to bite multiple body parts more often than other breeds” and “Pit bulls have the greatest 
ﬁequency of severe injuries (49.57%). ” (A_ lQo_l_< _ ;i_t___t_li _e_iii_ici_tl<.=.r_;._@ §_i1_£_i _g;_i_sl<. i}1ctors for dog bites ___ ig1

' 
The nature of the attack, along with the size and disposition of the dog can induce major trauma. For example, 
Rottweilers weigh between 95-130 lbs.; Akitas 130 lbs.; Presa Canarios 1 10-160 lbs.; and Mastiffs up to 230 lbs. The 
attacks of these dogs cause massive damage.

In one instance, 71-year old Connie Veilleux was raking leaves in her yard. She was attacked 
and mauled by a dog — in that instance a pit bull — and almost lost both arms and was in the hospital for 
three months. 
Wikipedia reported a list of fatalities in the years 2020-2023. (Attached) In some instances the 
dog had had a history of prior aggression. In many there was never a history of aggressive behavior. 
History 
This is not the ﬁrst time this issue has come before the Maine Legislature. For example, most 
recently in the 122"‘! Legislature the Committee on Insurance and Financial Services heard LD5 _43, An 
Act to Prohibit an Insurerﬁvm Cancelling an Insurance Policy Due to Ownership of Certain Breeds. 
The bill came out of committee with an 11 to 2 Ought Not to Pass report and was killed. 
There are no bad dogs, only bad owners. 
It has been argued that there are “no bad dogs, only bad owners.” Respectfully, that argument 
misses the point. In fact, an insurer will virtually never know whether a dog is a “bad dog” or hasa 
“bad owner” until aﬁer the mauling. In addition, what is a “bad owner”? Who makes that judgment 
and on what basis? Is it an owner that only lets the dog out two times a day instead of four or ﬁve? Is 
it an owner that does not give what someone might consider to be a great deal of love or affection to 
the dog but another person might? Is it a dog that has been trained to guard or protect? Those are all 
things that an insurer cannot possibly know in advance and use as a basis for an underwriting decision. 
~ 
In short, there are many reasons why a carrier might choose to exclude coverage for a dog. 
There is a robust market in the industry. Availability and affordability are not in issue. Removing 
underwriting will increase costs overall. There is no signiﬁcant public policy involved. 
For the above reasons, APCIA respectfully asks the Committee to give this bill a unanimous 
Ought Not to Pass vote._ 
Respectfully submitted,
