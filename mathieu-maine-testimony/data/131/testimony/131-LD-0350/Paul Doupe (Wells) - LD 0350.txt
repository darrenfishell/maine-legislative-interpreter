Subject: Support for LD 350 preventing dog breed discrimination" 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
Dear Members. 
I Want to offer my support for the following bill ,Support for LD 350 preventing dOg breed 
discrimination" . I support this bill because I believe Insurance companies have no right to discrimnate 
against their policy holders decision to have a particular breed of dog as a family member. I 
especially oppose Insurance Companies charging their policy holders additional money on their policy 
to insure particular breed of dog, as it is the pet equivalent of price gouging.
