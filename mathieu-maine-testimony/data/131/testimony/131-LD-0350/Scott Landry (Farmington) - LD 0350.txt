Testimony of Rep. Scott Landry in opposition to  
LD 350, An Act to Prevent Dog Breed Discrimination by Insurance 
Companies  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance  and Financial Services  
 
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry  and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services Committee, I am Representative Scott Landry. I serve House District 75, 
which includes the towns of Chesterville and Farmington . Thank you for the opportunity to share 
my opposition to  LD 350, An Act to Prevent Dog Breed Discrimination by Insurance 
Companies . 
 
I spent my career in the insurance business. I started in the field in 1983, established Shiretown 
Insurance in Farmington in 1995 and retired in 2015. During more than 30  years in the industry, 
I saw a lot of  incidents involving dogs, such as personal injuries , deaths and  property destruction. 
My obser vation is that certain breeds a re more commo nly involved  in those incid ents, and that is 
why certain companies have restrictions around what types of dogs a homeowner can own if they 
are going to be covered by a policy.  
 
While these types of restrictions do exist, there  are several companies that will write policies for 
home owners with any breed of dog  in Maine , so folks do have options when obtaining coverage.  
Restricting the ability of insurance companies to properly underwrite and rate a risk will 
ultimately result in limiting the company options and premiums rates for ho meowners.  With this 
in mind, I believe it should be left to the company whether they will write policies for 
homeowners who own certain breeds.  
 
Thank you for your consideration. Please feel welcome to contact me with any questions I can 
help answer.
