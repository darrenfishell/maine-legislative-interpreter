Re: An Act to Add Political Affiliation as a Protected C/ass to the Maine Human Rights Act - LD 1663 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
The Maine Human Rights Commission ("Commission") is Maine's quasi-independent, neutral, apolitical State 
agency charged with enforcing our state anti~discrimination law, theMaine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S. §§ 4551, et seq. 
(”MHRA"). The Commission is statutorily charged with the duties of: investigating, conciliating, and at times litigating 
protected~class discrimination cases under the MHRA; promulgating rules and regulations to effectuate the Act; and 
making recommendations for further legislation or executive action concerning infringements on human rights in 
Maine. 5 M.R.S. § 4566(7), (11). With those duties in mind, the Commission is pleased to provide this testimony 
neither for nor against LD 1663. 
As the MHRA was intended to address adverse treatment based on a person's innate characteristics (things one 
does not choose about one’s self), "political affiliation" might be an outlier within the MHRA framework. The proposed 
Section 3 deﬁnition of who would be a member of the protected class is exceedingly broad; ”political affiliation" would 
”mean belonging to or endorsing a party or a particular political philosophy, creed or ideal." Adopting this definition 
would provide MHRA protected-class status to anyone who endorsed any political idea. Given what would be LD 1663's 
wide scope of coverage, the Commission anticipates that it would receive significant numbers of complaints related to 
political affiliation; the Commission's fiscal note reflects this foreseeable impact on the agency's operations. 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony about LD 1663. The Commission would be pleased to 
discuss these issues with you at your convenience, including at the work session on this matter. 
Sincerely, 
M Vii _%vu¢Lr.s¢»v\_.
