Testimony in Support of LD 533
An Act to Exempt Overtime Pay from Individual Income Tax 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Taxation:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am writing this testimony in support of LD 533, “An Act to 
Exempt Overtime Pay from Individual Income Tax.”
It is no secret that we are in a time of economic hardship. Between the rising price of groceries
and gasoline, under the burden of inflation that gnaws on savings accounts and stretches paychecks 
thin, the working people of the State of Maine are forced to exercise and exert their resourcefulness 
to their limits. Many have to take on overtime to make ends meet, and many businesses must resort 
to straining their diminished personnel in order to fill roles left empty due to our state’s chronic deficit 
in workforce participation.
I personally have seen many commendable efforts to make do with what is available. Yet I 
believe more help can be given, and I see LD 533 as a confident stride in that direction. For those 
working extra hours, letting them take home more of their paycheck by freeing it from income tax is 
an incredible benison,  better than any handout. Giving employers more to work with when 
compensating their employees for going above and beyond will assuredly help make Maine businesses
more attractive places to work.
In these difficult times, I want to see my fellow citizens rewarded for doing what’s right: 
stepping up and providing for their families. I hope the need to give our neighbors a break is evident, 
and I hope this much needed blessing that tax-free overtime is will be considered and approved. Let 
wage earners take home more of their pay, and thereby ease some of the burden of long days and 
light pocketbooks.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
