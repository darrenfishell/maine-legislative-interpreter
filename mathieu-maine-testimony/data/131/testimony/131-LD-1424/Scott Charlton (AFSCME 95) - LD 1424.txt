I currently am an employee with MDOC and have 15 years of service to the state. 
currently due to the age requirements I will have to complete 29 years of service to 
reach age for retirement. I am lucky in that I never joined state service until I was 26 
years old. however, now you have employees joining the ranks of service directly out 
of High School. an 18 year old starting in a career that as of now requires them to 
serve 37 years. albeit the state loses in this if they make it through those 37 years the 
state has to pay out 74% of their highest 3 years of service within 10% of their 4th 
highest year. they will make out. my problem is with the age requirement is the life 
expectancy of a correction officer according to NIC national Institute of Corrections 
for a study in Florida that the average life expectancy of a corrections officer is 
62.4years, as opposed to the national avearge of 74.2 years of age (study is from 
2011). to retire someone at age 55, to only have an average lifespan after retirement of
4-5 years is deplorable. for the sakes of those hiring out of high school, please 
consider this bill. thank you.
