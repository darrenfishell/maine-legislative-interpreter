SUBJECT: Testimony on L.D. 1424 - An Act to Remove the Age Requirement for 
Correctional Staff Retirement under the 1998 Special Plan 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the ]oint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing. My name is Kathy Morin, and I am the Director of Actuarial and 
Legislative Affairs for the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. 
MainePERS is neither for nor against L.D. 1424. We are here to provide information and offer 
any assistance the Committee might need regarding this bill. 
State employees are covered by either a "regular plan” or a "special plan." The majority of 
state employees are covered by the regular plan, which permits retirement after twenty-five 
years of service and/ or attainment of normal retirement age of 60, 62 or 65. Special plans 
typically allow for retirement with fewer years of service and / or at a younger age. Because of 
the more favorable provisions of the special plans, they are more expensive to fund. Included 
with this testimony is a chart that details the different plans and the groups covered by each. 
L.D. 1424 proposes to change the retirement plan by which certain Department of Corrections 
and Department of Administrative and Financial Services employees are covered. Employees 
in the positions described in the bill are currently covered by the 1998 Special Plan. It is our 
understanding that the intent of L.D. 1424 is to move all covered employees into a special plan 
that provides for retirement after completing 25 years of service, regardless of age. This would 
be a plan separate from the 1998 Special Plan. 
This bill would have a fiscal impact because the Constitution does not allow the creation of 
new or additional benefits unless immediately and fully funded. New benefits would be 
created if covered employees are able to retire earlier and with a higher benefit, which would 
result in benefits in excess of those currently accounted for and funded, creating a new 
unfunded actuarial liability (UAL). A more favorable plan would also have higher ongoing 
employer normal costs.

We have not yet estimated the costs associated with L.D. 1424. With guidance from the 
Committee, we will work with the departments and the Office of Fiscal and Program Review 
to identify the individuals covered by this proposal and to determine the costs associated with 
changing the retirement plan coverage for this group of employees. 
On a technical note, if we are correct in our understanding of the intent of the bill, we do not 
think the bill as drafted accomplishes that intent. Specifically, the bill is drafted to amend 
qualifications for benefits under the 1998 Special Plan for only these employees. It does not 
address other aspects, such as the calculation of benefits. Many other groups are covered by 
the 1998 Special Plan and changing eligibility requirements for one group within that plan 
may create confusion. An alternative approach is to remove this group from that plan and 
place them in the existing 25 year, no age requirement plan. That approach would be 
consistent with that taken when other groups have been removed from the 1998 Special Plan 
and placed in a more favorable plan. We are happy to work with the sponsor and the 
Committee's Analyst on language to accomplish that intent. 
We would also note that L.D. 483, for which a public hearing was held on March 2, proposes 
to change plan coverage for a subset of employees covered by L.D. 1424. Under that bill, the 
covered individuals would remain in the 1998 Special Plan and be provided with retroactive 
coverage in that plan. 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony. I would be happy to answer your 
questions and will be available at your work session.
