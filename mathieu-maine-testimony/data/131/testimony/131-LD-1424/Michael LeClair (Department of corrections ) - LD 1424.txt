Michael LeClair
Department of corrections 
LD 1424
Hello and thank you for reading, I’m a correctional officer at the maine state prison 
and have been for over a decade. Over the years the one thing that stands out is 
retention of staff or lack of in this case. We compete with many jobs in the state along
with other facilities such as county jails whom may pay more, and other departments 
like the state police, boarder patrol, local police and many other agencies. Since I’ve 
been here they have lowered the standards to hire just about anyone that’ll apply, now
not just hiring straight out of high school but actively recruiting at high schools. This 
can be found on the departments website. These are and have been all out of 
desperation to fill positions for a job that few are willing to do. With the passing of 
LD1424 my do a couple things it will give people hope for a future in the current job 
and possibly be a motivator for others to swap from their department over to ours, the 
opposite of what I’ve seen over the years. Thank you
