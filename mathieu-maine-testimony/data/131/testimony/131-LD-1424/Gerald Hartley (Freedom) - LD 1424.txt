My Name is Gerald Hartley, I have worked for the Maine State Prison Since January 
of 1995 starting at the age of 23. I have held many different roles in my career, 
working with the Dog Team to track and search escaped prisoners, lost children and 
elderly, working in units and doing transports. In this time, I have been mandated to 
work over my 12 hour shifts many times, more than I can say is feasible and healthy 
and I have seen others in this same situation.   This has been difficult for my family as
well as other correctional officers. Having to work mandates while myself and my 
coworkers missed our childrenâ€™s games and additional school functions have been 
difficult over the years. 
Getting few and far between raises over the years and then having a retirement 30 
years away is not beneficial for the correctional department or for the officers being 
hired. 
Having a retirement plan in place that helps retain staff and recruits additional new 
officers into this career will benefit the life of staff and residents alike 
Thank you 
Gerald Hartley
