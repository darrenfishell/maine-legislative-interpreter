Good Morning and thank you for giving us an opportunity to provide testimony 
today. My name is Jeremy Roberts, I work as a Correctional Trades Instructor at 
Bolduc Correctional Facility. I started at Maine State Prison in 2010. I was an FTO 
training new staff for 3 years and have been an AFSCME union rep for 5 years. I am 
providing testimony on my own behalf and do not speak for the MDOC.
In today's world where it's financially adventurous to change jobs every 3 to 5 years 
to get a 10 to 20% increase in pay. Where your employer is only going to offer you a 
2 to 4% increase in yearly compensation. A retirement plan that's 30plus years away 
no longer carries any weight in retaining employees. Add to the fact that Officers are 
starting on step 3 of 8 to help make the starting pay competitive with surrounding 
county jails. Now employees top out in 5 years and only get pay increases through 
contractual cost of living adjustments. A straight 25 year retirement would retain 
staff, especially younger staff that otherwise are looking at 30 to 37 years till 
retirement eligibility. 
A direct example was a Correctional officer class in 2022. A class of 4 was on their 
final weeks of on job training when it was explained to them the retirement was both 
25yrs and age 55. 2 of the 4 where 18 and 19. They got the retirement plan clarified 
through HR. Looking at 36 and 37 years till retirement, they both quit on the spot. 
Thousands of dollars on training spent and gone. 
Removing the age for retirement is one of a few steps we hope the state considers to 
retain and recruit employees to fill critical vacancies within your Correctional 
facilities around the state. 
Thank you for your time
Jeremy Roberts
