I support of Id 1585 with grandfather clause for existing 
Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee, good morning and thank you for hosting this hearing. 
l am in support of id 1585 canopy cap WITH grandfather clause for existing facilities. How many 
businesses exceed these limitations â€™? I do believe that canopy caps are an effective and fair 
method to provide the market protection from oligopoly domination by a few big players. 
In order to avoid the threat and expense of litigation, we should grandfather existing businesses 
with canopy caps that exceed these proposed limitations as owners made significantly costly 
business decisions based upon canopy size. A clause allowing these business to exist at that 
canopy maximum until and if any change of ownership may avpid expensive litigation. 
Sincerely, 
Scotty Ouellette
