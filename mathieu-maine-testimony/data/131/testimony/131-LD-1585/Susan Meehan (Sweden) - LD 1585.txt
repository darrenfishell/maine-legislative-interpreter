in support of Id 1585 canopy cap WITH grandfather clause for existing facilities. 
Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee, good morning and thank you for hosting this hearing. 
I believe i am basically in favor of this bill; however, it would be interesting to know how many 
canopies in medical and separately in adult use exceed these proposed canopy caps. I do 
believe that canopy caps are an effective and fair method to provide the market protection from 
oligopoly domination by a few big players. 
ln order to avoid the threat and expense of litigation, it may be prudent to grandfather existing 
businesses with canopy caps that exceed these proposed limitations. It may be fair to allow 
existing businesses that have made financial decisions based upon different limitations a clause 
to exist at that canopy maximum until and if any change of ownership. 
Thank-you for hosting this hearing.
