TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITI ON TO  
 
L.D. 957 
 
AN ACT REQUIRING WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS IN NEW  
AND RENOVATED PUBLIC SCHOOLS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  I 
am Victoria Wallack, dir ector of communications and government relations for Maine School Management 
Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and 
Maine School Superintendents Association , in opposition to  L.D. 957. 
 
Our associations oppose this bill . While we think the intent is positive, it is unnecessary . In many locations, 
these water bottles filling stations are already being installed using local dollars and grants received for this 
purpose. We donâ€™t believe these are the kind of mandates the sta te should put on school construction or 
renovation.  
 
New school and substantial school renovation projects are financed through local taxpayer dollars, state 
funding, or a combination of both. There are rules around that con struction  that focus on school  safety  and the 
creation of good learning spaces . 
 
As long as the fountain s are safe to use, w e feel it is an overreach to dictate the kind of water fountains that 
should be installed  within a renovation or during new construc tion. That decision should be pa rt of the 
decision -making process within the building design process.
