CORRECTED VERSION 
TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO 
L.D. 957 
AN ACT REQUIRING WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATIONS IN NEW 
AND RENOVATED PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in opposition to L.D. 957. 
Our associations understand that there are many pros to installing water bottle ﬁlling station but oppose the 
bill as this would be another unfunded mandate. The average cost of purchasing a ﬁlling station for schools is 
$1,500. 
New school and substantial school renovation projects are ﬁnanced through local taxpayer dollars, state 
funding, or a combination of both. There are rules around construction that focus on school safety and the 
creation of healthy learning spaces. Building committees come together to make decisions about every aspect 
of the new project. The decision to install water ﬁlling stations should be left to the decision-making process 
within the building design process.
