Karen Thomas and committee, My name is Crystal Martell from Sanford, Maine. I have been resident of Maine 
for 46 years. I have special needs and can not access medical facilities or providers because I can not access or 
not eligible for Maine Care. Why‘? Why does Maine Care cut off funding to its own Maine citizens but Want to 
expand funding for non citizens? This unfair. Maine should take care of its own citizens ﬁrst before helping 
non American citizens. Due to the long waiting list and loss of doctors since 2020 how can Maine support more 
people coming into the state. Maine needs to ﬁx the health crisis of lack of doctors ﬁrst and take care of its own 
citizens who has lived here for many years. Please vote NOT to pass on LD199.
