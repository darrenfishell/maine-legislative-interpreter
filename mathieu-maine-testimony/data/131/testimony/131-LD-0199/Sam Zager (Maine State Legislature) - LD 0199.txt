Testimony in Support of 
LD 199, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents 
by Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program 
March 28, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable fellow members of the 
Health and Human Services Committee. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill, 
and I thank Speaker Talbot Ross for her leadership and for introducing it. There are 
many human faces of this bill for me; countless times seen what access (or lack of 
access) to healthcare means for real people. I’ll let others tell their stories better 
than I could. Please allow me to offer a couple things to consider. 
l. Health insurance saves lives. That’s not hypothetical; it’s been OlI)S61'V €Cl andI 
measured in the real world.‘ An additional life is saves for every 500 or so people 
who have health insurance. That’s more effective as a life-saver than 
mammograms for breast cancer, or colonoscopies for colon cancer screening? 
Let’s not lose sight of the life-saving power of health insurance. Even as we 
consider these numbers, we know we’re talking about real people.A 
2. Health insurance improves lives. Again, that’s been quantiﬁed with measurable 
outcomes. For instance, control of chronic conditions can be measured in visits to 
the Emergency Room. A leading Emergency Medicine journal published an 
important research paper that found, that ER visits for psychiatric concerns 
1 
The range of this ratio in the medical literature is one life saved per 239-830 additional people with health insurance. See

May 2014, 160(9): 585-593. https://www.acpjoumals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/m13-2275 . See also Sommers, State Medicaid

dropped as the number of uninsured individuals decreased.3 This is a meaningful 
outcome, especially here in Maine. But it’s also true for non—psychiatric chronic 
conditions. One paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine pointed 
out that health insurance leads to problems being diagnosed at an earlier stage.4 
The authors highlighted the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. When that 
condition is found early, treatment revolves around exercise, dietary measures, and 
perhaps oral medications. If found later, injected insulin comes into play. And at 
late stages, there’s a need for signiﬁcantly life-impacting interventions like 
amputations and dialysis. 
Health insurance removes barriers to chronic disease management, and reduces 
people’s reluctance to get care. All this helps people be healthier--and healthier 
people contribute to healthier families, more productive workplaces, and more 
vibrant, prosperous communities.5=6 
Let’s keep our hearts open to the good that LD l99 would bring. 
Thank you for your attention. I ’d be happy to answer any questions.
