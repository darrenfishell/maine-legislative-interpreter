“ An

I
speak
as
someone
who
has
beneﬁted
personally
fr om
expanded
MaineCar e
co v er age.
Befor e
I
qualiﬁed
for
MaineCar e
I
was
either
uninsur ed
or
co v er ed

that
made
it
pr ohibitiv ely
expensiv e
t o

This
all
changed
after
Maine
v oters
appr o v ed
an
expansion
of
MaineCar e
co v er age
t o
mor e
people
(including
myself ),
a
change
which
was
ﬁnally
implemented
in
2019.
Since
enr olling
in
MaineCar e,
I
ha v e
been
able
t o
addr ess
se v er al
chr onic
physical
issues
that
gr eatly
limited
my
ability
t o
work
and
contribute
t o
society .
I
am
now
able
t o
do
mor e
than
I
ha v e
in
many

which
is
a
dir ect
r esult
of
the

that
I
am
able

I
want
all
my
friends
and
neighbors
--
including
those
who
ar e
immigr ants
--
t o
ha v e
this
same
oppor tunity .
W e
all
pa y

and
we
should
all
be

t o
beneﬁt
fr om
the

Ensuring
that
all
income-qualifying
Mainers
can
access
MaineCar e
will
allow
others
in
similar

t o
my
own
t o
access

help
them

their

potential.
