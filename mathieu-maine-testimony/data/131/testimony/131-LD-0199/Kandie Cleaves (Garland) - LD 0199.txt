Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and 
Honorable Members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee. 
My name is Kandie Cleaves, and I reside in Garland. I am here 
to testify in favor of, LD 199 â€œAn Act to Improve the 
Health of Maine Residents by Removing 
Exclusions to the MaineCare Program" 
I've testified in the past on multiple bills that would 
provide access to health care and dental care, yet 
here we are again. Qther than what I believe 
should be the obvious reason, that everyone 
deserves the right to access health care, it always 
comes down to money. Including asking how can 
we afford to do this? As a taxpayer my question to 
you, is how can we afford not to? When a person 
goes without basic health care, they are more 
likely to not be seen until things become 
significantly worse and more costly. When they do 
go it is often the Emergency Room, they land in. If 
you can't afford to pay your hospital bill, that cost 
gets rolled over elsewhere. Who pays in the long 
run? We all do. If we provided the needed 
healthcare, it would be a more cost efficient way to 
spend our tax dollars. Healthy people do betterin
the workforce, their homes, and their 
communities. Our Immigrant community already 
contributes well over $190 million to state and 
local taxes, imagine if everyone had access to 
proper healthcare, if we helped them to thrive, 
how many more ways their contributions would 
grow. 
In closing I ask again that you please vote in favor 
of LD199. 
Sincerely, 
Kandie Cleaves 
Garland
