Rep. Meyer, Sen. Baldacci, and other members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services: 
Greetings from Auburn, where I'm writing to say I need you to vote Ought To Pass on
LD 199.
Two words for you: racial equity. That's what we'll gain a little bit more of when you 
pass LD 199. MaineCare MUST cover EVERYONE with low incomes. My 
neighbor's immigration status must have NO bearing on whether or not they can 
access essential, affordable healthcare.
Three words for you: All Means All. Sound familiar? Excluding Maine people from 
MaineCare is wrong, it's unjust, it's not fair and if those aren't enough reasons to get 
rid of exceptions, then consider how it's financially foolish not to support people who 
can play important roles in our workforce. 
I thought you/we were going to solve this problem last year, but I was wrong. So I 
want you to support LD 199. Please finish the job so we ALL can move forward --- 
healthy and strong --- to make Maine a better place to live, work, and raise our 
families, by having a strong healthcare system that works for ALL of us.
