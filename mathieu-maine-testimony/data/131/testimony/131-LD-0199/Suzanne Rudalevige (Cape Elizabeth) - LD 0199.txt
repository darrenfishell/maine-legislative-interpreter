Testimony for the 131st Session of the Maine State Legislature
Joint Committee on Health and Human Services
Public Hearing March 28, 2013
 LD 199:  An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing 
Exclusions to the MaineCare Program  
Ought to Pass
Chairpersons Senator Joseph Baldacci and Representative Michele Meyer and 
Members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I am retired and 
living in Cape Elizabeth .I urge you to vote in favor of this bill.
I believe that over the last several years most people in Maine have come to realize 
that we critically need an influx of workers in our state and that immigrants from 
overseas are filling that gap for us. It is therefore in our self interest to treat them 
well so that they remain living and working in Maine. It also saves money since 
without a healthcare program, people end up the vastly more expensive ER for 
what might have been treated by an office visit in a timely manner. 
From my Christian based view, it is also proper to make sure that everyone 
regardless of status has access to healthcare when they are not able financially to 
afford other insurance. 
 Our immigrants cannot be held responsible for a lack of status when the federal 
immigration system on which they rely for obtaining that status is so unresponsive 
as to be fairly described as broken. I have worked with many immigrants and know 
that many have been here 10 years and more and still await an immigration ruling. 
Meanwhile they are working in all sectors of employment and paying taxes and 
going to school. With housing the price it is,  having a job does not translate into 
being able to afford health insurance as well. (They are also having to pay for their 
work permitsâ€¦ rather outrageous!)
I very much hope that you will vote to remove the exclusions to the MaineCare 
program so that ALL can have health coverage in Maine. 
Thank you.
