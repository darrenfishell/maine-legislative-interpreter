To Members of the Health and Human Services Committee:
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Maine MultiCultural Center in regards to 
LD 199 -  An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the 
MaineCare program.  
The Maine Multicultural Center is a community-driven group representing Bangor-area 
business, cultural, and educational organizations. We promote community enrichment and 
economic growth by attracting, retaining, supporting, and integrating people of diverse cultures 
and backgrounds into greater Bangor.
Since Fall 2016, we have provided welcoming services for New Mainers, while celebrating and 
promoting the racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity that already exists in the region.  Immigrants 
play a vital role in helping business and industry in our are to meet their workforce needs.  In 
2019, the 26,763 immigrants in Maineâ€™s workforce had a spending power of $1.2 Billion.  They 
paid $151.9 Million in state and local taxes and $289.1 Million in Federal taxes.  Assisting 
immigrants to successfully settle in the area is an investment in our future.  Providing access to 
healthcare is an important part of that assistance. Unfortunately many immigrants in lower 
paying jobs (jobs our economy depends on) often cannot afford the healthcare they need and 
do not qualify MaineCare.  Passage of LD 199 will help to ensure that Maine has a healthy, 
stable, and reliable workforce.  
Sincerely,
Pamela M. Proulx-Curry
President, Board of Directors
Maine MultiCultural Center
