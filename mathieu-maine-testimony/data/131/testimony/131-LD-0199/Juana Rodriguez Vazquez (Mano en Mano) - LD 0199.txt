Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services:
my
name
is
Juana
Rodriguez
Vazquez,
I
live
in
Milbridge,
Maine
and
I
am
here
today
to
testify
in
favor
of
LD
199.
I
came
to
Maine
when
I
was
9
years
old
with
my
family.
Since
I
can
remember,
my
family
worked
as
seasonal
migrant
workers,
following
the
harvest
across
the
United
States,
starting
our
year
in
Florida,
and
ending
the
one
year
in
Maine.
My
family
chose
to
plant
roots
in
Milbridge
Maine,
and
I
have
lived
here
ever
since.
I
now
live
with
my
husband
and
two
children,
and
am
happy
to
call
Maine
home.
In
my
current
role
as
Executive
Director
of
Mano
en
Mano,
I
work
to
support
migrant
seasonal
workers
and
immigrants
to
thrive
in
Maine.
This
bill
represents
an
opportunity
to
greatly
improve
the
lives
of
members
of
my
community.
At
Mano
en
Mano
we
support
thousands
of
seasonal
migrant
workers
and
their
families
over
the
blueberry,
potato,
broccoli,
apple
and
wreath
seasons.
We
serve
families,
just
like
mine,
that
follow
the
harvest
and
put
food
on
grocery
store
shelves,
tables,
and
plates
of
folks
across
the
country.
Migrant
workers
face
a
unique
set
of
barriers
in
our
state,
and
among
them
is
a
challenge
in
accessing
healthcare.
Often,
when
we
support
folks
with
a
healthcare
need,
we
bear
witness
to
conversations
where
difficult
questions
are
asked,
and
decisions
are
made:
●
Will
we
be
able
to
buy
enough
food
if
we
go
to
the
doctors?
●
Should
I
check
my
eyesight,
or
be
able
to
send
money
to
my
family?
●
Where
can
I
go
if
there
is
an
emergency,
and
can
I
afford
it?
Folks
that
do
not
qualify
for
MaineCare
based
on
their
status,
are
treated
as
if
they
do
not
exist.
They
are
denied
personhood,
and
dignity.
They
are
left
to
fend
for
themselves,
forgotten
and
unseen.

Migrant
farmworkers
are
an
essential
part
of
what
makes
our
economy
strong,
and
communities
vibrant-
yet
they
are
not
afforded
the
basic
right
to
healthcare.
This
is
a
problem
for
obvious
reasons;
it
is
a
matter
of
survival.
It
is
also
significant,
too,
for
our
state
as
a
whole,
because
it
prevents
us
from
realizing
our
shared
prosperity
and
humanity.
Passing
LD
199
would
mean
that:
●
Families
won't
have
to
choose
between
accessing
medical
care,
and
buying
food
●
People
in
an
emergency
situation,
don't
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
can
afford
life
saving
services
●
Immigration
status
won’t
be
a
barrier
for
folks
needing
medical
care
Importantly,
passing
this
bill
would
help
migrant
seasonal
workers
and
families
to
feel
more
welcome,
and
thrive
in
Maine.
