Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services:
I
write
to
you
on
behalf
of
the
City
of
Portland’ s
Legislative/Nominating
Committee
in
support
of
LD
199,
An
Act
to
Improve
the
Health
of
Maine
Residents
by
Removing
Exclusions
to
the
MaineCare
Program.
Asylum
seekers
are
migrants
that
have
no
protection
from
the
federal
government,
as
they
are
not
refugees.
They
have
often
traveled
for
long
periods
of
time
in
very
harsh
conditions
to
arrive
at
their
destination.
They
may
have
experienced
significant trauma
resulting
from
the
ordeal,
requiring
mental
health
services.
They
have
often
escaped
from
countries
or
areas
with
political
instability ,
and
may
not
have
received
adequate
(or
any)
health
care
in
some
time.
Types
of
treatment
essential
to
their
health
-
and,
by
association,
the
health
of
the
greater
public
-
are
vaccinations,
pregnancy
care,
and
treatment
for
parasitic
or
other
transmissible infections,
including
HIV,
tuberculosis,
and
hepatitis.
Finally ,
as
asylum
seekers
have
likely had
little
to
no
access
to
medication,
they
need
to
be
assessed
for
chronic
diseases and
given
access
to
medication
and
treatment. 
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
