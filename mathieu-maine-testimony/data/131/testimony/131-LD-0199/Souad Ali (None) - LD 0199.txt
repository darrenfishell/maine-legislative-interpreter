Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and 
honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Iâ€”Iuman Services. Iviy name is Souad, and I am a mother of two 
beautiful children born in the United States. I came to this country 
from Djibouti in 2016. I am here today to urge you to support LD I99. 
I left my country to escape fear. I\Iovv, my biggest fear as an asylum 
seeker is getting sick and not being able to afford the health 
coverage I need to receive. I can't imagine being unable to support 
my children and mother because of my health condition. I live ina 
constant stream of fear and stress about what the future may hold. 
As an asylum seeker, I am a frontline worker, a Community Health 
Worker supporting people to access health care services. I'ma 
taxpayer, yet I still face several barriers to navigating the healthcare 
system because of my current immigration status. We need support 
to thrive while we are working on standing on our own two feet and 
on being self-sufficient. As a mother, having access to affordable 
healthcare is critical for my ability to participate in the economy, 
raise healthy children, and support my community. 
Investing in Iviaine Care means investing in the future of Iviaine. It 
means giving people like me a chance to contribute to society, 
support our families, and pursue our dreams. Please support LD I99 
and ensure that all Mainers access affordable healthcare. 
Thank you.
