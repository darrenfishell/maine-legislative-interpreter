207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 199 An Act to 
Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to 
the MaineCare Program 
March 28, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee On 
Health and Human Sen/ices, I am Megan Hannah, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership, and we support LD 199 An Act 
to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the 
MaineCare Program. 
We can debate whether or not one believes health care is a right ora 
privilege, but regardless of the answer, it cannot be both and it cannot be 
just for some. All Mainers who meet income guidelines are eligible for 
MaineCare, whether they choose to enroll or not. Immigrants to Maine 
deserve the same right or privilege. 
We know that individual and family health is the result of many things, not 
only health care, but health care is certainly an important part of it. It is 
important especially for those who havejoined us in Maine seeking 
asylum from war torn, economically devastated countries after a long and 
harrowing journey. 
Young children and adults come to us undernourished, traumatized and 
needing the care MaineCare will provide, in addition to other community 
supports. Providing that care for children, as we are, is so important andI 
thank you for that change. But children have parents or other adults in 
their lives, and families thrive when children and adults thrive together. 
Traumatized adults cannot be the best parents and partners they can be 
unless and until they have help. 
Adults with chronic illness need regular care so they can, eventually, go 
to work or school; they need medicine and therapy and all the things most 
other Mainers need and have the opportunity to get. 
This step is an important one, it shows who we are and what we believe. 
The State was doing this for many years and nothing terrible happened 
as a result; in fact, the opposite. People were cared for, they got the 
medical attention they needed and they are an integral part of our 
communities today. 
LD 199 will undo a bad decision based on bad assumptions. I hope that 
most of us really do assume the best in people, and we care about our 
communities and the individuals and families in them. Supporting this bill 
is the way we show what we value most. 
Thank you for your time and attention, I am happy to answer any 
questions that I can.
