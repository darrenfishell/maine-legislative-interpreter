LD 199 ought-NOT-to pass as illegal aliens are not citizens.  They are hear as guests 
in our state not American Citizens and should not receive healcare benefits through 
the Mainecare system. What Maine should do is lower the Mandatory minimal costs 
of catastrophic health insurance to be more inline with New Hampshire. Fees can be 
less than $100/mo.
Thank you.
