My name is Adriana Mercedes, and l was born and raised mostly in Maine. The 
rest of the time we were in Mexico, in my dad’s home state of Chihuahua. I went to 
college in Vermont, but moved back to Maine the night l graduated. I consider myself to 
be a Mainer, through and through. lt’s a big part of my identity, and I've started to build 
my career here - seeking to combat inequity and increase access to resources. l was 
raised to leave things better than l found them, especially things that are important to 
me. 
lt’s important to me that the people I live and work with are healthy and cared for. 
lt’s important to me that the workers processing lobster, picking blueberries, and 
harvesting potatoes - making our exports and $10 billion tourist industry possible - are 
healthy and cared for. Immigrants contribute another $193 million in taxes every year. 
The fair thing is to remove MaineCare exclusions. 
The practical thing is to remove Mainecare exclusions. Increasing access to 
healthcare - access to preventative, primary care - reduces burdens on the healthcare 
system in the long term, for individuals and intergenerationally. Healthy parents raise 
healthy kids. Healthy kids are good learners and playmates. Preventative care reduces 
reliance on prescription and over-the-counter medicines, on emergency services, and 
on invasive procedures. 
l'm invested in my community and my home. l‘m invested in my colleagues, my 
neighbors, and my friends. All of them, regardless of their migration status. Immigrants 
have invested in Maine for centuries, and until recently these exclusions did not exist. 
It's time to hold up our end of the bargain again and eliminate unjust, illogical barriers to 
basic human rights. It's time to take care of our own.
