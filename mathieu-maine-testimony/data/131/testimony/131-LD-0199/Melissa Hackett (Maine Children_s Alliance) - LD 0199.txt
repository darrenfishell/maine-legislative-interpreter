Testimony of Melissa Hackett  
Policy Associate, Maine Children’s Alliance  
In support of LD 199, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions 
to the MaineCare Program  
March 28, 2023  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on Health and  Human 
Services. My name is Melissa Hackett and I am a policy associate with  the Maine  Children’s  
Alliance. We are a statewide non -partisan, non -profit research and advocacy organization  
whose mission is to promote sound public policies to improve the lives of Maine children,  
youth, and  families.  
I offer testimony on behalf of the Maine Children’s Alliance in support of LD 199, which will 
restore  access to health insurance for Maine residents who have had their  eligibility restricted 
due to immigration status. We all benefit and are healthier when everyone has  access to the 
health care they need, when they need it . 
As advocates for children, we can tell you that covering parents is one of the most important 
things you can do to ensure a successful future for children , and to strengthen families and our 
communities. Too ofte n when parents lose health insurance coverage, their children do, too.i  
In 2012 , the Maine Children’s Alliance released a  report  on ho w children fared following the 
rollback of MaineCare.ii In sum, 28,500 working Maine parents were cut from the program . 
While these cuts were directed at adults, our analysis shows that some children lost coverage 
too, even though their eligibility had not  changed. Even  now, there are 17,000 children in Maine 
who live with a parent who does not have health insurance coverage,iii and around 6,600 
children who are eligible, but unenrolled, in MaineCare.iv  
Policies such as this one to close gaps in coverage to  MaineCare improve the well -being of  
families and will  also help address racial disparities in health outcomes  for Maine families . 
Access to equitable care is  critical to getting every child off to a healthy start, and that starts 
with the health of a pare nt before a child is born. The 2021  Maine KIDS COUNT Data Book notes 
racial disparities in areas of maternal and child health,  including data by race  of women who 
received prenatal care. In  2019, Black women in Maine were less likely to benefit from prenat al 
care in the first trimester: 75  percent of Black women compared to  91 percent of white women 
received this important maternal health care.v  
Maine’s immigrants are part of our families, schools, and communities, and valuable 
contributors to  our economy . It does not make sense that they should be denied access to 
MaineCare that ensures these families have the same opportunities for health and well -being .  
We must recognize the very important role that health insurance coverage plays in keeping all 
Maine children  and their families healthy . As child advocates, the Maine Children’s Alliances 
urges you to close this gap in health care coverage  by supporti ng LD 199. Thank you for your 
consideration .
