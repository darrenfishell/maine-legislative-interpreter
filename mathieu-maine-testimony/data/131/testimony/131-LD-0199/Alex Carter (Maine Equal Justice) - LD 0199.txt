Testimony in Support of LD 199, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing 
Exclusions to the MaineCare Program 
March 28, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Alex Carter, I use she/her 
pronouns, and I am a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice; a nonproﬁt civil legal aid provider 
working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. I’m testifying 
in support of LD 199 and access to healthcare for all low-income Maine people-no exceptions, no 
exclusions. 
I wish we could all agree that healthcare is a fundamental human right. Unfortunately, we have 
Work to do as a society when it comes to who we include in the deﬁnition of human and who we 
deem deserving of care. I hope that listening to the many people who shared their stories today has 
moved us all a bit closer to that shared humanity. I will attempt to summarize why We believe LD 
199 is not only the moral choice but also the rational choice and to highlight points Where I think 
we already agree. 
The Problem & Solution 
We can all agree that everyone gets sick and everyone at some point in their lives needs healthcare. 
From colds to cancer, human bodies sometimes require treatment and that is a universal need. What 
is not universal is the access, affordability, and availability of that care which, in this country, is 
largely based on a person’s income, employment, geography, race, and immigration status. 
Imagine if the last time you were sick you didn’t have a primary care physician to consult, you 
didn’t have coverage for routine testing, and you didn’t have enough money to pay out-of-pocket 
for an expensive prescription medication. That is the reality for many of our friends, colleagues, and 
neighbors who are immigrants in this state. Instead, they turn to a patchwork of safety net services 
and emergency care as their only point of access to our complex healthcare system. 
While the current administration and this committee have taken bold steps to improve access to 
affordable healthcare in Maine, there are still people who are categorically excluded from those 
beneﬁts based solely on their immigration status. They include green card holders and certain
2 
victims of abuse who arrived less than ﬁve years ago, asylum seekers with pending eases, and yes, 
those who are undocumented or have an uncertain or temporary status. 
LD 199 would right that Wrong by removing exclusions to our Mai11eCare program to ensure that 
everyone with low income can access the healthcare they need—regardless of immigration status. 
Immigration & Federal Restrictions 
Immigration status and eligibility for beneﬁts are not static identities, but rather ﬂuid categories 
that shift as people move through the system and changes occur at the federal level. In the mid- 
nineties, so-called welfare reform restricted most lawfully present immigrants from receiving 
federal Medicaid for at least ﬁve years after entering the U.S.1 At that time, the Maine 
Legislature, with bipartisan support, chose to continue to cover immigrants using state funds. 
Then, in 2011, the LePage administration cut access to MaineCare for many immigrants leaving 
a gap in coverage that persists today. 
Those who fall into this coverage gap are still eligible for Emergency MaineCare which only pays 
for services to stabilize a life-threatening condition. Forcing some of our residents to rely only on 
emergency care strains our hospitals and increases the cost of healthcare for everyone. Furthermore, 
many of the people who are ineligible for full MaineCare based on their current status will become 
eligible at some point in the near future. For example, an asylum seeker who is ineligible for federal 
Medicaid while their case is pending becomes eligible once granted asylum. If we ignore their 
healthcare needs today, we will still be paying for their higher healthcare costs down the line after 
health conditions have gone undetected and untreated. 
While we can all agree that our irrmrigration system needs reform at the federal level, including 
changes to the timeline for work authorization and more pathways for lawful entry, the state can 
act now to provide healthcare to those who have chosen Maine as the place to work and raise 
their families. There are myriad reasons why people leave their country of origin including war 
and civil unrest, poverty, displacement, the impacts of climate change, and the pursuit of 
education and economic opportunity, but the primary reason most immigrants come to the U.S. 
is for employment, not healthcare? 
There is no data to suggest that expanding health beneﬁts to immigrants incentivizes migration. 
A national study from Stanford's Immigration Policy Lab showed that when certain states 
expanded healthcare coverage to immigrant children and pregnant people under CHIPRA 
(Children ’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization) it had no measurable effect on whether 
immigrants chose to move to those states.3 If healthcare were a driver of migration, states that

provide a wider scope of services to more of their immigrant populations such as Califomia, 
Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, D.C.4 would see large inﬂuxes of 
immigrants associated with those expansions, yet they have not. New immigrants choose to 
make Maine their home for the same reasons many of our families came here and stayed—safety, 
family ties, a close-knit community, and a desire to work and build a life for their children. 
Workforce & Maine’s Care Economy 
We all know that Maine has a workforce shortage, and that immigration is a central part of the 
solution. Approximately 20,000 workers have left the Maine labor force since the start of the 
pandemic and we’re expected to lose another 65,000 before 2030 due to our aging populations 
Maine’s economic future depends on attracting a new workforce to our state, and we already 
depend on immigrants to keep many of our key industries aﬂoat. 
Across the country, immigrants represent disproportionately high shares of workers in many 
essential jobs, including healthcare and direct care. Nationally, 24% of dentists, 22% of nursing 
assistants, and 38% of home health aides are immigrants.6 While only 4% of Maine’s total 
population is foreign-born,7 recent census analysis from the Maine Center on Economic Policy 
(MECEP) shows that nearly 6% of hospital workers in the state are immigrants and they make up 
5.5% of nursing home staff and 7.3% of personal care workers.8 Yet, many of the same people 
who are caring for us and our loved ones are not able to access the care they need. 
A 2020 analysis from the Migration Policy Institute showed that 13% of immigrant healthcare 
support workers nationwide lacked health insurance and for non-healthcare occupations the 
percents rose to over 20% uninsured.9 Given that many immigrants work in physically 
demanding jobs with high incidence of occupational injuries, untreated health problems can 
severely constrain workforce participation. Loss of productivity resulting from personal and 
family health problems costs U.S. employers hundreds of billions of dollars each year.” It’s time 
that we returned the care that immigrants give to us and invest in a healthy, expanded workforce. 
Cost 
VVhile there is a cost to providing health care coverage, the human and ﬁnancial cost of denying that 
coverage is far greater. Multiple studies have shown that lack of health insurance is associated with

a higher risk of death.“ In 2021, one in ﬁve uninsured adults went without necessary medical care 
because they couldn’t afford it and numerous studies show that people without insurance are less 
likely to get preventive care or services for serious chronic conditions. For Black and Latinx 
communities, it’s even more difficult to afford and access healthcare. ” 
When cost is a barrier, people often delay care until conditions become more dangerous and 
more costly to treat. Utilizing emergency rooms as a point of access is also far more expensive 
for our healthcare system and places an added burden on our already stretched hospital staff.A 
2019 analysis from UnitedHealthcare found that going to the ER for medical care that could be 
handled elsewhere costs the U.S. healthcare system an excess of $32 billion dollars a year. A trip 
to the ER is on average 12 times more expensive than being treated in a doctor’s office for those 
same ailments. ” Passing LD 199 would also result in savings for our hospitals and clinic systems 
that provide a large amount of uncompensated and free care to immigrants who are not eligible 
for MaineCare. Removing unjust exclusions to MaineCare is both the right thing to do and the 
smart ﬁnancial choice. 
Equity 
Lastly, immigrant access to healthcare is a matter of racial equity. People of color experience poorer 
health outcomes in almost all health measures and are less likely to be insured than their white 
counterpa1ts.14 A greater proportion of immigrants Who would qualify for MaineCare, but for their 
immigration status, are people of color. Although the largest number of immigrants coming to 
Maine are from Canada and primarily white,“ Maine also has stark disparities in income based on 
race. An analysis of 2019 American Community Survey data showed that Black Mainers had 
median personal incomes less than half that of white Mainers. “ This is further compounded by wait 
times for work authorization for certain immigrants who must go periods of time without generating 
any income yet remain ineligible for MaineCare. LD 199 will move us one step closer to equity, 
shared prosperity, and a healthcare system that Works for all of us. 
We are grateful to those of you Who have already taken a stand for increased healthcare access by 
voting to include LD 199 in the budget. We ask that you again vote for your values by voting Ought 
to Pass on LD 199. If we truly believe that all Mainer’s deserve better and more affordable 
healthcare, then we must include everyone who is income eligible in our MaineCare program—no 
exceptions and no exclusions.
