Maine Care should be for the benefit of legal residents as is required under the 
Federal program.  We do not need to encourage more people to come to Maine to 
receive these benefits when we canâ€™t even house or care for those who are already 
here.  We do not need to saddle Maine tax payers with these costs when they are 
struggling to meet their own medical needs.
