LD 199
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services: my name is Hilrish Bampoli, I 
live in Lewiston Maine and I am writing this to testify in favor of LD 199.
I know firsthand how expensive health care is in the United States. Because I don't 
have access to affordable health care, I have to look online for traditional practices 
and cures to avoid going to the doctor. People around me pay a lot of money for 
simple medical procedures like x-rays or visits to the doctor. This makes me even 
more sure that I will never go to a hospital unless I am brought there unconscious.
After having to pay off the bills for a small cyst surgery over the course of two years, 
my experience with the high cost of health care has left me with severe PTSD. When I
need medical help, going to the hospital is no longer the first thing that comes to 
mind.
One night, I had severe tooth pain and reached out to friends and family for help. 
Everyone suggested going to urgent care, but the thought of paying for it made me 
hesitate. I held onto the pain for as long as I could until I couldn't take it anymore and 
decided to go to urgent care. I waited in pain, hoping for the pain to go away, or for 
an alternative to coming up before actually going to the hospital. 
No one should have to suffer in pain because they cannot afford to seek medical 
attention. I urge policymakers to make Mainecare accessible to all. The high cost of 
healthcare is a significant barrier to receiving necessary medical care and should not 
be a burden that people have to bear. We need to prioritize accessible and affordable 
healthcare for everyone, regardless of income or immigration status.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration
