Hibo Omer’s Testimony 
Chairperson and honorable committee members, my name is Hibo Omer, and I am 
here to testify as an executive director of a public health organization supporting 
healthcare coverage for all. I have seen ﬁrsthand the devastating impact of the lack 
of access to healthcare on individuals and communities and the urgent need fora 
comprehensive and inclusive healthcare system. 
As an organization dedicated to promoting and advancing public health, access to 
affordable and quality healthcare is a fundamental human right. The exclusion of 
many individuals and families from the current healthcare system due to their 
socioeconomic status is a grave injustice that perpetuates health inequities and 
undermines the well-being of our society. 
In our work, we have seen the irmnense value of preventative care and early 
intervention in improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. By 
providing healthcare coverage for all, we can ensure that individuals have access to 
the care they need when they need it, rather than delaying or avoiding treatment 
due to ﬁnancial barriers. 
Furthermore, healthcare coverage for all would alleviate the burden on our 
healthcare system by reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations that 
could have been prevented through early intervention and preventive care. This 
would save not only lives but also free up resources for healthcare providers to 
focus on more pressing and complex health issues. 
I urge the committee to prioritize healthcare coverage for all as a necessary step 
towards achieving health equity and building a stronger and more resilient 
healthcare system. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
