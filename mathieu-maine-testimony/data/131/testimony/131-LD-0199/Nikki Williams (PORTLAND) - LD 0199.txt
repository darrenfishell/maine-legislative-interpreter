LD 199
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services: my name is Nikki Williams, I 
live in Portland, and I am submitting testimony in favor of LD 199.
I'm writing today because I believe that MaineCare should cover everyone with low 
income - no exceptions, no exclusions. LD 199 will make sure that our friends, 
family, and neighbors who are immigrants  can visit the doctor or fill a prescription 
when they’re sick. All Mainers - no matter where we come from - need affordable 
health care. 
Immigrants contribute to our economy in key industries and pay taxes but don’t get 
those benefits in return. We need a health care system that works for everyone for a 
stronger and healthier future.
Thank you very much for your consideration,
Nikki
