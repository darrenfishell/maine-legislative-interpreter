LD 199
My name is Sandra Katz and I live in Saco Maine. I am writing in support of LD#199, an Act 
to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare 
Program. 
I feel health insurance is crucial to the health of the state (and the country as a whole). 
People who are sick and unable to get help are generally unable to work and also potential 
pass their illness along to others. In the long run it costs more if we do not take care of 
people.
Just because someone is a recent asylum seeker (an immigrant) is no reason to exclude 
them.
Thank you for your time.
