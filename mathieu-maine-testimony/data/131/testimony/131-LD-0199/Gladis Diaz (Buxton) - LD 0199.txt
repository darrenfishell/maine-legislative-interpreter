Good afternoon everyone. My name is Gladis Diaz and I live in Buxton, ME. I am originally from 
Honduras. 
I'm here today for the purpose of imploring you members of this committee, and the Governor 
and legislators to support us to get this bill passed so we can have MaineCare. We low-income 
people cannot afford health insurance and it is very difficult for us to live and work without the 
protection of insurance. 
I have lived in this country for more than ten years. I have been working hard in some of Maine's 
most important industries like seafood processing,and childcare. Right now l work on the 
Portland waterfront cleaning and packing thousands of pounds of seafood on a daily basis. The 
job that me and my coworkers perform is critical, we make sure the products that come from the 
harbor are prepared to go to market. Without our labor, the fishermen's catch could never reach 
the consumer. 
I take pride in this work, and in being able to make a meaningful contribution to this community 
that I have been calling home for over a decade. My kids were born and raised here. My 
husband owns a business here. Yet, he and I cannot access Mainecare. I simply want the same 
access to Mainecare as any other resident of Maine. I want to ability to care for myself if I am 
sick. I worked throughout the pandemic as an essential worker without any protection. I got sick 
many times, and could not afford treatment. 
Workers are not separate from the work they do, and there is a limit to how long people can go 
on working without having access to basic services. I think it's time for Maine, the legislature 
and the governor to invest back into us who have been working tirelessly to keep Maine's 
economy going through thick and thin. Thank you very much for your time.
