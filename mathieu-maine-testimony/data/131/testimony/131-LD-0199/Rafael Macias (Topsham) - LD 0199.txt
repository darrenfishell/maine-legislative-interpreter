Dear HHS Committee,
What kind of Americans will our New Mainers meet first? Will they meet the ones 
that look at the Statue of Liberty and recognize it as our national invitation to freedom
and opportunity or will they meet Americans that see new immigrants as a border 
crisis and tax burden? In elementary school, I learned that America’s nickname is the 
“Melting Pot”, and that America is stronger as a result. When immigrants arrive in 
Maine, shouldn’t we welcome them?
Will they meet the kind of Americans that deny them immediate job opportunities and
much-needed healthcare to avoid Maine being seen as a magnet for needy foreigners, 
or will they meet Americans that recognize the benefits to everyone when we open 
our door to those in need? 
Will New Mainers meet the kind of Americans that recognize their ancestors were 
once immigrants, too, or will they meet the ones that turn their backs on what it 
means to be an American. So many Americans claim America is a Christian nation, 
yet many of them choose not to live like it. 
Which Americans will New Mainers meet first? It’s your call. 
I support LD 199.
Very Respectfully,
Rafael Macias
