My

is

to
pr o viding
inf ormation,
education
and
adv ocacy
on
immigration
and
r elated
issues
fr om
the

In

nearl y
100
Maine
businesses,
chambers
of
commer ce ,
trade
associations,
and
higher
education
institutions
signed
the
Maine
Compact
on
Immigration
1
urging
state
leaders
to
“adopt
policies
and
practices
to
help
Maine
become
a
destination
of
choice
f or
immigrants
to
the
U .S.
and
that
pr o vide
an
en vir onment
wher e
immigrants
can
r each
their
full
potential
in
our
state . ”
LD
199
clearl y
r epr esents
such
a
policy .
Maine
is
the
nation's
oldest
state .
With
our
lo w
bir th
rates,
Maine
had
the
dubious
distinction
of
being
pr ojected
to
hit
the
tipping
point
of
mor e
people
being
o v er
age
65
than
under
age
18,
a
full
15

ahead
of
the

England.

Immigrants

Immigrants
in
Maine
earn
an
estimated
$1.6
billion
in
household
income
and
contribute
$441
million
in
f ederal,
state ,

When
Congr ess
decided
to
r emak e
the
f ederal
w elfar e
system
in
1996,
it
did
so
largel y
on
the
backs
of
immigrants.
A
majority
of
the
financial
sa vings
of
f ederal
w elfar e
r ef orm
was
accomplished
b y
taking
benefits
a wa y
fr om
immigrants.
Since
then,
permanent
r esidents
who
ha v e
had
their
"gr een
car ds"
f or
less
than
fiv e
y ears
ar e
ineligible
f or
most
f ederal
public
benefits,
as
ar e
asylum
seek ers,
those
with
T emporar y
Pr otected
Status
who
ha v e
been
living
her e
legall y
-
in
most
cases
f or
tw o
decades
or
mor e ,
those
with
D A C A
who
came
to
the
U .S.
as
childr en,
spouses,
and
childr en
of
U .S.
citizens
who
ar e
in
the
pr ocess
of
a ppl ying
f or
r esidency ,
and
m yriad
other
categ ories
of
immigrants.
Despite
w orking
and
pa ying
tax es,
f ederal
la w
pr ohibits
these
and
other
immigrants
fr om
accessing
most
public
benefits.
Maine
has
f or tunatel y
decided
to
co v er
some
of
these
people ,
including
childr en,
people
with
disabilities,
and
pr egnant
people .
But
man y
of
Maine's
immigrants
ineligible
under
f ederal
public
benefits
eligibility
la w
r emain
left
out.
Man y
immigrants
w ork
in
full-time
jobs
that
don’ t
pr o vide
health
insurance
and
don’ t
pa y
enough
to
lift
them
out
of
po v er ty .
As
a
r esult,
when
ill,
man y
dela y
or
a v oid
car e
because
the y
f ear
the y
will
be
unable
to
pa y
the
medical
costs.
Expanding
MaineCar e
to
all
income-eligible
immigrants
will
help
Maine’ s
immigrants
get
health
car e
sooner ,
to
pr e v ent
or
catch
illness
bef or e
it
becomes
mor e
serious,
mor e
de vastating
to
them
and
their
families,
and
mor e
costl y
to
tr eat.
Expanded
MaineCar e
will
lead
to
healthier
families
and
comm unities
in
general,
and
to
a
healthier
w orkf or ce .
I
urge
y ou
to
pass
LD
199
because
it
is
both
the
right
thing
to
do
f or
those
who
ar e
cur r entl y
left
behind,
but
also
because
it
is
an
in v estment
in
our
futur e
w orkf or ce
and
econom y .
