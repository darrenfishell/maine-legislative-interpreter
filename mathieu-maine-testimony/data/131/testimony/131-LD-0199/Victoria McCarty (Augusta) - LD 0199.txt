Testimony of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project in Support of LD 199, 
"An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions 
to the MaineCare Program"
Good day, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. 
My name is Victoria McCarty and I live in Augusta. I am writing to you in 
support of LD 199: “An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by 
Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.”
I echo all the thoughts and sentiments of those who support this bill. 
Access to good healthcare coverage allows folks who live in the state of 
Maine, citizen and noncitizen alike the opportunity to make valuable 
contributions to the welfare of our state. Please help insure access to 
healthcare for ALL Maine residents, regardless of citizenship status by 
voting “Ought to Pass” on LD 199.
Thank you.
Victoria McCarty
Augusta
