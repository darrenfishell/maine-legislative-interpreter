Sirad Galab’s Testimony 
My name is Sirad Galab, and I'd like to introduce myself to Senator Baldacci, Representative 
Meyer, and the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. I'm 
here today to speak in support of LD 199. 
In 2016, I came to this country for asylum, hoping for safety and a better life. Unfortunately, my 
health has been a constant source of concern since then. I have diabetes, high blood pressure, 
stomach problems, high cholesterol, and vision problems, and I've lost most of my teeth without 
knowing why. As a result of my age and health, I cannot work full-time. Every day is a struggle, 
and I can’t afford my medication or health care. 
I only work two hours per week as a Personal Support Service (PSS) to pay for my medication 
and to survive. I have to go for a PCP check-up every three months, and every time I do, I get 
bills from hospitals that I can't pay. The bills frighten me, and I'm concerned about how to pay 
them. 
Living with a chronic illness is difﬁcult. It's a never-ending battle, not just for your health but 
also for the ﬁnancial burden that comes with it. I feel helpless and alone in this ﬁght, and it 
breaks my heart that I have to rely on my minimal income to get the care I need. I urge you to 
support LD 199 and ensure that everyone in Maine, regardless of income, has access to quality 
healthcare. It's time for a change, and I hope my story will motivate you to act. 
Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story.
