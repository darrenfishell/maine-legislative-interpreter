Selam Runyon-Baruch ’s Testimony 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services: my name is Selam 
Runyon-Baruch. I am here today to share my story in support of LD 199. Access to 
healthcare is a fundamental human right. I want the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services to consider the emotional toll our current healthcare 
system has on individuals like me. 
Six years ago, I was in a severe car accident that changed my life forever. At the 
time, I didn't have health insurance, and I remember feeling helpless when the 
ofﬁcer asked if he could call an ambulance for me. I had to refuse because I 
couldn't afford it, even though I had blacked out during the accident and had cuts 
and bruises all over my body. 
It's been six years since that accident, and I still remember the fear and anxiety that 
came with the realization that my health was not a priority in our current system. 
While I am fortunate enough to have health insurance now, I understand what it 
means to live with the fear of not having access to healthcare. 
As someone who has experienced the shortcomings of our current healthcare 
system ﬁrsthand, I implore you to consider the human impact of this issue. No one 
should have to choose between their health and ﬁnancial security. The emotional 
toll of feeling that your health is not valued can be overwhelming. Let's work 
together to ensure that every person in Maine can access the care they need to live 
a healthy and fulﬁlling life. 
Thank you for allowing me to share my story, and I urge you to support LD 199.
