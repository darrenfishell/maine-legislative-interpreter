Re: Testimony in support of LD 199, An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by 
Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program
My name is Mary Laughlin.  I live in Limington.  As I understand, LD 199 will 
restore access to MaineCare for eligible noncitizen Maine residents, similar to the 
access citizen residents now have.  People who do not have MaineCare wait until they
are very sick and then seek health care from emergency rooms.  This pattern is risky 
to their individual health and disastrous to the costs of our health care system.  
All people need access to health insurance so they can establish a relationship with 
their health providers to cultivate preventative care, as much as possible, to develop 
and maintain better health. 
Lack of access to MaineCare threatens public health throughout our state, inflates the 
cost of health care needlessly, and threatens the lives of individuals, also.   Please vote
"ought to pass" for LD 199.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mary Laughlin
