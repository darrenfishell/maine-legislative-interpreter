Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director,  
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  
 
In Support of LD 199 “An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the 
MaineCare Program ” 
March 28, 2023  
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and members of the Health and Human  Services Committee . My name 
is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the North Atlantic  Region for the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the lead Government 
Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer 
Society, supports evidence -based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health 
problem. As the nation’s leading advocate for public policies that ar e helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures 
that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public policy matters at all levels of 
government.  
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to submit the following testimony  in support o f LD 199. The 
American Cancer Society and  ACS CAN  believe that everyone should have a fair and just opportunity to prevent, 
detect, treat, and survive cancer. Cancer impacts everyone and critical  to eliminating disparities and ensuring 
health equity is to guarantee that all individuals have access to affordable health coverage . 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. However, despite 
these coverage gains, twelve years after the law was enacted approximately 27 million people in the United 
States ,i including more than 72,000 people in Maine,ii remain uninsured. Data shows that noncitizens are more 
likely to be uninsured. In 202 1, 25% of lawfully present individuals and 4 6% of undocumented immigr ants were 
uninsured, compared to only 8 percent of U.S. citizens.iii 
Having adequate and affordable health insurance coverage is a key determinant for surviving cancer. Research 
from the American Cancer Society shows that uninsured people  are less likely to  get screened for cancer and 
thus are more likely to have their cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage when survival is less likely and the cost 
of care more expensive.iv Access to care for those who are undocumented not only ensures that serious diseases 
like cancer can be detected and treated earlier but also often means better patient outcomes and less costs to 
the individual and the system.  
As state and federal policymakers consider legislation to expand health care access to all individuals, ACS CAN 
evaluates  these policy proposals based on the following criteria:  
• Whether the proposal will result in access to meaningful health insurance available to all regardless of 
citizenship status;  
• Whether the coverage is adequate and provides those services cance r patients need most including 
evidence -based cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and follow -up;

• Whether the coverage reduces administrative burdens and barriers.  
ACS CAN  advocate s for access to affordable, comprehensive coverage to better prevent, treat and survive 
cancer regardless of citizenship status , thereby ending cancer as we know it for everyone.  LD 199 builds on the 
steps taken by the Maine Legislature in 2021 that expande d access to MaineCare and CHIP coverage for people 
under age 21 and pregnant people, regardless of immigration status  by allowing the remainin g Maine adults 
who are currently excluded from MaineCare coverage due to immigration status  to have access to heal th 
coverage . 
For the above reasons, we urge you to vote “ought to pass”  on LD 199.  We appreciate your time and 
consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about this testimony.
