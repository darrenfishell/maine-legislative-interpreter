LD 199
To members of the Committee on Health and Human Services:
I am writing to urge your support for LD 199, “An Act to Improve the Health of 
Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.”
I currently receive MaineCare, because my income is low enough. But, my health is 
generally pretty good. If I deserve subsidized health care, than certainly individuals 
who also have low incomes and not nearly as much access to financial support, 
including but not limited to newly arrived immigrants to the US, should also be able 
to receive MaineCare benefits. 
A population that is in good health or has access to health care when problems arise, 
is a healthy society. If we deny health coverage to anyone who needs it, we are a sick 
society, both literally and figuratively. 
Please vote to support LD 199, “An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by 
Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.” Help insure access to healthcare 
for ALL Maine residents, regardless of citizenship status.
