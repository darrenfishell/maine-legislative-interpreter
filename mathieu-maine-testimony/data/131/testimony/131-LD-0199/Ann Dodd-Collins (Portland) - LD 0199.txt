LD 199
Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee of Health and Human Services on 
LD 199 on March 28, 2023 in support of LD 199, Act to Improve the Health of Maine
Residents by Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.
Senator Joseph Baldacci, Representative Michele Meyer, and Members of the 
Committee:
My name is Ann Dodd-Collins and I am a resident of Portland. I am testifying in 
support of LD 199,  An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing 
Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.  As a retiree, I am blessed to have the time and
energy to volunteer with Greater Portland Family Promise and at the Preble Street 
Teen Center.  I spend time with people, those who are U.S. citizens and those who 
hope to one day become citizens, who cannot afford health care.  This bill would 
ensure that all low income Mainers, regardless of their citizenship status, would have 
access to MaineCare coverage.  To me, health care is a right and should be available 
to everyone, not just those who can afford it or who happened to be born in the United
States.  Health care for all is a matter of fairness and equity.
Please vote Ought To Pass on LD 199.
Sincerely, Ann Dodd-Collins
