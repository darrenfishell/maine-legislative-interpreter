LD 199
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is 
Gwendolyn Forrest, I live in Portland, and I am here today to testify in favor of LD 
199.
Taking care of each other is what gets us through hard times. But right now, many 
people in our community – including asylum seekers, green card holders, and others 
with temporary protected status – do not have access to the care they need, despite all 
they contribute to Maine, including taxes. LD 199 can help change that by making 
sure that MaineCare covers everyone with low-income.
My father, who lives out of state, has fronto-temporal dementia and is currently being 
cared for by several home health care workers who are from Ghana. They are very 
skilled, deeply loving, and absolutely essential to my father’s care. Though each of 
them has access to health care, many people who they are in community with do not, 
including those seeking asylum. In a recent conversation with one of my father’s 
caregivers, she described how people she knows who are seeking asylum attempt to 
self-medicate to get through health issues, and the risks they are forced to take in 
doing so. If everyone had access to health care regardless of immigration status, this 
would not be the case. 
Our wellbeing is linked. It is in all of our best interest to care for each other, and we 
need a health care system that works for everyone. Your vote in favor of LD 199 will 
help make this a reality. Thank you for your attention and your time today.
