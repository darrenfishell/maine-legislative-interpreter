Good afternoon Chair Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of 
the Committee on Health and Human Services. 
My name is Devon Stockmayer, and I am the Advocacy Supervisor at 
Preble Street in Portland. I am here today to ask for your support in the 
passage of LD199: An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by 
Removing Exclusions to the MaineCare Program.  
There is a sign that hangs above my office desk which reads, 
“Healthcare is a human right.” This feels so intuitive to me, and yet it is 
not our reality. The current parameters of the MaineCare program 
exclude the majority of folks in our immigrant community, including 
some of the most vulnerable subgroups such as the elderly and 
immunocompromised. Denying people health insurance coverage 
because of their immigration status sends a message that we do not 
value all parts of the community equally. Individuals deemed indefinitely 
ineligible are made to confront mountains of medical expenses. Paying a 
hospital bill could mean shutting off the heat in the dead of winter, or 
drastically reducing one’s food budget and intake to make ends meet. 
These are choices that should never have to be made — choices that 
sow stress and worsen  health.  
At Preble Street, particularly in our Teen Services, Community Case 
Management, and Street Outreach programs, we work with many folks 
in the immigrant population who experience exclusion from MaineCare. 
Adjusting to a new country can be an overwhelming and at times 
terrifying ordeal, especially if you are without essential protections like 
basic healthcare access. One former Preble Street client, originally from 
Honduras, came to Portland after a long journey of fleeing his home 
country, seeking, and gaining asylum in Mexico. Unable to find work and 
safety there, he crossed the border into Texas, looking to find work in 
the United States. He then moved on from Texas and migrated to New 
York City, still seeking employment, but had no luck. He landed in 
Portland after a meandering journey north. There, at last, he got a job, 
processing lobsters and other seafood at a local fish factory. During this 
time, he injured his hand— a severe laceration which prevented major 
movement and functionality. 
Due to the client’s immigrant status, he was not eligible for healthcare 
coverage in Maine, which could have saved him immense stress at the 
time of his injury. Instead, the client sought workman’s compensation in 
an attempt to pay off the medical bills. The out-of-pocket expenses for 
such an injury were alarmingly high. He connected to Preble Street’s 
Street Outreach team, seeking support. A caseworker helped him 
translate from his native Spanish to work with a lawyer at the Volunteer 
Lawyers Project. To date, the case remains unresolved, leaving the 
client haunted by piles of medical bills. This is the kind of daunting, 
untenable situation that a lack of MaineCare coverage puts so many of 
our immigrant friends in.

Equitable access to healthcare should not be a question that needs to 
be debated before the legislature, but an inherent right for all who 
reside in Maine, and in this country. In that light, I ask that you support 
the passage of LD199, because this bill is an opportunity to show that 
Maine cares for all of its residents.
