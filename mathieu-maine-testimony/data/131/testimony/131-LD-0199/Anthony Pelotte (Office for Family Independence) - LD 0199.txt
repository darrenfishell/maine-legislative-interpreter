Re:  LD 199 â€“ An Act to Improve the Health of Maine Residents by Removing Exclusions to the 
MaineCare Program  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative M eyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide you with information that might be helpful to you  in your deliberations regarding 
LD 199. The proposed legislation provides MaineCare coverage  for non -citizens who are ineligible for  
existing  coverage due to federal restriction s on Medicaid  eligibility. It also directs the Department  to seek 
available federal matching funds through waivers or state plan amendments to the Centers for Medicaid 
and Medicare Services (CMS).  
 
Maine currently provides  full coverage to all federally -approved qualified  non-citizens (42 CFR 435.406), 
including electing to cover optional groups of lawfully present individuals under the age of 21 and 
pregnant women . In August 2022, MaineCare coverage was extended to individuals under the age of 21 
and preg nant women who do not have a federally approved qualified immigration status. Other non -
citizens who would qualify for Medicaid but for their immigration status , are provided limited coverage 
of emergency medical services.  
 
As federal law does not provide  options via state plan amendment or waiver to extend Medicaid coverage  
to individuals who do not have a qualifying immigration status , expanding full coverage to this population 
would require state  general funds.  Additionally, there will be a cost to chang es required in  the eligibility 
and claims system to accommodate this policy change.  January 1, 2024 is not a feasible implementation 
date. This policy change woul d require 12 to 18 months at minimum to implement.  
 
Finally, while some states provide coverage to certain age groups within this population, most do not and 
we are unaware of other New England states that cover this population.  
 
We wanted you to be aware  of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If you have 
any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Antony Pelotte, Director  
Office for Family Independence
