RE: LD199
I believe this an important bill that will provide value to the State of Maine and to all 
those who are currently excluded from receiving health care coverage.
Beyond being a humanitarian response to a very difficult situation in the lives of 
people who are not citizens of the state of Maine, it will save the State money by 
allowing people to engage in the healthcare system at the onset of any medical 
condition rather than wait until it brings them to an emergency room and 
hospitalization which is a far greater cost.
Further, it allows them to maintain and possibly improve their health allowing them to
fully engage and contribute to our great State. 
We need immigrants and others to come to Maine to fill jobs in a variety of areas 
especially the Hospitality industry which is vital to the Maine economy. Without new 
people coming to Maine many jobs will go unfilled and businesses weaken.
Thank you.
Janet Eastman
