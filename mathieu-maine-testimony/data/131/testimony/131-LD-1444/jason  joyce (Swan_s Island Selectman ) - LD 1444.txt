LD 1444
 Dear Members of Marine Resources committee,
 I urge your support of 1444 and wish it could go further to allow those who 
participated in 22' to be eligible for a license. We have some local fishermen who 
took the plunge last year and sold fish locally which helped ease the strain on our 
limited available bait supply. 
 Until the last few years, unlike midcoast and further southern waters, pogies were 
only here locally in 1988/1989 and seemed a risky venture for most to make such an 
investment in gear. Those who did now find themselves locked out of the fishery.
 While disappointed that the traditional purse seine was removed from the picture for 
part of the season, it was good that our Commissioner was able to secure more quota 
and hope our state is able to increase our share of this fishery at the next opportunity.
 I realize it's not a huge quota increase but for fishermen in our area it would be 
helpful to have access to this fishery. 
 Thank you for your consideration of this bill. 
 Sincerely, 
Jason Joyce- Swan's Island Lobsterman/Selectman
