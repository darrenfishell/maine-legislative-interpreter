LD 1444
I am Thomas McLennan. I am a 3rd generation commercial fisherman. I have 
dedicated my life to fishing. I graduated high school in 3 years just to get ahead. I had
a menhaden business established with my wife and children as crew. we decided to 
double down and purchased a 2nd fishing boat and fishing net. we invested a pile of 
money into the boat and fishing gear. LD1908 then took her liscense for not having it 
years before. ld1908 also let guys that had never harvested a fish but bought the 
lisence for a tax deduction go in 2022 to get their requirements and now hold the 
liscense. I am in full support of ld 1444.  thank you for your time.
