My name is Russ gauley I have been commercial fisherman in Maine for the last 4 
years and I fished under my license in 2021 and 2022 and under someone else's 
license in 2019 now my last 4 years of hard work was taken from me stolen from the 
state I had no money over the winter time to prepare myself for this so I had to sell 
my net my boat all my gear the state of Maine f***** me so hard that I have nothing 
left I did my best and followed all the rules and the state still stole my license from 
me now I'm left with nothing 4 years of hard work down the drain and 13 years of 
commercial fishing prior to that to figure out how to do it thanks
