I strongly support the change to allow fishermen to use catch dates of 2019, 2020, 
2021 and 2022 in order to keep their menhaden fishing license. Not only is the ability 
to catch their own bait an important part of their job, but how can you justify instantly
saying “no you can’t do this anymore” after they have spent thousands and thousands 
of dollars on equipment and had no idea they would be shut off from fishing? 
I have been a lobsterman all my life and in addition to lobstering, I also work to help 
my family catch our own bait and hope to continue to do so. With the high cost of 
fuel, catching our own bait gives us a small break in our expenses allowing us to 
continue working at the only job we know how to do. 
Sincerely, 
Captain Paula Jean Lunt
