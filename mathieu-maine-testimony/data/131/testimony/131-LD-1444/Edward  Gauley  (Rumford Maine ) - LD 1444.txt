I’m Ed Gauley. I invested my life savings of last 20 years into this fishery. I’m 57 
years old and moved back to Maine from California. Left my job. Sold my house. 
Came here bought a boat and permit. Caught fish paid all taxes. Broke No laws   
Submitted landings and invested 150 thousand dollars into this fishery. I was in 
Maine 20 years ago. As a single father of three minor children. Homeless in Oxford 
at. Shelter. Since then I’ve working hard as a fisherman. To one day return to Maine 
and be able to support myself. And I have until DMR. Took my livelihood away from
me with a stroke of an ink pen. Now I’m back on social services. Due to no fault of 
my own. Did I mention I have 150 thousand dollars in boat and equipment that’s 
worth little to nothing. I wish they had been transparent about changing climate in my
fishery. So I could have made a better decision about my financial future. As of now 
I’m back. Into the social services program once again. Due to no fault of my own. 
Please let me be clear. This is a disaster declaration. I am heading towards being 
homeless once again as a 57 year old able bodied man.I have done everything 
possible to succeed. And my livelihood has been stolen from me and my children. 
You have no idea how much unwanted stress and anxiety this has brought on me and 
my family. You have erased 20 year’s of my life’s best earnings. And reduced me 
from the American dream. This is a power grab to consolidate wealth to a small 
number of individuals. Who most of them if not all are on the Manhaddan board of 
directors. I’m looking into legal representation at this time. I’m sure my story is a non
issue to you. But to me it’s my life. I’ve been a fisherman for 45 years. Now I’m 
forced to start all over again. With no money and in debt. Sence I’ve been investing in
the fishery expecting to go fishing the next year. Now I’m looking at bankruptcy.
