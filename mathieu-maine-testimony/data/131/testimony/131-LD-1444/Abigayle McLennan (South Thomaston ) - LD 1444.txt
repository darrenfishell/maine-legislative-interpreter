Abigayle McLennan
South Thomaston 
LD 1444
To whom it may concern, 
My name is Abigayle McLennan and I have been a commercial mehanden 
fisherman alongside my husband, with our two young children, for the past four 
years. Four summers ago, before our daughters second birthday, we as a family 
started to responsibly fish together. My children and I are, and have been, my 
husbands crew. 
Two years ago I made the decision to purchase my own boat, and all of the 
equipment necessary, to be able to grow as a family, in the industry that we love and 
respect so much. Unfortunately, despite my substantial financial investment, and 
hours on the water fishing, LD1908 didn’t take my investment and countless hours on
the water into consideration. I have been completely cut out of this industry. I now 
have a boat and equipment that are of no use to our family unless LD1444 passes. 
LD1908 was completely unfair to people in the same situation as me. There were 
two requirements to keep a license, the folks that didn’t have landings were given an 
extra year to gain those, but those like me who had had landings were not given the 
year 2022 to make the cut. This was completely a unfair disadvantage to those of us 
who had actually been putting the time, money, and effort into the industry. I would 
like to assume that this was a complete oversight by those who created LD1908. 
Not only did the menhaden that I caught with my license help to support Maine 
Lobsterman, it also helped the Maine economy as I paid my taxes to the state on the 
money I earned. 
My family and I alongside with all of the other honest fisherman love and respect 
this industry. We are advocates for its incredible benefits to our state as a whole. 
I am fully in support of LD1444.
