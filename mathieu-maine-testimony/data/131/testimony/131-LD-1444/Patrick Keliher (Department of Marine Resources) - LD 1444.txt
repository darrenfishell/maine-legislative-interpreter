TESTIMONY OF 
Patrick Keliher 
Department of Marine Resources 
The Department of Marine Resources (DMR) is testifying 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1444 An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Eligibility Restrictions for 
Commercial Menhaden Fishing Licenses 
Before the Committee on Marine Resources 
Sponsored by Representative Faulkingham 
Date of Hearing: April 20, 2023 
Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources, my 
name is Patrick Keliher, Commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources, and I am testifying on behalf 
of the Department neither for nor against LD 1444. 
LD 1444 changes the requirements for eligibility for a commercial menhaden fishing license. Under current 
law, in order to be eligible for a commercial menhaden license in 2023, an individual must have possessed a 
license to fish commercially for menhaden in at least 2 of the following 3 years: 2019, 2020, or 2021. Under 
the proposed bill, in order to be eligible an individual must have possessed a license to fish commercially for 
menhaden in at least 2 of the following 4 years: 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022. 
In addition, the bill also proposes to change the date by which the Department must have received proof that 
the landings requirement (25,000 lbs) has been met from January 3%, 2023 to July 30: 2023. 
,l 
Based on the report back regarding LD 1908, you have heard that the number of commercial menhaden 
licenses currently authorized for 2023 is 367. By amending the years which can be used to establish the 
license history to include 2022, DMR has determined that an additional 40 licenses will be authorized. 
At this point, the fishery is well above the number of licenses the Department had recommended ("250) when 
the initial criteria were determined. An additional 40 licenses could represent an additional 720,000 lbs of 
landings per week. Additional licenses reduce opportunity to each individual license holder, increase the 
probability of catching the entirety ofthe quota in a shorter time frame negatively impacting the bait supply, 
and push the opportunity for new entry further out into the future. 
At this point, the Department would defer to the Committee on whether it is advisable to add the 40 
additional licenses. However, the Department is strongly opposed to the change that would allow the 
submission of late landing reports. Landings reports are due no later than the 15â€œ of the following month. 
Industry members were already put on notice that all reports needed to be submitted by January 30, 2023 in 
order to be considered for license eligibility. There is no reason to extend that further to July 2023, and in fact 
only invites the submission of falsified reports for the purpose of qualifying. Because there is no way of 
determining how many additional licenses this might create, the Department strongly opposes this specific 
change. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
