I didn't oppose the bill last year, that allowed a lot of licenses into the Menhaden 
fisheries. I DO OPPOSE this bill LD1444. The Emergency bill is allowing an extra 
year of landings (2021). When is this going to STOP? There was Menhaden in the 
Downeast area two years before I started seining for menhaden. I qualified for a 
license, everyone had a chance to qualify in that amount of time.  I was allowed to 
fish 7 days a week, now 3 and if this bill passes ... probably 2 days a week. Our Maine
quota changed from .52% to 4.8 % . BUT we always land around 6 %. Lets be honest,
it's just an erroneous assumption that we have gained  much more quota. UNTRUE, 
WE ALWAYS LAND 6%. It's not something that just happened or a reason to allow 
more Menhaden licenses. Any fisherman can get a non commercial license and 
harvest 3 barrels a day, 7 days a week for their own bait.
