Nicholas Lunt
St. George, Maine
LD 1444
Hi, my name is Nicholas Lunt and I’m a fisherman here in St. George, Maine who has
been working on the water my whole life as has my family for generations. This is a 
way of life and my 4 year old daughter looks forward to days on the water. 
I’d like to state my support for the amendment to LD1444. This will give more 
resources to the fishermen who need it the most. At a time when the resources will be 
beneficial. 
I will not be able to attend in person and will be welcoming the birth of my second 
child this week. I hope that this helps show support for the positive the amendment 
would bring.
