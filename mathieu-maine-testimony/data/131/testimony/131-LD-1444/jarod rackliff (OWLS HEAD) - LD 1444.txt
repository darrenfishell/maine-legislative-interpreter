My name is Jarod rackliff,
I’m here in regards to the new bill concerning manhaden.   The manhaden has been 
my sole income now for two years;  if I am not able to get my manhaden license it 
will be devastating to myself and my family ( five year old and a 12 year old).  My  
first year I had an insufficient boat for the fishery at the end of my 2021 year. 
    I looked for a bigger boat for the year ‘22 and was successful finding one; then I 
found out about the bill to put a moratorium on the license that I had been working so 
hard for.
   I have put a tremendous amount of time, money and energy  for preparation of the 
upcoming season.
   I have held my license for two years. I was planning on staying local in Maine to 
make a living.i have been fishing for scallops out of New Bedford mass for the past 
twenty years.
My body is getting to older to continue in that fishery.I have put everything I have 
had saved into a boat gear adequate for this coming season; that is now no longer 
available for fisherman such as myself.
  My future depends on this fishing season.
Thank you,
Jarod rackliff
