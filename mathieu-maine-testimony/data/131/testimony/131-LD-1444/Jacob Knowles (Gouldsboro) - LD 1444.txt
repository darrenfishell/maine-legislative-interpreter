I strongly endorse the proposed bill as it addresses several  issues that the previous 
bill failed to address. The retroactive date in the first bill had a devastating impact on 
many fishermen, myself included, and this proposed legislation would reduce those 
impacts by including the fisherman that were most unfairly excluded from the 
industry.
To illustrate my point, let me share my own experience. In anticipation of entering the
pogey fishery in 2021, I invested almost $30,000 in essential equipment. Due to covid
and related delays, I did not receive all the gear I needed until September 2021, which
was too late in the year to start fishing. Had I known about the retroactive date, I 
would have applied for the license earlier, and my investment would not have gone to 
waste. This retroactive dating really gives fisherman with one foot in the door a short 
straw.
It is critical to note that the proposed bill only benefits individuals who were already 
invested in the industry before 2022 and were excluded from the previous bill. 
Anyone who becomes eligible for a license under this new legislation had already 
invested in the industry and was unjustly excluded. Furthermore, the bill does not 
alter our open/closed access status, which was the primary reason for the original 
bill's closure. Therefore, I see no plausible reason for this bill not to pass.
While this legislation is a step in the right direction, it is not a perfect solution to the 
problems caused by the previous bill. Yes it would help some current fisherman, but 
we must consider the future of the fishery and establish an entry/exit system to ensure 
its future. What about the kids that were to young or in school between the years 2019
and 2021? Our children and the next generation must have access to the fishery, and 
we must think about their future. Without such a system, the fishery's future is bleak.
