LD 1444
I oppose BillLD1444. I thought this was taken care of. I didn't agree with the 25,000 
LB bill or the Amendment that Billy Bob added to it. I would much rather see 
Legislature Tier the licenses in the Menhaden Fishery. We do our reports of landings 
for a reason. Annually, Maine lands 6% of Menhaden. People are assuming that we 
have gained much more quota, but we really didn't. We went from .52% to 4.8%  but 
regardless we have always landed 6% or so. Its not new folks! Don't forget the non 
commercial license for $98 that allows 3 barrels of bait, 7 days a week using a gillnet 
or hand seine for FREE BAIT. My husband and I both got into the Menhaden Fishery.
We heard talk of limited entry back then. Others had the same notice and opportunity 
as we did.
