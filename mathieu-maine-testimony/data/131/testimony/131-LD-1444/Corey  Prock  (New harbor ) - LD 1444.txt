Corey  Prock 
New harbor 
LD 1444
Hi my name is Corey Prock I am a third generation commercial fisherman. I have 
been a lobster fisherman for the last twenty years. The increasing costs of bait make it
hard to get ahead. I invested a significant amount of money into purchasing a boat and
net in order to catch my own bait. LD1908 will prohibit the ability for me to catch my
own bait and I will no longer  have use for the gear That I purchased. I am in full 
support of ld 1444. Thanks
