Testimony in Support of LD 1250 An Act Regarding Paying Providers Sufficiently, 
Maintaining Short Waiting Lists, and Creating a Cause of Action for Aggrieved 
Persons in the System of Car for Clients with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism.   
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee: 
 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. 
I am in support of LD 1250 because providers and staff should be paid in a timely 
manner and a livable wage.  When support staff are not paid well, they tend to move on 
to a better paying job.   It is important for us to have consistent support staff that work 
with us.   
In addition, it is important to have short waitlists.   When people are on long waitlists, 
they feel discouraged.   Services are important for us, and waiting for services is a big 
barrier.      
 
If support staff are paid well, they will stay at their job.   As a result, there won’t be as 
many openings for support staff, and this could in turn help waitlists.   
 
I ask you to support LD 1250.   
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
