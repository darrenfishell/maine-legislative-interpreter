LD 1250
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee,
As the parent of a young man with autism who has significant challenges in 
completing activities of daily living, I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1250.  
This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to pay providers of 
services and supports sufficiently to ensure that persons with intellectual disabilities, 
autism, brain injury or other related conditions receive the same level of care as the 
general population.  Current reimbursement rates are inadequate to insure a stable 
system of residential supports.  In 1996, Maine had one of the best systems in the 
nation, and it has only declined in the past 25 years.  Waiting lists did not exist in 
2011.  In 2023, over 1,800 Mainers are on a waiting list and not receiving services 
that they have been approved for by DHHS. This number has not changed in the last 
six years. All of them are at risk for abuse, neglect or exploitation as DHHS has 
acknowledged by approving them for section 21 services. Creating a cause of action 
for persons aggrieved by violations by the DHHS in performing the departmentâ€™s 
responsibilities may motivate the department to address these issues.
