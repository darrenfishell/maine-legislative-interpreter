Testimony in Favor of LD 1559 – An Act to Advance the State’s Public Transit 
Systems by Reinvigorating the Public Transit Authority Council and Increasing 
Funding
Investing in Maine’s public transit system is good for Maine people AND for Maine’s
environment.  
All people deserve transportation options for travel needs.  Investing in Maine’s 
public transit system expands transportation options, which expands access to job 
opportunities and basic daily needs, for all people.  Providing transportation options is
at the heart of transportation equity.  
Supporting existing local transit and expanding rural transit planning will help 
decrease car dependence.  Decreasing car dependence and associated greenhouse gas 
emissions is necessary to help Maine achieve its climate action goals.  Increasing 
funding for public transit is key to creating the future of sustainable transportation in 
Maine.
