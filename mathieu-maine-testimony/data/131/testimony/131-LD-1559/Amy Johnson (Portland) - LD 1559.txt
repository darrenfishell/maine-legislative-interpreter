LD 1559
Dear Sen. Chipman, Rep. Williams, and honorable members of the Transportation 
Committee,
I write in support of LD 1559, An Act to Advance the State's Public Transit Systems 
by Reinvigorating the Public Transit Advisory Council and Increasing Funding. As a 
resident of Portland, I have the privilege of having adequate access to public transit 
options. 
However, in my volunteer life I work with an organization, Greater Portland Family 
Promise,  that supports families experiencing homelessness.  Transportation is a 
critical barrier to the families we work with. The housing shortage in Maine is 
well-known, and options in greater Portland are extremely limited.  Families would 
welcome the opportunity to relocate to areas of the state where housing is (somewhat)
more available, and where towns are in desperate need of workers to sustain their 
local economies.  Yet even in well-developed municipalities like Augusta, the lack of 
robust public transportation takes these towns out of the running. 
Our economic development relies on adequate transportation options for all segments 
of the workforce.  The time is ripe to reinvigorate the Advisory Council and take a 
fresh look at Maine's priorities for public transportation investment.
Thank you for your favorable consideration of LD 1559.
Sincerely,
Amy Johnson
Portland
