To: Joint Standing Committee on Transportation
Fr:  Jack De Beradinis, Executive Director; Regional 
      Transportation Program (RTP)
Dear Committee Members:
I write to urge your committee to provide full support for LD1559.
RTP has long provided transportation for disabled, senior, low-income and general 
public riders throughout Cumberland County.  Our demand/response service 
transports individuals to critical medical appointments and treatments, special needs 
schooling, family and child visitations, senior shopping, entertainment, etc.  Our 
paratransit service transports disabled individuals who are unable to use the public 
fixed-route systems in the Greater Portland area due to their physical and/or mental 
challenges.  As a State-designated "regional transportation corporation," RTP also 
operates the Lakes Region Explorer that provides public rural transportation for the 
communities along Route 302 from Bridgton to Portland.
As with other transportation providers throughout the State, RTP is constrained to 
expand its current services due to the dramatic increase in capital and operating costs 
related to vehicles, labor, services, supplies, etc.  Our normal funding sources remain 
unable to increase funding sufficient to cover these additional expenses.  The special 
FTA funding we received during the COVID period is now due to expire leaving a 
substantial funding gap that we will be unable to bridge without the prospect of 
reductions in service.
I submit that increased funding through LD1559 will well serve our ridership and the 
thousands of residents and visitors throughout Maine who depend on the availability 
of quality public and specialized transportation.
Thank you for your consideration.
