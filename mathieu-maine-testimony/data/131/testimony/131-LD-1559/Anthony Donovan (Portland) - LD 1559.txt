Re: In Support of LD 1559  to Advance the State's Public Transit Systems  
Senator Chipman , Representative Williams , and members of the Transportation Committee,  
 
My name is Tony Donovan, I am a Portland resident and founding Member of the Maine Rail 
Transit Coalition (MRTC). The Maine Rail Transit Coalition (MRTC) lobbies for f ederal, state 
and local policies that promote equitable funding of transit services for all. MRTC’s vision is a 
comprehensive transit design connecting passenger rail service with local transit systems to 
promote economic and environmental sustainability.    
 
The MRTC is here in to speak in support of LD 1559 An Act to Advance the State's 
Public Transit Systems by Reinvigorating the Public Transit Advisory Council and 
Increasing Funding .  
 
Public trans it is an essential part of modern transportation infrastructure, providing a range of 
benefits to individuals, communities, and society . Some of the key reasons why public transit is 
important include:  
• Accessibility: Public transit provides a cr itical lifeline for people who don't have access to 
other forms of transportation, such as those who can't afford a car, those who are unable to 
drive due to physical or cognitive limitations, or those who live in areas without adequate 
transportation infr astructure.  
• Affordability: Public transit is often more affordable than owning and operating a car, 
which can be a significant financial burden for many households. By providing a low -cost 
transportation option, public transit helps to promote greater economic mobilit y and reduce 
income inequality.  
• Sustainability: Public transit is a more environmentally sustainable mode of transportation 
than single -occupancy vehicles, as it helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other 
pollutants that contribute to climate chang e and air pollution.  
• Congestion reduction: By providing an alternative to driving, public transit helps to reduce 
traffic congestion on roads and highways, which can improve travel times and reduce the 
economic and environmental costs associated with conge stion.  
• Social connectivity: Public transit helps to connect people and communities, providing 
opportunities for social interaction and fostering a sense of community cohesion.  
 
Overall, public transit plays a critical role in promoting accessibility, afford ability, sustainability, 
congestion reduction, and social connectivity, making it an essential component of modern 
transportation infrastructure.

LD 1559 involves the Public  Transit Advisory Council in identify ing measurable goals related to 
expansion, efficiency, affordability, and environmental impact. This involve s several  steps, such 
as conducting research, gathering data and stakeholder input, and devel oping specific targets and 
metrics to measure progress.  
 
To begin, the Public Transit Advisory Council would define what is meant by "expansion," 
"efficiency," "affordability," and "environmental impact" in the context of public transit. For 
example , expansion could refer to increasing the coverage area or frequency of transit service and  
incorporating  passenger train services into the modal choices. Affordability encompass es factors 
such as fare prices and accessibility, while  environmental involve s reducing emissions or 
promoting the use of passenger train with good connectivity  to bus, ride share and non -motorized  
means of mobility . 
 
Once these definitions have been established, the Council could then work to identify specific, 
measurable goals related to reducing transit -related emissions, improving accessibility for low -
income riders, or promoting the use of public transit among specific populations.   To ensure that 
these goals are meaningful and achievable, the Council would need to gather input from a variety 
of stakeholders, including transit riders, advocacy groups, and transit operators. They might also 
review best practices from other cities or r egions that have successfully implemented similar 
initiatives.  
 
Overall, the directive to identify measurable goals related to expansion, efficiency, affordability, 
and environmental impact is an important step in promoting the continued growth and 
sustaina bility of public transit systems. By setting clear targets and metrics, the Council can help 
ensure that public transit is meeting the needs of riders and communities in a way that is equitable, 
efficient, and environmentally responsible.  
 
Incorporating a public participation process into the development of measurable goals for public 
transit expansion, efficiency, affordability, and environmental impact is an important step in 
ensuring that the goals are reflective of the needs and prio rities of the community.  
 
One way to do this is to engage in a robust public outreach campaign that seeks input from a 
diverse range of stakeholders, including transit riders, community members, advocacy groups, and 
other interested parties. This could involve hosting public forums , conducting surveys, and using 
social media or other digital platforms to solicit feedback.  
In addition, it can be helpful to provide opportunities for ongoing dialogue and engagement 
throughout the goal -setting process, so that stakeholders can provide i nput and feedback at key 
milestones. This could involve establishing a community advisory board or other formal 
mechanism for ongoing stakeholder engagement.

Overall, incorporating a public participation process into the development of measurable goals for 
public transit expansion, efficiency, affordability, and environmental im pact can help to ensure 
that the goals are reflective of the needs and priorities of the community, and can promote greater 
buy-in and support for transit initiatives over the long term.  
 
I’d be happy to answer any questions.
