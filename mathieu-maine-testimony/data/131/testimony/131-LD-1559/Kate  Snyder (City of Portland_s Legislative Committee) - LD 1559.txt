Testimony in Support of LD 1559 “An Act to Advance the State's Public Transit Systems 
by Reinvigorating the Public Transit Advisory Council and Increasing Funding” 
Senator Chipman, Representative Lynne Williams, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
I write to you on behalf of the City of Portland’s Legislative/Nominating Committee in Support 
of LD 1559, An Act to Advance the State's Public Transit Systems by Reinvigorating the 
Public Transit Advisory Council and Increasing Funding. 
Public transportation provides vital connections for Mainers in both urban and rural areas, 
allowing them to access employment, medical appointments, grocery shopping, and other 
important services.  
Maine has long faced a systemic lack of funding and coordination for public transit, which has 
had a significant impact on the state's economy, environment, and overall quality of life. This 
bill represents an important step forward in addressing these issues and building a more 
sustainable and equitable future for all Mainers. For all these reasons we urge you to support 
LD 1559.  
Thank you for your consideration.
