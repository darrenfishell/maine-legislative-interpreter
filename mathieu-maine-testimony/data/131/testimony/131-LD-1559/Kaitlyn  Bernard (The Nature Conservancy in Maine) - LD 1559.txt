Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing 
Committee
on
T ransportation,
my
name
is
Kaitlyn
Nuzzo
and
I
am
the
Government 
Relations
Director
for
The
Nature
Conservancy
in
Maine.
I
appreciate
this
opportunity 
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1559,
An
Act
to
Advance
the
State's
Public
T ransit 
Systems
by
Reinvigorating
the
Public
T ransit
Advisory
Council
and
Increasing 
Funding
W e
would
like
to
thank
Representative
O’Neil
for
bringing
this
important 
legislation
forward.
The
Nature
Conservancy
(TNC)
is
a
nonprofit
conservation
organization
dedicated
to 
conserving
the
lands
and
waters
on
which
all
life
depends.
Guided
by
science,
we 
create
innovative,
on-the-ground
solutions
to
our
world’ s
toughest
challenges
so
that 
nature
and
people
can
thrive
together .
W e
use
a
collaborative
approach
that
engages 
local
communities,
governments,
the
private
sector ,
and
other
partners.
The
Nature 
Conservancy
has
been
leading
conservation
in
Maine
for
more
than
60
years
and
is
the 
12th
largest
landowner
in
the
state,
owning
and
managing
roughly
300,000
acres.
W e 
also
work
across
Maine
to
restore
rivers
and
streams,
partner
with
fishermen
in
the
Gulf 
of
Maine
to
rebuild
groundfish
populations,
and
develop
innovative
solutions
to
address 
our
changing
climate.
W e
are
in
strong
support
of
LD
1559,
which
aims
to
improve
and
reinvigorate
the
state's 
public
transit
systems
by
increasing
funding,
promoting
coordination,
and
facilitating 
long-term
planning.
Maine
has
long
faced
a
systemic
lack
of
funding
and
coordination
for
public
transit, 
which
has
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
state's
economy ,
environment,
and
overall 
quality
of
life.
This
bill
represents
an
important
step
forward
in
addressing
these
issues 
and
building
a
more
sustainable
and
equitable
future
for
all
Mainers.
One
of
the
key
provisions
of
the
bill
is
the
requirement
for
the
Public
T ransit
Advisory 
Council
to
meet
four
times
per
year ,
identify
measurable
goals
for
expansion,
ef ficiency , 
af fordability ,
and
environmental
impact
in
each
geographic
region,
and
report
that 
information
to
the
Department
of
T ransportation.
This
will
ensure
that
the
council
is
able 
to
provide
frequent
and
relevant
recommendations
on
public
transit
decisions
and 
promote
the
interests
of
public
transit
stakeholders
across
the
state.

The
bill
also
amends
the
transportation
policy
in
the
Sensible
T ransportation
Policy
Act 
to
include
facilitating
and
supporting
public
transportation
systems
in
the
State
and 
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions,
solidifying
Maine's
commitment
to
public
transit
in 
statute.
By
amending
T itle
23,
the
bill
makes
an
explicit
commitment
to
public
transit
in 
DOT's
decisions
on
capital
investments,
transit
planning,
and
projects,
ensuring
that 
public
transit
is
considered
as
a
viable
option
in
all
transportation
planning
activities.
Furthermore,
the
bill
expands
the
membership
of
the
Public
T ransit
Advisory
Council 
and
authorizes
it
to
establish
a
steering
committee
with
the
Commissioner
of 
T ransportation
to
direct
the
work
of
the
council.
This
will
ensure
that
the
council
is 
representative
of
all
stakeholders
and
has
the
resources
it
needs
to
ef fectively
promote 
public
transit
across
the
state.
The
Advisory
Council
is
directed
by
the
bill
to
prepare
a 
statewide
transit
plan
and
a
statewide
mobility
management
program,
which
will
help
to 
coordinate
local
and
regional
transit
needs
and
ensure
that
public
transit
is
an
integral 
part
of
Maine's
transportation
system.
In
conclusion,
I
strongly
urge
you
to
support
this
bill
and
take
action
to
improve
Maine's 
public
transit
systems.
By
bolstering
state
transit
planning
and
assistance,
increasing 
state
funding
for
on-road
public
transit,
and
solidifying
Maine's
commitment
to
public 
transit
in
statute,
we
can
build
a
more
sustainable,
equitable,
and
prosperous
future
for 
all
Mainers.
