Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams,
and
the
honorable
members
of
the
T ransportation
Committee.
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco,
and
I
am
here
representing
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
across
the
state
from
varying
backgrounds.
I
am
here
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1559,
An
Act
to
Advance
the
State's
Public
T ransit
Systems
by
Reinvigorating
the
Public
T ransit
Advisory
Council
and
Increasing
Funding.
Before
I
delve
into
why
LD
1559
is
monumental
for
the
future
of
our
state,
there
is
a
harsh
reality
for
young
Mainers
regarding
transportation
access,
which
needs
to
be
noted.
Nearly
all
communities
in
our
state
have
a
crippling
dependence
on
cars.
There
are
no
adequate
public
transit
options,
our
communities
have
become
unwalkable,
and
alternative
transportation
such
as
biking
is
unsafe
on
most
streets.
This
has
created
major
barriers
to
transportation
for
our
youth.
For
those
younger
than
16,
they
have
limited
mobility ,
relying
mostly
on
parents
and
others
to
drive
them
to
where
they
need
to
be,
and
that
can
be
a
huge
ask.
Some
parents
work
long
hours
and
it
is
impractical
to
balance
their
kids’
schedules
with
theirs.
On
a
more
personal
note,
I
grew
up
in
a
family
of
7
and
understand
that
struggle.
My
dad
works
very
long
hours,
so
it
was
my
mom
that
would
have
to
balance
her
work
schedule
with
the
schedules
of
5
children.
When
I
was
actually
talking
to
her
this
morning
about
LD
1559,
she
said
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
helpful
to
have
adequate
public
transit,
especially
when
my
sisters
started
working
their
summer
jobs.
Now ,
for
young
adults
in
their
20s,
these
barriers
to
transportation
have
deeper
ef fects.
W ith
no
feasible
alternative
to
cars,
young
adults
are
heavily
restricted
in
seeking
better
job

opportunities,
higher
education,
basic
amenities
and
so
on.
Furthermore,
if
young
adults
were
able
to
secure
a
car ,
it
becomes
an
incredibly
high
cost
burden.
In
fact,
according
to
AAA,
the
cost
of
owning
a
car
is
on
average
$894
monthly
.
This
means
that
if
one
worked
at
the
state’ s
minimum
wage
for
40
hours/week,
52
weeks/year ,
transportation
costs
would
account
for
37%
of
income.
Besides
the
major
transportation
barriers,
the
youth
are
also
being
threatened
by
the
climate
crisis.
As
you
all
are
aware
of,
ef fects
from
climate
change
are
fueled
by
greenhouse
gas
emissions.
Moreover ,
in
Maine,
54%
of
GHG
emissions
come
from
the
transportation
sector ,
which
is
driven
by
our
dependence
on
gas
powered
vehicles.
In
fact,
78%
of
Mainers
commute
to
work
alone
,
which
is
the
highest
emitting
mode
of
transportation.
W e
need
to
have
transformative
solutions
to
reducing
our
transportation
emissions,
and
they
can
not
be
solely
solved
by
the
electrification
of
vehicles.
This
is
what
makes
LD
1559
really
important
for
the
youth
of
our
state.
It
significantly
expands
investment
in
public
transit,
not
just
in
urban
areas
like
Greater
Portland
or
Biddeford/Saco,
but
also
in
rural
regions
as
well.
This
bill
would
expand
coverage,
increase
frequency ,
among
other
much
needed
improvements
to
make
it
a
reliable
option.
It
also
provides
critical
assistance
for
transit
planning
in
communities,
as
well
as
a
robust
Public
T ransit
Advisory
Council
that
truly
represents
stakeholders.
The
initiatives
in
LD
1559
are
critical
for
youth
to
have
access
to
job
opportunities,
higher
education,
and
overall
mobility .
It
also
will
be
an
ef fective
measure
to
reduce
our
emissions,
which
is
one
of
the
responsibilities
for
this
committee
and
the
legislature.
One
last
thing
I
would
like
to
note:
this
investment
is
made
for
our
future.
It
will
impact
my
generation
when
we
are
adults,
have
jobs,
have
families
and
so
on.
Therefore,
when
you
consider
your
position
on
LD
1559,
please
take
into
account
that
it
is
your
responsibility
to
determine
the
outcome
of
my
generation’ s
future.
As
such,
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1559.
I
thank
you
for
your
time
and
service.
