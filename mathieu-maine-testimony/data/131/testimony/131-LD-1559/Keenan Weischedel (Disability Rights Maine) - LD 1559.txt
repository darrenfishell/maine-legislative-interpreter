Re: L.D. 1559, An Act to Advance the State’s Public Transit Systems by 
Reinvigorating the Public Transit Advisory Council and Increasing 
Funding 
 
Dear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
 
My name is Keenan Weischedel and I am an advocate at Disability Rights 
Maine, Maine’s 
Protection and Advocacy agency for people with disabilities, testifying in 
support of LD 1559 on behalf of DRM and the clients we serve. I am also an 
individual with a disability and have experience navigating public transit 
systems in Maine. 
 

Too often people with disabilities don’t have access to means of 
transportation that many Mainer’s take for granted. Some people with 
disabilities depend on public transportation to access their communities. Bill 
LD 1559 would allow for Maine public transit systems to continue providing 
and improve their services. 
 
LD 1559 require the reinvigorating Public Transit Advisory Council to have a 
stakeholder representing people with disabilities. This is necessary as people 
with disabilities are often left out of conversations that relate to their needs. 
The Council would allow a voice for this community to ensure that transit 
providers continue to serve people with disabilities in the best way possible. 
 
Currently, many public transit systems are dependent on funding that is 
about to expire. LD 1559 would provide funding to local transit providers 
to ensure they can continue operating in the same manner as they have 
been. If transit systems lose their funding, it will drastically impact 
people with disabilities who depend on these transit providers. 
 
Disability Rights Maine supports LD 1599 and encourages the 
committee to pass this bill. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Keenan Weischedel, Adcocate
