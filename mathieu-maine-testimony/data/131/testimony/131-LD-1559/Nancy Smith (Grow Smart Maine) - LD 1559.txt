I-Tm r1rim.s' Testixnony of Nancy Smith, Executive Director of ’GrowSmart Maine 
In support of LD 1559 "An Act to Advance the State's Public Transit Systems 
by Reinvigorating the Public Transit Advisory Council and Increasing 
Funding" 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation 
My name is Nancy Smith, I live in Ellsworth, and I am the CEO of GrowSInart Maine. 
We are a statewide non-partisan non-proﬁt organization helping communities navigate 
change in alignment with smart growth. We advocate for comprehensive policies and 
funding for smart growth practices and outcomes. 
We have partnered with Build Maine to guide a transparent crowd-sourcing of policy 
proposals that began a year ago, and has drawn together over a hundred people from 
across Maine and beyond. This testimony represents the view of Build Maine as well as 
GrowSmart Maine. 
Policy Action 2023 has resulted in sixteen proposals from eight working groups, all 
addressing this goal, “to address barriers to and create incentives for 
equitable, sustainable growth and development that strengthens 
downtowns and villages of all sizes while pulling development pressure 
away from productive and open natural areas. We do so acknowledging 
that Maine has urban, rural, and suburban settings for which any 
solution may or may not be a ﬁt and a variety of people who deserve to be 
welcomed to their communities. ” 
LD 1559 is the outcome of a months—long collaborative process within the working 
group focused on reworking transportation funding to address unmet needs across 
Maine, in urban and rural communities. As you can see in the attached Fact Sheet, there 
are many arguments in favor of this legislation, because it will add value throughout 
Maine in economic development, climate action, ﬁscal health, transportation safety and 
choice, and quality of life. 
We realize the ﬁscal note will be signiﬁcant, but we also believe this to be a sound 
investment in all those aspects of living and working in Maine. 
GrowSmart Maine and Build Maine will assist the committee in any way that is helpful.

OVERVIEW: What does the bill do? 
The proposal will reinvigorate and invest in Maine's public 
transit system. lt overall improves and strengthens the role 
of the state in order to support local transit operators, 
employers, commuters and our climate goals. There are 
numerous measures, which include the following: 
0 The bill strengthens the Public Transit Advisory 
Council (PTAC). The PTAC is a statewide group 
intended to assess current level of service and 
recommend improvements. This bill expands the 
role of the PTAC, while also diversifying its 
representation by adding members in labor, 
immigrant communities and youth climate 
activism. It also calls for an additional transit 
operator. Additionally, the bill expands the role of 
the PTAC to develop a statewide plan, address 
how to achieve the standards of adequate access; 
develops a statewide mobility management 
program, improve coordination of transit systems 
for mobility needs; and submit a report to MeDOT 
for anticipated statewide transit funding. 
0 The bill provides a one time appropriation of 
$25M. This investment will supplement the 
operating and capital needs for transit operators 
within the current transit plan, create a mobility 
management program, and expand transit 
planning assistance for rural communities. 
0 The bill provides a one time appropriation of 
$13.6M. As federal operating subsidies for transit 
expire this year, this appropriation will make sure 
that transit operates at its current level of service. 
0 Amends the Sensible Transportation Policy Act. 
This act guides MeDOT decision-making on 
transportation planning, capital investment and 
project decisions. The act is amended to include 
commitments to expanded public transit, as well 
as Maine's climate goals. , ..\ . ,,, *

PROS: 
I Makes transit accessible, affordable & convenient. 
0 Advances climate goals by reducing GHG emissions. 
O Promotes equity, as it expands job opportunities and 
addresses mobility issues. 
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES: 
0 The ﬁscal note is bold when compared to the 
status quo. This will be a hurdle in budget 
negotiations and may be a deterrent for folks that 
advocate for reduced government spending. 
IMPACTS: Why does it matter? 
Equity: Expands access to job opportunities, basic 
amenities, and places around the state. It also decreases 
car dependence, which is a major barrier to transportation 
access. 
Transportation Safety and Choice: Public transit 
commuters face far lower crash rates and have a traffic 
casualty rate about a tenth of the automobiles rate. 
Climate Action: Public transit use reduces emissions 
signiﬁcantly, especially with the rise of electric buses. 
Fiscal health: Public transit is signiﬁcantly cheaper in 
comparison to a car. Car expenses can be on average 
$894 monthly, while bus transit monthly passes on 
average cost 558.53.» 
Economic Development: Public transit expands 
access to local downtowns and businesses. it 
connects commuters to better job opportunities, which 
beneﬁts both employers and employees.. 
Quality of Life: Improved public transit means that people 
have access to healthier foods, vital services, better 
employment, and recreational activities. This means more 
socioeconomic mobility, a key to better quality of life. 
Moreover, public transit further connects people to others in 
their community.
