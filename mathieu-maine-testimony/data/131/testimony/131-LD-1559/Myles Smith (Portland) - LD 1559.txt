Hello Chairman Chipman, Chairwoman Williams, and fellow members of the 
Transportation Committee,
My name is Myles Smith, and I am a resident of Portland. My family of four is a 
one-car household, which is possible only in Portland thanks to its walkability and 
public transportation - and it's still barely feasible. We need better public 
transportation to connect the state for so many reasons. 
Every time I take the train or bus for a work meeting in Biddeford, to meet friends in 
Boston or family in Freeport, I'm saving our state money, saving our environment, 
and reducing traffic on our highways. So many more people would make this choice 
this if we had better public transit. 
I also think about the folks I see using our miserable bus system. In Auburn, where 
immigrants are housed in a hotel at the outskirts of town that is outside the reach of 
the public busses. In Portland, where I've seen folks waiting to transit across multiple 
bus lines to get from the discount grocery store by 95 back to their homes. And to the 
folks who, for health reasons or choices, can't use a bike to fill in the gaps in the 
public transit grid like I can. I would love to see a future where my kids could take a 
bus to see their grandparents in Durham or their great grandparents in South Paris. 
This bill would help pave the way to a future - and the future of our health and 
wellbeing depends on moving away from private cars.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Myles Smith
