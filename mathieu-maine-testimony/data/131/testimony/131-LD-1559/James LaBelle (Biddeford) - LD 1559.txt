LD 1559
I would like to express my support for LD1559 and the specific requests as part of it 
to move our public transportation capabilities forward.  As Executive Director of the 
Biddeford & Saco Chamber of Commerce, I see first-hand the many challenges that 
local residents have in gaining meaningful employment, and the ongoing challenge 
that our local employers face in trying to grow their workforce.  A core employment 
barrier is the ability to commute regularly and cost effectively to places of 
employment.  For Maine to achieve not only our employment goals but also our 
critical climate change reduction goals, more robust public transportation options and 
in particular options that help employers gainfully employ more people will be 
crucial.
