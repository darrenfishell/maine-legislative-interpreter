[¶ 1] Marie Robichaud appeals from a judgment entered 
in the District Court (Bangor, Gunther, J. ) dismissing 
Robichaud’s petition for grandparent visitation *1214  
rights. Robichaud contends the District Court erred by (1) 
finding she did not have standing to petition, (2) not 
holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits, and (3) not addressing the constitutionality of 19–A M.R.S.A. § 
1803(1)(B) or 1803 (1)(C) (1998). Pariseau asserts that (1) 
Robichaud failed to show an “urgent reason” existed to 
support her petition; (2) without the “urgent reasons” 
prerequisite for standing shown, the court appropriately 
dismissed her petition without an evident iary hearing; and 
(3) if the court applied section 1803(1)(C)  in the manner 
requested by Robichaud, the “urgent reason”  prerequisite 
would be ignored and the statute would be 
unconstitutional. We disagree with Robichaud and affirm 
the District Court’s decision.  
  
 
 
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 2] Pariseau and Francis Sprague have three children: a 
daughter, 4, a son, 2, and a daughter, 1. Pariseau and 
Sprague live separately from each other. Sprague is 
subject to a protection from abuse order limiting his 
contact with Pariseau and the children. After Spragu e was 
arrested for a series of burglaries in March 2002, Pariseau 
prohibited Sprague from further contact with the children.  
  
[¶ 3] In April 2002, Robichaud, Francis Sprague’s 
mother, filed a petition in the District Court seeking 
grandparent visitation r ights pursuant to the Grandparents 
Visitation Act, 19–A M.R.S.A. §§ 1801 –1805 (1998 & 
Supp.2002) , after Pariseau denied her access to the 
children.1 Robichaud’s af fidavit accompanying her 
petition generally described her relationship with the 
grandchildren. Pariseau responded by filing a motion to 
dismiss Robichaud’s petition.  
 1 
 Sprague did not object to Robichaud’s petition for 
visitation rights.  
 
 
[¶ 4] Although the motion to dismiss was pending and the 
Grandparents Visitation Act requires the court to make a 
preliminary determination of whether the required 
affidavits demonstrate a sufficient relationship to proceed 
with the action, the court made no  preliminary 
determination in this case. Instead, four months after the 
action was filed, the clerk scheduled a hearing before a 
Case Management Officer. The Case Management 
Officer then required the parties to attend a mediation 
session and scheduled a fu rther hearing before the Case 
Management Officer. After the mediation session, the 
Judge appropriately intervened to begin the preliminary 
consideration of Robichaud’s petition.

[¶ 5] The District Court provisionally granted Pariseau’s 
motion to dismiss after reviewing Robichaud’s affidavit. 
The court found Robichaud’s affidavit was non -specific, 
and determined that Robichaud failed to satisfy the 
“urgent reasons” standard set forth in Rideout v. 
Riendeau,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 24, 761 A.2d 291, 301.  The 
court, however, gave Robichaud an opportunity to 
supplement her affidavit prior to finalizing its decision.  
  
[¶ 6] In Robi chaud’s supplemental affidavit, she describes 
occasional visits with the grandchildren lasting from one 
day to one week over three and one -half years, intermixed 
with several periods of daily contact with the two older 
children. The court found Robichaud’s  contacts typified 
“those that one would anticipate from a connected, 
extended family.” The court concluded that Robichaud 
failed to meet the “urgent reasons” standard articulated in 
Rideout,  and dismissed her complaint with prejudice. This 
appeal followed . 
  
 
 
II. DISCUSSION  
[¶ 7] In Rideout,  2000 ME 198, 761 A.2d 291,  we 
explained that the Grandparents *1215  Visitation Act 
implicates parents’ fundamental rights, thereby triggering 
strict scrutiny and requiring the proponent of such 
visitation to demonstrate a unique relationship with the 
subject of the request for visitation. Id. ¶¶ 19 –24. We 
found the facts presented in Rideout  demonstrated a 
compelling state interest in allowing visitation because 
the grandparents had been primary caregivers and 
custodians to their grandchildren, assuming the role of 
parental figures to the o ldest two of three grandchildren 
for their first several years of life. Id. ¶¶ 4, 25, 27. 
Limiting our analysis to subsection 1803(1)(B), id. ¶ 17, 
we concluded that when grandparents have such a 
relationship with their grandchildren, the grandparents 
have  a “sufficient existing relationship” and there are 
“urgent reasons” for State interference with parents’ basic 
right to care and control of their children. Id. ¶¶ 25 –27. 
  
 [¶ 8] We interprete d the Act, however, as requiring 
certain safeguards.2 Id. ¶ 29. The first safeguard -and the 
only relevant safeguard to our analysis of Robichaud’s 
appeal -requires a grandparent to establish standing before 
litigation may commence for visitation rights, pursuant to 
subsections 1803(1) and 1803(2)(A) –(C).3 Id. Standing is 
established, pursuant to subsection 1803(1)(B), wh en 
grandparents prove they have a sufficient relationship that supports an “urgent reason” to interfere with a fit parent’s 
fundamental right. Id. ¶¶ 24 –25, 30.  
 2 
 The safeguards include that: (1) “a grandparent must 
establish standing before  litigation may commence on a 
petition,” (2) “ the court must consider any objection of 
the parents concerning an award of rights of visitation 
or access by the grandparents” (giving life to the 
presumption that parents act in the best interests of their 
children), and (3) “the court may not grant visi tation if 
doing so would significantly interfere with any 
parent -child relationship or with the parent’s rightful 
authority over the child.” Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 29, 
761 A.2d at 302 .

 Section 1803  provides, in pertinent part:  
§ 1803 . Petition  
1. Standing to petition for visitation rights.  A 
grandparent of a minor child may petition the court 
for reasonable rights of visitation or access if:  
A. At least one of the child’s parents or legal 
guardians has died;  
B. There is a sufficient existing relationship 
between the grandparent and the child; or  
C. When a sufficient existing relationship between 
the grandparent and the child does not exist, a 
sufficient effort to establish one has been made.  
2. Procedure.  The fo llowing procedures apply to 
petitions for rights of visitation or access under 
subsection 1, paragraph B or C.  
A. The grandparent must file with the petition for 
rights of visitation or access an affidavit alleging a 
sufficient existing relationship with t he child, or 
that sufficient efforts have been made to establish 
a relationship with the child. When the petition 
and accompanying affidavit are filed with the 
court, the grandparent shall serve a copy of both 
on at least one of the parents or legal guardi ans of 
the child.  
B. The parent or legal guardian of the child may 
file an affidavit in response to the grandparent’s 
petition and accompanying affidavit. When the 
affidavit in response is filed with the court, the 
parent or legal guardian shall deliver a copy to the 
grandparent.  
C. The court shall determine on the basis of the 
petition and the affidavit whether it is more likely 
than not that there is a sufficient existing 
relationship or, if a sufficient relationship does not 
exist, that a sufficient effo rt to establish one has 
been made.  
 
 
 [¶ 9] In proceedings of this sort, the court should 
promptly address the standing question after the parent 
files his or her answer and/or motion to dismiss. See 19–A 
M.R.S.A. § 1803 (2). Until this preliminary standing 
question is resolved to allow the grandparents’ action to

 proceed, no case management conferences and *1216  
related hearings or court ordered mediation sessions 
should be scheduled. See id.  
  
 [¶ 10] Robichaud first contends t he District Court erred 
by finding she did not have standing to bring her petition 
under the Act. Rideout’s  “urgent reasons” standard 
presupposes extraordinary contact between a grandparent 
and grandchildren to satisfy the constitutional requirement 
of a c ompelling state interest to interfere with parents’ 
right to care for and control their children. See Rideout,  
2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 24 –27, 761 A.2d at 301 –02. 
Robichaud’s contact with her grandchildren was not 
extraordinary. The contacts Robichaud described in her 
affidavits exemplify a pattern of intermittent contact with 
the grandchildren. Unlike the relationship found in 
Rideout,  Robichaud has not presented facts to indicate an 
urgent reason to maintain Robichaud’s contact with her 
grandchildren. See id.  ¶¶ 25 –26. On the facts presented by 
Robichaud in her affidavits, the District Court did not err 
by dismissing t he petition because Robichaud failed to 
present facts that indicate she has standing to petition 
pursuant to the Act. See id.  ¶ 30.  
  
 [¶ 11] Robichaud’s second  contention is that the District 
Court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing. 
Grandparents do not have a common law or constitutional 
right of access to their grandchildren. Id. ¶ 26 n. 16. 
Therefore, the only means grandparents have to petition for visitation rights is the Act, which requires standing to 
bring a petition. See id.  ¶¶ 26 n. 16, 29 –30. The court is 
charged with making the threshold determination of 
whether grandparents have standing, based upon the facts 
set forth in their petition and affidavits. See 19–A 
M.R.S.A. § 1803(1), 1803 (2)(A) –(C); Rideout,  2000 ME 
198, ¶¶ 29 –30, 761 A.2d at 302 –03. Robichaud failed to 
prove she is “among those grandparents who may pursue 
visits under the Act [,]” thus the court properly dismissed 
the petition without an evidentiary hearing. See id.  ¶ 30.  
  
[¶ 12] Robichaud’s final contention is that the District 
Court erred by not addressing the constitutionality of 
subsections 1803(1)(B) or 1803(1)(C) as applied or 
requested. Because we conclude that the Act does not 
apply to the facts presented by  Robichaud’s appeal, we do 
not reach the issue of whether the Act is constitutional as 
applied to her facts.
