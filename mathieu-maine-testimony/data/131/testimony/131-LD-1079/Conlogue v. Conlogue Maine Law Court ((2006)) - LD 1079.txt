DANA, J.  
 
[¶ 1] Herschel and Jane Conlogue appeal from a judgment 
entered in the District Court (Houlton, O’Mara, J. ) 
dismissing their petition under section 1803  of the 
Grandparent s Visitation Act, 19–A M.R.S. §§ 1801 –1805 
(2005) .1 They argue that the court erred (1) in concluding 
that the Act’s grant of standin g to grandparents *693  
when one parent has died, id. § 1803(1)(A), is 
unconstitutional; and (2) in its award of costs, including 
attorney fees, to Patricia Conlogue. We affirm the court’s 
dismissal of the petition on due  process grounds, but we 
vacate the award of costs and fees.  
 1 
 At the time of the grandparents’ petition, the statute 
provided, in relevant part:  
§ 1803 . Petition  
1. Standing to petition for visitation rights. A 
grandparent of a minor child may petition the court 
for reasonable rights of visitation or access if:  
A. At least one of the child’s parents or legal 
guardians has died;  
B. There is a sufficient existing relationship 
between the grandparent and the child; or  
C. When a sufficient existing relationship between 
the grandparent and the child does not exist, a 
sufficient effort to establish one has been made.  
2. Procedure. The following procedures apply to 
petitions for rights of visitation or access under 
subsection 1, paragraph B or C.  
A. The grandparent must file with the petition for 
rights of visitation or access an affidavit alleging a 
sufficient existing relationship with the child, or 
that sufficient efforts have been made to establish 
a relationship with the child. When the petition 
and accompanying affidavit are filed with the 
court, the grandparent sha ll serve a copy of both 
on at least one of the parents or legal guardians of 
the child.  
B. The parent or legal guardian of the child may 
file an affidavit in response to the grandparent’s 
petition and accompanying affidavit. When the 
affidavit in response is filed with the court, the 
parent or legal guardian shall deliver a copy to the 
grandparent.  
C. The court shall determine on the basis of the 
petition and the affidavit whether it is more likely 
than not that there is a sufficient existing 
relationship o r, if a sufficient relationship does not 
exist, that a sufficient effort to establish one has

 been made.  
D. If the court’s determination under paragraph C 
is in the affirmative, the court shall hold a hearing 
on the grandparent’s petition for reasonable ri ghts 
of visitation or access and shall consider any 
objections the parents or legal guardians may have 
concerning the award of rights of visitation or 
access to the grandparent. The standard for the 
award of reasonable rights of visitation or access is 
provided in subsection 3.  
3. Best interest of the child. The court may grant a 
grandparent reasonable rights of visitation or access 
to a minor child upon finding that rights of visitation 
or access are in the best interest of the child and 
would not signific antly interfere with any 
parent -child relationship or with the parent’s rightful 
authority over the child. In applying this standard, 
the court shall consider the following factors ....  
19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(1) -(3) (1998) . A recent change 
to section 1803(2)(D) , see P.L.2005, ch. 360, § 3, is not 
relevant to this appeal.  
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 2] Kevin and Patricia Conlogue were married and had 
one daughter, born in 2000. Kevin died in 2003. In June 
2004, Kevin’s parents, Herschel and Jane (the 
grand parents), filed a petition under the Act, seeking 
court -ordered visitation with their granddaughter. Patricia 
filed a motion to dismiss because the grandparents had 
not filed an affidavit pursuant to section 1803(2)(A)  of the 
Act alleging facts that would establish their standing 
under section 1803(1)(B) or (C) . Patricia withdrew her 
motion when the grandparents objected that they were 
proceeding under section 1803(1)(A) , which gives 
grandparents standing to file a petition when  “[a]t least 
one of the child’s parents or legal guardians has died” and 
does not require the filing of an affidavit.2 
 2 
 For reasons that are not clear from the record, the 
grandparents later filed an affidavit detailing their 
relationship with their granddaughter. As they have 
continued to rely exclusively on section 1803(1)(A)  to 
establish their standing, we do not consider this 
affidavit. Nor do we address the issue, not argued by 
the parties before the trial court or on appeal, of 
whether the grandparents might have standing under 
subsections (1)(B) or (C).  
 
[¶ 3] Patricia then filed a second motion to dismiss on 
constitutional grounds and a motion for costs and fees, 
with a supporting affidavit setting forth her attorney fees 
of $1133.30. She later filed a second affidavit with 
information about her financial situation. The 
grandparents opposed both motions but did not file a 
financial affidavit. The court held a hearing in November 2004 at which it heard argument on the motion to dismiss. 
The grandparents’ attorney then asked that t he court defer 
ruling on the motion for costs and fees until a final 
hearing and that “if you want financial information from 
[the grandparents], that I have fourteen days to do that.” 
The court replied, “[W]hat I’m going to do on that —that 
motion is defer  it until a final hearing, if there is one.... 
So, on the motion for fees, that is deferred.” The 
grandparents did not submit any financial information 
following the hearing.  
  
[¶ 4] In January 2005, without holding an additional 
hearing, the court entered  an order granting both of 
Patricia’s motions. The order included an extensive 
analysis of the issues raised by the motion to dismiss, but 
the only discussion of the motion for fees and costs was 
the following: “After review of the pleadings, and fee 
affid avit, Respondent’s Motion for Costs is GRANTED, 
pursuant to [ 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(6) (1998)  ]. 
Respondent is awarded $1,000.00 for her attorney’s fees, 
execution to issue .” The grandparents then brought this 
appeal.  
II. DISCUSSION  
A. Constitutionality of 19–A M.R .S. § 1803(1)(A)  
1. Constitutional Issue on Appeal  
 [¶ 5] Patricia’s motion to dismiss contended that section 
1803(1)(A)  is unconstitutional *694  on its face and as 
applied under the due pr ocess and equal protection 
clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions. We 
need not address all of these issues. First, we do not 
address Patricia’s facial challenge to the statute. We note 
that nothing in the Act limits grandparent visitation 
petitions to situations where the child is in the custody of 
a biological or adoptive parent. To find section 
1803(1)(A)  is unconstitutional on its face, we would need 
to co nclude that there are no circumstances in which it 
would be valid. United States v. Salerno,  481 U.S. 739, 
745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) , cited in In re 
Heather C.,  2000 ME 99, ¶ 20, n. 7, 751 A.2d 448, 454.  
To do this, we would need to explore the very d ifferent 
issues that would be raised by a petition to require 
visitation against the wishes of a nonparent custodian 
such as a legal guardian. Because this case can be 
resolved on an as -applied basis, we have no reason to 
address such issues.  
  
[¶ 6] Secon d, we do not address the validity of the statute 
under the Maine Constitution. Patricia has not argued that 
the Maine due process and equal protection clauses 
Conlogue v. Conlogue, 890 A.2d 691 (2006)   
2006 ME 12

 provide her with any greater protection than their federal 
counterparts, cf. Carroll F. Look Constr. Co. v. Town of 
Beals,  2002 ME 128, ¶ 17, 802 A.2d 994, 999  (stating that 
federal and Maine due  process rights are coextensive); 
Botting v. Dep’t of Behavioral & Developmental Servs.,  
2003 ME 152, ¶ 23, 838 A.2d 1168, 1176  (stating that 
federal and Maine equal protection rights are 
coextensive), and the parties have not pressed any state 
constitutional arguments on appeal. Finally, our 
disposition of Patricia’s due process argument makes it 
unnecessary for us to address her equal protection 
argument. Our discussion is thus confined to the issue of 
whether section 1803(1)(A) , as applied in this case, 
violates  Patricia’s federal due process rights.3 
 3 
 In addition, we construe Patricia’s due process 
argument  to be confined to substantive due process, and 
so do not consider any procedural due process issues. 
See In re Amberley D.,  2001 ME 87, ¶¶ 11 –12, 775 
A.2d 1158, 1163 . 
 
2. Troxel  and Rideout  
[¶ 7] Our analysis of this question begins with the 
decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. 
Granville,  530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 
(2000) , and of this Court in Rideout v. Riendeau,  2000 
ME 198, 761 A.2d 291.  Although in neither case was a 
single opinion joined by the majority of the court,4 the 
plurality opinions in both cases offer significant guidance 
on the substantive due proces s implications of a statute 
providing for court -ordered grandparent visitation.  
 4 
 In Troxel,  Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion was 
joined by three other justices; two justices filed 
opinions concurring in the judgment; and three justices 
filed dissenting opinions. In Rideout,  Justice Saufley’s 
plurality opinio n was joined by two other justices; two 
justices joined in an opinion concurring in the result; 
one justice filed a dissenting opinion; and one justice 
did not participate.  
 
[¶ 8] In Troxel,  the Supreme Court considered an order 
granting visitation to the paternal grandparents of two 
girls whose father was deceased, over the objections of 
their mother. 530 U.S. at 60 –61, 1 20 S.Ct. 2054.  The 
Washington statute at issue allowed a court to grant 
visitation to any person at any time if the court found 
visitation to be in the best interest of the child. Id. at 61, 
120 S.Ct. 2054.  The Supreme Court affirmed the 
judgment of the state supreme court holding the statute to 
be unconstitutional. Id. at 63, 120 S.Ct. 2054.  Justice 
O’Connor ’s plurality opinion concluded that the statute, 
as applied, *695  violated the mother’s fundamental 
substantive due process right to make decisions 
concerning the care, custody, and control of her children. Id. at 72, 75, 120 S.Ct. 2054.  This conclusion rested on 
the “sweeping breadth”  of the statute and the fact that the 
trial court had applied a presumption in favor of 
grandparent visitation rather than deferring to the 
mother’s judgment on whether visitation was in the best 
interest of the children. Id. at 67 –73, 120 S.Ct. 2054.  
According to the plurality, such a decision by a fit parent 
must be given “special weight,” and can only be 
interfered with by the state on a showing of “special 
factors.” Id. at 68 –69, 120 S.Ct. 2054.  The plurality 
declined to decide whether such special factors are limited 
to harm or potential harm to the child, because there were 
no special factors present that co uld justify the trial 
court’s order of visitation.5 Id. at 73, 120 S.Ct. 2054 . 
 5 
 Justice Saufley’s plurality opinion in Rideout  includes a 
more extensive discussion of Troxel. See Rideout v. 
Riendeau,  2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 7 –12, 18, 26 & n. 16, 
30–31, 761 A.2d 291, 295 –97. 
 
 
[¶ 9] In Rideout,  this Court examined the constitutionality 
of court -ordered visitation under the Maine Act in a 
situation where the grandparents asserted standing 
pursuant to 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(1)(B) (1998)  based on 
a “sufficient existing relationship” with their 
grandchildren. 2000 ME 198, ¶ 17, 761 A.2d at 299.  The 
District Court found that the grandparents met the 
statutory criteria and would be entitled to visitation, but 
held the Act to be unconstitutional and so dismissed the 
petition. Id. ¶ 6, 761 A.2d at 295.  We vacated the 
judgment and remanded for further proceedings. Id. ¶ 34, 
761 A.2d at 303 . 
  
[¶ 10] Justice Saufley’s plurality opinion upheld the Act 
as applied against the parents’ substantive due process 
challenge. Id. ¶ 33, 761 A.2d at 303.  Because an order of 
visitation against the parents’ wishes infringes upon a 
fundamental right that is well -established in Maine and 
federal precedent, the statute had to withstand strict 
scrutiny, which requires that the infringement be narrowly 
tailored to serve a compelling state inte rest. Id. ¶¶ 18 –20, 
761 A.2d at 299 –300. The plurality concluded that a 
compelling state interest in inter fering with the 
decision -making of a fit parent may exist not only when 
there is a threat of “harm” to the child, narrowly defined, 
but also when other “urgent reasons” are present. Id. ¶¶ 
23–24, 761 A.2d at 300 –01. One such urgent reason is the 
preservation of an existing relationship between 
grandparents and grandchildren when the grandparents 
functioned as parents to the children for a significant 
period of time, as the Rideouts alleged that they had done. 
Id. ¶¶ 25 –27, 761 A.2d at 301 –02. 
  
[¶ 11] The plurality next considered whether the Act was 
Conlogue v. Conlogue, 890 A.2d 691 (2006)   
2006 ME 12  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  4 
 narrowly tailored to serve this compelling interest, and 
conclude d that it was. Id. ¶¶ 29, 33, 761 A.2d at 302 –03. 
In sharp contrast to the statute at issue in Troxel,  the 
Maine Act contains multiple layers of protections before 
grandparent visitation can be ordered: the grandparent 
must first establish standing; the court must consider the 
parent’s objections; and the court may order visitation 
only if it would not signific antly interfere with the 
parent -child relationship or the parent’s rightful authority. 
Id. ¶¶ 29 –32, 761 A.2d at 302 –03. The plurality thus 
concluded that the Act could be applied without violating 
the parents’ constitutional rights.6 Id. ¶ 33, 761 A.2d at 
303. 
 6 
 Chief Justice Wathen, joined by Justice Rudman, 
concurred only in the result. Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 
35–46, 761 A.2d at 304 –08. Their view was that only a 
facial challenge was at issue and that the Act was not 
facially unconstitutional. Id. ¶ 46, 761 A.2d at 308.  
Justice Alexander dissented, concluding that the Act 
violated the parents’ due process rights. Id. ¶¶ 47 –70, 
761 A.2d at 308 –13. 
 
*696  3. Rights at Issue and Level of Scrutiny  
 [¶ 12] It is well established that, pursuant to the 
substantive due process component of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, parents have a fundamental liberty interest 
in making decisions concerning the care, custody, and 
control of their children. E.g., Santosky v. Kramer,  455 
U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) ; In 
re Scott S.,  2001 ME 114, ¶ 20 n. 12, 775 A.2d 1144, 
1151.  It follows that a court order requiring grandparent 
visitation against the wishes of a parent constitutes an 
infringement of that fundamental right. Troxel,  530 U.S. 
at 67, 120 S.Ct. 2054  (plurality); Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 
21, 761 A.2d at 300  (plurality). The Troxel  plurality did 
not articulate the level of sc rutiny by which such an 
infringement should be tested. See 530 U.S. at 65 –75, 120 
S.Ct. 2054.  The Rideout  plurality applied strict scrutiny. 
2000 ME 198, ¶ 19, 761 A.2d at 300;  see also id. ¶ 53, 
761 A.2d at 309  (Alexander, J., dissenting). That 
approach followed the general principles set forth in 
previous Supreme Court decisions, see, e.g., Reno v. 
Flores,  507 U.S. 292, 301 –02, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 
L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) , and in Justice Thomas’s Troxel  
concurrence, 530 U.S. at 80, 120 S.Ct. 2054,  and is 
consistent with more recent decisions of several other 
state courts, e.g., Harold v. Collier,  107 Ohio St.3d 44, 
836 N.E.2d 1165, 1171 (2005) ; Blixt v. Blixt,  437 Mass. 
649, 774 N.E.2d 1052, 1059 (2002) ; Roth v. Weston,  259 
Conn. 202, 789 A.2d 431, 441 (2002) . 
  
[¶ 13] The application of strict scrutiny in Rideout  is not 
necessarily controlling here, however. To determine the proper level of scrutiny in this case, we must focus on the 
exact imposition on Patricia’s rights that is at issue. 
Section 1803(1)(A)  does not force Patricia to allow 
visitation. It forces her, rather, to litigate the question of 
visitation, which would then be decided by the trial court 
(presumably after a hearing)7 applying the statutory 
criteria in section 1803 (3). Whether we must apply strict 
scrutiny, therefore, depends on whether being forced to 
litigate a claim that may result in an infringement of a 
fundamental right itself  constitutes an infringement of that 
right. In this context, considering the impor tance of the 
right, we believe that it does. This conclusion appears to 
be supported by the plurality opinions in Troxel  and 
Rideout  as well as decisions from courts in other states.  
 7 
 Strictly speaking, the Act only requires the court to 
hold a hearing and consider the parent’ s objections 
when the grandparent has established standing under 
section 1803(1)(B) or (C) , not under subsection (1)(A). 
See 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(D) (2005) . We have no 
doubt, however, that a court applying the Act in light of 
Troxel  and Rideout  would not grant visitation over the 
objections of a custodial parent without holding a 
hearing  and considering those objections, regardless of 
the basis of the grandparent’s standing.  
 
 
[¶ 14] The Troxel  plurality’s conclusion that the 
Washington statute was unconstitutional as applied was 
based partially on the fact that the statute contained no 
limitation on who could file a third -party visitation 
petition. 530 U.S. at 67, 120 S.Ct. 20 54. The plurality also 
noted that “the burden of litigating a domestic relations 
proceeding can itself be ‘so disruptive of the parent -child 
relationship that the constitutional right of a custodial 
parent to make certain basic determinations for the ch ild’s 
welfare becomes implicated.’ ” Id. at 75, 120 S.Ct. 2054  
(quoting id. at 101, 120 S.Ct. 2054  (Kennedy, J., 
dissenting)). Similar concerns were voiced in Rideout.  
The plurality’s conclusion that the Maine *697  Act, as 
applied in that case, was narrowly tailored to serve a 
compelling state interest depended in part on the f act that 
the grandparents there were required to convince the court 
of their statutory standing by an initial showing of a 
“sufficient existing relationship” with their grandchildren, 
thus providing the parents with some “protection against 
the expense, st ress, and pain of litigation.” 2000 ME 198, 
¶¶ 26, 30, 761 A.2d at 301 –02. The grandparents’  
showing that they had functioned as parents to their 
grandchild gave the state a compelling interest in 
“providing a forum” in which the grandparents could 
litigate the visitation issue. Id. ¶¶ 26, 28, 761 A.2d at 
301–02. 
  
[¶ 15] Other courts have also suggested that the mere 
commencement of third -party visitation litigation can 
Conlogue v. Conlogue, 890 A.2d 691 (2006)   
2006 ME 12

 infringe a parent’s fundament al rights, and have adopted 
various threshold requirements for bringing such litigation 
when these were not provided by statute. The Connecticut 
Supreme Court stated that “[w]here fundamental rights 
are implicated ..., standing serves a function beyond a 
mere jurisdictional prerequisite. It also assures that the 
statutory scheme is narrowly tailored so that a person’s 
personal affairs are not needlessly intruded upon and 
interrupted by the trauma of litigation.” Roth,  789 A.2d at 
442. To save the constitutionality of the Connecticut 
statute, which contained no limits on standing, the court 
added a requirement th at “any third party, including a 
grandparent ..., seeking visitation must allege and 
establish a parent -like relationship as a jurisdictional 
threshold  in order ... to pass constitutional muster ....” Id. 
at 443  (emphasis added). The Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court similarly adopted a narrowing construction 
of the commonwealth’s grandparent visitat ion statute in 
response to a constitutional challenge. See Blixt,  774 
N.E.2d at 1060.  The court held that, because the usual 
requirements of notice pleading do not sufficiently protect 
a parent’s fundamental rights from the burden of 
potentially unwarranted litigation, a grandparent seeking 
visitation must make an initial showing of facts that 
would justify a visitation order by filing a complaint that 
is either detailed and verified or accompanied by a 
detailed affidavit. See id. at 1066;  accord Daniels v. 
Daniels,  381 N.J.Super. 286, 885 A.2d 524, 530 –31 
(2005) . The New Jersey Appellate Division shared the 
same concern that “the litig ation itself is a burden on the 
parent’s substantive due process rights. One can easily 
imagine circumstances in which that burden would be 
grave indeed.” Wilde v. Wilde,  341 N.J.Super. 381, 775 
A.2d 535, 544 (2001) . The court adopted a requirement 
that grandparents could not commence litigation until 
they had made substantial efforts to repair their 
relationship with the parent and their request for visitation 
had been denied with finality. See id. at 545.  
  
[¶ 16] Consistent with the analysis of the Troxel  and 
Rideout  pluralities, the decisions of these other courts, and 
the great importance of the rights at issue, we hold that 
forcing parents to defend against a claim for grandparent 
visitation is itself an infringement of their fundamental 
right to make decisions con cerning the custody and 
control of their children. Such an infringement is subject 
to strict scrutiny, and must be narrowly tailored to serve a 
compelling state interest. Flores,  507 U. S. at 301 –02, 113 
S.Ct. 1439;  Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 19, 761 A.2d at 
299–300 (plurality). Accor dingly, we must decide 
whether section 1803(1)(A) , granting the grandparents in 
this case standing to petition for visitation with their 
granddaughter because her father had died, serves a 
compelling state interest, and if so whether it is narrowly tailored to that purpose.  
*698  4. Compelling State Interest  
 [¶ 17] The Rideout  plurality addressed the question of 
what state interests are important enough to justify a 
court’s intrusion into family life pursuant to the Maine 
Act. Two points of reference are clear: on one hand, “the 
threat of harm to a child is certainly sufficient to provide 
the State with a compelling interest,” Rideout,  2000 ME 
198, ¶ 23, 761 A.2d at 300;  on the other, “something more 
than the best interest of the child must be at stake in order 
to establish a compelling state interest,” id. ¶ 23, 761 A.2d 
at 301.  In between these two poles, the plurality 
concluded that the State’s parens patriae interest can be 
compelling in this context when, even in th e absence of a 
threat of harm, there are “urgent reasons” that may justify 
court -ordered grandparent visitation. Id. ¶¶ 24 –25, 761 
A.2d at 301.  Maintaining a relationship between children 
and grandparents who had acted as the children’s parents 
for a significant period of time was such an urgent reason. 
Id. ¶¶ 25 –27, 761 A.2d at 301 –02. We subsequently 
approved the “urgent reasons” standard in a unanimous 
opinion in Robichaud v. Pariseau,  2003 ME 54, ¶¶ 8, 10, 
820 A.2d 1212, 1215 –16. We affirmed the denial of 
standin g to a grandmother whose affidavit pursuant to 
section 1803(1)(B)  had alleged facts only amounting to 
“intermittent contact” with her grandchildren, rather than 
the “extr aordinary contact” found in Rideout. Id. ¶ 10, 820 
A.2d at 1216 . Because the grandmother did no t make an 
initial showing of urgent reasons, the District Court was 
correct to dismiss the petition without holding an 
evidentiary hearing. Id. ¶ 11, 820 A.2d at 1216 . 
  
 [¶ 18] When a grandparent claims standing based on a 
“sufficient existing relationship”  or an effort to establish 
one, the Act provides a summary procedure for testing 
that claim that allows the court to examine the specific 
facts of the case and decide whether urgent reasons have 
been shown that justify imposing on the parent the 
burdens of  litigation. 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B) -(C), 
(2)(A) -(C). No such procedure exists when the 
grandparent claims standing under section 1803(1)(A)  
because one of the child’s parents has died. In effect, the 
Act adopts a per se rule that the fact of a parental death in 
itself justifies imposing on the surviving parent the burden 
of litigation t hat, as we have said above, itself infringes on 
the parent’s fundamental rights and may result in 
court -ordered visitation that more significantly infringes 
those rights. We do not see, however, how the fact of a 
parental death standing alone  can be an urg ent reason for 
a court’s interference in family life over the objections of 
a custodial parent like Patricia Conlogue. “Nothing in the 
unfortunate circumstance of one biological parent’s death 
affects the surviving parent’s fundamental right to make

102 Cal.Rptr.2d 476, 486 (2000) . 
  
[¶ 19] It is easy to envision situations in which section 
1803(1)(A)  would grant the grandparents standing even 
though the facts do not warrant litigation over visitation: 
for example, the deceased parent may have had no role in 
the child’s life, so that the death does little to alter the 
child’s situation; or a widow or w idower may have 
wonderful parenting support from relatives and friends, so 
that the children are in no sort of urgent circumstances, 
yet lack the financial resources to defend against a 
visitation petition by wealthier grandparents. When the 
grandparents p roceed under section 1803(1)(A) , the court 
has no way to know of such facts until it holds an 
evidentiary hearing, and its ability to deny visitation at 
that point in *699  the proceedings comes too late to fully 
protect the fundamental rights of the surviving parent. 
The possibility of an after -the-fact award of attorney fees 
is an insufficient remedy, in part because the parent may 
be in no position to pay an attorney up front and then 
hope for reimbursement, but also because the burdens of 
litigation are not solely financial, but include various 
forms of “pressures and stress” that can pose a real threat 
to family well -being. See Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 
55–56, 761 A.2d at 310  (dissenting opinion); see also id. 
¶ 30, 761 A.2d at 302  (plurality opinion) (noting that 
litigation causes expense, stress, and pain).  
  
[¶ 20] The grandparents argue that there is a compelling 
state interest in providing a forum for children who have 
been traumatized by the death of a parent to maintain or 
establish relationships with their grandparents. We agree 
that the maintenance or esta blishment of such a 
relationship may be in the best interest of the child, 
although protecting the best interest of a child is not itself 
a compelling state interest. See id. ¶ 23 & n. 15, 761 A.2d 
at 301  (plurality). In some cases there may even be 
“urgent reasons” to maintain or establish such a 
relationship, which would suffice in those cases to 
demo nstrate a compelling interest. But given the burden 
that section 1803(1)(A) ’s automatic grant of standing 
imposes on the surviving parent in every  case, we do not 
believe  that there can be a compelling interest in relieving 
grandparents of the modest burden of making an initial 
showing of the urgent reasons that justify their standing.  
  
[¶ 21] Similarly, the State, as amicus curiae, argues that 
there is a compelling state  interest in maintaining 
connections between a child and his deceased parent’s 
family. That may be true in some situations, for example 
when the parents of the deceased parent have functioned 
as parents to the child or are uniquely situated to protect the child from harm. Again, however, we cannot say that 
the state interest in maintaining such connections is so 
compelling that it must be recognized in every case, 
regardless of the particular facts.  
  
[¶ 22] We conclude that the death of one parent in itsel f is 
not an urgent reason that justifies forcing the surviving 
parent into litigation under the Act. Section 1803(1)(A)  
thus fails to serve a compelling state interest wh en it is 
applied to allow the deceased parent’s family to litigate 
visitation over the objection of a custodial parent like 
Patricia. Because there is no compelling state interest, we 
need not consider whether section 1803(1)(A)  is narrowly 
tailored. In the absence of a compelling state interest, 
forcing Patricia to defend against the grandparents’ 
visitation petition for the sole reason that her daughter’ s 
father is dead would violate her substantive due process 
rights. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in 
dismissing the petition.  
B. Award of Costs and Fees  
 [¶ 23] The grandparents argue that the court acted 
beyond its discretion in granting Patricia’s motion for 
costs and fees without holding a hearing or requesting 
them to submit a financial affidavit. The court acted 
pursuant to former 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803 (6) (1998), 
which provided: “6. Costs and fees. The court may award 
costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for defending 
or pro secuting actions under this chapter.” Subsection (6) 
was repealed, effective September 17, 2005, and replaced 
by new 19–A M.R.S. § 105(1) (2005) , which provides a 
general gr ant of authority to the court to award attorney 
fees and costs, after an opportunity for *700  hearing, in 
any action arising under title 19–A. P.L.2005, ch. 323, §§ 
1, 13.8 
 8 
 The new statute provides: “In an action under this Title , 
including actions to modify or enforce existing orders, 
the court may, after an opportunity for hearing, order a 
party, including a party in interest, to pay another party 
or another party’s attorney reasonable attorney’s fees, 
including costs, for parti cipation in the proceedings.” 
19–A M.R.S. § 105(1) (2005) . 
 
 [¶ 24] When authorized by statute, the decision whether 
to award attorney fees is committed to the sound 
discretion of the trial court. Dargie v. Dargie,  2001 ME 
127, ¶ 30, 778 A.2d 353, 360.  Such an award should be 
based on all relevant factors, including the relative 
capacity of the parties to absorb the costs of litigation. Id. 
¶ 31, 778 A.2d at 360.  Here the grandparents contend that 
the court abused that discretion by failing to give them an 
adequate opportunity  to contest the allegations in 
Patricia’s affidavit or to offer their own financial 
information. As described above, at the hearing the court 
Conlogue v. Conlogue, 890 A.2d 691 (2006)

 stated that it was deferring consideration of Patricia’s 
motion for costs and fees until the final hearing, if the re 
was one, and did not respond to the suggestion of the 
grandparents’ attorney that they be given two weeks to 
submit financial information. As Patricia points out, the 
grandparents could have submitted an affidavit without 
waiting for an explicit invitat ion from the court. After the 
hearing, however, they could have reasonably believed 
that it was unnecessary to do so at that point because the 
court would not grant the motion without giving them 
some further notice, either that it would hold an additional  
hearing or that it would decide the question without a 
hearing. See McCain Foods, Inc. v. Gervais,  657 A.2d 
782, 784 (Me.1995) . 
  
[¶ 25] In these circumstances, where there was at least a 
misunderstanding concerning the opportunity of the 
grandparents to oppose Patricia’s motion for costs and 
fees, we will vacate the court’s order granting the motion and remand for reconsideration, including consideration 
of the costs and fees incurred by Patricia in successfully 
defending this appeal. On remand the court should give 
the parties an opportunity to submit additional affidavits 
and for a hearing as provide d by the newly -adopted 
section 105(1) . 
  
The entry is:  
  
Judgment of dismissal affirmed. Order on costs and fees 
vacated. Remanded for further consideration of costs and 
fees.
