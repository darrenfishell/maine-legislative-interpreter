To whom it may concern,  
 
I am writing this letter in support of Maine Senate bill LD 1079 , An Act Regarding Visitation Rights Of 
Grandparents .  This bill is of particular importance to me as I am a grandfather to three young children, 
two of whom my wife and I have guardianship of.    
I believe grandparents play an integral role in the lives of their grandchildren ; particularly  now, more 
than ever , with the ongoing drug epidemic and mental health crisis.  Today’s grandparents are often a 
child ’s source of mental, emotional, and /or financial stability .  They offer a wealth of love and support 
crucial to a child’s well- being.   
I would agree tha t capable parents should always have the final say in the lives of their children.  
However, I believe ch ildren should never be used as weapons or bargaining chips when relationships 
between parents and grandparents go awry.  Though the resulting pain inflicted on adults is 
unfortunate, the impact of such trauma  on children is never accep table.  To deny the continuation of 
established, healthy relationships between children and their grandparents has lifelong, detrimental impact on children , impact easily avoided should this bill pass.   
In closing, it would be ideal if a judge were not needed to play adv ocate in these situations.  
Unfortunately, in our current culture, it has become necessary.  Adults are too often incapable of focusing on the best interest of children , which should always be the goal. I implore you to consider this 
bill for the benefit of today’s and future generations, as well as the grandparents who love them.  
 
Sincerely,
