To
Whom
It
May
Concern,
I’ve
been
in
education
for
many
years.
I’ve
seen
the
importance
first
hand
of
children
having
contact
and
a
relationship
with
their
grandparents.
Whether
it’s
a
function
at
school,
a
movie,
an
overnighter…
grandparents
are
vital
to
a
child’s
well
being
and
development.
Elementary
Schools
hold
many
special
events
that
include
grandparents.
Grandparent’s
Tea,
various
Field
Days,
Fashion
Shows,
etc.
The
students
are
so
very
excited
when
their
grandparents
are
in
attendance.
The
life
experiences
that
grandparents
bring,
and
share…
there
is
nothing
else
like
it.
Fishing,
gardening,
and
other
skills
that
are
not
only
important…
but
more
importantly,
time
together.
Looking
back
at
my
own
life,
the
time
with
my
grandparents
was
priceless.
Old
photos
that
show
the
magic,
and
just
how
happy
I
was
to
have
that
time.
I’d
be
more
than
happy
to
share
more
about
the
importance
of
grandparents
if
needed.
Please
don’t
hesitate
to
contact
me.
