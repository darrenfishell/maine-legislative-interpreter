Opinion  
STANFILL , C.J.  
 
[¶1] Zenda L. Fiske is Paul B.D. Fiske’s mother, Brandy 
Fiske’s mother -in-law, and the grandmother of the three 
children at issue in this case.1 The grandmother appeals 
from an order entered by the District Court (Lincoln, 
Stitham, J. ) dismissing her petition for grandparent visitation for  lack of standing. See 19-A M.R.S. § 1803(1) 
(2022) . We affirm.  
 1 
 Throughout this opinion, Zenda is referred to as “the 
grandmother,” Brandy as “the mother,” and Paul as 
“the father.”  
 
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶2] The grandmother petitioned against the mother and 
father for visitation rights under the Grandparents and 
Great -grandparents Visitation Act (GVA), 19-A M.R.S. 
§§ 1801 -1806 (2022) . Her petition was accompanied by 
an affidavit alleging facts to support her standing as 
required by 19-A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(A) . In her affidavit, 
the grandmother asserted that she had cared for the 
children “nearly seven days a week, including overnights” 
and that the childr en “had a strong relationship” with her. 
She further asserted that the mother “abruptly ceased all 
contact” between the grandmother and the children in 
October 2020.  
  
[¶3] Pursuant to section 1803(2)(B) , the mother filed a 
responsive affidavit in which *32 she asserted that the 
grandmother was merely a paid babysitter and detailed the 
reasons wh y it was not in the children’s best interest to 
have continued contact with her.2 The court indicated that 
it could not determine from the filings alone whether the 
grandmother had standing and scheduled a hearing on 
standing. Id. § 1803(2)(C) . 
 2 
 The father was duly served but did not participate in the 
hearing or appeal.  
 
 
[¶4] Followi ng the hearing, the court determined that the 
grandmother did not have standing and dismissed her 
petition. In its order, the court did “not find it more likely 
than not that” the grandmother has had extraordinary 
contact with the children or that she has been their 
primary caregiver and custodian for a significant period, 
concluding that she did not prove that she had a sufficient 
existing relationship with the children. See id.  § 1802(2) 
(defining “sufficient existing relationship” under the 
GVA). The gra ndmother moved for further factual 
findings and legal conclusions, M.R. Civ. P. 52(b) , in 
response to which the court issued an order with some 
additional findings, reiterated its i nitial finding that the 
mother was “ far more credible” than the grandmother, 
and affirmed the dismissal. The grandmother timely 
appealed. See 14 M.R.S. § 1901(1) (2022) ; 19-A M.R.S. § 
104 (2022) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).

 II. DISCUSSION  
[¶5] The grandmother argues that the court applied the 
wrong standard of proof when it dismissed her petition for 
failure to establish standing under the GVA. She claims 
that the court should have determined whether she 
presented prima facie evidence of standing instead of 
requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence. “We 
review the court’s interpretation and application of a 
statute de novo, looking first to the plain meaning of the 
statutory language to give effect to the Legislature’s  
intent.” Wuori v. Otis , 2020 ME 27, ¶ 6, 226 A.3d 771  
(quotation marks omitted).  
  
[¶6] A grandparent can establish standing u nder the GVA 
by showing that the grandparent has a “sufficient existing 
relationship” with a grandchild. 19-A M.R.S. §§ 1802(2) , 
1803(1)(B) . Before 2018, the statute required the court to 
“determine on the basis of the petition and the affidavit 
whether it is more likely than not that there is a sufficient 
existing relationship or, if a s ufficient relationship does 
not exist, that a sufficient effort to establish one has been 
made.” 19-A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(C) (2017) , amended by  
P.L. 2017, ch. 328, § 3 (effe ctive Aug. 1, 2018); see Dorr 
v. Woodard,  2016 ME 79, ¶¶ 20 -27, 140 A.3d 467  (urging 
the Legislature to amend the GVA to reflect the 
constitutional constraints  on its application); Robichaud v. 
Pariseau , 2003 ME 54, ¶ 8, 820 A.2d 1212  (“Standing is 
established, pursuant to subsection 1803(1)(B), when 
grandparents prove they have a s ufficient relationship that 
supports an ‘urgent reason’ to interfere with a fit parent’s 
fundamental right.”)  
  
[¶7] In 2018, the Legislature amended the GVA to require 
that a grandparent petitioning for visitation “demonstrate 
standing ... through a proce dure that more closely tracks 
the procedure for demonstrating standing to obtain de 
facto parentage of a child under the Maine Parentage 
Act.” L.D. 1670, Summary (128th Legis. 2017). 
Specifically, the GVA now provides:  
The court shall determine on the basis of the pleadings 
and affidavits under [ section 1803(2)(A) -(B)] whether 
the grandparent has presented prima facie *33 evidence 
of standing under [ section 1803(1) ]. The court may in 
its sole discretion, if necessary and on an expedited basis, hold a hearing to determi ne disputed facts that 
are necessary and material to the issue of standing.  
19-A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(C) (2022) . As a r esult of the 2018 
amendment, the procedures to determine standing under 
the GVA and the de facto parentage statute are essentially 
identical. Compare  19-A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(A) -(C) with 
19-A M.R.S. § 1891(2)(A) -(C) (2022) . 
  
[¶8] We clarified the standard of proof needed to show 
standing under the de facto parentage statute in Davis v. 
McGuire , 2018 ME 72, 186 A.3d 837 . There, we held that 
“a party seeking to be adjudicated as a de facto parent is 
subject to a preli minary burden to persuade the court of 
the party’s standing, and not merely to produce evidence 
of standing. ... [T]he claimant’s evidence must be 
persuasive, meaning that the proof must be at least a 
preponderance.” Id. ¶¶ 25 -26 (citation omitted). Given 
that the de facto parentage statute and the GVA have the 
same framework for determining standing, Davis ’s 
holding that a single standard of proof —preponderance of 
the evidence —governs standing determinations under the 
de facto parentage statute applies with equal force to the 
GVA. See id. ¶ 19 . The court correctly required the 
grandmother to prove standing by a preponderance of the 
evidence.  
  
[¶9] The grandmother also argues that the court’s findings 
as to standing were clearly erroneous. Because the 
grandmother had the burden of proof at the hearing on 
standing, she must establish on appeal that the evidence 
compelled the court to find in her favor. Id. ¶ 28. She has 
failed to do so.  
  
[¶10] Because the court applied the correct standard of 
proof and the record did not compel the court to make 
factual findings in the grandmother’s favor, we affirm.  
  
The entry is : 
Judgment affirmed.
