Synopsis  
Grandparents appealed from judgment entered in the 
Superior Co urt, Sagadahoc County, Humphrey , J., 
affirming order of the District Court, West Bath, Field , J., 
dismissing their petition for visitation with their 
grandchildren. The Supreme Judicial Court, Saufley , J., 
held that, as a matter of first  impression, where 
grandparents had acted as children’s parents for 
significant periods of time, Grandparents Visitation Act, 
requiring sufficient existing relationship between 
grandparents and children in order for grandparents to 
have standing to petitio n for visitation, served compelling 
state interest, and because Act was narrowly tailored to 
serve that compelling interest, it could be applied in this 
case without violating constitutional rights of parents, 
who were competent, and as such, the Act did n ot violate 
the due process clause.  
  
Vacated and remanded with instructions.

Opinion  
 SAUFLEY , J. 
 
[¶ 1] We are called upon here to determine whether 
Maine’s Grandparents Visitation Act violates the 
constitutional rights of competent parent s who choose not 
to have their children visit with their grandparents. We 
conclude that the Act, as applied to the facts presented to 
us, is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state 
interest, and thus does not violate the Due Process Clause 
of the Fou rteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  
  
[¶ 2] The grandparents before us, Rose and Chesley 
Rideout, appeal from a judgment entered in the Superior 
Court (Sagadahoc County, Humphrey, J. ) affirming an 
order of the District Court (West Bath, Field, J. ) 
dismissing their petition for visitation with their 
grandchildren. The District Court held that the 
Grandparents Visitation Act, 19–A M.R.S.A. §§ 
1801 –1805 (1998) , violates the Fourteenth Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution because it does not require a 
showing of harm to the child before a court can order 
visitation with a grandparent.1 The court concluded that 
the “best interest of the child standing by itself is not a 
compelling state interest.” We do not disagree with th at 
conclusion. We conclude, however, that the state does 
have a compelling interest in providing a forum within 
which grandparents who have acted as parents to their 
grandchild may seek continued contact with that child. 
Thus, we vacate the judgment dismis sing the Rideouts’ 
visitation petition and remand for an application of the 
Act after a new hearing.  
 1 
 The District Court originally found that 19 M.R.S.A. §§ 
1001 –1004  (Supp.1995 –96) was unconstitutional. This 
statute was repealed and replaced by 19–A M.R.S.A. §§ 
1801 –1805 (1998) . The Superior Court remanded the 
case to the District Court for a determination of 
whether th e recodification affected its legal analysis. 
The District Court found no change in the revised 
Grandparents Visitation Act that would alter its 
decision, and thus, we review the Act as it exists today.  
 
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 3] The underlying procedural and historical facts may 
be summarized as follows.2 Rose and Chesley Rideout 
wish to visit with their three gr andchildren. The parents of 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198

 the children do not currently want their children to spend 
time with the Rideouts. All three children live with their 
parents, Heaven –Marie Riendeau and Jeffrey Riendeau. 
Heaven –Marie is the daughter of the Rideouts. The 
childre n are Keiko –Marie, now 13 years old *295  (born 
February 6, 1987); Roman, now 11 years old (born 
February 16, 1989); and, Mariah, now 7 years old (born 
June 10, 1993). Jeffrey is the biological father of Mariah 
and the ad optive father of Roman.  
 2 
 The trial court’s judgment conta ins substantial findings 
of fact which the parties do not dispute. Our recitation 
of the facts is drawn from those findings.  
 
 
[¶ 4] Heaven was a sixteen -year-old high school student, 
unmarried, and living at home with the Rideouts when she 
gave birth to Keiko. During the first seven years of 
Keiko’s life, four years of Roman’s life, and several 
months of Mariah’s life, the Rideouts were the children’s 
“primary caregivers and custodians.” In Keiko’s early 
years, Rose’s significant involvement in caring for  Keiko 
upset Heaven and caused friction between Heaven and 
Rose. On several occasions, Heaven left Keiko in the sole 
custody of Rose and signed written powers of attorney for 
Rose to act as Keiko’s legal guardian. Heaven moved first 
to Massachusetts and th en to Bangor for Job Corps 
training. After she completed her training in 1989, 
Heaven moved in with her then -husband, Joseph 
Henderson, and their newborn son, Roman. At Rose’s 
urging, Keiko went to live with her mother and her 
stepfather. Soon, however, He nderson became violent and 
abusive, and Heaven and her two children returned to live 
with the Rideouts.  
  
[¶ 5] In June 1992, Heaven and Jeffrey Riendeau married. 
Approximately one year later, and about the time of 
Mariah’ s birth, Heaven and Jeffrey separated, “primarily 
because of the tensions caused by Rose’s interference in 
their family unit.” At this point, Heaven and the three 
children again went to live with the Rideouts. Despite 
returning to live with -her parents, He aven’s relationship 
with Rose remained strained. After Heaven moved back 
in with her parents, Rose contacted the Department of 
Human Services regarding Heaven and Jeffrey’s care of 
the children. Additionally, Rose filed a petition seeking to 
adopt Keiko. H eaven and the three children left the 
Rideouts’ home near the time Rose contacted the 
authorities, and Heaven terminated all contact between 
grandparents and grandchildren after returning to live 
with Jeffrey. From this point forward, Heaven and Jeffrey 
appear to have enjoyed a stable home life. The Rideouts 
filed the instant complaint seeking court -ordered 
visitation pursuant to the Grandparents Visitation Act, and 
the parents moved to dismiss on the ground that the Act is unconstitutional.  
  
[¶ 6] The Dis trict Court held a combined hearing on the 
merits and the motion to dismiss. Although the court 
granted the motion to dismiss, it also undertook to find 
the facts, and in so doing, determined that the Rideouts 
had met the statutory criteria and would be en titled to 
visitation pursuant to the terms of the Act if the Act were 
constitutional. The court, however, ordered no visitation, 
concluding that the Act violated the Due Process Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment.3 The grandparents 
appealed to the Superior Court without success and now 
bring their appeal before us.4 
 3 
 Neither party made an argument concerning the 
applicability of the Maine Constitution to the 
constitutional validity of the Act, and therefore, we do 
not address this issue on appeal. Berg v. Bragdon,  1997 
ME 129, ¶ 9, 695 A.2d 1212, 1214  (holding that an 
issue is waived if it is not raised or preserved by the 
parties). See me. ConstT. art. I, § 6 –A. 
 
 
4 
 Part of the inordinate delay in the Superior Court was 
occasioned by a failure to comply with the briefing 
schedule and by a remand to permit the District Court 
to determine whether a re codification of the Act 
impacted its legal analysis. See P.L.1995, ch. 694, § 
B–2 (effective date October 1, 1997).  
 
 
 
 
II. DISCUSSION  
 
A. Troxel v. Granville  
[¶ 7] No analysis of Maine’s Grandparents Visitation Act 
can be undertaken without a review of the recent decision 
of the U.S. Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville,  530 
U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) . 
  
[¶ 8] In Troxel,  the Court was called upon to review the 
constitutionality of the *296  State of Washington’s 
version of a nonparent visitation statute. Troxel,  530 U.S. 
at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2057.  The Washington statute is 
significantly broader tha n the Maine Act. See wash. Rev. 
Code AnnN. § 26.10.160(3)  (West 1998). The 
Washington Supreme Court struck down its  statute on the 
basis of the U.S. Constitution, holding that the statute 
unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right of 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  3 
 parents to rear their children. Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2057.  In so holding, the Washington Supreme 
Court reasoned that the statute required “no threshold 
showing of harm” and that it allowed “ ‘ any person’ to 
petition for forced visitation of a child at ‘any time’ with 
the only requirement being that the visitation serve the 
best interest of the child.”5 Id. 530 U.S. at ––––  – –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2058 –59 (citations omitted). The contrast of 
Maine’s more tailored Act, which applies only to 
grandparents and provides a number of protections for 
parents, is highlighted by Justice O’Connor’s desc ription 
of the Washington statute as one that “effectively permits 
any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision 
by a parent concerning visitation of the parent’s children 
to state -court review.” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 
2061 .6 
 5 
 The best interests of the child standard has at times 
been criticized as indeterminate, leading to 
unpredictable results. As one judge has observed:  
What is best for children depends upon values and 
norms upon which reasonable people differ. Broad 
room for debate means a broad and unpredictable 
array of possible outcomes in any custody contest. 
That fact encourages prolonged and expensive 
litigation an d “strategic behaviors” of the parents, 
neither of which usually benefits children.  
Honorable John C. Sheldon, Anticipating the American 
Law Institute’s Principles of the Law of Family 
Dissolution,  14 me. B.J. 18, 25 (1999) (citations 
omitted).  
 
 
6 
 In addition to a significantly different statutory 
frame work, the facts at issue in Troxel  were very 
different from those before us. The Troxel  Court was 
faced with a parent who had agreed  to allow the 
grandparents, the parents of her deceased husband, to 
visit with her children. Troxel v. Granville,  530 U.S. 
57, ––––  – –––– , 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2061 –63, 147 
L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) . The paternal gr andparents filed a 
visitation petition “soon after the death [by suicide] of 
their son.” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061 . 
 
 
[¶ 9] Writing for a plurality of the Court, Justice 
O’Connor found the Washington statute unconstitutional. 
Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2065.  The plurality 
found it pivotal that the Washington statute entirely 
eliminated the parents from the decision -making process, 
noting that “[o]nce th e visitation petition has been filed in 
court and the matter is placed before a judge, a parent’s 
decision that visitation would not be in the child’s best 
interest is accorded no deference. ” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2061  (emphasis added). Indeed, the 
Washington statute “contains no requirement that a court 
accord the parent’ s decision any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever. ” Id. (emphasis added). 
Concluding that the “Due Process Clause does not permit 
a State to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make childrearing decisions simply because a state ju dge 
believes a ‘better’ decision could be made,” the Court 
declared the Washington statute unconstitutional as 
applied. Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2064 . 
  
[¶ 10] Although the Troxel  plurality found the 
Washington statute to be unconstitutional because it was 
“breathtakingly broad,” it was careful not to decide 
matters beyond those t hat were before it. Id. 530 U.S. at 
–––– , –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061, 2064.  The plurality  noted 
that “[b]ecause much state -court adjudication in this 
context occurs on a case -by-case basis, we would be 
hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation 
statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a per se 
matter.” Id. at 2064  (citations omitted). Moreover, given 
the “sweeping breadth” of the Washington statute, the 
Troxel plurality was not called upon to engage in a strict 
scrutiny of the statute. Id. Under no level of scrutiny 
would the Washington statute be *297  deemed consistent 
with the concepts embodied in the Due Process Clause.7 
 7 
 The plurality opinion and Justices Thomas and Stevens 
expressly recognized that parents have a “fundamental 
right” to the care and custody of their children. Troxel,  
530 U.S. at –––– , –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2060, 2068  
(Thomas, J., concurring), 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct . at 
2071  (Stevens, J., dissenting). In recognition of this 
“fundamental right,” Justice Thomas opined that the 
statute could not survive analysis in accordance with 
the strict scrutiny standard of review. Id. 530 U.S. at 
–––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2068  (Thomas, J., concurring). 
Justices Souter and Kennedy recognized that parents 
have a constitut ional right protected by the Due Process 
Clause. Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2066  (Souter, 
J., concurring), 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2076  
(Kennedy, J., d issenting). Justice Souter voted to affirm 
on the basis that the statute “sweeps too broadly and is 
unconstitutional on its face.” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2066  (Souter, J., concurring).  
 
 
[¶ 11] Thus, although the Troxel  Court d eclared the 
Washington statute unconstitutional, it did so on the 
limited facts and law before it, leaving for another day a 
constitutional analysis of statutes with more carefully 
established protections of parents’ fundamental rights.  
  
 [¶ 12] The Troxel  opinion does, however, provide us 
with clear guidance on important points. First,  
The liberty  interest at issue in this case —the interest of 
parents in the care, custody, and control of their 
children —is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.  
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  4 
 Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2060.  The fundamental 
right of parents to direct the care and upbringing of their 
children does not disappear in th e face of a third party’s 
request for visitation with the children. Second, the best 
interests of the child standard, standing alone, is an 
insufficient standard for determining when the State may 
intervene in the decision making of competent parents. Id. 
530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061.  And finally, because 
of the “ presumption that fit parents act in the best interests 
of their children,” trial courts must accord special weight 
to parents’ decisions and objections regarding requests for 
third -party visitation. Id. 530 U.S. at ––––  – –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2061 –62.8 
 8 
 We think it also significant that the Troxel  Court gave 
particular notice to the expansive reading of the statute 
by the Washington Supreme Court, noting that the 
“Washington Supreme Court had the oppo rtunity to 
give [the statute] a narrower reading, but it declined to 
do so.” Troxe l, 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061  
(citation omitted). In recognition of the rapidly 
changing face of Maine families, we proceed with 
caution in this developing area of family law and 
refrain from announcing sweeping statements of 
constitutionality.  
 
 
[¶ 13] With these principles in mind, we turn to our 
analysis of the Maine Grandparents Visitation Act.  
  
 
 
B. Standard of Review  
 [¶ 14] The constitutionality of the Grandparents 
Visitation Act presents a question of first impression in 
Maine.9 Because the District Court ruled on the validity of 
the Act as a matter of law, we review the court’s decision 
de novo, Estate of Jacobs,  1998 ME 233, ¶ 4, 719 A.2d 
523, 524,  and we accord no special deference to the 
review conducted in the Superior Court. Pepperman v. 
Town of Rangeley,  1999 ME 157, ¶ 3, 739 A.2d 851, 852.  
Our review is guided by the familiar principle that “[a] 
statute is presumed to be constitutional and the person  
challenging the constitutionality has the burden of 
establishing its infirmity.” Kenny v. Dep’t of Human 
Servs.,  1999 ME 158, ¶ 7, 740 A.2d 560, 563  (citation 
omitted). Because we must assume that the Legislature 
acted in accord with due process requirements, if we can 
reasonably interpret a statute as satisfying those 
constitutional r equirements, we must read it in such a 
way, *298  notwithstanding other possible unconstitutional 
interpretations of the same statute. Portland Pipe Line 
Corp. v. Envtl. Improvement Comm’n,  307 A.2d 1, 15 –16 
(Me.1973) .  9 
 Although the Act’s constitutionality has been 
previously argued to us, we declined to consid er that 
claim because it was not properly preserved for review. 
Berg,  1997 ME 129, ¶ 10, 695 A.2d at 1215 . 
 
 
 [¶ 15] Our role in reviewing the constitutionality of a 
statute must necessarily be limited by the facts in the cas e 
before us. We may not reach beyond those facts to decide 
the constitutionality of matters not yet presented. United 
States v. Raines,  362 U.S. 17, 21 –22, 80 S. Ct. 519, 4 
L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) ; State v. Gray,  440 A.2d 1062, 1064 
(Me.1982) . We agree with the wisdom of Justice 
Brennan, writing for the unanimous Court in Raines,  in 
which he concluded that an appellate court must be bound 
by two rules: “one, never ... anticipate a question of 
constitutional law in advance of the necessity of d eciding 
it; the other, never ... formulate a rule of constitutional 
law broader than is required by the precise facts to which 
it is to be applied.” Raines,  362 U.S. at 21, 80 S.Ct. 519  
(citation omitted). Hence, we address the constitutionality 
of the Act before us in the context of the facts found by 
the District Court.  
  
 
 
C. The Act  
[¶ 16] The Grandparents Visitation Act was enacted to 
provide a forum where certain grandparents could seek 
access to their grandchildren.10 The Act provides *299  
that grandparents will have standing to bring a petition for 
visitation only if they demonstrate (1) th e death of one of 
the parents; (2) a “sufficient existing relationship” with 
their grandchildren; or (3) a sufficient effort to sustain a 
relationship. 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(1) (1998) . 
 10 
 Section 1803  reads as follows in its entirety:  
§ 1803 . Petition  
1. Standing to petition for visitation rights . A 
grandparent of a minor child may petition the court 
for reasonable rights of visitation or access if:  
A. At least one of the child’s parents or legal 
guardians has died;  
B. There is a sufficient e xisting relationship 
between the grandparent and the child; or  
C. When a sufficient existing relationship between 
the grandparent and the child does not exist, a 
sufficient effort to establish one has been made.  
2. Procedure.  The following procedures apply  to 
petitions for rights of visitation or access under 
subsection 1, paragraph B or C.  
A. The grandparent must file with the petition for 
rights of visitation or access an affidavit alleging a 
sufficient existing relationship with the child, or 
that suffic ient efforts have been made to establish 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  5 
 a relationship with the child. When the petition 
and accompanying affidavit are filed with the 
court, the grandparent shall serve a copy of both 
on at least one of the parents or legal guardians of 
the child.  
B. The parent or legal guardian of the child may 
file an affidavit in response to the grandparent’s 
petition and accompanying affidavit. When the 
affidavit in response is filed with the court, the 
parent or legal guardian shall deliver a copy to the 
grandparent.  
C. The court shall determine on the basis of the 
petition and the affidavit whether it is more likely 
than not that there is a sufficient existing 
relationship or, if a sufficient relationship does not 
exist, that a sufficient effort to establish one has 
been made.  
D. If the court’s determination under paragraph C 
is in the affirmative, the court shall hold a hearing 
on the grandparent’s petition for reasonable rights 
of visitation or access and shall consider any 
objections the parents or legal guardians may have 
concerning the award of rights of visitation or 
access to the grandparent. The standard for the 
award of reasonable rights of visitation or access is 
provided in subsection 3.  
3. Best interest of the child.  The court may grant a 
grandparent reason able rights of visitation or access 
to a minor child upon finding that rights of visitation 
or access are in the best interest of the child and 
would not significantly interfere with any 
parent -child relationship or with the parent’s rightful 
authority ove r the child. In applying this standard, 
the court shall consider the following factors:  
A. The age of the child;  
B. The relationship of the child with the child’s 
grandparents, including the amount of previous 
contact;  
C. The preference of the child, if ol d enough to 
express a meaningful preference;  
D. The duration and adequacy of the child’s 
current living arrangements and the desirability of 
maintaining continuity;  
E. The stability of any proposed living 
arrangements for the child;  
F. The motivation of th e parties involved and their 
capacities to give the child love, affection and 
guidance;  
G. The child’s adjustment to the child’s present 
home, school and community;  
H. The capacity of the parent and grandparent to 
cooperate or to learn to cooperate in child care;  
I. Methods of assisting cooperation and resolving 
disputes and each person’s willingness to use 
those methods; and  
J. Any other factor having a reasonable bear ing on 
the physical and psychological well -being of the 
child.  
4. Modification or termination.  The court may 
modify or terminate any rights granted under this section as circumstances require. Modification or 
termination of rights must be consistent with t his 
section.  
5. Enforcement.  The court may issue any orders 
necessary to enforce orders issued under this section 
or to protect the rights of parties.  
6. Costs and fees.  The court may award costs, 
including reasonable attorney’s fees, for defending or 
prosecuting actions under this chapter.  
19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803 (1998) . 
 
 
[¶ 17] Only subsection 1803(1)(B) of the Act is before us, 
and we have no occasio n to consider the remaining 
prongs.11 Thus, we do not a ddress the constitutionality of 
subsections 1803(1)(A) or 1803(1)(C); we determine only 
whether subsection 1803(1)(B), requiring a “sufficient 
existing relationship between the grandparent and the 
child,” can be applied in a manner consistent with the Due 
Process Clause.  
 11 
 Although Keiko and Roman both spent years in the 
care of the Rideouts, their sister Mariah has spent very 
little time with her grandparents. The parties have 
stipulated, however, that the children are very close and 
should be treated identically for purposes of the  Act. 
Therefore, all three of the children are treated as if they 
have the same “sufficient existing relationship” with 
their grandparents.  
 
 
 
 
D. Constitutionality of the “Su fficient Existing 
Relationship” Provision  
 [¶ 18] We begin our analysis by recognizing that parents 
have a fundamental liberty interest “to make decisions 
concerning the care, custody, and control of their 
children.” Troxel,  530 U.S. at ––––, 120 S.Ct. at 2060  
(citations omitted). In other words, the right to direct and 
control  a child’s upbringing is a “fundamental” liberty 
interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Id. We 
understand this fundamental right to be firmly 
established.12 “Accordingly, so long as a parent 
adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there 
will normally  be no reason for the State to inject itself 
into the private realm of the family to further question the 
ability of that parent to make the best decisions 
concerning the rearing of that parent’s child ren.” Id. 530 
U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061  (citing Reno v. Flores,  
507 U.S. 292, 304, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) ) 
(emphasis added).

401, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923)  (holding that 
the liberty protected under the Due Process Clause 
includes the right of parents to direct the upbringi ng 
and control the education of their children). See, e.g., 
Osier v. Osier,  410 A .2d 1027, 1029 (Me.1980)  
(recognizing parents’ “fundamental right” to the “care 
and custody” of their children); Danforth v. State Dep’t 
of Health & Welfare,  303 A.2d 794, 797 (Me.1973)  
(discussing the natural and fundamental rights of 
parents to the custody of their children).  
 
 
 [¶ 19] The constitutional liberty interest in family 
integrity is not, however, absolute, nor forever free from 
state interference. Wisconsin v. Yoder,  406 U.S. 205, 
233–34, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) ; 
McNicholas v. Bickford,  612 A.2d 866, 870 (Me.1992) . 
The Due Process Clause is not  an impenetrable wall 
behind which parents may shield their children; rather, it 
provides heightened protection against state intervention 
in parents’ fundamental right to make decisions 
concerning the care, custody, and control of their 
children. See  *300  Parham v. J.R.,  442 U.S. 584, 
603–05, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) . That 
heightened protection mandates strict sc rutiny of the 
statute at issue. See Washington v. Glucksberg,  521 U.S. 
702, 720 –21, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) ; 
Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 1 v. Comm’r, Dep’t of Educ.,  659 
A.2d 854, 857 (Me.1995) . Strict scrutiny requires that the 
State’s action be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling 
state interest. Flores,  507 U.S. at 301 –02, 113 S.Ct. 1439;  
Butler v. Supreme Judicial Court,  611 A.2d 987, 992 
(Me.1992) . 
  
[¶ 20] Therefore, because a fundame ntal liberty interest is 
unquestionably at stake here, we must determine first, 
whether that fundamental liberty interest is interfered 
with, by the State,  in the context of the Grandparents 
Visitation Act. If so, we apply strict scrutiny to the 
portions o f the Act before us to determine whether the 
State has narrowly tailored its involvement in the family 
to serve a compelling state interest.  
  
 
 
(i) State Intervention in a Fun damental Right  
 [¶ 21] We conclude, and no party has challenged, that 
the Grandparents Visitation Act provides a mechanism by 
which the State may intervene in the basic exercise of 
parents’ rights to determ ine the care and custody of their 
children. The Act allows the courts to determine whether parents will be required to turn their children over to the 
grandparents against the parents’ wishes. The power of 
the court to adjudicate such disputes and to enfor ce its 
own orders constitutes state involvement in a way that 
clearly implicates parents’ fundamental liberty interests in 
the care and custody of their children.13 
 13 
 See, e.g., Connecticut v. Doehr,  501 U.S. 1, 10 –11, 111 
S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991)  (noting that 
prejudgment remedy statutes enable a party to utilize 
state procedures with the “overt, significant assistance 
of state officials,” thereby involving state action 
substantial enough to implicate the Due Process 
Clause); see also Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr., Inc.,  
485 U.S. 80, 85, 108 S.Ct. 896, 99 L.Ed.2d 75 (1988) ; 
Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc.,  457 U.S. 922, 941, 
102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) . 
 
 
 
 
(ii) Compelling State Interest  
 [¶ 22] Because a fundamental liberty interest is 
interfered with by the State, the State is required to 
demonstrate that its  actions serve a compelling state 
interest. The District Court, in its thoughtful analysis 
regarding the necessity of a compelling state interest, 
noted that “[i]f ... the Act provided a requirement of harm, 
then it would advance a compelling state interes t and pass 
constitutional muster.” Concluding that the absence of a 
“harm” element eliminated any compelling state interest, 
the court held the Act to be unconstitutional.  
  
 [¶ 23] An element of “harm” in the traditional sense is 
not, however, the only compelling state interest extant 
when matters relating to the welfare of children are under 
scrutiny. For example, the State’s compelling interest in 
requiring school attendance or restricting child labor doe s 
not derive exclusively from the State’s interest in 
preventing “harm,” but instead stems from the State’s 
broader parens patriae  interest in the well -being of 
children. See Prince v. Massachusetts,  321 U.S. 158, 
166–67, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944) ; Pierce v. 
Soc’y of Sisters,  268 U.S. 510, 534, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 
L.Ed. 1070 (1925) ; see also In re Sarah T.,  629 A.2d 53, 
55 (Me.1993)  (finding a compelling state interest in 
achieving timely permanence for abused children). Thus, 
although the threat of har m to a child is certainly 
sufficient to provide the State with a compelling interest,14 
harm consisting of a threat to physical *301  safety or 
imminent danger is not a sine qua non  for the exi stence of 
a compelling state interest. We agree with the trial court, 
however, that something more than the best interest of the 
child must be at stake in order to establish a compelling

 state interest.15 
 14 
 The State’s authority over parental decisions is well 
established in certain areas, such as health 
requirements, including immunization needs, 20–A 
M.R.S.A. § 6354 (1993) , education requirements, 
including a qualified schooling plan, 20–A M.R.S.A. § 
5001 –A (1993) , and safety requirements, addressed in 
the Child and Family Services and Child Protection 
Act, 22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4001 –4093 (1992 & Supp.1999) . 
See, e.g., Jacobson v. Massachusetts,  197 U.S. 11, 
29–30, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905)  (upholding 
state’s compelling interest in compulsory vaccination 
laws).  
 
 
15 
 In fact, the concept that the State may not interven e in 
family life merely on the basis of a best interest 
determination is so well established that we have 
explicitly directed trial courts not to reach the best 
interest prong in termination of parental rights cases 
until the State has made a showing of pa rental unfitness 
based on one of four statutory bases for termination. 
See In re Ashley A. , 679 A.2d 86, 89 (Me.1996) . Unless 
the court has found the presence of one of those “harm” 
factors, it may not even consider  the best interests of 
the child. See In re Leona T.,  609 A.2d 1157, 1158 
(Me.1992) ; see also Smith v. Org. of Foster Families,  
431 U.S. 816, 862 –63, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 
(1977)  (Stewart, J., concurring) (“If a State were to 
attempt to force the bre akup of a natural family, over 
the objections of the parents and their children, without 
some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that 
to do so was thought to be in the children’s best 
interest, I should have little doubt that the State would 
have  intruded impermissibly on ‘the private realm of 
family life which the state cannot enter.’ ” (citation 
omitted)).  
 
 
 [¶ 24] We are not called upon here to define all instances 
where a compelling interest could be demonstrated by the 
State. We need only look to the facts before us to 
determine whether that level of interest exists, and for that 
determination we are guided b y our own language: “The 
natural right of a parent to the care and control of a child 
should be limited only for the most urgent reasons. ” 
Merchant v. Bussell,  139 Me. 118, 27 A.2d 816, 818 
(1942)  (emphasis added).  
  
[¶ 25] We conclude that “urgent reasons”  exist, where, as 
here, a grandparent who has functioned as a parent to the 
child seeks continued contact with that child. The 
Rideouts acted as Keiko and Roman’s parents for many 
years. Keiko spent so much of her first seven years being 
parented by her gr andparents that she called the Rideouts 
“Mom and Dad” and referred to her own mother as “her 
aunt.”    
[¶ 26] The cessation of contact with a grandparent whom 
the child views as a parent may have a dramatic, and even 
traumatic, effect upon the child’s well -being. The State, 
therefore, has an urgent, or compelling, interest in 
providing a forum for those grandparents having such a 
“sufficient existing relationship” with their grandchildren. 
Here the Rideouts have acted as parents for their 
grandchildren, and therefore may seek continued access to 
those children. This interest springs not from any 
common law right of the grandparent to visitation with 
the child, but from the child’s significant need to be 
assured that he or she will not unnecessarily lose conta ct 
with a grandparent who has been a parent to that child.16 
See *302   Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2071  
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (“There is at a minimum a third 
individual, whose interests are implicated in every case to 
which the statute applies —the child.”).  
 16 
 Contrary to the assertions of our colleagues in the 
Concurrence, any “confluence of constitutional rights” 
cannot include the grandparents as separate holders of 
such rights. Grandparents simply do not have a general 
common law or constitutional right of access to their 
grandchildren. Indeed, it was the lack of any legal 
authority for securing the court’s assistance in 
obtaining visits between grandparents and their 
grandchildren that led the Legislature to enact the very 
statute before us today. “As a general matter ... 
contemporary state -court decisions acknowledge that 
‘[h]istorically, grandparents had no legal right of 
visitat ion.’ ” Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 
2077  (Kennedy, J. dissenting) ( citation omitted). Id. 
530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061;  Conservatorship 
of Justin R.,  662 A.2d 232, 234 –35 (Me.1995)  
(affirming a denial o f the grandparent’s guardianship 
petition in the absence of parental unfitness); Stanl ey v. 
Penley,  142 Me. 78, 46 A.2d 710, 712 (1946)  
(declining to award custody of children to maternal 
grandparents when father was fit and present).  
Rather, grandparents’ rights, if any, stem derivatively 
from the “recognition ... that children  should h ave the 
opportunity to benefit from relationships with 
statutorily specified persons —for example, their 
grandparents.” Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 
2059  (emphasis added). “Because grandparents and 
other relatives undertake duties of a parental nature  in 
many households, States have sought to ensure the 
welfare of the childr en therein by protecting the 
relationships those children form with such third 
parties.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, although a 
grandparent can and should be a positive influence in a 
child’s life, the biological relationship alone does not 
provide a basis for a legally enforceable interest in a 
child whose parents are present and fit, see In re 
Sterling N.,  673 A.2d 1312, 1314 –15 (Me.1996) , and 
whose relationship with the grandparent is not of a 
“parental nature,” see Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2059 .

 [¶ 27] When a grandparent has been the “primary 
caregiver and custodian” for a child over a  significant 
period of time, the relationship between the child and the 
grandparent warrants application of the court’s parens 
patriae  authority on behalf of the child and provides a 
compelling basis for the State’s intervention into an intact 
family with fit parents. Recently, this compelling interest 
has been recognized in several other contexts, based upon 
the reasoning that a parent’s fundamental liberty interest 
must be balanced against a “[child’s] interest in 
continuing to have access to the only adu lt who has acted 
as a parent to [the child].” Youmans v. Ramos,  429 Mass. 
774, 711 N.E.2d 165, 172 (1999) ; see also V.C. v. M.J.B.,  
163 N.J. 200,  748 A.2d 539, 548 –49 (2000)  (holding that 
the State may intervene to grant visitation over the 
objections of a parent where the child’s psychological 
parent “has stepped in to assume the role of the legal 
parent who has been unable or unwilling to unde rtake the 
obligations of parenthood”); American Law Institute, 
Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution  § 2.03 
(Tentative Draft No. 4, 2000).17 
 17 
 Because we address only the facts before us, we do not 
determine whether the State would have a compelling 
interest in circumstances where the grandparents assert 
a different type of “sufficient relationship.” 19–A 
M.R.S.A. § 1803(1)(B) . Ordinarily, the State’s interest 
in parents’ childcare decisions is merely “de minimis” 
and does not provide a compelling basis  for state 
intervention. See Quilloin v. Walcott,  434 U.S. 246, 
255, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978) ; Stanley v. 
Illinois,  405 U.S. 645, 657 –58, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 
L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) . 
 
 
[¶ 28] Thus, the State has demonstrated that it has a 
compelling interest i n providing a forum in which a 
grandparent, who has acted as a parent to the child at 
issue, may seek continuing contact with the child.  
  
 
 
(iii) Narrowly Tailored State Actio n 
 [¶ 29] Next, we must determine whether the State’s 
action is narrowly tailored to serve the identified 
compelling state interest. See Glucksberg,  521 U.S. at 
721, 117 S.Ct. 2258  (citing Flores,  507 U.S. at 302, 113 
S.Ct. 1439).  Several aspects of the Act are central to our 
analysis. First, a grandparent must establish standing 
before  litigation may commence on a petition. 19–A 
M.R.S .A. §§ 1803(1), 1803(2)(A) –1803(2)(C). Second, the court must consider any objection of the parents 
concerning an award of rights of visitation or access by 
the grandparents. 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(2)(D) . Third, 
the court may not grant visitation if doing so would 
significantly interfere with any parent -child relationship 
or with the parent’s rightful authority over the child. 19–A 
M.R.S.A. § 1803(3) . 
  
[¶ 30] Each of these requirements provides safeguards 
against unwarranted intrusions into an intact family’s life. 
The first requirement, that the grandparent s demonstrate 
standing before they may litigate their claim, provides 
protection against the expense, stress, and pain of 
litigation, unless and until the grandparents have 
convinced the court that they are among those 
grandparents who may pursue visits un der the Act. 19–A 
M.R.S.A. §§ 1803(1), 1803(2)(A) –1803(2)(C). Trial 
courts must be vigilant in their application of this 
requirement in order to effectuate the Legislature’s efforts 
to narrowly tailor the Act to serve the compelling interest 
of *303  the State. Both the plurality in Troxel  and Justice 
Kennedy’s dissent stressed this factor, stating that “the 
burden of litigating a domestic relations proceeding can 
itself be ‘so disruptive of the parent -child relationship that 
the constitutional right of a custodial parent  to make 
certain basic determinations for the child’s welfare 
becomes implicated.’ ” Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2065  (quoting Justice Kennedy’s dissenting 
opinion at 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2079).18 
 18 
 The Maine judiciary has been sufficiently concerned 
about the detrimental effects litigation has on families 
in turmoil that a Commission was formed to seek 
alternatives to litigated resolutions. See Sumner 
Bernstein, Nonadversarial Administra tive Forum 
Report,  11 me. B.J. 366  (1996); see also  Dana E. 
Prescott, Parental Conflict and the Appointment of 
Referees in Child Custody Cases,  15 me. B.J. 44 (2000) 
(“One of the daunting challenges facing the legal 
system at  the end of the millennium is to find effective 
ways to protect children from the chaos and conflict 
created by feuding parents in custody cases.”). Indeed, 
as the Maine Commission on Gender, Justice, and the 
Courts concluded in a recent report, “[r]esolut ion of 
custody disputes through the adversarial process is, 
among other things, damaging to the psychological 
well-being of children and parents.” judicial Branch 
Performance Council, Report on the Implementation of 
the Recommendations of the Maine Commiss ion on 
Gender, Justice, and the Courts 9 (2000).  
 
 
[¶ 31] The second protective aspect of the Act, the 
requirement that the trial court give consideration to the 
parent’s objection to visitation, is equally important. 
19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(2)(D) . This provision gives life to 
the presumption that the parents are acting in the best 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198

 interests of their child. See Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2061  (citing Parham,  442 U.S. at 602, 99 S.Ct. 
2493).  The court may not simply consider the best 
interests of the child, but must also consider and give 
significant weight to the p arents’ position, thus preventing 
the court from intervening in a fit parent’s decision 
making simply on a best interests basis. See id. 530 U.S. 
at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2062 . 
  
[¶ 32] The third protection provides similar limits on the 
court’s authority, precluding the court from awarding 
visits or access to grandparents unless the co urt finds that 
those visits would not “significantly interfere” with the 
parent -child relationship or with the parent’s rightful 
authority over the child. 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(3) . 
Again, the court must focus its attention, not solely on the 
determination of the best interests of the child, but also on 
how the visitation would affect the parents’ relationship 
with that child. Id. If the court determines that  visits with 
a grandparent will significantly interfere with the 
parent -child relationship, that determination precludes any 
further intrusion into the parent’s decision. See id.  
  
 
 
E. Conclusion  
 [¶ 33] We conclude therefore that where the 
grandparents have acted as the children’s parents for 
significant periods of time, the Grandparents Visitation 
Act serves a compelling state  interest in addressing the 
children’s relationship with the people who have cared for 
them as parents. Because the Act is narrowly tailored to 
serve that compelling interest, it may be applied in this 
case without violating the constitutional rights of th e 
parents.  
  
[¶ 34] Accordingly, we must vacate the judgment of the 
District Court. We note with approval the District Court’s 
effort to avoid further delays in this matter by finding the 
facts and entering a visitation order that could be 
effectuated in t he event that our constitutional analysis 
differed from that of the court. Our conclusion that the 
statute can be applied constitutionally on the facts before 
us is not determinative, however, on the appropriateness 
of visitation itself. Given the need for  a careful 
application of the restrictions of the Act and the passage 
of time since the entry of the court’s judgment, we 
remand the matter to the trial court for further hearing.  
  
The entry is:  
  
*304  Judgment vacated.  Remanded to the Superior Court 
with instructions to remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion herein.  
  
 
 
WATHEN, C.J., with whom RUDMAN, J., joins, 
concurring.  
 
[¶ 35] I concur in the result reached by the Court but write 
separately to distance myself from the curiously 
ambiguous and restricted conclusion “that the state does 
have a c ompelling interest in providing a forum within 
which grandparents who have acted as parents to their 
grandchild may seek continued contact with that child.” 
The District Court held that the Grandparents Visitation 
Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment to t he United 
States Constitution on its face because it requires no 
showing of harm to the child before a court can order 
visitation with a grandparent. The court also concluded 
that the “best interest standard is not a compelling state 
interest by itself.” W ith the advantage of the teaching in 
Troxel,  I reject the notion that the Act is invalid on its 
face and that the application of the best interests of the 
child standard is always unconstitutional in the context of 
grandparent visitation.19 
 19 
 The District Court in the present case took evidence, 
addressed the merits hypothetically, and purported to 
find the Act u nconstitutional as applied.  In fact, the  
court concluded that a showing of harm to the children 
is essential to justify any interference with parental 
rights, and that the best interests standard alone is never 
sufficient. In effect, the court found that the Act could 
never be applied constituti onally and fails a facial 
challenge, see City of Chicago v. Morales,  527 U.S. 41, 
63–64, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) ; United 
States v. Salerno,  481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 
95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987) . 
 
 
[¶ 36] In my judgment, the issue before us is whether the 
Act can ever be applied constitutionally. Al though the 
United States Supreme Court stopped short of ruling on 
this precise issue, the opinion in Troxel  is instructive and 
persuades me that the Act survives a facial challenge.  
  
[¶ 37] I begin my analysis, as did the United States 
Supreme Court, in Troxel,  by recognizing that the passage 
of the Act in Maine and similar statutes in every one of 
the other forty -nine states reflect profound changes in the 
structure of the American family.  
The demographic changes of the past century make it 
difficult to s peak of an average American family. The 
composition of families varies greatly from household 
to household. While many children may have two 
married parents and grandparents who visit regularly, 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198

 many other children are raised in single -parent 
households. I n 1996, children living with only one 
parent accounted for 28 percent of all children under 
age 18 in the United States. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 
Bureau of Census, Current Population Reports, 1997 
Population Profile of the United States 27 (1998). 
Understan dably, in these single -parent households, 
persons outside the nuclear family are called upon with 
increasing frequency to assist in the everyday tasks of 
child rearing. In many cases, grandparents play an 
important role. For example, in 1998, approximately  4 
million children —or 5.6 percent of all children under 
age 18 —lived in the household of their grandparents. 
U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Current 
Population Reports, Marital Status and Living 
Arrangements: March 1998 (Update), p. i (1998).  
The nationwide enactment of nonparental visitation 
statutes is assuredly due, in some part, to the States’ 
recognition of these changing realities of the American 
family. Because grandparents and other relatives 
undertake duties of a parental nature in man y 
households, States have sought to ensure the welfare of 
the children therein by protecting the relationships 
those *305  children form with such third parties. The 
States’ nonparental visitation statutes are further 
supported by a recognition, which varies from State to 
State, that children should have the opportunity to 
benefit from relationships with statutorily specified 
persons —for example, their grandparents.  
Troxel v. Granville,  530 U.S. 57, –––– , 120 S.Ct. 2054, 
2059, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000)  (O’Connor, J., plurality 
opinion).  
  
[¶ 38] In Troxel,  the United States Supreme Court was 
presented with the State of Washington’s version of a 
nonparent visitation statute. The Washington statute is 
significantly broader than the Maine Act. See wash. Rev. 
Code Ann.. §§ 26.10.160 , 26.09 .240 (1998) (allowing 
any third party to petition for visitation at any time, 
subject only to the best interests of the child). Our Act is 
confined to grandparents and in  this case requires a 
“sufficient existing relationship” between grandparent and 
child, see 19–A. M.R.S.A. § 1803(1)(B); no significant 
interference with the parent -child relationship, see § 
1803(3) ; in addition to a finding that visitation is in the 
best interests of the child. See § 1803(3) . The Washington  
Supreme Court struck down its statute on the basis of the 
Federal Constitution and held that the statute 
unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right of 
parents to rear their children. Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2058.  That ruling rested on the fact that the 
statute requires no threshold showing of harm and also 
that by allowing “ ‘any person’ to petition for forced 
visitation of a child at ‘any time’ with the only requirement being that the visitation serve the best in terest 
of the child” the statute sweeps too broadly. See id.  (citing 
In re Custody of Smit h, 137 Wash.2d 1, 969 P.2d 21, 
28–30 (1998) ). In a plurality opinion, four members of the 
United States Supreme Court declined to declare the 
statute unconstitutional on its face. Rather, they found it 
unconstitutional as applied. In doing so, they emph asized 
the need for care in elaborating the precise scope of 
parental due process rights in the visitation context and 
observed that “[b]ecause much state -court adjudication 
occurs on a case -by-case basis, we would be hesitant to 
hold that specific nonpare ntal visitation statutes violate 
the Due Process Clause as a per se  matter.” Troxe l, 530 
U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2064  (O’Connor, J., plurality 
opinion). Two of the dissenting justices, Justices Stevens 
and Kennedy, concluded, each for different reasons, that 
the facial challenge to the statute should fail and Justice 
Kennedy opine d persuasively that a parent does not have 
a constitutional right to prevent visitation in all cases not 
involving harm. See id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 
2068  (Stevens, J., dissenting); id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2075  (Kennedy, J., dissenti ng). Taking into 
account the separate view of Justice Scalia that, as a 
judge, he is without authority to deny legal effect to laws 
that infringe upon rights that are not enumerated in the 
Constitution, see id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2074  
(Scalia, J., dissenting), I can come to only one 
conclusion —on the basis of existing fed eral precedent, 
Maine’s Grandparent Visitation Act does not facially 
violate the Due Process Clause.20 
 20 
 Justice Souter voted to affirm on the basis that the 
statute “sweeps too broadly and is unconstitutional on 
its face.” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2066  
(Souter, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice 
Thomas voted to affirm on the basis that  the statute 
could not survive analysis in accordance with the strict 
scrutiny standard of review. See id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2068  (Thomas, J., concurring in the 
judgment).  
 
 
[¶ 39] The inquiry, however, does not end here. The Act 
escapes a facial challenge, not solely because the 
grandparents in this case may be de facto parents as relied 
upon by the Court. Rather, the Act escapes facial 
invalidity because it operates within the rich confluence 
of the constitutional interests of the parents, the children, 
the state, the grandpa rents, and the family, whether these 
interests are derivative or otherwise. In this complex 
context, *306  categorical statement and pronouncements 
of facial invalidity must yield to careful balancing of the 
competing con stitutional interests of all. To focus with 
strict scrutiny, as does the Court, on the compelling 
interest of the state, vis -a-vis the parents, is to ignore what 
may in a particular case be the equally compelling

 interests of the children, the family, and the grandparents. 
The District Court must apply the Act with great 
sensitivity in order to balance and protect the rights of all 
parties and not run afoul of the constitution. Although the 
United States Supreme Court has not as yet definitively 
catalogued the factual considerations or decisional 
frameworks that are constitutionally required or 
appropriate, developing caselaw offers guidance.  
  
[¶ 40] As the United States Supreme Court grappled with 
the changes in American society that started in the 1960s 
and continue to the present day, the Court has consistently 
expanded the definition of family and recognized that 
individuals other than biological or adoptive parents may 
exercise child -rearing authority. This broader 
understanding of the parent -child rela tionship led the 
Court to acknowledge the rights of nonparents to be a part 
of a child’s life. See Moore v. City of East Cleveland,  431 
U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) . In 
Moore,  an ordinance attempted to restrict children from 
living with their extended families, specifically with their 
grandparents. See id. at 499 –506, 97 S.Ct. 1932.  The 
Court held that this sort of “family choice” is a 
constitutionally -protected area under the Due Process 
Clause even when parents are not involve d. See id.  In 
particular, the Court ruled that a grandmother had the 
right to live with her grandchildren. See id. at 504, 97 
S.Ct. 1932 . 
Ours is by no means a tradition limited to respect for 
the bonds uniting the members of the nuclear family. 
The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially 
grandparents sharing a household along with parents 
and children has roots equally venerable and equally 
deservi ng of constitutional recognition.... Decisions 
concerning child rearing, which [ Wisconsin v. ] Yoder  
[406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (1972)  ], Meyer ], 262 
U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 ], Pierce [, 268 
U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070]  and other cases 
have recognized as entitled to constitutional protection, 
long have been shared with grandparents or other 
relatives who occupy the same household —indeed who 
may take on major responsibility for the rearing of the 
children.  
Id. at 504 –05, 97 S.Ct. 1932;  see also id. at 508 –13, 97 
S.Ct. 1932  (Brennan, J., concurring) (discussing the 
increasing number of nontraditional families in the United 
States and their right to constitutional protection); Stanley 
v. Illinois,  405 U.S. 645, 651 –52, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 
L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)  (recognizing the parental rights of a 
biological father who is not married to his child’s 
biologic al mother). The United States Supreme Court has 
also reaffirmed that the State may regulate the behavior of 
adults, including parents, in the attempt to protect the 
constitutional rights of children. See Bellotti v. Baird,  428 U.S. 132, 147, 96 S.Ct. 2857, 49 L.Ed.2d 844 (1976) ; 
Ginsberg v. New York,  390 U.S. 629, 637 –41, 88 S.Ct. 
1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) . It is constitutionally 
significant that the Maine Act requires a “sufficient 
existing relationship.” Although in my judgment it is not 
controlling, it is also significant that in the present case, 
the grandparen ts may have acted as caregivers over a 
significant period of time and may have developed a close 
relationship with the children. Some courts, without 
statutory authority, have modified the common law 
presumption and opened the door to visitation by adults 
who have become the de facto parent of a child. See In re 
Custody of H.S.H. -K., 193 W is.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419, 
421 (1995) ; see S.F. v. M.D.,  132 Md.App. 99, 751 A.2d 
9, 15 (2000) ; V.C. v. M.J.B.,  163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539,  
551–54 (2000) ; E.N.O. v. L.M.M.,  429 Mass. 824, 711 
N.E.2d 886, 892 –93, cert. denied,  528 U.S. 1005, 120 
S.Ct. 500, 145 L.Ed.2d 386 (1999) . Additionally, *307  
the American Law Institute (ALI ) has suggested that 
being a de facto parent may create a lawful basis to grant 
court -ordered visitation. See principles of the Law of 
Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations § 
2.03(1)(c) (Tentative Draft No. 4, 2000). By confining the 
Act to de f acto parents in the present case, the Court 
unnecessarily strips the Act of any significance beyond 
the limited results that could be achieved at common law.  
  
[¶ 41] One of the primary constitutional deficiencies in 
the application of the Washington statute in Troxel  was 
the fact that the trial court gave no special weight to the 
parent’s determination of her daughter’s best interests. In 
doing so, the court viola ted the constitutional presumption 
“that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.” 
Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2061.  As noted in 
Troxel,  the Maine Act affords a special measure of 
protection for parental decision making by requiring the 
court to find that grandparent visitation would not 
significantly interfere with an y parent -child relationship 
or with the parent’s rightful authority over the child. See 
id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2062  (citing 19–A 
M.R.S.A. § 1803(3) ). In applying the Act, it is important 
for trial courts to appreciate tha t the decisions of fit 
parents are entitled to special weight and that this 
principle is embedded in the Act and is required by the 
Constitution.  
  
[¶ 42] In Troxel,  the United States Supreme Court also 
criticized the failure of the Washington trial court to 
credit the fact that the parent had voluntarily provided 
visitation to the grandparents, never sought to deny 
visitation, and resisted only the expanded visitation the 
grandparents demanded. The Maine Act does not, as do 
the statutes in many other state s, expressly condition an 
award of visitation on a parent’s denial or unreasonable 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)   
2000 ME 198

 denial of visitation to the grandparent. Such 
considerations, however, fit comfortably within the 
comprehensive formulation of best interests set forth in 
the Act. See 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(3)(H), (I) . 
  
[¶ 43] Finally, Troxel  introduces a note of caution about 
sweeping interpretations and applications of nonparen tal 
visitation statutes. The Act deals with an important right 
described as follows by the Supreme Court:  
The liberty interest at issue in this case —the interest of 
parents in the care, custody, and control of their 
children —is perhaps the oldest of the fu ndamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.  
... 
“It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture 
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary 
function and freedom include preparation for 
obligations the state can neither supp ly nor hinder.”  
Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2060  (citation 
omitted) . Courts must afford primacy and weight to the 
interests and views of a fit parent and are not free to 
resolve a difficult call by splitting the difference as the 
Washington trial court did in Troxel.  
  
[¶ 44] The present case illustrates the more exacting  
decisional framework that is required. Here, the court 
determined hypothetically that the requirements of the 
Act had been met and indicated that if the Act were 
constitutional, it would order visitation. The court went on 
to note, without explanation, th at if the children were to 
be exchanged, it would be accomplished under the 
supervision of a third party or guardian ad litem and the 
parents and grandparents were not to be present at the 
delivery point at the same time. Although such a ready 
solution may  be appropriate in a divorce setting for 
resolving a conflict in parental rights, in the context of 
grandparent visitation, it also implicates the analysis of 
best interests. The capacity of the parents and 
grandparents to cooperate and resolve disputes is  an 
explicit part of the best interests analysis required by the 
Act in determining whether visitation *308  should be 
ordered. See 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(3)(H), (I) . 
  
[¶ 45] One court has usefully observed that “[a]s a general 
proposition, visitation awarded to adults is not for their 
gratification or enjoyment, but to fulfill the needs of the 
child.” Fairbanks v. McCarter, 330 Md. 39, 622 A.2d 
121, 126 (1993) . As the United States Supreme Court has 
noted, “[t]he extension of statutory rights in this area to 
persons other than a child’s parents, however, comes with 
an obvious cost,” and could “place a substantial burden on 
the traditional parent -child relations hip.” Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2059.  Under the Act, it is the court’s 
function to order visitation only under the limited 
circumstances when it will benefit the child, and then, 
only if that benefit can be realized without significantly 
burdening or interfering with the parent -child 
relationship.21 
 21 
 The Act seeks to minimize the potential burden on 
parents by requiring the court to first consider a petition 
summa rily on affidavits before ordering an evidentiary 
hearing. Only if the court determines on the basis of the 
petition and the affidavits that “it is more likely than 
not that there is a sufficient existing relationship or ... 
that a sufficient effort to est ablish one has been made,” 
should the court proceed to a hearing. 19–A M.R.S.A. § 
1803(2)(C) . Here, the parents responded to the 
grandparents’ affidavit wi th a motion to dismiss. The 
court leapfrogged over the procedural requirements of 
the Act and went directly to the merits and the 
constitutional challenge. In addition, the Act authorizes 
the court to award “costs, including reasonable 
attorney’s fees, for  defending or prosecuting actions 
....” § 1803(6) . Because of constitutional sensitivities 
and practical considerations, courts should be 
scrupulous in fol lowing the procedures specified in the 
Act. 
 
 
[¶ 46] Because, in my judgment, the Act is not facially 
unconstitutional, I join in vacating the dismissal of the 
action and remanding for further proceedings.  
  
 
 
ALEXANDER , J., dissenting.  
 
[¶ 47] I respectfully dissent. The Court’ s opinion 
thoroughly and correctly reviews the governing legal 
principles which we must apply to determine the 
constitutionality of the Grandparents Visitation Act. In the 
Court’s analysis of that law, I only disagree with its 
conclusion that a partially c onstitutional application of a 
law justifies an interpretation of that law that is totally 
unsupported in the wording of the statute itself. 
Separately, the facts of this case, found by the trial court, 
require judgment for the parents.  
  
[¶ 48] The Court states the governing principle of 
interpretation that “if we can reasonably interpret a statute 
as satisfying ... constitutional requirements, we must read 
it in such a way.” Ante,  ¶ 14 (Court’s opinion). To apply 
this principle of interpretation, there mu st be some words 
to interpret. However, the Court cites no words in the 
statute that may be interpreted to limit its application to 
parent substitutes’ or “de facto” parents’ rights to sue. 
Rather, the Grandparents Visitation Act is an invitation to 
any an d all comers who can call themselves grandparents

 to bring suit to disrupt a family unit. This is not the 
narrow tailoring that strict scrutiny demands of a statute 
that invades a fundamental interest, and the Court’s 
mixing of the concepts of application of law and 
interpretation of law cannot make it so.  
  
[¶ 49] The Court’s approach is analogous to holding that a 
statute authorizing stop and seizure of motorists without 
reason is constitutional if, in two out of three instances, 
the authorities had proba ble cause to stop and seize. The 
narrow tailoring mandate is not satisfied by trusting those 
given authority under broadly unconstitutional statutes to 
apply those statutes only narrowly and constitutionally.  
  
[¶ 50] A parent’s right to direct the upbring ing and control 
of their children is not a right to be lightly cast aside 
whenever the State or the courts think they have a better 
idea about how children should be raised. As the Troxel  
plurality opinion and the majority of this Court recognize, 
parental  rights to direct their children’s upbringing and 
control are a “fundamental” liberty interest protected by 
the Due *309  Process Clause. Troxel v. Granville,  530 
U.S. 57, –––– , 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 
(2000) ; Ante,  ¶ 18 (Court’s opinion).22 In another context, 
the Fifth Circuit recently observed that the “ most essential 
and basic aspect of familial privacy —[is] the right of the 
family to remain together without the coercive 
interference of the awesome power of the state.” Morris v. 
Dearborne,  181 F.3d 657, 667 (5th Cir.1999)  (quoting 
Hodorowski v. Ray,  844 F.2d 1210, 1216 (5th Cir.1988) ). 
 22 
 We have repeatedly held that both the Maine and 
Federal Constitutions recognize “a fundamental and 
important” right of parents to raise their children. In re 
Heather C.,  2000 ME 99, ¶ 23, 751 A.2d 448, 454;  
State v. Wilder,  2000 ME 32, ¶ 20, 748 A.2d 444, 449;  
In re Christmas C.,  1998 ME 258, ¶¶ 10 –11, 721 A.2d 
629, 631 –32; In re Alexander D.,  1998 ME 207, ¶ 14, 
716 A.2d 222, 226 –27. This fundamental liberty 
interest of parents to raise their children includes the 
right “to direct the upbrin ging and education of 
children.” Wilder,  2000 ME 32, ¶ 20, 748 A.2d at 449  
(quoting Pierce v. Soc’y of Sisters,  268 U.S. 510, 
534–35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) ). See also 
Meyer v. Nebraska,  262 U.S. 390, 399 –400, 43 S.Ct. 
625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) . 
 
 
[¶ 51] When a fundamental liberty interest is at stake, as it 
is here, any st ate invasion of that interest must be subject 
to strict scrutiny. Ante,  ¶ 19 (Court’s opinion); 
Washington v. Glucksberg,  521 U.S. 702, 719 –21, 117 
S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) ; Sch. Admin. Dist. 
No. 1 v. Comm’r, Dep’ t of Educ.,  659 A.2d 854, 857 
(Me.1995) . Under strict scrutiny, invasive state action can 
only be saved if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Ante,  ¶ 19 (Court’s opinion); see 
also Reno v. Flores,  507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 
123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) ; Collins v. City of Harker Heights,  
503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 
(1992) ; Butler v. Supreme Judicia l Court,  611 A.2d 987, 
992 (Me.1992) . 
  
[¶ 52] The challenge of justifying government invasion of 
the rights of fit parents is particularly great because the 
United States Supreme Court has observed that the 
government has only a “de minimis”  interest in child care 
decision making by a fit parent. See Stanley v. Illinois,  
405 U.S. 645, 657 –58, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 
(1972) . Reflective of th is “de minimis” state interest, 
“there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best 
interests of their children.” Troxel,  530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2062  (citing Parham v. J.R.,  442 U.S. 584, 602, 
99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979 )). 
  
[¶ 53] The strict scrutiny test, the requirement that an 
invasion of parental rights be narrowly tailored and 
justified by a compelling state interest, and the 
presumption that fit parents act in the best interest of their 
children all cannot be a voided by a generalized statement 
that “[a] statute is presumed to be constitutional and the 
person challenging the constitutionality has the burden of 
establishing its infirmity.” Ante,  ¶ 14 (Court’s opinion). 
When the State undertakes intrusive regulatio n of the 
family, “the usual judicial deference to the legislature is 
inappropriate.” Moore v. City of E. Cleveland,  431 U.S. 
494, 499, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) . 
Application of the strict scrutiny test demands 
justification of state action by demonstrating that it is 
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, not 
abdication of rigorous analysis by resort to a presumption.  
  
[¶ 54] At fir st blush the Grandparents Visitation Act 
evokes images of Norman Rockwell’s America: what 
some believe were better, simpler family times. The harsh 
reality of this law in application is closer to Orwell23 than 
Rockwell. Except in cases of a deceased or disappeared 
parent, the law will onl y be invoked by grandparents 
whose relationship with their own children has failed so 
badly that they must resort to lawsuits to visit the 
relationship problems with their children on the next 
generation. Where parent -grandparent lifestyle choices 
differ a nd relationships *310  are strained, the law presents 
the prospect of competent parents being caught in a 
withering crossfire of lawsuits by as many as four sets of 
grandparents demanding involvement in the 
grandchildrens ’ lives.24 These suits will be resolved by 
judges applyi ng a law which provides virtually no 
guidance except the “best interest” standard. That 
standard delegates to judges authority to apply their own 
Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291 (2000)

 personal and essentially unreviewable lifestyle 
preferences to resolving each dispute. See Troxel,  530 
U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2064.  Each such resolution, 
successful for the grandparents, will usurp the parents’ 
authority over the child and unavoidably insert the stress 
of litigation, dispute, and uncertainty into the 
grandchildren’s lives.

24 
 The number four would occur if each grandparent 
divorced and remarried. The number could be greater 
where, as here, the family that is the target of litigation 
includes several children by different fathers.  
 
 
[¶ 55] As the trial court observed in its opi nion:  
The reason these type of suits are brought are because 
hostility between the parent and grandparent exist in 
these, the most dysfunctional of cases. The economic 
consequences of the action could be disastrous to the 
parent and, derivatively, the chil d. As written, there is 
no real barrier to prevent a grandparent, who has more 
time and money than the child’s parents, from 
petitioning the court for visitation rights. A parent who 
does not have the up -front out -of-pocket expense to 
defend against the gr andparent’s petition may have to 
bow under the pressure even if the parent honestly 
believes it is not in the best interest of the child. The 
awarding of attorney fees post -hearing does not provide 
a parent with the out -of-pocket expenses required 
before a ny petition is filed or any hearing has begun. 
Such suits cannot ethically be taken on a contingent 
fee. If a parent were required to defend against such 
suit they may have to make sacrifices that are 
detrimental to the child. For example, instead of being  
able to buy the child a winter jacket the parent may 
have to pay an up -front fee to the attorney. Absent a 
showing of harm to the child when the grandparent 
petitions the court for a hearing the parent should not 
be forced to make these sacrifices.  
  
[¶ 5 6] To add insult to injury, the Act presents the 
prospect that parents resisting grandparents’ efforts to 
usurp parental authority may be forced to pay the 
grandparents’ costs and attorney fees. See 19–A M.R.S.A. 
§ 1803(6) (1998) .25 This prospect can greatly add to the 
pressures and stress of litigation, and must be soberly 
considered as the constitutional validity of this law is 
examined.  
 25 
 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(6)  states:  
6. Cost and fees. The court may award costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for defending or 
prosecuting actions under this chapter.  
19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(6) (1998) . 
 
 
[¶ 57] Proper constitutional analysis requires that we ask 
the following questions:  
1. Does the State have a compelling interest in 
authorizing lawsuits by grandparents who have failed 
in relationships with their own children in order to 
gain access to their children’s children; and  
2. If so, is the means selected, the Grandparents 
Visitation Act, sufficiently narrowly tail ored to serve 
that interest?  
  
[¶ 58] On the first point, the Court has apparently found 
“compelling” a state interest which the United States 
Supreme Court has called “de minimis.”26 For purposes of 
this opinion only, some compelling state interest in 
legislating to protect de facto parents as addressed in th e 
Court’s opinion will be assumed and not addressed *311  
further. However, the means selected to achieve that 
assumed compelling state interest do not meet the 
requirement that they be narrowly tailored to serve that 
particular interest.  
 26 
 See Stanley v. Illinois,  405 U.S. 645, 657 –58, 92 S.Ct. 
1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)  (stating that the 
government has only a “de minimis” interest in 
child -care dec ision making by a fit parent).  
 
 
[¶ 59] The law provides that:  
— Any grandparent can file a lawsuit and haul the 
parents into court to defend their parental prerogative 
to control third party access to their children.  
— Except where a parent has died,27 grandparents 
filing suits need demonstrate no particular 
relationship between the grandparent and the child. 
An expressed desire to establish a relationship is all 
that is needed to open the courthouse door.28

 The deceased parent provision of the law, 19–A 
M.R.S.A . § 1803(1)(A) (1998) , is not at issue here, and 
this opinion does not address the constitutionality of 
that provision.

 The provisions of the Grandparents Visitation Act 
implicated in this case are section 1803(1)(B) , 
authorizing lawsuits by grandparents who allege they 
have “a sufficient existing relationship” with a 
grandchild, and section 1803(1)(C)  authorizing lawsuits

 where there is no existing relationship, but the 
grandparents allege they have made an effort to 
establish a relationship. 19 M.R.S.A. § 1803(1)(B), 
(1)(C). Subparagraph B is asserted to apply to Keiko 
and Roman. Su bparagraph C must apply to Mariah, 
who the trial court found to have a relationship only 
“derivatively” because of the relationships with the 
other children and because she had some relationship 
with the grandparents in the first three months of her 
life—now seven years ago. This relationship is 
certainly not a “sufficient existing relationship” under 
subparagraph B unless we strain the definition of that 
term beyond the breaking point. In fact, considering the 
complete lack of an existing relationship whic h the trial 
court found, a relationship that has been non -existent 
for all the children since 1994, subparagraph C is the 
only proper basis to press the claim to force access to 
all three children. A past failed relationship is not a 
“sufficient existing r elationship,” unless this term in 
subparagraph B is given a meaning outside the common 
understanding of the term.  
 
 
— Grandparent access decisions are to be 
adjudicated based on the amorphous “best interest of 
the child” standard, and decided according to  the 
preponderance of the evidence burden of proof.  
[¶ 60] Troxel  indicates that such an open -ended invitation 
to grandparent lawsuits is too broad to meet due process 
requirements. The Troxel  plurality holds such authority to 
be too broad because it gives  the government, acting 
through the courts, virtually unfettered discretion to 
supersede parental decisions as to what is best for their 
children without any special weight being given to the 
parents’ determination to deny access. See Troxel,  530 
U.S. at –––– , 120 S.Ct. at 2062 . 
  
[¶ 61] The findings required by  Maine law that visitation 
“would not significantly interfere with any parent -child 
relationship or with the parent’s rightful authority over the 
child,” 19–A M.R.S.A. § 1803(3) , do not provide 
sufficient qualification to save the statute. Any lawsuit by 
grandparents against parents seeking court intervention to 
force access to the grandchildren is a significant 
interference with the parent -child relationshi p and the 
parent’s rightful authority over the child. Trial courts can 
make the “no significant interference” finding only by 
engaging in a sophistry that such lawsuits have 
insignificant impact.  
  
[¶ 62] As Justice Kennedy’s dissent in Troxel  notes, an 
act authorizing a lawsuit by third parties to intervene in 
the parent -child relationship is, by itself, a “state 
intervention that is so disruptive of the parent -child 
relationship that the constitutional right of a custodial parent to make certain basic det erminations for the child’s 
welfare becomes implicated.” Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 120 
S.Ct. a t 2079  (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Thus, as a matter 
of law, a lawsuit invoking the Grandparents Visitation 
Act, with all its implications, is a significant interference 
in the parent -child relationship. Further, where a fit parent 
has decided against gr andparent access for *312  reasons 
which, as a matter of law, are presumed to be in the 
child’s best interest, see id. 530 U.S. at ––––  – –––– , 120 
S.Ct. at 2061 –62, a court order imposing an association 
that the parent opposes is unavoidably a severe insult to 
the parent’ s rightful authority over the child.  
  
[¶ 63] The plurality opinion in Troxel  directs that rather 
than disregarding the parents’ own determination, the 
court must give it special weight. Id. 530 U.S. at –––– , 
120 S.Ct. at 2062.  If a trial court gives the parent’s own 
determination regarding access to their children the 
special weight require d, then making the “no significant 
interference” findings cited by the Court to save the 
statute29 is a legal and logical impossibility.  
 29 
 Ante,  ¶ 32 (Court’s opinion).  
 
 
[¶ 64] The history of this case demonstrates the 
importance of respecting fit parents’  associational choices 
and recognizing the mischief promoted by the Act’s 
authorizing lawsuits to interfere with those choices. The 
Riendeaus have now been married for eight years. There 
is no dispute in this record that, presently, they are fit 
parents fo r the children. The trial court’s findings note the 
difficulties the marriage has had, primarily as a result of 
attempted interference by the grandparents since 1992:  
They separated during the summer of 1993, primarily 
because of the tensions created by Ro se’s [the 
grandmother’s] interference in their family unit .... As 
the communications broke down finally between Rose 
and Heaven, Rose resorted to reporting Jeffrey to the 
police, resulting in a search warrant being executed on 
their house. In addition, sh e filed a report with the 
Department of Human Services, alleging abuse and 
neglect, and filed two suits against the defendant: an 
action in the Probate Court to adopt Keiko, and the 
instant case. All communications have since broken 
off, and plaintiffs are  not getting any visitation or 
communication with the three children.  
  
[¶ 65] With this history, the parents’ decision to limit 
association of their children with the grandparents is 
hardly surprising. Rather, it appears a legitimate 
expression of self -respect and family integrity. As the trial 
court found: “If this question were posed to the court in 
1994, the conclusion would be inescapable that visitation

 would inject Rose too closely into the defendants’ family 
unit, with catastrophic effect.” This fin ding is essentially a 
finding that there was no “sufficient existing relationship” 
between the grandparents and the children in 1994, a year 
before suit was filed. It makes application of section 
1803(1)(B)  conceptually difficult.  
  
[¶ 66] The remainder of the trial court’s opinion appears 
to look at the visitation prospects from the point of view 
of the grandparents and the children to determine that 
some v isitation might be appropriate, except for the 
constitutional problem. This analysis ignores the direction 
of Troxel  that a special, elevated level of consideration be 
given to the parents’ views on these issues. The trial court 
thought it necessary to inc lude in its order a specific 
prohibition on the grandparents making derogatory 
comments about the parents. This confirms that the court 
was not fully confident of its determination that the 
visitation order would not significantly interfere with the 
parent -child relationship or the parents’ rightful authority 
over the children.  
  
[¶ 67] Thus, beyond the constitutionality problem, the 
Court could not legitimately order visitation in light of its 
findings regarding: (i) the horrible relationship between 
the p arents and the grandparents; (ii) the grandparents’ 
continued efforts to interfere in the parents and their 
children’s lives; and (iii) the appropriateness of the 
severance of the grandparent -child relationship well 
before suit was filed. With the directiv e in Troxel  properly 
applied —a directive which the trial court did not have 
when it rendered its decision — *313  the findings made 
by the trial court itself demonstrate that if the reasons for 
the parents’ decision  are given special and elevated 
consideration, an award of visitation rights to the 
grandparents cannot be supported under section 1803(3) . 
Where the pare nts had legitimate reasons, found by the 
court, for terminating access to grandparents who had 
engaged in a four -year effort to interfere with and disrupt 
the parent -child relationships of the Riendeau family, it is 
evident that a no significant interferen ce finding cannot be 
made on the present record.  
  
[¶ 68] It is possible to posit a statute, much more narrowly 
drawn, that could survive a constitutional challenge and meet the requirements that a compelling state interest be 
properly defined with any rem edy narrowly tailored to 
serve that interest. Such a statute could include a 
prerequisite finding of harm to the child from a parent’s 
denial of some association with a grandparent. As a 
prerequisite for filing suit, the statute might also require, 
as the Court’s opinion suggests, some demonstration of a 
prior parent -like relationship with the child, not just an 
aspirational hope that a relationship might be created, or 
an allegation of some minimal relationship, which is all 
the present law requires. See 19–A M.R.S.A. § 
1803(1)(B), (1)(C) (1998) . The law might also require a 
heightened burden of proof and some other provision to 
respect the direction of Troxel that a fit parent’s decisions 
be given some special, heightened weight.  
  
[¶ 69]  Except for the deceased parent prerequisite which 
is not implicated here, the Grandparents Visitation Act, as 
presently drafted, includes none of the prerequisites which 
would be essential (i) to properly define the compelling 
State interest to support in terference with the fundamental 
liberty interest of parents to control their children; and (ii) 
to narrowly tailor any remedy to serve that interest. The 
present act presents an open invitation for grandparents 
who claim or hope to claim a relationship wit h a 
grandchild to file a lawsuit and have their claim or hope 
adjudicated according to the “best interest” standard, a 
standard which Troxel  indicates is not enough to save 
constitutionality. This case is distinguishable from Troxel  
only by the Maine Act’s  requirement of subsidiary 
findings of “no significant impact” that cannot be made 
except by taking the facially incredible view that such 
lawsuits have no significant impact on the target parents 
and children. Proper application of the strict scrutiny tes t 
and due process protections requires more.  
  
[¶ 70] Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment.
