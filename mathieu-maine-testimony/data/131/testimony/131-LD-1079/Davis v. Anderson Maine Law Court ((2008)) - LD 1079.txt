Opinion  
 
GORMAN , J.  
[¶ 1] Robi n Anderson appeals from an order granting her 
son’s paternal grandparents’ motion to intervene in the 
parental rights and responsibilities case brought by her 
son’s father, Jeffrey A. Davis, entered in the District 
Court (West Bath, Field, J.).  Anderson co ntends that: (1) 
her interlocutory appeal should be heard because it meets 
the death knell exception to the final judgment rule; (2) 
the court erred in granting the grandparents’ motion; and 
(3) 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B) (2007)  is unconstitutional 
because it infringes on parents’ fundamental rights.1 We 
agree that this interlocutory appeal meets the death knell 
exception to the final judgment rule. We vaca te the order 
allowing the Davises to intervene and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 None of the mother’s other arguments merit our 
discussion.  
 
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 2] Robin Anderson gave birth to a son in June 2002, 
when she was a teenager. The child’s father is Jeffrey A. 
Davis. Robin and Jeffrey had an abusive relationship and 
are no longer together. Robin is a recovering drug addict 
and Jeffrey has spent time in jail, twice for gross sexual 
assault and once for burglary.  
  
[¶ 3] Until their son was eighteen months old, Robin, 
Jeffrey, and their child resided with Jeffrey’s parents, 
Shirley and Eric Davis Sr. In January 2004, Robin moved 
out with the child, stayed with her mother for a brief time, 
and then moved into her own apartment for a year and a 
half. During that time, she and Jeffrey agreed that they 
would alternate providing primary residence for the child 
on a weekly basis. Because Jeffrey was living with h is 
parents, the Davises cared for the child during the weeks 
Jeffrey was working and providing the child’s primary 
residence. When Jeffrey went to jail in the summer of 
2004, Robin became the child’s only primary caretaker.  
  
[¶ 4] Jeffrey was released fro m jail in September 2006. 
Robin and the child again lived with Jeffrey at the 
Davises’ home for a short period of time because Robin 
was struggling with her drug addiction. In January 2007, 
Robin moved out, taking the child with her.  
  
[¶ 5] In March 2007,  Jeffrey filed a parental rights and 
Davis v. Anderson, 953 A.2d 1166 (2008)   
2008 ME 125

 responsibilities action against Robin. The Davises filed a 
motion to intervene in that case pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 
24(a) , seek ing an order of parental rights pursuant to 
19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(C) (2007) . The Davises soon 
amended that motion to allege that they were de facto 
parents of the minor child. On the eve of trial, they again 
amended their motion, this time requesting visitation 
*1169  pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803 (2007)  
(Grandparents Visitation Act).  
  
[¶ 6] In June 2007, the court held a hearing to determine 
whether the grandparents could intervene in the parental 
rights and responsibilities matter. At the hearing, Robin 
testified that she was working full -time, had been clean 
and sober for seven months, and was living in a stable 
home. She consented to supervised visitation for the 
grandparents at a time and place that was convenient for 
her within the confines of her work schedule. Robin also 
testified that she wanted their visitation to be supervised. 
The Davises argued at the hearing that they were seeking 
contact with the child pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 
1653(2)(B) . Their petition requested parental rig hts and 
responsibilities pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(C) , 
but they did not wish to be required to establish jeopardy 
at such an initial stage of the proceedings.  
  
[¶ 7] After the hearing, the court issued an order allowing 
the Davises to intervene on the issues of contact pursuant 
to 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2 )(B) and parental rights and 
responsibilities pursuant to section 1653(2)(C) .2 The court 
also granted Jeffrey’s motion to appoint a guardian ad 
litem in the case and ordered the grandparents to pay all 
costs related to the guardian. The court ordered that Robin 
would continue to provide the child’s primary residence.  
 2 
 In its order, the court also dismissed the Davises’ 
motion for intervention pursuant to the Grandparents 
Visitation Act because it requires a separate and distinct 
filing and contains its own proced ural requirements.  
 
 
[¶ 8] Robin filed this interlocutory appeal, contending that 
the motion court erred in granting the grandparents’ 
motion to intervene and challenging the constitutionality 
of 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B) . 
  
 
 
II. DISCUSSION  
 A. Final Judgment Rule  
 [¶ 9] “An order establishing that a party has standing is 
not a final order and ordinarily, pursuant to the final 
judgment rule, is not immediately appealable. ” 
Passalaqua v. Passalaqua,  2006 ME 123, ¶ 7, 908 A.2d 
1214, 1217.  In order to be cogn izable, appeals must be 
taken from a final judgment. Bruesewitz v. Grant,  2007 
ME 13, ¶ 5,  912 A.2d 1255, 1257.  An interlocutory 
appeal is immediately reviewable only if it falls within 
one of three, well -established exceptions: the death knell 
exception, the judicial economy exception, or the 
collateral order exception. State v. Me. State Employees 
Ass’n,  482 A.2d 461, 464 –65 (Me.1984) . 
  
 [¶ 10] “The death knell exception allows an immediate 
appeal from an interlocutory order when substantial rights 
of a party will be irreparably lost if review is delayed until 
final judgment.” Passalaqua,  2006 ME 123, ¶ 9, 908 A.2d 
at 1217  (quotation marks omitted). “A right is irreparably 
lost if the appellant woul d not have an effective remedy if 
the interlocutory determination were to be vacated after a 
final disposition of the entire litigation.” Id. (quotation 
marks omitted). In Passalaqua,  the District Court held 
that the grandmother who fil ed a petition for visitation 
rights pursuant to the Grandparents Visitation Act, 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1803 , had established a sufficient relationship 
with her gr andchildren, denied the mother’s motion to 
dismiss the petition, and ordered the case to proceed to a 
hearing. Id. ¶¶ 3–5, 908 A.2d at 1215 –16. In that case, we 
dismissed the mother’s interlocutory appeal of the motion 
court’s order. Id. ¶ 1, 908 A.2d at 1215.  In determining 
*1170  that the mother’s appeal did not meet the death 
knell exception to the final judgment rule, we reasoned:  
Altho ugh we recognize that the standing determination 
is an important prerequisite to forcing parents to litigate 
grandparent visitation, we are nevertheless satisfied 
that vigilant application of all the safeguards provided 
in the Act will adequately protect p arents’ substantial 
rights.  In addition, permitting an exception to the final 
judgment rule in these cases would result in interrupted 
proceedings and undue delay, and would not constitute 
the best use of limited judicial resources. We therefore 
conclude t hat a decision that a grandparent has standing 
pursuant to section 1803(1)(B)  is not immediately 
appealable.  
Id. ¶ 3, 908 A.2d at 1218  (emphasis added).  
  
[¶ 11] As the quoted language explains, we were satisfied 
in that case that the procedural safeguards contained in 
the Grandparents Visitation Act were sufficient to test 
whether “imposing the burden of litigation on the parent 
is justified by a compelling state interest.” Id. ¶ 11, 908 
A.2d at 1217.  The requirement for that level of scrutiny 
was premised on our holding in Rideout v. Riendeau,  
Davis v. Anderson, 953 A.2d 1166 (2008)   
2008 ME 125  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  3 
 2000 ME 198, 761 A.2d 291,  where we recognized that 
the Grandparents Visitation Act “provides a mechanism 
by which the State may intervene in the basic exercise of 
parents’ rights to determine the care and custody of their 
children.” See id. ¶ 21, 761 A.2d at 300 . Because this 
mechanism constitutes state involvement in a way that 
clearly implicates parents’ fundamental liberty interests, 
we held that the State is required to demonstrate that its 
actions serve a compelling state interes t in order to pass 
constitutional muster. Id. ¶ 22, 761 A.2d at 300.  We 
affirmed a holding that had been in place for sixty years 
to reiterate that a parent’s right to care for and control his 
or her child should be limited only for the most urgent 
reasons. See id.  ¶ 24, 761 A.2d at 301  (citing Merchant v. 
Bussell,  139 Me. 118, 122, 27 A.2d 816, 818 (1942) ). 
  
[¶ 12] In this case, the motion court granted the 
grandparents’ motion for intervention pursuant to M.R. 
Civ. P. 24(a)(2)  and 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B), (C) . The 
court specifically rejected Robin’ s argument that the 
Davises’ petition should be considered with at least the 
same level of scrutiny as that required for a petition under 
the Grandparents Visitation Act. In so doing, the court 
erred.  
  
[¶ 13] Recently, in Conlogue v. Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, 
890 A.2d 691,  we again discussed what state interests are 
important enough to justify a court’s intrusion into family 
life pursuant t o the Grandparents Visitation Act, and held 
that “the death of one parent in itself is not an urgent 
reason that justifies forcing the surviving parent into 
litigation under the Act.” See id.  ¶ 22, 890 A.2d at 699 . 
We also noted that protecting the best interests of a child 
is not a compelling state interest. Id. ¶ 20, 890 A.2d at 
699. We held that “forcing parents to defend against a 
claim for grandparent visitation is itsel f an infringement 
of their fundamental right to make decisions concerning 
the custody and control of their children. Such an 
infringement is subject to strict scrutiny, and must be 
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Id. 
¶ 16, 890 A.2d at 697 . 
  
 [¶ 14] Both Passalaqua  and Conlogue  mandate the 
protection of parents’ fundamental rights in the context of 
potentially burdensome litigation brought by grandparents 
requesting contact. When third parties, including 
grandparents, petition for contact or for parental rights 
and responsi bilities pursuant to section 1653(2)(B) or (C) , 
the parents’ rights must be protected at least as well as 
they are *1171  when grandparents pursue an action for 
visitation pursuant to section 1803 . For that reason, a 
request for access to children pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 
1653  must be considered with at least the same level of 
scrutiny.    
 [¶ 15] In an action brought under the Grandparents 
Visitation Act, grandparents must make an initial showing 
of the urgent reasons that justify their standing. Conlogue,  
2006 ME 12, ¶ 20, 890 A.2d at 699;  see Rideout,  2000 
ME 198, ¶ 24, 761 A.2d at 301.  In Rideout  we held that 
urgent reasons exist when grandparents have acted as de 
facto parents. 2000 ME 198, ¶ 25, 761 A.2d at 301.  No 
other urgent reasons have yet been identified.  
  
 [¶ 16] Here, although the trial court correctly held a 
limited hearing to determine whether the Davises had 
standing to participate in the family matters action 
pending between their son and the mother of their 
grandchild, it did not apply the correct  level of scrutiny to 
the Davises’ request for contact. Rather than determine 
whether the infringement of Robin’s rights requested by 
the Davises was appropriate because the Davises were, as 
they claimed, the child’s de facto parents, the trial court 
deter mined that the Davises had “sufficient connection 
with the child so that the court should decide whether or 
not it is in [his] best interest to award visitation or 
parental rights and responsibilities to Grandparents.” 
Because the correct level of scrutiny  was not applied, we 
cannot hold here, as we did in Passalaqua,  that there was 
an appropriate application of safeguards adequate to 
protect Robin’s rights as a parent. Robin’s substantial 
rights will be irreparably lost if review is delayed until 
final jud gment; the death knell exception to the final 
judgment rule applies and we will consider Robin’s 
interlocutory appeal.  
  
 
 
B. Grandparents’ Motion for Intervention  
 [¶ 17] In considering a petition to intervene pursuant to 
19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B) ,3 the trial court must first 
determine whether the petitioners have standing to 
participate in the proceeding. In this case, the Davises 
asserted that their standing was based on their status as 
the child’s de facto parents. The threshold question for the 
court, therefore, is whether the Davises can establish that 
they have a parent -like relationship with the child because 
they have “fully and completely undertaken a permanent, 
unequivocal, committed, and responsible parental  role in 
[his] life.” See C.E.W. v. D.E.W.,  2004 ME 43, ¶ 14, 845 
A.2d 1146, 1152  (emphasis added). Such a deter mination 
could, in some cases, be made after a review of affidavits. 
In other cases, the court may hold a hearing similar to the 
one held by the trial court in this case, i.e., a discrete 
hearing focused on providing the court with sufficient 
evidence to d ecide whether the proposed intervenors can 
meet their burden of proof. On remand, the trial court may

2008 ME 125

 rely solely on the evidence already presented in 
determining whether the Davises have met their burden 
or, in its discretion, may decide to allow the part ies to 
supplement that record.  
 3 
 As mentioned above, although the Davises cited section 
1653(2)(C)  in their pleading, their claim at hearing was 
for contact, pursuant to section 1653(2)(B) . 
 
 
 
 
C. Constitutionality of 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B)  
 [¶ 18] Parents have a fundamental liberty interest to 
direct the care, cu stody, and control of their children, 
Troxel v. Granville,  530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 
L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) ; Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 18, 761 
A.2d at 299.  We understand this fundamental right to 
*1172  be firmly established. See, e.g., Pierce v. Soc’y of 
Sisters,  268 U.S. 510, 534 –35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 
1070 (1925) ; Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 18, 761 A.2d at 
299; Osier v. Osier,  410 A.2d 1027, 1029 (Me.1980) . 
Accordingly, so long as a parent adequately cares for 
his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally  be no 
reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm 
of the family to further question the ability of that 
parent to make the best d ecisions concerning the 
rearing of that parent’s children.  
Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 18,  761 A.2d at 299  (quoting 
Troxel,  530 U.S. at 68 –69, 120 S.Ct. 2054).  Robin asks us to find that section 1653(2)(B)  is unconstitutional because 
it infringes upon parents’ constitutionally protected rights 
to direct the care and custody of their children.  
  
 [¶ 19] As we stated in Rideout,  when grandparents have 
acted as the primary caregivers and custodians “for a 
child over a significant period of time, the relationship 
between the child and the grandparent[s] warrants 
application of the court’s parens patriae  authority on 
behalf of the child and provides a compelling basis for the 
State’s int ervention....” Id. ¶ 27, 761 A.2d at 302 . The 
Davises have asserted that they did and do have that type 
of relationship with their grandson. Applying the 
safeguards discussed in that case to the Davises’ request 
for contact pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1653(2)(B)  
provides the same narrowly tailored action to serve the 
previously -identified compelling state interest, and allows 
the statute to be applied cons titutionally to the facts of this 
case.  
  
The entry is:  
  
Order vacated. Remanded to the District Court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
