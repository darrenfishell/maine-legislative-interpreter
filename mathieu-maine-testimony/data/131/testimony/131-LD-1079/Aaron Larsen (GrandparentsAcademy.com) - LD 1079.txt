LD 1079
The bond that can exist between grandparents and their grandchildren is unique and 
essential to their development. I have personally witnessed the devastation that can 
occur when this relationship is denied. I support LD 1079 to allow non-toxic 
grandparents the right to petition for and gain access to their grandchildren.
