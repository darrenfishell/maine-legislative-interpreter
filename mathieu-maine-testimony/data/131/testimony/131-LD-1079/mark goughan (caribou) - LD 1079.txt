This letter is in support of LD1079 regarding mediation and petitioning for grandparents visitation rights. 
 
I’m amazed at how many people I have come upon in the past few years that are going through the 
issue with not being able to visit or have contact with their grandchildren. Personally I have a hard time 
understanding why this is going on in this, not just Maine, but country.  
I own a family farm and I can’t imagine life without my grandchildren there every day. And the same for 
my grandchildren. The experiences we all have had over the years are so important to my wife and I and 
our children and grandchildren.  
We get to see just how important the time grandparents and grandchildren get to spend with each 
other as we are open to the public on the farm we own. I can’t tell you all the wonderful moment we get 
to observe during these times. It makes you understand what life if really all about. Family!! 
There has been so many times, my family and I have talked about seeing the grandchildren and 
grandparents golfing or going through the animal barn, corn maze or just enjoying an ice cream. The 
smiles on their faces and love in their hearts is heartwarming. 
Truly, family is the back bone of this country and all we stand for. The relationship of the grandparents 
with the grandchildren is essential to this country. You know it might be the grandchild that keeps that 
family business going that gramps or gram just can’t run any longer. By the grandparents teaching the 
grandchildren the ropes and work ethic, that is what keeps this family business on going.  
We, as a farm family feel this grandparent law is so important to our next generations of family! 
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.
