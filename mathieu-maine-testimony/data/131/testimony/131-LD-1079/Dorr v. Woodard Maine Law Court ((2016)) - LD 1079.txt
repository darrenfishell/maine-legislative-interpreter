Opinion  
 
SAUFLEY , C.J.  
 [¶ 1] Louise Dorr appeals from a judgment of the District 
Court (Augusta, E. Walker, J. ) dismissin g for lack of 
standing her petition for court -ordered visitation with her 
granddaughter pursuant to the Grandparents Visitation 
Act, 19–A M.R.S. §§ 1801 –1805 (2015) . We conclude 
that Dorr’s petition and affidavit did not demonstrate 
“urgent reasons,” or other compelling interests, sufficient 
to justify the requested intrusion on Woodard’s 
constituti onal right to be free from litigation regarding the 
care, custody, and control of her child. Thus, we affirm 
the court’s dismissal for lack of standing.  
  
 
 
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 2] Sarah Woodard is the mother of the child involved 
in this dispute. The child’s father died less than a year 
after the child’s birth. Dorr is the mother of the child’s 
father.1 There is no evidence that Woodard is an unfit 
parent, or that Woodard’s parenting causes a threat of 
harm to the child. Dorr simply wan ts to be a part of her 
granddaughter’s life.  
 1 
 For purposes of this appeal, we assume that Dorr’s son 
is the child’s father although the record does not 
provide proof of this fact.  
 
 
[¶ 3] On October 24, 2014, Dorr filed a petition in the 
District Court seeking court -ordered visitation with 
Woodard’s child, alleging a sufficient existing 
relationship between herself and the child, or, in the 
alternative, that she had made a sufficient effort to 
establish a relationship. See 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B), 
(C). 
  
[¶ 4] Dorr attached her own affidavit to her petition and 
stated the following facts. Sarah Woodard is the child’s 
mother, and Dorr  is the child’s paternal grandmother. 
Before the child’s birth, Dorr attended a baby shower for 
the child and Woodard. Additionally, Dorr was in the 
hospital on the evening that the child was 
born—September 3, 2012. Dorr had additional, 
unspecified contact  with the child until Dorr’s son died on 
April 19, 2013, when the child was seven months old.2 At 
that time, Woodard ceased contact with Dorr. Dorr 
attempted to maintain contact with Woodard and the 
child, and she hired a mediator to assist in resolving any 
issues. The mediation was unsuccessful. After her son’s 
death, Dorr filed documentation seeking to prove her

 son’s paternity of the child and filed documentation in 
Probate Court naming the child as his beneficiary and 
heir. Dorr hopes that these actions will entitle the child to 
any available Social Security or death benefits.  
 2 
 Dorr’s affidavit states: “ I have written documentation 
of all contact from [the child’s] birth through the death 
of my son Jeff in April of 2013, at which time Sarah 
ceased contact.” However, Dorr did not provide any 
documentation of the alleged contact to the court.  
 
 
[¶ 5] On No vember 3, 2014, Woodard filed a motion to 
dismiss the petition on the grounds that the Act infringes 
on her fundamental right to govern the care, custody, and 
control of her child, and is unconstitutional both on its 
face and as applied under the Due Proce ss Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  
  
[¶ 6] On December 8, 2014, the District Court dismissed 
Dorr’s petition for lack of standing. The court found that 
the affidavit did not establish a sufficient existing 
relationship  with the child or a sufficient effort to 
establish such a relationship, and also did not make an 
initial showing of *470  “urgent reasons” that would 
justify an infringement on the mother’s rights. Dorr 
timely appealed . See 14 M.R.S. § 1901(1) (2015) ; 
M.R.App. P. 2 . 
  
 
 
II. DISCUSSION  
 
A. Standard of Review  
 [¶ 7] Dorr argues that, given the unopposed facts she has 
presented, the plain language of 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(1)(A) –(C) provides her with standing. Woodard 
argues that a finding of standing on these facts would 
interfere with her fundamental liberty interest in raising 
her daughter. We review the court’s determination of a 
grandparent’s standing to petition for visitation rights de 
novo. See, e.g., Robichaud v. Pariseau,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 
10, 820 A.2d 1212 . “A sta tute is presumed to be 
constitutional and the person challenging the 
constitutionality has the burden of establishing its 
infirmity.” Kenny v. Dep’t of Human Servs.,  1999 ME 
158, ¶ 7, 740 A.2d 560 . We will not reach beyond the 
facts in the case before us to decide the constitutionality 
of matters not yet presented. See United States v. Raines,  
362 U.S. 17, 21 –22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) . Therefore, we address the const itutionality of the Act only 
in the context of the facts presented to the District Court 
in Dorr’s initial petition and accompanying affidavit.  
  
 
 
B. The Act  
[¶ 8] In 1991, th e Maine Legislature enacted the 
Grandparents Visitation Act, which grants grandparents a 
statutorily -created right to petition for court -ordered 
visitation with their grandchildren under certain limited 
circumstances. 19–A M.R.S. §§ 1801 –1805 . The Act 
requires that grandparents make an initial showing of 
standing in a petition and accompanying affidavit 
submitted to the court before litigation may commence. 
19–A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(A) . The Act provides that 
grandparents can establish standing in a petition and 
accompanying affidavit by showing one of the following:  
A. At least one of the child’s parents or legal guardians 
has died;  
B. There is a sufficient existing relationship between 
the g randparent and the child; or  
C. When a sufficient existing relationship between the 
grandparent and the child does not exist, a sufficient 
effort to establish one has been made.  
19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(A) –(C). 
  
[¶ 9] Dorr argues that her petition and affidavit were 
sufficient to confer standing under all three sections of the 
Act. Woodard argues that a reading of the Act that would 
confer standing on Dorr violates the Due Process Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution.3 
 3 
 We note that neither party raised arguments concerning 
the Maine constitution and therefore do not address this 
issue. See Rideout v. Riendeau,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 6 n. 3, 
761 A.2d 291 ; see also  Me. Const. art. I, § 6 –A. 
 
 
[¶ 10] We have previously considered the 
constitutionality of sections 1803(1)(A) and 1803(1)(B) of 
the Act. We determined that conferring standing to 
grandparents based on the death of a parent alone, 
pursuant to section 1803(1)(A) , is an unconstitutional 
application of the Act. Conlogue v. Conlogue,  2006 ME 
12, ¶ 22, 890 A.2d 691 . Conferring standing based on a 
sufficient existing relationship between the grandparent 
and the child, pursuant to section 1803(1)(B) , can be 
constitutional as applied, depending on the facts alleged 
in the petition and accompanying affidavit. See Rideout v. 
Dorr v. Woodard, 140 A.3d 467 (2016)   
2016 ME 79  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  3 
 Riendeau,  2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 27 –28, 761 A.2d 291 ; *471  
Robichaud,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 . We have 
not yet considered the constitutionality of section 
1803(1)(C) ; its constitutionality presents a question of 
first impression.  
  
 
 
C. Constitutional Considerations  
[¶ 11] This case calls upon us to balance the fundamental, 
constitutionally recognized right of fit parents to be free 
from litigation by third parties concerning the care, 
custody, and control of their children against the 
statutorily created right of grandparents to petition for 
court -ordered visitation with their grandchildren.  
  
 [¶ 12] “It is well established that, pursuant to the 
substantive due process component of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, parents have a fundamental liberty interest 
in making decisions concerning the care, custody, and 
control of their children.” Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 12, 
890 A.2d 691 . “[F]orcing parents  to defend against a 
claim for grandparent visitation is itself an infringement 
of their fundamental right to make decisions concerning 
the custody and control of their children.” Id. ¶ 16. 
Grandparents, on the other hand, “do not have a common 
law or cons titutional right of access to their 
grandchildren.” Robichaud,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 11, 820 A.2d 
1212. 
  
 [¶ 13] Nonetheless, the right of parents to make 
decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of 
their children is not absolute. See McNicholas v. Bickford,  
612 A.2d 866, 870 (Me.1992) . Rather, the Cons titution 
provides “heightened protection against state intervention 
in parents’ fundamental right to make decisions 
concerning the care, custody, and control of their 
children.” Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 19, 761 A.2d 291 . We 
have previously determined that the Act provides a 
mechanism by which the State may interfe re with this 
fundamental right. Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 16, 890 
A.2d 691 . It is the heig htened protection against this State 
interference that mandates strict scrutiny of the Act. Id. ¶ 
13. Therefore, all provisions of the Act that confer 
standing on grandparents must be narrowly tailored to 
serve a compelling state interest. See Rideout,  2000 ME 
198, ¶ 19, 761 A.2d 291 ; Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 16, 
890 A.2d 691 . 
  
[¶ 14] Because the Act must survive strict scrutiny, the 
Act contains certain safeguards. See 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(2) . Relevant here, a grandparent must demonstrate 
standing to petition for visitation rights before litigation may commence. 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(A) –(D). To 
demonstrate standing, a grandparent must establish one of 
three statutory requirements. 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(1)(A) –(C). Additionally, in order for the Act to 
survive strict scrutiny, the grandparent must demonstrate 
a compelling state interest that provides a basis for 
interference with a parent’s fundamental right. See 
Robichaud,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 8, 820 A.2d 1212 . 
  
 [¶ 15] We have consistently held that such a compelling 
interest exists when there is a threat of harm to the child 
or the parent is unfit.4 See In re Shannon R.,  461 A.2d 
707, 711 –12 (Me.1983) ; In re Ashley A.,  679 A.2d 86, 
89–90 (Me.1996) . Regarding a fit parent, however,  “so 
long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children 
(i.e., is fit), there will normally  be no reason for the State 
to inject itself into the private realm of the family to 
further *472  question the ability of that parent to make the 
best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent’s 
children.” Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 18, 761 A.2d 291  
(quoting Troxel v. Granv ille, 530 U.S. 57, 68 –69, 120 
S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) ). 
 4 
 In circumstances where a parent is unfit or there is a 
threat of harm to the child, there are several other 
statutory procedures that grandparents could pursue to 
obtain various degrees of legal rights over their 
grandchildren. See Child and Family Services and 
Child Protection Act, 22 M.R.S. §§ 4001  to 4099 –H 
(2015) ; 18–A M.R.S. §§ 5 –201 to 5–213 (2015)  
(guardians of minors); 18–A M.R.S. § § 9–301 to 9–315 
(2015)  (adoption).  
 
 
 [¶ 16] Thus, despite the benefits to a child that could 
accompany a healthy and loving relationship with the 
child’s grandparents, it will be difficult for a grandparent 
to demonstrate a compelling state interest sufficient to 
infringe on a fit parent’s fundamental right when there is 
no threat of harm to the child. Such an intrusion in the 
context of a petition for court -ordered grandparent 
visitation will be court -enforced only when the 
grandparent demonstrates “urgent reasons”5 for the 
intrusion. Id. ¶ 24.  
 5 
 “Urgent reasons” and “exceptional circumstances” are 
synonymous in this context. See Gordius v. Kelley,  
2016 ME 77, ¶ 18, 139 A.3d 928  (Saufley, C.J., 
concurring); see also Pitts v. Moore,  2014 ME 59, ¶ 12 
n. 3, 90 A.3d 1169 . Here, we reference “urgent 
reasons”  to be consistent with prior jurisprudence 
regarding petitions for court -ordered grandparent 
visitation. See, e.g., Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 24, 761 
A.2d 291 . 
 
 
[¶ 17] Because the State’s interest in intruding on a 
Dorr v. Woodard, 140 A.3d 467 (2016)   
2016 ME 79  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  4 
 parent’s fundamental right derives from its responsibility 
to assure the health and safety of the child, the focus of 
any “ urgent reasons” must be on the child’s needs, not the 
grandparent’s interests. See id.  ¶ 26. The broad standard 
of the best interest of the child is itself not an “urgent 
reason” that would justify intrusion on a parent’s rights; 
“something more ... must b e at stake.” Conlogue,  2006 
ME 12, ¶ 17, 890 A.2d 691  (quotation marks omitted). To 
date,  the only “urgent reason” that we have articulated for 
the intrusion upon a fit parent’s rights and grant of 
court -ordered visitation is the child’s need for continued 
contact with a grandparent who has been a primary 
caregiver and custodian for a signific ant part of the 
child’s life. Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 25, 761 A.2d 291 ; 
Davis v. Anderson,  2008 ME 125, ¶ 19, 953 A.2d 1166 . 
  
 
 
D. Dorr’s Petition  
[¶ 18] Against this backdrop, Dorr urges us to conclude 
that her limited contact and her efforts to expand that 
contact, taken as true for the purpose of this preliminary 
proceeding, were sufficient to confer standing pursuant to 
sections 1803(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act. We discuss 
each section in turn.  
  
 [¶ 19] Regarding section 1803(1)(A) , the death of a 
parent in and of itself, without a showing of “urgent 
reasons,” threat of harm to the child, or some other 
compelling interest, is not enough to confer standing 
under the Act. Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 22, 890 A.2d 
691. 
  
 [¶ 20] Concerning section 1803(1)(B) , which confers 
standing when there is a “sufficient existing relationship 
between the grandparent and the c hild,” the “ ‘urgent 
reasons’ standard presupposes extraordinary contact 
between a grandparent and grandchildren to satisfy the 
constitutional requirement of a compelling state interest to 
interfere with parents’ right to care for and control their 
childre n.” Robichaud,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 ; 
see also Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 27, 761 A.2d 291 . The 
facts alleged in the petition and affidavi t—that Dorr 
attended a baby shower for the child and Woodard before 
the child’s birth, was in the hospital the evening the child 
was born, and had some unspecified amount of contact 
with the child before the child’s father died —do not 
demonstrate extraordi nary contact and do not establish a 
sufficient existing relationship to confer standing. See 
19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B) ; *473  Robichaud,  2003 ME 
54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 ; Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 27, 
761 A.2d 291 . 
   [¶ 21] Section 1803(1)(C) of the Act permits a 
grandparent to petition for visitation if a “sufficient 
effort” to establish a relationship between the grandparent 
and the child has been made. 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(C) . 
We address this section of the Act for the first time. In 
order to have standing , Dorr must demonstrate first that 
she has met that statutory standard, and second that there 
is a compelling state interest, such as “urgent reasons,” to 
justify intrusion on Woodard’s fundamental rights. See 
Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 22, 890 A.2d 691 ; Robichaud,  
2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 ; Rideout,  2000 ME 
198, ¶ 27, 761 A.2d 291 . 
  
[¶ 22] Dorr’s petition and affidavit allege that Dorr 
attempted to maintain contact with Woodard and the child 
after the death of her son, hired a mediator to assist in 
resolving any issues, and made efforts to secure 
inheritance rights and Social Security and death benefits 
for the child. We must a cknowledge that, where the 
child’s father died when the child was less than one year 
old, there was little else Dorr could have done to 
demonstrate a sufficient effort to establish a relationship 
with the infant. For standing purposes, therefore, we 
assume  that her efforts met the statutory requirement.  
  
[¶ 23] We must also determine, however, whether 
granting Dorr standing to petition for visitation based on 
this “sufficient effort,” pursuant to section 1803(1)(C) , 
would be consistent with the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. See Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 17, 
761 A.2d 291 . As stated above, regarding a fit parent, 
where there is no threat of harm to the child, we  have 
previously found “urgent reasons” only when the 
grandparent has functioned as primary caregiver and 
custodian. Id. ¶ 27; Davis,  2008 ME 125, ¶ 19, 953 A.2d 
1166 . We have thus far declined to recognize other 
“urgent reasons.”  
  
[¶ 24] It is possible that in some circumstances, a 
grandparent’s “sufficient effort to establish”  a relationship 
with her grandchild could pass constitutional muster and 
demonstrate “urgent reasons” to intrude on a parent’s 
fundamental rights. However, “[w]e are not called upon 
here to define all instances where a compelling interest 
could be demonstr ated.... We need only look to the facts 
before us to determine whether that level of interest 
exists.” Rideout,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 24, 761 A.2d 291 . 
Assuming section 1803(1)(C)  can in some circumstances 
be applied in a constitutional manner, we nonetheless 
conclude that, here, the facts are insufficient to 
demonstrate “urgent reasons,” or other compelling 
interests based on the child’s needs, to justify intrusion on 
Woodard’s fund amental right to be free from litigation 
regarding the care, custody, and control of her child.

2016 ME 79

[¶ 25] Because we have assumed without deciding that a 
grandparent could under some circumstances show a 
“sufficient effort to establish” a relationship that would 
pass constitutional muster, we do not address Woodard’s 
argument, raised only in the trial court, that the Act is 
unconstitutional on its face. See Guardianship of 
Chamberlain,  2015 ME 76, ¶ 10, 118 A.3d 229  (“[A] 
facial challenge will be considered only if there is a 
reasoned argument that a challenged statute cannot be 
applied constit utionally on any set of facts.” (emphasis 
added)); United States v. Salerno,  481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 
S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987)  (stating that under a 
facial challenge, “the challenger must establish that no set 
of circumstances exists under which the Act would be 
valid”); cf. Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, ¶ 5, 890 A.2d 691  
*474  (declining to address a facial challenge to the 
constitutionality of the Act and noting “nothing in the Act 
limits grandparent visitation petitions to situations where 
the child is in the custody of a biological or adoptive 
parent”).  
  
[¶ 26] Although we do not address a facial challenge, we 
agree with the  dissent that legislative action concerning 
the Act is called for. In order to construe the Act in 
accordance with the Constitution, our decisions have, 
over time, limited the scope of the Act when a 
grandparent is seeking to impose court -ordered visitatio n 
against the wishes of a fit parent. See Dissenting Opinion 
¶¶ 29, 34, 36. Thus, the language of the Act no longer 
tracks with the applicable law. Families turn to the statute 
for guidance with their disputes, and in many instances 
the litigants in these matters may have little or no access 
to lawyers to assist them in understanding the law. 
Because the Grandparents Visitation Act has been 
effectively and substantially limited by the constitutional 
constraints articulated in our decisions and in the 
decisi ons of the United States Supreme Court, the public 
may be misled in their reading of the statute. The fiscal 
resources, emotional resources, and time of the parties 
may be unfairly wasted if the statute is not amended to 
reflect the constitutional limits i n effect.  
  
[¶ 27] It is uniquely the role of the Legislature to redraft 
statutes when the Constitution has required the courts to 
engraft additional requirements into statutes in order to 
read them constitutionally. See Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, § 
1; Dissenting Opinion ¶ 41. We encourage the Legislature 
to review and amend the Act in the context of the 
constitutional mandates set out by the United States 
Supreme Court in Troxel  and the principles we have set 
out in this decision and prior decisions concerning the 
Act. 
   
 
III. CONCLUSION  
[¶ 28] Children may well benefit from the existenc e of a 
large support system that includes many family members, 
and we sympathize with grandparents who wish to have a 
relationship with their grandchildren but, due to problems 
in the relationship between the parents and grandparents, 
are not able to do so . The question, however, is not 
whether the child could benefit from the involvement of 
her grandmother. The question is whether the State has 
the authority, on the facts presented by Dorr, to intrude on 
the mother’s decision -making on behalf of her daught er. 
Ultimately, the relationship that a grandparent has with 
his or her grandchild is a decision to be made by a fit 
parent, not the courts, unless the record presents a 
compelling reason for the State to intervene. There is no 
evidence on this record to s uggest that the child in this 
case is not well cared for by her mother. The facts alleged 
in the petition and accompanying affidavit are insufficient 
to provide standing to the grandmother without violating 
the constitutional rights of the mother.  
  
The en try is:  
  
Judgment affirmed.  
  
 
 
JABAR , J., dissenting.  
 
[¶ 29] I respectfully dissent because I believe that the 
grandparent in this case presented enough evidence of a 
sufficient effort to establish a relationship with the child 
to demonstrate standing to seek an order of visitation and 
access pursuan t to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(C) (2015) . The 
Court’s interpretations of the Grandparents  Visitation Act 
(Act), 19–A M.R.S. §§ 1801 –1805 (2015) , in this case 
and in prior cases, have rendered it nearly impossible for 
any grandparent to establish standing to take advantage of 
the Act. *475  Under these circumstances, it would be 
better if the Court held the Act facially unconstitutional, 
thereby prompting the Legislature to redraft the Act so 
that its express provisions wou ld afford the requisite 
constitutional protections for the fundamental familial 
rights at stake.  
  
[¶ 30] The Court correctly recognizes that grandparents 
do not have any constitutional or common law rights to

 access their grandchildren. Court’s Opinion ¶ 12; Rideout 
v. Riendeau,  2000 ME 198, ¶ 26 n. 16, 761 A.2d 291 . 
However, grandparents do have statutory rights to petition 
for visitation and access pursuant to the Act. 19–A M.R.S. 
§ 1803 . When the Maine Legislature passed the Act, it 
recognized that children have a right to maintain 
beneficial relationships with their grandparents. In the bill 
that led to passage of the Act, the Legislature stated : “All 
children are entitled to enjoy secure, stable and beneficial 
relationships with their grandparents and to maintain 
these relationships unless they endanger the welfare of the 
child as defined by the child abuse and neglect laws of 
this State.” L.D. 1307, Statement of Fact (115th Legis. 
1991). The judicial forum and remedy created by the Act 
is thus derivative of the interest that children have in 
benefitting from relationships with their grandparents. Id.; 
see also Troxel v. Granville,  530 U.S. 57, 64, 120 S.Ct. 
2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000)  (“[N]onparental visitation 
statutes are ... supp orted by a recognition, which varies 
from State to State, that children should have the 
opportunity to benefit from relationships with statutorily 
specified persons —for example, their grandparents.”); 
Fairbanks v. McCarter,  330 Md. 39, 622 A.2d 121, 126 
(1993)  (“As a general proposition, visitation awarded to 
adults is not for their gratification or enjoyment, but to 
fulfill the needs of the child.”), overruled in part on other 
grounds by Koshko v. Haining,  398 Md. 404, 921 A.2d 
171, 195 (2007) . 
  
[¶ 31] The Act as currently codified sets out three separate 
provisions that afford grandparents the opportunity to 
request court -ordered visitation with a grandchild. Title 
19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)  provides as follows:  
1. Standing to petition for visitation rights.  A 
grandparent of a minor child may petition the court for 
reasonable rights of  visitation or access if:  
A. At least one of the child’s parents or legal 
guardians has died;  
B. There is a sufficient existing relationship between 
the grandparent and the child; or  
C. When a sufficient existing relationship between 
the grandparent and the child does not exist, a 
sufficient effort to establish one has been made.  
  
[¶ 32] This Court’s decisions have rendered it almost 
impossible for a grandparent to establish standing 
pursuant to any one of the foregoing subsections. I  discuss 
the demise of each subsection in turn.  
  
 
 A. Death of a Parent  
[¶ 33] The death knell to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(A)  
occurred when this Court issued its decision in Conlogue 
v. Conlogue,  2006 ME 12, 890 A.2d 691 . Although the 
Court indicated that it was not considering a facial 
challenge to the statute’s constitutionality, id. ¶ 5, its 
decision rendered it well -nigh impossible for grandparents 
to avail themselves of subsection A. “We do not see,” the 
Court concluded, “how the fact of a parental death 
standing alone  can be an urgent reason for a court’s 
interference in family life  over the objections of a 
custodial parent.” Id. ¶ 18.  
  
[¶ 34] Although subsection A establishes a parent’s death 
as the sole factual predicate for a grandparent’s standing 
to *476  pursue court -ordered visitation purs uant to the 
Act, Conlogue  held that a parent’s death alone was not 
enough, id. ¶¶ 18, 22, and that grandparents must also 
bear “the modest burden of making an initial showing of 
the urgent reasons that justify their standing,” id. ¶ 20. 
The statutory predi cate for standing under subsection A is 
simply the death of a parent. The statute does not require 
proof of any additional facts. If the death of a parent alone 
is never sufficient to establish standing to seek 
court -ordered visitation, then the Conlogue  Court should 
have explicitly decided that subsection A is facially 
unconstitutional. Post -Conlogue,  it is nearly impossible 
for a grandparent to use subsection A to request 
court -ordered visitation with a grandchild after the death 
of that child’s parent, e ven though a parental death is all 
that subsection A requires.  
  
 
 
B. Sufficient Existing Relationship  
[¶ 35] Pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B) , a 
grandparent may petition the court for an order granting 
access to a grandchild if “[t]here is a sufficient ex isting 
relationship between the grandparent and the child.” In 
Rideout,  2000 ME 198, 761 A.2 d 291 , the Court 
concluded that a grandparent could establish a “sufficient 
existing relationship” with a grandchild, and thereby 
establish standing to seek contact with the grandchild 
pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B) , by proving that 
the grandparent had served as “ the primary caregiver and 
custodian for [the] child over a significant period of 
time.” See id.  ¶¶ 26 –27 (quotation marks omitted). In his 
concurring opinion, Chief Justice Wathen stated that the 
Court had, by “confining the Act to de facto parents[,] ... 
Dorr v. Woodard, 140 A.3d 467 (2016)   
2016 ME 79  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  7 
 unnecessarily stripp[ed] the Act of any significance 
beyond the limited results that could be achieved at 
common law.” Id. ¶ 40.  
  
[¶ 36] Rideout  and this Court’s subsequent decisions that 
equate the “sufficient existing relationship” contemplated 
by 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B)  with the “primary 
caregiver and custodian” relationship required to establish 
de facto parenthood have rendered it extremely difficult, 
if not impossible, for a grandparent to establish standing 
pursuant to subsection B. See, e.g., Robichaud v. 
Pariseau,  2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212  (concluding 
that a grandmother did not have standing pursuant to 
subsection B when her contact with her grandchildren was 
“not extraordinary”).  
  
[¶ 37] There are many relationships between a 
grandparent and a grandchild that are less involved than 
the relationship between a primary caregiver and 
custodian and a child, and the Act does not make any 
distinctions between these v arying degrees of 
involvement. Pursuant to the language of subsection B, a 
grandparent establishes standing to petition for visitation 
by demonstrating that he or she has a “sufficient existing 
relationship” with the grandchild in question. The Court’s 
decision to equate this relational requirement with the 
extraordinary involvement inherent in a primary 
caregiving and custodial relationship frustrates the 
Legislature’s intent. The Legislature, by passing the Act, 
created a vehicle for grandparents to gain rights of access 
and visitation with their grandchildren, not a vehicle for 
obtaining the broad panoply of rights that a party may 
obtain through other procedural mechanisms by proving a 
primary caregiving and custodial relationship with a child.  
  
 
 
C. Sufficient Effort to Establish a Sufficient Existing 
Relationship  
[¶ 38] This case involves an attempt by a grandparent to 
establish standing pursuant to 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(C) , 
which allows a grandparent to petition for visitation *477  
when the grandparent does not have a “sufficient existing 
relationship” with the child but has made “a sufficient 
effort to establish one.” It is important to note that the 
predicate for standing pursuant to subsection A was also 
met h ere because the child’s father had passed away.  
  
[¶ 39] As to subsection C, the Court acknowledges that 
“there was little else Dorr could have done to demonstrate 
a sufficient effort to establish a relationship” with the child. Court’s Opinion ¶ 22. The C ourt notes that Dorr 
unsuccessfully attempted to maintain contact with the 
child and unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the issue of 
contact with the mother. Id. ¶ 4. As in Conlogue,  the 
Court acknowledges that although the grandparent has 
established one of the factual predicates for standing that 
the Act identifies, that predicate is not sufficient. Id. ¶¶ 
22–24. In this case, as in Conlogue,  the Court couches its 
decision in consti tutional language without holding the 
statute unconstitutional.  
  
[¶ 40] I cannot join in this treatment of the statute. 
Because the grandmother here met the factual predicates 
for standing pursuant to both subsections A and C, her 
petition should not have  been dismissed for lack of 
standing.  
  
 
 
D. Conclusion  
[¶ 41] The Maine Grandparents Visitation Act, like many 
other grandparent visitation acts across the country, has 
underg one close scrutiny following the United States 
Supreme Court’s decision in Troxel. See  Kristine L. 
Roberts, State Supreme Court Applications of Troxel v. 
Granville and the Courts’ Reluctance to Declare 
Grandparent Visitation Statutes Unconstitutional,  41 
Fam. Ct. Rev. 14, 15 (2003). Some state appellate courts 
have upheld the constitutionality of grandparent visitation 
statutes by requiring trial courts to give “deference” to 
parents or to deny the presumption that grandparents have 
the right to access thei r grandchildren. See id.  at 26. 
Others have returned their grandparent visitation statutes 
to the legislative branches for revisions that conform more 
explicitly to the constitutional mandates set forth in 
Troxel. See, e.g., DeRose v. DeRose,  249 Mich.App. 388, 
643 N.W.2 d 259, 263 (2002)  (declining to “go from the 
judicial robing room to the legislative cloakroom” to read 
into the Michigan grandparent visitation statute 
“requirements that go beyond the text of the statute,” and 
concluding that “the rewriting of the ...  statute is a task 
best left for the Legislature.”).  
  
[¶ 42] In Rideout,  this Court recognized that the Act was 
passed “to provide a forum where certain grandparents 
could seek access to their grandchildren.” 2000 ME 198, ¶ 
16, 761 A.2d 291 . This Court’s decisions have left the 
structure of the Act ostensibly intact, while rendering that 
forum inaccessible to the grandparents that the Act 
identifies. Under the guise of a presumption in favor of 
constitutionality, the Court has grafted requirements onto 
Dorr v. Woodard, 140 A.3d 467 (2016)

 the language of the Act that were not intended by the 
Legislature, thereby obliterating the  Act’s remedies.  
  
[¶ 43] The Court should either hold that the Maine 
Grandparents Visitation Act is constitutional and 
recognize that petitioning grandparents prove standing by 
meeting the factual predicates established by the 
Legislature, or it should ho ld the Act unconstitutional and encourage the Legislature to revisit the Act.
