Decided: June 12, 2018  
Synopsis  
Background:  Maternal grandmother sought visitation 
with grandchild, and mother filed a motion to dismiss 
based on lack of standing. The Portland District Court, J. 
French , J., found grandmot her lacked standing to pursue a 
claim for visitation rights. Grandmother appealed.  
Holdings:  The Supreme Judicial Court, Hjelm , J., held 
that: 
  
the trial court’s error, if any, in acting upon mother’s 
motion to dismiss based on lack of standing before the 
21-days allowed by rule for grandmother to reply had 
expired was harmless;  
  
grandmother failed to establish standing to pursue a claim 
for visitation with grandchild under the Grandparents 
Visitation Act (GVA); and  
  
grandmother failed to establish de facto parenthood and 
have standing to seek vis itation with grandchild.  
Affirmed.  
  
Jabar , J., filed a dissenting opinion.

Opinion

*1278  [¶ 1] Deborah E. Lamkin appeals from a judgment 
entered by the District Court (Portland, J. French, J.  ) 
concluding that she did not have standing to pursue a 
claim for visitation rights with her grandchild pursuant to 
the Grandparents Visitation Act (GVA), 19–A M.R.S. §§ 
1801 –1805 (2017) , and, on that basis, dismissing her 
petition. On app eal, Deborah contends that the court erred 
in its standing determination. Because Deborah failed to 
demonstrate standing to proceed either pursuant to the 
GVA or as a putative de facto parent —a claim that is 
suggested in some of Deborah’s filings and that she 
presses on appeal —we affirm the judgment.  
I. BACKGROUND  
[¶ 2] The following facts are drawn from the procedural 
record and the court’s findings, which are supported by 
the record. See Philbrook v. Theriault , 2008 ME 152, ¶ 2, 
957 A.2d 74 . 
  
[¶ 3] Deborah E. Lamkin is the mother of Corrie L. 
Lamkin and the grandmother of the child at issue here. 
Corrie gave birth to the child in 2008. For the two years 
following the child’s birth, Corrie and her child lived with 
Deborah and Deborah’s husband until Corrie and the 
child moved into their own home. After Corrie and the 
child moved , Deborah had contact with the child “several 
days per week,” including “almost every weekend.” After 
the child entered daycare, Deborah cared for him two 
days per week. Once the child started school, on 
Wednesdays, Deborah met him when he got off the bus,  
and he stayed for dinner at her house. That pattern 
continued until December of 2016, when Corrie became 
involved in a relationship with her current boyfriend, who 
causes Deborah concern because he is a registered sex 
offender.  
  
[¶ 4] On June 2, 2017, De borah filed a petition, 
accompanied by an affidavit, see 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(2)(A) , to “establish grandparent’s rights” pursuant 
to the GVA, seeking “specific rights of v isitation, contact, 
etc., and/or ... primary physical residence” of the child.1 In 
addition to reciting many of the facts noted above, which 
were later addressed in the judgment, Deborah stated in 
her affidavit that in February of 2017, Corrie left the child 
with her for five days while Corrie visited Florida, an d

 later that month, both Corrie and the child stayed at 
Deborah’s residence for three weeks after Deborah’s 
husband died. Deborah also alleged that since March of 
2017, Corrie has prevented her from having contact with 
the child. She concluded her affidavi t as follows:  
I feel that [the boyfriend] is not a good influence on my 
daughter, and may present a safety hazard for [the 
child]. I feel it is in [the child’s] best interest to have 
specific rights of contact and visitation with me, at 
specific times and dates, and/or for [the child’s] 
primary physical residence to be with me.  
 1 
 Deborah’s petition named Corrie and the person 
believed to be the child’s father as the respondents. In 
the affidavit filed with her petition, Deborah stated that 
the putative father did not believe that the child was his 
and has h ad little or no contact with Corrie or the child. 
The record does not indicate that the putative father 
was served, and he has not participated in this 
proceeding. Title 19 –A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(A) (2017)  
requires that a GVA petition and accompanying 
affidavits need only be served on one of the parents or 
legal guardians of the child. Here, Corrie accepted 
service of the petition, which allowed the matter to 
proceed.  
 
[¶ 5] In response, Corrie filed a motion to dismiss for lack 
of standing. As allowed by statute, see 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(2)(B) , *1279  Corrie also filed an affidavit in which 
she stated, among other things, that since the child was 
three months old, he has been consistently enrolled in 
daycare or afterschool care and that Deborah has never 
provided or offered to provide full -time ca re for the child; 
that the boyfriend’s conviction was based on electronic 
sexual communications with a teenage girl; that Corrie 
has attended some of her boyfriend’s therapy sessions so 
she could learn of anything needed for the child’s safety; 
that the bo yfriend’s probation officer has approved of the 
boyfriend’s contact with the child; that, at Corrie’s 
request, the probation officer notified the Department of 
Health and Human Services of Corrie’s relationship with 
the boyfriend “to make sure we had prope r approval from 
every possible angle and that we were above board,” and 
that the Department chose not to investigate or become 
involved in the matter; that, at an activity the child 
regularly attends, Deborah has had contact with him 
against Corrie’s wishe s; and that Deborah is attempting to 
control Corrie’s parenting of the child, which Deborah 
has done throughout the child’s life.  
  
[¶ 6] Two days after Corrie filed her motion to dismiss 
Deborah’s petition, the court granted the motion. The 
court’s order set out the factual findings described above.2 
The court th en analyzed the information in the parties’ 
affidavits in terms of the legal standards governing de facto parenthood cases, see 19–A M.R.S. § 1891(2), (3) 
(2017) , and fou nd that Deborah had not provided 
“consistent caretaking” of the child; that Corrie had not 
“understood, acknowledged or accepted that or behaved 
as though [Deborah] is a parent of the child”; and that 
Deborah had not “accepted full and permanent 
responsibi lities as a parent of [the child],” id. § 
1891(3)(B) -(D). On that basis, the court concluded that 
Deborah had not established standing because she failed 
to make a “ prima facie showing of de facto parentage as 
required ... under the Grandparents Visitation Act” to 
proceed on her petition. (Italics omitted.)  
 2 
 With respect to the boyfriend, the court found that 
Corrie has addressed any concerns by —among other 
things —maintaining continuous contact with the 
boyfriend’s probati on officer and therapist, and by 
complying with restrictions they imposed.  
 
[¶ 7] Deborah filed a “Motion to Reconsider/or for 
Hearing” in which she asserted that her relationship with 
the child rises to the  level of a de facto parent and is 
“substantially greater than that of a normal and involved 
grandparent.”3 Deborah also filed another affidavit, in 
which she requested that the court hold an evidentiary 
hearing where she would present the testimony of 
third -party witnesses “ who would verify [her] role as a de 
facto *1280  parent to [the child].”4 In the affidavit, 
Deborah stated, among other things, that she had 
encouraged Corrie to enroll the child in daycare so that 
Corrie would be financially responsible for the child and 
the child would have  interaction with others of his age; 
that Corrie “broke off communication” between Deborah 
and the child, but Deborah continued to see the child at 
activities where Corrie was also present and therefore 
knew that Deborah was present; that Corrie provided 
Deborah’s contact information to third parties to be used 
in an emergency; and that Corrie has consulted Deborah 
on parenting issues.  
 3 
 As another ground stated in the motion and argued on 
appeal, Deborah contends that she was not given the 
twenty -one days allowed by rule to respond to Corrie’s 
motion to dismiss . See M.R. Civ. P. 7(c)(2) . Even if the 
court acted on Corrie’ s motion prematurely, that error 
is of no moment because the court issued another order 
after fully considering the additional argument and 
factual assertions that Deborah submitted in her motion 
for reconsideration. If anything, that process gave 
Deborah a particular advantage because, in the end, she 
was able to respond with knowledge of the deficiencies 
in her standing presentation that the court described in 
its initial order. See M.R. Civ. P. 61  (harmless error 
standard).  
In fact, the court acted with commendable expediency 
in acting on Corrie’s motion to dismiss. Because of the 
disruptive effect of a third -party proceeding on a 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76

 parent -child relationship, see, e.g. , Rideout v. Riendeau , 
2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 29 –32, 761 A.2d 291 , speedy 
resolution is of importance to the parties and, even 
more so, to the child who may be affected by the case. 
Here, the cou rt acted with dispatch but in a way that 
allowed Deborah to be fully and fairly heard.  
4 
 Elsewhere in the motion, and contrary to one form of 
relief she requested in her petition, Deborah stated that 
she was not seeking primary physical residence of the 
child but rather specific rights of contact.  
 
[¶ 8] The court denied Deborah’s motion, concluding that, 
even with the additional submissions, see supra  n.3, she 
had not demonstrated standing and that a hearing wa s 
unnecessary because the body of facts set forth in her 
various affidavits “fail to establish the elements of de 
facto parenthood required under Maine law.” Deborah 
timely appealed to us. See 14 M.R.S. § 1901(1) (2017) ; 
19–A M.R.S. § 104 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3)  (Tower 
2016).5 
 5 
 The restyled Maine Rules of Appellate Procedure do 
not apply because this appeal was filed before 
September 1, 2017. See M.R. App. P. 1  (restyled 
Rules).  
II. DISCUSSION  
[¶ 9] Deborah argues on appeal that the court erred by 
dismissing her petition based on its determination that she 
failed to establish standi ng. Deborah’s petition stated that 
it was predicated on the GVA, but, as we have noted 
above, see supra  ¶¶4, 7, her submissions to the court also 
introduced concepts that are specific to the law of de facto 
parenthood.6 The court made its standing determination 
pursuant to the de facto parentage framework prescri bed 
in the Maine Parentage Act (MPA), see 19–A M.R.S. § 
1891(3) . We conclude that, as a matter of law, when the 
substance of Deborah’ s petition is viewed solely as one to 
establish rights pursuant to the GVA itself, the evidence 
in the record is insufficient to demonstrate that Deborah 
has standing. Further, to the extent that Deborah’s claim 
is viewed as one to establish de facto paren thood, she has 
not demonstrated standing not only because —as the court 
concluded —the information in the record did not satisfy 
all of the statutory standing elements, but also because her 
failure to demonstrate standing pursuant to the GVA 
necessarily mean s that she cannot meet the greater 
standing requirements governing de facto parenthood 
cases.  
 6 
 These include the assertion in the originating petition 
that she was seeking primary physical residence of the 
child —something that goes well beyond “reasonable 
rights of visitation or access” that are available in a GVA proceeding, see 19–A M.R.S. § 1803  
(2017) —and explicit statements of de facto parenthood 
in later submissions.  
 
[¶ 10] We examine the legal aspects of a court’s standing 
determination de novo and review for clear error the 
factual findings underlying that determination. See 19–A 
M.R.S. §§ 1803(2) , 1891(2) ; Philbrook , 2008 ME 152, ¶ 
21, 957 A.2d 74  (citing Bissias v. Koulovatos , 2000 ME 
189, ¶ 6, 761 A.2d 47  (stating that the issue of standing 
presents a mixed question of law and fact, where the 
“underlying historical facts” on which a court “based its 
finding of standing are reviewed for clear error” and legal 
questions are reviewed de novo) ); see also  Desmond v. 
Desmond , 2011 ME 57, ¶ 5, 17 A.3d 1234  (stating that 
where “there was no request for findings *1281  following 
the court’ s entry of its judgment, we infer any findings 
necessary to support the result ... as long as those findings 
are supported by the record” (citing M.R. Civ. P. 52 ) ). 
A. Standing Principles in GVA and De Facto Parenthood 
Cases  
[¶ 11] In its judgment, the court equated the standing 
requirements in a GVA proceeding with those applicable 
to a de facto paren thood case. As we explain below, 
however, there can be a material difference between the 
two. Accordingly, before addressing how those standards 
apply to Deborah’s petition, we consider the relationship 
between the statutory principles of standing in GVA a nd 
de facto parenthood proceedings.  
  
[¶ 12] A third party’s action to establish rights regarding 
someone else’s child interferes with the parent’s 
fundamental right to raise that child and decide with 
whom, and under what circumstances, the child may have 
contact. See Rideout v. Riendeau , 2000 ME 198, ¶ 30, 761 
A.2d 291 ; see also  Troxel v. Granville , 530 U.S. 57, 65, 
120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000)  (stating that “ the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their 
children —is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty 
interests”); Curtis v. Medeiros , 2016 ME 180, ¶ 13, 152 
A.3d 605 ; Eaton v. Paradis , 2014 ME 61, ¶ 8, 91 A.3d 
590. Consequently, whether a grandparent seeks to 
establish rights of contact with a grandchild pursuant to 
the G VA, or a third party —who could  be a grandparent, 
see, e.g. , Philbrook , 2008 ME 152, ¶ 7, 957 A.2d 
74—seeks an adjudication of de facto parenthood, that 
petitioner must prove that he or she has standing to 
proceed to a plenary hearing on the requested relief. This 
common requirement is well -established both in our 
decisional authority7 and in statute,8 and constitutes a 
safeguard designed to prevent unjustified interference 
with the fundamental rights inherent in a parent -child 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76

 relationship, while also allowing an adjud ication of any 
legitimate interests of third parties that would affect that 
relationship. See Eaton , 2014 ME 61, ¶ 8, 91 A.3d 590  
(discussing the purpose of the standing requirement in de 
facto parenthood cases); Rideout , 2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 
30–32, 761 A.2d 291  (discussing the purpose of the 
standing requi rement in GVA cases). We review in turn 
the elements of standing necessary to proceed to a plenary 
hearing in de facto parenthood and GVA cases.  
 7 
 Compare  Dorr v. Woodard , 2016 ME 79, ¶ 14, 140 
A.3d 467  (stating that pursuant to statute in a GVA 
case, standing must be satisfied “before litigation may 
commence”), and Robichaud v. Pariseau , 2003 ME 54, 
¶ 8, 820 A.2d 1212  (characterizing the GVA standing 
requirement as “the first safeguard” against unduly 
burdening parents’ fundamental rights), with Philbrook 
v. Theriault , 2008 ME 152, ¶ 19, 957 A.2d  74 (stating 
that on a petition for de facto parenthood, the petitioner 
must satisfy the standing requirement “before a parent 
can be required to fully litigate the issue”), and Davis v. 
Anderson , 2008 ME 125, ¶ 17, 953 A.2d 1166  (same).  
8 
 Compare  19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1), (2) (GVA) , with 
19–A M.R.S. § 1891(2) (2017)  (de facto parentage).  
 
[¶ 13] To establish standing to proceed in a de facto 
parenthood case, the petitioner must prove, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, see Davis v. McGuire , 
2018 ME 72, ¶¶ 19, 26, 186 A.3d 837 , the same elements 
that the petitioner ultimately would be required to prove 
by clear and convincing evidence at a plena ry hearing for 
a determination of de facto parenthood status, see 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1891(2)(C), (3) . Those elements comprise the 
following:  
*1282  A. The person has resided with the child for a 
significant period of time;  
B. The person has engaged in consistent caretaking of 
the child;  
C. A bonded and dependent relationship has been 
established between the child and the person, the 
relati onship was fostered or supported by another 
parent of the child and the person and the other parent 
have understood, acknowledged or accepted that or 
behaved as though the person is a parent of the child;  
D. The person has accepted full and permanent 
respo nsibilities as a parent of the child without 
expectation of financial compensation; and  
E. The continuing relationship between the person and 
the child is in the best interest of the child.  
Id. § 1891(3) . These are the features that, when viewed 
collectively, the Legislature has determined to constitute the essence of a de facto parent -child 
relationship —namely, that the putative de facto parent 
“has fully and completely u ndertaken a permanent, 
unequivocal, committed and responsible parental role in 
the child’s life.”9 Id. 
 9 
 In a recent opinion, we noted the differences between 
the elements of de facto parentage articulated in 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1891 (2017)  and in our case law that predated 
the enactment of that statute. See Davis v. McGuire , 
2018 ME 72, ¶ 15 n.7, 186 A.3d 837 . In this case, as 
was true in Davis , we need not determine whether those 
statutory elements are a constitu tionally sufficient basis 
for the state to interfere with the parental rights of 
Corrie —a fit parent —because Deborah has not satisfied 
even the statutory elements of standing to pursue a de 
facto parenthood claim.  
 
[¶ 14] In contrast to the standing requirement in a de facto 
parenthood case, a grandparent who brings a claim 
pursuant to the GVA must demonstrate standing by 
showing either a “sufficient existing relationship” with 
the grandchild, or a “sufficien t effort to establish” a 
sufficient existing relationship with the grandchild. 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1803(1)(B), (C) .10 The first of these two 
formulations, set out in section 1803(1)(B) , is at issue 
here. We have held that the “substantial relationship” 
criterion set out in section 1803(1)(B)  can be applied 
constitutionally only when “the most urgent reasons ” are 
present as the compelling state interest that is 
constitutionally required to justify governmental 
interference with the “natural right of a parent to the care 
and control of a child. ” Rideout , 2000 ME 198, ¶ 24, 761 
A.2d 291  (quotation marks omitted); see also  Robichaud 
v. Pariseau , 2003 ME 54, ¶ 8, 820 A.2d 1212 . 
 10 
 Although not applicable in this case, section 1803(1)  
continues to state that a grandparent also may acquire 
visitation rights with a grandchild in a third situation, 
namely, when at least one of the child’s parents or legal 
guardians has died. 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(A) . We 
have held, however, that the death of one parent is not a 
sufficiently compelling basis for a court to interfere 
with the surviving parent’s rights to the child. Conlogue 
v. Conlogue , 2006 ME 12, ¶¶ 18, 22, 890 A.2d 691 . 
We also note that if a grandparent meets the standing 
prerequisite pursuant to the GVA, then at the resulting 
plenary hearing a court will be called upon to determine 
if the grandparent’s “reasonable rights of visitation or 
access” to the child is in the child’s best interest and 
whether any visitation or access would not 
“significantly interfere with any parent -child 
relationship or with the parent’s rightful  authority over 
the child.” 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(3) . This means that, 
unlike in a de facto parenthood case, there is a lack of 
symmetry between the elements of standing to proceed 
with a GVA petition and the elements of proof at a 
plenary hearing. Compare  19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1), (3) , 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  5 
 with id. § 1891(2), (3).  
 
[¶ 15] In a GVA case, the “ urgent reason” that must be 
present to establish standing includes  a situation where “a 
grandparent who has functioned as a parent to the child 
seeks continued contact *1283  with that child” —in other 
words, “[w]hen a  grandparent has been the primary 
caregiver and custodian for a child over a significant 
period of time.” Rideout , 2000 ME 198, ¶¶ 25, 27, 761 
A.2d 291  (quotation marks omitted); see also  Conlogue v. 
Conlogue , 2006 ME 12, ¶ 10, 890 A.2d 691 ; Robichaud , 
2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212  (stating that “ Rideout ’s 
‘urgent reasons’ standard presupposes extraordinary 
contact between a grandparent and grandchildren to 
satisfy the constitutional requirement of a compelling 
state interest to interfere with parents’ right to care for and 
control their children”). Conversely, where a 
grandparent’s contact with the grandchild is not 
extraordinary but rather is “intermittent,” t he grandparent 
does not have standing to proceed with a GVA petition. 
Robichaud , 2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 ; see also  
19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1) . 
  
[¶ 16] We have not, however, restricted the “urgent 
reasons” necessary to satisfy standing in a GVA case to 
the circumstance described in Rideout , where the 
petitioning grandparent had what amounted to a de facto 
parent relationship with the grandchild. Rideout , 2000 ME 
198, ¶¶ 4 –5, 24 –26, 761 A.2d 291 . Rather, such a 
relationship is “ [o]ne  such urgent reason” that warranted 
protection for the grandchildren’s benefit. Conlogue , 2006 
ME 12, ¶ 10, 890 A.2d 691  (emphasis added); see also  
Dorr v. Woodard , 2016 ME 79, ¶ 17, 140 A.3d 467  (“To 
date, the only ‘urgent reason’  that we have articulated for 
the intrusion upon a fit parent’s rights and grant of 
court -ordered visitation is the child’s need for continued 
contact with a grandparent who has been a primary 
caregiver and custodian for a significant part of the 
child’s l ife.”); Davis v. Anderson , 2008 ME 125, ¶ 15, 
953 A.2d 1166  (stating that “urgent reasons exist when 
grandparents have acted as de facto parents. No other 
urgent reasons have  yet been identified.” (citation 
omitted) ).  
  
[¶ 17] Therefore, in an action brought under the GVA, 
when a grandparent attempts to establish standing to 
pursue  a claim for rights of visitation with or access to the 
child through evidence of a de facto parent relationship, 
then—contrary to the court’s reasoning here —that 
standing will rest not on the proof that would be required 
in a de facto parenthood case itse lf, but rather on proof of 
standing as prescribed in the GVA, namely, the existence 
of a “sufficient existing relationship” that rises to the level 
of an “urgent reason” as we have explained that principle.11 If, however, a petitioner who happens *1284  
to be a grandparent seeks to be adjudicated as a de facto 
parent, then the petitioner will be required to prove 
standing pursuant to de facto parenthood principles.  
 11 
 Whatever may be the “urgent reason” that is essential 
to satisfy standing, it is determined by looking to the 
child’s needs, not those of a peti tioner. See Dorr , 2016 
ME 79, ¶ 17, 140 A.3d 467 ; see also  Rideout , 2000 ME 
198, ¶  26, 761 A.2d 291  (“The cessation of contact with 
a grandparent whom the child views  as a parent may 
have a dramatic, and even traumatic, effect upon the 
child’s well -being.” (emphasis added) ). We have made 
clear, however, that while the focus of the a nalysis is on 
the child, the child’s best interest —by itself —is not a 
sufficiently urgent reason that constitutionally satisfies 
the GVA standing requirement. See Dorr , 2016 ME  79, 
¶ 17, 140 A.3d 467 ; Davis , 2008 ME 125, ¶ 13, 953 
A.2d 1166 ; Conlogue , 2006 ME 12, ¶ 1 7, 890 A.2d 
691; Rideout , 2000 ME 198, ¶ 12, 761 A.2d 291 . 
Further, although we have left open the prospect that a 
grandparent may establish standing to pursue visitati on 
rights pursuant to the GVA with proof of some “urgent 
reason” other than de facto parenthood, our discussions 
make clear that any such opening is narrow. See, e.g. , 
Dorr , 201 6 ME 79, ¶¶ 16 –17, 140 A.3d 467 . We have 
cautioned that  
it will be difficult for a grandparent to demonstrate a 
compelling state interest sufficient to infringe on a fit 
parent’s fundamental right when there is no threat of 
harm to the child.  
.... 
Ultimately, the relationship that a grandparent has 
with his or her grandchild is a decision to be made by 
a fit parent, not the courts, unless the record presents 
a compelling reason for the State to intervene.  
Id. ¶¶ 16, 28 . 
[¶ 18] While the differences between the standing 
requirements in GVA and de facto parenthood 
proceedings are now a function of statute, we previously 
described the reason why those differences exist. I n a 
GVA proceeding, a court may award the limited rights of 
visitation or access, but only to the extent that the award 
does not “significantly interfere with any parent -child 
relationship or with the parent’s rightful authority over the 
child.” 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(3) . This contrasts with de 
facto parenthood  proceedings, as well as child protection 
and guardianship cases, where there is the prospect of a 
much more profound disruption of a parent’s relationship 
with his or her child because the full panoply of parental 
rights and responsibilities can be awarde d to third 
persons, thereby requiring a stronger justification to allow 
the case to progress to a plenary hearing. See Pitts v. 
Moore , 2014 ME 59, ¶ 16, 90 A.3d 1169  (quotin g 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1803(3)  ). Therefore, not only do the elemental 
standing requirements differ in the two types of 
proceedings, but the overall principle and nature of 
standing in a de facto parenthood case must be seen

 conceptually as more substantial than in GVA cases in 
order to justify the deeper level of governmental intrusion 
into a parent’s constitutionally protected interests.  
  
[¶ 19] Against this legal backdrop, we  now consider the 
sufficiency of evidence of Deborah’s standing to pursue 
rights pursuant to the GVA and as a de facto parent.  
B. Sufficiency of Evidence of Deborah’s Standing  
[¶ 20] As we have noted, Deborah commenced this action 
pursuant to the GVA but also raised the specter of de 
facto parenthood, and the court’s analysis centered on the 
standing requirements imposed in a de facto parenthood 
case. Therefore, we review Debora h’s petition both as a 
claim pursuant to the GVA and one seeking de facto 
parenthood. We first conclude that Deborah has not 
established, as a matter of law, that she has standing to 
pursue a GVA claim. And beyond that, she has failed to 
demonstrate standi ng for a de facto parenthood claim both 
because, as the court correctly concluded, the record does 
not satisfy all of the statutory elements, and also because 
her failure to meet the lower threshold of GVA standing 
necessarily means that she cannot meet th e greater 
standard imposed in de facto parenthood claims. We 
address Deborah’s claim of standing in both contexts.  
  
[¶ 21] Preliminarily, we note that in its order, the court 
examined Deborah’s factual asser tions that were most 
supportive of her claim. With one exception relating to 
Corrie’s boyfriend, discussed infra  ¶24, the court did so 
by accepting those assertions as true, which is an 
evidentiary standard that was more generous than that to 
which Deborah  was actually entitled. The GVA 
specifically provides that the court shall make its standing 
determination based on facts found  by the court. See 19–A 
M.R.S. § 1803(2)(C)  (“The court shall determine on the 
basis of the petition and the affidavit whether it is more 
likely than not  that there is a sufficient existing 
relationship or, if a sufficient relationship does not exist, 
that a sufficient effort to *1285  establish one has been 
made.” (emphasis added) ). Similarly, as we stated in an 
opinion published after the court issued its judgment, 
when attempting to demonstrate standing in a de facto 
parenthood case, the petitioner is subje ct to a burden of 
persuasion and not merely one of production. See Davis , 
2018 ME 72, ¶¶ 19, 25 –26, 186 A.3d 837 . Even when the 
record is viewed as the court did, Deborah has not 
demonstrated standing to become entitled to a plenary 
hearing for GVA rights or de facto parenthood, which we 
address in turn.  
1. GVA Standing  
[¶ 22] In her submi ssions, Deborah stated that Corrie and the child lived at Deborah’s residence until the child 
turned two years old, which was at the end of 2010. 
Corrie and the child then moved into a separate residence. 
From that time until Corrie chose to limit Deborah’ s 
contact with the child starting approximately in March of 
2017, Deborah’s contact with the child largely occurred 
one day per week after school and during most weekends, 
and by means of electronic communication, except for a 
unique circumstance in early 2017, shortly after 
Deborah’s husband died, when Corrie and the child 
stayed at Deborah’s residence for approximately three 
weeks. Notably, as Deborah acknowledged in her 
affidavits, she provided limited care for the child, and the 
child remained enrolled in daycare and, later, in 
afterschool care. In short, although Deborah’s contact 
with the child was on a somewhat predictable basis, that 
contact was nonetheless intermittent. As we have held, 
intermittent contact with a child is not an urgent reason 
that would allow a court to grant visitation rights to a 
grandparent. See Robichaud , 2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 
1212 . 
  
[¶ 23] In addition to the contact Deborah described, she 
asserted that Corrie had listed Deborah as the child’s 
emergency contact and that Corrie consulted with her 
about parenting issues. These extrinsic forms of 
Deborah’s involvement in the child’s life are typical of a 
grandparent’s support for a grandchild an d cannot be seen 
to rise to the level of urgency necessary to allow the court 
to consider intruding into Corrie’s constitutionally 
protected relationship with the child. See, e.g. , Katon v. 
Brandi M. , 2011 ME 131, ¶¶ 2 –3, 32 A.3d 1047  
(affirming the dismissal of a GVA petition for lack of 
standing on the basis that the contact averred was “typical 
for a grandparent and not extraordinary”).  
  
[¶ 24] As noted above, the one con tested aspect of the 
evidence where the court did make findings relates to 
Corrie’s boyfriend, who is a convicted sex offender. In 
her affidavit, Deborah expressed concern about the child’s 
safety in his presence. In a responsive affidavit, however, 
Corrie  provided detailed information about her interaction 
with the boyfriend’s probation officer and therapist to 
determine if the child was at risk, the probation officer’s 
approval of contact between the boyfriend and the child, 
and the probation officer’s co ntact with the Department of 
Health and Human Services at her request so that that 
agency is fully aware of the child’s circumstances. Based 
on the information provided in these competing affidavits, 
the court found that Corrie had addressed Deborah’s 
conc erns. The court was entitled to make findings of this 
type, and the finding is supported by the evidence. See 
Philbrook , 2008 ME 152, ¶ 21, 957 A.2d 74 . In one of her 
affidavits, Deborah expressly asserted that the presence of 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  7 
 the boyfriend in the child’s life was one of the two 
specific circumstances that, she claimed, entitled her to 
rights to the child even over the *1286  mother’s 
objection.12 Pursuant to the court’s f indings, her concern is 
not substantiated and cannot rise to the level of an urgent 
reason.  
 12 
 The second circumstance as alleged by Deborah was 
the interruption of her contact with the grandchild, 
which, as we discuss in the text, was not of a magnitude 
that would support creation of rights pursuant to the 
GVA.  See supra  ¶¶4, 22 –23. 
 
 
[¶ 25] For purposes of the GVA standing analysis, 
Deborah therefore has not demonstrated the existence of a 
substantial existing relationship that constitutes an “urgent 
reason,” as we have explained that concept, see, e.g. , 
Dorr , 2016 ME 79, ¶¶ 16 –17, 140 A.3d 467 , necessary to 
justify governmental intrusion in Corrie’s relationship 
with her child.  
2. De Facto Parenthood Standing  
[¶ 26] When Deborah’s petition is seen as seeking an 
adjudication of de facto parenthood, the court correctly 
concluded that her relationship  with the child fell 
materially short of the exacting standards necessary for a 
third person to be determined as a child’s parent. Our 
review of the record developed by the parties does not 
reveal triable contentions that Deborah engaged in 
consistent care taking of the child, that Corrie accepted or 
acknowledged Deborah as a co -parent of the child, or that 
Deborah accepted “full and permanent responsibilities” as 
the child’s parent. See 19–A M.R.S. § 1891(3)(B) -(D). 
These are requisite elements of a claim to become a 
judicially recognized de facto parent and are therefore 
also elements of standing necessary to pursue that claim. 
See id. § 1891(2)(C) . Because Deborah failed to present 
evidence of these elements —much less establish them by 
a preponderance of the evidence, see Davis , 2018 ME 72, 
¶¶ 19, 25 –26, 186 A.3d 837 —she has not demonstrated 
standing to proceed to a plenary hearing.  
  
[¶ 27] Further, by logical force, because Deborah has not 
satisfied the standing requirements for her GVA petition 
to obtain the less -intrusive visitation and access rights to 
the child over a fit parent’s objection, Deborah cannot 
satisfy the more rigorous standing requirement imposed 
by the MPA —namely, that she has “fully and completely 
undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed and 
responsible parental role in the child’s life” —to warrant 
intrusion in Corrie’s fundamental right to parent and raise 
her child. See 19–A M.R.S. § 1891(3) . III. CONCLUSION  
[¶ 28] Because Deborah did not establis h standing to 
proceed to a plenary hearing on her petition pursuant to 
the GVA or the more stringent statutory requirements of a 
de facto parenthood claim, we affirm the judgment 
dismissing her petition.  
  
The entry is:  
  
Judgment affirmed.  
  
 
 
JABAR , J., dissenting.  
 
[¶ 29] I respectfully dissent because the trial  court used 
the wrong legal standard to determine whether Deborah 
established standing under the Grandparents Visitation 
Act (GVA), 19–A M.R.S. §§ 1801 –1805 (2017) . The trial 
court’s decision hinged upon whether Deborah 
established standing as a de facto parent to the child. This 
is not the proper test to be applied by t he trial court in 
order to determine standing in a GVA case. Because it 
was the trial court that mistakenly introduced the issue of 
de facto parenthood, our review must focus on whether 
Deborah has established standing pursuant to the GVA 
and not pursuant to the principles of de facto parenthood.  
*1287  A. The Trial Court’s Application of the Wrong 
Standard  
[¶ 30] Although Deborah’s cause o f action was for 
contact pursuant to the GVA, the Court’s opinion 
repeatedly refers to Deborah’s attempts to establish 
standing by proving that she was a de facto parent. 
Court’s Opinion ¶¶ 1, 4, 7, 9, 20. For example, the Court 
refers to Deborah as “a put ative de facto parent” to the 
child, states that Deborah’s “submissions to the court ... 
introduced concepts that are specific to the law of de facto 
parenthood,” and asserts that even though “Deborah 
commenced this action pursuant to the GVA,” she “raised  
the specter of de facto parenthood.” Court’s Opinion ¶¶ 1, 
9, 20. The Court also references the language at the very 
end of Deborah’s petition —that she was seeking “primary 
physical residence” of the child —as support that she was 
seeking a de facto parent hood adjudication, and yet in 
footnote four, the Court acknowledges that Deborah was 
not seeking primary physical residence of the child. 
Court’s Opinion ¶¶ 4, 7 n.4.  
  
[¶ 31] The record, however, does not support these 
assertions by the Court. Because a t rial court’s decision 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  8 
 on standing is based on the pleadings without a hearing, 
see 19–A M.R.S. § 1803(2)(C) (2017) , we must look to 
the documents that were presented to the trial court prior 
to its decision. In Deborah’s petition for contact pursuant 
to the GVA and her accompanying affidavit, there is no 
reference whatsoever to the term de facto parentage or the 
Maine Parentage Act. See 19–A M.R.S. § 1891 (2017) . In 
response to Deborah’s GVA petition, Corrie filed a 
motion to dismiss with an accompanying affidavit. In this 
responsive pleading, which incorporated a memorandum 
of law, ther e is also no reference to the term de facto 
parentage. The memorandum of law cites and analogizes 
to our case Robichaud v. Pariseau , 2003 ME 54, 820 
A.2d 1212 , which is a GVA case that does not involve de 
facto parentage issues.  
  
[¶ 32] Without any further documents presented to the 
court by Deborah or Corrie, the trial court for the first 
time mistakenly referenced de facto parentage when it 
concluded that De borah had failed to make a prima facie 
showing that she was a de facto parent to the child and 
that she therefore lacked standing to proceed. In its order 
dismissing Deborah’s petition for visitation, the trial court 
concluded that  
Petitioner has not shown  de facto parent status, and 
thus cannot constitutionally pursue visitation rights 
under the Grandparents Visitation Act.  
Accordingly ... the court declines to find that she has 
made a prima facie  showing of de facto parentage as 
required for her to establish standing under the 
Grandparents Visitation Act.  
  
[¶ 33] In response to the court’s order, Deborah filed a 
motion for reconsideration and requested an alteration of 
the court’s decision, and i t was at that point, for the first 
time, that Deborah referred to de facto parentage and the 
legal precedents cited by the trial court in its order. It is 
obvious that she was trying to bring the facts of her case 
under the umbrella of de facto parentage a s a result of the 
trial court’s improper application of that standard. It is 
wholly inaccurate to imply, in any way, that Deborah’s 
case strategy was the reason the trial court incorrectly 
applied the de facto parentage standard to determine 
whether Debora h had standing to proceed. Of its own 
volition, the trial court steered this case onto a side track 
dealing with de facto parentage where it did not belong; it 
is a mistake for us to continue down that track.  
  
[¶ 34] Although Deborah’s post -judgment motio n filed in 
the trial court and her brief on appeal construe her 
arguments in *1288  terms of de facto parentage, that legal 
strategy is the logical outgrowth of the trial court’s 
erroneous application of the de facto parentage framework to Deborah’s initial GVA petition. I must 
reiterate that upon the GVA petition and the responsive 
pleading, neither Corrie nor Deborah ever mentioned de 
facto parentage, and it is entirely unnecessary for this 
Court, upon appellate revi ew, to consider Deborah’s 
arguments regarding de facto parentage —which she 
advanced only after the court improperly introduced this 
concept into the case —as the precursor to her GVA 
petition.  
  
[¶ 35] In the end, it should not make any difference who 
raise d the issue of de facto parentage —the trial court used 
the wrong legal standard when it failed to assess standing 
in this case pursuant to a GVA analysis. Because this is a 
GVA case, and not a de facto parenthood case, the 
statutory requirements for standi ng pursuant to the GVA 
should be the only issue that we consider in our review.  
B. The Proper Standard and its Application to this Case  
[¶ 36] In 1991, the Legislature first en acted the 
Grandparents Visitation Act.13 See P.L. 1991, ch . 414 
(effective Oct. 9, 1991) (codified at 19 M.R.S.A. §§ 
1001 –1005  (Supp. 1991) ). Our opinions construing the 
GVA have effectively made it impossible for 
grandparents to establish standing. See Dorr v. Woodard , 
2016 ME 79, ¶¶ 29 –43, 140 A.3d 467  (Jabar, J., 
dissenting) (discussing the demise of each possible 
avenue to establish standing pursuant to the GVA). 
Regardless, I believe that the GVA —which has ne ither 
been repealed by the Legislature nor held facially 
unconstitutional by this Court —and its statutory 
requirements should control our analysis.  
 13 
 In enacting the GVA, the Legislature demonstrated its 
belief that the maintenance of the relationship between 
the grandparent and the grandchild is in the best in terest 
of the child in certain cases, and that that relationship is 
something of value from the child’s perspective. See 
L.D. 1307, Statement of Fact (115th Legis. 1991) (“All 
children are enti tled to enjoy secure, stable and 
beneficial relationships with their grandparents and to 
maintain these relationships .... The bill allows the court 
to maintain the relationship between a grandchild and 
that grandchild’s grandparents when it is in the 
grandchild’s best interest and does not interfere with a 
parent -child relationship.”).  
 
 
[¶ 37] In Robichaud , the leading case cited by Corrie in 
her motion to dismiss, we inter preted the GVA, without 
reference to de facto parenthood, as requiring three 
safeguards against the intrusion into a parent’s 
fundamental rights:  
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  9 
 The safeguards include that: (1) a grandparent must 
establish standing before  litigation may commence on a 
petition, (2) the court must consider any objection of 
the parents concerning an award of rights of visitation 
or access by the grandparents (giving life to the 
presumption that parents act in the best interests of 
their children), and (3) the court may not g rant 
visitation if doing so would significantly interfere with 
any parent -child relationship or with the parent’s 
rightful authority over the child.  
2003 ME 54, ¶ 8 n.2, 820 A. 2d 1212  (quotation marks 
omitted). The first safeguard, and the only one relevant to 
this case at this stage, is that the grandparent must 
establish standing before litigation may commence. See 
id.; see also  19–A M.R.S. § 1803(1)(A) -(C). Pursuant to 
section 1803(1)(B) , a grandparent may peti tion the court 
for reasonable rights of visitation or access if “a sufficient 
existing relationship” exists “between the grandparent and 
the child.” In Robichaud , we held tha t in order to comply 
with the constitutional protections afforded parents, 
grandparents must *1289  establish that “urgent reasons” 
exist. 2003 ME 54, ¶¶ 7, 10, 820 A.2d 1212 . Implicit 
within the test set forth in Robichaud  was the concept that 
the “urgent reasons standard presupposes extraordinary 
contact between a grandparent and grandchildren to 
satisfy the constitutional requiremen t of a compelling 
state interest to interfere with parents’ right to care for and 
control their children.” Id. ¶ 10 (quotation marks omitted).  
  
[¶ 38] Although the test set  out in Robichaud  does not 
require any finding of de facto parenthood, some of our 
cases following Robichaud  have led to confusion 
regarding the intersection of the law governing de facto 
parentage and grandparent visitation.14 In some of those 
cases, we have held that the establishment of de facto 
parentage status meets the “extraordinary contact” test set 
forth in Robichaud , see, e.g. , Davis v. Anderson , 2008 ME 
125, ¶ 19, 953 A.2d 1166 ; Dorr , 2016 ME 79, ¶ 17, 140 
A.3d 467 , but just because the establishment of de facto 
parentage will satisfy the “extraordinary contact” test 
does not mean that the de facto p arentage test is the 
proper test to apply when evaluating a case brought 
pursuant to the GVA. In order to gain standing pursuant 
to a de facto parentage claim, the petitioner must meet a 
much higher bar than the petitioner must meet pursuant to 
the GVA.  
 14 
 Although the Court’s opinion gives a thorough 
explanatio n of de facto parenthood, it is unnecessary 
and, more importantly, it adds to the confusion that this 
line of cases has created. Other than holding that the 
trial court erred by using the standard for de facto 
parenthood in a GVA case, there is no need to discuss 
de facto parenthood.  
  
[¶ 39] In Dorr v. Woodard  and Davis v. Anderson , for 
example , we clearly indicated that there may be other 
cases that fall short of the stringent requirements of de 
facto parentage but nevertheless may still pass the “urgent 
reasons” or “extraordinary contact” test of Robichaud . In 
Dorr , we stated that “[t]o date, the only urgent reason that 
we have articulated” is the test for de facto parentage, but 
“[i]t is possible  that in some circumstances, a 
grandparent’s sufficient effort to establish a relationship 
with her grandchild could pass constitutional muster and 
demonstrate urgent reasons .... However, we are not 
called upon here to define all instances where a 
compelling interest could be demonstrated. ” 2016 ME 79, 
¶¶ 17, 24, 140 A.3d 467  (emphasis added) (quotation 
marks omitted). In Anderson , we stated that aside from de 
facto parentage, “[n]o other urgent reasons have yet been 
identified.” 2008 ME 125, ¶ 15, 953 A.2d 1166  (emphasis 
added).  
  
[¶ 40] Here, the pivotal issue is whether Deborah 
established “extraordinary contact” with her grandchild. 
See Robichaud , 2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 . Using 
the de facto p arentage test creates a much higher bar than 
necessary to establish standing in a GVA case. Because 
this is a GVA case not involving any claim for de facto 
parenthood, and the trial court used the wrong legal 
standard, we should remand for the trial court to consider 
the pleadings using the proper “extraordinary contact” 
standard articulated in Robichaud . 
  
[¶ 41] Although the Court acknowledges that the trial 
court used the wrong legal standard to determine 
Deborah’s standing, it does not remand the case to the 
trial court to determine standing using the proper 
standard. Court’s Opinion ¶ 9. Rather, the Court,  as a 
matter of law, concludes that Deborah has failed to 
establish standing under the GVA. Court’s Opinion ¶¶ 9, 
21. In this, I strongly disagree. If we are to review the 
affidavits and the facts presented in the affidavits, *1290  
then I believe that Deborah has established “extraordinary 
contact” with her grandchild such that she has standing to 
proceed on her petition.  
  
[¶ 42] At the outset, it is important to note that standing 
does not afford Deborah an entitlem ent to relief under the 
GVA —it only establishes that she has had a close enough 
relationship with the child such that she is entitled to be 
heard regarding whether it is in the child’s best interest 
that she have contact with the child. See 19–A M.R.S. § 
1803(2) -(3). Once standing has been established, the trial 
court addresses the best interest of the child. See id.  It is at 
that point in the proceeding that t he trial court would 
consider the second and third safeguards enunciated in 
Lamkin v. Lamkin, 186 A.3d 1276 (2018)   
2018 ME 76  
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  10 
 Robichaud : 
(2) the court must consider any objection of the parents 
concerning an award of rights of visitation or access by 
the grandparents (giving life to the presumption that 
parents act in the best interests of their children), and 
(3) the court may not grant visitation if doing so would 
significantly interfere with any parent -child 
relationship o r with the parent’s rightful authority over 
the child.  
2003 ME 54, ¶ 8 n.2, 820 A.2d 1212  (quotation marks 
omitted). After consideration of these safeguards and the 
best int erest standard, the trial court may conclude that the 
grandparents are not entitled to any contact or are entitled 
to only limited contact.15 As to the standing issue, the 
focus is only on the relationship between the grandparent 
and the child.  
 15 
 The Court discusses Corrie’s boyfriend in its opinion, 
see Court’s Opinion ¶ 24, but that discussion is 
misplace d at our stage of appellate review because 
although it may be relevant to what is in the child’s best 
interest, it is irrelevant to the issue of standing. The 
child’s best interest is not before us today.  
 
[¶ 43] In Robichaud , we indicated that the focus is on the 
existing or historical contact between the grandparent and 
the child to determine whether that contact is 
“extraordinary.” 2003 ME 54, ¶ 10, 820 A.2d 1212 . The 
grandmother in Robichaud  described her contact as 
occasional visits with the grandchildren, with visits 
sometimes lasting one day to one week over about a 
three -year period. Id. ¶ 6. The trial court there found that 
the contact described typified the type of contact that “one 
would anticipate from a connected, extended family.” Id. 
(quotation marks omitted). We agreed and concluded that 
this level of contact was “intermittent” and therefore did 
not show that the grandmother had had extraordinary 
contact with the grandchildren. Id. ¶ 10 . Similarly, in 
Dorr , we decided that the facts —the grandmother 
attended a baby shower for the child, went to the hospital 
the evening that the child was born, and had some 
unspecified amount of contact with the child —did not 
establish a sufficient existing relationship to confer 
standing. 2016 ME 79, ¶¶ 4, 20, 140 A.3d 467 . 
  
[¶ 44] This case is very different. The relationship 
between Deborah and the child was anything but ordinary 
or intermittent. Unlike the grandmother  in Robichaud , 
Deborah’s contact was extraordinary and not typical. The 
following facts, which are not contested, are contained in 
the grandmother’s affidavit: Corrie and the  child lived 
with her, full time, for the first two years of the child’s 
life. When Corrie moved out, she moved only a half -mile 
away, and Corrie and the child had contact with the grandparents several days a week. Deborah had the child 
with her at least o ne day per week and most weekends for 
the first several years of the child’s life. As soon as the 
child was old enough for daycare, Deborah had him two 
days per week while Corrie was at work, and Deborah 
*1291  saw hi m almost every weekend. When the child 
started school, she would meet him at the bus on 
Wednesdays and feed him dinner. Deborah spoke with the 
child on the phone and through other electronic media 
several days per week. This close relationship continued 
for eight years until December of 2016, when a conflict 
arose between Corrie and Deborah because of Corrie’s 
boyfriend. Later, after the child’s grandfather, Deborah’s 
husband, died, Corrie and the child moved in with 
Deborah for almost a month. This contact  between 
Deborah and her grandchild was regular, close, and 
intensive; it was far from “typical.” See Court’s Opinion ¶ 
23; Katon v. Brandi M. , 2011 ME 131, ¶¶ 2 –3, 32 A.3d 
1047 . In fact, it is the exact type of “secure, stable and 
beneficial” relationship that the Legislature intended to 
permit grandparents to preserve and maintain through its 
enactment of the GVA. See supra  n.13.  
  
[¶ 45] Although these facts would not entitle the 
grandmother to de facto parenthood status —a status she 
never requested —the grandmother’s relationship with the 
child far exceeds that which is typical of a “connected, 
extended family” and is exactly the kind  of “sufficient 
existing relationship” the Legislature intended should give 
rise to grandparent standing to seek visitation. If called 
upon to make a conclusion from the facts contained in the 
affidavit —which would be unnecessary were we to 
remand so that the court could apply the proper legal 
standard —we should conclude that Deborah has 
established standing to proceed on her petition. Therefore, 
she should be entitled to make her case in court that some 
level of contact between her and the grandchild is in  the 
child’s best interest.  
C. Conclusion  
[¶ 46] We should remand for the trial court to apply the 
proper “extraordinary contact” standard enunciated in 
Robichaud . Alternatively, we should conclude as a matter 
of law that Deborah has demonstrated that she has had 
extraordinary contact with the child and therefore has a 
sufficient existing relation ship to establish standing 
pursuant to section 1803 of the GVA such that she may 
proceed on the merits of her petition.
