Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on J udiciary;  
 
 
My name i s Daniel Denicola from Newport, Maine.  On April 17,  2017  my grandson Jayce was 
born. I had no knowledge when I went t o the hospital for the birth that my son Ryan and his 
girlfriend F aith had been abusing  prescription  Adde rall and were involved with DHHS .  
 
 
When they all came home from the hospital , I visited with my grandson for the first 6 months of 
his life.  Then I was informed through the g rapevine that my ex mother -in-law adopted my 
grandson and changed his name.  
 
 
My ex -mother -in-law still holds a grudge from her daughter Brandy and my divorce. So , as a 
consequence , she won â€™t let me see  my grandson.  I haven't seen my grandson in 5 years. I was 
never informed about the adoption hearing, and I was never given any visitation.  
 
 
In my opinion the Department of Health and Human Services was under the family's first 
platform at th e time my grandson was adopted.  However , the courts nor DHHS informed me of 
the hearing. DHHS wo rkers told my son not to tell his dad because his dad will come to court 
and fight for visitation.  
 
 
I desperately want t o see my only grandson.  Thank you.
