LD 66
Hello,
I am against LD66. Bottled water is not a grocery or food item. It is not necessary except for 
emergency situations. When it is used as a convenience purchase in plastic bottles, it does 
great harm to our already struggling environment and causes economic hardship on the 
population by requiring more landfill space to put the bottles, which have a lifespan of 
thousands of years. A very large amount of tax dollars are spent at all levels of government to
maintain clean groundwater. It is unfair and immoral for multinational corporations to derive 
the benefits from this environmental stewardship of the general population so they can make 
obscene profits while degrading the environment. Tap water in Maine is generally of high 
quality and regular testing is done to comply with State laws. This is not the case with bottled 
water, so there is also an inherent danger to those drinking bottled water.
Reducing the tax burden on these purchases encourages an activity that is detrimental to 
Maine citizens on many levels and only benefits large bottle water companies. This should 
not be a priority. If anything, taxes should be greatly increased to help offset the tax dollars 
already being used to keep the groundwater clean. I would encourage the members of this 
taxation committee to support the continuation of  The Commission to Study the Role of 
Water in Maine. It is obvious there are many very important issues about water.
