     I am a mother and grandmother as well as a health care professional with an M.S. in 
Occupational Therapy and a doctorate in Health Education (Ed.D).  Based on my knowledge 
of how to protect and promote human health, I agree that a clean and reliable supply of 
drinking water is essential to human health.  Bottled drinking water is not, however, a grocery 
staple and should not be categorized with such things as vegetables, fruits, bread and milk.
       Except for occasional emergencies, water in bottles is a PERSONAL CHOICE that may 
be convenient but is definitely not essential. Water in bottles is not and should not be 
considered a grocery 'staple'.  
     An ample supply of clean drinking water is the responsibility of homeowners who have 
private wells or towns and cities who are in charge of public water. 
    Reliance on bottled water as a'staple' can lead to cities and towns as well as private well 
owners ignoring the necessity of keeping their water supplies safe and available.  The 
beneficiaries of such practices will be the companies that sell bottled water.  The victims of 
such practices will be consumers forced to rely on bottled water as well as the environment, 
which must bear the brunt of a deluge of plastic bottles.
     A designation of 'grocery staple' for bottled drinking water, furthermore, will inevitably lead 
to a slippery slope of other non-necessities being designated 'staple', such as soda water, 
sugary 'fruit' drinks, colas and other soda drinks, and eventually chips, pretzels, cookies and 
other unhealthy consumables.  
     In my professional opinion, keeping bottled drinking water among the taxable foods and 
drinks is best for human health and for the environment. Please do not include bottled 
drinking water with real grocery staples.
