Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Committee of Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 1052, An Act to Expand Good Samaritan Protections for Naloxone Hydrochloride 
Administration  
Public Hearing: March 27, 2023, at 10:00 am in State House, R oom 436  
 
Dear Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salibury , and distinguished members  
of the Committee of Criminal Justice and Public Safety,  
 
My name is Tori Stierwalt, a second -year osteopathic medical student  studying at the University of  New 
England College of Osteopathic  Medicine . I volunteer in harm  reduction services in Cumberland and 
York County and intend to continue doing this work  when I relocate to Bangor soon. Prior to moving to 
Maine, I worked with substance use  disorders in the  Midwest, having administered Naloxone myself. I 
have the privileg e to provide  testimony in support of LD 1052 on behalf of the M aine Osteopathic 
Association .  
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a p rofessional organization representing approximate ly 
400 osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education , 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure  the availability of quality osteopathic health  care to the 
people of  this State.”  
 
The MOA has always been  support ive of Good Samar itan protections that encourage bystanders to act 
quickly to save lives.  
 
Based on the Maine Monthly Overdoses Report, ther e were 10,150 overdoses in 2022. 7% of  those were 
fatal, which equates  to the loss of  715 Maine  lives . Of those 715 reports, only 181 had Naloxone 
administered on  scene. That means  nearly three quarters of the time these fatal overdose incidents – 534 
total-- did not have th e benefi t of t his life-saving reversal drug provided on -scene.  
 
The statistics for this year are already staggering. As of January 2023,  there have been 744 overdoses, 50 
of which have been fatal. Only 10 of these  (20%) had  Naloxone adm inistration reported. Focusing in on 
the reported overdoses that were not fatal,  nearly 25% were report ed by community members. And we 
can only speculate about how m any other suspected overdoses and overdose reversals go un reported.  
 
In medicine, there is a saying “time is tissue”. I n critical settings that are time -sensitive  and life -
threating, like an overdose, this is  a reminder to respond quickly to preserve life. A witness  to an 
overdose must respond without hesitancy when arme d with Naloxone. Bystande rs should not  have to  
stop to consider the implications of ac ting to save a life or reporting over dose incidents, The expansion 
of Good Samaritan Protections promotes the use of an incredibly safe, life -saving medication in  times of 

 2 most need. Maine’s harm  reduction community works tirelessly to put Naloxone in  hands of those who 
need it. You can prot ect those who use it by passing LD 1052.
