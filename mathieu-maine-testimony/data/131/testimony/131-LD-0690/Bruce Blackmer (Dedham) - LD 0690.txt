LD 690 
To Chairpersons Anne Carney, Matt Moonen, and the members of the Judiciary Committee 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and 
Managers Association, GBAOMA. 
0 I am also a member of the Legislative Council representing landlords and property 
owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, 
Auburn, and the Bangor areas. 
0 I have been a landlord since 1972. I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , mult1' ~units, and 
single-family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. I have mostly provided 
affordable housing to low-income tenants. 
0 I oppose that a prospective tenant may bringing me paperwork from a screening service 
of their choice. I would only feel comfortable with tenants supplying their own 
background and credit checks if, the State puts a system in place to ensure that the 
information received is reputable. As there is no current system to guard against 
fraudulent information, I will need to double check the information handed to me. False 
papers can easily be produced on a personal computer. 
0 I do agree someone being charged fees, over and over again for screening is a problem. 
I hope the State can come up with solution that ceases excessive fees for the tenant and 
guarantees accurate information for the landlord. 
0 I am here to ask you to OPPOSE LD 690. 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I 
_ would be happy to answer any 
questions.
