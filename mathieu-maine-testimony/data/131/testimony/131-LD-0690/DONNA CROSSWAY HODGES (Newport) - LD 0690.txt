LD 690
Opposition to LD 690 AS IT IS WRITTEN   
support amended version!   As a rental property owner I would love to have 
applicants come prepared with a credit and criminal report!   I actually encourage 
every applicant to go to one of the big "3" each year and get a credit report!  
Would the State of Maine consider providing a free criminal background check to 
each person per year?   This could actually help speed up the process for rentals but 
also for employment.
