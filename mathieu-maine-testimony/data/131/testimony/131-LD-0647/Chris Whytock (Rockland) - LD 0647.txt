LD 647
I would like to provide testimony in support of LD 647.  This LD has developed out of a 
concern in my town in relation to sprinkler systems shutting down in a congested, downtown 
area for which I personally lost sleep over knowing the building was not fully protected.  This 
lead to numerous discussions with Rep Geiger and thus, the LD in front of you.  After 
speaking to the State Fire Marshal and exploring all avenues, the draft of LD 647 was brought
to you with thought and care.  Currently, there are options to shut down sprinkler systems 
through NFPA for temporary work being done, and the Office of the State Fire Marshal for 
"seasonal shut downs".  In order for this to occur the building owner must get approval from  
their insurance company, an "acknowledgement" from the local authority having jurisdiction, 
and the Office of the State Fire Marshal.  There is no consideration for any exposures or 
buildings close by, or any other fire protection/separation that currently exists.  Also, the 
"authority having jurisdiction" doesn't approve nor deny, but just acknowledges the shut down.
With fires in these areas happening with sprinkler systems being shut down, this could be 
devastating to almost any community, let alone the life safety issues that are inherent to our 
jobs.  
Please support the LD in its forma nd help us protect our cities and towns with proper laws 
and regulations.
Thank you!
