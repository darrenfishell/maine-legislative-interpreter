To WhOl11 it May Concern: 
Maine Preservation is a statewide non rofit or anization dedicated to romotin and P g P g 
preserving historic places, buildings, downtowns, and neighborhoods, strengthening 
the cultural and economic vitality of Maine communities. 
An Act to Amend the Law Governing the State Grant Program Administered by the 
Maine Historic Preservation Commission (HPI9/LD15) presented by Representative 
]anice Dodge of Belfast makes minor technical changes to the language of the statute 
regarding the state restoration grant program. Wl1il€ minor, these changes are needed 
to align the language of the grant program with current historic preservation 
terminology that has evolved in federal guidelines and in practice. The proposed 
legislation would also eliminate a clause in the grant requiring the State to havea 
right of first refusal as part of easements it acquires. This stipulation wasa 
requirement of federal preservation grant funding that is no longer required by the 
National Park Service 
For these reasons, Maine Preservation supports passage of HP 19/ LD15.
