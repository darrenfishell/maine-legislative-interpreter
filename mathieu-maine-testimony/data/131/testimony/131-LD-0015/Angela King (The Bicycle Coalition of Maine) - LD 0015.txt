Testimony in Support of LD 142
An Act T o Fund Climate-related Service W ork
Good afternoon Sen. Raferty , Rep. Brennan, and members of the Education and
Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Angela King, and this testimony is on
behalf of the Bicycle Coalition of Maine.
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide organization that advocates for
bicyclists and pedestrians. W e work to make Maine better for bicycling and walking
to encourage active transportation, which improves environmental and public
health.
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine supports LD 142 because community service
programs that address the climate crisis need to be funded. Maine needs more
actions for a sustainable environment. According to the state’ s Climate Council,
passenger cars and trucks are the largest source of carbon emissions in Maine.
Research has shown that more people would choose to commute or run errands
by walking or riding a bicycle—and not drive a car—if they felt safer on our
roadways. W e strongly recommend ef forts to reduce vehicle miles traveled,
including programs and policies that encourage more people to choose biking and
walking, be part of the Climate Corp’ s efforts.
Maine
needs to set a sustainable
path forward that limits carbon and other pollution, improves public and
environmental health, and fosters strong communities.
Funding for climate-related work has the potential to improve both environmental
and public health in Maine by working on issues that reduce carbon emissions and
increase active transportation.
For these reasons, we urge the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee to
support LD 142.
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely ,
Angela King, Advocacy Manager for the Bicycle Coalition of Maine
