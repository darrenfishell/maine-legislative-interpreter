Eliminating the State’s right of ﬁrst refusal is another example of how practices have changed in 
the past forty years. Early on, the federal program that provided matching grants to preserve 
historic properties required such a provision in the term covenants that were placed on those 
properties. When Maine established its state funded restoration grant program it adopted a 
similar provision. However, the National Park Service no longer requires a right-of-first refusal 
clause in any covenant that is executed as the result of a development grant supported by the 
Historic Preservation Fund, and the Commission believes that the State of Maine no longer needs 
to include such provisions in its historic preservation grants program. 
The proposed amendments reﬂect current historic preservation practices and Will provide 
consistency with federal funding requirements. The changes include: 
0 Replacing the term “stabilization ” with the term “preservation ” 
I Replacing the term “structure ” With the tenn “historic properties ” 
0 Removing the requirement to include a right of ﬁrst refusal for the State in any covenant 
placed on an historic property that is awarded a state ﬁnanced grant; and 
0 Replacing the reference to the Secretary of the Interior ’s Standards for Rehabilitation 
with the Secretary of the Interior ’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. 
The latter contains speciﬁc treatment sections for restoration and preservation, which is 
the original purpose of the grant program. 
In closing, I wish to thank both Rep. Dodge for sponsoring this bill on behalf of the Commission, 
and the Committee for its consideration of this matter.
