Testimony of Representative Holly Eaton in support of  
LD 588, An Act to Promote Public Safety and Retain Essential First Responders by 
Funding the Maine Length of Service Award Program  
Before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety  Committee  
 
Good morning, Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury  and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety  Committee . My name is Holly Eaton , and I represent House District 
15, which includes the communities of Brooklin, Deer Isle, Frenchboro, Marshall Island, 
Southwest Harbor, Stonington, Swan’s Island, Tremont, Eagle Island Township, Isle au Haut 
and Vinalhaven. I write to you today in support of LD 588, An Act to Promote P ublic Safety 
and Retain Essential First Responders by Funding the Maine Length of Service Award 
Program . 
 
In rural Maine, you won’t  find many paid fire departments.  The men and women who volunteer 
their time  and service to keep us safe deserve our support.  For the sake of rural communities like 
mine who depend on them, I urge this committee to support funding the Length of Service 
Award Program.  
 
Thank you for your attention. Please let me know if you have any questions that you would like 
me to answer at the work session.
