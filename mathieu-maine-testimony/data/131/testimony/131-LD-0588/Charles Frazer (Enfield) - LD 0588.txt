RE: LD 588 
An Act to Promote Public Safety and Retain Essential First Responders by Funding the Maine 
Length of Service Award Program  
Sen.  Chip  Curry  of Waldo  
 
 
Dear  Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:   
 
The Howland Maine Fire/EMS Dep artmen t is a municipal first responder service within 
central Penobscot County and is the contracted provider for essential lifesaving  protections  to the 
Town of Enfield , Maine .  Howland is  championing  a new endeavor designed to ultimately  
provide a more effective, affordable  and sustainable Fire/EMS model for not only its current 
partner and client base, but also for a larger area of rural Maine.   This visionary initiative  to 
collaborate on a regional level  is driven by many factors, not the least of which is limited access 
to wel l-trained first responders.  Many of the municipalities involved in the Howland model have 
previously sponsored independent Fire/EMS Departments, but each of these efforts have failed 
due to limited employee and/or volunteer resources.  
 
The Town of Enfield â€™s elected official s hereby express their support of legislature that is 
expected to increase  retention of first responders  in Maine .  We must work together to  solve the 
current fire/EMS crisis in Maine to create acceptable levels of service and reliable r esponses, 
particularly in rural Maine .   
 
 
 
Sincerely , 
 
Charles Frazier  
 
 
Charles Frazier  
Town Manager  
Enfield , Maine
