LD 151, “An Act Regarding Child Welfare” 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
May 17, 2023 
Senator Baldacc1, Representat1ve Meyer and D1st1ngu1shed Members of the J o1nt Stand1ng 
Comrmttee on Health and Human Servlces 
I am Senator Trey Stewart, and I represent D1str1ct 2, Wl11Ch mcludes several communltles 1n 
Aroostook County and Northern Penobscot County I am here today to present to you LD 151, 
“An Act Regardmg Chzld Welfare” 
I apprec1ate your g1v1ng th1s proposal the t1me and attent1on 1t deserves Understand1ng there are 
other measures you’ve heard th1s sess1on that may appear to be the same, my b1ll 1s d1st1nct 1n 
that I would l1ke to 1mplement a comprehens1ve long-term strateglc plan that 1s geared 
spec1ﬁcally towards the wellbe1ng of Ma1ne’s ch1ldren I know we all are comm1tted to the 
common goal of keep1ng ch1ldren safe a.nd ensur1ng the most practlcal and efﬁc1entdel1very of 
serv1ces w1th1n the Ofﬁce of Ch1ld and F am1ly Servlces (OCF S) 
Dr Todd Landry, D1rector of OCFS, subm1tted onl1ne test1mony 1n opp0s1t1on to th1s b1l1 He 
states, “We are unclear how th1s 1s substant1vely d1fferent from LD 1754, “Resolve, to Establzsh 
the Commzsszon to Study the Delzvery of Servzces to Chzldren and Famzlzes ” Well, LD 1754 
creates a comm1ss1on to study rssues related to establ1sh1ng a new state department focused 
solely on unprovmg serv1ces for ch1ldren and fam1l1es and must submrt a report back to you for 
our Second Regular Sesslon Conversely, the proposal 1n front of you has noth1ng to do w1th 
establ1sh1ng a new department Also 1n Dr Landry’s,test1mony, as I sa1d before, my b11l a1ms to 
develop a long-term strateg1c plan So11d 1mprovements 1n the del1very of OCFS serv1ces Wlll 
not happen overmght — or even over a few months But, we need a plan 
As we all know, OCFS has faced major scrut1ny over the last few years I can honestly say my 
ofﬁce rece1ves calls every week relay1ng concerns, quest1ons and cr1ses regard1ng the care and 
safety of ch1ldren — rlght down to no one answermg the phone at the Department Our 
Govermnent Overs1ght Cormmttee was tasked w1th 1nvest1gat1ng the ntunerous ch11d deaths and 
the role of OCFS 1n the l1ves of the ch1ldren and the1r fam1l1es My b1ll goes much further than 
that I would l1ke to see a ten-year plan that would hold the Ofﬁce accountable By that I mean 
cap1tal1ze on 1ts strengths and recogmze and bu1ld upon 1ts weaknesses

Amendlng th1s b1ll 1nto a resolve could do Just that One suggestlon would be to change the 
current t1tle to “Resolve, to Dzrect the Department of Health and Human Servzces to Develop a 
Long-Term Plan to Better Protect Chzldren zn State Care ” The obJect1ve of the Commlsslon 
would be to develop th1s ten-year strateg1c plan I would suggest to you that members of the 
Comm1ss1on would 1nclude representat1ves of law enforcement, the Jud1c1ary, mental health 
professlonals, healthcare pI‘OfCSS10113.lS, teachers, parents, and grandparents Our goal here 1s to 
br1ng the number of ch1ld deaths 1n state care to zero 
Ant1c1pat1ng the statement that we’ve already done th1s or we’ve had a study to look at our ch1ld 
welfare servlces, my questlon to you 1s, “Where 1s 1t‘? What were the goals‘? What new has been 
done to protect our ch1ldren'? ” 
In my ﬁrst term 1n the leg1slature, we all recogn1zed we had a problem w1th the op1o1d cr1s1s here 
1n Mame As a result, we created the Op1o1d Task Force and charged the group w1th develop1ng 
a plan to combat the cr1s1s wh1ch had metncs attached to 1t that we could use to gage progress 
each year In th1s Governor ’s ﬁrst year 1n ofﬁce, she created a group to create a long-term 
econom1c development strateg1c plan w1th a goal of us1ng metr1cs to determ1ne how we are domg 
w1th our state goal of econom1c growth 1n Mame We absolutely can do the same here and use 
the same approach 
If you fa1l to plan, you plan to fa11 I have seen many reports from OCF S and many documents 
outl1n1ng fa1lures, but I have not yet seen a plan to turn 1t around If one exlsts, I’m not pr1vy to 
1t, but perhaps some of you are If so, please share 1t wlth me as understandlng where we are 
fa1l1ng 1n that plan 1s cr1t1cal to tak1ng act1on to turn th1s problem around Plannlng 1s cr1t1cally 
lmportant 1n any orgamzatlon, and I can’t th1nk of an ofﬁce 1n state government where our 
attent1on to a plan 1s more needed and one where our fa1lure to do so leads to consequences that 
are most d1re and trag1c 
As you thoughtfully cons1der th1s measure, keep 1n m1nd Kendall Chlck, Mar1ssa Kemedy, 
Maddox W11l1ams, Harley Godmg and the other ch1ldren who have d1ed and all the others we 
don’t know about yet who are needlessly suffermg at the hands of those who are supposed to be 
protect1ng them 
Agam, thank you for your t1me and attentlon Let’s be part of the so1ut1on
