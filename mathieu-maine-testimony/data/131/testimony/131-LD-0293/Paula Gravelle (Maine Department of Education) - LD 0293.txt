Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 293, An Act to Revise the School Funding Formula proposes that the Department of 
Education to contract with a 3rd party, using existing resources and/or by seeking outside 
funding, to study the state’s essential programs and services education funding formula to 
detennine the amount and distribution of the state subsidy for municipalities and to provide 
alternative funding options. 
As outlined in Title 20-A, Chapter 606-B, §l 5686-A, individual components of the Essential 
Programs and Services (EPS) funding formula are reviewed on a rotating basis. These reports are 
submitted to the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee each year and can be found on the 
Department of Education website. These reviews are conducted every three years in groups of 
EPS components. With this approach, a segment of EPS is always under review. The EPS model 
was last reviewed in totality in a comprehensive study in 2013, completed by Lawrence Picus 
and Associates and commonly referred to as “the Picus report”. 
It is important to note the interconnectedness of EPS funding formula components. Individual 
component adjustments to the EPS formula always have positive and negative impacts on school 
administrative units (SAUs). Given the finite amount of funding, a calculation to increase one 
segment will necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine any one 
element in the context of the whole formula. In order to make equitable decisions that cause the 
least harm to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate time and resources to analyze the 
implications of any change. 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 293 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session. 
Sincerely,
