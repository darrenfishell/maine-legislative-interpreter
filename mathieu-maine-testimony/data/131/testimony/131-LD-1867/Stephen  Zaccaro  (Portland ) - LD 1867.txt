I'm writing in support of LD 1867. Social housing has been one of the the most 
effective forms of permanently affordable housing in other countries such as Vienna. 
Unlike our current model, social housing is not segregated and does not lead to 
stigma. This bill creates a new developer which will make us less dependent on 
private companies for our housing.
