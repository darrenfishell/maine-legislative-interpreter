Hello,
I attended MSSM from 2001 until 2004. I was originally from the Hampden, ME 
area.
Without MSSM, my entire life as it is today would not have been possible. I never 
thought technology and computer science was really an option for me. My schools 
didn't offer it, and I didn't know how to get started.
Going to MSSM, I had the opportunity to be surrounded by kids just like me, with a 
strong interest in academics, in an environment where we all could grow together. I 
met the late Duncan Innes, the Computer Science professor at the time, and he 
encouraged me to take a shot at the entry level class he offered. I loved it, and 
excelled, and that set me on the path that led me to where I am today. I met lifelong 
friends at MSSM. I now live in Los Angeles, working as a software engineer in a 
video game company, which has been my dream. Because of MSSM, and my 
education in Maine, I'm proud to tell people about where I'm from, and the 
opportunities that I had there. 
MSSM changed my life. I was fortunate in that my mother could afford room and 
board, but not everybody is that fortunate. There are kids all over Maine that will 
never have the opportunity, even though they are capable... which is a real loss for the
State of Maine. Additional funding can help bring those kids in, and allow them to 
grow up to their full potential. It'd be a shame to let that opportunity go to waste.
