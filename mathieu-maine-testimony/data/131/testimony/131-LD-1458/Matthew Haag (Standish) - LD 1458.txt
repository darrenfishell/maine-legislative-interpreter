LD 1458
To The Esteemed Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Matthew Haag, and I am a member of the class of 2001 of the Maine 
School of Science and Mathematics.  I am writing to ask for you to support LD1458 - 
An Act to Increase Funding for the Maine School of Science and Mathematics. 
Today I am a Principal Software Engineer and, with my wife, class of 1999, operate a 
Real Estate business across New England.  My life trajectory was dramatically 
impacted by the MSSM.  In addition to meeting my life partner and many lifelong 
friends, the MSSM provided me a space to learn without boundaries and gave me a 
profound sense of home and connection.  Without the social and educational skills I 
learned there, I would not have graduated with Distinction from the Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute, nor would I have received the funding I needed from WPI to 
attend. 
As I am sure you are aware, the inflation of the past 3 years has been hard on working
families and institutions to combat the constantly rising costs of necessities.  This has 
been doubly hard on the MSSM as its funding has been flat since 2017.  While the 
school and it’s leadership has been constantly dedicated to making do with the limited
means, it has meant a reduction in services and education, and an increase in the cost 
of room and board born by the current students and their families.  This pushes the 
costs of attendance of the MSSM to be out of reach of many of the youth of Maine 
who otherwise would greatly benefit from its educational and social opportunities.  
With this in mind I ask again for your support of LD1458 which will both provide 
additional funding to further the MSSM’s much needed education mission to the 
children of Maine as well as funding to reduce the burden on their families in the 
trying times.
Thank you,
Matthew Haag
