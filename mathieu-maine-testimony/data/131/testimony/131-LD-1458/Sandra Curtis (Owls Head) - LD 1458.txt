I whole heartedly encourage you to support this bill. My son spent his final 3 years of 
high school at MSSM, graduating in 2009. The knowledge and mentoring he received
at MSSM helped he and his classmates develop strong bonds and achieve great 
success in college and beyond. It is a place where high standards in academics are 
developed and supported to the highest degree. It's an educational experience that 
produce young people excited to excel in their further education. I want to see this 
opportunity continue for any eligible student and not become limited by parental 
income. That would be a tragedy. These MSSM students are part of our future. Thank
you for your support.
