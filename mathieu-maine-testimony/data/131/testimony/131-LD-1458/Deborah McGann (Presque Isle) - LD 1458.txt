Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee,
I
am
writing
to
let
you
know
the
importance
of
LD1458
-
An
Act
to
Increase
funding
for
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics.
As
a
parent,
I
can
attest
to
the
impact
of
MSSM
on
my
own
child.
As
someone
who
has
recently
had
honor
of
working
to
connect
with
hundreds
of
MSSM
alumni
to
document
their
educational
and
career
paths
I
can
speak
to
the
impact
on
many
other
Maine
students,
and
as
a
long
time
employee,
I
can
speak
to
the
impact
flat
funding
has
had
on
MSSM’ s
ability
to
deliver
it’ s
exceptional
program.
From
a
young
age,
our
son
Stephen
was
intensely
curious
and
imaginative
but
regarded
school,
even
kindergarten,
as
a
task.
That
all
changed
for
him
at
MSSM
where
he
truly
found
his
place.
He
had
walked
into
the
doors
with
little
confidence
and
emerged
two
years
later
with
his
head
held
high
equipped
with
the
social
and
academic
skills
for
success.
The
rigor
combined
with
the
support
of
staf f
and
peers
was
truly
transformative
for
him.
As
a
parent
I
will
be
forever
grateful.
At
the
same
time,
I
must
admit
that
had
I
not
received
employee
benefits,
our
family
would
have
seen
the
cost
of
attending
MSSM
prohibitive,
given
the
anticipation
of
upcoming
college
costs.
W e
likely
would
not
have
qualified
for
financial
aid,
but
without
knowing
in
advance
how
impactful
MSSM
would
be
for
our
son
we
would
not
have
been
in
a
position
to
appreciate
its
true
value.
Given
the
median
household
income
in
Maine
is
just
over
$63,000,
MSSM’ s
$9,800
current
room
and
board
fee
prevents
students
and
families
from
considering
MSSM
as
an
option
and
decreases
equity .
This
is
in
stark
contrast
to
the
room
and
board
subsidies
other
states
with
similar
institutions
provide
for
families.
LD1458
-
An
Act
to
Increase
Funding
for
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics
would
remove
this
barrier
for
Maine
Families.
And
our
son
is
just
one.
As
I
have
connected
with
other
alumni
from
the
pioneer
class
to
recent
graduates,
it
has
been
amazing
to
see
the
depths
and
breadths
of
their
accomplishments.
Hailing
from
all
sixteen
Maine
counties,
they
are
doctors,
lawyers,
educators,
programmers,
managers,
engineers,
counselors,
entrepreneurs,
the
list
goes
on
and
on.
Here
in
Maine
many
work
in
government,
education,
non-profit,
large
and
small
businesses.
A
recurring
theme
I
hear
is
not
only
the
schools
they
attended
and
the
degrees
they
earned,
but
the
research,
teaching,
and
learning
opportunities
in
college
their
MSSM
experiences
had
uniquely
prepared
them
for .
And
now
they
are
integral
parts
of
the
workforce
in
Maine,
the
Nation,
and
beyond.
But
without
the
passage
of
LD1458
-
An
Act
to
Increase
Funding
for
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics,
this
gem
in
the
crown
of
Maine
is
at
risk.
As
someone
who
has
worked
for
MSSM
for
over
25
years,
I
am
in
a
position
to
speak
in
earnest
about
how
flat
funding
has
impacted
MSSM
where
v
irtually
every
department
of
the
school
has
seen
cuts
over
the
past
six
years,
eliminating
and
reducing
key
positions
in
administration,
finance,
admissions,
teaching,
special
education,
and
residential
life.
While
I
have
not
been
personally
impacted
by
these
cuts,
I
have
seen
the
strain
on
the
remaining
workforce
who
have
creatively
gone
above
and
beyond
to
fill
the
gaps.
It
is
not
sustainable
and
will
impact
MSSM’ s
ability
to
attract
and
retain
its
talented
and
dedicated
staf f.
I
strongly
urge
you
to
pass
LD1458
and
work
with
your
colleagues
to
fully
fund
the
bill
to
preserve
the
magic
of
MSSM
for
Maine’ s
future
leaders.
Sincerely ,

Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to let you know the importance of LD1458 - An Act to Increase funding 
for the Maine School of Science and Mathematics. As a parent, I can attest to the 
impact of MSSM on my own child.  As someone who has recently had honor of 
working to connect with hundreds of MSSM alumni to document their educational 
and career paths I can speak to the impact on many other Maine students, and as a 
long time employee, I can speak to the impact flat funding has had on MSSM’s ability
to deliver it’s exceptional program.
From a young age, our son Stephen was intensely curious and imaginative but

and emerged two years later with his head held high equipped with the social and 
academic skills for success. The rigor combined with the support of staff and peers 
was truly transformative for him. As a parent I will be forever grateful. 
At the same time, I must admit that had I not received employee benefits, our family 
would have seen the cost of attending MSSM prohibitive, given the anticipation of 
upcoming college costs. We likely would not have qualified for financial aid, but 
without knowing in advance how impactful MSSM would be for our son we would 
not have been in a position to appreciate its true value.  
Given the median household income in Maine is just over $63,000, MSSM’s $9,800 
current room and board fee prevents students and families from considering MSSM as
an option and decreases equity. This is in stark contrast to the room and board 
subsidies other states with similar institutions provide for families. LD1458 - An Act 
to Increase Funding for the Maine School of Science and Mathematics would remove 
this barrier for Maine Families. 
And our son is just one. As I have connected with other alumni from the pioneer class

integral parts of the workforce in Maine, the Nation, and beyond.
But without the passage of LD1458 - An Act to Increase Funding for the Maine 
School of Science and Mathematics, this gem in the crown of Maine is at risk.  As 
someone who has worked for MSSM for over 25 years, I am in a position to speak in 
earnest about how flat funding has impacted MSSM where virtually every department
of the school has seen cuts over the past six years, eliminating and reducing key 
positions in administration, finance, admissions, teaching, special education, and 
residential life. 
While I have not been personally impacted by these cuts, I have seen the strain on the 
remaining workforce who have creatively gone above and beyond to fill the gaps. It is
not sustainable and will impact MSSM’s ability to attract and retain its talented and 
dedicated staff. I strongly urge you to pass LD1458 and work with your colleagues to
