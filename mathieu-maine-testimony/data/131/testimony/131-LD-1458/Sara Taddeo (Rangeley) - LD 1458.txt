LD 1458
I am writing to ask for your support for LD1458. As the parent of a 2011 and a 2019 
graduate of MSSM, I can attest to the great value of this extraordinary school.  Like 
many other students at MSSM, my son and my daughter found their ideally 
challenging and supportive environment at MSSM.  That foundation not only ensured 
their success in college and career, but provided mentoring and a peer group which 
enabled them to truly thrive, despite learning disabilities and their fatherâ€™s 
deployments overseas.
In my travels throughout the state, I have found that for far too many students, 
attending MSSM is an unattainable dream, due to the state-mandated charge for room 
& board, which has increased significantly and is now $9,800. Our state should be 
working to retain its brightest students and secure a better future for all our citizens by
supporting high-achieving students attending MSSM.  However, MSSM has been 
flat-funded since 2017, limiting staffing, enrichment and even supplies. If MSSM 
were granted funding which enabled it to eliminate the room and board cost, it would 
ensure more equitable access to this life-changing educational opportunity which 
benefits us all.
Please support LD1458 and increase funding to MSSM.
