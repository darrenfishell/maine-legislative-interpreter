I am a parent of a sophomore at MSSM. As a single mother with two children, as well
as being an educator in Maine, I would be unable to afford for my son who has 
thrived immensely at MSSM - the ability to attend with financial aid. Currently he 
receives almost a full scholarship to cover almost all of his room and board. He is 
brilliant and MSSM has gifted him the ability to thrive in an environment suited for 
his educational needs and goals. I am not alone in being unable to afford to cover 
room and board for my child to attend, and am forever grateful that I qualify for 
financial assistance. MSSM was a dream school for my child by his choice ever since 
he was in 3rd grade and he fought hard to reach his goal. Without his room & board 
being nearly covered - I would be unable to pay for his attendance. I am not alone in 
the situation I find myself in. Opening up the opportunity for all students, regardless 
of income, to be able to attend this incredible institution would be allowing for equal 
educational opportunity for all students regardless of income levels. MSSM is 
powerful and life changing for the students who go there. When you invest in the 
educational future of our childrenâ€¦ you invest in a better future for all of us. Please 
pass this bill!
