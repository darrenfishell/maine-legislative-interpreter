Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs,
greetings.
My
name
is
Michael
Delor ge
and
I
am
a
class
of
2020
graduate
of
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics
(MSSM).
I
ur ge
you
to
support
LD
1458
to
fund
the
school
that
af forded
myself
and
other
graduates
an
outstanding
education
while
giving
us
the
tools
to
contribute
to
our
state
in
the
future.
The
passage
of
this
bill
helps
ensure
a
better
future
for
the
school
that
my
peers
and
I
attribute
to
our
success.
I
am
originally
from
Biddeford,
Maine,
and
attended
Biddeford
High
School
for
my
freshman
year
before
embarking
on
my
journey
to
MSSM
for
my
last
three
years
of
high
school.
At
MSSM,
I
gained
practical
skills
that
set
me
up
for
academic
and
professional
success.
I
learned
how
to
manage
my
time,
advocate
for
myself,
and
engage
in
self-discovery .
I
left
home
for
MSSM
at
age
15
and
formed
indescribably
close
friendships
and
life-long
memories.
At
MSSM,
I
was
a
part
of
the
varsity
cross
country ,
volleyball,
and
track
teams;
Student
Senate;
the
astronomy
club,
the
award-winning
jazz
band;
and
the
Maine
Y outh
in
Government
(YIG)
program,
generously
hosted
in
the
Augusta
Statehouse.
Y outh
and
Government
and
my
MSSM
education
in
social
sciences
and
policy
changed
the
trajectory
of
my
life.
Before
attending
YIG,
I
wanted
to
be
a
doctor .
Now ,
I
attend
the
University
of
Maine
pursuing
a
career
in
public
health
policy .
I
currently
research
Maine’ s
substance
use
crisis,
intern
part-time
in
a
congressional
constituent
service
of fice,
and
was
recently
elected
student
body
president
at
UMaine
for
this
upcoming
academic
year .
MSSM
made
these
passions
and
experiences
possible.
I
hope
to
use
these
experiences
made
possible
by
my
MSSM
education
to
tackle
Maine’ s
healthcare
challenges
in
my
future
career .
W ith
MSSM
having
received
flat
funding
since
2017,
it
has
been
unable
to
provide
these
same
programs
and
services
or
attract
new
students,
faculty ,
and
staf f
to
its
Limestone
campus.
Rather ,
it
has
had
to
eliminate
positions,
slow
wage
growth,
and
reduce
student
services.
This
bill
helps
to
restore
funding
to
reasonable
levels,
allowing
MSSM
to
continue
providing
the
quality
education
that
our
state
and
its
students
deserve.
I
am
grateful
to
be
an
MSSM
graduate
and
I
hope
that
you
will
support
LD
1458
to
ensure
that
Maine’ s
future
students
have
access
to
these
same
opportunities
and
many
more.
Sincerely ,
