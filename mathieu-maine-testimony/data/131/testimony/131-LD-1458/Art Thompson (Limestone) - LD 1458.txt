RE: LD1458 Funding for the Maine State Science and Mathematics  
School in Limestone  
 
Dear Com mittee Members , 
 
I am one of the founders of MSS M and have been a close supporter and 
involved with the school f or over 30 years now .  I am appalled  at seeing 
the st ate flat funding the school for five years and expecting that to 
continue for two more.  Seven years without an y financial increase 
while the costs are going up everywhere is, I think, an embarras sment 
to the State .  In 2019, U.S. News & World Repo rt ranked MSS M second 
on its li st of America â€™s Best High Schools .  A point of pride for the entire 
state, I woul d think.  In 2022 that ranking dropped to 2,3 55th.  I would 
urge  the Commi ttee to support the amount requested in LD1458  so 
that our MSSM students have what they need to be successful stude nts 
and have the ir best chance of con tinuing th eir edu cation with their 
choice of universities.  It would be great to also see our ranking increase 
back into the top 20 , at l east.  
 
Than k you for your h elp and consideration.  
 
Best Regards ,
