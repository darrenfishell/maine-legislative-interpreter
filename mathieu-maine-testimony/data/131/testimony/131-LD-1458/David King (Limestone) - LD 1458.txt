To the Honorable Members of Maine’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  
 
My name is David King . I am a resident of Limestone and a member of the Board 
of Trustees of The Maine School of Science and Mathematics. I am writing today 
to ask for your support for LD 1458  – An Act to Increase Funding for The Maine 
School of Science and Mathematics.  
I have enjoyed a long and wonderful relationship with The Maine School of 
Science and Mathematics (MSSM).  My initial introduction was through my ability 
to provide assistance in the construction of MSSM’s Dormitory.  My wife and I 
later served as “host parents” for several students . Here I am today, a diehard 
supporter and a proud member of the Board of Trustees.  
As a member of the Board’s Finance and Faciliti es Committee, I have witnessed 
firsthand the harm suffered by the school through insufficient funding.  Flat 
funding since 2017 has necessitated constant reductions , to include the 
elimination of some positions, in order to continue to operate. Yet through out 
this absence of sufficient funding, there was a fierce determination by staff to 
continue to provide the same high quality  education for which MSSM is known . 
That same high quality education resulted in MSSM being recognized as the 2nd 
best high school  in the country in 2019.  The students, during these austere times, 
have been (and continue to be ) invaluable partners in their education.  I think we 
can all agree that these students are truly the future of our great State and its 
communities. As such, t hey deserve their high school education to be 
appropriately funded .  In order for this to happen, I (we) need your help. Your 
support of LD 1458 would be the beginning of a long term solution . 
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration and support of LD 1458.
