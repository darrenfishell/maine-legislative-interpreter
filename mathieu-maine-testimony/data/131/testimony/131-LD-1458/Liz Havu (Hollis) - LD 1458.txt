I am a parent of a 2009 MS SM graduate. I can personally attest to the 
importance MSSM has played in my son’s life. He would have run out 
of math by the time he was a junior in high school in his sending school. 
He went to MSSM and his eyes were open even wider. The best part is 
he went away to do his schooling and came back to his great State of 
Maine and currently works serving his state at the Department of 
Transportation.'

When my son \N’=€H4£-ff) MSSM it was $4500 a year for room and board. 
We, as middle class citizens had all we could do to afford to pay for his 
room and board. MSSM has been ﬂat-funded since 2017. Moreover, the 
cost to attend MSSM has increased signiﬁcantly and is now $9,800. I 
don’t know how middle class families can afford it. We should be 
working to do whatever we can as a state to help encourage high- 
achieving students to attend MS SM, a place where they can thrive. 
Seeing the room and board cost eliminated will reduce a signiﬁcant 
barrier for entry to countless Maine families, the very families that 
MSSM was designed to serve. 
This bill will help the brightest and best so that they can go on and 
continue to help the great State of Maine. Please support LDl458 and 
increase funding to MSSM.
