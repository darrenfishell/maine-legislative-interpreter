Dear
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee
Members,
My
name
is
Lily
Sage
and
I
am
a
2018
graduate
of
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and 
Mathematics.
I
am
writing
to
ask
for
your
support
for
LD1458
-
An
Act
to
Increase
Funding
for 
the
Maine
School
of
Science
and
Mathematics.
MSSM
has
received
flat
funding
for
the
past
six
years,
which
ef fectively
means
its
budget
has 
diminished
in
real
value
given
inflation.
The
ef fects
of
this—
the
elimination
of
positions, 
slowing
of
wage
growth,
and
reductions
in
student
services—
are
deeply
disappointing
outcomes 
of
the
flat
funding
model
and
should
be
seen
as
an
embarrassment
to
the
state.
This
is
a
magnet 
school
for
Maine’ s
highest-achieving
students,
and
as
such,
is
a
flagship
institution
that
our
state 
should
be
proud
of.
U.S.
News
and
W orld
Reports
certainly
thinks
so,
at
least,
having
ranked 
MSSM
the
#2
public
high
school
in
the
country
in
2019,
but
at
a
state
level
it
feels
as
though 
there
has
never
been
enough
political
willpower
to
value
and
accordingly
fund
this
school
as
the 
impressive
statewide
resource
it
is.
LD1458
will
help
restore
MSSM’ s
funding
to
an
adequate
(read:
less
shamefully
low)
level.
It 
will
also
help
ensure
that
students
from
less
privileged
backgrounds
can
af ford
to
attend
MSSM 
and
are
not
discouraged
from
applying
to
the
school
because
of
its
steep
sticker
price
for
room 
and
board.
As
a
student
who
received
financial
aid
to
attend
MSSM
for
four
years,
I
cannot 
overstate
how
grateful
I
am
for
the
excellent
education
and
incredible
opportunities
this
school 
provided
me
with.
At
MSSM
I
achieved
things
I
never
could
have
done
at
my
sending
school.
I
took
advanced 
classes
I
otherwise
never
would
have
had
access
to
and
felt
myself
finally
challenged
again
after 
waiting
years
to
experience
academic
rigor
in
school.
I
learned
from
brilliant
faculty
members, 
formed
lifelong
friendships
with
peers,
accessed
a
wide
range
of
academic
and
extracurricular 
experiences,
and
received
an
education
that
eventually
propelled
me
to
Bowdoin
College
on
a 
full
scholarship.
W ithout
MSSM,
I
don’ t
know
if
I
would
have
stayed
in
Maine
for
college,
let 
alone
after
college.
But
attending
MSSM
instilled
in
me
a
sense
of
pride
for
my
home
state
and 
now
I
hope
that
I
can
live
out
the
rest
of
my
life
here
in
Maine.
I
want
more
young
Mainers
to
access
the
wonderful
educational
opportunities
that
MSSM 
provided
me
with,
and
I
want
them
to
do
so
without
having
to
worry
about
the
cost
of
room
and 
board,
or
about
their
school’ s
meager
operating
budget.
MSSM
is
an
essential
resource
for 
Maine’ s
gifted
students,
and
they ,
like
all
students,
deserve
a
suf ficiently-funded
school. 
Ensuring
that
MSSM
receives
adequate
funding
rests
on
you,
our
state
legislators,
so
I
thank
you 
for
your
consideration
of
this
bill
and
sincerely
hope
that
I
can
count
on
your
support
for 
LD1458.
