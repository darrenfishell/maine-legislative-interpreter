TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ.  
 
Ought Not to Pass - LD 630 
 
An Act to Ensure Rural Law Enforcement Services in Maine  
 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY  
 
May 9, 2023  
 
Senator Be ebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety,  greetings .  My name is Michael 
Kebede, and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed 
to advancin g and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge you to oppose  LD 630 because it would 
expand a fundamentally flawed arm of state government.  
If enacted, this bill would fund new law enforcement services in rural Maine. This new 
expense, and these new positions, are entirely unnecessary , and we urge you to think about more 
effective places to invest limited state resources . Our state expenditure s must reflect our values. 
Over the past few years, it has become increasingly  clear that we have relied on the policing 
institutions in our state to solve challenges better suited to our healthcare, housing, and 
educational systems. Throughout Maine, a ti ny fraction of 9 -1-1 calls result in an arrest, and an 
even smaller fraction of that result in a use of force . In Westbrook, only 0.43% of 9 -1-1 calls in 
2019 resulted in a use of force.1 In Portland, officers used force in only 0.13% of 9 -1-1 calls in 
2019.2 The results have been disastrous for everyone, but especially for nonwhite Mainers, poor 
Mainers, and Mainers with disabilities. Our constitutional values of freedom from unreasonable 
state intrusions, of liberty and dignity, are not advanced by the criminalization of poverty or 
mental health challenges. Indeed, by neglecting human services and instead investing in policing,

 2 Maine and other states have turned law enforcement into de -facto social workers, healthcare 
workers, and investigators of minor traffic problems.3 Given the opportunities that we have to 
invest in housing and health care, choosing instead to fund new patrol positions is a missed 
opportunity.  
We urge you to vote ought not to pass .
