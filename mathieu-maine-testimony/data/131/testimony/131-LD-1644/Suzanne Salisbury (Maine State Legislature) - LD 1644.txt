T estzmony of Representatzve Suzanne Salzsbury presentmg 
LD 1644, An Act to Permit the Expenditure of Accumulated Tax Increment 
Revenues 
Before the Jomt Standmg Commzttee on T axatzon 
Senator Grohoskr, Representatlve Perry and esteemed members of the J o1nt Standmg 
Commlttee on Taxatlon, my name 1s Sue Sal1sbury I represent House D1str1ct 128, wh1ch 1s 
part of the town of Westbrook I am happy to present LD 1644, An Act to Permit the 
Expenditure of Accumulated Tax Increment Revenues. 
LD 1664 constltutes a m1nor but sens1ble change to Mame statute dealmg w1th when a Tax 
Increment Fmance (TIF) d1str1ct ends When you have a TIF d1st1'1ct 1n place and 1t comes to an 
end, mumc1pal1t1es often have some revenue left 1n the p1‘0_]CC1I account But state law does not 
tell you how or 1f you can spend those dollars For lots of commmntles, 1nclud1ng my own, th1s 
creates a real problem Because the law 1s s1lent on th1s 1ssue and the adm1mstrat1on ’s pos1t1on 
has been that all of the rema1mng ﬁmds need to be expended by the exp1rat1on date, 1f there are 
funds rema1mng, the c1ty stands to forfelt a portlon of those to Mame Revenue Servlces 
For a commumty 11ke Westbrook, and so many mun1c1pal1t1es around the state, TIFs have been 
an 1ncred1bly useful tool for economrc development Faclng the potentlal of g1v1ng up some of 
that money at the end of the d1str1ct ’s l1fe 1s not m keepmg w1th the sp1r1t of Ma1ne’s TIF law and 
does not beneﬁt Mamers 
Th1s b1l1 would clean up the statute by allowmg leftover revenue to rema1n 1n the account and to 
be used on author1zed projects for up to three years after the d1str1ct ends After that three year 
grace penod, any rema1mng funds must be returned to the mun1c1pa11ty ’s general fund 
Th1s b1ll 1s a stralghtforward cleanup of Ma1ne’s TIF laws and I encourage you to vote “Ought to 
Pass” to allow our mumc1pal1t1es th1s clar1ty so that they can more effectlvely ut1l1ze a cr1t1ca1 
development tool 
Thank you for the opportunrty to present th1s b1ll today I am happy to answer any quest1ons you 
may have, although I am certamly not an expert and I know that Dan Stevenson, Westbrook ’s 
ECOIIOIIIIC Development Dlrector, 1s also hear and may be better able to address your quest1ons
