In Support of  
LD 1644 , An Act  to Permit the Expenditure of Accumulated Tax Increment Revenues  
 
May 10, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in support of LD 1644  on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Leg islative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
Municipal officials support LD 1644 because it provides communities  options for 
expending the revenue that remains once a tax increment financing (TIF) district expires .  The 
options presented in the bill are thoughtful  and relate  to the intended purpose of the district .  
Also, by  requiring the tax shift adjustment ( proposed in section  4.C), the initiative  recognize s 
that the process of  sheltering value  has adverse impacts on other municipalities as it pertains to 
the distribution of school aid and revenue shar ing and the assessment of county taxes.    
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our p osition, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
