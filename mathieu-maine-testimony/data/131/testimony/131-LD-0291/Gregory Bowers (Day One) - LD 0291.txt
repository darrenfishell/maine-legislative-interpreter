Testimony In support of LD 291: An Act to Support Young People Affected by 
Substance Use Disorder 
 
Good day, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee.  I am offering this written testimony in support of LD 
291, “An Act to Support Young People Affected by Substance Use Disorder”.  My 
name is Greg Bowers, and I am the Chief Executive Officer of Day One, an 
organization that has provided substance use and mental health treatment to 
adolescents and families in Maine for well over forty-five years.  Throughout much of 
its history, and continuing today, Day One has provided residential treatment for 
adolescent boys and girls suffering from acute substance use disorder.  Currently we 
are the only provider in the State offering this level of care for young people.  Day One 
knows firsthand from many years of experience, what types of supports are needed to 
give youth suffering from acute substance use disorder the best chance at long-term 
recovery.  
 
Almost aways, long term recovery from substance use disorder at any age is a 
nonlinear, iterative process that is highly specific to the individual.  Recovery for 
young people can be even more complicated given that youth tend to be less motivated 
to change, have lower problem recognition and acceptance, and often enter treatment 
because of external reasons (someone is making them go).  Relapse in this population 
can be very high. One study found that “among youth treated for alcohol or drug 
problems, one third to one half are likely to return to some drug use at least once 
within 12 months following treatment”. (1)  Research also shows that “continuing care, 
or aftercare, for adolescents also has been repeatedly shown to reduce the likelihood of 
relapse and enhance the maintenance of treatment gains”. (2) 
 
Recovery high schools have proved to be an effective form of continuing care in many 
parts of the country.  Recovery High Schools are secondary schools designed 
specifically for students in recovery from substance use disorder or co-occurring

disorders.  Given the large need for this level of support in the client’s Day One serves, 
our Agency has explored the feasibility of introducing such a model in our own State 
as a potentially critical component of an effective continuum of care.  As part of this 
exploration, we visited several such programs and have found that they can be 
structured and operated very differently from each other depending on available 
community resources, population demographics and state goals / standards.  Much can 
be learned from these very impressive schools. 
 
Day One strongly supports the notion of a broad based, comprehensive study of 
recovery high school models and their potential value in serving youth in recovery 
from substance use disorder – particularly in such a rural State as ours.  Day One has 
no doubt as to the need for this level of support, and is more than willing to participate 
and assist in any such effort.   
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to submit this testimony.          
 
 
Respectfully Submitted 
 
Gregory Bowers 
Chief Executive Officer
