Re: Testimony in opposition to LD 1431, “An Act Requiring the Public Utilities 
Commission to Adopt Rules Promoting Renewable Energy” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1431 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable Energy 
Association (“MREA”). 
The sponsor’s amendment aims to reshape the entire Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) 
marketplace by removing biomass, landﬁll gas, waste to energy a.nd hydropower from RPS 
eligibility through the introduction of a new “naturally regenerative and certiﬁed green” 
standard. By removing such a wide swath of clean energy sources from our RPS this will have 
the effect of tightening supply and thus causing prices to increase — in fact, it may even cause 
competitive electricity providers (CEP) to instead choose to pay the Alternative Compliance 
Payment (ACP). As this committee knows, the ACP creates a natural price cap, but our energy 
policies have been designed in such a way that CEPs rarely choose to pay it — and this is the ideal 
outcome. 
The new Thermal Energy Credit portfolio requirement illustrates what is likely to happen if we 
restrict certain renewables from participating in the traditional RPS market. According to the 
Maine Public Utilities Commission ’s 2022 Annual Report (dated 2/ l/23)‘: 
A 2020 rulemaking proceeding (Docket No. 2020-00212) resulted in changes to 
Chapter 311 to implement the new thermal energy credit portfolio (TREC) 
requirement. 2021 was the first year with a TREC requirement. The Commission 
only approved five TREC projects by the end of May 2022. As a result of 
inadequate TREC supply in the marketplace, the bulk of the TREC obligation 
was fulfilled by Alternative Compliance Payments (ACP), equaling approximately 
$700,000. As required by statute, the Commission fon/varded the ACP money to 
the Efficiency Maine Trust.

Further, if the goal is to create a unique class of renewables to serve Maine consumers, then the 
CEP marketplace can accomplish this goal under current law. We suspect this may not be 
happening already because there is insufﬁcient consumer demand for a subset of clean energy. 
We respectfully urge you to vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
