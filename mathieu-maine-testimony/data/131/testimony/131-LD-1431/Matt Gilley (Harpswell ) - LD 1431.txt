LD 1431
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence Representative Zeigler and members of the energy 
utilities and technology committee. My name is Matt gilley and I am a lifelong 
resident of Harpswell. I am writing to you today in opposition of ld 1431. My biggest 
objection to this legislation is incentivizing people to put heat pumps in their home. 
Most home owners insurance doesn’t considering heat pumps primary sources of 
heat. If people are incentivized to remove fossil fuel heating systems and replace them
with more energy efficient ones we need to make sure they will work year round and 
we are not at that point. While I understand the need to transition to a greener form of 
energy this needs to be done in a timely calculated fashion and that is not happening. 
The idea that not all dams are considered green energy unless a proper fish ladder is 
installed but wind turbines that studies show have a detrimental effect on fish and 
marine life are? Also landfill gas that is being released no matter what isn’t green 
energy? Unfortunately landfills aren’t being down away with so why not utilize the 
gas that’s going to be produced no matter what? Furthermore we already know some 
of these green energy programs are costly to install. Especially offshore wind. If the 
company can’t pass on the costs through rates to the consumer how are we going to 
subsidize these companies or incentivize them to build them? Thank you for your 
time.
