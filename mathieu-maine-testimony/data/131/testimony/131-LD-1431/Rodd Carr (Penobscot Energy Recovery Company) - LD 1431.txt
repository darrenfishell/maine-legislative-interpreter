GOOD AFTER NOON SENATOR LAWRENCE, REPRESENTATIVE ZIEGLER, 
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON, ENERGY, UTILITIES, AND 
TECHNOLOGY. ' ' 
MY NAME IS ROD CARR, AND I AM THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGER AT 
PENOBSCOT ENERGY RECOVERY COMPANY (PERC) LOCATED IN 
ORRINGTON, MAINE. 
I WISH TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO A PROPOSED 
SPONSOR AMENDMENT TO LD 1431. 
PERC, LOCATED IN ORRINGTON, MAINE IS ONE OF THREE WASTE-TO- 
ENERGY FACILITIES LOCATED IN MAINE. FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS, 
PERC HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN MAINE'S SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT 
HIERARCHY, THAT CONVERTS WASTE MATERIAL TO FUEL TO GENERATE 
ELECTRICITY KEEPING WASTE OUT OF LANDFILLS BY REDUCING WASTE 
BY MORE THAN 9.0 % BY VOLUME. 
PERC IS A ZERO LIQUID DISCHARGE WASTE-TO-ENERGY FACILITY THAT 
COMBUSTS MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE, AND IS PART OF AN INTEGRATED 
MATERIALS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT CONVERTS WASTE 
MATERIALS INTO RENEWABLE ELECTRIC POWER, WHICH QUALIFIES IT 
FOR CERTAIN CLASS 2 RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS.I 
PERC IS PART OF THE NEW ENGLAND POWER POOL AND IS 
RECOGNIZED BY ISO NEW ENGLAND AS A RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITY.
AS YOU CAN SEE, AND AS STATED PREVIOUSLY, WASTE—TO-ENERGY 
FACILITIES PROVIDE IMPORTANT PIECES TO THE SOLID WASTE 
MANAGEMENT BY REDUCING THE VOLUME OF SOLID WASTE BY MORE 
THAN 90%, KEEPING THAT WASTE OUT OF LAND FILLS, AND IN 
ADDITION, IT USES THAT SOLID WASTE AS FUEL TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC 
POWER TO THE GRID. 
IN 2018 PERC PROCESSED MORE THAN 200,000 TONS OF REFUSE 
DERIVED FUEL (RDF) THAT GENERATED NEARLY 150,000 mw OF 
ELECTICITY, ENOUGH TO POWER NEARLY 15,000 HOMES. 
OVER THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS ALL CITIZENS, AND‘ ALSO 
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY COVID AND OTHER ISSUES THAT 
HAVE CAUSED ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE IN THEIR OPERATIONS IN 
ORDER TO SURVIVE. AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO PERC'S SURVIVAL 
DURING THESE TIMES HAS BEEN THE CLASS 2 RECS THAT PROVIDED THE 
REVENUE TO MEET PAYROLL, AND CONTINUE OPERATIONS. WITHOUT 
THAT REVENUE PERC MAY HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF BUSINESS. 
IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
THAT CAME IN JUST BEFORE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND MADEA 
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THE BILL, CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE. 
WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE REMOVE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
FROM THE ORIGINAL, AND VOTE OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
