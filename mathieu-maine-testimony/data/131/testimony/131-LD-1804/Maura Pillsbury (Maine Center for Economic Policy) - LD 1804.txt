Testimony in Support of LD 1804, An Act to Provide Transparency and Accountability for 
Corporate Tax Expenditures 
May 1 1, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is 
l\/laura Pillsbury and I am an analyst at the l\/iaine Center for Economic Policy. I am here today 
to testify in support of LD 1804. LD 1804 would provide the Legislature and the public with 
more information about some of the largest business tax breaks in l\/iaine, including: 
~ the Pine Tree Development Zone program 
v the Employment Tax increment Financing program 
o the Business Equipment Tax Exemption and Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement 
0 the Shipbuilding Facility Credit 
We discuss several of the pitfalls of current business tax giveaway data collection and 
transparency in Maine in our recent report Are Tax Giveaways Worth the Money? including: 
- program data to measure outcomes is often either not collected, inaccessible, or 
unreliable 
o limited data access and availability make program effectiveness difﬁcult to determine 
o data limitations often mean OPEGA cannot fully review the impact of tax giveaway 
programs 
- as a result, lawmakers have inadequate program information to inform policy decisions 
A recent report“ from Good Jobs First also found Maine's transparency on business tax 
giveaways ranks among the worst in the nation due to the lack of data transparency, behind 
states including Texas and Nevada who publicly post their data. 
We urge the Committee to consider what information is collected about business tax subsidies 
as a whole and how this could be improved. l\/iaine loses over $1 billion per year to these 
programs, with little evidence to show that they deliver on the promises they make. As we have 
testified previously, the Legislature, public, and agencies should understand how well these 
programs are working and opportunities to improve them. And lawmakers need to be able to 
weigh the beneﬁt of business tax subsidies against other types of investments in our state like 
education, affordable housing, and other services families and businesses rely on. WeA 
appreciate Senator Bennett putting forward this bill and encourage the Committee to consider 
what additional data would be helpful across all of iviaine’s business tax subsidy programs.
