Dear Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry , and esteemed members of the Committee,  
 
I am writing regarding  LD 1804 , An Act to Provide Transparency and Accountability for 
Corporate Tax Expenditures . The bill calls for additional reporting to the Legislature on certain 
business incentive programs, including two that the Department manages : Pine Tree 
Development Zone s and Employment Tax Increment Financing (ETIF) . Specifically, it adds new 
information requirements to the Pine Tree Development Zone report and institutes a new annual 
reporting requirement for ETIF.  
 
We thank the sponsor for the interest in incentive transparency, which is an interest  the 
Department shares. The Department has been modernizing our data system in order to improve 
tracking and reporting capacity , which means it will not be difficult to compile annual reports for 
the Legislature using the information we collect in the course of administering these programs . 
 
Additionally, s ome committee members may be aware that our department is working on  a 
forthcoming bill  sponsored by President Jackson  to modernize the Pine Tree Development Zone 
and ETIF programs. We have built evaluation tools into the legislation for that proposal,  Dirigo 
Business Incentives,  to allow us to assess the impact of the program more easily if it becomes 
law.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Phoenix McLaughlin  
Tax Incentive Policy Manager
