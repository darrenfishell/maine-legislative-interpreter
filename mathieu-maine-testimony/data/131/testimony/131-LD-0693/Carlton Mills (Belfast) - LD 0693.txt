LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Carlton Mills and I live in Belfast. I spend the summer on Lake St 
George. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit 
large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ 
deep.  
I am concerned that repeated large wakes close to shore will damage/erode the 
shoreline, disturb the natural shoreline environment both onshore and in the water, 
and pose a danger to children.  I have six grandchildren ages 2 to 11 that use the lake 
repeatedly in the summer.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating 
boats on the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely .
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Sincerely,
Carlton L Mills
