Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Marian Nangle and I spend the summer on Pitcher Pond in
Northport, ME. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would
prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less
than 20’ deep.
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will damage my new docks, pose
a risk to young children, and capsize people kayaking or using wakeboards.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep
large-wake-generating boats on the water but direct them to places where they
can operate safely because this will eliminate these threats and others.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating
opportunities for everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Signed,
Marian Nangle, Nor thpor t, seasonal, Pitcher P ond
