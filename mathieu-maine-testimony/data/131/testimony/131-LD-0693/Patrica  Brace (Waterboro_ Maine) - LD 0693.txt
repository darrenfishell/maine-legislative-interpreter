LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Patricia Brace and I live in Waterboro, ME on Lake Arrowhead. I am 
asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
Lake Arrowhead is experiencing considerable shoreline erosion due to boat wake. 
The effects of the erosion is usually hidden from sight but is clearly visible when the 
water level is low. In places, up to six feet of soil has been removed from underneath 
the shoreland vegetation. Trees along the shoreline can be seen leaning towards the 
water and eventually fall in as the substrate below is removed by boat wake. Boat 
wake is actually killing trees and contributes to higher levels of siltation of the water 
bodies.
The wake generated by wake boats on Lake Arrowhead produces waves that are so 
large that they actually break, and crash onto the shoreline. Waves even wash right 
over docks. It has to stop.
LD 693 is a solution that will keep large waves away from our fragile lake shorelines.

Please vote to support LD 693 to help preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank you.
Signed,
