Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
 
Our family owns a waterfront property on Hancock Pond, which we purchased in 1993.  It is 
the most important place in our family life, and we spend a great deal of time on the water 
and on the shore.
The recent arrival of wake boats has caused significant erosion to our shoreline, and 
made it harder to kayak and canoe safely, especially with young children.
I urge you to support the passage of LD 693 to reduce the negative impact of wake 
boats operating close to shore.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to 
pass” on LD 693.
