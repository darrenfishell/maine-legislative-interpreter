Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
Our names are Colette Dumas and Sandy Hovey. We spend our 
summer and boat on Norway Lake (Pennesseewassee Lake). We are 
asking your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large 
wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 
20’ deep.
We are concerned that large wakes close to shore will damage the shore 
and create extensive erosion, as well as damage docks, and present a 
danger to swimmers by the shore.  
We support LD 693 as a practical solution that will allow large-wake-
generating boats on the water, while directing them to places where they 
can operate safely, without creating extensive erosion, damage to docks, 
and danger to swimmers near shore. 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating 
opportunities for everyone on our publicly owned ponds and lakes.
Thank you very much.
Signed
Colette Dumas and Sandy Hovey, Norway, Norway Lake.
