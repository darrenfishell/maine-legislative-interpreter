LD 693
Dear members of the fisheries and wildlife committee,
I am writing to add my voice to the discussion of LD 693, act to protect inland water quality, 
shorelines, wildlife and public safety.  My husband Bruce Sanford and I have a camp on 
Saturday Pond in Otisfield. He has been on the pond since 1953 along with his brother and 
sister. The pond is 179 acres. It has a maximum depth of 25 feet. We have seen over recent 
years with the advent of the wake boats damage to the shoreline, cutting in tearing of aquatic 
plant life, water turbidity, and damage to docks and property. please help take this positive 
step forward to protect our waters and maintain a healthy shoreline and robust buffers by 
voting ought to pass on LD693. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important 
bill.
