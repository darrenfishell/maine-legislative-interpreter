LD 693: An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife, and Public 
Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close 
to Shore or in Shallow Water
I am a year-round resident on the shore of Little Ossipee Lake, in Waterboro Maine, and have
been active on this lake for 50 years. As an experienced boater, I have been alarmed by the 
development of Wake Boats and their devastating impact upon our pristine shoreline over 
these last few years. 
These Wake Boats were never intended for use on a small body of water such as ours. They 
are wreaking havoc with our docks, boats, and the fragile shoreline. In this short period of 
time these unnaturally tall and strong waves have eroded the soil, creating a sandy swimming
area and undermined the shore so that I can reach my entire arm under the bank. The edge 
of our shore has dropped several inches and upset the landing of our dock. This damage is 
severe and irreversible. 
Our small grandchildren have been knocked off their feet by these waves, which are a threat 
to public safety. 
Our docks and boats are dashed against each other by the unnaturally strong waves. The 
docks suffer irreparable damage as have the hulls of our boats. 
These Wake Boats are not made for small lakes in Maine. Just because one can do 
something does not mean they should.
