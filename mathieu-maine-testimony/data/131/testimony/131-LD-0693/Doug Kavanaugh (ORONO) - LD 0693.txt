LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Doug Kavanaugh.  I live at Gould's Landing on Pushaw Lake in Orono, 
Maine.  I am asking for your support for L. D. 693, a bill that would prohibit large 
wake-generating boats from within 500 feet of shore and in water less that 20 feet 
deep.
I am concerned that the large wakes generated by this technology will hasten the 
erosion of the shoreline of my property.  In the fifteen years that I have lived at 
Gould's Landing I have noted the loss of at least one foot of land on parts of my 
shoreline.  Gould's Landing is the major access point to Pushaw Lake.  We have, then,
higher than usual boat traffic.  I assure you the 200-foot headway zone is poorly 
honored, especially by those on jet skis (another large wake-producing watercraft).  
To encourage watercraft designed to create huge wakes on this shallow lake is folly 
indeed.  Wakes of these proportions will not only further erode the shoreline but flood
loon nesting sites and be hazardous to those in canoes and kayaks.
I support L. D. 693 as a common-sense solution to a budding significant problem.  It 
will be far easier and less expensive to regulate this potentially disastrous technology 
now than pay to mitigate the damages later.
Please vote to support L. D. 693 as a way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to comment on this proposed legislation.
Signed,
Doug Kavanaugh, year-round resident on Pushaw Lake, Orono.
