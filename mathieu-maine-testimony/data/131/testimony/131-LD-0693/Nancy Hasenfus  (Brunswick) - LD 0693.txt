Please pass LD 693.  I summer on Lake Androscoggin and for the last 3 years we have had 
trouble with algae blooms and invasives species.  Wake boat will make both of these worse.
    Our lake is quite shallow and wake boats stir up the bottom causing  more phosphorus in 
the water leading to toxic blooms. The waves produced by them also can injure loons ,small 
children and pets.  With their  ballast tanks, they are a set up for transferring small particles of
invasive plants from one lake to another.  
   Please protect Maine lakes.
