Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to 
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
 
My name is Gregory Moser and my wife and I live in Portland, with a part-time cabin in 
Washington County. My email address is vtsec11@hotmail.com.
I am a retired fish and wildlife biologist and fisherman. My family and I enjoy the use of 
lakes, ponds and streams throughout Maine, to relax in the water and commune with the 
natural world, while enjoying our friends and sharing the lake/pond with others.
I heard about LD 693 the other day from a friend, and I was very concerned to learn of the 
explosion of wake boats in lakes and waters of Maine and that there are no rules to 
specifically regulate this new, and more impactful, form of watersport.  We need to regulate 
this growing sport now, to mitigate most negative impacts, rather than too late.
I am very concerned for the social, physical, and associated biological impacts that wake 
boats will cause, especially in shallower waters. Specifically, I am concerned that the design 
of these boats will significantly impact water bottoms and shores causing erosion and 
sedimentation, with associated large impacts to fish and wildlife habitats. It will also be a 
hazard to people and their dwellings and infrastructure. 
After reading a summary of LD 693, I am convinced that this thoughtful bill will offset 
impacts to shallow and near shore waters and allow enjoyment and safety for people, their 
dwellings, and environs. Based on my experience and expertise, 500 feet from shore and 
minimum 20 feet water depth, are good minimum requirements for this bill.
       I urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 693.
