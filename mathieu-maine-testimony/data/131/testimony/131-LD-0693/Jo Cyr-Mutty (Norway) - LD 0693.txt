Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
 
My name is Jo Cyr-Mutty and I grew up and now spend much of the summer in Norway, 
Maine on Lake Pennesseewassee, I am writing to ask for your support today for LD 693, a bill
that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less 
than 20’ deep.  
 
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will continue to erode the shoreline, damage 
docks, and pose a risk to young children. 
 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will allow large-wake-generating boats to 
use the lakes for recreation by directing them to places where they can operate safely while 
also keeping the shoreline, property, small children playing in the water near the shoreline 
and wildlife safe.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Respectfully, 
Jo Cyr-Mutty
