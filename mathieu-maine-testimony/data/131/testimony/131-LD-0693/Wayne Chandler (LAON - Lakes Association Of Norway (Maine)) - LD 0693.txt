LAON - Lakes Association Of Norway (Maine)
LD 693
Born in Lewiston and raised in Norway, I have a lifelong love of Maine.  I grew up on
Lake Pennesseewassee in Norway.  Now at 76, I spend my winters in Palm Springs, 
CA and as much of the summer as possible in Norway, Maine.
Having attended Maine Maritime Academy and spending 34 years in the United 
States Coast Guard I'd like to think I have a basic knowledge of headway speed and 
what exceeding it can do to an unprotected shoreline.
In addition to shoreline - dock and boat damage, there is a real danger to folks in the 
water or on the docks.
I am in total support of LD 693. 
Thank you.
