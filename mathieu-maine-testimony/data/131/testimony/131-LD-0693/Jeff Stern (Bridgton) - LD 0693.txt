Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Jeff Stern and I live year-round in the Woods Pond Watershed (off the lake) in 
Bridgton. In addition, my family has owned a camp on the shore of Woods Pond since 1977. 
I am a board member on the Woods Pond Association.
I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
As an environmental consultant, I have worked on many lake watershed surveys and erosion 
control projects. I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will increase shoreline 
erosion, and also pose a safety risk to swimmers, especially young children. 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats 
on the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,  
Jeff Stern
