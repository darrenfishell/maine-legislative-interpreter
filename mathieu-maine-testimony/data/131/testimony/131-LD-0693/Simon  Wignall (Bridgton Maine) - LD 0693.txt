As a wakeboat owner and a lake front owner, I take shoreline conservation seriously.  
Wake boats have been on maine lakes for well over 10 years and I've seen no 
appreciable damage to any shoreline.  I swim in the same waters close to shore and 
I've seen no damage.  Waves of the same size occur naturally all summer long since 
these lakes were formed.  The loon would be a good study case because they nest 
close to shore and nests could be damaged.  The number of loons on Long lake have 
increased in the last 10 years even as the number of wakeboats has increased.
