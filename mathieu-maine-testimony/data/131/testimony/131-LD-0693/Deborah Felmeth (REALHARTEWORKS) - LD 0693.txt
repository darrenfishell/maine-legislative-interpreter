LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
 
My name is Deborah Felmeth and I have spent 70 summers enjoying living and boating on 
Lake Pennesseewassee in Norway, Maine. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a 
bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less
than 20’ deep.  
 
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will damage the ecosystem of the lake by 
disturbing the lake bottom, as well as increase shoreline erosion, and potentially damage 
property such as docks, floats and moored boats. Additionally I believe wake boats pose a 
risk to swimmers near shore.
 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely, in deeper water and 500’ 
distance from shore.
 ﻿
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
 
Signed,
