LD 693
I ask you to support LD 693.  It is a common sense measure to mitigate the 
detrimental shoreline effects of powerful wake boats.  I live on Lake Wassookeag, 
Dexter year round and already see the stress powerful motorboats have on the 
shoreline and water fowl, especially the loons.  Loons are still on their nests till late 
July here and the large waves and noise add to the mothers already difficult burden of 
hatching and raising her chick(s).  I feel that we as a species do not have the right to 
harm or stress other species in the name of pleasure.
