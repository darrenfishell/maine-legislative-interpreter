Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, We are writing in support of LD 693.  My family (Vauclain) has owned property and homes on Kezar Lake since 1898, owning over 900' of shore line.  We have been respectful of the rules and traditions of the lake and are committed to preserving the beauty and pristine quality of the lake.  
We are owners of a wake boat and understand the importance of using enhanced wakes only in water that is deeper than 20' and when at least 500' from shore.  
We support LD 693 to preserve the safety and fragile ecosystems of Maine's lakes, while simultaneously supporting wake surﬁng in appropriate waters.
Sincerely
Peter Rohr
