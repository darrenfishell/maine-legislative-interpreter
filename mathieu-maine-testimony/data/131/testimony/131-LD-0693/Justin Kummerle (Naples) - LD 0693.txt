Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to 
Shore or in Shallow Water "  
  
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,  
  
My name is Justin Kummerle. My wife and I have a place on Brandy pond in Naples Maine.  
 
These wake boats cause far too much shore land erosion , this disturbs the nat ural ha bitats 
and not only my shore line but everyone ’s. this causes any beach areas to wash away , 
expose roots, turn up sediment and create poor water quality.  
 
We are in favor of LD 693  thus Banning wake boats/ wake boarding within 500 ’ of the shore 
as well  as banning this activity on bodies of water less than 20 ’ in depth  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
