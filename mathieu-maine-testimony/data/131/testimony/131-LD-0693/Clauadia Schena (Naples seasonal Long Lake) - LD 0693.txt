Naples seasonal Long Lake
LD 693
I absolutely support this bill. My only concern is that it may not go far enough to stop 
the damage to our lakes and the erosion of our shore land. We have experienced 
significant erosion since the introduction of these boats to our lake.  Last summer we 
had clumps of grass and debris floaty by our dock that I'd never seen in the 25+ years 
we've been there.  The crystal clear water is now often cloudy from the churning 
caused by the wake boats.  Our grandchildren cannot swim because the waves 
overtake them and  push them into our rocky shore.  My 74 year old husband 
sustained a leg injury when waves propelled him into the rocks.  My concern is that 
even when these boats are in the middle of the lake, we still experience these issues. 
However, we support any restrictions you may implement that might help.  Thank you
for this opportunity to voice our concerns.  They are in no way exaggerated or 
embellished.
