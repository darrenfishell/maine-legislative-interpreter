LD 693
Dear Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee Members:
I am submitting this testimony in regard to LD 693 which concerns Wake Boats'
I have a camp on Wesserunsett Lake in Madison. I have participated in monitoring its water 
quality since 1982 and in tracking its loon population since 1983. I have also been involved in 
its CBI program. I am a retired biologist whose career included working for IF&W and USFWS
as well as  private environmental consulting. I  have contacted a Maine aquatic scientist 
regarding the impacts of Wake Boats and have found that recent research indicates this bill 
should be amended in order to even have a chance of protecting Maine lakes. Wake Boats 
should not operate in any waters less than 25 feet in depth or within 1000 feet of shorelines. 
This still would not eliminate impacts on other lake users such as fishermen and 
non-motorized watercraft people.  There is a limit to what our lakes can be used for without 
serious impacts, Using Wake Boats exceeds that threshold unless strictly regulated. Thank 
you for any consideration you may give these comments.
