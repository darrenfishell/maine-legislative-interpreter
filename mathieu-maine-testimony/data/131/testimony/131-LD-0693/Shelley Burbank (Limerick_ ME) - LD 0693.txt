LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Shelley Burbank. I live in Limerick, ME in the Lake Arrowhead 
Community. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit
large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ 
deep. 
Lake Arrowhead is suffering substantial shoreline erosion due to large boat wakes 
that are purposefully generated with no regard to the harmful effects to others’ 
property, our shared environment, and to overall lake health.
I don’t believe wake boats are appropriate for any Maine lakes, but especially Lake 
Arrowhead which is narrow and shallow.  The large waves “break” on the shoreline, 
drag soil out into the water, and even go over the tops of docks. There are probably 
many other lakes suffering similar damage. Where shorelines erode. Where trees 
become unstable and tip into the water. Where nests and other animal habitats are 
potentially threatened.
Let’s preserve our beautiful lakes and shorelines for future generations of Mainers.
It is our responsibility as human beings to protect our natural resources as best we 
can, when we can. So much is out of our control when it comes to environmental 
changes…but this problem is solvable! Please vote to support LD 693 to help 
preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank you very much for serving Maine in 
our legislature.
Signed,
