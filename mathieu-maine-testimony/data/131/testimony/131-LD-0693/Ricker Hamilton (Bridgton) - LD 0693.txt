LD 693
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and Members of the Committee on Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife, I write to you in opposition of LD 693, ‘An Act to Protect 
Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and Public Safety by Prohibiting 
Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to Shore or in Shallow 
Water”.
I am concerned about the accuracy of the Minnesota research that suggested that 
wakes should be kept 500 feet from shore; possible unintended consequences of LD 
963 and the creation of another unnecessary law.  I encourage the Committee and 
others to work with Maine citizens, boat owners and representatives of Maine boating
industry to gather more information and facts.  For example, I understand that the 
National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA) has supported 
a 200-foot wake safety zone and that the National Marine Manufacturers Association 
(NMMA) has reviewed the Minnesota wake study and from their analysis has 
developed a list of flaws in that study.  We should also look to other neighboring 
states like New Hampshire and see how they have effectively dealt with similar 
Legislative proposals.
I live on Moose Pond in Bridgton, Maine, in a cottage we have owned since 1990. As 
a life-long Maine resident, I have enjoyed Maine’s lakes and ponds.  We have owned 
three wake boats through the years which have provided our family with many hours 
of enjoyment in Maine’s summers.  Wake boats are very safe and operate around 10 
MPH when surfing.  I am concerned that LD 693 would create a safety hazard for us 
on Moose Pond if all operation is limited to a small zone in the middle of our pond.
Thank you for accepting this brief testimony.  I look forward to the Committee’s work on LD 
693 and commit to further assistance if the Committee desires.
