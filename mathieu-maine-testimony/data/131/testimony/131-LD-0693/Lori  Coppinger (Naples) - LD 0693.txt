LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Lori Coppinger and I have spent the summers on Trickey Pond in Naples 
since 1977.  I have grown up through my teenage years, early adulthood now into 
semi-retirement, spending summers on the pond.  I am asking for your support today 
for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of
shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will lead to the deterioration of the 
shoreline properties, causing further erosion affecting the environment, and impacting
the island area in which the loons nest.  They used to nest and have offspring annually
now it is not an annual event nor is it even a guaranty that they will continue to nest in
the area.  The large wakes also pose a physical risk to the residents and visitors who 
use the lake for more leisurely activities such as swimming, fishing, kayaking and 
paddleboarding.  There is an increase risk of getting tossed around, flipped over 
and/or overcome by the waves caused by these large wake generating boats in smaller
more confined areas. 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating 
boats on the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely because of 
larger space to absorb the wakes created by such boats.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Respectfully,
Lori Coppinger
