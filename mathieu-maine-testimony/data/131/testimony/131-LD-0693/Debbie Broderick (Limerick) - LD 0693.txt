LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Debbie Broderick and I live year round in Limerick, ME on Lake 
Arrowhead. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit 
large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ 
deep.  
As a lakefront homeowner, I have noted extensive shoreline erosion due to boat wake.
Shoreline is being undercut and leads to collapse, causing leaning trees to eventually 
fall in. Boat wake destabilizes banks and edges, and releases more silt into the water. 
The shoreline erosion that homeowners suffer from wake boat use is totally 
unacceptable. Without the shoreline vegetation as a buffer, more runoff from our 
properties carries sediment into the lake.
The powerful waves generated by wake boats on Lake Arrowhead produces impactful
crashing against the vulnerable shoreline, cutting away at its support. Waves from this
boating activity have washed over docks that are usually dry. 
LD 693 is a solution that will keep large waves away from our fragile lake shorelines.
 ﻿
Please vote to support LD 693 to help preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank you.
Sincerely,
D. Broderick
Limerick, Lake Arrowhead.
