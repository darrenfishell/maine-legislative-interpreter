I would like to offer my strong support of LD 693.
As a part-time resident on the shoreline of Little Ossipee Lake in Waterboro, I see first-hand 
the ill effects of irresponsible wakeboarding. I see the increased exposure of shoreline plant 
root systems, the subtle changes in the shape of my property's shoreline, and the dangerous 
closeness between wakeboarding and swimmers as the boats pass through the Â±300' wide 
"narrows" near (our iconic) Three Tree Island. Note also that Three Tree Island no longer 
even HAS three trees; one tree succumbed to shoreline erosion.
I encourage the Legislature to pass this bill, in the hopes that the shoreline of Little Ossipee 
can be preserved for future generations.
Thank you.
