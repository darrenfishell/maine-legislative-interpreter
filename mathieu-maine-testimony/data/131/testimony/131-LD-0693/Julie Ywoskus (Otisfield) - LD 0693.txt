We are Julie and John Ywoskus and we live at 73 Saturday Pond Rd in Otisfield.  We are writing in 
support of LD693 to prohibit wake boats within 500’ of shore.  
Saturday Pond is a 188-acre pond with an average depth of 8 feet, a round shape with several narrow 
coves.  The only public access to Saturday Pond is Sam’s Landing where people can swim, fish, and carry 
kayaks and canoes in.  We have an active watershed association; we perform regular water tests, 
monitor the loons and other wildlife, and educate and patrol for invasive plants.   Usually, our water 
quality is good and we currently have no invasive plants.
There is a very large wake boat that visits our pond several times a summer.  When that boat is on the 
pond, it spends a lot of time pulling multiple skiers and tubers.  The waves that hit our shoreline are 
dramatically larger during this time even though our home is in one of the coves that is farthest away 
from where the boat is.  We cannot kayak or swim when this boat is on the pond because the waves are 
too large.  After these sessions, there are many more aquatic plants floating in the lake and much less 
water clarity. We worry that because of its ballast tank, the boat may bring in invasive plant life and 
infect our pond.  And all of this is from one wake boat that is here for several weeks in a year.  The 
effects would be worse if there were multiple wake boats or ones that were here all summer.
Clearly, wake boats are not appropriate for Saturday Pond.  LD693 would prohibit them from our pond 
because of its size and depth.  Although our residents are taking the action we can to discourage people 
from bringing boats like this onto the pond, we welcome the support of LD693, as it will prohibit them 
from ponds like ours.
Thank you for proposing this important bill to protect our lakes.
