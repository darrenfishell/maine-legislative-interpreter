Testimony in SUPPORT  of 
LD 693, “An Act  to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife, & Public Safety  
by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake  
Close to Shore  or in Shallow Water”  
 
Before the Committee on Inland Fisheries & Wildlife  
Presented by  Jayne Winters, South China, ME  
 
March 22, 2023  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representative  Landry , distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries & 
Wildlife  Committee, my name is Jayne Winters. I have  lived in Maine all my life and currently 
reside in South China, as well as maintain a summer home on Sebec Lake in Bowerbank . I am 
submitting comments in SUPPORT  of LD 693, “An Act  to Protect Inland Water Quality, 
Shorelines, Wildlife, & Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an 
Enhanced Wake Close to Shore or in Shallow Water .”  
 
In addition to having decades of family connection to Sebec Lake, one of the reasons my 
husband and I chose it as the location for our summer home is its excellent water quality. Over 
the years, we have come to appreciate even more the wildlife and birds, including the resident 
loons and eagles.  
 
Over the past 25 years, however, we’ve noticed a significant increase in boat traffic . Certainly 
not all, but some boaters seem to take pleasure in annoying  and unsafe practices, such as  
noise, litter, and general disregard for shorefront property, other boats, kayakers, and even 
swimmers.  
 
LD 693 would prohibit creating enhanced wake within 500’ of the shoreline or in  waters less 
than 20’ deep. In an effort to address the concerns noted above, passage of this bill would also 
protect loon nesting sites.  I respectfully urge you to pass LD 693 to help make Maine waters 
safer for their users and wildlife . Thank you  for you r consideration .
