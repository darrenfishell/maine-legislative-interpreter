Wake-surfing seems like a fun sport. As a water-skier, it would be something I’d be 
interested in trying were it not for the dangerous situations and wake it creates. Not 
only does this serve as a danger to our environment, but to boaters on the lake as well.
I know you are aware of the environmental impact of these wakes. I also assume you 
also understand just how big and dangerous these wakes are for other boaters, when 
we hit them, and for our docks. However, I’m not sure you have considered the 
danger these boat drivers pose.
To make these waves, not only is water often added to tanks in the back to make a 
larger wake, but the bow must ride very high. It must ride to its highest point, severely
obstructing the captain’s/driver’s view. I have had several instances where the driver 
COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS DIRECTLY INFRONT OF HIM and we had to 
take action to move, or we would be hit.
This, along with all the other issues these boats and wakes cause, should be why we 
need some sort of compromise. I understand enjoying the lake but this sport really 
poses some severe risks to the safety of those on the lake. 
Sincerely,
Lisa Roberts
