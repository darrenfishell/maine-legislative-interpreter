LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
Kimberly and David Hallee reside in Waterville and spend the summer on McGrath 
Pond. We are asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit 
large wake-generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ 
deep.  
We are concerned that large wakes close to shore will damage shorelines, and 
increase soil loss resulting in phosphorus increase, algae bloom,  economic loss, and 
social burden. As LakeSmart evaluators and McGrath Pond Salmon Lake board 
members, we educate the importance of stable shorelines and healthy robust buffers. 
We work with our lake members,7 Lakes Alliance, and the DEP  in addressing 
shoreline degradation. We support EPA 319 cost share grant usage per our 
Watershed-Based Management Plan towards that endeavor.    
We support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats 
on the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely because the care of our 
land, lakes, wildlife, and people must be in concert. We All have to Play Nice in the Water 
 and Keep the Splashing to a Minimum!!!
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,
