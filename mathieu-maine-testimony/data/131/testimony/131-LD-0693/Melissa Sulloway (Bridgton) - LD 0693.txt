Please honor and support this bill. My children and grandchildren are endangered by 
the large wakes that these wake boats produce. The children to whom I provide water 
activity are at risk of slamming into the rocks at our lakeside properties. It happens 
most everyday in the summer months. We all need to be considerate of each other so 
we can all enjoy and learn the lake experience. Also, our family has witnessed the 
devastation of erosion to the shorelines on both Highland Lake in Bridgton and 
Bunganut Lake in Lyman. Please help us preserve our lakes for future generations.
