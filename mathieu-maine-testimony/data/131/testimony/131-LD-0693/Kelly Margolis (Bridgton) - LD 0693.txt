LD 693
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
I am Kelly Margolis, President of the Woods Pond Association, the lake association 
for Woods Pond in Bridgton. I have owned a camp on Woods Pond since 2004. 
I support LD 693. This legislation will give wake boat operators clear guidance to 
help them reduce any harms to the lakes they love. These protections can help 
Maine’s waters and help wake boats operate safely. 
I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a common-sense solution that will 
keep large-wake-generating boats on the water but direct them to places where they 
can operate safely at a distance from shore and in deeper waters. Please vote to 
support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for everyone on 
Maine’s waters. 
Regards,
Kelly Margolis
Gorham and Bridgton
