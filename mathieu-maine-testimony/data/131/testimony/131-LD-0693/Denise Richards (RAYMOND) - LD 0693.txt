LD 693
I'm a full-time resident on Crescent Lake in Raymond, Maine. I also volunteer on my 
lake's watershed protection committee. I'm very happy to see legislation proposed for 
amending wake zones for the newer wake surf boats that are occasionally on our lake.
I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500' of shore and in water less than 20' deep.
Our lake has a narrow area in its center, so motorized boats impact the shoreline 
(erosion, dock undermining) more so than in larger parts of the lake. Moving these 
wave-producing boats further away from the shoreline can only improve the slowing 
down of erosion on our properties. In smaller lakes/ponds, this is even more crucial. 
There are enough natural causes for erosion; to control what we can is imperative. 
Also, non-motorized boaters (kayakers, canoeists) tend to be impacted by the large 
waves generated by these watercraft, as well.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a reasonable way to assure safe boating 
opportunities for everyone, especially as industry keeps providing more innovative 
ways to "play" on our lakes.
Thank you for an opportunity to comment on this important issue.
