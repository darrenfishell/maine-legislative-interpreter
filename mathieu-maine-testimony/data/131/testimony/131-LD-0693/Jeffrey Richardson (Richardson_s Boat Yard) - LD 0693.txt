LD 693
To all members.     As LD 693 is written I see it as hard to enforce with the 500 feet 
and 20 ft depth limits.The present 200 foot wake safety is working in our area and 
expanding it with out taking a closer view too see if there is a problem will not solve 
anything. Different lakes have different problems with shore line etc. I believe that  
LD 379 is the right approach to look at this issue and come up a solution that would 
work using both education and enforcement as the last resort.
