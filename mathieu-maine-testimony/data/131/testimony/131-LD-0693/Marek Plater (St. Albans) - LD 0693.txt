I am writing in support of Bill LD 693. I live on Big Indian Lake in St. Albans and am very 
concerned about Wake Boats. I conduct the annual Loon count and have already seen 
nesting areas threatened by boat wakes. Wake boats would increase such issues including 
sub-surface damage to our lake and others with similar low depth averages. Shoreline 
damage and damage to docks and moored boats would also be threatened by these 
increased wakes. I am sure this activity is fun for many surfing enthusiasts but perhaps they 
should take place on larger lakes where the higher wakes would dissipate before doing any 
damage.
I strongly agree with the proposed depth (20') and footage (500') restrictions and feel they will
protect our lake and others. Thank you.
