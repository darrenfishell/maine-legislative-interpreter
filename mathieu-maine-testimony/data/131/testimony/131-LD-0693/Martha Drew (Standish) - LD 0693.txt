LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
I live on Watchic Lake in Standish.  I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a 
bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in 
water less than 20’ deep.  
Over the past few years I have been very concerned about the large wakes from 
"wake boats" that have been eroding the shoreline of my property.  While I speak 
only for myself, I am a member of the Watchic Lake Association, which puts a huge 
amount of effort into protecting our fragile lake and its ecosystem and it's very 
discouraging to see all the hardwork we do to prevent runoff into the lake being 
cancelled out in a matter of minutes by these large wakes.  Alson of concern is the 
stirring up of sediment and release of phosphates on the lake bottom in shallow water,
caused by the engine thrust.  The association has received many requests for some 
sort of resolution to the problem, but to this point there has been no remedy.  
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Martha Drew
