LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Lindsay Taflas and spend the summer on Little Ossippee Lake. I am 
asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will destroy critical wildlife habitat, 
uproot trees, and contribute to the ongoing issue of erosion. Our beloved lake already 
has seen islands get smaller and smaller, and it's only a matter of time before they 
vanish away due to erosion. Additionally, our lake has seen a dramatic increase in 
boat traffic, including large wake generating boats. These boats are often not being 
driven safely, causing concerns for swimmers, paddlers and all who enjoy the lake. 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely because it makes sense for
both boaters, swimmers, paddlers, and for our wildlife. It's a win-win for all! 
 ﻿
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,  
Lindsay Taflas, Waterboro, Little Ossipee Lake
