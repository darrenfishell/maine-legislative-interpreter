Roy Lambert
Bridgton, Maine
LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Roy Lambert and I own property on Woods Pond in Bridgton, Maine.  I 
am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will erode the shoreline of affected 
lakes and ponds in Maine; damage docks; pose a risk to young children; interfere with
the enjoyment of Maine’s lakes by paddleboarders, kayakers, and swimmers; create 
havoc with nesting loons; and disturb the bottom sediments of shallow lakes and 
ponds, thereby adding to phosphorous loading. 
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely at a distance from shore 
and in deeper waters.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,  
Roy Lambert
