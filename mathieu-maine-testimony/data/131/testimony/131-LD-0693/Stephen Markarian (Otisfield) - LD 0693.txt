My name is Stephen Markarian and I am the water quality tester for Saturday Pond in 
Otisfield.  Saturday Pond is a shallow 188 acre pond with an average depth of 8 feet.  I have 
been trained and certified by the Lake Stewards of Maine.  
Two or three times each summer a wake boat is used on our pond.  I have observed water 
clarity drop notably.  The clarity sometimes takes weeks to improve.  By their nature, the 
wake disturbs the mud on the bottom of the lake ripping up native plants and putting the 
phosphorus in the mud back into solution.  After the wake boat has been on the pond, the 
water has vegetation floating everywhere.  Saturday Pond is fortunate not to have invasive 
plants at this time but if we did, the wake boat would be spreading them as it disturbs the 
bottom. Wake boats are inappropriate on small, shallow ponds.
                           Thank you, Stephen Markarian
