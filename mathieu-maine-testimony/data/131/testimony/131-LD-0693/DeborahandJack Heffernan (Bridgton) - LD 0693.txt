LD 693
Please, you must support Bill 693. For forty years we have lived on a peninsula in 
Highland Lake, Bridgton, and watched our shoreline erode rapidly in the past ten 
years due to the increased speed and recklessness of boats and jet skis. We are doing 
everything we can to preserve the shoreline, so essential to lake health. Lakes need 
your help in preventing the source of the problem. Please pass Bill 693.
