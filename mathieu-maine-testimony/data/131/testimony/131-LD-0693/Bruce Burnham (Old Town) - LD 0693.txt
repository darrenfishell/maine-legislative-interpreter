Greetings, members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, My name is Bruce Burnham, and I’m writing to ask you to carefully consider recommending LD693 to the full Legislature for passage.  I live in Old Town, and year round on Pushaw Lake - 8 miles long, and 1-1/4 miles across at it’s widest.  This bill would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep, and since Pushaw has an average depth of around 11 feet, such boats could potentially severely damage the environmental balance here.As a member and ofﬁcer of the Greater Pushaw Lake Association, our board has worked for a number of years to protect this lake.  These large wake boats operating too close to shorelines have the potential to damage everything from fragile natural banks, to the nests of waterbirds like loons and ducks that will be swamped, to making swimming and water play of younger children a bit more dangerous as they could be knocked off their feet unexpectedly, even to challenging the newer users of canoes, kayaks and rowing shells if they are caught unexpectedly while getting into or departing their craft, or operating them in shallower water.Our great state has a variety of lakes where these “wakesurf” boats can both be operated safely or others where they shouldn’t be used at all.  Even here on Pushaw there may be places where water depth and distance from shore would make them usable.  LD 693 can make it possible to allow these boats to be operated safely on a great number of lakes in Maine while educating their owners about the effects direct them to places where they can operate safely for both the environment and the others who recreate in the same waters . Thank you for considering my thoughts on this matter. Signed,  Bruce P Burnham107 Woodland Avenue, Old Town, Maine 04468, Pushaw Lake
