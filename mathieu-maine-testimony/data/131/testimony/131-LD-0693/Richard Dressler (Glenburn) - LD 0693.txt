Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
LD 693: An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife, and Public 
Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake 
Close to Shore or in Shallow Water
My name is Richard Dressler and I am writing in support of LD 693.  I am a resident of 
Glenburn and live year around on Pushaw Lake in Penobscot County.
This bill prohibits creating an enhanced wake with a boat that is equipped with wake-
enhancing equipment within 500 feet of the shoreline or in waters less than 20 feet 
deep.  This common-sense policy solution will: 
Reduce wake-caused erosion of fragile lake shorelines 
Keep lake water clean by reducing sediment disturbance in shallow water and 
close to shore
Protect lakeside and shallow habitat for nesting loons, fish and other species  
Assure safe waters close-to-shore for families, swimmers, and other boaters 
Reduce damage to personal property like docks and moored boats 
Keeps wake boat activities in deeper water where they perform the best.
Maine already has a 200’ “boater safety zone” which requires boats to travel at 
headway speed within 200’ of shore. That regulation was designed to protect water 
quality and fragile shorelines from large boat wakes. And it works for most boats on the 
Pushaw Lake today, including ski boats, bass boats and pontoon boats. But it doesn’t 
work for wake boats generating larger wakes than were possible at the time the law was 
established. And wakeboat technology is quickly advancing to bring us heavier boats 
generating up to 6' waves.
As Pushaw Lake is a large shallow lake with only two small holes over 20 feet 
deep, these boats should be prohibited on Pushaw Lake.
Please vote in support of LD 693 to protect our lakes, shorelines/docks, and provide 
safe boating for all lake users.
