To the members of the inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee:
My wife, Jill Rundle, and I are year-round residents on Kezar Lake. 
I am writing you to ask you to support LD693 that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500” of shore and in water less than 20’ deep. 
I am a director of the Kezar Lake Watershed Association and I hear complaints 
regularly from the shoreland owners regarding these large wake boats.  They are very 
numerous, vocal and angry complaints.  These large wave boats wash away the 
shoreline and they damage docks and boats with their incredibly large waves that are 
completely unnatural.  They are a major hazard to the shoreline and people’s property.
They also stir up phosphorous that can lead to algae blooms. 
This has been recognized as a major problem at lakes across the nation.  A simple 
solution to this problem is to require the boats to operate at a reasonable distance from
the shore so that the waves lessen in height to some degree so that they don’t do the 
incredible amount of damage that they currently cause.  
The state recognized that normal boats operating within 200’ should not make a wake.
It would seem that new action needs to be taken given that these large wake boats 
have created a condition that is damaging to the shoreline and property.  This 
proposed law is a reasonable solution that does not take away a person’s right to use 
the boats but does so in a manner that does not damage the property and rights of 
others.  
Please vote to support LD 693 to stop the damage to lake and property and to protect 
our lakes which are our most important tourist asset. 
Sincerely, 
Chris Brink and Jill Rundle, and the many people on Kezar Lake both homeowners and 
boaters that know there is a problem with these large wake boats.
