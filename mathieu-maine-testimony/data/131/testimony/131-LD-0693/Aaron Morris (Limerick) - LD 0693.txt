LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Aaron Morris and I own a home with over 500 ft of shoreline on Lake 
Arrowhead in Limerick, ME.  I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill 
that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in 
water less than 20’ deep.  
Lake Arrowhead is experiencing considerable shoreline erosion due to the large 
waves created by wake boats. The effects of the erosion are usually hidden from sight 
but are clearly visible when the water level is low. In places, up to six feet of soil has 
been removed from underneath the shoreland vegetation. Trees along the shoreline 
can be seen leaning towards the water and eventually fall in as the substrate below is 
removed by boat wake. Boat wake is actually killing trees and contributes to higher 
levels of siltation.
The wake generated by wake boats on Lake Arrowhead produces waves that are so 
large they actually break, and crash onto the shoreline and sometimes even wash right
over docks.
LD 693 is a solution that will keep these large manmade waves away from our fragile lake 
shorelines.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 to help preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank you.
Signed,
