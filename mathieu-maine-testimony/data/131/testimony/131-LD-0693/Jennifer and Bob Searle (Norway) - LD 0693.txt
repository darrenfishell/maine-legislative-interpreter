LD 693
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
We are Bob and Jennifer Searle. We enjoy our home on Sand Pond in Norway where 
we love the sparkle of the ice in winter and spend hours swimming, kayaking, SUPing
and listening to the calls of the loons during all of the months when the pond's water 
isn't frozen!
We have read carefully about and are asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill 
that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in 
water less than 20’ deep.  
We are concerned that large wakes close to shore will damage delicate plant life along
the shore, disturb the wildlife that builds its nests (the loons!) and makes its home 
along the shore (the resident mink!) and pose a safety risk for children as well as 
those among us who aren't strong swimmers. 
We support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating
boats on appropriate waters but direct them to places where they can operate safely 
while maintaining the value of our beautiful water bodies.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Bob and Jennifer Searle
