Sharon Lockwood
Sokokis Lake Limerick, Maine
LD 693
My name is Sharon Cloutman Lockwood. My parents bought a cottage on Lake Sokokis in 
Limerick in 1955. I am the present owner. I am a member of the Sokokis Lake  Association.  I 
support LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500 feet of 
shore and in water less than 20 feet deep.
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will potentially, hurt swimmers and damage 
tethered boats and docks. There is concern about shoreline erosion and increased sediment 
disturbance from the lake bottom. We already have a problem with mud islands. I think that 
wildlife nests and fish are also at risk.
I hope that large wake generating boats will be directed to water where they can operate 
safely. Please vote to support LD693 as a way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.
Respectfully submitted
