LD 693
Dear Legislator,
I am writing to ask that you support the bill LD 693 to prevent wake surfing within 500 ft. of the
shoreline on our beautiful lakes in Maine.  I have a home on Long Lake in Harrison.  The lake 
is 11 miles long and one mile wide.  There is already a problem with boats speeding down the
lake because of its runway shape.  Due to the narrow shape of the lake, wake surfing boats 
can have a substantial impact upon the shoreline and all that results from that.  Please 
support this important bill.
Sincerely,
Cheryl Robertson
