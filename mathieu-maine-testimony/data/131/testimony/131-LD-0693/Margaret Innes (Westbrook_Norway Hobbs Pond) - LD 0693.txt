Westbrook/Norway Hobbs Pond
LD 693
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Margaret Innes. I am a home-owner on a small lake in Norway, Maine – 
Hobbs Pond (aka Little Pennesseewassee) in Norway, Maine. I write to you today in 
support of LD 693 – AN Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife 
and Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create and Enhanced 
Wake Close to Shore or in Shallow Water. My family has owned this home since 
1968.
This bill is a rare instance of creating a true win-win situation for shoreland property 
Owners as well as motor boat sports-people. I am very concerned about the risks that 
the wake board boats pose to churning up toxins at the bottoms of lakes when they are
operating a full capacity in less than 20-foot depths. We at Hobbs Pond have been 
dealing with some nasty algae for the past 2 years. It is extremely unpleasant. I do not 
want others to have to go through this. By placing the motor boats further out in a 
lake it can prevent this from happening while still allowing the wakeboarders the 
enjoyment of their sport. Additionally, it keep high-speed boats away from the 
shoreline where our younger family members spend most of their time.
Please vote in support of LD 693. 
Margaret Innes, Westbrook, Maine (Hobbs Pond, Norway)
