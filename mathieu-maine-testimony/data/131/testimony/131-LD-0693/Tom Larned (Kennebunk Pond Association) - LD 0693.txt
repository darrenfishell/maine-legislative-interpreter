LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
As president of the Kennebunk Pond Association, I'm representing 147 shorefront 
property owners, asking for your support for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large 
wake-generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will_____________(share your greatest 
concern, such as damage your docks, flood your boats, pose a risk to young children, etc.) 
I've seen how much fun one may have surfing the monster wakes created behind wake
boats, having done that on Coeur d'Alene Lake in northern Idaho.     But, allowing 
those boats to create monster wakes on our little Kennebunk Pond would be crazy!  
Our membership has worked relentlessly for the past twenty years to reduce soil 
erosion into the pond, succeeding in getting Kennebunk Pond removed from the most 
threatened waterbodies list in Maine.  We'd hate to see all that work "go down the 
drain", so to speak, with monster wakes creating a monstrous shoreline erosion 
problem.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,  Tom Larned, Kennebunk Pond Association
