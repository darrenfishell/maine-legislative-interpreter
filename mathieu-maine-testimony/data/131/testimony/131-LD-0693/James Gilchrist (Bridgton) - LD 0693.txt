Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to 
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
 
My wife and I own a camp on Moose Pond in Bridgton for over 25 years. Our names are 
James Gilchrist and Maria DelBeccaro. We can be reached thru my email at 
jamesgilchrist07@gmail.com.  Preserving the beauty, clear water and native flora and fauna 
of Moose Pond, and all Maine lakes, is very important to us.  We have had first hand 
experience of how large wakes from boats too close to shore can affect shoreline, loons, 
ducks and those of us who also enjoy non-powered lake activities such as swimming, 
canoeing and kayaking.  The noise of crashing waves as they smash into the shore is all too 
familiar, from boats way to close to shore.  We fully support your bill to mitigate this 
problem to whatever extent it can by keeping wake boats farther from shore.  We and our 
neighbors also worry about invasive plants such as milfoil, and the adverse effect of large 
wakes on keeping any infestation under even partial control. The lakes of Maine are one of 
its many treasures, and they need more protection.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
 
Jim Gilchrist
Maria DelBeccaro
