Dear Members of the legislature,  Please support LD 693!   This is a common sense law to address the large wakes that Wake Boats cause. Peer reviewed studies have shown these wakes require a minimum of 500 feet to dissipate.  Even at that distance the effects to shoreline erosion, personal property and loon nests are significant.  I live on Echo Lake (Mt Vernon) and can personally speak to the impact.  With two summer camps (Camp Laurel and Vega) that deploy Wake Boats I have personally experienced the impact.  Through the Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) with the assistance of the 30 Mile River Watershed Association I have ripped rapped my shoreline multiple times.  These actions help but are only a temporary buttress.  And this only protects the shoreline where this action is taken.  Please support LD 693 to keep up with this new technology.  Thank you!  Eric Johnson Echo Lake/Mt Vernon
