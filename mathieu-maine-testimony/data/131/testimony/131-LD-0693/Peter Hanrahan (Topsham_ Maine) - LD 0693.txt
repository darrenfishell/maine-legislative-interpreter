Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee:
Greetings.  I am a coastal consultant, based in Topsham, Maine, and seen firsthand the 
damage caused by wave action on our lakes and ponds. I am asking for your support 
today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ 
of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
The impact of such erosion is usually hidden from sight but is clearly visible when the 
water level is low. I have visited sites where up to six feet of soil has been removed from 
underneath the vegetation at the shoreline. Trees along the shoreline can be seen 
leaning towards the water and eventually fall in as the substrate below is removed by 
boat wake. Boat wake is actually killing trees and contributes to higher levels of siltation 
of our water bodies.
LD 693 is a solution that will keep large waves away from our fragile lake shorelines.
﻿ 
Please vote to support LD 693 to help preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank 
you.
Sincerely,
Peter M. Hanrahan, CPESC
