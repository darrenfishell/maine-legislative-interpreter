Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
LD 693:  An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife, and Public Safety by Prohibiting 
Operation of A Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to Shore or in Shallow Water
Hello, my name is Scott Cunningham and I am writing to oppose LD 693 as a full time, year-round 
resident of 44 years on Pushaw Lake in Penobscot County.  
First, it's important to recognize that wake boats are a popular and valuable form of recreation for many 
people, particularly those who enjoy water sports like wakeboarding and waterskiing. Banning wake 
boats would deprive these individuals of a cherished pastime and limit their ability to enjoy their time on 
the water.
Furthermore, it's worth considering that wake boats can have a positive economic impact on local 
communities. Wake boats are often used in conjunction with other water-based activities like fishing, 
swimming, and boating, which can attract tourism and generate revenue for local businesses. Banning 
wake boats could have a detrimental effect on these industries, hurting the economy and the livelihoods 
of those who rely on them.  Furthermore, I know people that would consider moving out of the area if 
their lake became one that banned the ability to participate in their sport.
Additionally, it's important to consider that there are many factors that can impact wildlife in these 
lakes, including pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction.  Many wake boat manufacturers have 
made significant advancements in technology and design to minimize the environmental impact of these 
vessels. Additionally, many wake boat enthusiasts are responsible boaters who follow safety guidelines 
and respect other boaters and natural habitats.
In fact, some wake boats are designed with features that can actually reduce their impact on erosion. 
For example, some models are equipped with ballast systems that distribute weight evenly across the 
boat, which can help to reduce the size and intensity of the wake. Additionally, some boats are designed 
with hull shapes that can redirect the flow of water and minimize turbulence, which can further reduce 
the impact on erosion.
Rather than banning wake boats outright, it may be more appropriate to establish regulations and 
guidelines to ensure their safe and responsible use. For example, enforcing speed limits, designated no 
wake zones, and educational programs for proper boat handling and safety could mitigate any negative 
impact while still allowing for the enjoyment of wake boats.  Overall, wake boats are designed with 
safety in mind, and many include features specifically intended to enhance the safety of riders and other 
boaters on the water, including slower surfing speeds than a typical boat, and the ability to manually 
adjust speed and wave for the purpose of safety for all.  Furthermore, wake boats typically have more 
safety features than other boats, including larger mirrors, and propellors being out of reach.  
Perhaps the best explanation of this can be described using mathematics.  In response to the 
complaint regarding large waves generated by wake boats, here is the math.  Assuming that the boat 
maintains the same speed and trajectory, the size of the wake generated by a boat 500 feet away 
from shore in 15 feet of water would likely be significantly smaller than the original 5-foot wake.
The size of a wake decreases as it moves away from the boat due to friction and the dispersion of 
energy into the surrounding water.  It is mathematically safe to say that the wake at 500 feet would 
likely be much smaller than 5 feet in height when reaching shore.  In general, the size of the wake 
would likely decrease by about 50% every time the distance from the boat doubles. So, at 500 feet 
away, the wake would likely be around 1.25 feet (15 inches) or less in height when reaching shore.  
In summary, a bill banning the use of wake boats on lakes could have unintended consequences on the 
economy, recreation, and the rights of individuals to engage in a beloved activity and the claims of its 
destruction are simply not based in fact.

In Summary:
Wake boats are a popular and valuable form of recreation for many people
Mathematically, the size of the wake greatly decreases by the time it reaches shore
Many wake boat manufacturers have made significant advancements in technology and design 
to minimize the environmental impact of these boats
Wake boat enthusiasts are responsible boaters who follow safety guidelines and respect other 
boaters and natural habitats
