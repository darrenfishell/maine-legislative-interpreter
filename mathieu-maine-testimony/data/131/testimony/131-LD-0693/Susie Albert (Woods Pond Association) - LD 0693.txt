LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Susie Albert and I live in Boston, MA and spend the summer in and boat 
on Woods Pond. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would 
prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 
20’ deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will both pose a risk to young children 
and to bank erosion.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,  
Susie Albert, Woods Pond seasonal camp owner, Bridgton, Maine
