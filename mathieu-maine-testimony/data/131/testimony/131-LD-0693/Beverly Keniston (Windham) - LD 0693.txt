Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
 
I’m Beverly Keniston and live on the south end of Little Sebago Lake.  I can be reached via 
phone at 207-894-2008.  I live here year round and enjoy boating, fishing and swimming here 
at the lake.  Love the beauty of the lake and of the wildlife here as well.  I am actively involved
in our loon protection group.   
 One of the issues with the wake boarding is the hazard it presents to our loon 
population.  During breeding season the wakes from the boats create waves that flood 
the fragile nests of the loons which are at lakes edge.  The closer to shore the boats are
allowed to come the more severe the waves and the flooding.  This flooding causes 
the eggs to roll out of the nest and into the water, usually causing cracking and then 
death of the contents of the egg…a future loon.  
I totally support this bill because not only will it preserve the shoreline itself but it 
also will protect the needed vegetation growing on the bottom of the lake that is 
necessary to support our fish, birds and other critters.   As above I also support this 
bill because in protecting our shorelines it protects our loon population.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
 
Beverly Keniston
