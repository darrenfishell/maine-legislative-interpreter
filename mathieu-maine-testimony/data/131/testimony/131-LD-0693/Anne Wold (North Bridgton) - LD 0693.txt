Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
 
My name is Anne Wold and I live on Long Lake in North Bridgton. I started attending Camp 
Newfound in 1948 and moved here in 1990.  To make this short and and concise, I am very 
disappointed to have so many boats whose operators have no ideas of their boats and the 
damage they have done and are doing to my favorite lake.  I have even found that local camp
owners and their counselors have no idea how destructive wake boats are to the lakes we all 
love in Maine.
You and your committee should do Maine Lakes a huge service by passing LD693 to 
help prevent the damage these boats are doing by eroding the shoreline so that my 
great grandchildren, who are already attending Camp Newfound and Camp Owatonna
can enjoy this lake and others as I did. . 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
 
Anne Wold
