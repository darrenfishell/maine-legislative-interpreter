LD 693
My name is Linus Schultz and I live in Limerick, ME on Lake Arrowhead. I am 
asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake 
generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.
Large wakes cause significant erosion on the shores of our lake. In addition to killing 
trees that grow along the shoreline and creating dangerous sinkholes, this erosion is 
gradually shrinking the size of everyone's property!
The environment, our safety, and our financial well-being will all benefit from this 
bill.
Please vote to support LD 693 to help preserve the shorelines of Maine’s lakes. Thank
you.
Signed,
