Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator Keim, Representative Millet, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
My name is Mary Ann Holme (maryann_holme@yahoo.com) . My husband Ray and 
I live in Waterford. We love the lakes and waters and natural beauty  , all of which 
nurture and feed the wildlife which makes Maine so unique and beautiful.  Our family
enjoys boating and swimming  and skiing on the local lakes. 
Excessive wakes are detrimental to others who enjoy the lakes for alternative 
recreation, as well as harming the wildlife that live in the shallows. 
This bill simply regulates the usage of wake boats, attempting to limit damage for 
other activities  on our lakes and basically protecting the water quality and wildlife.
We urge you to support this important bill to protect our waters for all to use and enjoy for 
generations to come.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
 
Mary Ann and Ray Holme
