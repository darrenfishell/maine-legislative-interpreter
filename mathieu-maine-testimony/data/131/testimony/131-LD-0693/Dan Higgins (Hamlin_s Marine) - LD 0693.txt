I oppose a bill that would further restrict the use of wake/surf category watercraft on 
Maine lakes. These boats are no different than other categories of watercraft when 
surf/wake technology is not activated.  Dangerous, damaging, and irresponsible 
operation of the of these boats is the sole responsibility of the operator.  Small lakes 
and ponds simply won't accommodate this category of watercraft because of their 
design characteristics and draft.  Wake/Surf sports are widely enjoyed in Maine, and 
there is a cottage industry of training young athletes at long-established summer 
camps in Maine that attract campers from all over the world.  As principal of Hamlin's
Marine, a dealer of Mastecraft boats, our annual sales of  Wake/Surf category boats is 
approximately $1 million annually.  I estimate that we have 10% of the market in 
Maine, so I believe the sale of these boats exceed $10 M per year on a state-wide 
basis.
