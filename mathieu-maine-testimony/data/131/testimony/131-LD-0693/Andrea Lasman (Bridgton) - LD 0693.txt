LD 693
Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
My name is Andrea Lasman.  I live on Woods Pond in Bridgton, Maine.  I am asking 
for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake generating 
boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
Woods Pond is a narrow, relatively shallow water body.  I’ve seen firsthand the significant 
damage that wake boats are causing to our shoreline—erosion, and dislodging of rock buffers
that have been in place for more than a century. Waves produced by these boats are 
dangerous to swimmers and kayakers.  A neighbor sustained injuries last summer while 
swimming, when large waves pushed her into rocks at her shoreline. Waves are high enough 
to crash over our dock, which is normally between 12 to 18 inches above the water level.
I’m not only concerned about the obvious damage that these boats are causing to property, 
but about the disruption and damage to the lake ecosystem in a shallow lake such as 
ours—churning up the water, ripping up plants and destroying habitat.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely, such as to larger, deeper, 
wider bodies of water where their impact would be less dangerous.
 
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Sincerely,
Andrea Lasman
