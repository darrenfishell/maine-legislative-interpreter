LD 693
My name is Kay Johnson and I serve as president of Friends of Wilson Pond Area, Inc., a 
Maine Land Trust.  I live on Wilson Pond in Greenville, Maine and boat on Lower Wilson 
Pond and Moosehead Lake. I am asking for your support today for LD 693, a bill that would 
prohibit large wake generating boats from within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ 
deep.  
I am concerned that large wakes close to shore will cause shoreline erosion contributing to 
the decline of water quality, negatively impact nesting loons and ducks, and create and make 
the shore unsafe for children to enjoy. Also the danger of damage to grandfathered boat 
houses and cabins who are close to the shore.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will keep large-wake-generating boats on 
the water but direct them to places where they can operate safely.
 ﻿
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for 
everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill. 
Signed,
