Dear Legislators, As someone who enjoys Maine's woods and waters and who  a 
amall camp property on Spec Pond in Amherst and I am very much in support of this 
bill. Wake boats accelerate shoreline erosion, increase lake sediments, and potentially 
harm water nesting birds, particularly loons. They are also loud and are frequently 
operated without due regard to other lake users such as paddlers, sailors, anglers and 
swimmers. Wakeboats differ from water ski and tubing boats because the addition of 
wake gear intentionally creates waves at surface and subsurface levels that have a far 
greater impact on the lacustrine environment than regular boats operating on a plane. 
At the low end of the market wake boats cost around $50,000 and it is not uncommon 
for wake boats to cost over $150,000 each, so I can see why wake boarders and wake 
boaters wouldn't want to limit the opportunity to use their expensive toys, however 
recreational opportunities enjoyed by a few should not be allowed to degrade the 
environment or limit the enjoyment of Maine's public waterways by all.
I think it is also important to remember that Maine's great ponds and lakes belong to 
all Mainers equally and that having waterfront property does not give the owner a 
greater voice in the management of those public resources than would be enjoyed by 
any other citizen.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments.
