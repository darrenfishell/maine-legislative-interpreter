 Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,  
 My name is T ristan T aber and I am a resident of Bangor , ME. I am asking that you  
 support LD 693, a bill that would prohibit the use of large-wake-generating boats and  
 wake-inducing equipment within 500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ depth.  
 I am an aquatic ecologist concerned about the impact wakes along the shore have on  
 shoreland sediment structure, macroinvertebrate community , and erosion of near-shore  
 soil. 
 I am urging you to support LD 693 as a common-sense solution. Many lake residents  
 and boaters cannot ensure that headway speed and proximity to the shore is not  
 causing a wake that disturbs the shoreland. Large-wake-generating boats exacerbate  
 this issue and can cause overtopping of the shore meaning erosion of phosphorus rich  
 topsoils, which in-turn negatively impact the lake waters through eutrophication - the  
 accelerated nutrient enrichment of a lake, leading to cyanobacteria blooms.  
 Wake-boats and large-wake-generating aftermarket equipment can provide people with  
 an enjoyable outdoor activity , but it needs to be used in conditions that will not  
 negatively impact lake health.  
 Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for  
 everyone on our publicly owned Great Ponds.  
 Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.  
 Most respectfully , 
 Tristan T aber 
 Aquatic Scientist
