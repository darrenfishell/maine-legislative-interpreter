Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to 
Shore or in Shallow Water "
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
My name is Deb Gellerson and I reside at 1 Brads Way in Gray, Maine.  I have lived on Little 
Sebago Lake since 1980.  In that 43 years,  I have seen many concerning changes on the lake 
regarding lake quality and safety.  The most important safety issue I feel on our lake is the 
wake board boats that are creating large wakes while also churning up the water below the 
surface.
I am fortunate enough to have a beach that I have always maintained myself.  The last 
couple of years the debris that is on the beach every day has increased 4 fold.  There is no 
question that the increased boat traffic is a issue, but, these wake board boats are churning 
up the bottom of our shallow lake.  Our swimming area is littered with debris which is 
floating into the shoreline constantly.  It's becoming impossible to maintain and becoming 
unswimmable.
Further, I was swamped twice last summer due to the huge wake these boats make.  Once 
in my 10' kayak with my granddaughter and once while out paddle boarding.   And, on both 
occurrences we were less than 100' off shore.  I rescued 2 young people in sailboats last 
summer who were completely swamped; again from the wake of these boats.
This is a real public safety issue and I appreciate your consideration to try to get this under 
control. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693.
