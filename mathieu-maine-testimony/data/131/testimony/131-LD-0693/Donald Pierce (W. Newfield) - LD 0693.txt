Greetings -  Three reasons why I support this bill:
 - Shoreline erosion
 -Personal property damage
 - Quality of life issues
Shoreline erosion has advanced since the since the arrival of wake boats.   Sections of 
our lake have lost up to two feet of shoreline as a result of the large wakes/waves.  
Two years ago my lost lost a three by four foot section of shoreline retaining wall as a
result of the wakes.
I have had physical damage to my boats and dock to include cleats being ripped of of 
my dock while the boats are parked there as well as well as having a cleat being 
ripped of a parked boat.
Quality of life issues are important as well.  Having to sure that small children are out 
of the water when the wakes come ashore.  Having to stand up or leave the dock 
because the waves can swamp the dock and/or cause water to come up through it.  
Other sports such as skiing, kayaking, canoeing, and paddle boating cannot be safely 
done when the wake boats are active.
Thank you for addressing this important issue
