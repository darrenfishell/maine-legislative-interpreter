LD 693
Dear members of the inland fisheries and wildlife committee, My name is Dr. Barry 
Kutzen and I have lived on Middle Range Pond in Poland Spring for the past 50 
years. I have been the lake monitor, collecting lake data for the past 35 years, so I 
consider myself an experienced observer of lake conditions. I support LD 693 limiting
wake boats ability to further degrade our fragile lake. Range pond is a small pond of 
392 acres with a mean depth of 29 feet. Last summer for the first time in my 35 years 
of monitoring the lake had an algae bloom. Coincidentally to this was the presence for
the first time of 2 wake boats from a summer camp that circled the lake continuously 
for 6 hours a day every day. I observed the continuous pounding of the shoreline with 
subsequent erosion and excess runoff of nutrients and phosphorous, all detrimental to 
the health of the lake. There are many causes of algae blooms but I can't help to think 
that this added burden helped to produce this. Furthermore the large wakes preclude 
stand up paddle boarders, and kayakers from safely using the lake. I personally had to 
go out to rescue a family of three whose canoe was capsized by the large wake of one 
of these boats. Although I personally think these boats have no place on a small b 
body of water, at least you need to regulate their use to prevent as little disruption and
damage as possible.
