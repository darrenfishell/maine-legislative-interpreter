Re: Support for LD 693: "An Act to Protect Inland Water Quality, Shorelines, Wildlife and 
Public Safety by Prohibiting Operation of a Wake Boat to Create an Enhanced Wake Close to
Shore or in Shallow Water "
 
Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
My name is Wendy Molin, wendymolin@gmail.com, and I spend five to six months 
per year at my home on Kezar Lake. I am asking for your support for LD693, the bill 
that poses sensible restrictions for wake boats. Prohibiting the use of wake boats 
within 500 feet of shore and in less than 20 feet water is reasonable. 
Wakes created closer to shore than 500 feet create waves that can hasten erosion of 
the shoreline, disturb loon nesting areas, pose danger to small children and pets, and 
disturb kayakers and canoers. Wake boats operating in less than 20 feet of water can 
stir up the lake bottom, disturbing aquatic life and potentially causing algae blooms as
phosphorous is displaced and redistributed. This danger really scares me: I know 
everyone will be saddened if rules are not put in place before an irreversible problem 
starts. 
Please vote for LD693. We all deserve to share the beauty and enjoy the beautiful lakes in 
Maine. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on 
LD 693. 
Sincerely, 
Wendy Molin
