Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee:
My name is Susan LaFleur. During the spring and summer months, my husband, Dave and I 
live at our camp on Saturday Pond in Otisfield, which we have owned since 2010. 
Saturday Pond is a gem of a pond! It has an area of 179 acres and has a depth of 25 feet at 
its deepest point, but the majority depth areas are less than 10 feet. 
For the past two summers, we have had serious concerns about wake boats on our pond. 
These boats cause waves/wakes that have been dangerous to swimmers, kayakers, 
canoeists and paddleboarders. In addition, we are very worried about the safety of the two 
loons that reside on our pond. 
I am a certified LSM Invasive Plant patroller, and I am very concerned about the possibility 
that wake boats coming onto our Pond could be carrying parts of non-native, invasive plants 
from other water bodies in their ballast tanks. Even a minute portion could grow to 
contaminate our Pond.  At the present time, Saturday Pond has no invasive plant species and
I would certainly like to keep it that way. 
After a wake boat has been on our pond, there has been a marked erosion of banks, large 
amounts of plants floating on the water caused by damage to the pond bottom, and greatly 
diminished water clarity. 
I hope you will consider my comments on LD 693 and vote to support the protection of Maine 
waters. 
Thank you, 
Susan LaFleur
