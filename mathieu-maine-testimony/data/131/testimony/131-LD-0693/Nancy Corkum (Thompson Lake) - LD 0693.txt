Nancy Corkum
Thompson Lake
LD 693
I, Nancy Corkum of 22 Fairturn Acres in Oxford Maine and regular boater on 
Thompson Lake, support enactment of LD693.  We need regulations in order to allow
Wake Boating in a safe manner without causing more erosion of our shorelines and 
for the safety of our wildlife.
