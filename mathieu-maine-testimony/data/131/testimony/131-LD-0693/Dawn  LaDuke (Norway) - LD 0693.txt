We are incredibly blessed to live on Lake Pennesseewassee in Norway, Maine.  The sole 
detractor to this bucolic environment is the growing presence of wake boats that have caused
significant shoreline erosion and damage to both our dock and boat.  Being conscientious 
environmental stewards of Lake Norway's health, we have restored our shoreline with native 
plants to help prevent erosion but know with the ever increasing presence of wake boats this 
measure will need to be repeated often.  There are times when we have left our large dock for
safety reasons as the enormous waves make their way to shore to result in significant and 
dangerous rocking and shifting and dock legs needing to be readjusted.
