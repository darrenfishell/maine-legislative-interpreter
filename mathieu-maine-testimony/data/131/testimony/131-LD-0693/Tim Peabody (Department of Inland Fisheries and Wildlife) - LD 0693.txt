DATE OF HEARING: March 22, Z023 
Good afternoon Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife Committee. I am Tim Peabody, Deputy Commissioner of the Department 
of lnland Fisheries and Wildlife, speaking on behalf of the Department, in opposition to L.D. 693. 
This bill prohibits creating an enhanced wake with a boat that is equipped with wake-enhancing 
equipment within 500 feet of the shoreline or in waters less than 20 feet deep. 
The shoreline setback and minimum water depth operating provisions outlined in this bill will 
require the ability to ascertain 500 feet from the shore and determine where water is greater 
than 20 feet deep. As stated in related testimony the Department feels we should look at some 
of the regional and national information on this topic which would include an analysis of the 
operation of wake boats along with environmental and enforcement concerns before we discuss 
any regulatory action for the state of Maine. 
Interest in wake boats is more recent and they appear to be relatively uncommon in Maine, and 
for those who enjoy boating we also know some watercraft are inherently better suited to 
larger, deeper lakes and ponds where existing waves are greater, where water depths are 
deeper, and there is more separation of users. The time to manage any relevant concerns of 
wake boating is now (or the second session of this legislature) before they become well 
established and more widespread. 
I would be glad to answer any questions at this time or during the work session.
