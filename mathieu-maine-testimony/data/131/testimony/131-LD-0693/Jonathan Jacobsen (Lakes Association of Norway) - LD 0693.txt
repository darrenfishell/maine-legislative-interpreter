Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Jonathan Jacobsen. My wife and I spend the summer on Lake Pennesseewassee in
Norway in a camp enjoyed by four generations of our family, so far. I am asking for your
support today for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large wake generating boats from within
500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.
In just the past few years we have noticed a significant increase in the erosion along our
waterfront, which correlates with the increased use of large wake generating boats. Our camp
is on the ‘narrows’ of Lake Penn that connect the two larger areas of the lake. It is about 600’
from our shore to the adjacent islands. Any large wake generating boat traversing the narrows
creates big waves that wash phosphorous laden soil into the lake, shake the docks, rock the
boats, and have the potential to knock over young children in the shallow water.
Passage of LD 693 will keep large-wake-generating boats on the water but direct them to
operate in places where they can operate safely – such as the large areas of open water on Lake
Penn – and away from narrow bodies of water where the impact of large wakes is unavoidable.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for everyone
on our publicly owned Great Ponds.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Signed,
Jonathan A. Jacobsen, 27 Rifuma Way, Norway, ME 04268 (June-September)
