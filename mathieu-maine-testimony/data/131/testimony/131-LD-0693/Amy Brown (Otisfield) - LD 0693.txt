Good afternoon, my name is Amy Brown, my husband William Young 
and I have a home on Saturday Pond in Otisfield. lam on the Board of 
Directors for Saturday Pond Watershed Association and a Certified 
Invasive Plant Patrol Person. At this point you have heard and read all 
about the dangers Wake Boats cause to Ponds and small lakes, l don't 
wish to lecture you any further. lts common sense really. 
I wish to speak to you as a grandmother of six that learned to swim 
from our dock on Saturday Pond. We got them to accept that we share 
the pond with snapping turtles, watersnakes, dock spiders (this big), 
and the occasional mink or otter. We've taught them to respect the 
pond wildlife, especially the loons. Yet the one thing that will keep my 
grandchildren out of the water is when the Wake boat is out there. 
They are unable to kayak or paddle board or even stand up with the 
large waves it creates. They refuse to jump into the water from our 
dock as the ell in our dock is filled with plant life and mud dug up from 
the bottom of the lake from the Wake boat. They prefer to see what 
lurks below. 
Saturday Pond is the epitomy of what this Bill represents. The damage 
to the berm of our lakes, the plant life on the bottom of the lake, the 
destruction of loons nests, are all direct results of these types of boats. 
Please pass this Bill. Thank you.A
