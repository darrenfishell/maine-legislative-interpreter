Dear members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Jim O’Brien and I own an island and camp on Lake Pennesseewassee in Norway.  I am asking 
today for your support for LD 693, a bill that would prohibit large-wake-generating boats from within 
500’ of shore and in water less than 20’ deep.  
In 2019 I helped to coordinate a survey of the 10,000-acre Lake Pennesseewassee watershed in order to 
identify sources of erosion that could result in sediment and phosphorus getting into the lake, which in 
turn would lead to increased algae growth.  For the past last two years, I have been involved in 
implementation of the Lake Pennesseewassee Watershed Protection Plan that was approved by the 
Maine DEP in 2020 to reduce erosion and protect the lake’s water quality.
Our lakes are fragile ecological and economic resources that should be enjoyed but also protected.  
Large-wake-generating boats have been on Lake Pennesseewassee for the last couple of years and I 
have seen the impact that their wakes have on the shoreline.  The increased size and force of these 
wakes have been shown to increase the rate of erosion.
I support LD 693 as a common-sense solution that will allow large-wake-generating boats to use many 
Maine lakes but will direct them to places where they can operate with less damage to the shoreline.
Please vote to support LD 693 as a smart way to assure safe boating opportunities for everyone on our 
publicly owned Great Ponds while also protecting these ecosystems for future use.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Respectfully,
Jim O’Brien
