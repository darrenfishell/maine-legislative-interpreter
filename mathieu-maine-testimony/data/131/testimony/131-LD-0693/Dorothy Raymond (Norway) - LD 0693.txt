LD 693
Greetings- We are residents of Norway, Maine and live on North Pond, a small, 
relatively shallow and delicate pond. We are already experiencing erosion from waves
generated by boats that disregard the 200 foot rule. Enhanced wake would be 
devastating.
We are in support of LD 693 and its intention to protect our lake and pond shorelines, 
docks. other boaters, and even our children swimming from enhanced wakes and the 
boats that create them. 
Thank you for your consideration,
Harold F Buote Jr
