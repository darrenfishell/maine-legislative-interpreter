Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, distinguished members of the 
joint standing committee on taxation, I am Representative Joshua Morris and I have the 
honor of representing the people of Turner, Leeds, and Wayne. I am here today to present 
LD 708, An Act to Establish a Sales Tax Holiday Weekend. 
Currently, Maine people are dealing with the highest inï¬‚ation in 40 years. Prices 
for gas and groceries have spiked in the last year. Establishing a sales tax holiday 
weekend will provide some relief to Maine people at a time when they need it most. 
LD 708 would establish a sales tax holiday annually in August. I believe this 
weekend would work best as it would allow families to shop for back-to-school supplies. 
It would also allow people to start on their Christmas shopping four months early. 
This also will help Maine businesses that are still recovering from the lingering 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the competition they face from neighboring 
states. As this committee is aware, the state of New Hampshire does not have a sales tax. 
Even Massachusetts has established an annual sales tax holiday. 
I would also like to offer a couple changes to the bill as written. Past proposals 
have exempted large ticket items as well as tobacco products. I would welcome an 
amendment to this bill with the same exemptions. 
I would also welcome an amendment to allow for a sales tax exemption on meals 
and lodging for that Weekend. Restaurants and hotels were negatively impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic as well. 
I thank the committee for its consideration, and I would be happy to take any 
questions. 
District 91 Leeds, Turner & Wayne
