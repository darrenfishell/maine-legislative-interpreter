Hello. My name is Craig Gorris and I write in my capacity as General Manager of  
The Maine Mall in South Portland, ME. I strongly support the concept of a sales tax 
holiday in Maine,  particularly if the tax holiday is timed to coincide with a period of 
elevated spending like back-to-school. Shopping for back-to-school items is a 
necessity in most households, so a tax holiday during this time would be especially 
beneficial to lower income shoppers since their purchases consist of a higher share of 
their overall household spend. Moreover, our national retailer partners have told us 
that sales-tax holidays in other states are accretive to their overall sales as opposed to 
adjusting the timing of the spend during the month. Finally, Maineâ€™s only border 
state, New Hampshire, offers tax free shopping during the entire year and there are 
numerous studies and anecdotal evidence regarding the loss of sales in Maine to our 
neighbor.
