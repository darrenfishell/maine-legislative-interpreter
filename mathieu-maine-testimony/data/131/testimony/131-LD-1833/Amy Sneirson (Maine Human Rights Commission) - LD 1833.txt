Re LD 1833 An Act To Amend the Definition of "Educational Institution" Under the lvlaine Human 
Rights Act to Include Single-sex Educational Institutions 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
The Maine Human Rights Commission ("Commission") is Maine's quasi-independent, neutral, apolitical State 
agencyl charged with enforcing our state anti-discrimination law, the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M R S §§ 
4551, et seq (”MHRA" or the ”Act") The Commission IS statutorily charged with the duties of investigating, 
conciliating, and at times litigating discrimination cases under the MHRA and the Maine Whistleblowers' 
Protection Act ("WPA"), promulgating rules and regulations to effectuate the MHRA & WPA, and making 
recommendations for further legislation or executive action concerning infringements on human rights in 
Maine 5 M R S § 4566(7), (11) With those duties in mind, the Commission is pleased to provide this 
testimony in favor of LD 1833, An Act To Amend the Definition of ”Educational Institution ” Under the Maine 
Human Rights Act to Include Single-sex Educational Institutions 
This Bill would amend the definition of "educational institution" to remove an antiquated and overly broad 
exemption from the MHRA applicable to private ”single-sex" schools While this exemption made sense at 
the time the MHRA's education provisions were enacted, it is no longer appropriate, and should now be 
eliminated 
Background: MHRA Coverage of Discrimination in Education 
Recognizing a "basic human right to a life with dignity" , see 5 M R S § 4552, the Maine Legislature enacted 
the MHRA in 1971 to ”prevent discrimination in employment, housing or access to public accommodations" 
on account of a protected trait In 1983, the Legislature added Subchapter V-B to the MHRA to prohibit 
discrimination in education Me Pub L 1987 c S78, § 3 However, it prohibited only discrimination on the 
basis of sex Id ”Educati0na| institution" was defined as ”any public school or educational program, any 
public post-secondary institution, any private school or educational program approved for tuition purposes if 
1 
The Commission itself is made up of five Commissioners, appointed by the Governor for staggered five-year terms By 
statute, there can be no more than three Commissioners from any political party 5 M R S § 4561
\x 
both male and female students are admitted and the governing body of each such school or program " 
Id ,§ 
2 Excluding schools that admitted only male or female students ("single-sex schools") from this definition 
made sense, since the only applicable protected class was sex 
Over time, the Legislature added protected classes to Subchapter V-B, including disability in 1987, national 
origin in 1989, race in 1991, and sexual orientation in 2005 The definition of educational institution, 
however, was largely ignored, except that in 1995, the Legislature amended the definition to ensure that 
single-sex schools approved for tuition purposes were "educational institut|ons" for "purposes related to 
disability discrimination" Me Pub L 1995 c 393, § 4, see also 5 M R S §4553(2-A) 
In 2021, the Commission submitted a Bill, sponsored by Senator Craig Hickman, entitled ”An Act to Improve 
Consistency Within the Maine Human Rights Act " 
See L D 1688 (2021) Among other things, that Bill sought 
to clarify the protected classes covered by Subchapter V-B ofthe MHRA, since it was inconsistent with other 
parts of the MHRA (for example, it prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, but not color) This Bill was 
passed by the Legislature, signed by the Governor, and became effective on October 18, 2021 
LD 1833 ls Necessary to Complete the Update of the Education Provisions of the MHRA 
As is sometimes the case with updating laws in a piecemeal fashion, it appears that the 2021 legislation 
overlooked the definition of ”educational institution" As discussed above, while a blanket exemption from 
the Act made sense when the Act prohibited only discrimination in education based on sex, that time has 
long since passed Plainly put, there is no reason for single-sex schools to be permitted to discriminate on the 
basis of race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, and/or sexual orientation or gender identity, even if 
they were exempt from the prohibition of discrimination based on sex Moreover, given that there are no 
single-sex schools in Maine, the exemption applies to no entity in the state, making this an ideal time to 
remove the exemption, since it will not interfere with any existing educational program 
Conclusion 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony in favor of LD 1833 The Commission would be 
pleased to discuss these issues with you at your convenience, including at the work session on this matter 
Sincerely,
