Testimony of Representative Erin Sheehan introducing  LD 707 - An Act to Update the Maine Human Rights Act with Respect to Gender Identity before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  March 8, 2023  Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Esteemed Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Erin Sheehan and I represent part of Biddeford. Today I am pleased to introduce LD 707 - An Act to Update the Maine Human Rights Act with Respect to Gender Identity.  LD 23 proposes a simple clean-up to the Maine Human Rights Act by striking the current reference to “gender identity and expression” from the definition of sexual orientation. “Gender identity” was given its own definition in 2019. Removing the artifact reference to “gender identity and expression” from the definition of “Sexual orientation” will reflect the reality that sexual orientation is not defined by gender identity or expression, ensuring clarity and consistency within the Maine Human Rights Act. Thank you for your consideration. I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have.
