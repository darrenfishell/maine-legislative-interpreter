TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 707  
 
AN ACT TO UPDATE THE MAINE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT  
WITH RESPECT TO GENDER IDENTITY  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Commit-
tee, I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Boards Associa-
tion, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine School Boards 
Association, in support of L.D. 707.  
 
MSBA supports this bill because there is nuance between the terms “sexual orien-
tation ” and “gender identity ” and those differences should be reflected in statute. 
The proposed change to the statute makes this distinction.   
 
Simply stated, sexual orientation is more often defined around whom a person 
wants to be with, whereas gender identity is about who you are.  
 
The law reads:  
“Gender identity ” means the gender -related identity, appearance, mannerisms or 
other gender -related characteristics of an individual, regardless of the individual ’s 
assigned sex at birth. [PL 2019, c. 464, §1 (NEW).]  
 
The obligation of School Board members is to create policy and make decisions 
that assure all students are treated fairly in public schools and are not discriminat-
ed against for any reason. This bill supports that obligation.
