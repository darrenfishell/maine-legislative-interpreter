Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Testimony of Maine Transgender Network and EqualityMaine.
LD 707: An Act to Update the Maine Human Rights Act with Respect to Gender 
Identity
March 8, 2023
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary 
Committee: my name is Gia Drew, I am the Executive Director of EqualityMaine, and I am 
testifying today on behalf of MaineTransNet and EqualityMaine in support of LD 707: An Act 
to Update the Maine Human Rights Act with Respect to Gender Identity and in support of 
Rep. Sheehan's amendment. 
With respect to the bill as drafted: LD 707 is a simple clean up. In 2019, the Maine Human 
Rights Act was amended to include Gender Identity as a stand alone category. This change 
reflected the reality that gender identity is a unique part of the human experience distinct 
from sexual orientation. Who we are is different from who we love. LD 707 completes this 
shift by removing gender identity from the definition of sexual orientation. This will create 
more clarity in the Maine Human Rights Act and will not threaten the protection of gender 
minorities. 
I urge you to support this bill, and to vote out to pass on LD 707.
