Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education 
and Cultural Affairs Committees:  
LD 1018 , An Act to Increase the Membership of the State Board of Education and Review 
the Board's Responsibilities, Functions and Staffing  proposes to add one member to the 
State Board of Education who must be a current or former Departmentâ€™s Maine Teacher of 
the Year awardee and would serve a 3 -year term.  
The creation of the working group and implementation of the study proposed in LD 1018 
to review the responsibilities, functions and staffing of the State Board of Educatio n is 
work the Department of Education is not opposed to. The delegation of staff time and 
resources will require additional funding. The Department estimates an added expense of 
$5,000 to complete this requirement.  
The Department will be available to provi de additional information on LD 1018 and 
respond to any questions during the upcoming work session.   
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Courtney Belolan  
Director of Policy and Government Affairs
