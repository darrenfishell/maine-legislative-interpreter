Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on 
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs:
My
name
is
Matt
Bernstein,
I
am
a
resident
of
Portland
and
I
am
the
2023
Maine
T eacher
of
the
Y ear .
In
this 
testimony ,
I
am
speaking
as
a
private
citizen
and
not
as
a
representative
of
any
school,
district,
or
or ganization.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
testimony
in
favor
of
LD
#1018.
I
ur ge
you
to
support
this
bill.
This
bill
is
important
to
me
because
I
believe
that
it
is
essential
to
have
teacher
voices
in
conversations
and 
decisions
about
education
policy
because
policy
decisions
so
often
play
out
at
the
classroom
level
and
have 
such
a
profound
impact
on
teachers
and
students
in
classrooms.
Bringing
in
a
current
teacher
would
of fer
a
new 
and
valuable
perspective
to
the
board
and
would
improve
education
in
Maine.
In
my
current
role
as
Maine
T eacher
of
the
Y ear ,
I
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
with
the
State
Board
at
a
recent 
workshop
session.
I
remain
grateful
for
the
opportunity
I
was
given
to
share
some
of
my
thoughts
on
teaching 
and
learning
and
I
was
especially
pleased
that
I
had
a
chance
to
share
the
perspectives
of
my
students
on 
ef fective
teaching
and
the
things
that
they
said
were
important
to
them
within
school
environments.
The
board 
members
and
I
were
able
to
have
a
collaborative
and
productive
conversation
about
how
we
can
support
both 
our
students
and
our
teachers.
I
left
feeling
inspired
and
ener gized
about
my
work
in
the
classroom
and
eager
to 
continue
striving
to
provide
the
most
excellent
education
possible
to
all
students
in
Maine.
Furthermore,
the 
conversation
helped
me
reflect
on
my
own
practice
and
consider
how
I
can
continue
to
improve.
This 
experience
has
further
solidified
my
belief
that
connecting
teachers
with
education
policymakers
is
beneficial
to 
all.
When
we
bring
teachers
into
the
conversation,
we
end
up
with
better
policies,
which
leads
to
a
more 
supportive
and
productive
learning
environment
for
teachers
and
students.
Expanding
the
opportunity
for
these 
kinds
of
conversations
by
having
a
practicing
teacher
on
the
board
for
all
meetings
will
only
increase
the
great 
work
that
happens
when
teachers
and
education
policymakers
work
together .
I
wish
to
stress
that
I
greatly
admire
and
appreciate
the
board
and
think
that
the
members
are
doing
excellent 
work
so
this
is
not
intended
to
take
away
from
their
work
and
their
expertise.
I
simply
think
that
a
practicing 
teacher
could
add
value
to
the
already
excellent
work
happening
on
the
State
Board.
Furthermore,
a
teacher 
board
member
could
represent
the
lar ger
teacher
community
in
Maine.
This
could
of fer
other
teachers
a
point 
person
that
they
could
contact
on
the
board
to
share
thoughts,
ideas,
and
questions.
Finally ,
I
think
having
a 
teacher
on
the
board
communicates
an
important
public
message
about
listening
to
teachers,
trusting
our 
teachers,
and
viewing
them
as
experts
in
their
field.
For
all
these
reasons,
I
think
having
a
practicing
teacher
on
the
State
Board
would
be
an
asset
and
would
help 
improve
education
in
Maine.
I
strongly
ur ge
the
Committee
to
vote
unanimously
ought
to
pass.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
for
the
opportunity
to
testify ,
and
for
considering
this
in
your
deliberations.
