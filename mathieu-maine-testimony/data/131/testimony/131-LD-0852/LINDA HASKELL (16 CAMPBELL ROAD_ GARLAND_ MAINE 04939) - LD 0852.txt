LD 852  PH054  March 15/23 11AM     Oppose an Amendment to the Constitution of 
Maine to Change the Length of Legislators" Term to 4 Years
LINDA P. HASKELL in opposition to this bill LD582 PH054
We the people have the opportunity to vote on the election every 2 years and that is a 
good time period to find the values of the person holding that position. If this is to be 
changed, I would not be a happy or prosperous time with a terrible public official for 
the remainder of 2 years, if that became the term limit. It would be like a dirty suit 
that begins to smell. I oppose this bill for the change of a 4 year term.
