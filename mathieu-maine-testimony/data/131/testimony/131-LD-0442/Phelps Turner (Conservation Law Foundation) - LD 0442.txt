I appreciate this opportunity to testify in opposition to LD 442, An Act Regarding Renewable Energy Projects.  CLF, founded in 1966, is a public interest advocacy group that works to solve the environmental challenges threatening the people, natural resources and communities in Maine and across New England. In Maine for almost four decades, CLF is a member-supported organization that works to ensure that laws and policies are developed, implemented and enforced that protect and restore our natural resources; are good for Maine’s economy and environment; and equitably address the climate crisis.  CLF opposes LD 442 because it will impair the state’s ability to reap the economic benefits of renewable energy projects and to timely satisfy its clean energy and climate obligations, including under 35-A M.R.S. § 3210 and 38 M.R.S. § 576-A. Further, LD 442 will create unnecessary delay with respect to mitigating the negative impacts of climate change, which are already being experienced in Maine. The state has delayed on climate action for far too long. Time is of the essence, and LD 442 will deprive Maine of valuable time needed to develop renewable energy projects that can help the state mitigate climate change.  Renewable energy development in Maine presents economic development opportunities throughout the associated supply chains1 and can have a “significant positive impact on the economy.”2 Furthermore, in-state renewable energy resources can provide more stable energy costs, and the economic benefits and payments for purchase of these sources of energy can stay within the state, rather than going to out-of-state fossil fuel providers.3 As the 2023 Maine Offshore Wind Roadmap indicates, “[o]ffshore wind can spur economic growth throughout the State, including rural communities, communities undergoing economic transitions, and regions with limited economic development options.”4  1 Maine Governor’s Energy Office, “Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment,” prepared by Energy and Environmental Economics and Applied Economics Clinic, March 2021, https://www.maine.gov/energy/studies-reports-working-groups/current-studies-working-groups/renewable-energy-market-assessment, at 11. 2 “Resolve To Study Transmission Solutions To Enable Renewable Energy Investment in the State, Stakeholder Study, Final Report,” January 3, 2020, https://www.maine.gov/energy/sites/maine.gov.energy/files/inline-files/LD1401_Transmission_Renewable_Energy%20Study_Stakeholder%20Report.pdf, at 3. 3 Maine Governor’s Energy Office, “Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment,” at 11. 4 Maine Offshore Wind Roadmap, Feb. 2023, https://www.maine.gov/energy/sites/maine.gov.energy/files/inline-files/Maine_Offshore_Wind_Roadmap_February_2023.pdf.  
  
  -2-    According to the Maine Governor’s Energy Office, renewable energy resources will be needed as early as 2026 to meet the state’s increasing renewable portfolio standard (RPS), and action to develop these resources is needed well before 2026.5 LD 442 greatly jeopardizes the state’s ability to have renewable resources on-line by 2026.  The Legislature recently directed the state to develop renewable energy generation and transmission projects in Northern Maine to, among other things, “advance the renewable energy and climate policies and goals of the State.”6 These mandated projects will create economic opportunities and help Maine meet its renewable energy and climate mandates. As the Public Utilities Commission indicated, “[t]hese projects will provide significant benefits to Maine and the region, including jobs during construction, property tax revenue for local communities, and environmental benefits from new renewable energy displacing fossil fuels.”7  Similarly, the Maine Climate Council has determined that “[t]ransitioning to cleaner energy generation and greater energy efficiency offers exciting new economic opportunity. Maine currently spends roughly $4.4 billion annually on imported fossil fuels. Clean and renewable energy solutions can help keep those energy dollars in Maine, catalyzing a transformative economic impact, while significantly reducing emissions.”8  LD 442 would delay development of renewable energy projects, like those approved under the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program, and would thus harm Maine’s economy, impair Maine’s ability to satisfy its climate obligations and hinder Maine’s ability to mitigate the impacts of climate change.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in opposition to LD 442.
