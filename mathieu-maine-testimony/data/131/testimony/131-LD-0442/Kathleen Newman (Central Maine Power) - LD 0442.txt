LD 442 An Act Regarding Renewable Energy Projects 
March 8, 2023 
Testifying: Neither for Nor Against 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology, my name is Kathleen Newman, presenting testimony neither for nor 
against LD 442 An Act Regarding Renewable Energy Projects. 
CMP supports the concept of creating a commission to study Maine's energy policies. Many of 
the duties outlined in the bill are underway and or being examined by the either the Maine 
Public Utilities Commission, Office of the Public Advocate or the Governor's Energy Office. Even 
so, there could be value in having a legislatively-created commission like the one contemplated â€˜ 
here, review their ongoing work holistically to ensure there isn't either duplicative or 
contradictory work going on and to consider and analyze the effects of the varied efforts to 
transition to renewable sources of electrical generation and to meet Maine's renewable resource 
electricity goals. 
We do not support the temporary moratorium on renewable resources suggested in this bill. 
Policymakers have set out a path and goals for increasing Maine's usage of renewable energy 
resources and we do not believe a blanket moratorium sends the correct message to those who 
would invest in our State. 
Thank you for your consideration.
