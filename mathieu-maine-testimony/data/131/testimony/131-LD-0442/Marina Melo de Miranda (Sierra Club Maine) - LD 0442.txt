Re:
Testimony in Opposition to LD 442: An Act Regarding
Renewable Energy Projects
 
Senator Mark Lawrence, S. Paige Ziegler, and members of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology
Committee, I am testifying on behalf of Sierra Club Maine, representing over 22,000 supporters and
members statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra Club is one of our nation’s oldest and largest environmental
organizations. We work diligently to amplify the power of our 3.8 million members and supporters
nation-wide as we work towards combating climate change and promoting a just and sustainable
economy. To that end, we urge an “ought not to pass” report on LD 442: An Act Regarding Renewable
Energy Projects.
L.D. 442 proposes to put a halt on the approval of new renewable projects until a comprehensive state
energy plan is developed and the Public Utilities Commission develops an energy market analysis report.
While the need to have a comprehensive state energy plan for Maine is understandable, it makes no sense
to halt new renewable energy projects. More renewable resources are needed to meet the goals we have
committed to as set by L.D. 1494 that was passed back in 2019

. We will only be able to face the
challenge of climate change by achieving these goals.
For the coming years, we need more electrical energy production as demand for energy increases. Putting
a halt to renewable energy projects would force us to seek alternatives such as finding sources that not
only make climate change worse, but are also more expensive in many cases. We could also be forced to
buy energy from Canada and/or other states and thus export Mainers’ dollars which could be saved by
having our own energy sources

An energy market assessment was developed in 2021 to address the feasibility of L.D. 1494. The energy
market assessment is “State of Maine Renewable Energy Goals Market Assessment” and can be found
online.

Perhaps this legislative effort has been made to ensure that the drawbacks of the renewable energy
buildout since the 2019 legislation don’t continue.  But this effort is the wrong approach, and we

anticipate that the Maine Public Utilities Commission will find sponsors to correct the defects in this
legislative session so that we can go forward with confidence in building renewable energy generation.
Putting a halt on renewable energy projects will only delay the urgently needed transition to renewable
energy, and we cannot afford the delay any further. For this reason, we urge an “ought not to pass” report
on L.D. 442:
An Act Regarding Renewable Energy Projects

Thank you for your time and consideration.
