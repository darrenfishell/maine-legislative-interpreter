TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1128 
 
AN ACT TO ADDRESS STUDENT HUNGER AND NUTRITION THROUGH  
EXPANDED ACCESS TO FREE MILK IN SCHOOLS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  I 
am Steven Bail ey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association , in support of  L.D. 1128 . 
 
This bill is a simple step  to make sure our students have  something nutritious to drink by providing free mil k 
to all student s who wish to have i t. L.D. 1128 also provides milk to students who bring their own lunch . 
Currently only students who are provided a full school nutrition prepar ed meal are eligible to get  milk with 
their meal.  At this time, these meals are provided free of charge to students and their families.  Students 
bringing their lunch are required to purchase milk to drink with their lunch.  Providing milk for free also takes 
away any stigma attach ed to reduced or free meal s and drinks tied to income levels.  
 
A change  urged within the bill is to provide a non -dairy mi lk substitute for students with dairy allergies or 
sensitivitie s in addition to milk . 
 
Our Associations  are in  agreement that milk sh ould be provided for fre e to those students bringing their lunch 
from hom e, and encourage the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs to vote ought to 
pass.
