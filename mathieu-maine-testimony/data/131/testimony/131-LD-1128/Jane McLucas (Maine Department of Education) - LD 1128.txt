Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee : 
LD 1128 , An Act to Address Student Hunger and Nutrition Through Expanded Access to Free 
Milk in Schools (EMERGENCY) , proposes changing the school food service program laws to 
require participating public schools to provide free milk to all students, regardless of whether 
they receive a lunch through the program or bring their own lunch. The bill also requires the 
Department of Education's rules and standards about food and beverages outside school lunch 
programs to reflect the re quirement for free milk.  
The Maine Department of Education’s Child Nutrition team provides oversight, technical 
assistance and support for school administrative units ( SAUs ) participating in the National 
Scho ol Lunch Program (NSLP). Meals within the NSLP consist of five (5) components, 
meat/meat alternative, fruit, vegetables, a grain and milk. Consuming a meal with all five 
components remains  the best way for students to meet daily National Dietary guidelines . Federal 
Regulations require that students take three components for the meal to qualify as a reimbursable 
meal. The State of Maine is currently funding (paying) for each student to receiv e that 
reimbursable meal , free of charge.  We want to encourage families to participate in the program 
to normalize the lunch experience and eliminate stigma in our schools.  
School administrative units currently use the federal guidelines called  Smart Snack s. There are 
no State of Maine guidelines. These regulations address the sale of food and beverage outside of 
the NSLP on school grounds during the  school day,  are requ ired to be implemented by any 
NSLP , and should be incorporate d into each school’s local wellness policy.  Under these 
regulations, schools are permitted to sell milk to students.   
Currently, SAUs receive reimbursement for NSLP complete meals through CNPWeb, the Child 
Nutrition team’s reimbursement system. The Department  currently does not collect ala cart 
information from SAU’s. Transitioning to serving milk as part of the Maine program would 
require an enhancement to the claims system (approximately $20,000)  in addition to  a minimum , 
forty plus (40+) hours of planning, development, and testing of revised functionality. Due to 
current system enhancements and the system development timeline, these enhancements would 
not be available until the 2025 -2026 school year.  In addition to the  system enhancements  costs

listed, an estimated cost to  the state to  reimburse districts for one white milk would be $250,000 
per year  based on the current state -wide  average cost of milk  at $.33.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1128  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Jane McLucas  
Director, Child Nutrition
