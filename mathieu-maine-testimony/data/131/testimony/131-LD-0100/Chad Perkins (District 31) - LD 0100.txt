MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: LD 100 An Act to Require an Annual Financial Audit of a Private School 
Approved for Tuition Purposes
Committee Chair Senator Rafferty , Committee Chair Representative Brennan and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs,
   I would like to offer my strong opposition to LD 100, An Act to Require an Annual 
Financial Audit of a Private School Approved for Tuition Purposes.
   Under Title 20 §2953, nonsectarian private schools that receive public funds are already
subject to special audits as may deemed necessary by the Commissioner of the 
Department of Education. Additionally, the Commissioner already has the authority to 
create rules for such schools under §2954 to create additional audit requirements. 
Already, some private schools, if operated as non-profit or charitable organizations, 
already have reporting requirements to the Attorney General of the State of Maine under 
Title 9 §5005-A or to the federal government under 26 USC  §501-C-3.
   Under the proposal of LD 100, the state would impose an audit and reporting 
requirement for all private schools, including schools that do not receive any public 
funds, are privately funded and are not operate as a charitable organization and 
specifically faith based schools that do not receive public funds. This group of schools 
includes private ‘umbrella schools’ that supervise and coordinate groups of home-school 
families. This would not only create an unnecessary financial hardship for many smaller 
private schools that are completely privately funded, but would bring about an egregious 
overreach by government into the private financial concerns and records of private 
entities.
   There is no need to create further legislation or expand bureaucracy to gain information
that is already available when appropriate or to gain access to private financial records 
when it is not and as such I strongly encourage that the committee vote “Ought Not To 
Pass” on LD 100.
