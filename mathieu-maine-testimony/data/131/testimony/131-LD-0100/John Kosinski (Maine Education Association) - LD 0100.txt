Testimony  
In Support  
LD 100: An Act to Require an Annual Financial Audit of a Private  School Approved for Tuition 
Purposes  
John Kosinski, Government Relations Director, Maine Education Association  
Before the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  
March  2, 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee,   
 
My name is John Kosinski (he/him)  and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations for 
the Maine Education Association (MEA).  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of Maine, 
including teachers and other professionals in nearly every public school in the state an d faculty and other 
professional staff in the University of Maine and Community College Systems.  
 
I am here on behalf of the MEA in support of LD 100, An Act to Require an Annual Financial Audit of a 
Private School Approved for Tuition Purposes.   
 
In the  wake of the United Supreme Court decision in Carson v Makin, now is the perfect time to ensure 
private schools approved for tuition purposes are subject to basic financial transparency.  LD 100 
requires these private schools to submit annual audits.  This  is warranted because we will likely see more 
schools apply for approval under the state’s current process.  We would hope the state and this 
committee will want to make sure schools approved to receive public taxpayer money are at least 
required to annual ly audit their finances and to submit those audits for public review.  Our public 
schools not only adopt their entire budgets before the voters in their communities, but also are required 
to conduct annual audits by “qualified certified public accountants or accountants registered with the 
Board of Accountancy (see Title 20 -A, §6051, subsection 3).  LD 100 will apply a similar auditing 
standard for the private schools eligible for public money.   
 
Title 20 -A, Chapter 117 governs the process for private scho ols to be approved for tuition purposes.  
Surprisingly, §2951 subsection 4 included a section on “reports and audits” but language from this 
section was repealed, including a specific section on “annual audits” found in §2953.  Instead, the 
second subsecti on of §2953 remains, allowing for three officers of the private school to request an audit, 
but the language requiring annual audits was repealed.

Instead, subsection 5 of §2951 specifies “additional requirements” for private schools to be approv ed for 
public money.  The first section referenced is §2952 which provides the school must “report to the 
commissioner the information the commissioner may require.”  Arguably, under current law the  
 
Commissioner can require private schools to submit to a nnual audits and much more, but there is no 
downside to specifically defining in statute the requirements necessary to receive public dollars.   
 
The overall impact of Carson v Makin will be limited in Maine.  It only impacts towns that provide 
blanket fun ding for students to attend any school they choose.  Overwhelmingly, most Maine cities and 
towns provide for a full preK -12 public school system for residents.  Towns that do not operate public 
schools are still empowered to contract with specific schools,  both public and those private schools 
approved for tuition purposes and provide those options to students in their communities.  However, we 
fully expect more private schools to compete for funding from the towns that provide choice programs.  
Given the l ikelihood of greater interest from private schools in accessing public funding, the minimum 
the state should require is annual audits of their finances as called for in this legislation.  
 
Thank you for your time, your attention and your service to Maine.  I will do my best to answer any 
questions you may have.
