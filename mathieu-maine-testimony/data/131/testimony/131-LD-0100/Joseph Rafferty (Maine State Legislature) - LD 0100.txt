Senator, District 34 13 l st Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Testimony of Senator Joe Ra]j’erty in Support of 
LD 100, An Act to Require an Annual Financial Audit of a Private School Approved for Tuition Purposes 
Before the Senate Committee on Education and Cultural Aﬂairs 
Thursday, March 2, 2023 
Good afternoon Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the people of 
Senate District 34 including Berwick, North Berwick, Wells, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport. 
l’m submitting testimony in support of LD 100, “An Act to Require an Annual Financial 
Audit of a Private School Approved for Tuition Purposes. ” 
This bill requires a private school approved for tuition purposes to submit to the State Auditor an 
annual audit that demonstrates that the books, accounts, ﬁnancial documents and reports of the 
school are in a satisfactory and accurate condition. 
l have to say that I was quite surprised when asked to co-sponsor this bill. The surprise was that 
we weren’t already requiring such a report. In an effort to prepare myself for today, I went 
through the DOE budget looking for some answers as to the totals involved. Needless to say, that 
was difficult to do on my own. Eventually, I made a request through DOE and was able to get 
some facts. 
SAU’s pay out to private schools at the secondary level, a total of $53,337,366.66 for tuition. If 
you factor in all the services needed the total jumps to $82,674,284.8l K-12. 
This being my third year in this committee, I know that we have scrutinized budgets and 
ﬁnancial requests very closely. Recently, we’ve spent much of our time reviewing LD 298. 
It’s my opinion that to request clarity to spending public funds by any branch of govermnent isa 
reasonable and responsible request. 
Thank you and I will do my best to answer any question you may have.
