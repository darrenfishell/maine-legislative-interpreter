Approved for Tuition Purposes

Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Joint Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs: 
Myi name is Michael McQuarrie, and I am the Head of School of Erskine Academy in South 
China, a position I have held for the last 15 of my 25 years with the Academy. I testify today on 
behalf of my school and the Maine Association of Independent Schools (MAIS) in opposition to 
LD l0O,i An Act to Require an Annual Financial Audit of a Private School Approved for 
Tuition Purposes. , 
The 23 "MAIS members are a diverse group of educational institutions, including Maine's earliest 
secondary school, Berwick Academy, dating to the 18th century, with charters signed by 
Governor-John Hancock, as well as much newer schools, schools with varied missions, schools 
that serve publicly-supported students primarily, and one sectarian school; MAIS schools 
educate 9000' students in pre-K through Grade 12, with 4600 publicly funded and 4400 privately 
ﬁnanced. MAIS schools have in common their accreditation by the New England Association of 
Schools and Colleges.' 
MAIS testiﬁes in opposition to this bill not because nearly all of our member schools do not- 
engage in annual audits; we do. We oppose this bill as it seeks to remedy a problem that is not 
there but is instead a solution in search of a problem. To our knowledge, this bill's sponsor has 
not provided to this Committee or us a speciﬁc reason why this bill is necessary.A
' 
1. The State justiﬁably repealed the proof of audit requirement in 2011. 
As many of you know, the requirement to provide proof of an audit was repealed in 2011 ina 
Department of Education omnibus bill (LD 1307, PL 201 l, c. 153). At‘ that time, the DOE 
brought this change, among others, to the education statute, as it was a requirement that the DOE 
felt was no longer necessary. The MSMA and MPA were the only entities that testified regarding 
the bill and neither opposed the bill nor commented on this change. The organization I represent 
today, the MAIS, did not testify on the bill nor offer comment. The Education Committee voted 
in a bipartisan manner to unanimously approve LD 1307. Why reinstate a requirement that was 
repealed over a decade ago? 
2. Independent schools already have levels of accountability regarding their finances. 
While we have discussed with many of you the critical place that Town Academies have in 
Maine's educational landscape and history, MAIS is concerned that there is an increasing desire 
to strip the Town Academies of their independence. However, we have not been provided with
any evidence beyond the anecdotal to justify this action. -We ﬁrmly believe that the students who 
attend the Town Academies, the parents who choose to send them to our schools, and the 
sending units are satisﬁed with, if not delighted by, the educational services and experiences they 
provide. We also have not heard complaints regarding our current system of ﬁnancial 
management and the level of oversight for the same.' 
The independent schools’ public funds for educational services come from local, sending 
municipalities that exercise a legally-provided and historical option to use their property tax» 
revenue and state funds allocated to them to attend our schools as a collective, or the decision is 
given to their individual residents. Depending on local arrangements, many of our schools 
already provide ﬁnancial information on their websites, up to and sometimes including budget 
and audits. The most recent to do so was initiated by George Stevens Academy. 
The independent schools have responded successfully to their student and family consumers and 
communities as evidenced by robust enrollments. The public funds that private schools" receive 
for tuition come from local sending communities, not directly from the State, and partially pay 
that student's cost to attend the school. The Town Academies engage their communities witha 
spirit of cooperation and commitment that has become a heritage and enabled us to remain 
prominent in our service regions of Maine for 200 years in many cases. We have~yet to receive 
speciﬁc information from the DOE, the Education Committee, or the Sponsor of this bill that our 
communities are dissatis ﬁed or unhappy with our schools.- 
Currently, independent schools are accountable to the State and the public through several 
avenues. Our schools approved for public tuition purposes already account annually for spending 
up to or beyond the State set tuition rate per student by submitting the DOE-required Year-End 
Report of Private' Schools (EF-M-240). These reports account for the public ﬁJl1’1dS received from 
the State. Does the Education Committee or the DOE currently review these reports? 
Additionally, independent schools undergo rigorous accreditation by the New -England I 
Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) Commission on Independent Schools (a process 
endorsed in Maine law (20-A M.R.S.A., ss. 2901 (2)(A). A continuous re-accreditation cycle 
ensures quality control and regular compliance with the ﬁnancial standards and reviews of audits 
of ﬁnancial information. _ .A
, 
Every independent school is also required to ﬁle a 990 Form with the IRS, which is an annual 
information return that most organizations claiming federal tax-exempt status must ﬁle yearly. . 
These can be easily found online and are generally accessible on-site to the public. In sum, our 
schools already provide a yearly accounting of public funds received from sending towns. 
LD 100 chips at the independence of our schools because it potentially seeks information to 
make public that which is not public about our operations; it does not differentiatebetween_ 
public and private funds. Public disclosure —particular1y to those outside our service areas—— 
about how we spend our monies is not a general requirement of other private institutions 
receiving public funding. We provide a public service because we have been asked to—because 
we are chosen—-and because it is consistent with our historic missions.
3. If this bill were to pass, there are several necessary amendments to the bill. 
Common to our schools is providing clarity to sending schools, local communities, and school 
unit afﬁliates. If this bill were to pass, it would need to be amended. The schedule for reporting, 
as currently proposed, is impractical, and the bill's accompanying Summary inaccurately deﬁnes 
"satisfactory proof’ as it is referred to in the bill. We suggest that the timing of the submission of 
"satisfactory proof‘ of the annual audit be extended until at least December 31$‘ of each year. It 
would be acceptable that the audit is "started" by September ls‘ . We further suggest that the 
Summary be edited to clarify that "satisfactory proof“ of an audit is to be submitted, not the audit 
itself. We strongly object to providing full audit details. For your consideration, we have' 
attached to my written testimony a revised version of the bill thatincorporates these changes. 
We also suggest that if this requirement is adopted, which we discourage, it should only apply to 
schools that enroll over 60% publicly-supported students. Some of our Maine private schools 
only enroll several publicly-supported students, and it may not be economically feasible for these 
schools to perform an annual audit; however, they do follow the ﬁnancial guidelinesfor NEASC 
Accreditation. If this bill were to pass and these schools were to forego the requirements of this 
bill and not be permitted to enroll publicly-supported students, this would be a loss for Maine 
students and their families. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify regarding LD 100.
