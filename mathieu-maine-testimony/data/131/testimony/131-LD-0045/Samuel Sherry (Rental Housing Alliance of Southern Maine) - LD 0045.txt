LD 45
In brief, over the course of thirty years of practice in Maine I have come to conclude 
that Maine judges do a good job judging.
LD 45 proposes to change the current law and practice -- under which judges decide 
what happened, based on evidence -- and simply tell them what to find.
I have a few examples to discuss, and hope to be able to do so.
