LD 45
I oppose LD 45.  Our lease states that we will ensure the tenants that we rent to have a
home that where they are safe and comfortable. It has been our experience that tenants
that need to be evicted or those with a history of previous evictions jeopardize 
standards that we try to uphold for our renters.
