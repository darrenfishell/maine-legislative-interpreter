LD 45
I oppose LD 45 as it will impose an undue financial burden on the already expensive & time 
consuming process of just eviction.   Frivolous, untimely, and undocumented retaliation 
claims undermine the serious nature
in which these issues need to be addressed. Failure by either the tenant OR the
landlord to document any failure to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the rental agreement
demonstrates a disregard to the contract. To do so "after the fact" sets a concerning 
precedent.
If a tenant is going to claim retaliatory eviction, then they must demonstrate that they asserted
their rights about a concern prior to being served an eviction notice. How can a landlord be 
retaliating against an assertion of rights if there is no evidence that rights had been asserted?
