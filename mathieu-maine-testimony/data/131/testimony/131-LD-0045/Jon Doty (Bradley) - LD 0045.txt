LD 45
I write to oppose LD 45 as currently written. I am a small-scale apartment manager 
who works hard to meet my responsibilities to my tenants.  In most cases my tenants 
and I have had great business relationships, and tenants often continue renting from 
me for many years until their life circumstances change.  I have had to use the F.E.D. 
process only once in 18 years; it took a frustratingly long period of time to remove a 
tenant who stopped paying rent and was doing damage to the apartment.  There were 
many maneuvers that tenant took to prolong their time taking advantage of the 
apartment without paying rent; I see LD 45 as likely adding to that suite of maneuvers
by further putting the burden of proof on the apartment manager rather than a shared 
burden of proof / evidence.  Simply put, apartment managers have no incentive to ask 
tenants who are meeting their responsibilities to leave; LD 45 would make it harder to
be a small business owner/manager in Maine.
