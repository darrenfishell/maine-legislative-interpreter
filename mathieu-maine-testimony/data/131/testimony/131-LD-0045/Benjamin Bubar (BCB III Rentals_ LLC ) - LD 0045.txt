LD 45
I oppose LD45 for the following reasons:
If a tenant is going to claim retaliatory eviction, then they must demonstrate that they 
asserted their rights about a concern prior to being served an eviction notice. How can
a landlord be retaliating against an assertion of rights if there is no evidence had been 
asserted? 
Both landlords and tenants need to come to court with "clean hands" and transparent 
motives supported by documentation. A simple text, email, certificate of mailing, etc. 
should be expected evidence when time is of the essence in these matters. 
Frivolous, untimely, and undocumented retaliation claims undermine the serious 
nature in which these issues need to be addressed. Failure by either the tenant OR the 
landlord to document any failure to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the rental 
agreement demonstrates a disregard to the contract. To do so "after the fact" sets a 
concerning precedent.
