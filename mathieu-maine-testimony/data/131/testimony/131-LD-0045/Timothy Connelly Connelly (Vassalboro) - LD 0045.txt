LD 45
I oppose LD 45 an act to prevent retaliatory evictions.
here are some reasons why
if a tenant is going to claim retaliatory eviction then they must demonstrate that they asserted 
their rights about a concern prior to being served an eviction  notice. how can a landlord be 
retaliating  against an assertion of rights if there is no evidence that rights had been asserted?
both tenants and landlords need to come to court with clean hands and transparent 
motives supported by documentation. a simple text,email,certificate of mailing,etc. 
should be expected evidence when time is of the essence in these matters.
frivolous, untimely and undocumented retaliation claims undermines the serious 
nature in which these issues need to be addressed. failure by either party to document 
any failure to uphold the responsabilities outlined in the rental agreement 
demonstrates disreguard the law
