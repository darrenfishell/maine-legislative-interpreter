LD 45
LD45 to be a bad idea. 
LD45 will punish Landlords unjustly.  Landlords, who are business owners in our 
communities will find it difficult to stay in business.  
The Landlord's role of providing safe and affordable housing for the residents of Maine will be 
put in jeopardy. . 
LD45, would make it much easier for a tenant being evicted to claim the eviction is retaliatory,
even if this is a false claim.  We, as landlords and property managers, almost never evict 
good tenants, it is counter to good business practices.  Evictions for those who do not know, 
are already expensive and a time consuming process. If we start an eviction, we do so for 
very good reasons.  Allowing tenants to just claim itâ€™s retaliatory and end the process makes 
no sense and will not benefit the state of housing in Maine.  You will impact individuals who 
are business owners in our communities and therefore negatively impact housing Maine 
desperately needs.
