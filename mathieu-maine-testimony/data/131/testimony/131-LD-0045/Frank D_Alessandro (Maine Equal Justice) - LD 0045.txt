Testimony of Frank D’Alessandro, 
Maine Equal Justice 
In support of LD 45 
“"An Act to Prevent Retaliatory Evictions" 
February 9, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished 
members of the Committee on Judiciary. My name is Frank D’Alessandro, 
and I am the Legal Services Director of Maine Equal Justice. We area civil 
legal services organization, and We Work With and for p eople with low income 
seeking solutions to poverty through policy, education, and legal 
representation. Thank you for the opportunity to offer Written to you in 
support of LD 45. 
Maine Equal Justice supports LD 45 because it will ensure that tenants who 
as s ert their rights under Maine’ s Landlord Tenant Laws are not retaliated against 
by their landlords. 
Current Law 
Maine Law currently provides limited protections to tenants who assert their rights 
under Maine landlord tenant law. 14 M.R.S.§ 6001(3). (Attached). These 
p rotections do not cover tenants who are evicted b ecause they refuse to pay illegal 
rent increases. These protections are also so limited that a landlord can rebut the 
protections Without having to demonstrate that the tenant has done anything 
Wrong, even if the landlord ’s reason for evicting the tenant is arbitrary. ‘

What This Bill Does 
This bill expands the protections currently provided under Maine law in two ways. 
First, it provides protections that are absent in current law to tenants who refuse to 
pay illegalrent increases. Second, it deﬁnes whata landlord must prove in order to 
rebut the presumption of retaliation in current law by requiring a landlord to 
demonstrate that the tenant has violated a landlord tenant law or lease provision. 
Why Maine Equal Justice Supports LD 45 
This bill is necessary so that tenants do not face eviction and possible 
homelessness simply because they assert their rights under Maine Law. The 
threatposedbyretaliatory evictions has never been more serious given Maine’s 
current housing crisis. 
Affordability 
Even before the p andemic, Maine’ s rental housing market Was among the least 
affordable in the nation, and our state has not done enough to protect p eople Who are 
being priced out of their homes. According to MaineHousing ’ s 2020 annual report, 
Maine needs about 25,000 more affordable housing units to respond effectively to 
the need? Nearly 60% of extremely low-income households pay more than 50% of 
their monthly income towards rent, a threshold which HUD deems severely rent 
burdened? ‘ The end of federal rental assistance has left many Mainers Without help 
or affordable options. Thes e families continuously face the threat of eviction for non- 
p ayment. Finding affordable housing has b ecome so difficult, many Mainers become 
homeless because they simply cannot find an ap artment that meets their budget. 
Discrimination 
The lack of affordable housing is a racial equity issue as Well. In Maine as in the rest 
of the country, people of color are disproportionately harmed due to the lack of 
affordable housing. According to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, between 2017 and 
2019, 12% of households they representedin eviction court Were non -white, though 
only 5% of Maine’s population is non-White. Signiﬁcantly, according to a study 
conducted by the Maine State Housing Authority in 2022, 34% of Maine’ s homeless

population is Black or African American4 even though they make up less than 2% 
of Maine’s population.5 
In Maine, the joint Section 8 Waiting list which covers most of the state has over 
15,000 households on it. These families will Wait years for needed assistance. But 
even when these families do get vouchers, many will still struggle to ﬁnd safe, 
affordable housing. Too often, tenants face the unfair stigma that comes With 
p articipation in rental assistance p rograms. Maine must enact protections to p rohibit 
discrimination based on low-income tenants’ participation in rental assistance 
programs. 
Why the Tenant Protections Offered by this Bill are so Necessary 
N o one should lose their home and risk becoming homeless simply because they 
have asserted their right to live in safe, stable and affordable housing. 
Eviction filings in the State of Maine in December 2022 are 172 percent higher 
than filings in December 2021. 
Rising evictions are devastating families ’ finances, uprooting kids, causing job loss 
and stress, and increasing hunger and homelessness. Finding affordable housing in 
Maine has become so difficult that many Mainers become homeless simply because 
they cannot ﬁnd an apartment that meets their budget. 
When a tenant gets a 3 0 day no —cause eviction notice, they are put in the imp ossible 
p osition of ﬁnding a new ap aitment and moving With 30 days ’ notice, or risk going 
to eviction court and being forcibly removed from their home. 
Eviction —or the forcible removal of a family from their home-——is often a traumatic 
and highly consequential event, especially for low-income families. The Eviction 
Lab at Princeton University, a leading team of researchers working to highlight the 
prevalence, causes, and consequences of evictions nationwide, describes the fallout 
of eviction this Way: 
Eviction causes a family to lose their home. They often are also expelled from 
their community andtheir children have to switch schools. Families regularly 
lose their possessions, too, which are piled on the sidewalk or placed in 
storage, only to be reclaimed after paying a fee. A legal eviction comes with

a court record, which can prevent families ﬁom relocating to decent housing 
in a safe neighborhood, because many landlords screen for recent evictions. 
Studies also show that eviction caus es job loss, as the stressﬁil and drawn-out 
process of being forcibly expelled from a home causes people to make 
mistakes at work and lose their job. Eviction also has been shown to affect 
people's mental health: one study found that mothers who experienced 
eviction reported higher rates of depression two years after their move. The 
evidence strongly indicates that eviction is not just a condition of p oveity, it 
is a cause of it. 
Clearly, eviction causes financial losses to families who often lose their p ossessions 
and lose their jobs when they’re forced from their homes and communities. 6 It also 
causes enormous personal trauma with signiﬁcant repercussions to economic and 
p ersonal well-being. Research in the wake of the foreclosure crisis has tracked how 
housing instability negatively inﬂuences adult and children ’s physical and mental 
well-being including increasing the risk of depression in mothers? Eviction also 
increases suicide and anxiety.8 For children, it results in emotional and educational 
decline.9 
People who have been evicted go on to be shadowed by an eviction judgement on 
their record and damaged credit that prevents them from moving forward and 
rebuilding their ﬁnances. Evidence shows that many housing providers screen 
prospective tenants out of the application process based on the existence of an 
eviction ﬁling in a tenant’s name, regardless of the basis or the legal outcome. 1° As 
a result, families who have been evicted are often forced into p oorer neighborhoods 
and substandard housing. 
No tenant in Maine should have to suffer these consequences. But it is especially 
unfair to tenants simplybecause a tenant has asserted their rights under Maine State 
law. Though these tenants have done nothing wron g except fail the imp ossible task 
of ﬁnding a new home and moving within 30 days, they can suffer devastating

ﬁnancial and health fallout from eviction and be barred from future housing 
opportunities. 
All the evidence shows that Mainers’ health and well-being starts with havinga 
stable home and the opportunities that come with it. Maine should prevent all 
unnecessary evictions to ensure housing stability for Mainers. 
Conclusion 
For the above reasons Maine Equal Justice urges the Committee to vote ‘ought 
to pass’ on LD 45 so as to protect tenants who refuse to p ay illegal rent increases 
and set forth a clear standard that landlords must prove in order to rebut the 
presumption of retaliation that protects tenants who have asserted their rights 
under Maine’s landlord tenant laws. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony andl am happy to answer any 
questions.
