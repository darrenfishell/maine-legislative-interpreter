LD 45
After reviewing this I strongly oppose LD 45. If a tenant is going to claim retaliatory eviction, 
then they must demonstrate that they
asserted their rights about a concern prior to being served an eviction notice. How can a 
landlord be retaliating against an assertion of rights if there is no evidence that rights had 
been asserted?
Thank you for your time.
