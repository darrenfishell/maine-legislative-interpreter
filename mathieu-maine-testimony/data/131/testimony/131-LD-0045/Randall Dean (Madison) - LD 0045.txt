LD 45
As a landlord I oppose LD 45.  As rights are stripped away from landlords, landlords 
will be forced to implement stricter screening processes.  Including adding mandatory
background checks, credit checks and application fees.  Currently I do not require any
of these.  With the passing of LD45 I will be forced to take a defensive position with 
each new prospective tenant.  I own 25 rental units, and I have spent the last 10 years 
renovating these very nice homes.  The cost of materials, contract labor, insurance, 
and utilities have sky rocketed.  Please consider, not all tenants are perfect model 
citizens.  Today, the perpetual adolescence, immaturity and disrespect some tenants 
exhibit is beyond explanation.  As much as good tenants deserve the opportunity to 
rent quality housing, good landlords deserve quality tenants.  Please remember, 
landlords own the Fee Simple Rights of their properties and with the passing of 
legislature like LD45 you are stripping away those rights.  Many, many times over the
past 10 years I have taken a chance on a down on their luck prospect.  I will not do 
that, if LD45 passes.  Please remember, most landlords are good people who are not 
in the business of evicting good tenants.
