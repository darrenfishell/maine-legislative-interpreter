LD 45
The Judiciary Committee hearing LD-45 proposal needs to re-consider this bill. The 
bill as written is unconstitutional. Every person whether Plaintiff or defendant has the 
right to equal justice. To give a defendant an unfair advantage by not granting a 
Landowner a FED just because a defendant makes an accusation without proving 
their accusation is illegal. Whether a plaintiff or a defendant you have the burden of 
proof for every accusation put forth. Without proof the accusation is nothing more 
than perjury. LD-45 takes away a Landowners rights to choose who can live in 
THEIR property. A landowners property is according to Blacks Law Dictionary 7th 
edition, where it states, "the institution of private property is protected from undue 
Governmental interference!" The purpose of the Judiciary is not to oppress 
Landowners but to settle disputes fairly and equitably. I assure you LD-45 is not fair 
or equitable and should be re-written or opposed by all Committee members as 
written.
