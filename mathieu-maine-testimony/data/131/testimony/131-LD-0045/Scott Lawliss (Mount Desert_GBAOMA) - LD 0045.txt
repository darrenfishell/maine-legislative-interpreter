LD 45
I oppose LD45.  Evicting tenants is already very hard in Maine and I do not believe 
that retaliatory evictions is a serious problem worthy of a new law.  All this does is 
create more hurdles for landlords who want to legitimately evict tenants.  Being a 
landlord has many challenges.  If a landlord decides to take the time and incur and the
expense of eviction they should be able to do so without additional requirements.  
Good tenants are almost never evicted.  Almost all evictions happen for very good 
reasons.  The process is already very hard.  Landlords are in the business of providing
safe and affordable housing for Maine residents.  The harder you make it for us to do 
that the less housing we will be able to provide.  We are not the enemy.
