LD 45
I know LD45 to be a bad idea.  LD45 will make will make it harder for Landlords, who are 
business owners in our communities to actually stay in business.  Our role of providing safe 
and affordable housing for the residents of Maine will be put in jeopardy. . 
LD45, would make it much easier for a tenant being evicted to claim the eviction is retaliatory.
We, as landlords and property managers, almost never evict good tenants, it is counter to 
good business practices.  Evictions for those who do not know, are already expensive and a 
time consuming process. If we start an eviction, we do so for very good reasons.  Allowing 
tenants to just claim itâ€™s retaliatory and end the process makes no sense and will not benefit 
the state of housing in Maine.  You will impact individuals who are business owners in our 
communities and therefore negatively impact housing Maine desperately needs.
