LD 45
I oppose LD 45 "An Act to Prevent Retaliatory Evictions" as written.  Retaliatory 
evictions are already not allowed in Maine.  There needs to be a requirement of proof 
from both the Landlord and Tenant to ensure tenants rights are upheld and that 
landlords are able to protect their property.
