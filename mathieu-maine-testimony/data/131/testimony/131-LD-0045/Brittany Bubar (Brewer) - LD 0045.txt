LD 45
I oppose LD45 for the following reasons:
To "tie" a judgeâ€™s hands to specific wording in statute will require a boomerang effect
of rental agreements having to attempt to capture every SPECIFIC scenario under the 
sun that could arise that normally a judge could consider under umbrella policies of 
"disturbing the peaceful enjoyment by neighbors", "creating a fire safety concerns", 
keeping an animal under proper care an d supervision, etc. If a tenant claims 
retaliation a judge should be able to hear the evidence presented by all parties.
This will NOT benefit the state housing situation in Maine!
