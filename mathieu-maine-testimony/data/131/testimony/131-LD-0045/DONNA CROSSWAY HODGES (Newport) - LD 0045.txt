In the example of the So. Portland Redbank.  Didn't the testimony say they got a 45 day 
notice of a rent increase to take place (within the parameters of the law) but were asked to 
RESPOND whether they would accept that?  
If so I don't know how this would address this as they wouldn't be whistleblowers in that case 
because they got the 45 day notice.
