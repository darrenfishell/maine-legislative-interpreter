Here are some reasons we oppose this bill as written:
If a tenant is going to claim retaliatory eviction, then they must demonstrate that they
asserted their rights about a concern prior to being served an eviction notice. How can
a landlord be retaliating against an assertion of rights if there is no evidence that rights
had been asserted?
Both landlords and tenants need to come to court with "clean hands" and transparent
motives supported by documentation. A simple text, email, certificate of mailing, etc.
should be expected evidence when time is of the essence in these matters.
Frivolous, untimely, and undocumented retaliation claims undermine the serious nature
in which these issues need to be addressed. Failure by either the tenant OR the
landlord to document any failure to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the rental
agreement demonstrates a disregard to the contract. To do so "after the fact" sets a
concerning precedent.
To "tie" a judgeâ€™s hands to specific wording in statute will require a boomerang effect of
rental agreements having to attempt to capture every SPECIFIC scenario under the sun
that could arise that normally a judge could consider under umbrella policies of
"disturbing the peaceful enjoyment by neighbors", "creating a fire safety concerns",
keeping an animal under proper care and supervision, etc. If a tenant claims retaliation
a judge should be able to hear the evidence presented by all parties
