 1                                     Patti Duprey APRN, CDCES Diabetes Care Center 57 Portland Road Kennebunk ME 04032 Phone 207.467.3777   Fax 888.312.0662  I am a nurse practitioner and Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES)  With over 30 years of experience in diabetes management, I have a unique perspective on the importance of an accredited diabetes education program and support LD469. Before moving my practice to Maine, I was the Director at the Diabetes Center at Memorial Hospital in North Conway NH.  We were fortunate to have an accredited education program. This made my job of providing diabetes management more effective.  Every person with diabetes in that community had the opportunity to access diabetes education either through our diabetes center or by referral from the primary care provider.  This resulted in improvement of our quality measures related to glucose control, blood pressure and cholesterol. Plus, the added benefit of reducing hospitalization rates. We need to improve access to diabetes education programs to improve lives and reduce complications.  People with diabetes are 2-5 times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. For those over 50 years old with diabetes and known atherosclerotic heart disease, the life expectancy is decreased by 19 years.  Diabetes is also the number one reason for blindness and kidney dialysis. Although we have made progress in reducing amputations, diabetes remains a prominent factor in the loss of toes, feet and legs When I opened my private practice in Kennebunk, Southern Maine Visiting Nurses had an active diabetes education program staffed by dietitians and registered nurses.  Unfortunately, the program closed before I had the opportunity to refer patients for education.  Then a few years ago, York Hospital closed their accredited program as well.  Currently Maine Endocrinology is unable to accept new referrals for diabetes unless the person is in a critical situation or A1c value over 10%. (goal for diabetes is less than 7%).     Hospital diabetes educational programs have closed in Maine (and nationally) because they are not income producing.  Often times, the reimbursement structure is not 
 2 understood by hospital finance departments, which leads to the closing of programs.   Diabetes education programs will likely never be a money maker, but they can and do support themselves from the insurance reimbursement.  Medicare and most all commercial insurances cover diabetes education There is further burden on primary care providers to manage people with diabetes. As a diabetes specialist in private practice, I am able to control the number of patients I see each day and can provide some education within the context of the medical visit. This is a less than ideal situation combining treatment and education simultaneously. Often times it can be overwhelming to the person with diabetes.   But imagine the PCP with the 10–15-minute office visit that needs to adequately address the care of the newly diagnosed person with diabetes.  Or how about caring for the person with multiple complications of diabetes?  Primary Care Providers, no matter how knowledgeable, cannot adequately treat diabetes in a quick office visit.  They are set up for failure. We need to provide better resources for PCP’s to ensure people with diabetes will be successful with self-management.   Formal diabetes education helps people gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are needed to manage the chronic condition of diabetes.  This is crucial to improving health outcomes in people with diabetes. Research shows us the benefits of education. People with diabetes need providers who can offer appropriate treatment, but that is only part of the solution.  Southern York County needs an education program as part of the team approach. The CDC has provided grant money to the State of Maine for The Diabetes Prevention Program, known as DPP. This is an extremely beneficial program for those 373,000 people with pre-diabetes. The goal is to assist those with pre-diabetes to make behavioral changes to avert progression to Type 2 diabetes.  But we also need a diabetes education program for those already living with the challenges of diabetes. York county is the 2nd most populated county in the state of Maine yet there is no diabetes education program in the southern part.  Our county includes areas such as Sanford, 
 3 Biddeford, Alfred, Limerick and the Berwicks.  Residents in these towns represent lower socioeconomic and educational status.  The CDC tells us that families living at poverty level have the highest incidence of diabetes. Those with less education are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.  These are people that have limited resources to manage the daily activities of living with diabetes and develop more of the complications.            I would envision a diabetes education program outside of the hospital setting.  Partnering with a non-profit entity like the YWCA or town recreation departments would help reduce operational costs and increase access to the services.  The sessions could be held in multiple locations on a rotating basis.  Telehealth could be an option for some, but we need to remember many of our older people are not tech savvy and require face to face interaction.  The program should consist of an individual assessment of the person with diabetes to outline a plan for success and a written curriculum that meets the National Standards of Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support. Sessions can be individual or group.   Currently there are 183 Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (CDCES) in our state and many of them not actively working in diabetes. In conclusion, appropriation of a sum of money to fund startup costs for a diabetes education program benefits the person living with diabetes and will help to reduce the financial burden in treatment of complications.
