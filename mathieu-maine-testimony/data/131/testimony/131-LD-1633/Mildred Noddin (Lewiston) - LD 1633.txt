As a resident of Androscoggin County and a Grandparent of someone incarcerated in Maine,  
I am  respectfully  requesting your support for LD 1633 – An Act to Establish  a Community -based  
Reentry Program in all De partment  of Corrections Facilities.  
 
LD 1633 puts forth  a “Good Sense ” approach  to reentry .  Multiple  types of support for our  
returning citizens  are implemented in this plan, both prior to release and beyond  to make this  
transition  back into our communities  successful.   The recidivism rate  could  also be positively  
affected  with the implementation of LD 1633.  Thank you for your continuing service to our  
beautiful State  of Maine.  
 
Thank you for  considering my request to support LD 16 33. 
 
Sincerely  
 
 
Mildred Noddin
