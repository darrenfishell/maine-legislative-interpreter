Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and respected members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee 
l am writing to support the passing of LD1633. l am a formally incarcerated person who was 
recently released on Maine's supervised community release program. I am grateful for this 
program because it has allowed me to participate in my college graduation and reintegrate into 
my community with the support needed. 
l was released with a case plan that explained my low case management needs. While 
incarcerated, l built support, furthered my education, and developed skills within my 
community before release. l benefit from community members and peer support from inside 
MDOC. Without this support, I do not feel that I would thrive in the community l was released 
in. Connection to people who support me, value me, and relate to the struggles of reentry is 
what helps me navigate a world that feels foreign to me. This level of peer support would be 
beneficial to anyone released from MDOC custody. 
The reentry planning in Maine is supposed to begin nine months prior to a resident's release 
date. This is not always the case. MDOC case managers have high caseloads, and many 
residents are unable to advocate for their own needs. Despite MDOC's best efforts, many 
peopie are left scrambling for support prior to release. Supporting LD 1633 would help builda 
multi-dimensional plan that benefits all parties involved. Having these supports may help 
prevent recidivism, which as we all know, is a problem in Maine. Developing safety plans and 
support would also save lives. Substance use continues to be a leading killer in our 
communities. Ld1633 would offer a higher-level of support that is individualized to each person. 
Please consider this bill, on behalf of Maine communities and those who are working towards 
living a high functioning life once again. 
Respectfully, Nicole Lemay
