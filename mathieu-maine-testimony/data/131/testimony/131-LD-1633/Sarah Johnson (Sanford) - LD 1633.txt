 IN SUPPORT OF LD 1633  
An Act to Establish a Community-based Reentry Program in All Department of 
Corrections Facilities
Senator Beebe-Center, Representatives Geiger, Doudera, Gramlich, Hasenfus, 
Madigan, Matlack, Shagoury, Salisbury, and m\Honorable Members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Sarah Johnson.  I am a Software Support Specialist and I live in Sanford. 
I am a former volunteer instructor at the York County Jail (15 years) and the 
Womenâ€™s Center at the Maine Correctional Center and Southern Maine Reentry 
Center (4 years).   I recently worked in the education department at the Western New 
Mexico Correctional Facility in Grants, NM for 4 years. 
I am writing to ask for your support of LD1633 which will help provide all 
individuals the structured support and care needed for successful reentry. These 
programs would assist with the major challenges of reentry, including finding safe 
and affordable housing, finding and maintaining employment, health care, substance 
use and mental health services, parenting assistance and general transitional services. 
Reducing recidivism in Maine will have a positive effect on all citizens and 
communities. 
LD 1633 defines reentry programs based on partnerships of Corrections and 
Community programs that are evidence based with demonstrable successful 
outcomes.  
Thank you for your time and consideration of this bill, and for all your dedicated 
work.
Sarah Johnson
