I am a professor of Forensic Psychology and Criminal Justice at Thomas College. 
Previously I have worked as a forensic psychologist in the North Carolina Department
of Corrections. I saw firsthand the issue faced by those trying to reintegrate into 
society after being incarcerated. Any form of support that we can provide to these 
individuals is beneficial. I am very impressed by the format described in LD 1633 in 
terms of having a team comprised of reintegration specialists as well as peer support. 
Having a plan established and resources identified before one leaves prison will be 
very helpful in a successful reintegration. This program should be effective in 
reducing recidivism. I strongly support this bill as an important step in not only 
reintegration but also crime prevention.
