Thank you for the opportunity to be heard and it is my pleasure to support LD 1633. 
I am a formerly incarcerated woman. So, it is ﬁrsthand knowledge of the need for more reentry 
services. I started going to MPRN weekly meetings before my release. However, the only reentry 
planning that was offered was through DOC case management. 
I did everything I could to better my life while I was incarcerated. I had supportive family on the 
outside, and a stable living environment to go home to upon my release. Yet, I had no idea truly how to 
adjust to the community. I felt like I didn't belong. It felt like no one understood my struggle. It wasn't 
until the question, ”how are you doing MacKenzie" , was posed to me, in front of a large captive audience 
that I was able to be honest. ”I'm struggling ” , was all I had to say to get the support I needed. 
Because of the support I was given, I now work in reentry and recovery. I truly believe what we 
are missing in our reentry is support. Connection to other people who understand, and that know what 
we need. Regardless of criminal history, what we need is a chance to be successful. We can't expect 
people to be successful if their basic needs are not being met. The incarcerated population have huge 
barriersjust to live. When we go to prison, we "pay for our crime" . When we are released, it is not 
behind us, we continue to pay for it for the rest of our lives. We struggle with credit, housing, job 
opportunities etc. 
People who work in and around reentry know where to look when trying to ﬁnd low barrier 
resources. This is why I am in support of LD 1633. Help give people the resources they need in order to 
be successful upon their reentry. They deserve to be supported, regardless of their mistakes. If I wasn't 
given that opportunity, I would be where I am now. 
Thank you for the consideration, 
MacKenzie Kelley
