Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 25, 2023   Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, Chair Representative Suzanne Salisbury, Chair Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety 100 State House Station, Room 436 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 1633: An Act to Establish a Community-based Reentry Program in All Department of Corrections Facilities   Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public:   MACDL submits this testimony in support of LD 1633.  In order to help ensure the safety, health, and stability of our clients upon their release from prison terms, it is imperative that they are provided the supports and structure needed. If Maine truly cares about preventing crime and increasing public safety, then it will invest in the services necessary to further those goals.  Although we are always hesitant when “helping” money is controlled by the Department of Corrections, it seems that with this proposal, the DOC recognizes that community-based programs are in the best position to provide these necessary services, including recovery, housing, case management, medical care, education, employment, and more.  When people are released from prison with little more than the clothes on their back and the number for their local probation office, we should not be surprised when that person falls right back into jail. That is a policy failure. The person’s recidivism is a near guaranteed inevitability when the state has not invested the appropriate resources into ensuring that the underlying issues that led the person to incarceration in the first place are addressed.  Looking at the costs associated with this proposal, I can ensure you that anything that is being proposed is much more cost effective than reinvesting in a purely punitive model of imprisonment. For every person we assist away from re-incarceration, the State of Maine saves approximately $70,000. That is an enormous amount of money that we have been content to spend as long as it comes with prison bars and prison walls. We know better now and we need to do better now.  Thank you for your consideration, for your attention to this matter, and for allowing me to share with you all today on this important issue.                    Sincerely,                                                                     /s/ Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                              MACDL Executive Director
