When refugees come to our shores our society digs in to help them 
acclimate to life in America. Why then, do we release a person who has 
served their time in prison without acclimating them to a healthy 
lifestyle in our State? The hurdles refugees face are immense; trauma, 
poverty, language skills, education and employment challenges. Formerly 
incarcerated people face many of these same issues. 
 
The successful pilot program in Belfast, Maine has proven the value of 
integrating formerly incarcerated individuals with positive community 
experiences. The outcomes of such programs are of value financially for 
the state, socially for the local communities and personally for the 
formerly incarcerated. 
 
There is a ground swell of understanding on the national level of the need 
for change in the way we have  historically handled crime and 
incarceration. LD 1633 will put Maine on the forefront of progress and be 
a model for others. 
I hope you will support LD 1633. 
Thank you for your attention. 
 
Sincerely, Jane Herbert
