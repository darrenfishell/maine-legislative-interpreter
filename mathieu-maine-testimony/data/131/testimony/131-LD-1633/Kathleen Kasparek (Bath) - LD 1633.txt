I am writing to ask for your support to establish community-based reentry programs 
across our State.  The vast majority of incarcerated individuals will be rejoining our 
communities.  It is imperative that we institute programs to dramatically reduce 
recidivism for the benefit of the reentering citizen, their family and friends, and our 
communities at large.  The hurdles to reentering society post incarceration are HUGE.
Support for the returning citizen while incarcerated and after release is critically 
important for success.  We are not only safer as a society when recidivism is reduced, 
we also benefit from a financial standpoint ~ rehabilitation to enable the previously 
incarcerated to become contributing citizens costs far less than the ongoing cycle of 
repetitive incarceration.  Thank you for your consideration and support.
