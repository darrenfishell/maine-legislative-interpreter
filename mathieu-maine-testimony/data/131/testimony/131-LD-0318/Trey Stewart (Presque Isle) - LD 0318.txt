     Harold “Trey” Stewart III 131st MAINE SENATE 3 State House Station
     Senator, District 2 Augusta, ME 04333
Testimony of Senator Harold “Trey” Stewart
Presenting L.D. 318, Resolve, to designate the Route 170 Bridge Located in Webster 
Plantation the Gary ‘Swampy’ Worster Memorial Bridge
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation
February 21, 2023
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation: I am Trey Stewart and I have the honor of representing the people of Senate 
District 2, which includes communities in Aroostook and Penobscot counties. I am before you 
today to present L.D. 318, Resolve, to designate the Route 170 Bridge Located in Webster 
Plantation the Gary ‘Swampy’ Worster Memorial Bridge.
Recently, Gary’s sister, Gail Worster, reached out to me about naming this bridge in honor of her 
late brother who became something of a fixture within the community because of his reputation 
for consistently being seen fishing along this bridge. The Assessors of Webster Plantation said he 
was a larger-than-life personality in their small rural area and he brought a smile to the faces of 
all who knew him. Based on the accounts given, it would seem that this particular spot is a fitting 
tribute to his life and the impact he had on those around him. 
I would also like to note that Webster Plantation Assessors wrote a letter in support of this 
Resolve, which your committee analyst has received.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
