Gail  Worster
Prentiss Twp
LD 318
Hi I'm Gail Worster the sister of Gary "Swampy" Worster who passed away 
unexpectedly on April 14, 2022. The Reason why I'm asking for this particular bridge 
to be Memorialized for my brother because all of his life he fished this  area of water 
since he was a little boy with Dad, our Uncle Gary and any cousins. It just seemed to 
be his go to he loved it. I know this would mean so much to me, his three other 
siblings and his wife. We all would be so happy if this happens it's a part of our area 
up in the Northern Maine Woods and Gary called it the "Goot" short for Goudas 
which is the original name. We also try to make something good out of something bad
and our hearts have been broken for almost a year now. I know it sure would make 
the Worster Family proud. Thank you.
