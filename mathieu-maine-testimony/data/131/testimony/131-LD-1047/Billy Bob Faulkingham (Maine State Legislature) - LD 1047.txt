Testimony in Support of LD 1047 
“An Act to Adopt Eastern Daylight Time Year-round Contingent on Federal Approval ” 
Good morning Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and member of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government: 
I am Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham, and I am here to testify in favor of LD 1047, “An 
Act to Adopt Eastern Daylight Time Year-round Contingent on Federal Approval ”. 
Many of us dread the changing of the time in the spring and fall for different reasons, but one 
thing that seems to be consistent is, not many people like it. As we have evolved over time, the 
reasoning for the earlier daylight hours over the winter have become outdated. The changing of 
the clocks is antiquated and the effects on people often get overlooked. 
The effect that daylight savings time has on our mental health is one of my main concerns. 
Seasonal depression wears on us more than we think. Beginning in the fall, as we move toward 
the winter solstice the days get much shorter and with lack of outside time we tend to feel 
depressed because of the lack of daylight. As of late, mental health has been a focal point of 
everything. It is important that we continue to keep the mental health of our citizens asa 
priority. According to the National Institute of Health, sleep disruptions during the spring 
transition of daylight savings time cause the suicide rate to increase by 6.25%. In addition, the 
death rate from suicide and substance abuse combined to increase to 6.59% right after the 
change. 
Nearly every poll on this subject shows that a large majority of Americans want to end daylight 
savings time. According to an Associated Press Poll, conducted in October 2019, 71% of people 
wanted to keep their clock steady all year where only 28% of people wanted to continue 
springing forward and falling back. 
The time to do this is now, not forward, not backward, but now. 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Respectfully, 
Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham
