IN QPPOSITION TO LD 1180 
An Act to Add an Exception to the Law Regarding Intermediate 
Driver's Licenses Regarding Passengers 
Senator Chipman, Rep. Williams, and distinguished Members of the 
Ioint Standing Committee on Transportation, my name is Aaron 
Turcotte, and I am the sergeant of the State Police Traffic Safety Unit.I 
am here today to testify on behalf of the Department of Public Safety 
and the Maine State Police IN OPPOSITION or LD 1180. 
This bill would defeat the numerous ‘ gains made over the years in 
Maine regarding the graduated driver’s licenses. Drivers under 18 years 
of age are at greater risk, than older more experienced drivers, of the 
distraction caused by operating a motor vehicle while carrying 
passengers that can lead to crashes. Teens have the highest crash rate 
of any group in the US. This bill would allow a driver on their 
intermediate driver’s license to carry passengers (even non-immediate 
family members) if they are employed and have a safe driver discount 
under their vehicle insurance policy. The bill doesn’t require the driver 
to actually be working at the time of carrying passengers, but just to be 
employed, even seasonally or part time to take advantage of this

exemption. I believe most teens could demonstrate they are employed, 
to some degree, to obtain this exemption, all but removing this 
requirement altogether. This bill would have the same effect as 
repealing Title 29—A section 1311, subsection 1—A in its entirety. 
NHTSA collected data through a naturalistic driving study and 
determined that a teen driver is 2 1/2 times more likely to engage in one 
or more potentially risky driving behaviors (Speeding, following too 
closely, weaving, erratic driving, racing, showing off, etc.) when driving 
with one teenage peer compared to driving alone. When driving with 
multiple teenage peers the likelihood jumped to 3 times more likely to 
engage in risky driving behaviors. 
AAA studies have determined that since most states have enacted 
graduated driving licensing systems the teen driver fatality rates have 
been cut in half. AAA states that a teen driver, ages 16 or 17, carrying a 
passenger under 21 years of age, has a 44% increase driving risk, per 
mile driven, of being killed in a crash compared to driving solo. Having 
two passengers under 21 doubled the risk of being killed and carrying 
three or more passengers under 21 quadrupled the risk of being killed 
in a crash.‘

The CDC states the following: “The risk of motor vehicle crashes is 
higher among teens ages 16-19. than among any other age group. Teen 
drivers in this age group have a fatal crash rate almost three times as 
high as drivers ages 20 and older per mile driven. The presence of teen 
or young adult passengers increases the crash risk of unsupervised teen 
drivers. This risk increases with each additional teen or young adult 
passenger. ” ,4 
For these reasons, we urge you to vote “Ought Not To Pass” on LD 
1180. 
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State 
Police, I thank you for your time and would be happy to try and 
answer any questions that you might have.
