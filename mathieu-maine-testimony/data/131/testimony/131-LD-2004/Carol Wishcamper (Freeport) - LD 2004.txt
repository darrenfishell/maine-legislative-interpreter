House Speaker Talbot Ross, Senator Bennett, and Honorable Members of the 
Judiciary Committee:
As Co-Chair of the Maine Wabanaki State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation 
Committee (TRC), I am delighted that this Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws 
Beneficial to Wabanaki Nations is being considered.  In the TRC final report in 2015, 
we strongly recommended recognition of the rightful sovereignty of Wabanaki 
Nations.  This bill, although not restoring full sovereignty, would allow the tribes to 
benefit from most existing and future laws that apply to tribes in other states.  Unlike 
the nation's other 570 federally recognized tribes, the four tribes in Maine are 
excluded from federal laws because of unintended consequences of terms enacted in 
the Maine Indian Settlement Act of 1980.  The 151 laws enacted by Congress since 
then would help improve public health, respond to natural disasters, promote 
economic development and protect the environment.  It is right and fair to correct the 
inequities of past actions and not continue perpetuating an egregious wrong. 
Wabanaki tribe members deserve the same rights as every other federally recognized 
tribe. Thank you for acting on passage of this act that would rebalance the relationship
between the tribes, the federal government and the state of Maine. The time has come.
