LD 2004
I am testifying in support of LD 2004. The Wabanaki Nations should be automatically
included in federal legislation that affects all 570 federally recognized tribes. The 
Wabanaki should not be required to individually track all federal legislation and 
petition for inclusion in these bills. Bills that pertain to tribal nations also impact the 
rural areas surrounding them. It is not just the Wabanaki Nations, but Maine itself 
which is under-served by this exclusionary policy. Please enact this bill and recognize
the full sovereignty of the Wabanaki.
