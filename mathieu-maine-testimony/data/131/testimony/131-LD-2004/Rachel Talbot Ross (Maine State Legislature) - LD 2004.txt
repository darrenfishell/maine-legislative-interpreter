RACHEL TALBOT ROSS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
Wednesday, May 31st, 2023 
T estzmony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross presentmg 
LD 2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneﬁcial to the 
Wabanaki Nations 
Before the Jomt Standmg Commzttee on Judzczarfy 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and esteemed members of the Jo1nt 
Standmg Commlttee on Judlclary, I am Rachel Talbot Ross I represent House 
D1str1ct 118 which 1s much of the Portland penlnsula I also have the d1st1nct honor 
of servmg as the Mame Speaker of the House I am here today to lntroduce LD 
2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneﬁcial to the Wabanaki 
Nations, a b1ll that I br1ng before you w1th strong b1part1san support 
Before I begin, 1t 1s lmportant for us to all recognlze that the land we stand 
on today 1s most recently the ancestral unceded land of the Nanrantsouak Band of 
Abenak1 Ind1ans, a name meanmg “people of the st11l water between the raplds”, 
who were the last nat1ve stewards of the land between the Kennebec and 
Androscogg1n Rrvers, where they 11ved as farmers and ﬁshermen until European 
contact, when they merged 1nto the Tr1bes that make up the larger Wabanak1 
Confederacy — the Houlton Band of Mallseet Ind1ans, the M1’kmaq Natlon, the 
Passamaquoddy Tr1bes at Motahkomlkuk and S1pay1k, and the PenobscotNat1on 
The Wabanak1Nat1ons are unique, and not 1n a pos1t1ve way, among the 574 
federally recogn1zed tr1bes 1n the Unlted States due to the Ma1ne Indian Cla1ms 
Settlement Act of 1980 (MICSA, P L 96-420) 1\/HCSA provldes that any federal 
law enacted for the beneﬁt of Indlan tr1bes wh1ch would affect the appl1cat1on of 
Mame state law does not apply 1n Ma1ne and to the Wabanak1 Natlons unless the 
Un1ted States Congress explicitly makes that law appllcable 1n Mame The tr1bes 
that make up the Wabanak1 Nat1ons, the Mahseet, M1’kmaq, Passamaquoddy, and 
Penobscot, are the only federally recogmzed trlbes routmely demed the beneﬁts of 
federal leglslation that help all the other tr1bes grow, ﬂour1sh, and prosper In fact, 
under MICSA and Marne law, the Wabanak1 Natlons are not treated as natlons at 
all but rather as mun1c1pal1t1es Nelther Ma1ne nor the federal government has ever 
recogn1zedthe1r lnherent soverelgnty and 1t contmues to be 1gnored 
District 118: Portland ne1ghborhoods of Parkslde, Bayslde, East Bayslde, Oakdale and 
the Un1vers1ty of Southern Mame Campus
I have lntroduced LD 2004 to correct that h1stor1cal anomaly and glve the 
Wabanak1 Nat1ons the opportunlty to lmprove the l1ves of not only all tr1bal 
c1t1zens 1n Maine, but every person who calls the State of Mame home As I w1ll 
explaln, 1f the Wabanak1 Nat1ons are granted the beneﬁts of federal leg1slat1on that 
applles to all other tr1bes throughout the Umted States, they w1ll ﬁnally have the 
chance to bu1ld thelr tr1bal governments, engage 1n mean1ngful economlc 
development, access federal programs that were created 1n part to remedy our 
country’s h1stor1cally brutal treatment of our only Nat1ve resldents, reduce 
unemployment and poverty, and lmprove housmg and lnfrastructure VVhen the 
Wabanak1 reallze those opportun1t1es, the l1ves of Malners res1d1ng 1n com1nun1t1es 
that surround the Wabanak1 Nat1ons w1ll lmprove as well 
Dur1ng my testlmony, I Wlll refer to two pub11cat1ons that help expla1n the 
h1story of Why we have treated the Wabanak1 Nat1ons so poorly under l\/HCSA and 
Mame law, and the devastatlng consequences of that mlstreatment The ﬁrst 1s the 
report of the Task Force on Changes to the Ma1ne Ind1an Clalms Settlement 
Implementlng Act that Was 1SS1.16Cl 1n January of 2020 (The Mame Task Force 
Report whlch you can ﬁnd at 3815 (mame gov)) 
The second report was lssued 1n December of 2022 by the Harvard PI'0_]6Ct 
on Amerlcan Ind1an Econom1c Development and 1s entltled Economzc and Soczal 
Impacts of Restrzctzons on the Applzcabzlzty of Federal Indzan Polzczes to the 
Wabanakz Natzons m Mame (The Harvard Report whlch you can ﬁnd at 
wabanak1_report_v ﬁn_for_d1st_2022- 12-02 pdf (harvard edu)_)_ 
Both reports focused 1n part on the sheer volume of federal leg:lslat1on 
enacted slnce MISCA and the Ma1ne Implementlng Act came 1nto law 1n 1980 
The Ma1ne Task Force Report hsted 151 federal laws enacted after 1980 that 
beneﬁted every federally recogmzed trrbe 1n the Unlted States except the 
Wabanak1 Nat1ons (See, Appendlx N to the Ma1ne Task Force Report) Included 
1n those 151 beneﬁc1al federal laws that do not beneﬁt the Wabanak1 are laws that 
are semmal for federal Ind1an pol1cy, 1nclud1ng 
~ The Amer1can Ind1an Re11g1ous Freedom Act 
- The Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987 
~ The Esther Martlnez Nat1ve Amer1can Languages Preservat1on Act 
' The Ind1an C1v1lR1ghts Act 
~ The Ind1an Gammg Regulatory Act 
~ The Ind1an Health Care Improvement ActK
~ The Ind1an Self-Determlnatlon Act Amendments of 1988 and 1994 
~ The Ind1an Tnbal ECO1'1OI1'11C Development and Contract Encouragement 
Act 
~ The Ind1an Trust Asset Refonn Act 
~ The Natlve Amerlcan Graves Protectlon and Repatrlatlon Act 
~ The Nat1ve Amerlcan Housing Asslstance and Self-Determ1nat1on Act 
' The Safe Drlnkmg Water Act Amendments of 1986 and 1996 
' The Stafford Act 
~ The Trlbal Law and Order Act, and 
~ The Trlbal Self-Govemance Act of 2000 
The Mame Task Force concluded 
Gtven the broad nature of [the exclustonary language tn ]\4ICSA] any law 
for the beneﬁt of Indtan country that tn any way ‘aﬂects ’ Matne law may be 
rendered tnappltcable tn Matne [I]t ts theorettcally posstble that 
provtstons wtthtn each of the laws enumerated tn the report tncluded tn 
Appendtx N, may be rendered tnappltcable tn Matne tf those provtstons 
conﬂtct wtth Matne l’aw to some degree 
(Ma1ne Task Force Report at 56) Therefore, the Task Force unanlmously adopted 
Consensus Recommendatlon #20 wh1ch read 
Amend the Matne Implementtng Act to spectjy that for the purposes of §6(h) 
and §16(b) of the federal Settlement Act, federal laws enacted for the benefit 
of Indtan country do not aﬂect or preempt the laws of the State of Matne 
(Ma1ne Task Force Report at 56) LD 2004 accompllshes that and would allow the 
Wabanakl Natrons to en] oy the same nghts, pr1v1leges, powers, and 1mmun1t1es as 
every other federally recogmzed tr1be 1n the Un1ted States 
The Harvard Report begms w1th the follow1ng observatlons 
For at least the last several decades, federal Indtan poltcy tn the US has 
supported trtbal self-determtnatton through trtbal self-government The 
results have been (1) remarkable economtc growth across most of Indtan 
Country, and (2) concomttant expanstons of the responstbtltttes and 
capactttes of trtbal governments Hundreds of trtbes across the other Lower 
48 states now routtnely serve thetr cttzzens wtth the full array of 
governmental functtons and servtces that we expect from non-Indtan state
and local governments tn the US, and zncreastng numbers of trzbes are the 
economzc engznes of thezr regzons 
Unzque to Mame, the federal Mame Indzan Clazms Settlement Act of 1980 
(AHCSA) empowers the state government to block the applzcabzlzty of federal 
Indzan polzcy zn Mame As a result, the development of the Wabanakz 
Natzons ’ economzes and governmental capacztzes have been stunted Today, 
all four of the trzbes zn Mazne—Malzseet, M1 ’kmaq, Passamaquoddy, and 
Penobsc0t —are stark economzc underperformers relatzve to the other trzbes 
zn the Lower 48 states The subjugatzon of the Wabanakz Natzon ’s self- 
governzng capacztzes zs blockzng economzc development to the detrzment of 
both trzbal and nontrzbal cztzzens, alzke For the trzbal cztzzens of Mazne held 
down by AJICSA ’s restrzctzons, loosenzng or removzng those restrzctzons 
oﬂers them lzttle zn the way of downszde rzsks and but much zn the way of 
upszde payoﬂs‘ 
Agam, LD 2004 removes those ex1st1ng restrlctlons and places the Wabanakl 
Natlons on par w1th other trlbes It does so by stat1ng 1n proposed l2 M R SA 
§62l5 “that any statute or regulatlon of the Umted States enacted before, on or 
after October 10, 1980 that accords a speclal status or rlght to or relates to a spec1al 
status or r1ght of any Ind1an, Ind1an natlon, tr1be or band of Ind1ans, Ind1an lands, 
Ind1an reservatlons, Ind1an country, Ind1an terr1tory or land held 1n trust for Ind1ans 
1s appllcable W1th1n thls State, w1thout regard to any effect on the ]ur1sd1ct1on of or 
the appl1cat1on of the laws of th1s State ” Th1s w1ll allow the Wabanakl Natlons to 
become the economlc eng1nes that all of Mame desperately needs, foremost among 
them, our tnbal c1t1zens who mlght ﬁnally be able to have the opportumty to attaln 
the beneﬁts of economlc development that many other Mame people take for 
granted, and that trlbes throughout the Umted States en] oy 
The lack of the ab1l1ty for the Wabanakl to take advantage of beneﬁclal 
federal leg1slat1on and the programs establlshed by that leg1slat1on has had 
devastatmg lmpacts on the1r tr1bal c1t1zens The Harvard Report dlscussed many of 
those lmpacts 
0 Wabanakl unemployment rates are conslstently hlgher than Mame as 
a Whole When Ma1ne’s unemployment rate for all people was 4 1%, 
Unemployment for Penobscot tnbal cltlzens was 5 7%, Mal1seettr1bal 
c1t1zens was 5 8%, Passamaquoddy Ind1an ToWnsh1p trrbal c1t1zens 
was 6 5%, M1’kmaq trlbal c1t1zens was 7 5%, and Passamaquoddy
Pleasant Po1nt tr1bal c1t1zens was 8 7%, more than double Ma1ne’s 
overall rate 
0 In terms of 1ncome growth, the numbers are equally troublmg S1nce 
1989, 1nﬂat1on 21(l_]L1S1l6d 1ncome of the average res1dent of the Unlted 
States has lncreased by 17% For Ma1ners overall, mcome has 
lncreased by 25% dur1ng that t1me However, tr1bal c1t1zens 1n Mame 
have real1zed an 1ncrease of only 9% Whlle mcome for tr1bal c1t1zens 
1n the Lower 48 states, who have had the beneﬁts conta1ned 1n federal 
leg1slat1on that are den1ed to the Wabanakl, saw the1r lncome 1ncrease 
more than 61%‘ 
0 Regarding housmg, tribal citizens 1n Malne reslde 1n overcrowded 
hous1ng, wh1ch 1s deﬁned as hous1ng un1ts w1th more than one person 
per room, at rates hlgher than Ma1ne’s overall rate of 1 5% For 
Mal1seettr1bal c1t1zens that rate 1s 8 9% 
0 Ch1ld poverty rates tell a s1m1lar story, and the story 1s bleak Whlle 1n 
2019 Ma1ne’s overall ch1ld poverty rate was 15 1%, for Ind1an 
ch1ldren 1t ranged from a low of 40 2% at Passamaquoddy ’s Ind1an 
Townshlp to a hlgh of 76 9% for the M1’kmaq 
All these numbers, all of these ﬁgures are unacceptable Every number, every 
ﬁgure, represents a human berng, an Ind1an adult or an Ind1an ch1ld who 1s not able 
to reach the1r full potentlal and l1ve a l1fe ﬁlled w1th hope and d1gn1ty LD 2004 
w1ll help change those numbers, those ﬁgures, and most 1mpo1tantly, 1n so do1ng 
change so many llves for the better 
Before clos1ng, I want to po1nt out that whenever we drscuss trlbal 
soverelgnty and trlbal self-determ1nat1on, too many people focus on gamlng or 
gamblrng, as 1f those are the only economlc development tools avallable to tr1bal 
natlons and the1r tr1bal c1t1zens That 1s not the case, trlbes across the country are 
developlng the1r econom1es 1n the same ways that all governments and all people 
do They create and 1nvest 1n busrnesses that rur1 the full gamut of the larger 
economy In add1t1on, LD 2004 expl1c1tly carves out gam1ng and makes 1t clear 
that the Wabanak1Nat1ons may only conduct gamlng 1n accordance w1th the laws 
of Mame, and may not conduct those act1v1t1es under the authorlty of federal law 
or regulatron Lastly, LD 2004 also carves out the prosecutlon of Ma1ne’s lugher 
level cr1m1nal offenses by leavlng exclus1ve Jur1sd1ct1on 1n the hands of Ma1ne’s 
cr1m1nal Justlce system
I thank you very much for your t1me and attentlon today and for your 
lndulgence w1th me prov1d1ng longer than usual test1mony The length of my 
testlmony reﬂects the senousness of the 1ssues addressed 1n LD 2004 and the 
1ncred1ble amount of good we can do for so many people by movmg th1s b1ll 
forward I am happy to answer any questrons you mlght have ".4

Executuve Summary 
Lust of Laws by Congress 
Detanled Last of Laws by Congress TABLE OF CONTENTS
Executive Summary 
In October 2019, the State of Maine's Task Force on Changes to the Maine Indian Claims Settlement 
Implementing Act (“Task Force") made a request to the Human Rights and Indigenous Peoples Clinic at 
Suffolk University Law School ("Clinic") to research federal laws enacted after October 10, 1980 for the 
beneﬁt of Indians and Indian nations This report presents those research ﬁndings 
As part of the Task Force’s mandate to consider changes to the several state and federal Maine Indian 
claims settlement acts, it sought to compile a list of federal legislation enacted after October 10, 1980 
that beneﬁt Indian nations and Indians The reason for this request is that one section of the federal 
Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (”MICSA") provides that federal laws "enacted after October 10, 
1980, for the beneﬁt of Indians [or] Indian nations which would affect or preempt the application of 
the laws of the State of Maine" do not apply within the State of Maine, unless the law is specifically 
made applicable within the State 25 U S C §1735(b) Researching which laws may be implicated by 
section 1735(b), may help facilitate discussions on changes to the settlement acts 
The primary research tool utilized by the Clinic was Congress gov, which covers all federal laws The 
Clinic used different search terms, i e Indian, Native American, tribe, American Indian and tribal to 
capture the terminology used at different periods of times and to ensure that all potential laws were 
found Using the following guidelines, the research results were reviewed to determine whether to 
include a particular law in the final findings 
~ Laws which were applicable to just a specific tribe(s) were not included 
~ Laws which solely provided for the appropriation of funds under a preexisting program were not 
included 
0 If a law seemed to provide a benefit to an Indian nation or Indians, it was included 
v If a law amended an earlier law, the Clinic did not review the earlier law which was being 
amended Instead, if it seemed that the earlier law and the amendment of that law provided a 
benefit to an Indian nation or Indians, it was included 
0 If there was a question whether to include a law, the law was included 
When considering to include a law, the Clinic did not conduct a legal analysis under section 1735(_l;)_, 
namely the Clinic did not attempt to answer the question whether a law was “for the benefit of lndians 
Iorl Indian nations” and "which would affect or preempt the 3Q]IJllCEI1ZI0l'\ of the laws of the State of 
Maine " As a result, this report and its findings should not be regarded as a comprehensive list of laws 
triggered by section 1735(b), but rather a list of federal laws enacted after October 10, 1980 related to 
or which may benefit Indians and Indian nations 
The Ciinic identified approximately 151 laws covering a wide range of topics M8j0f federal Indian 
legislation was enacted or amended during this 40 year period, including the Indian Civil Rights Act, 
Indian Self-Determination Act, American Indian Religious Freedom Act, Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Indian Tribal Economic Development and 
Contract Encouragement Act, American indian Probate Reform Act, Esther Martinez Native American 
Languages Preservation Act, Tribal Law and Order Act, and the Violence Against Women Act The report 
lists all the laws by Congress, and then follows with a list of each law (again by Congress) with a brief 
description of the law and a web link to the full document

Economic and Social Impacts of Restrictions on the Applicability 
of Federal Indian Policies to the Wabanaki Nations in Maine 
by 
Joseph P Kalt, Amy Besaw Medford, and Jonathan B Taylor 
December 2022 
Executive Summary 
For at least the last several decades, federal Indian policy in the US has supported tribal self- 
determination through tribal self-goveminent The results have been (1) remarkable economic growth 
across most of Indian Country, and (2) concomitant expansions of the responsibilities and capacities 
of tribal governments Hundreds of tribes across the other Lower 48 states now routinely serve their 
citizens with the full array of governmental functions and services that we expect from non-Indian 
state and local governments in the US, and increasing numbers of tribes are the economic engines of 
their regions

trzbal citizens, alike For the tribal citizens of Maine 
held down by MICSA’s restrictions, loosening or removing those restrictions offers them little in the 
way of downside risks and but much in the way of upside payoffs 
Importantly, we ﬁnd in this study that “nowhere to go but up” also applies to the Maine state 
government and Maine’s non-tribal citizens From case after case, the pattern that has emerged under 
federal policies of tribal self-determination through self-government is one in which tribal economic 
development spills over positively into neighboring non—tribal communities and improves the abilities 
of state and local govermnents to serve their citizens As lS the case with any neighboring governments, 
conﬂicts can arise between tribal and non-tribal governments The overall experience outside of Maine 
in this regard has been that increasingly capable tribal governments improve state-tribal relations by 
enabling both parties to come to the table with mature capacities to cooperate Against these upside 
prospects 1S a status quo in which all sides leave economic opportunities on the table and ongoing 
cycles of mtergovernmental conﬂict, litigation, recrimination, and mistrust continue

Economic and Social Impacts of Restrictions on the Applicability 
of Federal Indian Policies to the Wabanaki Nations in Maine 
by 
Joseph P Kalt, Amy Besaw Medford, and Jonathan B Taylor‘ 
December 2022 
I. Should the Wabanaki Nations Be Brought Under Federal 
Policy? 
A. Maine stands out for its insulation of its tribes from federal Indian policy 
The federally recognized American Indian tribes of Maine—the Mi’kmaq Nation, Houlton Band 
of Maliseet Indians, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and Penobscot Nation—t0gether constitute the Wabanaki 
Confederacy (Wabanaki Nations, see Figure 1) 2 The Wabanaki Nations are unique among the 5 74 
federally recognized tribes in the United States due to particular provisions of the Maine Indian Claims 
Settlement Act of 1980 (l\/HCSA, P L 96-420) Speciﬁcally, MICSA provides that any federal law 
enacted for the beneﬁt of Indian tribes which would affect the application of Maine state law does 
not apply in Maine and to the Wabanaki Nations unless the US Congress explicitly makes that law 
applicable in Maine 
The key l\/IICSA clauses are referred to as “6(h)” and “16(b)” They read 
§6(h) Except as other wise [sic] provided in this Act, the laws and regulations of the 
United States which are generally applicable to Indians, Indian nations, or tribes or bands 
of Indians or to lands owned by or held in trust for Indians, Indian nations, or tribes or 
bands of Indians shall be applicable in the State of Maine, except that no law or regulatzon 
of the Unzted States (1) which accords or relates to a special status or right of or to any 
Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian

The Passamaquoddy Tribe consists of two political subdivisions —Pleasant Point and Indian Township, each of which has 
its own tribal council These combine to form the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s overall council when it is necessary to address 
pan-Passamaquoddy policy issues such as the development of Passamaquoddy land or hunting, ﬁshing, tiapping, and 
gathering rights The Passamaquoddy Tribal Court has _]lll'1SCl1ClZl0I1 over matters arising in the two communities NOTE

Some overlap |n categories may ex|st |n the federal bulls

The pC1‘1OCl encompassing federal Indlan pohcy smce at least the mld-1970s 1s wldely referred 
to as the Self-Determmatlon Era—and w1th good reason Over the perlod, federal pohcy has qulte 
conslstently, 1f not mvarlably, sought to expand and fund the scope of trlbes’ self-governmg nghts, 
resp0ns1b1l1t1es, and opportunltles (I-IPAIED, 2008, SGCETC, 2022) Not surprlslngly, then, much of 
the federal leglslatlon lmpllcated by MICSA has been pohcy adopted “for the beneﬁt of” (per MICSA, 
§16(b)) Indlan trlbes Among the 151 measures ldentrﬁed by the Task Force-commlssloned study, 
Acts readlly consldered semmal for federal Indnan pohcy mclude 
~ The Amerlcan Indlan Rehglous Freedom Act

Accordlng to the pr1nc1pal author of the Task Force-comm1ss1oned study, Suffolk Un1vers1ty 
Law School Pract1t1oner-1n-Resldence Nrcole Fr1eder1chs, not one of the 151 laws contalns expllclt 
mentlon of apphcabrhty to Mame Only the 2022 reauthonzatlon of the Vlolence Agamst Women 
Act (VAWA), Wl1lCh was passed after she completed her study, d1d so (FI‘lCd6I‘lCl'lS, 2022) 
The Mame Task Force also found 
Glven the broad nature of these prov1s1ons [the two sectlons of MICSA quoted above], any 
law for the benefit of Indlan country that 1n any way “affects” Mame law may be rendered 
lnapphcable 1n Mame For example, 1t 1s theorencally pOSSlbl6 that prov1s1ons w1th1n each 
of the laws enumerated 1n the report submltted by the Suffolk Umverslty Law School 
CllI1lC to the Task Force may be rendered mappllcable 1n Mame 1f those prov1s1ons 
conﬂlct w1th state law to some degree (e g , Carpenter et al , 2020, 56, emphasls added) 
MICSA does not deﬁne or dehneate What 1t means for a federal law beneﬁtmg Indlans to “affect” 
or “preempt” Mame state law In practlce, thls has meant that costly burdens of provmg to the contrary 
fall upon the trlbes As the Head of State of the Penobscot Natlon, Ch1efK1rk Francls of the Penobscot 
Natlon, observed to Congress, “There 1s no deﬁn1t1on for the term ‘affects’ 1n the Settlement Act, and 
the general (l6ﬁI'll'[lOI1 of the term 1s lncredlbly broad ” (F I'2ll'lClS, 2022, 3) 
Unsurprlslngly, lnterpretmg the meanlng of aﬁizcts or preempts produces conslderable uncertalnty, 
l1t1gat1on, and delay whenever Wabanakl governments tread too controverslally 1n the d1rect1on of 
state rnterest groups’ prerogat1ves Th1s has a chllhng effect on tr1bal pohcy lmplementatlon As 
Chlef Clanssa Sabattls of the Houlton Band ofMal1seetInd1ans reported to Congress,

There are scores of federal statutes that recognize a key role for tribal governments in 
administering federal programs, including in the health care, law enforcement and public 
safety, and environmental arenas But we cannot conﬁdently pursue, invest in, and staff 
these programs because we don’t know Whether—or when—the State may challenge our 
authority to admmister the programs due to some effect on state _]U.I‘lSd1CtlOI ‘l (Sabattis, 
2022, 3) 
Thus, unlike virtually all other tribes in the lower forty-eight sta1;es,3 the Wabanaki governments 
have extreme difﬁculty making use of core features of federal policies which articulate and fund tribal 
nation self-determination in the United States In this study, we seek to assess the econnomic and social 
impacts MICSA’s lnnitations on the applicability of federal Indian policy to the Wabanaki Nations 
have had and are having on the State of Maine and the Wabanaki Nations 
B. Proposals to loosen or eliminate MICSA’s limitations on the applicability 
of federal Indian policy in Maine 
Currently, Congress is considering H R 6707 Advancmg Equalzty for Wabarzakz Natzons Act 
(AEWNA) (House of Representatives, 2022) In overall effect, the bill would soften MICSA’s 
restrictions on the application of federal law to the Wabanaki Nations With respect to beneﬁcial 
federal Indian laws enacted by Congress in the future, by entirely striking the second quoted MICSA 
passage above (§16(b)), AEWNA would eliminate the requirement that future legislation speciﬁcally 
mention Maine for federal laws to apply to the Wabanaki Nations With respect to laws existing as 
of the AEWNA’s passage, the bill would modify the ﬁrst quoted section (§6(h)) with the following 
strikeouts and additions 
Lm laws and regulations of the United States 
which are generally applicable to Indians, Indian nations, or tribes or bands of Indians or 
to lands owned by or held in trust for or enacted for the beneﬁt of Indians, Indian nations, 
or tribes or bands of Indians shall be applicable in the State of Maine, except that no law 
or regulation of the United States (1) that is in effect as of the date of the enactment of the 
Advancing Equality for Wabanaki Nations Act, (2) which accords or relates to a special 
status or right of or to any Indian, Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, 
Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians, and 
alse—(2—) also (3) which affects or preempts the civil, criminal, or regulatory _|l1I'lSCllCtl0l ’l 
3In this report we focus on the Lower 48 because the suz generis policy, geography, _]llI‘lSdlC1lOl'l, and economies of Alaska 
Natives and Native Hawai’ians render them analytically distinctive for our analyses For example, though Alaska Natives 
comprise a large fraction the total state population, there is only one Alaska reservation (the Annette Island Reserve) 
analogous to the Wabanaki reservations Conversely, Maine has no equivalent to the Alaska Native Regional Corporations 
or Alaska Native Village Corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U S C §l60l et seq)

of the State of Mame, mcludrng, wrthout l1m1tat1on, laws of the State relatrng to land use 
or env1ronmental matters, shall apply w1th1n the State, unless Federal law or the State 
laws of Ma1ne provlde for the appllcatlon of such Federal law or regulatlon (H R 6707 
§2(ﬂ)(2)(B)(V)) 
We understand that the last underhned add1t1on here would effectlvely open the door for Marne to 
approve the appl1cat1on of federal Indran laws 1n Marne And lndeed, the Marne Leg1slature ’s Task 
Force, charged w1th conslderatron of the overall pubhc 1nterests of Ma1ne’s Nat1ve and non-Nat1ve 
cltlzens, concluded 1ts work as of January 2020 by calhng for the ellmlnatlon of MICSA’ s restrlctlons 
Th1s Task Force recommendatlon apphed to both future federal actlons as well as retrospectzvely to 
vrrtually every area of federal pohcy Leg1slat1on to rmplement the Tasks Force’s recommendatrons 
has been mtroduced 1n the Ma1ne Leg1slature but has not yet been enacted As noted above, AEWNA 
would advance these recommendatrons by 1ts re-wrrtmg of §6(h) to provlde that MICSA’s restrlctlons 
regardmg federal laws would apply “unless Federal law or the State laws of Mame prov1de for the 
applrcatron of such Federal law or regulat1on ” (emphas1s added) 
Whrle 1t 1s unknown what steps the Ma1ne Legrslature may take or what future federal Indlan 
legrslatlon w1ll be, the general pattern of Congress supportlng Indlan self-government has enjoyed 
b1part1san support that has enabled trlbal self-determrnatron through self-government to persrst and 
expand for decades It seems llkely to contmue The fact that several hundred tr1bes across the Unrted 
States have been operatlng for nearly ﬁfty years under federal pol1c1es recognrzrng and supportrng 
tr1bal self-determ1nat1on and economrc self-suf ﬁc1ency pr0v1des extens1ve evrdence regardlng what 
mlght be expected golng forward 1f MICSA’s l1m1tat1ons are loosened or el1m1nated 1n Wabanakl

C. Summary of ﬁndings 
There 1s a large body of research, produced by us at the Harvard Pro_|ect on Amerrcan Indlan 
Economrc Development (“the Harvard P1‘O_]CCt”) and many others, regard1ng the overall effects of 
federal pol1cy 1n the Self-Determmatlon Era The clear thrust of the ﬁnd1ngs of th1s research 1s that 
trrbal self-determlnatron through self-govermnent has resulted 1n a qurte remarkable economrc, soc1al, 
and pol1t1cal resurgence 1n Indran Country Wh1le there are some exceptrons to thls resurgence and

The strengthenmg of trlbal economles and concomltant rmprovement 1n economy-dependent soclal

not absolutely always, experlenced net beneﬁts as tr1bes have taken the re1ns of self-government and 
condltlons have 1mproved on reservatrons under Self-Determlnatlon 
As we report below, we fnd that the foregolng patterns found across the rest of at least the Lower 
48 states do not appear, or at least have been severely attenuated, 1n Mame In Sect1on II below, 
we exarmne the cond1t1ons of the Wabanak1Nat1ons relatlve to Mame as a whole We ﬁnd that the 
Wabanak1 Natlons are srgnlﬁcantly underdeveloped economlcally and 1n several soclal dll"I16I1S1Ol. ’lS 
compared to the rest of Mame In Sectlon III, we examlne the progress —or lack thereof—of the 
Wabanak1 Natlons relat1ve to the other tnbes 1n the Lower 48 1n the Self-Detemlmatlon Era, and 
we unpack the lessons be1ng learned regardlng the lmpacts of the expanslve federal pol1c1es of self- 
detennlnatlon through self-govermnent 1n other parts of the US 
Based on these lessons, 1n Sectlons IV and V we 1nvest1gate the apphcablhty of those lessons to 
Marne and the Wabanak1 Natlons The kmds of success 1n self-government and d1rect sp1llover 
development we see elsewhere are not guaranteed outcomes of loosemng MICSA’s restrlctlons on 
the applrcabllrty of federal pohcy to the Wabanak1 Natlons Such pohcy change would carry r1sks 
and opportunltles for reward for the Wabanak1 Natlons and the State of Mame As we report 1n 
Sectlon IV, however, we do not ﬁnd bases for concludlng that the Wabanak1 Natlons confront 
lnherent or lmmovable obstacles that would lmpede their ab111t1es to reallze the kmds of outcomes 
reahzed by many other tnbes that operate under cond1t1ons of s1ze, locatlon, access to resources, 
educatlon, and the llke s1m1lar to those faced by the Wabanak1 Natlons What we can say 1s that, 
w1thout the loosenmg of MICSA’s restnctlons, both the Natlons and the state should expect 
contlnued relatlve depresslon of the tnbes’ CCOIIOIIIIC fortunes and capacltles to generate beneﬁclal 
sprllovers for thelr nelghbors 
In Sectlon V, we ﬁnd that 1t would be lmproper to cast the prospect of extendmg federal Indlan 
pol1c1es that support Wabanak1 self-determmatron and self-government as carrylng negatlve 
consequences for non-Natlve nelghbors Based on the evldence generated by expenences 1n other 
states (where federal pOl1C16S are more completely applled), real and rmaglned problems of, for 
example, state government/trlbal government eonﬂlct, contradlctory laws or regulatlons, adverse 
budgetary lmpacts on the state and non-tnbal local governments, and the llke are erther already 
present under the MICSA status quo, or are the kmds of 1ssues that nelghbonng and overlappmg 
govemments —tr1bal and non-trrbal--routrnely work out through cooperatlon, col1aborat1on, and

intergovermnental agreement On the other hand, the likely outcome of sticking with the status quo 
1S the status qu0—1 e , economic beneﬁts for Maine’s non—tribal and tribal citizens “left on the table” 
and continued rounds of MICSA-driven conﬂict, litigation, and acrimony between the state 
government and the tribes 
II. The Economic and Political Condition of the Wabanaki 
Nations Under MICSA 
A. Economic conditions: Maine’s Wabanaki citizens lag behind the rest of 
the state’s citizens 
Let us now examine the conditions of the Wabanaki Nations relative to Mame as a whole and 
relative to other tribes that operate more completely under the federal government ’s policies of tribal 
self-determmation through self-government Table 1 shows US Census data from the 2019 
American Community Survey (ﬁve-year average) The Wabanaki Nations lag behind in a variety of 
key socioeconomic indicators For example, Wabanaki per capita income for individuals identiﬁed 
in the Census as American Indian Alaska Native (AIAN) Alone‘ is markedly lower than the amiual 
per capita income of all people in Maine 5 Maliseet and Mi’kniaq are the lowest with $11,320 and 
$11,431, respectively Passamaquoddy ’s two areas, Indian Township and Pleasant Point, are 
$14,435 and $13,741 Penobscot ’s per capita income for AIAN—the highest for the Wabanaki 
Nations—is $18,809 Yet Maine’s per capita income 1S nearly double that at $34,593 
When we examine poverty rates in the Wabanaki Nations relative to those for Maine as a whole, 
the implications of lower incomes in the former are particularly stark Focusing, for example, on child 
poverty (children under 18 in households with incomes below the poverty level) the US Census data 
mdicate ﬁve-year average poverty rates for 2019 ranging from a low of 40 2% at Passamaquoddy ’s 
Indian Township to a high of 76 9% at Mi’kmaq By comparison, Maine’s child poverty rate for the 
same period 1S reported as 15 1% 
4 “Alone” signiﬁes single-race identity 
5Unless denoted by nomznal or with a year (as in, 1998 dollars), all the dollar ﬁgures in this report are denominated in 
2021 dollars ﬂ(.l_]I.lSt €(l for inﬂation using the consumer price index for urban consumers, CPI-U (FRED, 2022) When 
ieferring to Indian data derived from the US Census, this report uses the Census’s evolving nomenclature, particularly 
“Indian,” “American Indian and Alaska Native,” and “American Indian and Alaska Native Alone ” Respondents to the 
census questioner or questionnaire self-identify

The overall picture is clear The Wabanaki Nations are quite systematically economically 
underdeveloped relative to the rest of Maine This is certainly felt as relative deprivations in the 
reservation communities in which many of Maine’s tribal citizens live and work It would also be 
expected that the condition of the Wabanaki Nations and its tribal citizens redounds to the detrmient 
of the state of Maine and its non-tribal citizens Poverty and attendant social strains in the 
reservation communities not only burden state budgets and social services but the state’s economy as 
well The unemployed, but employable, worker and ll1'ldCl ‘dCV6lOpCd local goverrnnent —tribal in this 
case—would be spending more in Maine’s local markets if that worker were able to ﬁnd work and 
that government were able to increase service provision to its citizens We now turn to the question 
of the sources of the Wabanaki Nations’ relative economic underdevelopment 
B. Political conditions: Maine is an outlier in its policies and relations with 
the state’s tribes 
The consequence of MICSA’s blocking federal Indian legislation of general applicability is tribal 
governments that are strikmgly underfunded and Jurisdictionally constrained relative to their tribal 
counterparts elsewhere in Indian Country A few examples make the limitations clear 
Consider, for example, disaster and emergency declarations Tribes elsewhere have the power to 
appeal directly to the federal government for disaster relief funds under the 2012 Stafford Act 
amendments and respond quickly to on-reservation emergencies Resulting funding typically 
beneﬁts the receiving tribe but also has spillover beneﬁts to the non-tribal neighbors of the tribe 
MICSA’s restrictions have blocked the Wabanaki Nations’ abilities to directly secure federal 
funding Instead, Wabanaki emergency response must enter the state’s queue with attendant delays 
and even the possibility of gubernatorial I‘6_]CCtlOI1 Presumably, in a general emergency, Maine 
would beneﬁt from its quite reasonable prioritization of population clusters of Portland, Lewiston, 
and Bangor and, all else equal, from additional emergency funds ﬂowing to Mi’kmaq, Maliseet, 
Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy communities (Francis, 2022) 
A similar story applies to the Wabanaki Nations’ efforts to protect their citizens from non-Indian 
abusers The Penobscot Tribe was an advocate for passage of the federal Safezfy for Indian Women 
title of the 2013 amendments to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Upon passage of the 
amendments, the Tribe sought federal funding wider a Department of Justice program for the 
Penobscot Court to be an implementation pilot for better processes for non—Ind1an offenders who 
commit domestic violence, dating violence, or protective order violations Maine’s invocation of 
§16(b) of IVIICSA ended the effort Millions in federal inﬂows to Penobscot (and therefore Maine) 
went elsewhere, to say nothing of the consequences for the people needing protection from abusers

After that I'6_]€CtlOn, Penobscot pushed for Congress to exphcrtly 1nclude Mame in VAWA After 
great expense and n1ne years of pressure and wa1t1ng, the 2022 VAWA amendments were made 
appllcable to the Wabanakl Natlons (Francls, 2022) Whrle the effort was successful, Penobscot (and 
the other Wabanak1Nat1ons) face barrlers to access that most other trlbes s1mply do not 
L1l{6W1S6, the old school at Pleasant Po1nt (Szpayzk) had to proh1b1t 1ts students from drlnklng from 
water fountams because the water supply was so toxlc A new school was burlt on reservatlon lands 
1n 2021 uslng federal Bureau of Indlan Educatlon (BIE) funds and needed a better water supply The 
trlbe dug a well on the reservatlon to provlde water for the dr1nk1ng fountalns and kltchen, only to 
have the State Attorney General’s ofﬁce mtervene to say that the tr1be and the school would need state 
approval before usmg the well A memorandum of understandlng had to be negotrated and slgned 
w1th the state to do what, 1n most other Indlan school constructron p1‘O_]CCtS, would be a matter of local 
trlbal self-government 
The most notable consequence of federal pollcy 1n the Self-Determlnatlon Era has been to glve 
tnbes the opportun1ty to-—and the respons1b1l1ty for—prov1d1ng servlces to therr cltlzens Improved 
econom1c condltlons under self-determlnatlon (see below) have resulted 1n trlbes heavlly 
augmentlng thelr governmental budgets wlth thelr own ﬁlnds (typ1cally from resource revenues, 
enterprlse earnmgs, and 1n a growlng number of cases, trlbal taxes) 
Today, especlally Where econom1c development has progressed sufﬁc1ently, trrbal governments 
commonly supply (or pay nelghbormg governments to supply) the full range of servlces and 
functlons that are expected of any competent state and local system Th1s means everythmg from ﬁre 
departments, pol1ce ofﬁcers, courts, and lncarceratron fac1l1t1es to trash collect1on, water and sewer, 
roads, parks, housmg, educatron, env1romnental protectlon, resource stewardshlp, substance abuse 
and v1olence preventlon, and myrlad other servlces Tr1bes such as the Confederated Sahsh and 
Kootenal Trrbes of the Flathead Reservat1on, for example, were the ﬁrst tnbe to become a 100% 
self-governance tr1be (1 e , entlrely eschewlng servlce pI'OVlSl0I1 by federal agenc1es (HPAIED, 
2003b)) 
In a growlng number of lnstances, trlbes’ own revenue sources now dwarf federal sources 1n thelr 
trlbal govemment budgets For example, 1n Washmgton State, 23 tnbes collect1vely Cl.BI'1VCd more than 
three-quarters of trlbal government fund1ng 1n 2019 from enterprrse d1str1but1ons, tribal taxes, leases, 
stumpage, and other tr1bally controlled or owned sources Only 18 percent came from federal grants 
and contracts and 4 percent came from Washmgton-funded grants or contracts (Taylor, 2022, 22) And 
trlbes no longer look to the federal govemment for approval of every ma] or declslon they WlSl’l to make 
The result of th1s 1s that self-governmg trlbes can often streamhne dec1s1on-maklng and respond to 
communlty needs faster and more efﬁcrently than the federal govemment or state and local nelghbors

Scores of such cases across hundreds of tribes have been well documented (HPAIED, 2022) While 
oft-noted tensions between the Wabanaki Nations and the state tell us that the governments of the 
Wabanaki Nation aspire to perform well for the beneﬁt of their citizens, the process has been attenuated 
in Mame by the hurdles MICSA erected for the tribes 
Fmally, as We discuss m detail below, in addition to improved goverrunental perfonnance, one 
of the critical payoffs to tribes (and their neighbors) of Congress ’s Indian legislation in the years 
since MICSA has been strong and steady economic development and tribal government growth As 
we have seen, however, the Wabanaki Nations are notable for their absolute and relative economic 
underdevelopment Thus, it is appropriate to inquire as to whether the State and the tribes might be 
better off by ending the anomalies introduced by MICSA and brmging Ma1ne’s policies vis-a-vis the 
Wabanaki Nations into line with the policies goveming the American Indian nations in the other 47 
of the Lower 48 states 
III. Lessons From Tribes in the Other Forty-Eight States 
A. Indian Country has experienced extraordinary economic growth in the 
Self-Determination Era 
While there are exceptions, the overall pattern that has emerged outside of Maine for most tribes 
and Indian citizens on reservations in the Lower 48 states under the federal framework of tribal self- 
determination through local self-govemment 1S one in which that framework has produced sustained 
economic development The Self-Determmation Era has brought sustained economic growth across 
large numbers of communities that struggled for a hundred years or more to get any development 
To see these trends, we can look to US Census data on income per person Per capita income is 
certainly not the be-all, end-all measure of Native economic success As with societies worldwide, 
matters such as family integrity, ﬂourishing arts, health, safe and clean enviromnents, long lives, and 
a host of other values combine to determine the quality of life Nevertheless, per capita income does 
matter and provides a good approximation for “gross reservation product’ ’—a foundational contributor 
to quality of life7 
7Gross product is the sum of all value added in an economy, and we use gross reservation product to refer to the sum 
of all value added in Indian Country economies In large, diversiﬁed economies such as the United States’ , personal 
income 1S the lion’s share of gross product Variation arises in smaller economies to the extent that other sources of value- 
added, such as proprietor income (e g , proﬁts and ients) and natural resource revenues, diverge from national pattems for 
idiosyncratic reasons US national income accounts do not record gross reservation product statistics for Indian Coinitry

Though the start of the Self-Deterrmnatron Era 1s commonly demarcated by the 1975 passage of 
the Indran Self-Determmatron and Educat1onalAss1stance Act (P L 93-638), the econom1c effect of 
the federal change 1n stance from trrbal termlnatron polrcy (an approach that prevarled from WWII 
unt1l then) to self-determlnatron drd not lmmedrately regrster 1n Ind1an communrty l1fe Asa 
prehmrnary matter, that 1n1t1al legrslatron only meant that trrbal governments could only start to take 
over another govemment ’s (1 e , the federal govemment ’s) programs Th1s was to be done by 
contract1ng wrth the federal govemment to become the mere admlnlstrators of functrons long 
performed on reservatlons by federal agencles (such as the Bureau of Ind1an Affa1rs) —-but strll 
operatmg under the federal goven1ment ’s pr1or1t1es, procedures, and systems The rdea was that 
trlbes could contract and recerve roughly the same dollars as the federal provlder for the same work, 
often by the same people 
Unfortunately for trrbes, thrs "step-1nto-the-federal-shoes ” approach was l1m1ted by a ﬁscal 
retreat that saw federal budgets cut for trrbal functrons, whether performed by trlbes who drd contract 
to provrde those ﬁmct1ons or by federal agencles 1n thelr hrstorrc pre-self-determlnatron roles 
Federal budgets dlrected toward Ind1an matters peaked 1n the Carter Admmrstratron, and reductrons 
1n federal fundlng were accelerated under Presrdent Reagan (Walke, 2000, 236) The budget declrnes 
1n the second half of the 1970s and the Reagan years 1n the 1980s occurred when Ind1an reservatron 
payrolls and expendrtures were stlll domlnated by federal agencles and programs (Trosper, 1996) 
The result was an actual declrne 1n the real (1 e , lnﬂatron-adjusted) per caprta mcomes of Indrans 
l1v1ng on reservatrons between the 1980 US Census and the 1990 US Census (see, Taylor and Kalt, 
2005) Economrc and socral progress had to wart for true trrbal self-government- —as opposed to 
mere admrmstratron of federal programs —to take hold 
Respondmg to expressrons of frustratlon over constramts on the1r ab1l1t1es to adapt programs to 
local needs by trlbal govermrlents who were tryrng or wanted to try to contract to run federal 
functrons and encouraged by the success of some prlot efforts allowlng greater scope for trlbal 
government dec1s1on-maklng, Congress slgnrﬁcantly amended the 1975 Self-Determlnatron Act 1n 
1988 (P L 100-472, 102 Stat 2285) Congress mandated more cooperatron and aggressron on the 
part of federal authorrtres 1n assrstlng trrbes 1n takmg over federal functlons, and the Amendments 
mandated a prlot program of self-governance Thrs marked the start of a sh1ft away from the 
excluslve dependence of trrbes on the contractmg model to the eventual use of “compacts ” between 
trrbes and the federal government, wrth negotrated compacts provldlng trlbal governments wrth 
expanded leeway for detenmnmg pr1or1t1es, desrgnrng programs, and allocatrng budgets

Reﬂectmg successes 1n the p11ot efforts, self-govemance and self-governance compacts becamea 
wave—susta1ned through today——w1th the passage m 1994 of another set of II18._]OI ‘ amendments to the 
1975 Self-Detenn1nat1on Act (P L 104-413, 108 Stat 4250) Th1s wave has only been pushed onward 
over the years by scores of Congresslonal, presldentlal, and agency act1ons wh1ch have bolstered 
the powers of tr1bes to make thelr own dec1s1ons of the1r own affalrs 8 It 1s now de rzgueur, for 
example, that federal leg1slat1on affectmg states v1a allocat1ons of mon1es and author1t1es prov1de 
blanket treatment of “tr1bes as states” (or TAS)—1 e , allocatlng funds and delegatmg federal powers 
to tr1bes equ1valent to those en] oyed by the states Of course, unless expl1c1tment1on1s made of Mame, 
such Congresstonal prov1s1ons of TAS status are generally mappllcable to the Wabanakl Nat1ons of 
Ma1ne 1f they affect state ]ur1sd1ct1on 1n any way, as a result of §6(h) and §16(b) 
By the end of the 1980s, econom1c development 1n Ind1an Country began to take root as tr1bes 
bu1lt enterprlses 1n, for example, sk1 tourlsm, llght Defense Department manufactur1ng, forestry and 
w1ldl1fe management, hvestock and crop agrrculture, and gammg And, to be sure, 1n one of the most 
apparent and economrcally potent examples of expanded tr1bal self-govemment and of Congress 
treatlng trlbes akm to states 1n terms of governmental powers, the passage of the Ind1an Gam1ng 
Regulatory Act (IGRA 25 U S C §2701, et seq) 1n 1989 freed tr1bal governrnents —l1ke the1r state 
counterparts w1th thelr state lotterres- —-to (substantlally) control the dec1s1on whether gam1ng 
enterpnses would be allowed to operate w1th1n trlbal natlons 
W1th contract1ng and compact1ng prov1d1ng tralnmg grounds for tr1bal ofﬁcrals and 
admrmstrators, w1th lmproved performance and leg1t1macy created by sh1ft1ng accountab1l1ty from 
masters located m the federal government to tr1bal c1t1zens 1n the local commun1ty, and w1th doors 
opened to opportun1t1es 1n the econom1c arena, a remarkable per1od of susta1ned econom1c 
development took hold 1n Ind1an Country 1n the late 1980s (Cornell and Kalt, 2010) Th1s econom1c 
development can be seen 1n F1gure 3, whlch allows a compar1son of the growth m per cap1ta mcome 
of AIAN resldents of reservat1ons 1n the Lower 48 states (except Marne) from 1989 to the present to 
the growth 1n per cap1ta 1ncome of average c1t1zens across the Un1ted States9 
8The aforement1oned study comm1ss1oned by the Task Force provldes summar1es of many of these act1ons (see also, House 
of Representat1ves, 2022) 
9In F1gure 3 as 1n several upcomlng ﬁgures rel1ant on data from the US Census Bureau, the bulk of the exper1ence of 
the tr1bes of Oklahoma 1s not reﬂected At least unt1l the US Supreme Court’s dec1s1on 1n McGzrt v Oklahoma, 140 
S Ct 2452 (2020), the c1t1zens of most Oklahoma Ind1an tr1bes were categonzed as res1d1ng 1n what the Census calls 
Oklahoma Tr1bal Stat1st1cal Areas (OTSAs) rather than belng categonzed as res1d1ng on reservat1ons (the Osage Nat1on 
be1ng a prom1nent except1on) OTSAs encompass the majonty of the land areas of the state, mcludmg the h1stor1c 
reservat1ons of the Cherokee, Ch1ckasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Semrnole Nat1ons 1n eastern Oklahoma, 
wh1ch 1ncludes downtown Tulsa As Taylor a11d Kalt observed, “Oklahoma trlbes’ governmental powers and the 
soc1oeconom1c cond1t1ons 1n the “Ind1an areas” of Oklahoma often bear a closer resemblance to, say, downtown Duluth 
(ln the case of Ind1ans l1v1ng 1n Tulsa) or rural M1ssour1 (a state w1th no reservat1ons) than they do to the more prototyplcal 
Crow, G1la R1ver, or P1ne Rldge reservat1ons ” (Taylor and Kalt, 2005, X)

B. Is it all about casinos? 
It m1ght seem senslble to conjecture that the expans1on of the tr1bal gammg 1ndustry smce 1989 
explams the qu1te strong growth trajectory of tr1bes outslde of Mame that we see 1n F1gure 3 And 
1t mlght be conjectured that Ma1ne’s lack of Ind1an casmos explalns the d1fference 1n growth rates 
between the Wabanakl Natlons and other tr1bes 1n the Lower 48 Ne1ther conjecture 1s accurate 
It 1s undoubtedly true that the expanslon of the tr1bal gam1ng lndustry has contr1buted 
substant1ally to 1mprov1ng the econom1c cond1t1ons exper1enced on hundreds of reservat1ons (not to 
ment1on those exper1enced 1n ne1ghbor1ng non-Ind1an communltles) The hypothesls that the growth 
of tnbes’ 1ncomes seen s1nce 1989 1s sunply the result of the appearance and growth of the tubal 
gam1ng 1ndustry overlooks two key factors the experlence of non-gamlng trlbes and the economlc 
growth occurr1ng 1n non-gamlng sectors of tr1bal economres 
Concermng tr1bes lack1ng gammg enterpr1ses, the decade of the 1990s provldes a natural 
exper1ment by wh1ch to assess the contrlbutlon of gam1ng to tnbes’ 6COl'lOIl ’llC development The

percent of Natlve Amerlcans res1d1ng on reservatlons hved on reservatlons whose trlbe d1d not own

Lower 48 reservatrons outside Oklahoma (Taylor and Kalt, 2005, 11) 
As Taylor and Kalt observed regardmg Indxan SOCIOCCOIIOITIIC change 1n the 1990s, measured 
across per caplta mcome, medlan mcome, and a dozen other lndrcators 
the progress [relatlve to the Unlted States] evldent among non-gamlng tnbes 1n the 
1990s suggests that 1t 1s not so much gamlng that 1s dr1v1ng the soc1oeconomic changes 
evldent across Indlan Amerlca as 1t 1s a broader pohcy of Indlan self-government 
Jur1sd1ct1on over the gamlng cholce 1s part, but hardly the entlrety, of that pohcy 
(Taylor and Kalt, 2005, xx) 
The lesson 1s that gammg was but one mamfestatlon of enhanced powers and opportumtles for 
trlbal self-government 1n the 1990s As self—governance took root 1n the late 1980s, trlbes falrly 
exploded wrth CXp3.I‘lS1011S of both therr governmental and non-govemmental (1 e , busmess)

Sect1on 2) The growth of these sectors was not due to some reklndled largess on the part of the 
federal government Over 1990-2000, for example, the federal Bureau of Ind1an Affalrs’ budget 
decllned by 3% 1n real, ll'lﬂ3tl0I‘1-3.(1_]l1S1l6d dollars 1° 
By companson, federal grants to state and local 
govemments have been stead1ly and rap1dly expandlng slnce the 1970s (Lawhorn, 2019) 
More generally, the federal government ’s Comm1ss1on on C1v1l Rlghts 2003 report, A Quiet 
Crzszs Federal F undmg and Unmet Needs zn Indzan Country, “documented the federal 
government ’s h1stor1c fa11ure to carry out 1ts promlses and trust obhgatlons [to trlbes] These fa1lures 
lncluded longstandmg and contlnumg dlsregard for trlbes’ lnfrastructure, self-govemance, housmg, 
educatlon, health, and economlc development ” (Berry et al , 2003, 6) Overall, federal spend1ng per 
person on Natlve Amencan US c1t1zens was only 1IWO—1lh1I'dS of the spendlng on the average US 
c1t1zen In health, the comparable ﬁgure was 50%, 1n educat1on, trrbal fundmg was only 50%-60% of 
the federal total spent on malnstream educatron In the cr1m1nal _]llStlCC arena, federal expendltures 
on law enforcement 1n Indlan Country were only 80% of the level devoted to demographlcally 
comparable non-Indlan commun1t1es In the C0mII1lSS1OI1 on C1v1l Rlghts’ update of 1ts 2003 report 
1n 2018, the Comm1ss1on found that 
S1nce 2003, fundmg for Natlve Amerlcan programs has mostly remalned ﬂat, and 1n the 
few cases where there have been mcreases, they have barely kept up w1th 1nﬂat1on or have 
actually resulted 1n decreased spendmg power (Lhamon et al , 2018, 4) 
Today, the vast ma]or1ty of tr1bes have opted to operate gammg enterprlses Even after 2000, 
however, the growth trajectory 1n F1gure 4 cannot be adequately seen as a gam1ng phenomenon 
alone If anythmg, reports of gammg markets bemg saturated, coupled w1th very raprd growth of 
non-gammg busmesses 1n Indlan Country, re1terate that 1t has been self-determlnatlon through 
self-govemment that has turned around the dlscouragmg results of earller decades—~1 e , decades 1n 
WhlCh someone else (usually the federal government) was “1n the dr1ver’s seat” when 1t came to 
runmng reservatlon affalrs Indeed, Indlan Country today 1s mcreasmgly dlverslﬁed away from 
dependence on gammg, wlth numerous tnbes operat1ng trlbal manufacturlng, tourlsm, agncultural, 
extractlve, retall, ﬁnanclal, constructlon, commumcatlons, and transportatlon enterprlses that more 
than hold thelr own 1n competltlve markets (see, e g , HPAIED, 2008) 
1°The Bureau’s budget 1n 2000 was $2 1 b1ll1on (Bureau of Indlan Affalrs, 2000), compared to $1 499 b1ll1on 1n 1990 
(Bureau of Indlan Affalrs, 1990) Over the penod from Q1 1990 to Q1 2000, the GNPP Deﬂator rose 23 4% (FRED,

Further evidence that the initial 1980s’ economic growth and the sustained growth since in 
Indian Country is a product of self-governance generally —rather than 
self-governance-manifested-through-gaming —is found m the distribution of Native reservation 
citizens across tribes with gaming operations Data from 1998 collated by the Associated Press 
revealed that tribal populations and revenues of gaming operations were skewed in opposite 
directions (Figure 5)—meaning that large gaming operations were found in tribes with small 
populations and vice versa

“Percentages do not sum to 100 percent because some tribes have gaming operations in more than one category" HPAIED (2008b) citing 
the Associated Press (2000)                     
As Figure 5 indicates, 56 percent of the revenues ($4 63B) were eamed by tribes accounting for 
only 5 1% of Indian Country’s citizens, and 5 percent of the revenues ($0 41B) were earned by casinos 
of tribes that accounted for more than half the tribal citizen population In addition, “Approximately 
32 percent of Indians are members of tribes that do not have any gaming operations ” (HPAIED, 2008, 
150) With the Il'l3_]OI'llZy of tribal citizens being on reservations with little or no gaming revenues, the 
growth in the average tribal citizen’s income we see in the 1990s cannot be attributed to gaming 
The pattern of concentration seen in 1998 continues to hold today Figure 6 shows the gaming 
revenue distribution reported by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) in 2021 The top 
43 facilities (8%) collectively earned more revenue ($20 4 billion) than the other 467 combined The 
smallest three-quarters of facilities collectively eamed $6 6 billion, and the smallest half of facilities 
earned $1 5 billion collectively Figure 6 below displays the evolution of this quartile —the blue shaded 
region between the 50th (median) and 75*“ percentiles

The cumulative revenues for the percentiles are estimated from the ad|acent data by log-linear interpolation (NIGC, 2021) 
This concentration of gaming revenues undermines the hypothesis that gaming is driving the 
overall growth of the income of the average reservation Native citizen The per capita income 
reported for Indians living on reservations in Figures 3 and 4 is the population-weighted average of 
per capita Indian income As such, it reports how much income the average Indian living ona 
reservation earned All else equal, if a small tribe located in the top tier in Figure 5 or 6 experienced 
a vast increase in per capita income, it would not move the Indian Country average much because 
much larger on-reservation Native populations per the Census (such as those of the White Mountain 
Apache Tribe, pop 15,000, the Oglala Sioux Tribe, 17,000, or the Navajo Nation, 166,000) would 
tend to dominate the weighted average (Census, 2020a) In other words, the good fortunes of a small 
number of tribes cannot explain the growth trajectory in Figure3 
C. Diversiﬁcation and the growth of non-gaming economic activity 
As suggested above, a further reason that the “it’s-all-gaming ” hypothesis misses the mark in 
explaining three decades of economic growth in Indian Country 1S that it overlooks evidence of 
reservation economies ’ non-gaming business and governmental activity For decades, Indian tribes 
have earned revenues from coal, oil, gas, timber, hydropower, and other natural resources As tribes 
grow in sophistication, their economies diversify —n0t _]l1SlI from a gaming starting point (e g,

Of course, Sectlon 8(a) procurement revenues and mmeral royalt1es drsplay concentratlon, too 
For example, the Sectlon 8(a) subs1d1ar1es of the Wmnebago TI‘lbC of Nebraska ’s Ho-Chunk, Inc 
make 1t a Lower 48 procurement powerhouse The Southern Ute economy beneﬁts from SlZ3.blC San

royalt1es, taxes, and tnbal employment 1n coal mmmg 
Under self-detemnnatlon, econom1c d1vers1ﬁcat1on takes on many ﬂavors For example, the 
Tulallp Trlbes’ upscale outlet shoppmg mall and “b1g box” stores at thelr Qull CedaV1llage north of 
Seattle generate large (relatlve to trrbal populatlon) lease and tax revenues, as well as provlde trrbal 
and non-trrbal employment 1n the mun1c1pa1 departments that support the I‘6lI8.1l operatlons (HPAIED, 
2003a) The I-Iualapa1 Tr1be’s Grand Canyon West venture hosts more than one 1'1’lLlllOIl slghtseemg 
tourlsts annually at 1ts famous Skywalk attractlon overlookmg the Grand Canyon (Kalt, 20170) Fort 
Belknap’s Island Mountaln Development Group’s s1x for-proﬁt constructlon and ﬁnanclal servlces 
compames generate combmed annual revenues well 1nto mne ﬁgures and support close to 500 jobs 
(IMDG, 2021) The Sahsh and Kootenal Tr1bes of the Flathead reservatlon own and operate at least 
eleven companles 1n the electron1cs, aerospace, and defense contractlng sectors, supportmg hundreds 
of dlrect and lndlrect jobs 1n rural Montana—where 1t 1s commonly thought that econom1c 
development 1s nearly lII1pOSSlblC (S&KT, 2022) 
Examples lrke these, and many others slmply dld not exlst before trlbes took the 
self-determmatlon rems Instead, before self-determlnatlon, development efforts tended to followa 
so-called “standard model” 1n whlch trlbes chased——somet1mes desperately ——whatever the federal 
govemment was fundmg 1n a partrcular budget cycle Moreover, project management was typlcally 
vested 1n the trrbal councnls by federal authonues, who usually seemed unable to rmagme tnbes 
bemg able to create thelr own busrness laws and buslnesses In the same ve1n, federally funded 
development projects were often undertaken upon meetlng bureaucratlc cntena rather than through 
conslderatlon of underlymg econom1c feas1b1l1ty or management and stafﬁng capacrtles Research 
ﬁnds that tnbal econom1c enterprrses burlt on the “standard model” have been about ﬁve tlmes more 
llkely to fall than when they are founded on tnbes’ adoptlng modem models that provrde msulatlon 
from pol1t1cs and performance measures (Cornell and Kalt, 2007) 
The pomt of Frgure 7 1s not to fully charactenze the vanatlon and dlverslty of trrbal econom1c

areas Trlbal convemence stores, malls, hquor stores, and other retarl busmesses eam proﬁts and pay 
wages And, of course, the net mcome of all trrbally owned busrnesses goes to support the payrolls 
and expendrtures of what had been, before the Self-Determmatlon Era, chromcally underfunded trlbal 
governments (Berry et al , 2003, Lhamon et al , 2018) 
Federal pol1c1es of self-determmatlon through self-government have themselves, drrectly spurred 
reservatlon economrc development As d1scussed above, the 1988 and 1994 amendments to the 
Self-Determlnatlon Act of 1975 permlt trlbes to go beyond merely conlractmg on-reservat1on federal 
functrons and lnstead compact multlple federal programs 1n a quasl-block-grantrng arrangement 
Th1s dlrectly supports employment and wages and 1s augmented by 1nclud1ng federal regronal and 
natronal overhead budgets 1n the compacts wlth the tnbes All told, these amount to substantral 
lmpulses to gross reservatlon product A pre-pandemlc survey of 23 Washlngton trlbes sheds llght 
on the shares of gammg, non-gammg, and governmental economlc actlvrty In that state, those 23 
trlbes reported 16,735 gammg employees, 3,606 employees 1n non-gammg busmesses, and 7,152 
trlbal government employees (Taylor, 2022) 
In addrtron, as trrbal natlon economles become more dlverslﬁed, growth tends to bulld 1ts own 
momentum For example, Indlan Country growth 1s startmg to loosen trlbal l1qu1d1ty constramts, 
thanks to enterprlse proﬁts and royaltles For example, gammg cashﬂows helped lower the Squaxrn 
Island Tr1be’s cost of borrowlng from many pomts above prlme to one pomt above prlme (Taylor, 
2006) Early 1n the self-determmatlon process, Cltrzen Potawatomr took control of 1ts ﬁnanclal 
assets and mcreased the return earned on those assets by more than 300% (GAO, 2019) Reductlons 
1n ﬁnanclng costs and lmproved asset returns of these types can turn the net present values of 
marglnal lnvestment opportunrtres from negatrve to pos1t1ve, makmg even more economrc 
development attractlve 
Human capltal accumulatlon also adds momentum to reservatron economres If a trrbe blll1dS 
a La Qumta Inn and 1ts c1t1zen-employees learn from the franchrsor how to manage staff, manage 
procurement, and conduct the mght audrts, that experlence can later be redeployed 1n the tr1be’s 8(a) 
defense manufacturmg company or the trlbal government ’s roads department Such vlrtuous cycles 
encompass trrbal governments as well The Wlnnebago Tr1be’s Ho-Chunk, Inc , for example, not only 
pays a d1v1dend to 1ts owner-government and pays trlbal taxes, cr1t1cally for the reservatron economy, 
1t also makes downpayment assrstance avallable to mrddle-class fam1l1es who want to own a house on 
the reservatlon and work 1n trrbal enterprrse or government (Goss and Straln, 2019) Fort Belknap’s

that thls 1s largely the result of the restrrctlons of the Mame Indran Clalms Settlement Act on the

very least, these restrrctlons have llmrted the ab1l1ty of the Wabanak1Nat1ons to at least get on paths

Lastly, rt should be pornted out that, desprte the extraordrnary pace of econom1c development

IV. Risks v. Opportunities for Maine’s Tribal Citizens 
A. The Wabanaki Nations have much to gain from lifting MICSA’s 
restrictions 
As noted above, the Wabanaki Nations are low performers in many vital dimensions It 1S 
implausible that this poor performance 1S something inherent ui the Wabanaki Nations or Maine 
themselves The patterns of improvement across tribes in the other Lower 48 states are found in 
large tribes and small tribes, rural tribes and urban tribes, and in economically poor states and 
better-off states The discussion above supports the hypothesis that what has been missing in Maine 
1S full access by its tribes to the powers of local self-govemment and the related federal 
self-determination programs and funding that the tribes in other states have en_| oyed 
As tribal leaders described to the Task Force, MICSA has severely hampered the ability of the 
tribes in Maine to exercise powers of self-government by 
1 Limiting the provision of essential govermnental services to tribal and non-tribal 
Maine citizens, 
2 Blocking economic development in tribal communities and the communities around 
them, 
3 Restricting the eligibility of the tribes, their citizens, and surrounding communities 
for federal programs and funding, and 
4 Increasing costly and protracted litigation over the extent of tribal and state 
Jurisdiction, to the detriment of all Maine citizens (Carpenter et al , 2020) 
The practical effect of MICSA’s restrictions shows up in the economic performance of the 
Wabanaki Nations relative to similarly situated tribes in the rest of the US Consider, for example, 
the relative Wabanaki employment data shown in Figure 9 below Here, we make use of publicly 
available data on full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) of the US tribes immediately before the 
onset of the COVID pandemic These data were provided and certiﬁed by the nation’s federally 
recognized tribes in the process of the US Treasury Department ’s allocation of COVID relief funds 
under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Henson et al , 2021) In the ﬁgure, we plot the 
Wabanaki Nations’ total number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees against comparable 
measures for the tribes in the “Lower 46” (i e , the states other than Oklahoma, Maine, Alaska, and 
Hawaii) 14 
“Hawaii has no federally recognized tribes, tribes in Alaska (with its corporatized approach), Oklahoma (with the 
predominance of Indian “areas”), and Maine (with MICSA) operate under policy frameworks that are distinctly different 
from federal policy goveming the tribes in the “Lower 46”

Research mdlcates that, after accountlng for lnternal factors (such as a tr1be’s constltutlon and 
govem1ng structure), external factors such as a tr1be’s locatlon relatlve to substantlal urban markets 
can affect a tr1be’s economlc fortunes and, hence, the number of ]obs—-FTEs—the trlbe supports 
(Cornell and Kalt, 2000) Then, too, after accountmg for the lnﬂuence of other factors, a tr1be’s s1ze 
mlght also be expected to affect the number of _]ObS 1t supports A tr1be w1th a small populatlon near 
or 1n a 1'I12l_]O1 ‘ market mlght be expected to support a large number of _]ObS v1a a tnbal casmo or retall 
enterprlses (e g , as do, for example, a number of Cal1forn1a trlbes located 1n ma] or metropohtan areas, 
albelt w1th small numbers of c1t1zens), but a s1m1larly located trlbe wlth a large number of c1t1zens 
would be expected to support even more FTEs (as the tr1be not only operates buslnesses, but also 
staffs larger tnbal government operatlons to serve those c1t1zens) 
To reﬂect the fore go mg factors and be able to compare the Wabanak1Nat1ons to other tnbes that are 
s1m1larly sltuated v1s-a-v1s c1t1zen enrollment and locatlon, Flgure 9 1s structured to account for those

We can ﬁnd nothmg fundamental about the Wabanak1 Natlons, themselves, that would lead us to 
expect that they would be so economlcally underdeveloped relatlve to other tr1bes In fact, wh1le 1t 
1s statlstlcally pOSSlbl6 that one or more of the Wabanakl Nat1ons would have ended up far below or 
far above the l1ne of averages 1n Flgure 9, the ava1lable 1nformat1on would lead us to the statlstlcal 
expectatlon that they would have landed on the l1ne In partlcular, there 1s no lnherentreason to beheve 
that they all would have rnherently underperfonned the bulk of trlbes 1n the “Lower 46 ” Of course, 
there 1s one factor that all four of the tnbes 1n Mame do share 1n common For the last four decades, 
they have all been restrlcted by Mame is decrsrons under the Mame Indlan Clalms Settlement Act from 
partaklng III the full range of federal pol1c1es and programs of self-determ1nat1on that other trlbes have 
enjoyed 
B. Challenges to success: Tribal government structures 
Clearly, the opportunltles are large and the stakes are hlgh for Ma1ne’s trlbal c1t1zens More than 
doubllng the s1ze of a tr1be’s economy could do nothlng but 1mprove economlc condltrons w1th1n 
tr1bal connnunltles And the “v1rtuous cycle” dlscussed above would be expected to work for the 
Wabanak1 Nat1ons as 1t has for other tr1bes The mcreased enterprlse and governmental sector 
act1v1ty underly1ng _|ob growth would mean more 1ncome, accumulatlon of more work expenence, 
lmprovement and expanslon of commumty servlces and mfrastructure, greater attractlveness to 
entrepreneurs, and lI‘I1pI'OV6d capaclty to tap 1nto market and pubhc sector opporttmltles 
But success under self-detennmatlon through self-government 1s not guaranteed. Th1s 1s true not 
only for tnbes, but for self-govemlng soc1et1es everywhere Not all states are hlgll performers, and 
not all natzons around the world are hlgh performers In the case of self-govemlng Indrgenous 
natlons, the root causes of perslstent economlc underdevelopment and attendant social stralns do not 
generally appear to be external factors often thought to htnder trlbal development ——1 e , factors such 
as geographlc slze or 1solat1on, access to natural resources, the s1ze or spatlal denslty of the trlbal 
populatlon, or even educatlon (Comell and Kalt, 2000) Whlle attrlbutes such as belng closer to 
markets, better resource endowments, and more educatlon can help a tnbe, for each such ostenslble 
obstacle there are numerous lnstances of trlbes that have broken the backs of long-standlng problems 
of poverty and soclal stress 1n the era of self-determmatlon desplte (at least 1n1t1ally) poor access to 
markets, weak natural resource bases, low educatlonal attalnment To c1te _]I.lSt a few

- The Hualapal Tr1be, ment1oned above and w1th approx1mately 2400 c1t1zens, was seem1ngly 
forever trapped 1n very rural, desolate Ar1zona and 1n econom1c desperat1on unt1l 1t adopted 
self-govern1ng pol1c1es and structures that have allowed 1t to now become the second largest 
employer 1n Mohave County, Ar1zona (after the County, 1tselt) (Kalt, 2017a) 
- A s1m1lar story 1s told by Fort Belknap (see above), whlch has proceeded w1th econom1c 
development and concom1tant 1mprovement 1n soclal servlces 1n a settmg of extreme 
geograph1c 1solat1on, only modest natural resources, and h1stor1cally weak educatlonal 
attalnment 
- The Wlnnebago Tr1be’s Ho-Chunk, Inc , a very successful conglomerate 
manufacturmg-construct1on- ﬁnanc1al-d1str1but1on-consultlng company, emerged out of the 
comﬁelds of rural Nebraska from be1ng v1rtua1ly noth1ng 1n the late 1980s (I-IPAIED, 2000a) 
Where we do see some examples of stark underperformance of tr1bes otherw1se able to exerclse 
broad powers of self-govemment Lll’ld6I‘ current federal pol1c1es of self-determmatlon, the root cause 
most often emanates from underperform1ng mst1tut1ons of self-governrnent (Cornell and Kalt, 2000) 
L1ke states trymg to serve the1r c1t1zens ’ local needs, sovere1gn tr1bes have resp0ns1b1l1t1es to bu1ld 
the1r own capac1t1es to govern, pr1or1t1ze the needs of therr c1t1zens, and fund and efﬁc1ently del1ver 
serv1ces Meet1ng these respons1b1l1t1es requ1res leadersh1p, organ1zat1onal capac1ty, and resources 
But these steps requ1re ﬁrm f011I1d8.'ElOIlS 
For many tr1bes 1n the Self-Determ1nat1on Era, the lay1ng of the1r governmental foundat1ons started 
w1th const1tut1onal reform Sunply cont1nu1ng to operate under federally-drafted const1tut1ons of the 
type effectwely lIIlpOS6Cl on or adopted by hundreds of tr1bes as a result of the Ind1an Reorgan1zat1on 
Act (IRA) of 1934 (P L 73-383) has not sulted most trlbes These “bo1lerplate ” systems were marked 
by a structure cons1st1ng of (1) a one-house leg1slature, (11) no separat1on of powers between the 
tr1bal chlef executlve and the tr1bal counc1l, (111) no prov1s1ons for stable court systems, and (1v) l1ttle 
ant1c1pat1on of Self-Determmatlon Era powers of taxatlon, law enforcement, enterprlse ownershlp, 
and other core governmental ftmct1ons (Kalt, 2007) 
Upon ﬁndlng the1r 1n1t1al efforts at self-governance ﬂounder1ng (or worse) under const1tut1ons 
that were not of the1r own maklng, many tr1bes ended up pursumg const1tut1onal reform Research 
on trlbal const1tut1ons ﬁnds that trlbal econom1c success (and even pos1t1ve govemmental program 
performance) 1s strongly related to const1tut1onal structures Systems marked by separatlons of 
leg1slat1ve and execut1ve powers, 1ndependent court or dlspute resolut1on systems, and staggered and 
longer terms for elected ofﬁc1als, for example, are assoc1ated w1th tr1bal econom1c growth and 
hlgh-performlng tr1bal government programs (Kalt, 2007, Cornell and Kalt, 2000)

Lest qu1ntessent1ally Western terms such as “separat1ons of powers” and “1ndependent court 
system” suggest the solutlon to good governance for tr1bes 1s to Westernlze then‘ governments, 
Ind1an Country 1s teach1ng the world that sound governance, mdeed, requ1res the noted attr1butes but 
does not have to look Western Dec1dedly non-Western, even theocrat1c, structures w1tl1 the noted 
character1st1cs of 1ndependent drspute resolutlon, separatrons of powers, etc are underg1rd1ng 
thr1v1ng Natlve cornmun1t1es What 1s requlred 1s that such structures be 1n place and consonant w1th 
and leg1t1mate 1n the context of each tr1be’s own cultural norms regardmg the proper use of power 
and authorlty (Cornell and Kalt, 1997, Kalt, 2007) 
The Wabanakl Nat1ons vary 1n the1r const1tut1onal structures and evolutlon, as well as thelr 
bus1ness development 1nst1tut1ons 
- Each of the Passamaquoddy Tr1be’s subd1v1s1ons (Pleasant Po1nt and Ind1an Townshlp) 
operates under a const1tut1on that provides for s1x-member councrls and a Sakom (Governor) 
and Leptanet (L1eutenant govemor), and these ofﬁcers fonn an overall Jolnt Trlbal Counc1l 
Counc1l Members serve four-year, staggered terms of ofﬁce as members of the trrbal 
leglslature (counc1l) The Tr1be also operates a _]OlI‘l'[ tnbal court protected by the need for 
unanlmous counc1l consent to remove tr1bal Judges, supported by strong limltatlons on the 
ab1l1ty of a counc1l to de-ﬁlnd the courts, and layered tr1al and appeals mechamsms (S1pay1k, 
1990, Motahkom1kuk, 1993) In 1ts bus1ness deal1ngs the Tr1be has already adopted structures 
cons1stent w1th best pract1ces by, for example, charterlng 1ts Passamaquoddy Wlld Blueberry 
Company as wholly owned by the Trlbe but governed by a pol1t1cally mdependent board 
(Bureau of Ind1an Affalrs, 2011) 
- W1th 1ts late recogn1t1on by the federal government, M1’kmaq cont1nues to develop 1ts 
government N1ne counc1l members, 1nclud1ng a ch1ef and v1ce-ch1ef, serve four-year 
staggered terms (M1’kmaq Nat1on, 2022) Although the Tr1be has pursued development ofa 
tr1bal court, 1ts efforts have been stymled by the MICSAl1m1tat1ons on M1’kmaq’s ]ur1sd1ct1on 
and operatlon Thus, a tr1ba1 court 1s not yet operat1ng 
' The Penobscot Natlon 1s governed by a 12-member trlbal counc1l, W1th counc1l members 
servmg staggered, four-year terms (noted by the Natlon as lntended to prov1de stab1l1ty to 
trlbal government) (Penobscot Nat1on, 2021) The Natlon establ1shed a Tr1bal Court 1n 1979, 
prov1d1ng for a tr1al court, and a three-member appellate court The Nat1on’s Penobscot Ind1an 
Natlon Enterpnses (PINE) 1s a federally chartered corporatlon W1th 1ts own board of dlrectors 
- At the Houlton Band of Mahseet Ind1ans, the tnbal governlng body conslis of s1x counc1l 
members elected for staggered, four-year terms and a tr1bal ch1ef elected for four years The 
court system 1s nascent, w1th the Tr1be ut1l1z1ng the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy courts 
Leavlng tr1bal]ust1ce matters to be ruled upon by these other trlbes suggests an area for further 
development for Mahseet, but the arrangement does create a level of _]l1d1C13l mdependence 
from pol1t1cal affa1rs w1th1n Mahseet wh1le 1t develops 1ts own court system (Houlton Band of 
Mahseet Ind1ans, 2022) The Tr1be has also chartered 1ts wholly-owned local busmess

These trrbal govermng systems can be expected to be put to helghtened stress tests 1f MICSA’s 
restrlctlons are loosened or removed Trlbal leadershrp, 1n partlcular, w1ll be under pressure to ensure 
sound governance The lessons from the experlences of hundreds of other tubes are that success 1n 
thls effort 1s more l1kely than not, and the partles 1n the best pos1t1on to deslgn governmental 
structures surtable to a world of full self-determmatlon through self-government are the respectrve 
trlbal commumtres themselves They are m the best pos1t1on to recogmze the1r own needs, and the 
best pos1t1on to devlse competent and legltlmate structures to meet those needs (Begay et al , 2007) 
C. Challenges to success: Tribal governmental capacity 
Whlle the State of Mame has a long hlstory of work1ng to meet 1ts respons1b1l1t1es to 1ts c1t1zens, 
the part1cular1t1es and odd1t1es of MICSA have meant that the Wabanakl Natlons have had only 
stunted opportumtles and experlence to develop the1r capacrtles for self-govemment The loosemng 
or removal of MICSA’s would be expected to expand the respons1b1l1t1es and opporttmltles of 
Wabanakl Natrons’ govermnents Developmg and deploymg leadershlp, mcreased orgamzatlonal 
capaclty, and more resources w1ll tax the personal SklIlS and knowledge of commumty leaders and 
dec1s1on-makers Greater powers of self-detennmatlon through self-government w1ll requlre costly 
lnvestments 1n people and adm1mstrat1ve capaclty, and 1t w1ll force tnbes 1nt0 new 
relat1onsh1ps —1 e , as more equal local govemment peers—w1th nelghbormg c1t1es, countles, and the 
state 
These challenges are challenges bom of expanded opportumty, they are growmg pa1ns The 
trlbes w1ll bear the rrsk of fallure, or at least stumbllng, 1n meetlng these challenges In the process, 
not only tnbes, but the1r nelghbors mlght be adversely lmpacted The evldence from trrbes 1n the 
other Lower 48 states strongly suggests that the growmg pams are worth bearing, as the1r 6COI10l'I ‘l1C 
development 1n case after case has been accompanled and supported by lmprovements 1n tnbal 
government performance (as drscussed 1n Sectron III (HPAIED, 2022)) In many cases, the 
challenges of expanded self-governance have had to be addressed by trlbes 1n startmg pos1t1ons

Appllcants to Honormg Natzons submrt thelr fundmg proﬁles w1th therr appllcatlons Fully 215 
trrbal natrons are represented 1n the data of Flgure ll (HPAIED, 2022) There 1s lrkely to be some 
overwerghtlng of the data 1n Flgure 11 toward hrgh-performrng trrbal governments, because the 
applrcants to the Honorzng Natzons program would be expected to self-select based on reasonable 
expectatlons of bemg awarded—and publrcly recognIzed —for therr achrevements when and 1f

- 2007 Honormg Natzons awardee, the Muscogee (Creek) Natlon Relntegratrcm Program (RIP) 
was establ1shed by the Muscogee (Creek) Natron 1n Oklahoma to combat the challenges of 
remtegratmg lts crtrzens mto malnstream communlty l1fe and work upon therr release from 
prrson The Relntegratlon Program cut the crrmmal rec1d1v1sm rate among 1ts chents to 10%, 
compared to the 30% rate experrenced by the state of Oklahoma as a whole In response to th1s 
performance by RIP, the state of Oklahoma undertook to share _]LlI‘lSdlCtlOI1 and programmmg 
for correctlons wrth the Muscogee (Creek) Natron (I-IPAIED, 20080) 
What we can say from Frgure ll rs that hrgh-perfonnmg trlbal government programs 1n the era 
of Self-Determmatron derrve the largest portlons of the1r budgets from thelr trlbal governments —1 e, 
tnbes are self-fundmg at levels averagrng approxlmately 45% The noted trrbal operatlons do make 
substantlal use of federal fundmg, generally 1n the range of approxlmately 35% or somewhat less Thls 
reﬂects the endurmg trust respons1b1l1ty of the federal govermnent to tnbes (Bureau of Indlan Affarrs, 
2017) For COI'l'lp3.I ‘lSO1'1, the Tax Foundatlon reports that approxlmately federal ald made up 34 3% of 
Ma1ne’s state general revenue 1n 2020 (F r1tts, 2020) In other words, h1gh performmg trlbal programs 
are about as dependent on federal dollars as the state of Mame 
Whrle there 1s no avallable data comparable to the Honormg Natzons data for tnbes and tnbal 
programs that drd not apply to Honormg Natzons, anecdotal evrdence from the authors’ extenslve 
ﬁeldwork suggests that markedly underdeveloped tnbes are markedly dependent on federal fundmg 
The default mode for tnbes who lack substantral self-govermng capacrty 1s to fall back on federal 
servlces and federal ﬁlndrng In any case, state government fundmg of tnbes across the country rs 
qurte mslgnlﬁcant For the hrgh-performmg programs represented 1n Frgure ll, for example, state 
fundmg 1s generally less than 5% of program budgets (a level s1m1lar to the previously mentroned 
Washmgton tnbes’ 4% state fundmg) 
The lessons learned are that, nolwzthstandmg the hlstoly of demonstrably low absolute levels of 
federal allocatzons to lrzbes, federal pol1c1es of self-determmatron have provrded sufﬁcrent fundmg 
for tnbes to at least support bas1c governmental functlons, and, perhaps more lmportantly for 
generatrng excellence 1n performance, these federal pol1c1es have spurred the economlc development 
that has enabled tnbes to plough thelr own revenues back 1nto therr communrtles The rmplrcatron 
for the matters under consrderatron here 1s that we would not expect the state of Ma1ne’s budgets to 
be burdened by removmg MICSA’s restrrctrons on the Wabanakr Natlons’ ab1l1t1es to access the full 
range of the federal government ’s pohcles, programs, and fundmg of trrbal self-determlnatron 
through trlbal self-government If anythmg, the expectatlon runs 1n the opposrte d1rect1on As we 
detarl 1n Sectron V, the evrdence from across Indlan Country 1s that the expansron of the powers of 
tnbes to govern themselves over the last several decades has, overall, mured to the beneﬁt of state 
govemments and thelr non-trlbal crtrzens

V. Risks v. Opportunities for Maine’s Non-Tribal Citizens 
A. What are the stakes? 
To be sure, loosen1ng or removmg MICSA’s restrlctlons on the appl1cab1l1ty of the federal 
government ’s Self-Determmatlon po11c1es, programs, and fundmg to the Wabanak1Nat1ons 1n Mame 
could brmg substantlal change for the State of Ma1ne and Ma1ne’s Wabanak1 cltlzens What are the 
1mpl1cat1ons for Ma1ne’s non-trzbal c1t1zens'7 
Pubhc and leg1slat1ve d1scuss1on 1n the State of Ma1ne hlghlrghts areas of attent1on and pOSS1blC 
concern In broad form, promment among these are the prospectlve econom1c effects of br1ng1ng the 
Wabanak1Nat1ons 1n Ma1ne more, or even fully, under the federal govermnent ’s Self-Determlnatlon 
Era pol1c1es, programs, and fundmg, and the llkely lmpacts of do1ng so on envlromnental affarrs, the 
gammg lndustry, and state-tnbal relatlons 1n Mame Let us turn ﬁrst, to the econom1c stakes for 
Ma1ne’s non-trlbal c1t1zens 
Prlor research on the SIZC of trlbal 6COI10l'I116S conslstently reports results that make 1t clear that, 
across the U S , Indlan Country overall rs supportmg tens of b1ll1ons of dollars of total econom1c 
output and GDP (1 e , value added), b1ll1ons of dollars of federal, state and local, and trlbal government 
revenues, and more than a m1ll1on _]ObS held by Indlans and IlO1'l-II1(l13I'lS, al1ke 18 Indeed, these studles 
ﬁnd that on the order of 70%-90% of the _]ObS supported by Indlan Country are held by non-Indlans 
Whlle large, these econom1c lmpacts of tnbes are not surprlslng 1n l1ght of the remarkable 
econom1c growth of Ind1an Country 1n the Self-Determmatlon Era Numerous tnbes’ econom1es are 
now the “anchors” of whole reglonal econom1es Wrth thelr states, and many trlbes are at the stage of 
hav1ng to hlre numerous non-Indlans to meet therr needs for workers 1n both trlbal government and 
trlbal enterprlse Op€l‘€1[lOl'1S Those workers (Natlve and non-Natlve), thelr employers (trlbal and 
non-trlbal), and those employers ’ Natlve and non-Natlve cllents and customers spend therr mcomes 
1n local reservatlons and nerghbormg non-tnbal econom1es As these cycles of spendlng Work thelr 
way through the economy, they provlde lndlrect support for reglonal employers and thelr Workers, 
and result 1n d1rect and mdlrect sales, property, lncome, and other tax revenues for trlbal and 
non-tnbal state, local, and federal govemments

The foregomg carnes dlrect lessons for Mame and 1ts non-trlbal c1t1zens To the extent that 
MICSA’s restrlctlons have leﬂ; trlbal economlc development “on the table” for the reasons dlSCl.1SS €d 
1n Sect1on IV above, closlng tnbal development “gaps” by loosemng or removmg MICSA’s 
restr1ct1ons would be expected to have unamblguously posltwe overall nnpact on the level of 
econom1c act1v1ty and assoclated employment, IHCOIIIC, and state, local and federal tax revenues 
generated 1n Mame 
To assess the potentlal magnltudes of these effects, we begm wlth a statew1de economtc lmpact 
model based on detalled revenue, employment, and employee compensatlon data on lmmedlate 
pre-pandemlc gammg, non-gammg enterprlse, and tnbal govemment operat1ons provlded by 23 of 
the 29 tnbes m Washmgton (Taylor, 2022) We then adapt that model to key parameters for the state 
of Mame Whlle there are cettalnly dlfferences between the economles of Washlngton and Mame, 
our modelmg here focuses on the kmds of economlc actlvlty, employment, and purchasmg that tnbal 
economles commonly exh1b1t—e g , tnbal govermnent S61'VlC6S, gammg and related mdustrles, 
Sect1on 8(a) contractlng, and other non-gammg enterpnse operat1ons Th1s permlts us to sketch the 
economlc lmpacts Mame would hkely see 1f the employment gaps measured 1n Flgure 9 were closed 
In other words, the adapted modelmg permlts us to roughly assess what lmpacts are reasonable to 
expect 1f removmg or ehmlnatmg MICSA’s restrlctlons on Ma1ne’s tnbes part1c1pat1on 1n the federal 
Self-Determmatlon Era resulted 1n economlc development of those tr1bes up to the averages of then‘ 
peers‘? The results are shown 1n Table2

The results shown 1n Table 2 should be taken as rough approxrmatlons Adaptlng modelmg from 
another state’s settmg to Ma1ne’s has requlred the use of “rule-of-thumb ” ratlos and parameters 19 
Moreover, as we have pomted out, even 1f the stat1st1cal expectatlon 1s that the trrbes 1n Mame would 
perform over tlme at the averages of thelr peers 1n Frgure 9 (1 e , they would move up to the sloped 
lme 1n the ﬁgure), one or more of the Wabanak1Nat1ons mlght do better or mrght do worse than that 
W1th these caveats m m1nd, Table 2 shows that “closmg the gaps” between the Wabanalq Nat1ons 1n 
Mame and thelr peers elsewhere 1n the “Lower 46” could be expected to support hundreds of m1ll1ons 
of dollars of gross state product and thousands of Sp11lOVC1 ‘_]ObS, w1th the preponderance of these _]0bS 
bemg held by non-Ind1an workers Thrs economlc act1v1ty would also support tens of m1ll1ons of 
dollars of government revenue at trrbal, state and local, and federal levels 
The “stakes” pI‘0_]€Ct6d for Mame cltlzens 1n Table 2 are concentrated locally around the several 
trlbes m Mame To provrde a sense of th1s local rmportance, Table 3 shows the most recently avallable 
data on the rankmgs of employers by slze 1n Aroostook Cotmty, Penobscot County, and Washlngton 
County, Mame These count1es are, respectlvely, where the Wabanakl Nat1ons have reservatlons 
Table 3 mdrcates that, 1n Aroostook County, Malrseet and M1’kmaq Trrbes are the forty-second and 
forty-thlrd largest employers If these two trlbes were to perform at the average level of therr peers 
1n Flgure 9, they would be the 6th largest and 9“‘ largest employers 1n Aroostook County Penobscot 
would _]l11'I1p to 7“‘ largest employer 1n 1ts eponymous county Passamaquoddy Indran Townshlp and 
Pleasant Po1nt would r1se to ls‘ and 2"“ places, respectlvely 1n Washmgton County 
19Our adaptmg of the Washmgton-level modelmg to Ma1ne’s settmg entalls applymg ratlos from the one context to 
the other For example, we take the F0110 of the measured tnbal _|0bS to total supported _]0bS 1n Washmgton as an 
approxrmatlon for Mame, and use that ratlo to estlmate total supported Jobs 1n Mame (1 e , 2,743 1n Table 2) based 
on the Mame tr1ba1_]obs “gap” of 1,392 reported 1n Flgure 9 Glven Federal Reserve Bank ﬁgures for Mame’s GDP 
(FRED, 2022, MENGSP) and total worker employment 1n Mame (FRED, 2022, EMPLOYME), ylelds GDP per worker 
1n Mame Applymg th1s to the total _]0bS “gap” m Table 2 (2,743) allows a measure of Ma1ne’s overall GDP “gap”—1 e, 
$330 mllhon 1n Table 2 Sxmrlarly, we use tnbal govemment revenues per dollar of GDP from (Taylor, 2022) to amve 
at the estlmate of the trlbal revenue “gap” ($68 Il'll1ll0l ‘l) m Table 2 We use s1m1lar approaches based on data at the level 
of state and local tax revenues (Urban Instltute, 2022) and federal tax collecttons (W1k1ped1a, 2022) 1n Mame to arnve 
at the state, local and federal revenue “gaps” 1n Table 2 To €StlIIl21t6 the Indlan/non-Indran makeup of supported _|obs, 
we employ data from (Taylor, 2022) and from the US Census (Census, 2021) for the Indran/non-Indlan proportlons m

Fmally, the noted lmkages that t1e other trrbes’ econom1c development and tr1bal government 
performance together 1n the vtrtuous cycle of 1mprovement would be expected to apply 1n Mame, as 
well Locally, th1s would show up, as 1t has 1n so many other locales, as 1mproved capac1ty of the tr1bes 
to serve the needs of the1r own c1t1zens and concom1tant reduct1ons 1n burdens on the state and local 
non-tr1bal governments At the same t1me, tr1bal governments cannot be expected to be un1formly 
outstandlng 1n therr performance No govemment can properly be held to such a standard 
What can be sald from the cases and ev1dence d1scussed above 1s that enhanced local control 
by tr1bal c1t1zens of the1r governments generally HTlp1‘OV6S the prospects of stronger governmental 
performance Th1s 1s borne out by both extenslve systemat1c data and anecdotal ev1dence Thus, for 
example 
~ Stat1st1cal analys1s of scores of trlbes who have taken over management of the1r forest products 
lndustrles from the federal Bureau of Ind1an Affalrs ﬁnds that putt1ng tr1bal governments 1n 
control lI1'lpI‘OV6S both the ﬁnanc1al and the ecolog1cal product1v1ty of tr1bes’ resources 
(Krepps and Caves, 1994) And th1s 1s especlally the case when self-governlng tr1bes have 
sotmd governmg 1nst1tut1ons, such as lndependent court systems, 1n place (Jorgensen, 2000) 
- Trlbal CIUZCIIS report greater sat1sfact1on when law enforcement and emergency response are 
performed by the1r own governments —~response tlmes go down and commumty sat1sfact1on 
goes up (Wakellng et al , 2000, Taylor et al , 1999) 
~ Exh1b1t1ng 1nnovat1ve and n1mble adaptat1on 1ncreas1ngly seen among self-govermng trlbes

orchestrate —and pay for—upgrades to two highway interchanges on Interstate 5 which give

B. Impacts of potential tribal government gaming on non-tribal citizens 
One dimension of tribal economic development in the Self-Determination Era warrants particular 
attention, if only for its “glitz and glamour” For many tribes, the gammg industry —and Vegas-style 
casinos, in particular-have been the centerpieces of their development For the Wabanaki Nations, 
however, MICSA’s provisions have been employed by the state to block any of the Wabanaki Nations 
from availing themselves of the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA) 
(which effectively require states to enter into gammg compacts that launch tribal gammg operations) 
The forward-acting nature of AEWNA would not, by default, apply IGRA to the tribes of Maine 
As noted in Section I, however, additional legislation could bring the tribes m Maine under IGRA 
The result could then be self-governing Wabanaki tribal governments going into the gaming industry, 
_]LlS1l as Maine and a number of its state neighbors have done by operating their own gaming businesses 
(the state lotteries) and/or permitting casinos Accordingly, let us ask what the state of Maine and its 
non-tribal citizens could expect from casmos, starting with what 1S known about the economic and 
commtuiity effects of non-tribal casinos 
In the early decades of US casino liberalization, a view prevailed that whatever private beneﬁts 
accrued to casmo owners and workers, they were a Bad Bet for the public 2° The ﬁrst part of that 
view has been born out——many studies conﬁrm economic beneﬁts 21 As for the “Bad Bet,” gambling 
was seen as inherently dangerous —-an otherwise “unproductive ” [szc] leisure activity that brought 
organized crime pressure, disordered gambling, substance abuse, suicide, bankruptcies, and other 
problems 
20Tl'llS was the name of a representative book with this stance Bad bet The mszde stoify of the glamour; glztz, and danger 
of America is‘ gamblmg Industry (O’Brien, 1998) 
21As was shown, for example, in economic research conducted under the direction of the National Gambling Impact Study 
Commission (Rose, 1998)

Wh1le there have been myr1ad bottom-up studres of part1cular costs and beneﬁts——espec1ally by 
cas1no opponents and proponents —top-down exam1nat1ons of the net effects of caslnos can cut 
through the duel1ng stud1es One of the best of these 1s a study by the Un1vers1ty of Ch1cago’s 
Nat1onal Op1n1on Research Center (Jolmson, 1999) The Nat1onal Gamblmg Impact Study 
Comm1ss1on ——1tself a Congress1onally chartered body compr1s1ng gammg opponents and 
proponents —funded the research NORC’s study exammed a 16-year per10d of cas1no openlngs 
usmg a randomly selected group of 100 US commun1t1es, about half of wh1ch exper1enced a cas1no 
open1ng w1th1n ﬁfty mlles It found cas1nos brought 
~ A 17% declme 1n 1ncome from unemployment 1nsurance 
' A 12% decrease 1n the unemployment rate (about one pornt) 
' A 13% decllne 1n mcome from 1ncome ma1ntenance programs 
' A 3% decllne 1n 1ncome from transfer payments 
- Var1ed gams and losses 1n earn1ngs by sector 
' No d1scem1ble changes 1n bankruptcy, cr1mes affect1ng publ1c safety and property, or 1nfant 
mortahty (Johnson, 1999, Table 22) 
As the study observed about 1ts soc1al cost ﬁnd1ngs regard1ng soc1al costs 
Th1s 1s not to say that there 1s no caslno-related crlme or the l1ke, rather, these effects are 
e1ther small enough as not to be not1ceable m the general wash of the stat1st1cs, or whatever 
problems that are created along these l1nes when a caslno 1s bu1lt may be cotmtered by 
other effects (Johnson, 1999, 70)” 
Cas1no soc1al costs may get lost 1n the “general wash of the stat1st1cs ” because gambhng-drlven 
soc1al consequences are relat1vely small Bankruptcy ar1s1ng from 1nJury, 1llness, and med1cal 
expense 1s one order of magn1tude more prevalent than from gambl1ng about 50% of surveyed 
bankruptcy ﬁlers attr1bute med1cal costs versus 1 2% for “uncontrolled gambhng” (H1mmelste1n 
et al , 2005) 23 The nat1onw1de cost of d1sordered alcohol use 1s two orders of magn1tude larger 
$166 5 b1ll1on for alcohol aga1nst an est1mated $5 b1ll1on for the natlonal annual cost of problem and 
patholog1cal gamb11ng (per Gerste1n et al , 1999, 53) 
22111 add1t1on to bemg random1zed (wh1ch perm1ts a degree of causal 1nference I10t_]l1St an assessment of correlat1on), the 
NORC study’s mult1level regress1on structure produces a slmultaneous exammatlon of treatment versus control and 
before versus after casmo openmg 
23Wh1le controversy attends the est1mat1on of the role of medlcal costs 1n bankruptcy (see, e g , Dobk1n et al , 2018, 
H1mmelste1n et al , 2019), that controversy does not overturn the bas1c observatlon that med1cal bankruptcy 1s an order 
of magmtude more prevalent than gambhng bankruptcy Indeed, because 1t1s so small, gambl1ng ’s role 1s mfrequently 
1solated as a cause of bankruptcy 1n top-down rev1ews of ﬁl1ngs, and 1f 1t 1s mentloned, 1t 1s rout1nely lumped 1n as an 
“other” category (e g , Austln, 2014, 21)

Concerns that the expanslon of gambllng opportunltres automatlcally leads to srgmﬁcant 
mcreases In the rates of gamblmg mvolvement and the prevalence of dlsordered gamblers 
are not supported by research It appears that after the novelty of m1t1al exposure, people 
gradually adapt to the potentral rrsks and harms assoclated w1th gambllng (Shaffer et al, 
20 1 9, 1 04) 
And, of course, the c1t1zens of Mame have already been exposed to gambllng In addltlon to the 
relatlvely new, prlvately owned, Mame-llcensed casmos 1n Bangor and Oxford County, 2020 marked 
the Mame Lottery’s 46"‘ year It collected $79 6 m1ll1on 1n revenue that year (Census, 2020) In 2021, 
gross gamlng revenue from casmos 1n Mame was $146 9 m1ll1on (AGA, 2022) Ma1ne also has horse 
tracks, fantasy sports bettlng, and charltable gam1ng(see, e g , M1118 et al , 2021) 
The foregolng speaks to the effects of gamlng generally, but Indran gamlng may have d1st1nct1ve 
Impacts on non-Indlan ne1ghbors The contentlon that Indlan casmos are economlcally bad for 
states—or at least damagmg to state tax collect1ons —1s not a mere strawman The idea has been put 
forward by consultmg economrsts (e g , Anderson et al , 2003) A pubhc pol1cy nonprofit madea

tnbal governments rank the1r collectlve total employment (1n governments, casmos, and other 
buslnesses) among the top ten employers of, e g , Anzona and Washmgton (Taylor, 2015, 2022) 
Reglonal anecdotes tell of Indran tnbes becommg top local employers (e g , In Payson, AZ, Chelan,

So, should Malne expect harms from Indzan cas1nos‘7 The Indlan Gammg Regulatory Act alms to 
m1nIm1ze the burdens non-Ind1ans bear To take advantage of exlstmg state regulatory €XpCI'll1SC, 
IGRA requlres trlbes that want Las-Vegas-style (Class III) casInos to s1gn a trlbal-state compact that 
artlculates the scope and regulatlon of gamlng Under vlrtually all such compacts, three sets of 
regulators —trIbal, state, and federal gammg c0mm1ss1ons —oversee the falmess of games, Internal 
ﬁnanclal controls, and the l1censIng of key personnel 25 IGRA also penmts (and most compacts 
requIre) tr1bes wIth cas1nos to relmburse the states for the1r Indlan regulatlon 
Tr1bal contr1butIons to char1tIes and other govermnents are also permltted uses of Indlan caslno

Topoleskl, 2002) 
These results should be unsurprIs1ng Tnbal economIes are generally small and must turn to 
surroundmg markets for goods, servlces, and labor ExpendIture data from four trlbes In Washmgton 
conﬁrms that the preponderance of vendor outlays——more than 94°/I—go to off-reservatlon z1p codes

Contrary to the “slphon” theory holdlng that Indlan casmo customers ’ money departs from state 
economles soon after appearmg on the casrnos’ books never to return, such patron spendmg becomes 
state-taxable, off-reservatlon purchases of goods, servlces, and labor 27 In slgnlﬁcant measure, th1s 1s 
due to the fact that tr1ba1 employment commonly entalls h1gh proportlons of non-Indlan workers As 
we saw above, as much as 90% of trrbal-generated employment natlonally 1s non-Indlan employment 
In the same ve1n, data from 23 of Wash1ngton ’s 29 trlbes lndrcate a total tr1bal workforce that 1s more 
than two-thlrds non-Indlan and a casmo workforce that 1s four-ﬁfths non-Indlan (Taylor, 2022) 
In add1t1on, Indlan caslno net lncome tends to remam 1n-state because 1t accrues to 1n-state 
governments In contrast to prlvately held caslnos WhlCl1 d1str1bute the1r earnrngs to owners and

Tnbal governments ’ productlon of pubhc goods, servlces, and amenltles funded by casmo earmngs, 
by the1r nature, tend to also beneﬁt the communltles around them 
In sum, the ev1dence lndlcates that, 1f the Wabanak1 Natlons were brought under IGRA and the 
other components of the Self-Determlnatlon Era’s self-governance pol1c1es, programs, and fundlng, 
non-tr1bal c1t1zens of Mame could expect to be made better off on the whole when and 1f one or more

below, this commonly takes the form of intergovernmental agreements and cost-sharing Even though 
constrained by MICSA-engendered economic underdevelopment, the Wabanaki Nations have already 
shown themselves willing and capable of engaging in such types of productive intergovemmental 
relations 
C. Impacts on environmental and related amenities that affect the quality of 
life in Maine 
Easing or removing the restrictions of MICSA could enhance the Wabanaki Nations’ 
governments ’ regulatory powers over Wabanaki natural resources and related public amenities This 
has led to concerns that tribal government management of tribal ﬁsheries, wildlife, forests, and the 
like might SLll)_]€Ct non-Native persons and companies to additional and stricter environmental 
regulation or, alternatively, might result in the degradation of the health or value of those resources 
Again because no government ——tribal or non-tribal —is “perfect” , it is not possible to generate an 
unassailable answer in one direction or the other regarding concerns of these types However, we can 
again turn to the experience seen in other states where tribes already exercise extensive _]LlI‘1SdlCtlOl'l 
over natural resources and the environment There, the available evidence and experience supports 
the conclusion that tribal communities do place high value on the protection of their lands and 
resources Shortcomings in such protection by tribal governments are rarely the result of a lack of 
commitment, but rather arise due to deﬁciencies in human and technical resources and capacity As 
we have discussed above, the best antidote to those impediments to governmental performance 
across Indian Country has been economic development 
In the environmental arena, the economic development spurred by tribal self-government has 
repeatedly resulted in tribes being willing and able to devote greater resources to environmental and 
resource management Illustrative of this are cases including 
- The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation 111 northeast Oregon _]O1I1lZly owns 
and operates —through its company, Warm Springs Power Enterprises —three hydroelectric 
dams with Portland General Electric The Tribes’ position as owner-operator has permitted it 
to implement selective water withdrawal towers behnid the dams so as to allow salmon to 
return to the Upper Deschutes River basin for the ﬁrst time in four decades This has been 
accomplished at no loss in electricity production (PGE and WSPE, 2022) 
- The wildlife biologists of the Nez Perce Tribe played an indispensable role in the reintroduction 
of the gray wolf to federal land in Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, earning the Tribe accolades for 
responsiveness and profess1onalism —even from ranchers whose livestock were victims of wolf 
predation (HPAIED, 1999)

At ﬁrst blush, 1t seems reasonable to worry that ampl1fy1ng Wabanakl governance w1th more of 
the powers tnbal governments wleld elsewhere could result 1n mcreased l1t1gat1on, conﬂlct, confuslon, 
and/or dysfunctlon (see, e g , Frey, 2020) Yet a moment’s reﬂectlon reveals that the absence of trlbal 
soverelgn powers 1n Mame has ltself been fraught wlth conﬂlct and even costly, producmg seemmgly 
never-endmg l1t1gat1on between Mame and the tnbes MICSA has been a source of sustalned conﬂlct 
between the state government (and local subs1d1ar1es) and the governments of the Wabanak1Nat1ons 
The expense, upset and uncertalnty, and aIlll’l'1OSlUCS created by thls are not 1n the mterests of the state’s 
trlbal or non-tr1bal c1t1zens 
Notwlthstandmg MICSA, the urge for self-government 1n local commun1t1es —tr1bal and 
non-tr1bal —1s hard to extmgulsh Th1s 1s partlcularly true of the Wabanak1Nat1ons, who can see 1n 
thelr counterparts across Indlan Country the pI‘01'I'llS6 of local self-govermnent As for the State of 
Mame, 1f numerous govermnents abuttmg and even overlapplng each other 1s cause for rrresolvable 
conﬂlcts and confuslon, the state 1s r1pe for such problems In fact, the state tacltly embraces a 
mult1pl1c1ty of abuttlng and often-overlappmg governments By the US Census’s count m 2017,

Mame then had slxteen countles, 23 mumclpal govemments, 465 townshlp governments, 98 
mdependent school d1str1cts, and 232 speclal purpose d1str1cts The Census’s SpCCl3.l d1str1ct category 
lncluded 82 slngle-functlon water dlstncts, 41 slngle-functlon sewerage d1str1cts, 30 houslng and 
communlty development d1str1cts, 22 multlple- ﬂlnctlon water and sewerage d1str1cts, and numerous 
other d1str1cts governlng ut1l1t1es, so1l and water conservatlon, cemeterles, health, and more (Census, 
2017) 
Strengthenlng (not addlng) ﬁve govemments among Mame’s 504 others—or as many as 834, 
dependlng where one draws the l1ne 1n the Census’s speclal d1str1cts category —would not produce a 
quantum leap 1n lntergovernmental conﬂlct or confuslon ThlS 1s especlally true conslderlng that 
self-governlng tnbes routmely enter 1nto compacts, contracts, memoranda of understandlng, and 
other s1m1lar agreements w1th the governments around them In thls, trlbal governments mlrror the 
conduct of responslble govermnents —federal, state, pl‘OVlI1C1al, local—everywhere Tr1bes 1n the 
other Lower 48 states rout1nely enter mto tax compacts, pollce cross-deputlzatlon agreements, 
payments-1n-lleu-of-taxes agreements, lmpact m1t1gat1on agreements, comlty agreements, resource 
rental and cost-sharlng arrangements, and more w1th state and local governments (Johnson et al, 
2009) 
As always, conﬂ1ct captures the headllnes and cautenzes mlnds Yet, as trxbal governments have 
matured and asserted the1r self-governlng powers 1n the other Lower 48 states, 1t has frequently been 
state governments who have played lead roles 1n fosterlng productlve state-trlbal relatlons Wlth 
educatlonal and operatlonal mechamsms of cooperatlon contmulng to be bu1lt m speclﬁc areas 
rangmg from _|ud1c1al affalrs and pol1c1ng to health and chlld protectlon servlces, organlzatlons such 
as the Natlonal COUIICII of State Leglslatures (N CSL) have bullt overarchlng programs and structures 
deslgned to foster mutually beneﬁclal tnbal-state relatlons Through lnstntutes, gurdes, tramlngs, 
Worklng groups, databases, and S111d1CS, NCSL has bullt knowledge, techn1ques, and models now 1n 
wlde use As NSCL concluded 1n 1ts 2009 study of models for state-trlbal relatlons 
As Indlan trlbes lmprove governmental capaclty and more frequently exerclse thelr 
powers of self-govemment, tnbal and state governments are lncreaslngly ﬁndmg areas 
of mutual mterest and dlscoverlng ways to set aslde _]LlI'lSd1ClIlOI1 ﬂl rlvalry 1n favor of 
cooperatlve government-to —goven1ment mteractlons Tnbes and states have been 
creatlng entlrely new structures for communlcatlon and collaboratlon, solutlons and 
agreements have been created for the ever-changlng range of lssues, and older 
trlbal-state mstltutlons have been strengthened and revlved (Johnson et al , 2009, at v11)

d1scussed above, 1n the effort to restore the Skutrk R1ver, the Wabanakl Natlons and the state of

Intergovemmental cooperat1on also takes place wlthout fonnal legal agreements For example, the 
Passamaquoddy Tnbe began conven1ng meetmgs between ofﬁc1als from the local water d1str1ct (a non- 
trlbal publ1c entlty called Passamaquoddy Water D1str1ct, PWD) and the state and federal governments 
to address an unsafe and decay1ng water system that served the Tr1be and the C1ty of Eastport The 
water was found to have dangerous levels of toxms, and users complamed of 1tch1ng and burnlng after 
bathmg w1th 1t and of 1ts foul odor and color The Trlbe contr1buted $250,000 1n pandemlc rel1ef funds 
to the 1nstallat1on of a new ﬁltrat1on system, wh1ch was recently 1nstalled at the water d1str1ct ’s water

treatment plant The rest of the upgrade was funded by a comblnatlon of state funds pursuant toa 
program that the state created 1n response to the Tr1be’s advocacy Notably untll 2022, PWD was the 
only water d1str1ct 1n the state to pay local property taxes, and the tax amount was roughly equrvalent 
to operatlons and malntenance costs of the new water ﬁlter upgrade The Tnbe 1ntroduced and sought 
enactment of state leglslatlon to exempt the local water d1str1ct from property taxes so 1t could afford 
upkeep on the new water ﬁlter The Trlbe bore 100% of the cost of draftlng and advocatlng for the 
leglslatlon, and Gov Janet MlllS slgned 1t 1n Apnl of thrs year The process has resulted 1n slgnrﬁcant 
upgrades to local drlnkmg water (Popp, 2022) 
To be sure, the foregomg are examples of productlve approaches to resolvmg conﬂlcts and 
conﬁ1s1on that can anse between governments Not all cases are resolved readrly and mexpenswely 
Th1s 1s as true of mtergovermnental relatlons that do not 1nvolve tnbes as 1t 1s 1n state-trlbal relatlons 
But to echo the Natlonal Councll of State Leglslatures, the vxrtuous cycles of trlbal economlc 
development and strengthenmg of trlbal governments that have taken place across Indlan Country 1n 
the era of federal pol1c1es of tnbal self-government are lessemng the frequency and seventy of 
trlbal-state conﬂ1ct, not lncreaslng such conﬂlct MICSA’s restr1ct1ons have blocked, or at least 
slgmﬁcantly attenuated, such v1rtuous cycles 1n the state of Mame 
VI. Conclusion: Nowhere to Go But Up 
Mame 1s consplcuous for the restrlctlons that MICSA has placed on the Wabanakl Natlons for 
four decades Elsewhere 1n that tlme, federal Indlan self-determlnatlon pol1c1es and trrbal actlon 
produced unprecedented and sustamed economlc growth accompamed by expansrons of tnbal 
respons1b1l1t1es and I‘lSll'1g ﬁscal, 1nst1tut1onal, and human capac1t1es to meet those respons1b1l1t1es 
Thls Natlve resurgence 1s redoundmg to the beneﬁt of trlbal and non-tnbal crtlzens Increasmg 
numbers of trlbes are the economlc englnes of thelr reglons, and hundreds of trlbes across the other 
Lower 48 states now routmely serve the1r c1t1zens w1th the full array of governmental functlons that 
we expect from state and local governments 1n the US 
We ﬁnd that the consequence of handcufﬁng Wabanakl self-govemment 1s today v1s1ble 1n the 
stark economlc underperformance of all four of the trrbes 1n Ma1ne—Ma]iseet, M1’kmaq, 
Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot No lnherent or Wabanak1 —w1de attnbutes readlly explam why all 
the Wabanak1Nat1ons 1n Mame tra1l the1r peers by so much The one attr1bute they all share 1s the 
restr1ct1ve construct of MICSA

Subjectmg the Wabanakr Natlons’ capacrtres to the restr1ct1ons of MICSA stlﬂes substantlal 
development opporttmltles — to the detnment of both the Wabanak1 and non-Wabanak1 c1t1zens of 
Mame The unreahzed opportumtles measure 1n the hundreds of m1ll1ons of dollars of GDP for the 
state, representlng support for thousands of _|obs held by Mamers and tens of m1ll1ons of dollars 
gomg mto Ma1ne’s trtbal, state, and local treasunes For the tr1bal cltrzens of Ma1ne, loosenmg or 
removlng MICSA’s restnctlons offers few downsrde rrsks and many upsrde payoffs There’s 
nowhere to go but up 
The experrences of the other Lower 48 states worklng w1th trlbes 1nd1cate that “nowhere to go 
but up” also apphes to Mame and rts non-tnbal c1t1zens In case after case, self-detenmned, self- 
governed trrbal economrc development sprlls over p0s1t1ve1y mto nelghborlng non-trlbal communrtres 
and lmproves governance generally Conﬂlcts ar1s1ng between trlbal and non-trlbal governments are 
to be expected, as 1s the case between any nelghbormg and/or overlapplng governments Generally, 
expenence outslde of Mame does not predlct that strengthenmg tnbal self-govermnent mexorably 
leads to helghtened state-trlbal conﬂret Instead, lncreasmgly capable trrbal governments lmprove the 
prospects for mutually beneficlal resolut1ons of problems because both tnbal and non-trlbal partles 
can come to the table w1th mature capacltles to cooperate Agalnst these poss1b1l1t1es 1s the status quo 
Stlckmg w1th the status quo means all S1d6S leave €COI1OI‘l'llC opportumtles “on the table,” and ongolng 
cycles of mtergovemmental conﬂlct, l1t1gat1on, recrlmmatlon, and mlstrust w11l contlnue
