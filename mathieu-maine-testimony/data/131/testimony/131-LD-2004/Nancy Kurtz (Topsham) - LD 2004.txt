LD 2004
I am Nancy Kurtz, a resident of Topsham, Maine, and  as a citizen concerned with 
remediating our State's  historic treatment of the Wabanaki, I write in support of LD 
2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneficial to Wabanaki Nations. 
Under MICSA, Wabanaki tribes in Maine may not benefit from federal laws enacted 
to benefit tribes throughout the United States unless the law specifically includes the 
Wabanaki tribe. This is an excessive burden which has resulted in the inability of 
Wabanaki tribes in Maine to benefit from 151 federal laws that benefit other tribes. 
The bill would amend MICSA to remove this provision and retroactively allow 
federal laws to apply to the Wabanaki. These federal benefits would also benefit the 
rural areas surrounding the tribes. Please support this legislation to help put the 
Wabanaki tribes in Maine, as well as their surrounding rural areas, on a path to 
prosperity.
