LD 2004
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary
My name is Ann Dodd-Collins, and I live in Portland. Today I urge your Committee 
to vote unanimously OUGHT TO PASS on LD 2004.
The Wabanaki tribes in Maine are treated differently than the other 570 federally 
recognized tribes across the country. Because of the 1980 Settlement Act, when 
Congress passes federal legislation for tribes nationwide the tribes in Maine must be 
explicitly written into the legislation.  Of approximately 151 federal beneficial Indian 
laws passed by Congress since the Settlement Act was implemented in 1980, this has 
happened only once.  
Many of the laws which have passed that the tribes do not have access to would not 
only benefit the tribes but the surrounding rural areas. The Settlement Act has 
intentionally and systematically placed obstacles in the paths of our Wabanaki 
neighbors. Their self-determination and economic vitality have been stunted and so 
has the growth of their neighboring communities.
This legislation changes a provision in the 1980 Settlement Act that would at least 
begin the process of placing the tribes in Maine on the same footing as the other 570 
federally recognized tribes. It does not circumvent the Act.  
I urge you to support LD 2004.  It is long past time to start putting the tribes and rural 
Maine on a path to prosperity.
