Re: Support for L.D.  2004:  An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneficial to the 
Wabanaki Nations  
 
I am submitting thi s testimony  in support of LD 2004  An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws 
Beneficial to the Wabanaki Nations .  
LD 2004 would enable the Wabanaki Tribes in Maine to again be included in federal laws which 
are passed to benefit  Tribes  in the US . The other  570 federall y recognized  Tribes and their 
surro unding communit ies benefit from economic opportunities which are denied to Tribes in 
Maine , and by extension to the non -native  comm uniti es surrounding them . Automatic access 
was removed according to terms dictated by the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act , 
which stipulated that t o be included in any federal law benefit ting US Tribes  which was passed 
after 1980 , the Tribes of Maine needed to  be specifically named in that law – a unique burden  
that is imposed on  no other US T ribe. 
Some  have suggested  that Maine  should look at  each piece of legislation passed on a case by 
case basis. Do you have any idea how long that would take?  To take just one example , in 2013 
the Violence Against Woman’s Act was amended to include Native American women. However, 
the Tribes in Maine were not named, and so were not  included. It took Maine seve n years to 
finally pas s state  legislation mirroring the federal law .  
LD 2004 does not  circumvent the 1980’s Settlement Act . It simply changes a provision in the 
Act, to begin  a process of including  the tribes in Maine in new federal legislation . 
Please support LD 2004  to start putting the tribes on a path to prosperity.
