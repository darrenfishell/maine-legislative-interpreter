LD 2004
I am writing in support of LD 2004 An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws 
Beneficial to Wabanaki Nations. This bill is necessary because the old bill from 1980 
has caused tremendous burden on the tribes. They are missing out on benefits other 
tribes in the country receive. There have been studies done showing how much the 
tribes have lost as a result of this situation.
This has gone on too long already. It is past time to pass something which the tribes 
want and need. Please do it now!
Thank you for your time!
