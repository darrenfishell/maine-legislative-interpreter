LD 2004
Passing LD 2004 will start putting the tribes and rural Maine on a path to prosperity. 
Since signing the Lands Claims settlement in 1980, approximately151 federal laws 
have been passed that the tribes are not eligible to benefit from. Many of these laws 
would not only benefit the tribes but the surrounding rural areas. Without access to 
federal funding that helps everyone else, the tribes' self-determination and economic 
vitality have been stunted. Allowing access to federal beneficial laws will not only 
benefit the tribes but rural Maine. This legislation changes a provision in the 
Settlement Act that would at least begin the process of placing the tribes in Maine on 
the same footing as the other 570 federally recognized tribes.
