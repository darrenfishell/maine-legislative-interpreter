LD 2004
I am writing on behalf of the passage of LD 2004, to restore access to federal laws 
beneficial to the Wabanaki nation.
Having previously taught social work students at UMO, I had been perplexed by the 
low numbers of students from Indian Island in my classes.  One of the few Penobscot 
students attending explained that, despite the tuition break afforded to native students,
many of her acquaintances and friends lacked the self esteem and sense of their own 
potential, largely due to cultural oppression.  Passage of this bill would help to 
enhance opportunities for Wabanaki to self determine, benefit from economic and 
cultural enrichment, and contribute to well-being.
