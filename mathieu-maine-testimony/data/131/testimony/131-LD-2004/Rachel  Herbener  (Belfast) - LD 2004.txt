I was shocked to discover that the Wabanaki tribes in Maine are denied federal 
benefits that all other tribes in the U.S.are granted. A 2019 report by Suffolk 
University found that 151 federal laws were passed between 1980 and 2019 to benefit
tribes in the U.S.  The Wabanaki tribes were ineligible.  This is immoral. Please pass 
LD 2004.
