Testimony of Kirk E. Francis 
Chief of the Penobscot Nation 
on LD 2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneﬁcial to the Wabanaki Nations 
before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary 
May 31, 2023 
Good moming Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Committee Thank 
you for allowing me to testify in support of LD 2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws 
Beneﬁcial to the Wabanaki Nations I am Kirk Francis, Chief of the Penobscot Nation I have 
been Chief for the past 17 years and in elected office for the Penobscot Nation oﬁ‘ and on since 
1992 The Penobscot Nation is one of the four federally recognized Wabanaki Nations located 
within the boundaries of the State of Maine The Penobscot Nation has approximately 2,400 
citizens and over 123,000 acres in land holdings, of which nearly 91,000 acres are held in trust 
by the United States Within our land holdings are about 200 islands located within 
approximately 80 miles of the Penobscot River Most of our land is undeveloped forestland, and 
Indian Island 1S our largest island and contains our seat of govermnent and our largest housing 
community 
I am testifying in support of LD 2004 because the bill will begin to mitigate some of the harms 
done to the Wabanaki Nations and surrounding communities caused by two provisions in the 
Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act that prevent any federal Indian law from applying to the 
Wabanaki Nations if it affects or preempts State _]l.11'1SCl1Ct101 ’1 This exclusion is unique to the 
Wabanaki Nations — no other federally-recognized tribes are S11l‘J_]CCl1 to such a sweeping 
exclusion from federal Indian laws It 1S an exclusion full of ambiguity because we never know if 
a federal Indian law affects or preempts State Jurisdiction until the State says something, and 
sometimes the State does not say anything until years later 
The language of LD 2004 shifts the burden from the Wabanaki Nations having to educate 
Congress and obtain inclusion of language expressly covering us in every bill to the State who 
will have to advocate for language expressly excluding application of any Federal Indian law in 
Maine We believe the State 1S better equipped to ask for exclusion of any laws that it sees as 
problematic The State actively monitors legislation pending in Congress and this Legislature 
and history shows that the State is able to obtain colloquies and other legislative statements 
expressing to exclude the Wabanaki Nations Most importantly, we think it is unreasonable for 
the State to be able to continue to ob] ect to the application of Federal Indian laws without any 
time restrictions or a process for evaluating whether the State’s Ob]6ClllO1 ’1S are reasonable As 
described in this testimony, continuing the status quo will continue to harm the Wabanaki 
Nations both economically and socially, and will continue to harm Maine’s rural communities 
History of Settlement Acts and Provisions at Issue in LD 2004 
In the early 1970s, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation requested the federal 
government, as their trustee, to assert legal claims on their behalf to a large portion of land in 
Page 1 of9I
Marne Our clalms were based on the fact that the federal government never approved any 
conveyances of trlbal lands as requlred by the federal Ind1an Non-Intercourse Act The federal 
government 1n1t1ated l1t1gat1on on behalf of the trlbal natlons 1n 1972, and settlement negot1at1ons 
began after the F1rst C1rcu1t Court of Appeals 1ssued a dec1s1on conﬁrm1ng that the Ind1an Non- 
Intercourse Act apphed to the trrbes1 
In 1980, the State of Ma1ne, the federal government, and the Passamaquoddy Trlbe and 
PenobscotNat1on negotlated a settlement The Mame Ind1an Clalms Settlement Act of 19802 
(“Settlement Act”) was enacted by Congress and s1gned 1nto law on Octobel 10, 1980 The 
correspondlng State Act to Implement the Mame Ind1an Clarms Settlement3 (“Marne 
Implementlng Act”) become effectrve upon ratrﬁcatlon by the federal government The Mame 
Implementlng Act was negotlated ﬁrst, and then the Federal Settlement Act was negotrated and 
approved by Congress 
Broadly speakrng, the two settlement acts set forth parameters whereby the Wabanak1 Natlons 
are sub] ect to state c1v1l and or1m1nal Jurrsdlctlon, but reta1nthe1r mherent soverergnty not 
otherw1se l1m1ted by the settlement acts 
Over the 42 years s1nce the Settlement Act and Ma1ne Implement1ng Act have been 1n place, the 
Wabanak1Nat1ons and State have been at odds a11d engaged 1n l1t1gat1on over varlous prov1s1ons 
of these laws Th1s l1t1gat1on often mvolved dlsagreements about the extent of the l1m1tat1ons 
placed on the Wabanak1Nat1ons ’ lnherent soverergn authorltres by the settlement acts Often, the 
Wabanak1Nat1ons faced l1m1tat1ons onthe1r1nherent soverelgnty that were never expressly 
dlscussed 01 fully understood durlng the course of the negot1at1ons Much of the dlsagreements 
between the State and Wabanak1Nat1ons rnvolved what the trrbal natrons vlewed as unmtended 
consequences of the settlement acts because they were not fully understood by the trrbal leaders 
or people 1n 1980 
An example of these unrntended consequences are the rmplementatlon of two provlsrons 
contamed 1n the federal Settlement Act The ﬁrst prov1s1on 1s sectlon 6(h) Wl'l1Ch states 
Except as otherw1se provlded 1n thls Act, the laws and regulatlons of the Unlted 
States wh1ch are generally apphcable to Ind1ans, Ind1an natrons, or trrbes or bands 
of Ind1ans or to lands owned by or held 1n trust for Ind1ans, Ind1an natrons, or 
tr1bes or bands of Ind1ans shall be appllcable 1n the State of Marne, except that no 
law or regulatlon of the Unlted States (1) Wl1lCh accords or relates to a spec1al 
status or r1ght of or to any Ind1an, Ind1an natlon, tr1be or band of Ind1ans Ind1an 
lands, Ind1an reservatlons, Ind1an country, Ind1an terntory or land held 1n trust for 
Ind1ans, and also (2) whlch affects or preempts the c1v1l, cr1m1nal, or regulatory 
]ur1sd1ct1on of the State of Mame, 1nclud1ng, w1thoutl1m1tat1on, laws of the State 
relatmg to land use or envlronmental matters, shall apply w1th1n the State

Th1s p1ov1s1on was rntended to preclude certam federal laws and regulat1ons enacted before 
from applyrng wrthm the State of Mame October 1980 
The second prov1s1on1s sectlon l6(b), whrch states 
The prov1s1ons of any Federal law enacted after the date of enactment of th1s Act 
for the beneﬁt of Indrans, Ind1an nat1ons, or trrbes or bands of Indrans, whrch 
would affect or preempt the appl1cat1on of the laws of the State of Marne, 
1nclud1ng apphcatlon of the laws of the State to lands owned by or held 1n trust for 
Indlans, or Ind1an natlons, tr1bes, or bands of Ind1ans, as provlded 1n th1s Act and 
the Marne Implementrng Act, shall not apply w1th1n the State of Mame, unless 
such prov1s1on of such subsequently enacted Federal law 1s speclﬁcally made 
apphcable w1th1n the State of Mame 
Th1s prov1s1on was rntended to restrrct federal laws enacted for the beneﬁt of Ind1an 
country after October 1980 from applyrng w1th1n the State, unless the law expressly 
1nd1cated that 1t was apphcable 1n Mame 
Questronable Hrstory of Sectlons 6(h) and 16(b) 
A revlew of the h1stor1cal record surroundmg sectlons 6(h) and 16(b) of the federal Settlement 
Act shows that these prov1s1ons were npe wlth amblgulty and controversy from the beg1m11ng4 
A 2017 report by Suffolk Un1vers1ty found that the U S Inter1or Department was on record as 
express1ng slgnlﬁcant concems w1th the broadness of the language of sectlon 6(h) In a letter 
from the Interror Department to U S Representatlve Moe Udall, Interror stated that 1t “found th1s 
prov1s1on troublesome and confusrng 1n that Federal ﬁnanclal beneﬁts to Ind1an tr1bes would be 
drvorced from general Federal statutes apphcable to Indlans ”5 And, Interror suggested that 1t 
would be better for Congress to enumerate the specrﬁc federal laws that would be excluded from 
applymg to the Wabanak1Nat1ons 1n Marne Ult1mately, Inter1or ’s suggest1on was rejected and 
ﬁnal verslon of sectlon 6(h) remamed overly broad 
Wlule the h1stor1cal record suggests that the PenobscotNat1on was aware of and reluctantly 
agreed to sectlon 6(h) 1n the federal Settlement Act, Suffolk Un1vers1ty ’s revrew of the record 
found no such awareness of sect1on l6(b), and no documents 1n the h1stor1cal record d1scuss1ng 
sectlon 6(h) or whether the tr1bes or Interror Department agreed to 1ts 1nclus1on Add1t1onally, 
Suffolk Un1vers1ty found that sectron 16(b) was added to the federal leg1slat1on _]L1S'[ days before 
the U S Senate and House of Representatlves voted on the leg1slat1on and after publ1c hearmgs 
on the leg1slat1on took place The Penobscot Nat1on d1d not agree to th1s prov1s1on berng added,

and we v1ew 1t as one of the most problematrc prov1s1ons 1n the federal Settlement Act Suffolk 
Un1vers1ty conducted a rev1ew of the h1stor1cal record and the t1m1ng 1n whrch the prov1s1on was 
added to the federal legrslatlon and found no evldence that the Wabanak1Nat1ons agreed to 1t 
Negahve Impacts of Sect1ons 6(h) and 16(_b) of Settlement Act 
Together, sectlons 6(h) and 16(b) of the Settlement Act have the potentlal to prevent Q1 federal law enacted for the beneﬁt of lndran Country from app1y1ng to the tnbal natrons 
1n Marne 1f such law at all “affects” Mame law There 1s no deﬁmtlon for the term 
“affects” 1n the Settlement Act, and the general deﬁn1t1on of the term 1s mcredrbly broad 
The two prov1s1ons have resulted 1n complete uncertamty as to wh1ch federal laws 
mtended to beneﬁt Indlan Country are appl1cab1e to the trlbal natrons 1n Mame, and they 
have resulted 1n the State bemg able to prevent appl1cat1on of any federal law by merely 
assertmg that such federal law “affects” Marne law 
Each of the Wabanakl Natlon/s has been negatlvely lmpacted by these two prov1s1ons 
Below are Just a few of the examples 
Around 2005, the PenobscotNat1on was workmg w1th an energy company on developmg 
a w1nd farm on Penobscot Natron trust lands Th1s energy pro] ect would have provlded 
slgmﬁcant economlc beneﬁts to the PenobscotNat1on, but 1t would have also enhanced 
Ma1ne’s transm1ss1on capaclty by burldmg a transfer statron 1n Alder Stream Townshrp 
The Tnbe had developed 1ts own permrttmg regulatlons and attempted to work wrth the 
State on a ]o1nt permrttrng process, but the State ob] ected say1ng that only 1ts permrttmg 
process was apphcable even though the pI‘0_]6ClI was to be bu11t on tr1bal trust land The 
company ultlmately walked away because of the lack of clanty about wh1ch laws apphed 
on tr1bal trust land and because the company d1d not want to get 1nto a ]ur1sd1ct1onal ﬁght 
between the Tnbe and State PenobscotNat1on had rnvested more than 5 years 1nto th1s 
pI‘O]6Ct, whlch mcluded feas1b1l1ty studles, wmd testrng, and securmg an economrc 
partner 
In the 2000s, the PenobscotNat1on promulgated 1ts own water quahty standards for 
waters w1th1n the Tr1be’s terntory We d1d a statewrde publ1c hear1ng effort 1n developlng 
these standards Ultlmately, the State ob] ected to om‘ standards applyrng to waters w1th1n 
our terntory saymg that the federal Clean Water Act d1d not apply 1n Mame Penobscot 
went to the federal Envrromnental Protectron Agency but the federal agency d1d not want 
to get 1n the mlddle of a ]ur1sd1ct1onal ﬁght between the State and Tr1be Eventually, 
however, the federal Envrromnental Protectron Agency re] ected Ma1ne’s proposed water 
quahty standards for the State’s waters Th1s led the State to work w1th the Tr1be on the 
development of state-wrde water quahty standards that everyone could agree to 
In 2012, Congress passed amendments to the Robert T Stafford Dlsaster Rehef and 
Emergency Asslstance Act that would allow federal recogmzed tnbal natrons to submlt 
requests for ma] or drsaster or emergency declaratrons drrectly to the Presrdent of the 
Umted States and obtam federal assrstance for drsaster on trrbal land The purpose of the 
amendments were to lmprove response t1mes and recovery of drsasters in Indlan Country 
wh1le better respectrng trlbal soverelgnty Indlan Country had long requested these 
Page 4 of9
amendments so that trlbal natrons could drrectly access federal d1saster and emergency 
asslstance w1thouthav1ng to go through the state Governors There are numerous 
examples of tr1bal natlons encountermg dlsasters and 1t taklng months for the state to put 
a request 1nto FEMA, or for a Governor to deny the tnbal nat1on’s request and, therefore, 
no federal ass1stance was provrded Addrtlonally, fa1l1ng to allow dlrect access by tr1bal 
natlons to the federal government delayed rermbursements to the tnbal natrons, whrch 
would often result 1n further harm to other trrbal programs and servlces dur1ng a d1saster 
or emergency 
So, the PenobscotNat1on part1c1pated 1n the larger advocacy effort by Indran Country to 
Congress to pass amendments to the Stafford Act 1n 2012 that would allow tnbal natrons 
to drrectly pet1t1on the Presldent for d1saster and emergency declaratlons However, 
unbeknownst to the PenobscotNat1on, whrle the b1ll was pendrng 1n the Senate, the State 
reached out to one of the Mame senators and requested legrslatrve conﬁrmatlon that the 
Stafford Act amendments would not apply to the trlbal natrons w1th1n Marne srnce the 
amendments d1d not expressly mclude the Mame trrbes The result was a colloquy 
between one of the Mame senators and the b1ll sponsor conﬁrmlng thelr understand1ng 
that the tnbal amendments to the Stafford Act would not be applrcable w1th1n or to the 
State of Mame Accord1ng to the colloquy, th1s meant “that, even after the enactment of 
th1s leglslatron, 1f any of the tr1bes of Mame wrshed to obtaln a declaratlon from the 
Presldent that a ma] or d1saster exrsted, they would have to brlng the1r request to the 
Governor of Mame, who would have to conslder the request 1n accordance w1th exlstmg 
standards and procedures but who would retarn the d1scret1on to deny that request ”6 
After the Stafford Act amendments passed, PenobscotNat1on expenenced an 1ce storm 
that caused s1gn1ﬁcant damage to our commumty center, wh1ch housed our trrbal court, 
youth program, ﬁnance department and other tnbal programs FEMA sa1d 1t couldn’t 
work drrectly w1th the Tr1be because the Trrbe was not able to declare 1ts own d1saster 
declaratlon s1nce the federal law d1d not apply w1th1n Mame 
In early 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemrc h1t the Unrted States, the Penobscot Natron 
was not 1n1t1ally able to dlrectly access assrstance from FEMA We were told we had to 
work through the State, whrch was focused on the larger populatlon centers and obta1n1ng 
1ts own emergency asslstance from the federal govermnent Eventually, we got FEMA to 
work dlrectly w1th us and rgnore the prror hrstory of the State objectrng to the Stafford 
Act pr0v1s1ons applymg 1n Mame Add1t1ona1ly, we were able to advocate to Congress, 
along Wrth other trlbal nat1ons, for drrect federal asslstance through Congress ’ 
appropr1at1on of COVID relref funds to trrbal governments 
In 2013, Congress mcluded 1n the reauthorlzatron of the Vrolence Agamst Women Act 
(VAWA) an entrre t1tle on Safely for Indzan Women that restored back to tr1bal courts 
speclal domestrc vrolence cr1m1nal ]ur1sd1ct1on over non-Indlan offenders who commrt 
(1) domestrc vrolence, (2) dat1ng vlolence, or (3) v1olate a protectlon order on trrbal 
lands The PenobscotNat1on has long had a tnbal court and we helped to advocate to 
Congress for thrs restoratlon of l1m1ted cr1m1nal ]ur1sd1ct1on After the law passed, we 
6 158 Cong Rec S8274 (2012) (statement of Sen Susan CoI||ns) 
Page 5 of9
appl1ed to the U S Department of Just1ce to be chosen as one of the prlot tnbes to 
rmplement the specral domestlc vlolence cr1m1nal ]ur1sd1ct1on However, we were told by 
the Justlce Department that the State of Marne Ob_]€Ct6d to our appl1cat10n because sectlon 
16(b) of the Settlement Act prevented the tr1bal prov1s1ons of VAWA from apply1ng 1n 
Mame srnce Mame was not expressly mcluded 1n the law The Justlce Department d1d 
not want to get 1n the m1ddle of a _]ur1sd1ct1onal ﬁght between the State and Trrbe, so we 
were not chosen to be a p1lot pI‘O_]6C'£t1 ‘lbC and lost out on several m1ll1on dollars that 
would have strengthened our trrbal court and law enforcement and mcreased pubhc safety 
efforts w1th1n our commumty 
We then spent the next 9 years advocatmg to Congress to mclude language 1n VAWA 
makmg the tr1balprov1s1ons expressly appllcable 1n Ma1ne Th1s took a slgmﬁcant 
amount of t1me and resources, and eventually we were able to get Congress to 1nclude 
language 1n the recently enacted VAWA law 1n 2022 that speclﬁcally makes the trrbal 
provlsrons appllcable 1n Mame Smce Ma1ne 1s the only place where such a broad 
excluslon of Federal Indlan law exlsts, the congresslonal commlttees had a hard trme 
understandlng that we needed speclﬁc language added to VAWA 1n order for 1t to apply to 
us Congressronal staff thought language mcluded 1n the 2013 reauthor1zat1onlaw sayrng 
“Notwrthstandmg any other law” was sufﬁcrent for those trlbal provlslons to be 
appl1cable 1n Mame But, we had to explarn the language of the settlement acts and how 
our only optron for clarlty was to l1t1gate or ask Congress for to expressly add us to law 
We do not have the resources to consrstently advocate to Congress to expressly mclude us 
1n every federal b1ll rntended to beneﬁt the larger Indlan Country Educatmg each 
Member of Congress as to why we have to be expressly mcluded 1n legrslatron, unhke 
any other trlbe 1n the country, 1s 1ncred1bly drfﬁcult and trme consummg and requlres 
srgnlﬁcant ﬁnanc1al resources 
In December 2022, Harvard Un1vers1ty released a report descr1b1ng the economrc and soclal 
1mpacts on the Wabanak1 Natrons resultmg from the past 42 years of restr1ct10ns on the 
app11cab1l1ty of Federal Indlan laws 1n Mame 7 
A key ﬁndmg 1n the report was that per cap1ta 
mcome of other tr1bes 1n the lower 48 states grew by 61% between 1989 and 2000, but only by 
9% for the Wabanak1 Natlons Add1t1onally, the report found that the Wabanak1 Natlons 
contmued to lag far below the rest of Mame 1n 1mportant areas The per cap1ta1ncome 1n the 
Penobscot Nat1on 1s $18,809, whereas Ma1ne’s per cap1ta rncome 1s nearly double that at 
$34,593 Educatron atta1mnent rate for Penobscot people was on par w1th the rest of Mame, but 
the lack of well-pa1d _]Ol)S avallable to Penobscot people 1n our commumty 1s a s1gn1f1cant 
contrlbutor to the lag 1n per cap1ta mcome 
The Harvard report noted that the rest of Indlan Country has expenenced extraordmary economlc 
growth smce 1970 when Presrdent Rlchard Nrxon armounced a new nat1onal pol1cy of Indlan 
self-determ1nat1on that would focus on strengthemng trlbal natrons’ autonomy by lncreasmg 
opportumtles for educat1on, economrc development, and self-govemance Although Nrxon

announced the new federal pol1cy 1n 1970, the ﬁrst federal law enacted to begm lmplementatlon 
of thrs new pol1cy d1d not occur untrl 1975 w1th passage of the Ind1an Self-Determlnatlon and 
Educat1onalAss1stance Act (P L 93-638) The report found that by the end of the 1980s, 
“economlc development 1n Ind1an Country began to take root as tnbes bu1lt enterprlses 1n, for 
example, sk1tour1sm, hght Defense Department manufacturlng, forestry and wrldhfe 
management, hvestock and crop agnculture, and gamlng ” Tr1bal economres have cont1nued to 
grow over the decades, and the Harvard report found that th1s was pr1mar1ly a result of Federal 
pol1c1es of trrbal self-determmatron through self-govermnent The report concluded that Mame 
and the Wabanakr Natlons remaln an “outl1er” because of the State’s contrnued ﬁght to ma1nta1n 
the restr1ct1ons 1n the settlement acts Accordmg to the Harvard report, the Wabanak1Nat1ons 
and Mame have “no where to go but up” 1n terms of el1m1nat1ng the restrlctrons on trlbal self- 
determ1nat1on and self-govemance contalned 1n the settlement acts 
Solutrons to the Problems - 
The language of LD 2004 1s not someth1ng that was Just thought of thls year The language 1sa 
result of several years of research and dlalogue w1th the Mame Leglslature 
In 2019, the Mame State Leglslature establlshed a Task Force on Changes to the Mame Ind1an 
Clalms Settlement Act 8 The purpose of th1s Task Force was to revlew the varrous settlement 
acts and make recommendat1ons to the Leglslature on any suggested changes needed to the 
Mame Implementrng Act 9 Addltlonally, the Task Force was to develop leg1slat1on for 
consrderatlon by the Leglslature to rmplement rts recommendat1ons The Task Force completed 
1ts report 1n early 202010 and leg1slat1on was presented to the J o1nt Standmg Commlttee on the 
Jud1c1ary 
The Task Force spec1ﬁcally rev1ewed S6C'[lO1'lS 6(h) and 16(b) of the Settlement Act and 
the1r lmpacts on the Wabanak1Nat1ons over the 40 years srnce 1980 At the request of 
the Task Force, Suffolk Un1vers1ty Law School prepared a report 1dent1fy1ng potentlal 
federal laws precluded from applymg to the Wabanakl Natlons as a result of sectlon 16(b) 
of the Settlement Act 11 
The report rdentrﬁed approxlmately 151 federal laws passed by 
Congress slnce October 1980, and Wh1Cl1 may not apply 1n Marne 1f such law “affects” 
Ma1ne law These laws cover a range of toplcs and mcluded some II18._]01' laws mtended to 
beneﬁt Ind1an Country such as the Ind1an C1v1l Rrghts Act, the Ind1an Self-Determmatron 
Act, Amencan Ind1an Rel1g1ous Freedom Act, Ind1an Gamlng Regulatory Act, Natlve 
8 Materials related to the Task Force and its ﬁnal report can be found at https //leglslature maine gov 
9 Neither the Joint Order or the Joint Resolution establishing the Task Force intended any review of disturbance of 
the portions of the settlement acts that relate to the resolution of land claims or extmgulshment of aboriginal title 
None of the Wabanaki Nations involved in the Task Force sought lo have these provisions reviewed

The Task Force found sectlons 6(h) and l6(b) to be overly broad and had the potentlal to 
render 1nappl1cable 1n Mame all of the 151 federal laws passed by Congress for the

Mame Leg1slature amend the Ma1ne Implementmg Act to specrfy that, for the purposes of 
sectron 6(h) and l6(b) of the federal Settlement Act, federal laws enacted for the beneﬁt 
of Ind1an Country do not affect or preempt the laws of the State of Mame 12 The Task 
Force belleved that 1t may be poss1ble to render sectrons 6(h) and l6(b) of the federal 
Settlement Act moperable by enactmg leg1slat1on that afﬁrmatlvely prov1des, as a matter 
of state pol1cy, that federal laws enacted for the beneﬁt of Ind1an country do not affect or 
preempt the laws of the State of Mame Accordlng to the Task Force’s ﬁnal report, “such 
leglslatlon would el1m1nate the argument that apphcatlon of any federal law enacted for 
the beneﬁt of Ind1an country erther affects or preempts state law, because state law would 
speclﬁcally condone appllcatlon of that federal law w1th1n the State ”13 The Task Force 
recogmzed that draftmg leg1slat1ve language to 1mplement thls recommendat1on would be 
dlfﬁcult, but that domg so “W111 go a long way toward allowmg Ma1ne’s trrbes to ‘enjoy 
the same nghts, pr1v1leges, powers and 1mmun1t1es as other federally recognlzed Ind1an 
tnbes w1th1n the Umted States ’” 
LD 2004 seeks to 1mplement the recommendatlon of the Task Force but also begm to 
m1t1gate the slgmﬁcant harms caused by these two prov1s1ons 1n the settlement act 
Hmdslght over the past 42 years shows that the federal Interlor Department was rlght to 
express concems about the language of sectlon 6(h), and sectlon l6(b) has proven to be 
even more problematrc Enough research has been done to _]L1SlIlfy the need for the 
Leglslature to address thrs matter 
Govemor Janet M1lls’ ofﬁce has 1nd1cated that she would ob] ect to a categorrcal approach 
to maklng federal laws appl1cable 1n Marne because do1ng so would erode the settlement 
acts’ foundatlonal Jur1sd1ct1ona1 compromlse But, 42 years’ experlence w1th the 
settlement acts has shown that such]ur1sd1ct1onal compromlse 1s harm1ng Ma1ne’str1bal 
people and rural communltles The Govemor’s oﬂlce has sa1d that questlons of whether 
federal statutes should be made appl1cable 1n Ma1ne should be answered on a case-by- 
case b8.S1S so that the effects of each such dec1s1on on tnbal lands and ad] acent non-tnbal 
commun1t1es can be thoroughly evaluated and understood 14 
We strongly dlsagree wlth 
thls v1ewpo1nt because 1t contmues to ma1nta1n the current restnctrons 1n the settlement 
acts, whrch requ1re that the Wabanak1Nat1ons be speclﬁcally wrltten 1nto federal 
leglslatlon 1f the law would 1mpact the State’s _]l11‘1Sd1Cll1OI1 Thls status quo places an

Natlons should have to be specrﬁcally excluded from any beneﬁclal federal leglslatlon 
for 1t not to apply to us It 1s fa1rer for the State to explaln why we should be treated 
d1fferently than other tnbes under beneﬁclal federal Indlan laws versus us havlng to 
advocate to Congress merely to be treated the same as other tnbes The Governor ’s 
suggested approach contmues to g1ve the State v1rtual veto power over the app11cat1on of 
any federal law to the Wabanak1Nat1ons and perpetuates the lack of clarlty we have 
around the appl1cab1l1ty of such laws because the State can ralse aJur1sd1ct1onal objectlon 
at any tlme wlth no meanlngful Just1ﬁcat1on or need to show a harm caused to Mame 
c1t1zens or commumtles 
It 1s tlme for the State to stop treat1ng the Wabanak1Nat1ons as enem1es and start treatmg us as 
the partners and nelghbors that we are The Wabanak1Nat1ons have been on th1s land slnce tlme 
lmmemonal, and we are not leavlng Mame All we are asklng for 1s the ab1l1ty to govern the 
people, natural resources, and act1v1t1es that occur W1th1n the boundarles of our land We want 
the same thmgs as every commun1ty 1n th1s State economlc opportumty for our fam1l1es and 
safer and healthler commumtles LD 2004 W111 ﬁnally prov1de us some access to the full 
opporttm1ty to obtam that 
On behalf of the PenobscotNat1on and all Ma1ne c1t1zens and commumtles who have 
been harmed by these settlement act pI‘OV1S101’lS, I urge th1s Commlttee to take actlon on
