LD 2004
My name is Katherine Rhoda. I reside in Hiram. I’m writing in support of LD 2004.
I fail to see what public purpose is served by systematically excluding the tribes of 
Maine from federal legislation affecting each and every other federally recognized 
tribe. To single out Maine tribes in this way is unfair on the face of it and very 
burdensome to the tribes. To make an analogy, I’m glad my own town of Hiram 
doesn’t have to lobby to be explicitly included in each piece of State legislation!
To disadvantage the tribes in this way is also to disadvantage their neighboring 
communities. Please take this opportunity to correct the situation.
Thank you for your time, your attention, and your public service!
