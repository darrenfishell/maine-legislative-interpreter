Rev. Hillary Collins-Gilpatrick
First Universalist Church, Yarmouth
LD 2004
My name is Rev. Hillary Collins-Gilpatrick, and I serve as the Minister of First 
Universalist Church in Yarmouth. I am a  Brunswick resident and a life long Mainer. 
Please release the Wabanaki Tribes of the burden of the 1980 Settlement act and grant
them the same federally recognized footing that 570 tribes across the United States 
are given. This legislative change is embarrassingly overdue, and is supported 
enthusiastically amongst Maine residents and bipartisan leaders. The tribes in our 
state have long suffered restricted access to basic needs and a quality of life that 
enables them to thrive. The 1980 Settlement act has only furthered these restrictions 
and excluded tribe members from over 150 federally laws that would enhance their 
safety, health, and dignity. 
LD 2004 is an opportunity to amend this unsound and indefensible history that 
continues to this day. If you support the livelihoods and well-being of Mainers then 
you must support all Mainers - and that most certainly includes the Wabakani.  
In peace, hope, and progress,
Rev. Hillary Collins-Gilpatrick
