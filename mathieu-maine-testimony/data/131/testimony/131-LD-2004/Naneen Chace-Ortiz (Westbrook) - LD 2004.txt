LD 2004
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Naneen Chace-Ortiz, and I am one of your constituents. I live in 
Westbrook, Maine and I’m writing in support of LD 2004.
As a Unitarian Universalist, I believe in the inherent worth and dignity of every 
human being and in justice, equity and compassion in human relations. I am writing 
in support of LD 2004: An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneficial to 
Wabanaki Nations. LD 2004 would enable Wabanaki tribes in Maine to benefit from 
all federal laws passed to benefit tribes elsewhere, and would amend that portion of 
MICSA. I ask that you vote to pass LD 2004.
The Wabanaki tribes in Maine are treated differently than the other 570 federally 
recognized tribes across the country. Because of the 1980 Settlement Act, when 
Congress passes federal legislation for tribes nationwide the tribes in Maine must be 
explicitly written into the legislation, unlike the other federally recognized tribes. This
is an excessive burden to the tribes. They do not have the resources to track all federal
legislation and lobby Congress to have them included in each piece of legislation.
This legislation doesn’t circumvent the 1980’s Settlement Act. This legislation 
changes a provision in the Settlement Act that would at least begin the process of 
placing the tribes in Maine on the same footing as the other 570 federally recognized 
tribes. 
Please support LD 2004 to start putting the tribes and rural Maine on a path to 
prosperity.
Thank you.
