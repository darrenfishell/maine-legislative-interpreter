LD 2004
To whom it may concern:
I write to urge passage of LD 2004, An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws 
Beneficial to the Wabanaki Nations.   This bill has bipartisan sponsorship and support
and enables the Wabanaki tribes of Maine to access most of the federally beneficial 
Indian laws that the 570 other federally recognized tribes across the country are able 
to access.  
  Where is the logic, and more importantly the justice, in denying the tribes in Maine 
the access to federal benefits that would support their efforts to thrive on the land they
have stewarded for thousands of years?  Who better to partner with in caring for our 
communities and for this land we all love?  It is time to recognize the Wabanaki 
people as our neighbors and not our enemies. 
  Passing LD 2004 would be one small step towards acknowledging Maine’s long 
history of wrongdoing and broken relationship with the tribes.  It is time for Maine’s 
leaders to make this happen.  Please vote to pass LD 2004.
Thank you
