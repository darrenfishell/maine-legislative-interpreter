LD 2004
To the Honorable Chair and Members of the Judiciary Committee
I am writing in support of LD2004. This bill would allow Maine tribes to benefit from
most of the existing and future federal laws that apply to tribes in other states.
This bill will benefit Wabanaki Peoples and allow them an opportunity to  improve 
public health in their communities, respond to natural disasters , and promote 
economic  development. It is hard to see any down sides. 
Please support moving this bill forward.
Plea
