LD 2004
Today I am writing in support of LD 2004, it is time that the Tribes of Maine have the
same access to federal beneficial Indian laws passed by Congress that the other 570 
federally recognized Tribes have. Suffolk University published a report in 2019 that 
found 151 federal laws that have been passed that the Tribes of Maine did not have 
access to.
The Wabanaki Tribes of Maine have been treated differently than the other 570 
recognized Tribes across the country. The 1980 Settlement Act has produced an 
unusual relationship with the State of Maine that does not allow the Tribes to benefit 
from these laws that would help the Tribes in regard to economic development and 
needed infrastructure issues that are sorely needed.
This bill would enable the Tribes of Maine to take part in federally passed laws that 
would not only benefit them but also rural Maine. It has been argued that each piece 
of legislation should be passed on a case-by-case example. This would take decades 
and also prohibit the Tribes to benefit from much needed legislation such as the 
Violence Against Women Act (2013) that the Maine Tribes had to wait seven years in
Maine to be passed (2020).
This legislation changes a provision in the Settlement Act that would begin the 
process of putting the Tribes of Maine on the same footing as the 570 federally 
recognized Tribes. It has been agreed that the 1980 Settlement Act was intended by 
all parties to be fluid.
Personally, I will state that I have family at Indian Township. I have seen firsthand the
hardships that this limiting relationship has had vis-a-vis the state of Maine and 
Wabanaki Tribes. It is cruel and inhumane to disallow beneficial laws to not be 
enjoyed with subsequent growth potential for the Tribes of Maine and for my family. 
I support LD. 2004 so that we can right this provision and experience the growth 
potential inherent for all the Tribes of Maine as well as for rural Maine.
