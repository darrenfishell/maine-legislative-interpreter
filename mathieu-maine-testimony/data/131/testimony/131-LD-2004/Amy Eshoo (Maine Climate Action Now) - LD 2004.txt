P ASS
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
Honorable
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary ,
my
name
is
Amy
Eshoo.
I
am
a
resident
of
North
Y armouth
and
Director
for
Maine
Climate
Action
Now ,
a
statewide
coalition
of
16
grassroots
organizations
who
support
transformative
action
in
response
to
the
climate
crisis.
Our
work
as
a
coalition
is
to
center
equity
and
justice
in
climate
action.
W e
stand
in
solidarity
with
the
Penobscot
Nation,
the
Passamaquoddy
T ribe,
the
Houlton
Band
of
Maliseet
Indians
and
the
Mi’kmaq
Nation.
The
tribes
in
the
land
we
call
Maine
deserve
the
rights,
privileges,
powers,
duties
and
immunities
similar
to
those
of
other
federally
recognized
Indian
tribes
within
the
United
States.
It
is
time
to
begin
to
put
the
W abanaki
Nations
on
the
same
footing
as
the
other
federally
recognized
tribes
again.
W e
believe
that
for
Maine
to
face
the
climate
crisis
we
need
to
work
together
as
one
to
transition
towards
a
new
sustainable
and
rich
future.
But
we
can
only
do
that
when
everyone
has
their
basic
needs
and
security
met.
In
order
for
the
tribes
to
prosper
and
meet
their
communities’
needs
in
an
ongoing
and
sustainable
manner
they
need
to
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
federal
funding
made
available
to
the
other
570
federally
recognized
tribes.
Some
of
these
laws
which
have
passed,
that
the
tribes
do
not
have
access
to,
would
not
only
benefit
their
communities,
but
the
surrounding
rural
areas
and
communities
as
well.
Why
are
we
allowing
the
570
other
federally
recognized
tribes
in
49
states
to
have
the
benefits
for
their
tribes
and
states
and
not
Maine?
Over
the
last
30
years
the
other
federally
recognized
tribes
in
49
states
have
seen
economic
growth
of
61%
while
the
tribes
in
Maine
saw
only
9%.
It
is
apparent
that
the
lack
of
access
to
various
federal
funding
has
held
down
their
self-determination
and
economic
viability .
W e
believe
firmly
that
this
is
our
issue
too.
When
the
tribes
thrive,
Maine
will
thrive.
When
the
tribes
prosper ,
Maine
will
prosper .
I
urge
you
to
vote
OUGHT
T O
P ASS
for
LD
2004.
Thank
you.

Amy Eshoo
Maine Climate Action Now
LD 2004
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of the Committee 
on Judiciary, my name is Amy Eshoo. I am a resident of North Yarmouth and 
Director for Maine Climate Action Now, a statewide coalition of 16 grassroots 
organizations who support transformative action in response to the climate crisis. Our 
work as a coalition is to center equity and justice in climate action. We stand in 
solidarity with the Penobscot Nation, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Houlton Band of 
Maliseet Indians and the Mi’kmaq Nation. The tribes in the land we call Maine 
deserve the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other 
federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States. It is time to begin to put 
the Wabanaki Nations on the same footing as the other federally recognized tribes 
again.
We believe that for Maine to face the climate crisis we need to work together as one 
to transition towards a new sustainable and rich future. But we can only do that when 
everyone has their basic needs and security met. In order for the tribes to prosper and 
meet their communities’ needs in an ongoing and sustainable manner they need to be 
able to benefit from the federal funding made available to the other 570 federally 
recognized tribes. Some of these laws which have passed, that the tribes do not have 
access to, would not only benefit their communities, but the surrounding rural areas 
and communities as well. 
Why are we allowing the 570 other federally recognized tribes in 49 states to have the
benefits for their tribes and states and not Maine? Over the last 30 years the other 
federally recognized tribes in 49 states have seen economic growth of 61% while the 
tribes in Maine saw only 9%. It is apparent that the lack of access to various federal 
funding has held down their self-determination and economic viability. 
We believe firmly that this is our issue too. When the tribes thrive, Maine will thrive. 
When the tribes prosper, Maine will prosper. I urge you to vote OUGHT TO PASS 
for LD 2004. Thank you.
