LD 2004
To the Honorable Senator Anne Carney (chair), Honorable Representative Matt 
Moonen (chair) and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:
My name is Wayne Cobb. I live in Portland. Today I urge your Committee to vote 
unanimously OUGHT TO PASS on LD 2004.  
The Wabanaki tribes in Maine are treated differently than the other 570 federally 
recognized tribes across the country. Because of the 1980 Settlement Act, when 
Congress passes federal legislation for tribes nationwide, the Tribes in Maine must be 
explicitly written into the legislation, unlike the other Indigenous Nations in the 
country. With the Tribes not being able to access various federal funding their 
self-determination and economic vitality have been stunted. Allowing access to 
federal beneficial laws will not only benefit the tribes but also the non-Native citizens 
of rural Maine.
This legislation doesn’t circumvent the 1980’s Settlement Act. This legislation 
changes a provision in the Settlement Act that would at least begin the process of 
placing the tribes in Maine on the same footing as the other 570 federally recognized 
tribes. 
Please support LD 2004 and help us start putting the tribes AND rural Maine on a 
path to prosperity. 
Thank you.
