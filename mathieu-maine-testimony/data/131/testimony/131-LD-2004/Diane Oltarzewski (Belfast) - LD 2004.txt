Re: LD 2004 An Act to Restore Access to Federal Laws Beneficial to the Wabanaki 
Nations
There is no reason on earth why the Indigenous people of Maine should be excluded 
from the benefits meant for them, and no reason that they should be treated differently
from the other 570 Federally recognized tribes.
I write in wholehearted support of this act because it is long overdue. We must  undo 
the error and injustice of the last 43 years, during which Wabanaki tribes and nations 
have been wrongfully denied what belongs to them by virtue of the trust relationship 
between the Federal Government and Indian Country. Please vote unanimously Ought
to Pass!
