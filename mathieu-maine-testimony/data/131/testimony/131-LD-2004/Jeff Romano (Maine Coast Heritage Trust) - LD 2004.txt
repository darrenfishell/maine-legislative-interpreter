Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary committee, my name is Jeff 
Romano. I appreciate this opportunity to provide testimony on behalf of Maine Coast Heritage Trust in 
support of LD 2004. 
 
Maine Coast Heritage Trust conserves and stewards Maine's coastal lands and islands for their 
renowned scenic beauty, ecological value, outdoor recreational opportunities, and contribution to 
community well-being. We provide statewide conservation leadership through our work with land 
trusts, coastal communities, and other partners. Over the past five decades, we have conserved more 
than 185,000 acres in Maine. 
 
MCHT supports the principle of Wabanaki sovereignty embodied in LD 2004. Our position is grounded in 
more than 20 years of work with Wabanaki people on conservation of lands essential to the ecological 
health of the Maine Coast and the cultural traditions and a way of life that has sustained the Wabanaki 
for centuries.  
 
We encourage the Committee to seek an outcome for Maineâ€™s federally recognized Tribes based on 
mutual respect and fairness.
