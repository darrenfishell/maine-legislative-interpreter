members

Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
of fer
testimony
in
support
of
LD
2004
An
Act
to
Restore
Access
to
Federal
Laws
Beneficial
to
the
W abanaki
Nations
Pax
Christi
Maine
is
part
of
a
national
and
international
movement
working
for
peace,
justice
&
environmental
sustainability .
Pax
Christi,
meaning
“Peace
of
Christ”,
is
rooted
in
Gospel
nonviolence
and
Catholic
Social
T eaching,
which
includes
principles
of
human
dignity ,
care
for
God’ s
creation,
and
solidarity .
Support
of
right
relationship
with
our
W abanaki
neighbors
exemplifies
these
principles.
All
four
tribes
located
in
Maine
are
recognized
by
the
federal
government;
yet,
they
don’ t
have
the
same
rights,
responsibilities
and
opportunities
as
the
other
570
federally
recognized
tribes.
The
1980
Maine
Indian
Land
Claims
Settlement
Act
leaves
tribes
in
Maine
out
of
many
federal
bills
beneficial
to
the
other
tribes
in
the
United
States.
This
blatant
lack
of
equality
and
equity
must
be
corrected.
Not
being
explicitly
included
places
undue
financial
burden
on
the
W abanaki
tribes.
The
151
bills
benefiting
other
tribes
since
1980
have
included
legislation
on
health
care,
education,
housing,
economic
development,
environment,
social
welfare
and
other
areas
of
community
life.
A
recent
study
by
the
Harvard
Project
on
American
Indian
Economic
Development
shows
that
the
economies
of
tribes
in
Maine
developed
by
only
9%
between
1980
and
2020,
compared
with
61%
growth
for
tribes
in
other
states.
The
study
describes
many
potential
benefits
to
both
tribal
members
and
non-tribal
citizens
and
communities
in
Maine
and
very
few
possible
negative
ef fects
of
including
the
W abanaki
tribes
in
federal
legislation
designed
to
benefit
native
tribes.
It
is
clearly
understood
now ,
that
the
1980
Land
Claims
Settlement
Act
agreement
has
levied
a
negative
impact
on
Maine’ s
tribes.
The
negative
economic
impact
not
only
af fects
the
tribes
but
our
entire
State
as
well.
The
Maine
legislature
has
the
power
to
change
a
provision
in
the
Settlement
Act
that
would
begin
the
process
of
placing
the
tribes
in
Mai
ne
on
equal
footing
with
the
other
federally
recognized
tribes.
As
a
matter
of
equality ,
inclusion
and
justice,
Pax
Christi
Maine
supports
LD2004
to
start
putting
the
tribes
and
rural
Maine
on
a
secure
path
to
prosperity .
W e
ur ge
you
to
vote
“Ought
to
Pass”
on
LD
2004,
An
Act
to
Enact
the
Advancing
Equality
for
W abanaki
Nations
Act.
