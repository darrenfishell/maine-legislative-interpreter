Marilyn Roper
Houlton
LD 2004
My name is Marilyn Roper, a non-indigenous old lady (87) living in Houlton on 
traditional land of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians.
       PLEASE support LD 2004 because it it is  long past time to rectify the 
jurisdictional and economic injustices caused by the 1980 Maine Indian 
Implementation Act.  Parity with the other 570 federally recognized tribes in the USA
is a MUST - with shame on Maine for having the only federally recognized tribes that
have not profited from the 150 laws passed by Congress since 1980. 
        Perfect example of cutting off your nose to spite your face since all the other 
tribes have averaged  60% economic growth in the past decades vs. 9% for the 
Wabanaki.  This deprives the Town of Houlton!
