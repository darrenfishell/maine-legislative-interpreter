LD 2004
I am a resident of Swanville, Meredith Bruskin, FNP and I am writing in support of 
LD 2004. This act will not change the Settlement Act of the 1980's, but will at least 
begin the process of putting Maine's Tribes on an equal footing with the 570 other 
federally recognized tribes--a sign that we value our Tribes overall health and look to 
their success, financially, which will actually help all of rural Maine, as has been 
shown by recent studies. There is no excuse for all federally recognized tribes to have 
grown economically by 66% over the past decades, and Maine's Tribes remain at 9 % 
growth, as this is clearly attributed to Maine's Tribes not having access to federal law 
changes and benefits --this Act will be a step in righting this grave wrong. Thank you 
for y our support.
