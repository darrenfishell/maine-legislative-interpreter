LD 1387
To Honorable Senator Bailey, Rep. Perry, and HCIF committee:
Iâ€™m writing in support of LD 1387 from the standpoint of a Maine pediatrician of 
several decades. 
Many children miss or lack regular and sick care due to their insurance policies or 
lack thereof.  Each insurance plan has different coverage details, which can change 
yearly, and may be at odds with standards of good care.  Each change of coverage 
means new restrictions and rules for visits:  This may mean a gap in care, new and 
different  expenses, and even a change in covered prescriptions and  providers. 
Families are often confused and surprised, which  discourages the medical 
connection.  Furthermore, medical offices and facilities spend inordinate  resources 
chasing and clarifying these different and changing details on each patient.
A single payer system for children would solve these problems.  There would be 
assured  and predictable care available for the patients, and less overhead and 
frustration for providers.
Single payer care is the answer.  I encourage you to support this .
