Testimony of Dan Derneritt 5/9/23 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Opposition to LD 1387 
An Act to Ensure That All Maine Children Have a Healthy 
Start by Providing Single-payer Health Care Insurance to All Children 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Demeritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-profit insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people 
by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
Maine’s private and non-profit insurance carriers provide health insurance for Maine Children at 
more than twice the rate of MaineCare — 63.8% for employer-sponsored and direct purchase 
coverage compared to 31% for MaineCare or the Children ’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).‘ 
According to the Children ’s Health Care Report Card published by Georgetown University, 
95.7% of Maine children under the age of 19 have health insurance. Our insured rate among our 
youngest citizens is about a percentage point higher than the national average and ranks Maine 
23"’ out of 51 U.S. States and the District of Columbia? 
The Maine Association of Health Plans members support extending health insurance to every 
single Maine child. We oppose creating a single-payer program for children that would disrupt 
the coverage that two-thirds of Maine families currently provide for their kids. 
We would encourage the committee to consider the following: 
Insurance Transitions and Gaps for Young Adults: Young adults whose parents work for 
small Maine companies will lose five years of family coverage if LD 1387 becomes law. 
Maine businesses with 50 or fewer employees are g required to offer coverage for dependent 
children. They extend health insurance protection to their employees ’ families because it helps

attract and retain great workers? A state-based, single-payer program for all children could 
eliminate dependent-based coverage through Maine small employers. 
Employer-based dependent coverage extends to 26 whereas MaineCare eligibility ends at 21.4 
MaineCare Cost Shifting and Shortages: Transitioning more children into a program that pays 
less will increase pressure on providers and reduce access to care. Dentists sewing MaineCare 
patients get just 43 cents on the private insurance dollar.5 A single-payer program for kids will 
put even more pressure on Maine providers and create longer wait times and driving distances 
for families trying to access care. 
MaineCare Eligibility Gap: Nearly one-in-ten children who are eligible to participate in 
MaineCare or CHIP - 8.8% -- do not. Maine would take a significant step toward full coverage 
of children by focusing first on closing our existing eligibility gap." 
We urge a vote of Ought Not to Pass on LD 1387.
