Grace Raymond , Brunswick April 25, 2023 
Governor Janet Mills, House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, and Senate President Troy Jackson 
My name is Grace Raymond, I am from Brunswick and am a student at Bowdoin College. I am 
in favor of LD #1619, An Act To Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
I believe that pregnant Women, in coordination with healthcare providers, deserve the right to 
choose whether to have an abortion. This includes pregnant people Who have surpassed the 
current 24-week gestational ban. As we have learned over the past few years, life can change at 
the drop of a hat. From pandemics to natural disasters to mass shootings to ﬁnancial downturns, 
it is impossible to predict exactly What my life, your life, or our lives Will look like 24 Weeks 
from now. In the same way, a pregnant woman cannot see into the future to ensure she will be 
able to carry a child to term and care for a child ﬁve months after conception. 
The Turnaway Study conducted by UC SF found that pregnant people who are turned away from 
receiving an abortion are more likely to experience ﬁnancial hardship, stay With an abusive 
partner, and/or experience life threatening complications at birth. The option to have abortion 
care late in pregnancy is essential for a myriad of reasons. I trust that pregnant people Want the 
best for the future of their unborn child. I trust that pregnant people do not make the decision to 
have an abortion lightly. And I trust that as our legislature you Will give the right for women, like 
me, to make a decision that supports our Wellbeing. I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 
#1 6 19.
