LD 1619
My name is Rob Poissant and I live in Gorham, Maine.
I am a parent of two . My wife Deb had a difficult pregnancy and had a long period of
bed rest due to complications . The testing process included the possibility of 
Abortion if this would be favorable. Our son was born and is now a healthy 19 yr old 
attending U M O.who is a gift to us and has much potential to contribute to the 
well-being as a citizen of our State of Maine.
Every child born is a gift to each one of us. 
Expanding Abortion works in the opposite direction of welcoming and nurturing our 
future and well-being as a people. 
Please oppose Abortion expansion .
