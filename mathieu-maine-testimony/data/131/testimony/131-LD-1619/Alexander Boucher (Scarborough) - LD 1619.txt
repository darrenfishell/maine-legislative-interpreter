LD 1619
Madam Chairwoman, Mister Chairman, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee,
My name is the Reverend Alexander Boucher, and I am a Roman Catholic priest. I 
was raised in Biddeford and currently serve churches in the communities of 
Scarborough, South Portland, and Cape Elizabeth. I am writing today in opposition of
LD 1619.
I am writing because if someone has not personally known a child born prematurely, 
they might not realize how fully a person that child is. I was born over four weeks 
prematurely. Due to the care of skilled doctors and nurses and the courage and 
convictions of my mother, my life was saved.
I have seen statistics, and I am certain that you have as well, that 2/3 of Mainers do 
not agree with late-term abortion. Our own governor stated that she felt Maine’s law 
did not need to be changed. It may be easy to say “but what if there were a situation 
where the child’s life could cost the life of the mother,” and therefore stand idly by 
and refuse to take a stand on this issue. I am writing to speak about the lives of the 
babies destined to become healthy citizens with so much to offer.
Please oppose this unnecessary and drastic bill, a bill that the majority of Mainers do 
not want to see pass. Thank you.
Reverend Alexander R. Boucher
Scarborough
