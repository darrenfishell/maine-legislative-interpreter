Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Liane Bender and I am a resident 
of Auburn. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
It is an accepted fact that babies born several weeks before full term can survive 
and thrive. My own granddaughter was born at thirty-seven weeks, needed no 
oxygen, and is a healthy happy six month old. l can not imagine anyone 
purposefully ending her life. 
Whether one agrees or disagrees with abortion, our current bill allows fora 
woman to “choose” up to 24 weeks, and provides for later intervention should 
her health be at risk or her baby cease to live. 
A civilized society should respect life and care for those that are unable to care 
for themselves. Our responsibility is to encourage, teach and support our 
young, and to help them grow into mature individuals. By 24 weeks, a woman 
who is pregnant must learn to take into consideration the well being of her 
unborn child. Fear and uncertainty are natural, but that shouldn’t necessitate 
and validate ending the pregnancy. What can we do as a society to support 
them both? 
lf a child is born, released from the hospital and days later found dead through 
violence or neglect, we are horrified! How is late term abortion different? ln 
some manner, it is worse because the professionals who have trained to do all 
they can to support life, have actively participated in that child’s death. 
One might say that it is a woman’s right to choose - at any time during her 
pregnancy - and all responsibility for that decision lies on her shoulders. l 
disagree and say that if we, as a society, allow for late term abortion, the death 
of all late term babies rests on our collective shoulders. You have the unique 
power to vote for or against LD 1619. With power comes responsibility. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
