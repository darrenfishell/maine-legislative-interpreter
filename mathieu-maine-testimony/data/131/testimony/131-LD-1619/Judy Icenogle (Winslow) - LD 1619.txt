Testimony ‘ of Judy lcenogle 
In ogposition to “An Act to improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws“ --- LD 1619 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee: 
My name is Judy lcenogle, from Winslow, ME. l come before you today to speak in opposition to 
LD 1619. 
in the year 2020, only 1% of abortions in the United States were performed at more than 21 weeks 
gestational age. Fetal anomaly or life endangerment should be the only reasons such abortions are 
considered and current Maine law already allows for those two medicai necessities making it totally 
gratuitous to change Maine's reproductive laws. Making a law more permissive in its scope does 
not make it a better law. 
l am passionately pro-life and have prayed quietly and respectfully for many years, across the 
street from the abortion facility on Gabriel Drive in Augusta. As recently as March 16“ an Augusta 
Emergency Vehicle with paramedics aboard_was called to the Maine Family Planning facility to 
transport a client in need of additional medical care. As the paramedics left, a very worrie_d friend or 
family member followed closely behind the paramedics ’ vehicle. it was a good reminder of the 
inherent danger of abortion, especially second and third trimester abortions. 
Late-term abortion places women at greater risk of surgical complications, subsequent pre-term 
birth, and mental health problems, while simultaneously ending the life of an unborn child, a child 
capable of living outside the mother’s womb. 
Another concern l have is “the removal of criminal penalties ” as speciﬁed in LD 1619, which would 
allow unlicensed persons to perform an abortion after viability of the fetus, when it was not 
necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother, to go unpunished, just as is 
happening in cities all across our country where crimes are not being prosecuted 
Please vote NO on all three abortion bills (LD 1619, LD 1343 and LD 776). 
Thank you!
