Madam/ Mr. chair and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee
My name is Brian Hale and I live in Madison ME. I am a parent I of four adult 
daughters, two of which reside in Maine and two in other parts of the country. I’m 
testifying because I am someone who believes that words have meaning and the 
current use of the word “healthcare” has been completely hijacked by those who wish 
to bend the language to mean something that it clearly does not. The words health 
care when taken in context means to care for one’s health. This is an extreme bill in 
which the result of the practice permitted in this bill will not provide health care 
because the product or, byproduct of the procedure will be the body of a child tossed 
in a scrap bin. This is not healthcare this is practicing barbarism at its highest level. 
Many of our neighbors and I have joined the 65% of Maine residents have clearly 
voiced our opinion that we do not want abortions performed up to the last minute 
prior to birth. I beg you to hear the people of Maine that you have taken an oath to 
represent. We are asking that you represent all of us today by not allowing this bill to 
pass. Thank you for your time.
