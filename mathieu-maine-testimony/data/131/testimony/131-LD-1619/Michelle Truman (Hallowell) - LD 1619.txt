Michelle Truman
Hallowell
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Michelle Truman of Hallowell, and I am speaking in opposition to LD 
1619, "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws".
How this bill "improves" anything is questionable to me.  LD 1619 "changes the 
standard" of when to perform abortions, and "removes the criminal penalties" for 
someone performing an abortion without a license. 
LD 1619 does make it easier to get rid of a preborn baby, even to the moment of 
birth.....even for a healthy pregnancy.  However, the bill presents dangers for the 
woman herself.  If she happens to die during the abortion, and the abortion has been 
performed by someone not licensed to do so, what then?  NO ONE is held 
responsible.  That part has been deleted from the language of the bill!
The bottom line is that LD 1619 sounds like a convenient "C.Y.A. permission slip", 
which callously disregards the wellbeing of both babies and vulnerable pregnant 
women.
I strongly urge you to VOTE NO on LD 1619.
