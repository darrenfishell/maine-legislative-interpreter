LD 1619
Comments on LD 1619:
1.In its effort to accommodate difficult situations near the margins of current law, 
this bill weakens the viability standard.  A physician, however medically qualified, 
must recognize and balance with the "life and health of the mother" certain legal 
rights an infant begins to have past the threshold of viability.  It is said that a 
discretionary late term abortion, one for reasons other than medical health, do not 
happen, that this is not a realistic concern.  The proposed changes in this statute would
not only allow (or even encourage) such a thing but could make Maine a center for it, 
a place where people come to have it done. I don't think a majority of Maine citizens 
would be in favor of that. 
2.The bill removes or reduces the criminal penalties for performing an abortion 
without being licensed.  This feature of the bill is disqualifying.  It appears to say that 
practitioners must be licensed, but if they are not, well, don't worry about it. ?  If 
enacted as worded, it could have the effect of making Maine a center for unlicensed 
practice.  Again, I do not think a majority of Maine citizens would want that.
For the above reasons I wish to register opposition to LD 1619.
