Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Roseanna Young and I’m a resident of Edgecomb. I am here today to testify 
in opposition of LD1619. I am a Mother of two beautiful girls and the Nana to two 
handsome grandsons. I cannot imagine my life without them! I am here today to urge 
you to vote, “Ought Not To Pass” on Bill LD1619. 
This bill is far too extreme for Maine. I have seen statistics that report 65% of Mainers 
do not want late term abortion. I think that whether you are pro life or pro choice we can 
agree that aborting a baby at 9 months gestation is murder. Thinking about the pain that 
baby would feel brings chills down my spine! Some would argue that it is necessary in 
certain situations involving the health of the mother and I would say, the current law 
already makes provisions for medical necessity of late term abortion. 
Life is a gift from God and we should respect and care for life. We should also do 
everything we can to protect it from harm. I would like to leave you with a verse: Psalm 
127:3 “Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward." 
Again, I urge you to please oppose LD1619. 
Thank you, 
Roseanna Young
