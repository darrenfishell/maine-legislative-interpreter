RE LD1619
I am opposed to changing the existing Abortion Laws in MAINE  to extending 
Abortion on demand up to and until birth, Full Term Abortions.
LD1619 is a radical law in our Country.
I don't support LD 1619
What is a Right? A right is something that is correct, just, proper or honorable.
What is honorable in killing a baby in the womb?
A Testimony, serves as evidence.
I am evidence of life. We are all evidence of life. We live, we are alive.
Constitutional Rights:
The Right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
Women have rights, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Babies have these same rights, to be allowed life.
Wanted, expected, unexpected, desired or not.
What gives anyone the right to prevent a baby from their right to be born?
Yes, there are complex, complicated situations and there are life giving solutions to 
all of these situations.
Yes, there are financial complications, health complications, fears, interruptions in 
our lives, inconveniences, but those do not give us the right to kill, eliminate or 
otherwise make an inconvenient pregnancy, a baby, a life, disappear.
There is help even in our own beautiful State of Maine available to support, 
financially and practically, anyone in one of these situations.
We can support all life, and do.
Stopping a life, especially one that could be viable after 22 weeks, is not the answer.
Choose Life, choose Love.
