LD 1619
Why do people pick and choose what science they believe? A baby is a living human 
being and people are trying to make it legal to kill babies, for what reason other than 
inconvenience!? I oppose any bill that will make it legal to kill babies at any stage. 
LIFE - Life begins at conception. There is something miraculous that scientists 
discovered in 2016 when at conception there is a flash of light that sparks when a 
sperm meets an egg. Scientists and Doctors KNOW that babies feel things while in 
the womb so again, why do people ignore or deny that fact? Apparently it's easier for 
people to let babies be killed when they're so little and helpless because they haven't 
made a connection or maybe their fear is what allows them to be ok with killing 
babies. Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter! Babies are living people and we cannot
let them be murdered just because they can't speak for themselves. I strongly oppose 
this LD 1619 Bill and pray that my representatives do what is right and moral for 
once and block this bill from passing. Thank you for your time and God bless.
