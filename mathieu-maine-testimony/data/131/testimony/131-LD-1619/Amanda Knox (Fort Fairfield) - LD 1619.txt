Amanda Knox
Fort Fairfield
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary, I am Amanda Knox of Fort Fairfield, Maine, I am writing to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.  As a 
mother of four, I adamantly believe that all unborn children have the right to life and 
that abortion is the murder of a life.  Late term abortion is particularly heinous.  
Unborn babies in the second and third trimesters are fully formed; they are moving, 
living human beings who are capable of feeling pain and who are also capable of 
surviving outside the womb.  This bill would ensure that Maine would have one of the
most extreme abortion laws in the entire country, which is certainly not the Maine I 
want my children to live in.  I am strongly opposed to a bill that would allow fully 
formed, viable unborn babies to be killed in their mother's womb.
