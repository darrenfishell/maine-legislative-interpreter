Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary: 
My name is Silas Schrader, and I'm a resident of Pembroke. lâ€™m here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
This bill, LD 1619, introduces abortion on demand at any time during pregnancy in the state of Maine. To 
put this into perspective, this means that abortions can be done on the same day the child would be 
conceived, which means that the child's right to live and not to live is separated by mere seconds. 
l will not dwell long on the barbarity of this procedure, like how, for instance, the child has to be torn 
apart limb by limb until the head is reached, at which point it is smashed so that it will be small enough 
to be pulled out. Or how this bill allows unlicensed physicians, in other words, your average Joe, to 
perform these procedures which is very dangerous for the mother. I have chosen to refrain from going 
into detail about any of these points because everything I wanted to say has already been said by others 
who have spoken before me. 
Instead, l have a question. How many well thought out, educated testimonies have to be spoken before 
the people's voices are heard? To those few Democrats and Moderates who are in the legislature who 
are listening, though I know many are not, will you hear the people's voice? l don't personally knowa 
single pro-abortion individual who is for this extreme legislation. This bill simply goes too fan I appeal to 
the consciences of this committee against what deep down we all know is wrong. Please vote against LD 
1619. 
Thank you.
