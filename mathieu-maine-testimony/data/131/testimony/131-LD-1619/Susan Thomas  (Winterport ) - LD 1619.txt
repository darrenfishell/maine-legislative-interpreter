Susan Thomas 
Winterport 
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Susan Thomas and I am a resident of 
Winterport. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619 because I believe in the 
sanctity of life. Abortion at any time, for any reason is too extreme for Maine. This 
bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed and making 
Maine one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country. Please oppose this 
unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want see pass. Thank 
you.
