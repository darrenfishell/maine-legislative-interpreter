LD 1619
This bill , LD 1619 is not a compassionate or humane answer to the needs of woman 
who find themselves in a position where they are considering an abortion, especially 
an abortion where the life of their child is at 24 weeks gestation and older.
    My name is Vickie Brochu and I live in Gouldsboro.  I am the mother of 5 grown 
children the youngest who are twins born at 30 weeks and who are now 30 years old.  
     To take the lives of these unborn, mostly developed babies is infanticide and a 
society that allows this for the "health" fo the mother is denying the truth of the real 
consequences of how abortion forever damages the health of the mother and denys a 
voiceless human being the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   I stand 
in support of the voiceless and help to the woman in crisis to give their child life for 
the future of Maine and the world.  
    I sa;y NO to advancing abortion accessibility, loosening liability for abortion 
providers, and diminishing protections for the vulnerable.
