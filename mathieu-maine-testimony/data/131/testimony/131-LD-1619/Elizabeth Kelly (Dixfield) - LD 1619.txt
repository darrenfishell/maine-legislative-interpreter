LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:  
My name is Elizabeth Kelly, and I’m a resident of Dixfield. I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619.
 
Late term abortion , also known as second trimester abortion, is done on a fully 
developed fetus prior to birth. The current law in Maine allows for "termination on 
demand " without medical reason until "viability ", which is approximately 24 weeks. 
In Maine, a new proposed bill, allowing for abortion into the second trimester, and 
prior to birth is extreme. The United States (along with the countries of China, North 
Korea, Singapore, Netherland, and Canada) allows for abortion in some states. 
Late term abortions should not be legalized as it takes an innocent life and 
compromises the health of the mother. The unborn, in many cases, are chemically 
euthanized causing pain. The mother undergoes painful delivery which at times is 
unsuccessful resulting in excessive blood loss which can have catastrophic results. 
Abortion should NOT be a form of birth control, and should not be seen as such. 
Currently there are approximately 1.2 million abortions performed each year in the 
United States.  Abortions should not be taken lightly and seen as the new norm.  
Killing an innocent human being is taking away their rights as a child, and an adult, to
their future which has value. 
To be honest, I can not comprehend why we're actually at this point in human history.
Late term, second trimester abortion, and expanding the abortion laws, is an atrocity, 
and in my opinion, is not what Maine citizens are about.  Do not allow this to happen. 
Please vote not to pass LD1619.
