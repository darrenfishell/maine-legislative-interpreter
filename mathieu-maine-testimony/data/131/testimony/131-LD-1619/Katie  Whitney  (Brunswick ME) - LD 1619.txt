Thank you all for your time. 
I just want to say to each and every one on this committee that your life is worthy of 
you having, and it was no less valuable when you were conceived, and it was 
certainly no less valuable when you were an 8 lb. baby about to be born. Please do not
allow this bill to pass. It will be the most shameful choice our state could make and I 
beg you not to allow it.
