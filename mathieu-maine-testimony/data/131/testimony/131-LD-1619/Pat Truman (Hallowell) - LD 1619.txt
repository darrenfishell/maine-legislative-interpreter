LD 1619

Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Pat Truman of Hallowell, and my comments will be relatively short.  I 
am opposed to L.D. 1619 because it is the most severe and barbaric attack on LIFE 
that this body has ever witnessed.  Even those among you who are liberal and 
pro-abortion must acknowledge that L.D. 1619 is a “bridge too far”.
To legalize the killing of an unborn baby – right up to birth – is a reality too horrible
to even contemplate……yet, this is what you are being asked to do.  No amount of 
logic can sanitize this proposed legislation.
The influence of Planned Parenthood is certainly manifest here!  Their leadership 
has been a strong catalyst in pursuing this type of legislation.  By influencing key 
Legislators, they try to create a false sense of compassion for a pregnant woman — 
but nothing for her innocent baby.
However, back in the day, their method of operation was far more clandestine.  
Their mantra was:  “Abortion should be safe…..legal…..and….. rare.”  My, how that 
compassionate position has changed.  Now it’s:  “Abortion — any time…any 
reason…any medical professional.” 
This loosening of medical standards should be a source of concern to everyone, 
because we might tragically learn that the unborn baby isn’t the only victim here.  
Judiciary Members, do not be a party to this. 
 Vote NO on L.D. 1619.  Because if this bill goes through – our condemnation of 
the Aztecs and their gruesome practice of child sacrifice is sheer hypocrisy!
