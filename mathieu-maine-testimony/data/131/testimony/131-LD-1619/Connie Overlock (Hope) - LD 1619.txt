Connie Overlock
Hope
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Connie Overlock, and I am a resident of Hope. I am writing to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619.
I am writing on behalf of the unborn and the women who will experience harm to 
their bodies if this bill passes. First of all, life begins at conception. But even if you do
not believe that, you must know that allowing abortion up to the time of birth is taking
away an innocent life. These lives should have a chance to grow and make their own 
choices. These lives deserve a chance to thrive in a community of people who respect 
the value of life. These lives are children who  will be the next statesmen, Nobel 
Peace Prize winners and great innovators of the future. They cannot speak for 
themselves, so let us speak for them.
In addition, removing penalties for abortions done by anyone other than a medical 
professional will cause more harm to women and could potentially leave them sterile, 
or with permanent bodily damage.
Maine already has an abortion law that goes far beyond what I believe it should. 
Please don’t allow the expansion to include the ability to get an abortion up until 
birth. Infanticide - which includes children in the womb - should be outlawed at every
stage.
Please vote “ought not to pass”.
