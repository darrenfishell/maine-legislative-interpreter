LD 1619
I will keep my comments brief and to the point as I know you all are very busy and 
will be hearing from many citizens.
I am a business professional here in the State of Maine.  When I heard about this 
proposed bill I thought I was being misinformed.  After I read the proposed changes 
in LD 1619 I was in shock that we could even be discussing this kind of a change.  
That we would even consider taking the life of an unborn child up to the point of 
birth.  This to me doesn't even pass the common sense test.  This goes way past the 
point of viability of life other than the life and health of the Mother. The sections 
listed in the amendment should not be removed.   
 
I am an above average earner here in the State of Maine.  If we actually go down this 
road and pass this kind of legislation, which I believe to be barbaric, I will move my 
family and my tax dollars to another State.  I believe many others will do the same.  
At the least, we will vote for representation that represents our core beliefs. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
