Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
Thank you for your careful consideration of those who oppose the bill that would 
extend the the legality of aborting full term babies. 
The state of Maine must have a legal system that values and protects all life, mothers 
and babies. These lives, often the most vulnerable in society, must be given protection
from a culture that seeks to devalue and dehumanize them. 
The state of Maine and this bill will most likely target the poor who have less access 
to alternative choices and are most often counseled to choose abortion. This bill will 
target young women who can not fully understand the long term emotional and 
psychological effects of aborting your baby. And this bill will further the current 
zeitgeist that tells society that there should be no consequences for our behavior. 
Thank you for your consideration 
Respectfully,
