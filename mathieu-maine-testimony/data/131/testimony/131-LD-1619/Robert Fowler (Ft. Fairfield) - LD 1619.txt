My wife and I got married in 1990. After being married for a few years we wanted a 
family and soon discovered we are unable to have any.  This was very hard on us, 
especially seeing teens we knew getting pregnant.  Eventually we went thru the 
process to adopt a beautiful little girl from China.  China at the time had a one child 
policy so many children were being aborted.  My daughter is amazing and has forever
changed my life forever as well as brought us so much joy, love, happiness, and at the
same time challenging me to be a better person. I will forever be blessed by my 
daughter’s birth parents for giving her life.  There are a lot of families out there that 
cannot have children of their own and would be great parents if just given a chance.  
Please vote NO on LD 1619 and allow these children to have a life, keep in mind 
these children are our future and someone’s hopes and dreams.
Thank you very much.
