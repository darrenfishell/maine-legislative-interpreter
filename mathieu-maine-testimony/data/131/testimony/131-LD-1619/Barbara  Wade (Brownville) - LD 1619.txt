LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Mooen and members of the Maine Judiciary 
committee:
My name is Barbara Wade and I am a resident of Brownville. I am testifying in 
opposition to LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
We have always been told that abortion should be safe for women. If it's illegal then it
will be performed by people who aren't doctors, in unsafe environments, and women 
will die. Now our state is trying to pass a bill to protect those who are unlicensed 
physicians who perform them? Abortions come with a long list of possible risks and 
complications. This bill is not safe for women. It certainly isn't safe for the unborn. 
Expanding abortion to include babies who can survive outside of a mother's womb is 
tragic and with no definition of what a "necessary" abortion is, they could deem the 
sex of a baby or a possible disability as a "necessary" reason to end a pregnancy. Life 
is precious. Whether it's the life of a mother or an unborn baby. Please protect them 
both from this horrendous bill and vote ought not to pass.
