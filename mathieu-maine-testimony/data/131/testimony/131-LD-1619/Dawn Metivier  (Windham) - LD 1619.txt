LD 1619
Members of the committee,
I am highly opposed to LD 1619; abortion on demand at any time for any reason. This
is an unethical and immoral piece of legislation. It does reflect who Mainers truly are. 
As everyone knows, there are good days and bad days. Sometimes things appear very 
dark one day and not so bad the next. One day there is no help, no solutions and the 
next day the clouds clear and help arrives. Being pregnant brings many types of 
emotions and many of these are in exaggerated form. In this. Case, it is a final 
decision with no turning back. Only tears, pain, and regret that lasts a life time. I 
know firsthand. I would never make that choice today as I now know there were 
better options. Killing a viable child is murder. Plain and simple. I don't want Maine 
to be known for this heinous act. Please vote no on LD 1619. Thank you.
