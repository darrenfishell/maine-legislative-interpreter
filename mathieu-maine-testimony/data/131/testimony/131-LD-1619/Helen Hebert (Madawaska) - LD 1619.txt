Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: My name is Helen Hebert, and l'm a resident of Madawaska, Maine. 
I'm here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. l am a parent of ﬁve children and nine 
grandchildren. I have one daughter that is a Midwife at Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Maine. 
My family understands the value of life. We lost a granddaughter to Leukemia at 5 months and 
four days of age. Every day of life counts and we are thankful for the memoires that will last usa 
lifetime. Her 5 months and four days brought more joy to our family that I could ever put into 
words to you today. 
Again, I am testifying today in Opposition of LD 1619. This is the most EXTREME bill on abortion. 
Abortion is taking a life of a baby that has no voice. As a young woman l had two miscarriages 
that were devastating to me and my husband. These pregnancies represented life in the womb, 
not just tissue. l was heartbroken as l saw parts of my baby that were already formed. Their 
little hands and eyes were like webs as l was in my ﬁrst trimester. 
Human life is precious and l believe that God himself is the only one that should determine the 
outcome of every life conceived. This bill would make Maine one of the most extreme states 
allowing abortions to this degree. I stand here before you on behalf of these babies that have 
no voice. 
Most Mainers don't want to see this bill pass. Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
