It seems that one question is necessary: why ought this bill be before the legislature? 
This is just another divisive wedge issue policy that we do not need as a state. 
Shouldn’t we be focusing on helping our poor and despairing after COVID, and not 
dodging the issue with a non-solution? Shouldn’t we be encouraging childbirth and 
community care for pregnant women in an aging population such as ours? Joshua 
Chamberlain, our governor in 1866 (roughly 250 years ago) mentioned the same 
population problems we have chronically had since then, now with only double the 
population in 250 years. We ought to encourage and expand responsible, socially 
supported childbirth. Why should we expand access to abortion up to (but not yet 
including) the point of birth with no questions asked? I cannot think of one person 
that this would help, given that we have medical exceptions to our viability cutoff for 
medical reasons. However, I can think of many that this bill would harm, as in the 
thousands of unborn human beings with detectable heartbeats and fully functional 
nervous systems; with which they can feel all the pain and brutality of the inhuman 
process of abortion. I urge you to vote your conscience and not what our partisan 
party system has unfortunately made a platform issue.
Thank you for your consideration,
