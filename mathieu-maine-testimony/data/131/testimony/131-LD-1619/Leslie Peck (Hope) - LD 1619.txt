“…Even if it only saves one life!” 
This was a phrase that Maine politicians and leaders crammed down our throats as 
they sought to close schools, shut down the economy, impose vaccine mandates, etc 
during covid. 
“Black lives matter!” 
Another catchy phrase used by the Left to convince us that they real do value life. 
But it’s clear that *unborn* black lives don’t matter at all to the Governor and 
lawmakers in Maine who are pushing this unspeakable bill. It’s also clear that “saving
just one life” doesn’t apply to a human being unless you’ve already been lucky 
enough to take your first breath.  
In Maine, it’s impossible to know “which” lives matter because whether it’s 
slaughtering babies or euthanizing the elderly…our radical leaders in Augusta keep 
moving the goal post to decide who should live and who should die. 
You might smirk when you hear all of our protests and think them silly and 
frivolous…but lawmakers, your judgement day will come whether you believe it or 
not. Your smirk will be replaced with the full weight of an eternity realizing all of us 
were right and you were wrong.
