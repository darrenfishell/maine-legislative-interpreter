LD 1619
Chair and Judiciary Committee Members:
I am a retired nurse, and live in Farmington.  I have witnessed the birth of babies and 
have marveled at the miracle of and reflected on the endless possibilities for these 
new lives.  It deeply saddens me today that we are contemplating a bill that would 
provide abortion in our state up to birth for any reason.  In the name of this extreme 
right to choose, I am convinced we are disregarding the right to life for defenseless 
babies who cannot speak for themselves.
This bill is extreme, heartless, and cruel.  It is a denial of our humanity and decency.  
I believe it is evil, it is murder,it is short sighted, and will forever negatively impact 
Maine and those who live here.  If this bill is passed, Maine will be among the states 
with the most permissive abortion rights and will open our state to travel here 
specifically to obtain abortions.  A majority of Maine voters do not support late term 
abortions.
Please vote NO on LD 1619.  Thank you for this opportunity to testify in writing.
