LD 1619
I am asking the committee and other legislators to vote NO on LD 1619. 
Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine. Every single life is 
important, especially those who cannot speak up for themselves. Have you ever 
stopped to think about this: What if you had been that aborted baby? You wouldn't be 
here today! So make a difference in our world the right way. Be a voice for the 
unborn who, if given life, could be given the opportunity to make a difference in our 
world.
I strongly feel that this is NOT how Maine should lead our country. Do what is right 
and please vote no on LD1619.
