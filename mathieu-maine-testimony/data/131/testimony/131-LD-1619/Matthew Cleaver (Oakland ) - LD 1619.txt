Matthew Cleaver
Oakland 
LD 1619
Honorable representatives, my name is Matthew Cleaver from Oakland, Maine. I am 
strongly and earnestly urging you to vote against bill LD 1619.
Abortion is murder of a living human baby. That is bare scientific fact, and no matter 
how many arguments you may be given otherwise, you will remember this and know 
it deep in your soul every time you think about how you vote on this matter.
Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine. That’s NOT “the 
way life should be.” We should be known for our lobster rolls and beautiful 
lighthouses, not for how easy it is to kill babies before they are born.
This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. 
Healthcare providers are supposed to “first do no harm,” yet now killing healthy 
babies is up for consideration with this bill.
Maine would have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country. Again 
I ask you, is our enthusiasm for murdering babies really what we want our state to be 
known for?
We don’t need any new bills to protect procedures necessary due to tragic 
complications or circumstances. Medical necessity is already covered by current law.
Focus on making better quality healthcare available for women, without using that as 
an excuse to allow babies to be murdered.
Vote for life. Vote against LD 1619.
