LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws 
 
Oppose 
 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary 
Committee.  My name is Peter Vachon.  I’m a resident of Scarborough.   
I submit my testimony  in opposition to LD 1619 – An Act to Improve 
Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
 
If Maine wants to become abortion capitol of the world, this bill is well 
on the way to changing Maine’s motto from vacation land to abortion 
land.  It seems that Maine cares more about endangered wildlife than it 
does for unborn children.  This bill brings complete shame to our 
beautiful state – please kill this bill before it kills Maine’s future.  This 
bill is a total embarrassment to our beautiful state of Maine.
