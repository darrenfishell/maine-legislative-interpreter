LD 1619
 Speaker Talbot Ross and members of the Judiciary committee,  I, Diana Laing of 
Searsmont oppose the bill and am asking you to reject this bill LD1619. This bill 
condones the murder of a viable human for any reason. The portion of this bill that 
erodes the standards that the medical personnel performing the procedure are held to 
(no liability) will not protect the patient to any errors either. Maine will be known as 
the abortion capital of the world. - not a title that we would be proud of. Thank you 
for this opportunity to submit this statement.
