Madam/ Mr. chair and honorable members of the 
Judiciary Committee 
My name is Karen Hale and I live in Madison, ME. Our 
country is divided and Angry. When we are angry, we 
tend to make unnecessary and bad decisions. Not only is 
the decision to have abortions to the point of birth 
immoral, but it is also a knee jerk reaction to a change in 
the Federal law. I want Maine to be seen as a State, that 
continually does what is right. Choices have 
consequences and ones made quickly are usually not 
sound. lam a veteran, l am a wife and a mother of four 
adult children. I have experienced the agony of 
miscarriages and Ô¨Ånally, l have a grown child that was 
born with a severe heart defect. This child grew to 
become a college athlete who excelled in soccer and 
basketball. This journey is not easy, but every child is 
precious. Just because you cannot hear the unborn 
screams and feel the baby's pain, does NOT make it right. 
l want to be a voice to stop the baby's pain. Let us open 
our arms to the joy of holding these babies.
