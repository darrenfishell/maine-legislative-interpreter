My name is Kayla Burke from Machiasport. I am currently 15 weeks pregnant with 
my third child. I have seen our precious child moving on an ultrasound screen and 
heard her heartbeat. At 15 weeks a baby in utero is already making facial movements 
as well as sucking and chewing movements. Hair is staring to form on their body and 
they have flexible hands and feet that are moving constantly. They brain and internal 
organs are developing at a rapid rate. As soon as that child is conceived it is a life and 
a human. Passing a law that allows women to abort their babies at any stage is murder
of a living precious little baby. This bill is unconstitutional and inhumane. We need to
protect these babies while they are in utero just has much as we need to protect them 
when they are out.
