LD 1619
I am Brian Swartz, from Hampden.
I am testifying against LD 1619, a bill that would allow unborn babies to be killed up 
to the moment that they were born. To kill babies who would be viable outside the 
womb is an abomination; this bill would place Maine among the few states that allow 
such horror to be inflicted on babies who could otherwise live if allowed to be born.
I ask that the Judiciary Committee vote LD 1619 as "ought not to pass."
Thank you very much.
