In Luke 1:42 Elizabeth says to Mary (mother ofJesus) And she spake out witha 
loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy 
womb. 
Blessed is the Fruit. You---me---we are the Fruit of the Womb! 
Psalm13913 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my 
mother's womb.14l will praise thee; for l am fearfully and wonderfully made: 
marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.15 My substance was 
not hid from thee, when l was made in secret, 
My Children are not my own, they were knit together by the great physician the 
great creator; I am not my own I was knit together by the some and so were you. 
We are merely the caretakers, entrusted with God's Children. 
Consider these things! 
All Living, blessed is the fruit of the womb, Fearfully and wonderfully made, knit 
together and marvelous works!
