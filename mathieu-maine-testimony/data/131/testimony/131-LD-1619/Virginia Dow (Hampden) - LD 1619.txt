Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my 
name -is Virginia -Dow and l am -a »l—-lampden resident. 
l oppose LD 1619 because I have held babies born before the point of 
viability, both as a mother to them and as a photographer for Now l Lay 
Me Down to Sleep. This non-profit organization provides heirloom portrait 
sessions to families of pregnancy and early infant loss. l have looked into 
those babies faces, counted their fingers and toes and seen firsthand the 
evidence of human life before birth. This is a picture of Larson and Emmett 
Dow, my identical twins born September 19, 2016. They were 18 weeks3 
days gestation. 
Current Maine laws already allow for abortions up to the point of viability 
and abortions after the point of viability to save the life of the mother. LD 
1619 is an unnecessary change that removes specified conditions of 
aborti.on.s. And then further removing.criminal.penalties to unlicensed 
individuals performing abortions. This allows for more unnecessary loss of 
life by increasing potential maternal death, along with infant death. 
Mainers deserve better. 
Thank you for your time.
