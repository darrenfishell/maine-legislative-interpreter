Good
morning,
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Committee
of
Judiciary.
My
name
is
Allen
Sarvinas
of
Topsham,
and
I
am
submitting
my
testimony
in
opposition
of
LD
1619
"An
Act
to
Improve
Maine's
Reproductive
Privacy
Laws."
In
2018,
Governor
Mills
won
the
election
while
campaigning
to
oppose
the
corridor.
Immediately
upon
taking
ofﬁce,
Governor
Mills
fast
tracked
signing
the
corridor's
contract.
During
the
off
year
election,
I
signed
a
petition
to
put
the
corridor
to
a
referendum
and
as
I
did,
the
women
said,
“maybe
we
do
have
something
in
common”.
I
said,
“when
a
politician
blatantly
lies,
that’s
something
we
should
come
together
and
support
holding
them
accountable.”
In
2022,
Governor
Mills
won
the
election
while
campaigning
to
maintain
current
abortion
laws.
Why
is
this
legislator
perpetuating
an
intentional
act
of
deceiving
Mainers?
As
an
originalist,
LD
1619
is
so
far
beyond
any
intent
of
our
constitution
it’s
fascinating
to
witness
the
effectiveness
of
weaponized
herds.
It
is
inconceivable
that
the
framers
intended
constitutional
protections
for
abortion
as
a
“fundamental
right”,
meaning
LD
1619
is
violating
our
US
constitution.
As
a
constitutionalist,
Maine
has
the
right
to
decide
if
terminating
a
baby's
heartbeat
in
the
womb
is
legal.
Personally,
LD
1619
is
one
of
the
most
accurate
measures
of
how
out
of
touch
Maine
policies
are
from
the
majority
opinion
in
the
state
which
is
why
Governor
Mills
lied.
Abortion
is
a
fail
safe;
not
birth
control.
We
are
to
empower
life
and
women.
There
are
no
situations
in
which
women
are
not
capable
of
providing
life
and
concurrently
ﬁnding
happiness
and
success.
LD
1619
is
a
lobbyist
policy
feeding
a
shallow
herd
in
which
99%
have
no
association
with
abortion
besides
their
feedback
loops
and
social
networks.
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Committee
of
Judiciary,
I
urge
you
to
remain
in
lockstep
with
the
current
and
very
liberal
Maine
abortion
laws
by
voting
ought
not
to
pass
for
LD
1619.
