LD 1619
I oppose LD1619 vehemently. I am a former sidewalk helper who has seen many 
women need assistance to walk out of the building. To remove the criminality of 
abortion at any time is logically inconsistent, but to do so after the point of viability 
and for any reason deemed necessary is to nullify the safe rare and legal and make it a
wide open welcome as a form of birth control. People will state ‘you don’t know how 
hard a decision it is for the mother’. I would point out 2 items in that sentiment. 
Mother. That means this person is already a mom. That child is truly their child as 
they sit and grow in their mothers womb. And hard decision. Why is it hard? Because 
it truly is a human. People will say fetus but what is the scientific and legal word fetus
mean. Offspring. And what type offspring is in question? Human offspring. This is a 
human child! I oppose this bill of child sacrifice on the alter of virtue signaling and 
human desires and you should too
