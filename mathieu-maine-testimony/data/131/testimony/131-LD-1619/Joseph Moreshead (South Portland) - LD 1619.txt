An Act to Improve Maineâ€™s Reproductive Privacy Laws LD 1619
Oppose
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Joseph Moreshead from South Portland, Maine. I come before you today 
to in opposition of LD 1619. 
LD 1619 would legalize abortion up until the time of birth. Abortion is the killing of a
fetus. Murder is the willful killing a human being by a private person. If the fetus is 
human, and I have yet to see good evidence that they are anything but, then abortion 
is an act of murder. I say this not as an emotional appeal but only as a logical 
application of a definition to a particular instance. I do not want to live in a society in 
which murder of any kind is permitted, nor do I believe the Judiciary Committee 
does. It is wrong and should be actively opposed by our society and our government. 
Late term abortion (which this bill proposes to allow) only illustrates the nature of 
abortion more vividly. Reflect for a moment on seeing a newborn baby. It is obvious 
to most people that that baby should be protected from harm. Reflect further that this 
bill would permit the same baby to have been killed only moments before because it 
changed location from inside the womb to outside. No essential change happened in 
what or who the baby was. There was a baby before an after, not a clump of cells one 
moment and human person the next. To most people, late term abortion would clearly
be an act of murder, but that is what we are proposing to allow. 
In order that we can live in a society in which murder of all kinds is frowned upon, I 
urge opposition to LD 1619.
