LD 1619
I write in opposition to LD1619. I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY LEGISLATION 
WHICH NORMALIZES OR INCREASES ACCESS TO ABORTION, 
ESPECIALLY LATE TERM/FULL TERM ABORTIONS. 
The United States Constitution acknowledges the right to life which is endowed by 
our creator. It is a fundamental right which cannot be taken away by man or woman. 
Murder is "the crime of unlawfully and unjustifiably killing a person," as defined in 
Merriam-Webster dictionary. Murder is not only a crime, but a sin.
LD1619 Ought Not Pass!
