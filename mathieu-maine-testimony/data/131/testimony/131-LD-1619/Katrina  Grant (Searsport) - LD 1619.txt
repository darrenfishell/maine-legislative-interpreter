If we can determine that life ends with a heart beat, how can we not determine that it 
begins with a heart beat. A mothers womb is suppose to be the safest place for a baby,
why has it become a politically endorced war zone for such precious life. My mom 
was asked to abort me. I am forever grateful she chose life. My life. My life matters, 
and so do all babies lives. Please do not let this pass. Protect the innocent, even when 
the world has gone mad. Take a stand for what is right. God sees all that we do, I pray
we do what is right today.
