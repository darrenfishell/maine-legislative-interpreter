Members of the Maine Legislature: 
      We write today in regard to LD 1619 with the sincere hope that you will ultimately decide to vote 
down this extreme piece of legislation. Regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice,  allowing 
abortions up to the moment of birth, even in healthy pregnancies, is far too extreme for Maine.  
     Maine is very rural, mostly small-town communities with many traditional values that have been 
instilled for generations. Trying to change us to be more extreme than California or New York, which this 
legislation will do, is not the job you campaigned on or were elected to do  .Polls show that most 
Americans do not agree with late term abortions. A June 2022 Harvard/Harris poll of Americans showed 
that 70% of Americans oppose abortion after 15 weeks at most, and only 10% support a policy that 
would allow abortion up until birth, as LD 1619 does.  
We understand that there are concerns about the life and health of the mother, and we share these 
concerns with you. However, this bill is not the way to address this issue. We respectfully ask that you 
do the right thing, and please vote this bill down. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
The members of the Penobscot County Republican Committee
