LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Kristen Saunders and I am a resident of
Otisfield. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619.
I am a public school teacher of 17 years, and I have had the privilege of teaching 
hundreds of young children in our state.  I have watched students learn and grow to 
their fullest potential.  I  have seen them grow up and live out their hopes and dreams 
as productive citizens in our communities.   I strongly believe in the lives of the youth
of our state, and that these children are our state's future.  As a teacher I have learned 
the importance of advocating for my students.  Many times they do not have anyone 
to speak up on their behalf, to speak up for what is in their best interest.  Now, I am 
speaking up for our state's youngest children, children at the age of birth.  These 
children deserve their lives to be valued even at birth.  If we do not stand up for their 
life and the potential it could hold, who will.
To have a bill that states an abortion at any time for any reason is extreme, and is 
cutting off the precious potential these citizens will have for a future in our towns, 
schools, communities and state.
Please oppose this unnecessary law.  It will be one of the most extreme in our whole 
country, and  I do not believe that my fellow Mainers want this bill to pass.  Thank 
you.
