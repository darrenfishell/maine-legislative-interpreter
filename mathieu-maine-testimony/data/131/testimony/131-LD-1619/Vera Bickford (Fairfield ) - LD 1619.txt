As a tax paying citizen  of  Maine and  a supporter of life, I object to this bill . The 
murder of a child/infant at any stage of development is in itself punishable.  That we 
would even consider killing an infant up to its birth is an evil no one should  be part 
of.  If this is what the govenor believes is a good choice then God have mercy on her 
soul.
