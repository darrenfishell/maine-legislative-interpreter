Daniel Wirtes
Kennebunkport
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Judiciary 
Committee, my name is Daniel Wirtes and I am a resident of Kennebunkport Maine. I
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619.
I am opposed to a bill that would allow a baby that could survive outside of the womb
to be killed.  It find it very difficult to believe that a bill like LD 1619 is even being 
considered.  As the oldest of eight children that grew up in poverty and for a period of
time on state welfare. I value the life of my siblings and the good job my mother did 
in loving and caring for us.  I am grateful that my mother chose life for us. When I 
married Becky I became related to four adopted relatives and a stepfather to 6 year 
old twins. Life was chosen and again I am grateful.  I am asking the members of this 
committee to not support LD 1619 an extreme bill that would make abortion available
at anytime and for any reason.
Thank you,
Dan Wirtes
