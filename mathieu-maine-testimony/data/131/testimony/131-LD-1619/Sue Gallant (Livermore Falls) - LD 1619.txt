Testimony in Opposition to LD 1619 
Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary 
Committee. My name is Sue Gallant and I reside in Liverrnore Falls. I am writing today to 
present testimony in opposition to LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine ’s Reproductive Privacy 
Laws. 
I am asking you to oppose this legislation because I think every baby should have the right to life 
and this legislation allows for any reason and without accountability for taking the life of a child 
up until birth. Psalm l39:l6, “Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me 
were written in your book before one of them came to be.” The safest place for an unbom baby 
should be in their mother’s Womb. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sue Gallant
