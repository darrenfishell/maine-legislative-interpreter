LD 1619
I, Candis Bradford, oppose the proposed bill LD 1619.  I believe that life begins at 
conception.  Murder is defined as premeditated killing of one human being by 
another. To abort a baby is premeditated, therefore murder.  This bill to allow 
abortion after viability is outrageous.  The bill states that the State not restrict a 
women’s exercise of her private decision to terminate a pregnancy.  What about the 
right of the child in which she carries?  What if that child is female?  I am using my 
voice to speak on behalf of those children whose right to live will be taken away. I 
believe our efforts shouldn’t be used to propose bills like this, but in ways to provide 
help and resources for mothers, babies, and families.  We can do better than this.  We 
must do better than this.
