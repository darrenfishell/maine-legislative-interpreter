To the respected members of the government of the State of Maine,
I bear testimony today as an ambassador of Jesus Christ, the King of kings. My appeal
to you is not based on emotion or cliches, but rather on God, Who you will stand 
before on Judgement Day. 
As we look to the bill in front of us, what is being considered is not just a matter of 
reproductive privacy. Let us strip away the mask and look at the truth of the matter. 
Abortion is murder. Every human being, from the moment of conception, is an image 
bearer of our Creator God. God has commanded "You shall not murder". Just as a 
man has no right to privately abuse his children, women have no right to privately kill
their babies. In the state of  Maine, children are being starved to death and torn apart 
in their mother's wombs. This is a modern day holocaust and the government has 
given approval to this atrocity. 
For every one of you who approves this bill, I testify to you that your deeds do not 
escape the sight of Almighty God. He hates the hands that shed innocent blood and 
He will punish this evil. I solemnly warn you to flee from the wrath of God. Repent, 
turn from your evil ways, and turn to Jesus Christ.
To those who are fighting to protect the lives of the unborn children, thank you.
I plead with you to stand for justice, to stand for life. The lives of children are at 
stake, it is your duty to protect them. Oppose LD1619. 
In Jesus' Name, no more abortion in our state.
