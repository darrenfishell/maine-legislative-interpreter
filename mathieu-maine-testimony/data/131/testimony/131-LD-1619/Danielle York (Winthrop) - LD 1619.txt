I implore you to vote no on this bill. For the sake of the babies growing, fully 
dependent on others to protect them and to stand for their lives. I am pleading on 
behalf of these children who have no voice. I gave birth to my youngest three months 
ago. I felt him moving in my womb from 14 weeks gestation up until he was born at 
39 weeks when I could see him making those same movements. These babies have a 
right to life and you have taken it upon yourselves to strip them of that right. I can 
think of nothing more heartless and evil. Do what is right and stand for them.
