Barbara Forrest
Lincolnville
LD 1619
Speaker Talbot Ross and members of the Judiciary committee.  I, Barbara E. Forrest 
of Lincolnville, oppose bill LD 1619.  I was present at the State House yesterday, 
May 1st, and can attest that there were hundreds of others present that also feel the 
same way. This is a horrible bill being proposed.  When a viable baby can be aborted 
for whatever reason, can you truly call this anything but murder? I think not! Iâ€™m 
thankful to have this opportunity to submit this statement.  Thank you.
