LD1619 Testimony 
My name is Ella Clark, I live in Winslow and I am here today to say that every human
life has value. That life begins at the moment of conception. Under no circumstance 
should any human being be dismembered , sucked up a tube, or euthanized because it 
is inconvenient for them to live. We as a society are blatantly lying to women in 
telling them abortion will empower them, but especially to both of the parents, by 
telling them the best thing for them to do is to kill their child if it is unwanted or an 
inconvenience. Abortion is murder, hidden under the name of “women’s rights” or 
women’s healthcare, and we will not stand for it. I would like to ask all of you, Why 
are you alive today? It is because God created you with a purpose and value, and each
of your mothers made the decision to give you the opportunity to live your life. Why 
is it acceptable in any way that we deny any other human that basic right to life? This 
bill is immoral and dangerous. We do not want legalized murder in Maine. Please 
vote Ought not to pass on LD1619
