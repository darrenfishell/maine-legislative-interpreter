Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Brittany Monaghan and I ama 
resident of New Gloucester. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. I am 
speaking on behalf of Shannon Van Dyke who is a registered Nurse in Lewiston 
who had to work today. 
I am a mother of two young children, and I work with closely with mothers who 
are considering abortion. 
Abortion at ANY time for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine! 
One of my biggest concerns with this bill is the fact that the provider decides what 
is a medical issue "worth" aborting. 
There is so little guidance on this. 
Doctors should not have that kind of power. 
Why? Because now doctors are judged not on their medical ability, but on 
“patient satisfaction" . Don't believe me? 
It's hospital policy to have the manager review every "grievance" with the person 
who reported it AND the provider. 
Which means if the provider gets poor satisfaction ratings, they get pulled into 
the office... Which then puts pressure on the provider to give the patient 
"whateverthey want" . I've seen it happen. . 
Also, the OBGYN offices are completely overworked and understaffed. I have 
patients who need medical attention but can't get in to see the OB fast enough. I 
Wait-lists kill. So by allowing this bill to pass, you're allowing delayed care because 
"they‘ll get to you eventually." If an abortion truly is medically necesary, then this 
NEEDS to be discovered sooner than the 3rd trimester for the mental health and 
physical safety of mothers. V
