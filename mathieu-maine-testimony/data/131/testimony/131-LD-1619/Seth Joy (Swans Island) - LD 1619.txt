I’m not one to write letters or contact legislators but I cannot be silent. I must be a 
voice for those who can’t speak for themselves. The millions of unborn who if given 
the choice would cry out Let me live !  I guarantee if given the choice all would 
choose life . 
   In order for society to function we must as a people respect life. All life and life 
from its very beginning. We have learned a lot over the past 50 years since Row V 
Wade and we can no longer as a people be ignorant to the fact that there is a life 
inside the womb. As I write this letter my wife is nine months pregnant. My very 
active baby girl is about to join this world. I am saddened and sickened that I live in a 
state where potentially so many like mine will never be given that opportunity for life.
 I plead with our Governor and every legislator to please vote and support life.
