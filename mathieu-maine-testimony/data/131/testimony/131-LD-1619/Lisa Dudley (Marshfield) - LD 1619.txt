Lisa Dudley
Marshfield
LD 1619
Members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for taking the time to hear my 
testimony today regarding LD1619. My name is Lisa Dudley, I am a resident of 
Marshfield. I am 46 years old and a mother to 8 sons- by birth and adoption through 
fostering. My life has not always been so full of life- at the age of 17 I got pregnant, at
first it was exciting and full of plans for the future; however, several weeks went by 
and my boyfriend had a change of heart. He did not feel ready to be a dad and his 
parents offered to pay for me to have an abortion- I agreed thinking this would save 
our relationship. I cannot express to you the emptiness I experienced in the days to 
follow. I honestly thought I would just have a simple procedure and move on with life
- I couldn't shake that emptiness. By age 19 I was pregnant a second time- my life was
anything but settled and this time I decided that I wasn't ready to be a mother. Sadly,I 
left that clinic with the same emptiness I had experienced just 2 years earlier. Just 2 
short years later I got to experience giving birth to my first born son. My thoughts of 
the 2 children I didn't allow to grow and have a chance at life were heavy on my 
mind. I think many women are afraid of what they think they can or cannot do and 
this option of abortion is there. Had I never been influenced to have the first abortion I
do not believe I would have even considered the second. I greatly oppose LD1619 and
ask you to please consider the women and lives that will be affected by this extreme 
bill.
