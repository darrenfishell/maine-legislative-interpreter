Honorable members of the joint committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Pamela Cates and I live in Cutler. lam a parent of 3 children and 18 grandchildrenl am 
testifying in opposition of LD 1619, the bill advancing late term abortions. 
l\/ly daughter had a miscarriage at 12 weeks. lt happened at her home, in her bathroom. I vvas with her 
during this experience and when it was over we held this tiny baby...about 1 1/2 - 2 inches....lt vvas sad 
and amazing at the same time. amazing because this baby had arms, legs, fingers, toes a head 
everything a normal baby at that age would have. Sad because this baby died from complications 
with the cord that was connected to his mother. sad because we never got to meet this perfect little 
baby. l cannot imagine allowing a doctor to perform an abortion for a baby bigger 02' older than this 
'12-week baby. lt was a traumatic event to lose this baby atil2 weeks and l cannot imagine makinga 
decision to abort a full grown baby. l cannot believe anyone could think this is ok. This bill is so 
extreme! An abortion at ANY time for ANY reason is too extreme! Please oppose this drastic bill that 
so many |\/lainers do NOT want to see pass.i

Thank you.
