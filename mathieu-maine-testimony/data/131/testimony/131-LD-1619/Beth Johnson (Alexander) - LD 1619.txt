LD 1619
Greetings to the Judiciary Committee,
I am writing to request that you vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1619 and other related
bills. If you are not familiar with Kermit Gosnell, I urge you to research his case 
before you vote. 
The ambiguity of this bill and the current condition of DHHS in Maine will result in 
the same situations women faced under the care of this man.
Please, please take a few minutes to consider my request.
Thank you for your time.
