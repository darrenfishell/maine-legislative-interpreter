LD 1619
My name is Kim Hall and I am a resident of Skowhegan Maine. My profession is that
of a registered nurse. I am a believer in Christ and the Sanctity of life. Please consider
my written testimony against LD 1619. In Exodus 20:13 it tells us you shall not kill. I 
am a gasped that we in the State of Maine are considering abortion right up to term. 
The baby is a living breathing being created in God's image. It has a heartbeat and 
moves its fingers and toes. The other part of this bill that is horrifying to me is that a 
non-medical person can perform an abortion. The effect of abortion with be with the 
mom for the rest of her life. The pain of abortion itself may go away unless the person
performing the abortion botches it up totally. Maine we are better than this!
