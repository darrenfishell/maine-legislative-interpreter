Madaml Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee. My name is Sarah Heuveline and l live in Turner. I ama 
mother myself of two little boys. l am testifying today in opposition to LD 
1619.This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be 
killed. This is inhumane and extreme. What is life? When is it valuable ’? 
Life begins at conception when cells begin to rapidly divide through a 
process called Meiosis. At just 6 weeks a baby has a heartbeat. Birth 
doesn't magically make you a human being. 
Doctors now consider 22 weeks the earliest gestational age 
when a baby is "viable" or able to survive outside the womb. My son was 
smiling and sucking his thumb in his ultrasound image atjust 32 weeks. 
When l look at that ultrasound picture it is evident that he was a fully 
formed child with intricate details of 10 fingers and 10 toes. It is terrifying to 
think that with LD 1619, it would make it possible to dismember the arms 
and legs of a perfectly healthy baby through abortion. 
Most women that consider and get an abortion are scared and for 
good reason. Abortion has become a bandaid to the real problem that our 
state has of not supporting parents well. WlC benefits should include 
diapers and wipes, there should be paternal paid time off, there should be 
maternity homes for those suffering from domestic violence just to namea 
few. Women that are in a tough situation should be offered another option. 
And there are other options to offer aid such as Safe Families, Safe 
Voices, The Root Cellar, Saint Mary's Nutrition Center, Care Net 
Pregnancy Help Center of Mid-Coast Maine, Sofia's House- Center for 
Wisdom‘s'Women, and ABBA Women's Choice Pregnancy Consultations 
are just a few to name that Maine could offer more support. 
The "right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" begins with LIFE 
itself.
