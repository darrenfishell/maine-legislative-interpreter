I believe this expansion of abortion "rights" to be not only unethical but down right 
evil. regardless of religious beliefs we all should agree that it is murder to kill  9 
month old babies. How can we justify murdering babies up to the moment of birth? 
While I don't agree with early abortions for rape, incest, those with disabilities , I can 
see why someone may support abortion in those circumstances. This bill tho is 
legitimate murder. Anyone voting in favor of this is no better than mass murderers. 
Pushing for these bills is backing many on the pro life side into a corner to defend the 
lives the innocent. Having been a pro choice person and left wing progressive for 6 
years and then leaving those ideas behind, I get where many on both sides are coming 
from. Now I believe that nothing is more worth making sacrifices for than standing 
for the right to live. In 100 years abortion should be remembered as a dark period of 
society. I will work harder than ever before to defend life. Peaceful sacrifices have to 
be made when the lives of many are at stake. Over 63,459,000 lives have been lost so 
far , how many more do we have to tolerate? We must dismantle the pro death 
industry. My suggestion is we as a society focus on prevention of unnecessary 
abortions with more access to birth control, subsidies and incentives for sterilization, 
and teaching the value of life. Please stop this bill and be on the right side of history.
