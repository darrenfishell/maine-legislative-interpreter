Please vote NO on LD1619
This bill is extreme.  I would hope that you could follow the science and know that 
human life does begin at conception, and all human life has value.
There is an age of viability (after 24 weeks) that this human being, this person, can 
survive outside of the womb.  So why is it being decided that taking that person's life 
is okay?  This isn't about taking away women's rights, which has become a 
tremendously manipulated narrative, but about the value of all human life, 
personhood, that we are all responsible for - having a wholistic view that supports  
human rights and dignity, for the unborn as well as born.  We, as individuals and a 
society, lose that view when we become the deciders of who is of value and when 
their value begins to matter.  So please vote NO on LD1619
