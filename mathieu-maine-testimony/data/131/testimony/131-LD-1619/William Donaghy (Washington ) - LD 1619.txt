William Donaghy
Washington 
LD 1619
To the members of the Judiciary Committee and all legislators for the state of Maine- 
I implore you to vote not to pass on LD1619. 
You know as well as I do that abortion is not “reproductive health care.” A woman’s 
family physician or gynecologist can most certainly provide reproductive health care.
Abortion is the murder of an unborn child! All the euphemisms you employ will not 
change that.
