Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Amber Hines and I live in Bradford. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. Almost two 
years ago now, my one year old daughter, Beatrice, died just minutes after I got her to the emergency 
room. Doctors, nurses, technicians, and specialists swarmed into action around her. Within a few more 
minutes they had her heart restarted and a machine breathing for her. Those individuals that night gave 
their all to save my daughter ’s life; they are heroes. 
Over the next two days doctors continued on their mission to keep Bea alive. They collaborated with 
the best minds to figure why she was failing and what they could do to save her. Nurses worked twelve 
hour shifts to tend, care for, and monitor her. They poured themselves out; they are heroes. 
On day three my daughter ’s kidneys began to fail. Time was critical and the Bangor hospital had no way 
to do dialysis on a baby. Again doctors scrambled to communicate and coordinate sending Bea to 
Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Life Flight of Maine was quickly scheduled to fly her to Portland by 
helicopter. A pilot, a flight nurse and a flight paramedic safely transported her with the utmost care to 
Barbara Bush. They are heroes. 
In the intensive care unit at Barbara Bush, Maine Medical, intensivists, nephrologists, pulmonologlsts, 
respiratory specialists and an entire army of support people and nurses focused their attention on my 
little Baby Bea. Over the course of two months they brought her right back around to a healthy happy 
little girl. They are heroes. 
It is amazing the knowledge, the drive, the grit that people in the medical community have and pour out 
to those at their most vulnerable, people in a position of needing a hero. 
This is your chance to step into their shoes and save the lives of babies we just haven't met yet. Please, 
dig down, step up, and be a hero. Thank You.
