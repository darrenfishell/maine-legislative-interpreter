LD 1619
Good afternoon, 
Please accept this testimony on LD1619. I am writing as a Maine resident, American 
taxpayer, and a mother. LD 1619 ought not to pass. 
Maine has some of the most lenient abortion laws in the country. mills stated during 
her campaign, she would not change anything. So we should not even be here, 
discussing this drastic change. 
If this passes, perfectly healthy, viable, innocent little babies will be murdered. There 
will be no limits, no reasons, and no humanity. Maine is a wonderful state, it should 
not become a place where people travel to murder innocent babies because we have 
no limits. 
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1619.
