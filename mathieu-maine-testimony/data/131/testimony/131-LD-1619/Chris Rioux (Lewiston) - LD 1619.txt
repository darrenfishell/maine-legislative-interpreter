I would like to recommend that LD1619 ought not to pass. 
 
Regardless of the different reasons that a woman may feel pressured into ending a pregnancy she 
has carried to a later term of pregnancy, the scientific reality is that the fetus is a distinct human in 
development – distinct anatomy, distinct blood type, distinct DNA, etc… 
The observable phenomenon that it can react to stimuli on its own, feel pain, and survive outside 
the womb, should make the dismemberment and/or destruction of the fetus for any reason 
unthinkable! Such actions are a barbaric solution and are indefensible in a modern civilized 
society. 
Don’t let Maine become an “abortion tourist” state! The child deserves to be protected, and the 
mother deserves access to alternate solutions whenever she finds herself seeking to end her 
pregnancy. 
Thank you
