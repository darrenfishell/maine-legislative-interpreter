The following bills ought-NOT-to pass:
LD 776
LD 1343
LD 1619
Margaret Sanger one of the pro eugenicists of the past century is likely rolling in her 
grave as to the extent of what is being proposed; the possibility of ending the life of a 
viable infant. 
Holocaust survivor -
"One witness described how Josef Mengele ripped an infant from its mother`s womb, 
then hurled it into an oven because it wasn`t a twin as he had hoped." Is that's what's 
next?
If this bill passes, it will reinforce the culling of the minorities in this country.
Thank you.
