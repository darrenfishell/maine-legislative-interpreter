Elizabeth  Pagliaroli 
Bath
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary,
My name is Elizabeth Pagliaroli, I am a resident of Bath and I am testifying in 
opposition of LD 1619. I am a mother of 3 little girls and my middle daughter was 
born pre mature. She was born just shy of 36 weeks and was born a healthy, beautiful 
girl that didn’t need any help breathing or living. She was the size of my other 2 
babies that went full term and were also born healthy! This bill would allow a baby 
that could survive outside the womb to be killed.
IF I got in an accident on my way to the hospital, hit by a drunk driver and me and my
baby didn’t survive. The drunk driver would be charged with vehicular manslaughter. 
But with this bill.. the mother would be able to kill her baby at the same gestation age 
and it would be legal and considered ok?! This is beyond wrong and evil. 
I have talked to many Mainers that are pro choice and they are even outraged by this 
bill saying “this is going way to far”.
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
see pass. Please vote ought not to pass.
