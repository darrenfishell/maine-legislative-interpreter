As a mother, I feel that my life has no greater calling than to protect. 
From the moment that I found out I was pregnant, I was overcome with the 
responsibility to protect the life inside of me. And when I lost that life at 12 weeks 
gestation, the devastation was enough to shatter my world. I know, through 
indisputable science, that life begins at conception. There is no right time to terminate
life. A life is not any more or less significant depending on the gestational age. 
Speaking on behalf of the pregnant mother, there is also indisputable science that 
proves that there is no justifiable reason for an abortion. The only “cure” to life 
threatening situations for the pregnant mother is birth. Whether the life inside her is 
born alive or not alive, the outcome of the mother’s health does not change. Contrary, 
the life of the innocent is forever changed. 
Life is too precious. Life is too valuable. Please join me in the fight to protect the 
most vulnerable.
