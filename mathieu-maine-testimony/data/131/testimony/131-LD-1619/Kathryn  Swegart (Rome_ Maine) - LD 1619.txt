Last month a friend revealed the disastrous effects abortion had on her life. Here is 
her story.
When she was 17, she became pregnant and told her parents. It was my friend’s desire
to keep the baby. Her parents disagreed, put her in their car, and they drove to an 
abortion clinic. At 21 weeks’ gestation, she wanted to keep her baby, but her parents 
would not listen.
She lay on the operating table and the saline solution abortion began. She remembers 
the unborn child thrashing in her womb, fighting desperately for life. The baby lost 
the battle.
She gave him the name Phillip, and my friend still mourns his loss. As she told the 
story, fresh tears flowed down her cheeks. You would guess that the abortion 
occurred this year. In fact, the abortion took place 47 years ago.
Abortion not only takes an innocent human life, but it also causes life-long trauma in 
the woman. My friend also stated that her mother regretted her part in the violent act 
and drank herself to death.
Abortion is not health care. It takes a human life and harms women physically, 
emotionally, and spiritually.
