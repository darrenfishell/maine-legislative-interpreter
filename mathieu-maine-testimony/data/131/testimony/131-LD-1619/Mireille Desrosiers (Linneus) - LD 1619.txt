LD 1619
     As the judiciary committee of Maine, you are entitled to protect the rights of 
human beings, i.e. the rights to life, liberty, and property. I beg you, therefore, to 
defend the lives of the unborn by voting down Bill LD 1619. If the bill passes, 
abortion will become more easily accessible and rampant. We lose the precious gift of
a human being every time an abortion occurs and end some person's world. Have 
sympathy for the Body of Christ, already beaten at Calvary; it becomes more 
mutilated with each abortion. Please have compassion on the poor babes so vulnerable
in the womb. Thank you for your time. God bless you all.
