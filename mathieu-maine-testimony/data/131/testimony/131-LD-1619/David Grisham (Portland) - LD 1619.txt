Dear Sir or Madame,
     The matter of abortion has always been a human rights issue, and only secondarily 
a political one.  I dare say that it affects the woman more even than the child; the child
dies in a brief horror, but the woman may carry the trauma with her for decades: an 
unforeseen consequence of "freedom".  The physical, emotional, and spiritual trauma 
that women & girls experience in the abortion process, however it's carried out, 
remain with most of them; this has never been acknowledged by the culture at large, 
despite the availability of testimony.  I myself could well have been aborted, after my 
mother had an affair with a married man, had she not had access to an easy adoption 
alternative.
     Since the onset of ultrasound technology the lie that what dwells within a woman's
womb is only a clump of cells is no longer sustainable;
the great number of women originally pursuing abortion, then changing their minds 
when observing the growing child within them, is proof.
      After the assisted murder of more than 60 million human beings by a medical 
community sworn to do no harm, and the briefly mentioned 
damage to women & families, as the representatives of the Whole state of Maine, I 
implore you to hesitate to cross the line of unrestricted child sacrifice and long 
consider the consequences to women & families of such a "choice".  May the Lord 
guide you.
                                 David Grisham
