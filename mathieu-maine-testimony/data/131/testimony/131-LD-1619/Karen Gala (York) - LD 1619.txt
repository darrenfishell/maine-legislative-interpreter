Karen Gala
York
LD 1619
To the honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Karen Gala.I am a resident of York .I a a mother, grandmother and RN.I 
am testifying today in opposition to LD1619.
I have been a nurse for 40 years.Most of my experience has been in maternal child 
health and Labor and delivery .I can understand the view many in support of this bill 
hold," my body my choice".I also hold the view that we as a society should always 
support aid and protect the most vulnerable in our society. The unborn child falls into 
this category . Instead of pushing fir this barbarically practice of terminating an 
unborn child up to the time of birth, we should be offering our fellow sisters 
compassion , guidance, support and other options (adoption).iI am adding you all to 
vote against LD1619.Thank you
