LD 1619
My name is Cheryl Carlson and I live in Lisbon Falls. I oppose LD 1619 with 
everything within me.
36 years ago I was 17 years old at the beginning of my senior yr of high school and 
pregnant. I am so thankful that I was made aware of the atrocities of abortion at the 
age  of 12 by Right to Life. Because of that knowledge there was no choice for me 
when I read the pregnancy test. It did not say to me that I had a choice. It told me that 
I was going to have a baby. I was scared of all the unknown ahead. It was one of the 
hardest things I've ever walked through. This made me stronger and I set out to help 
other women in this same situation. People argue that those of us who are prolife don't
care about the mother. I care and many others do as well. I put my heart into action to 
create a nonprofit home for women who are pregnant and have no place to go here in 
Maine. I believe life begins at conception and every child has the right to live. My 
oldest daughter who came into my family through foster  care at the age of 14 was 
pregnant at 19. She also chose to have her baby. Her daughter, my granddaughter, 
was born at 26 weeks at 2lbs 2oz. She is now a vibrant 17 year old about to graduate 
High School herself. No one can say that she was less than a live baby. Two of my 
other grandchildren were born at 29 weeks and 30 weeks . they are now 15 and 10 
years of age . There is no denying LD 1619 is license to murder. The life of the babies
of Maine is in your hands. I implore you to vote ought not to pass.
