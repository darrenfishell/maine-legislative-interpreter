Margaret  Hall
Whiting
LD 1619
My name is Margaret Hall, I reside in Whiting, ME, and I strongly oppose LD 1619. I
urge you, please vote no. 
It is wrong to place the burden of this issue onto physicians who have sworn to do no 
harm. You must vote to protect the rights of the most vulnerable of our children. It is 
unfathomable that our great State of Maine would allow babies who, the very next 
day, should be swaddled, cuddled, rocked, kissed, and sung to, to instead be crushed 
and torn from limb to limb. Please think about the gruesomeness of what you would 
be allowing. 
This law is too extreme for Maine. It is not right for our people. 
Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees... that they may make the fatherless their 
prey!  - Isaiah 10:1-2
God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day. If a man does 
not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow; he has prepared
for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts. Behold, the wicked man 
conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. He makes a pit, 
digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made. His mischief returns upon his 
own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.  - Psalm 7:11-16
Because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on 
the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. - Romans 2:5
But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be 
saved by him from the wrath of God. - Romans 5:8-9
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is 
at hand." - Matthew 4:17
Repent simply means to change your mind. Please change your mind! Please vote no. 
Thank you for taking the time to listen to the voice of the God-fearing people of 
Maine. You are precious to us and we love you and pray for you.
