Kellie Fitzgerald
China
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee onJudiciary, my name is Kellie Fitzgerald and I am a resident of 
China. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619.
I personally know women who have had abortions, as I'm sure we all do, even if they 
haven't shared their story with you.  Each one carries emotional, mental and 
sometimes physical scars from this process.  Expanding abortion to ANY time and for
ANY reason during a woman's pregnancy is not good for women, and it's not good for
Maine.  We will become a location for women to travel to in order to hurt themselves 
and kill their babies.  
Please do not pass this bill. Have compassion for the voiceless.  This is not 
compassion for women, as is being claimed.  This can only damage and hurt our 
society.
