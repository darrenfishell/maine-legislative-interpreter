Maine citizens who cherish the life of the unborn need to know what is contained in LD 1619, 
"An Act to improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.” 
First, if passed, this Act will eliminate the current standard for when an abortion may be- 
performed. The current standard for an abortion is no later than the point of viability (up6 
months), or later, if to preserve the life or health of the mother. 
LD 1619 will change this to, “After viability (6 months) an abortion may be performed only 
when it is necessary in the professional judgement of a physician." 
Sadly, Governor Mills supports this Act which allows, for any reason, termination of a healthy, 
breathing baby up to nine months with the agreement of her licensed physician. 
I believe the majority of Mainers are against such a radical change. LD 1619 takes away even 
more freedom from the unborn child — which we all were one day. 
Secondly, the criminal penalties for an unlicensed person who performs an abortion have been 
eliminated. 
I quote the Summary of the Act: 
”Finally, this bill removes the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without beingi 
licensed as a physician, physician assistant or advanced practiced registered nurse and 
performing an abortion after viability of the fetus when it was not necessary for the 
preservation of the life of the health of the mother." 
This Act provides protection for an unqualified, illegal abortion provider -— for what was once 
called a “back-alley abortion. ” Amazingly enough, LD 1619 claims to Improve Reproductive 
Privacy Laws. 
l urge you as Committee members to vote against LD 1619 and its related bills. if passed, it will 
be a black eye for our state and a disgrace to all who hold dear the life of the unborn.
