Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable 
Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Grace Clark and l ama 
resident of Winslow. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
l believe there is no need for abortion. Women are strong. Women are capable. We do not 
need abortion to be successful. The abortion lobby wants us to believe that women need 
abortion to be in equal standing with men. They say it empowers women. But men and women 
do not need equal standing. Women are capable of doing things that men cannot do. No man 
has ever, or will ever become pregnant and give birth to a human child. Only women can do 
that. That is the true empowerment of women. 
The reality of abortion is that it kills an innocent human life. There is nothing empowering about 
doing what is wrong.
