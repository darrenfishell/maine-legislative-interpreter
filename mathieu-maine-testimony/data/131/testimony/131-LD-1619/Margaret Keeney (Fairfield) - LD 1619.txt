Testimony of Margaret Keeney, resident of Fairfield, Me. concerning LD 1619 
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Margaret Keeney and l am a resident of Fairfield. 
l am testifying today in opposition of LD #1619 and all acts of abortion. 
l am here today to speak to you of my experience 45 years ago. I've carried this with me 
and kept it hidden away all these years. Regret and shame have been my burden. 
l was 18 years old and pregnant. l was terrified at the thought of being pregnant out of 
wedlock and mortified at the thought of telling my parents. 
l chose to contract the taking of a life. And that's the definition of murder. 
1. murder 
contract killing - a murder carried out on agreement with a hired killer 
rnu.n:"iet, sztzzyirzgg, e;<e¢:t.zt%<,m- unlawful premeditated killing of a human being by a human 
being. 
How is the act of the taking of a life inside a body any different from the taking of a life 
outside of the body? 
Responsibility comes by learning from the example of others. As we all have all 
learned by example, we must lead by example. You now have the responsibility of 
leading this country into making the right choice. I am asking you to please prevent 
Maine from being a destination of the termination of life by legalizing murder. 
Please stand with me on this matter. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
