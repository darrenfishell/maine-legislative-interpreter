LD 1619 "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws" 
 
Good morning, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Committee of 
Judiciary. My name is Craig Caffrey of Bowdoinham, and I am submitting my testimony in opposition of 
LD 1619 “An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.” 
As a Veteran with over two decades of service, I know all too well how precious life is. Instead of 
pushing to end life up to the moment of birth, the state should remove administrative “red tape” and 
waiver legal fees for adoption. Let those who are willing to open their arms and hearts to adaption be 
able to do so. Give the expectant mother another choice. Give the child a choice, and a chance. 
Then again, the abortion industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry with large kickbacks to the 
Democratic Party, so life is meaningless, but the campaign donations are everything. 
 
Thank you for your time, 
Craig Caffrey 
Bowdoinham 
Chief Petty Officer USN (Ret.)
