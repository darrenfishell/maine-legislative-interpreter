Rachel Berenyi
 Corinth
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Rachel Berenyi and I am a resident of 
Corinth. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619.
I have two precious children, the youngest an 8-week-old baby girl.  I cannot imagine 
Maine allowing babies that could survive outside the womb to be killed.  Abortion at 
ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine.  We already allow abortion for 
medical reasons.
Please do NOT pass LD 1619.  This will not be good for Maine and it's citizens.
