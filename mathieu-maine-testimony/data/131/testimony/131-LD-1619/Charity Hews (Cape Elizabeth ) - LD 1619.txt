LD 1619
Dear respective members of the judiciary committee, 
I am submitting testimony today on LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s 
Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
I believe that a woman should have a choice with what she does with her body. What 
if she is harming another body? If LD 1619 is enacted, I believe that this will allow a 
significant amount of increased negligence, misinformation and misleading to our 
young, sexually active children! Why does it even seem moral or responsible to let a 
young woman choose to murder a perfectly healthy child that would cause no harm? 
Who believes it’s just fine to let their young, sexually active children not have to 
think of, or consider the immense consequences that this type of procedure will have 
not only on their physical health, but also their mental health. I can understand life 
threatening situations for mother and/or child. This is not that! This would allow a 
huge gateway of loopholes and deception. It is overwhelming and heart wrenching to 
think that Mills would encourage murder where it is truly not necessary. How about 
putting the efforts into education, condoms, more birth control? How about teaching 
children responsibly, maybe even abstinence? Are these so far off that we have to 
resort to murder?
