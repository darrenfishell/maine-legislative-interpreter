LD 1619
As a pro-life advocate, I firmly believe that abortion is morally wrong and should not 
be allowed. Every human life is precious and deserves protection, regardless of the 
circumstances surrounding its conception.
When a woman chooses to have an abortion, she is essentially taking the life of a 
developing human being. This act is not only unethical, but it goes against the basic 
principles of human rights and dignity. The right to life, is the most fundamental of all
other rights which are based off of. 
Furthermore, many arguments in support of abortion are based on faulty reasoning. 
For example, the argument that a woman has the right to do whatever she wants with 
her own body doesn't hold up when considering that the fetus is a separate and 
distinct entity with its own unique DNA. The fetus is not the woman's body, but 
rather a separate human life growing within her.
Additionally, proponents of abortion often argue that it is necessary for cases of rape, 
incest, or health complications. However, these cases make up a small minority of 
abortions, and are already covered under Maine law. In many instances, there are 
alternative solutions that don't involve taking the life of the unborn child.
In conclusion, I believe that LD1619 is morally reprehensible and should be struck 
down. We need to promote a culture that values and protects every human life, from 
conception to natural death. Most importantly, any representative that votes in favor 
of LD1619 will not only lose my vote, but I will actively oppose them in the next 
election.
Thank you for considering my opinion.
