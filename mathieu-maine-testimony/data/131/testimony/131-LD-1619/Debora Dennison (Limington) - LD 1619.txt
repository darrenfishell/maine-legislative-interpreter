Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Debora Dennison, and I am a resident of Limington. I am here to testify in 
opposition of LD 1619. 
The reason I am opposed to LD 1619 is because it is wrong for Maine. Being on the 
receiving side of an abortion, I can personally say that abortions destroy a woman’s 
self-worth. I struggled for years with quilt and shame. The truth is that I lost all respect 
for who I was as a human and didn’t care what happened to me. I was in and out of 
relationships for the wrong reason. I was broken on the inside and ready to end my life. 
This is not the kind of life I want for my daughter, granddaughter, or any young lady 
caught up in the lies of the abortion facilities only to find out too late that they regret 
their decision. 
Maine would have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country. Medical 
necessity is covered by current law. 
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
to see pass. Thank you. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
