   I am an 81 year old active voter and a Catholic who believes in Sanctiy of Life.  I 
am  opposed to LD 1619 and ask that it be voted NO.  I cannot believe you are all 
even considering these extreme measures against our precious babies!  Please say a 
prayer and vote down these 3 bills.  God bless you all.
