Good morning, 
I am contacting you in regards to LD1619 and the proposed thought that abortion could happen up until the 
moment a baby is born. 
Babies are humans from the time of conception and this is nothing short of murder. If we don't speak up for the 
unborn who Willâ€˜? 
I admonish you to reject this bill out of simple love and respect for our fellow humans who can not speak for 
themselves. Do you want the blood of these dear ones on your hands? 
Kelly Little
