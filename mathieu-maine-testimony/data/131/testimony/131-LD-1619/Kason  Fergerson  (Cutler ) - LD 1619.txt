LD 1619
I oppose LD 1619. I am 18 years old and newly married. I have a conscience like 
everyone else has but over these last few years people are losing their conscience. I so
strongly oppose this bill because every child deserves the right to live. And people say
it’s my body my choice, well it is your body and your choice but there is another body
inside your body that isn’t your choice. If you don’t want to have a child then take the
precautions to not get pregnant. Please oppose this bill!
