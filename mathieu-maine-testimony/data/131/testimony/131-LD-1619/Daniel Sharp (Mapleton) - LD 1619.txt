LD 1619
To the honorable members of the Maine Judiciary Committee,
In 1974, as a 16-year-old, I got my 16-year-old girlfriend pregnant. Her father was the
minister of a church in northern Maine. In many cases abortion would have seemed a 
good option, but my parents and her parents both not only believed abortion to be 
immoral when it involved others but also believed it immoral when it hit home.
For 2 years her parents would support their daughter and help tend our son while we 
both finished school. Upon graduation, we were married, as we were very much in 
love. We have been married for 47 years and raised our son along with 3 daughters. 
We have often thought about what could have happened if we did not have the 
support we had and had aborted our son, who has given us 5 beautiful grandchildren, 
3 biological and 2 adopted.
I am writing this in order to urge you to vote NO on LD 1619, which would allow for 
the murder of unborn babies up to the 9th month. I believe all abortion is immoral and
is infanticide. 
Instead of extending the legality of the murder of unborn children, I urge you to put 
programs into place that would support unwed teen mothers and others that become 
pregnant and do not feel they can support a child, via making adoption affordable, 
counseling for these women and whatever support is needed to save a human life.
