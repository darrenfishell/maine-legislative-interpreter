Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Membersof the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Stephen Ehle. I am a resident of Friendship, Maine. 
l am here to oppose LD 1619. The precious gift of life should be afforded to all. While we 
disagree on when that may begin, l believe we can agree that a life which can maintain itself 
with little to no medical intervention deserves our protection. There is no choice in the matter 
There is only life or death. 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you for your time.
