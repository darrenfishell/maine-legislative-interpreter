Jennifer Self
Rockport
LD 1619
Please vote NO.
Dear Gentlemen and Ladies of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Jennifer Self, I am a year round resident in Rockport, Maine. I am a wife 
and a mother of five kids!  I would like to remind you who you are! You are human, 
you are male and female created in the image of God. You are an image bearer of the 
very One who knit you together in your mothers womb! You are a miracle! You were 
fearfully and wonderfully made for such a time as this—designed with purpose for 
purpose! You are no accident! You are a miracle! The moment your life and purpose 
began was at the very miraculous moment of conception! As long as you have a 
heartbeat as long as you have breath in your lungs you have life and you have 
purpose!  As does every life at the moment of conception.  I’m asking you to know 
who you are and to please use your influence and authority to fight for life and 
purpose, not destroy it. I assure you standing before God none of us will want the 
blood of the future generations on our hands. I am for life. I am in opposition to LDs 
616, 935 and LDs 1343 and 1619. And I pray you will be too.
Again, please vote NO.
Thank you!
—Jennifer
