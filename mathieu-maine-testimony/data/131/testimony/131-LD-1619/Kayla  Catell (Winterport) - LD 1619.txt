LD 1619
Dear Committee,
I strongly oppose LD 1619 and believe there is no grounds to allow abortion after 
viability. As a Christian, I am Pro-Life, and believe that life begins at conception, and 
that the fact a child's heartbeat can be detected around 6 weeks of pregnancy and has 
entirely unique DNA, should be argument enough that it is in fact a valuable life. 
There is no moral ground to allow abortion after viability. Science and technology is 
innovative and has provided us with the ability to allow preterm delivered babies to 
survive and thrive outside of the womb, but yet with this bill, we are allowing women 
to terminate their pregnancy at stages when the child could survive independently of 
medical intervention.  
If quality of life is your argument, I encourage you to recognize that science is not 
error proof and approval of this bill is supporting eugenics. I have met several woman
who were encouraged by physicians to terminate their pregnancy due to results of 
prenatal testing. In these cases, the prenatal testing was inaccurate or because of the 
gift of science, the child was able to be healed after birth and are living a completely 
healthy childhood.
This bill is not supporting reproductive health, it is diminishing the value of life in our
state. Instead of supporting this bill, I urge the committee to create a bill that shows 
Maine values life and provides better assistance to pregnant and postpartum mothers 
or reform the adoption process to make it easier for family's in our state to provide a 
loving environment for these lives that we are so quick to terminate.
