Kristen Chapman
Sumner
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Kristen Chapman and I am a resident of Sumner. I urge you to vote 
OUGHT NOT TO PASS LD 1619. 
I implore you to truly represent the citizens of Maine who overwhelmingly showed up
to testify against this dangerous proposed legislation. You are elected to represent the 
people, and Maine's citizens are growing frustrated with their voices not being heard. 
I personally waited until nearly-6 am early Tuesday morning on May 2 to deliver my 
appeal to you, the Judiciary Committee. With time cut down IN THE MIDST of the 
public hearing from 3 minutes to merely ONE, on this extremely important issue, I 
could only speak to the importance of elected officials hearing the message of the 
reported 675 people testifying at the Capitol that day, as opposed to the reported 
dismal number of 67 who spoke in support of the bill. (My comments here are a 
summary of what I stated off-the-cuff during in-person testimony; it would have been 
impossible to speak to all of my concerns regarding this bill within the confines of 
one minute). Residents of Maine showed up to voice their vehement opposition to this
horrendous proposed bill; Maine's citizens are ATTEMPTING to participate in the 
legislative process as is provided. Please do not further frustrate the hundreds of 
Maine's voters who sacrificed so much to participate in the public hearing, to speak 
against this murderous piece of proposed-legislation. 
As I testified in person, the Bible states in 2 Corinthians 5:10 "For we must all stand 
before Christ to be judged. We will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or 
evil we have done in this earthly body." All legislators who cast a vote regarding LD 
1619 need to strongly heed these words.
I urge you all to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS LD 1619.
