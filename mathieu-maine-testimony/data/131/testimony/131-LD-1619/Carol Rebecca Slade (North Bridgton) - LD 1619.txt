LD 1619
Dear Chairman and other committee members,
I would like to express my view about the upcoming governor's bill LD 1619, "An 
Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws‚Äù. 
I do not want bill LD 1619 to pass.
 The mother has much less protection because there will be no criminal charges if the 
mother is harmed during an abortion. And, also, if abortions are done after the baby is
viable than he or she can feel pain and will experience the pain of it being aborted.
I recommend ought not to pass.
Thank you,
Carol Slade
