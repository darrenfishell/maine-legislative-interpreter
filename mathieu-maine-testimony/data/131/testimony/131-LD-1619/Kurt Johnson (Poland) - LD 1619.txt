An

Senator

and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary:
As
science
has
proven,
a
fertilized
egg,
all
the
way
through
birth,
is
a
unique
human
being.
Having
all
the
genetic
information
and
capacity
to
grow
and
develop.
This
process
continues
through
childhood
and
throughout
a
human
life
span.
Passing
this
law
comes
in
direct
conflict
with
existing
Maine
Law .

The
human
embryo
is
the
same
individual
as
the
human
organism
at
subsequent
stages
of
development.
The
evidence
for
this
is
the
genetic
and
epigenetic
composition 
of
this
being—that
is,
the
embryo's
molecular
composition
is
such
that
he
or
she
has
the 
internal
resources
to
develop
actively
himself
or
herself
to
the
next
mature
stage—and 
the
typical
embryo's
regular ,
predictable
and
observable
behavior—that
is,
the
embryo's 
actual
progression
through
an
internally
coordinated
and
complex
sequence
of 
development
to
his
or
her
mature
stage.
It
is
important
to
note
that
embryological 
evidence
shows
that
the
human
embryo
is
a
whole,
although
obviously
immature, 
human
being;
it
is
not
a
mere
part.
According
to
State
of
Maine
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services:

Below
is
a
list
of
behaviors
by
parents
and/or
caregivers
that
should
be
reported
to 
Intake,
keep
in
mind
this
is
not
an
exhaustive
list,
we
encourage
anyone
with 
concerns
to
make
a
report:
●
Physically
harming
a
child
(beyond
spanking
in
a
reasonable
manner) 
●
Sexually
abusing
a
child 
●
Exposing
a
child
to
substance
use,
domestic
violence,
or
other
unsafe
conditions 
●
Failing
to
provide
adequate
food,
shelter ,
clothing,
or
medical
care 
●
Exposing
a
child
to
unsafe
or
unsanitary
living
conditions 
●
Threatening
to
harm
a
child 
●
Chronically
calling
a
child
names
or
putting
them
down
Why
do
we
have
these
laws?
Because
our
culture,
as
does
almost
every
other
culture,
believes
that
ending
the
life
of
another
is
fundamentally
wrong.
This
law
was
initially
argued
that
in
certain
circumstances
where
the
mother ’ s
life
might 
be
in
jeopardy ,
that
a
choice
was
then
allowed.
It
still
ended
the
life
of
a
living
child.
Now 
it
is
just
left
to
a
doctor?
Who
takes
an
oath
to
preserve
human
life.
W e
are
either
person’ s
or
property .
If
a
person
is
considered
property
to
be
treated
as 
the
owner
of
the
property
chooses,
well
we
already
know
that
is
not
good
for
our
culture.
Please
vote
against
the
attack
on
the
most
innocent
and
defenseless
in
our
society .
