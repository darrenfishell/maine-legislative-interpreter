LD 1619
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 1619.   This would make us one of the most extreme states 
on abortion laws in our nation.  This is not what is best for women or the reborn who 
also have a right to live.  
Please vote OUGHT NOT to pass on LD 1619
Thank you, Elizabeth A. Homchuck (Guilford)
