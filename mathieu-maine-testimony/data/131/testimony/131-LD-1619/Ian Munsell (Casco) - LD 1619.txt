Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Ian Munsell, a resident of Casco, and a lifelong 
resident of Maine. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I am here because I wish to speak up for those who can't. My wife and I recently learned 
that she isexpecting. A few more weeksl-ater we learned we were having a baby girl- . We 
were overjoyed, but it wasn't until the first ultrasound that the news really sank in. At that 
moment I finally saw my daughter, she was- hiccuping and moving around. We could hear 
her fast heartbeat and see her grasping hands. It was clear that her heartbeat and body 
were distinct from- her mothers, and- she is-a separate human being that responds-to her 
s-urroundings- . 
As of today Abigail is 14 weeks old. She is the size of a navel orange. At this age she can 
make f-aces, her genitalsareformed- , she-is growing hair, and she is actively moving- 
around and flexing her fingers and toes. Abi's organs are working and she can finally hear 
her mother and I talk to her. Whenever my wife and I tell her “I love you Abi" , she can now 
be comforted and mayceven smilein response. 
By passing LD 1619 we will be allowing the dismantling of children twice the age of our 
Abigail. In this era we use abortion almost like a form of contraception, but we must realize 
we are destroying a life with every single abortion. I know it's easy to pretend a fetus is not 
human, but biology says otherwise. The DNA of every embryo iscunique, and is-duplicating 
cells, requiring life. Even the word "fetus" in Latin means "offspring" , “Fruit” , and 
“childbearing" . Therefore I implore the honorable members of the joint standing committee 
to take courage to protect those who can't protect themselves. Reject this overextending 
bill. -_ 
Thank you for your time-
