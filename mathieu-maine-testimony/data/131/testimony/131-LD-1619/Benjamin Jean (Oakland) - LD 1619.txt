LD1619 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Benjamin Jean, and I am a resident 
of Oakland. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
One of the reasons I am testifying today is because I myself was born6 
weeks prematurely due to complications. My growth in the womb was not to par 
with what was expected for being 34 weeks. I was born via C- section at 2Ibs and 
1502. Yet my testimony is that my inward parts were known and intentionally 
formed before my mother ever got a chance to hold me. My being in the womb, 
and even my condition did not and does not dictate my value. There was and is 
hope. My due date was on April 19th of 1996. I was born on March 1st, 6 plus 
weeks premature, it was the date of my grandmother's birthday that I ended up 
being born. Now fast forwarding 22 years later, my son was born on the date of 
April 19th, my original due date and This falls on my mother's birthday, which is of 
course my son's grandmother. This is just a tiny taste of how me and my family 
are living proof that before a child ever reaches the arms of their mother that 
child is already known intimately, has a future and a hope and is considered as 
valuable as any other person. 
As far as LD1619, I must say this, that medical necessity is already covered 
by current law. Putting a bill like this into law is setting the stage for other states 
to follow similar extreme measures. Meaning that my home State of Maine could 
be a pioneer in the death of countless destinies and treasured souls, just like 
mine. 
I am speaking up for the lives of those who do not have a voice to defend 
themselves to say that these children have a right to life. This law is not out of 
medical necessity but out of convenience and devalues the life of those I call 
fellow Mainers. 
Thank you for your time.
