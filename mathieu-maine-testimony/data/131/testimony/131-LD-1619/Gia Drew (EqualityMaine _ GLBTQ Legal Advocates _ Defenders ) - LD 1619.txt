Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee:
my
name
is
Gia
Drew ,
and
I
am
the
executive
director
of
EqualityMaine,
which
has
been
advocating
on
behalf
of
Maine’ s
LGBTQ+
community
since
1984.
W e
are
testifying
with
GLBTQ
Legal
Advocates
and
Defenders
(GLAD)
in
sup
port
of
LD
1619,
An
Act
to
Improve
Maine's
Reproductive
Privacy
Laws.
LGBTQ+
people
are
among
those
who
become
pregnant
and
need
access
to
safe
abortion
care.
Statistically ,
LGBTQ+
people
are
about
twice
as
likely
as
their
cisgender ,
heterosexual
peers
to
have
a
teen
pregnancy
1
,
significantly
more
likely
to
be
the
victims
of
sexual
violence
resulting
in
pregnancy
2
,
and
more
likely
to
have
an
abortion.

Furthermore,
the
right
to
a
safe
abortion
is
a
right
to
bodily
autonomy ,
which
is
an
integral
part
of
our
community’ s
fight
for
equality .
W e
believe
unequivocally
that
any
restrictions
on
people’ s
bodily
choices
can
deny
them
their
ability
to
live
with
authenticity
and
dignity ,
or
even
to
live
at
all.
Medical
care
providers
understand
that
people
in
their
care
are
individuals
with
unique
needs,
values,
and
circumstances.
Informed
consent
guides
professionals
legally
and
ethically ,
making
them
highly
qualified
advisors
for
the
choices
people
make
pertaining
to
their
health.
The
removal
of
legislative
restrictions
and
penalties
–
which
were
implemented
by
those
who
are
neither
familiar
with
the
practice
of
medicine
nor
with
the
individual
seeking
care
–
will
appropriately
transfer
medical
decisions
to
the
patient
and
provider
relationship.

The
more
that
access
to
legal
abortions
is
restricted,
the
higher
the
risks
for
those
seeking
abortion
services
becomes.

Lastly ,
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
bill’ s
language
be
updated
to
be
more
inclusive
by
using
“pregnant
person”
in
place
of
“mother"
and
“their”
in
place
of
“her”.
Thank
you
