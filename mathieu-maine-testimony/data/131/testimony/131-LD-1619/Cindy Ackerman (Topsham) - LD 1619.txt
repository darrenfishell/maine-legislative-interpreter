LD 1619
Good day-
I am writing in opposition of LD 1619.  This is the first time I have submitted written 
testimony to a legislative committee.  What is being brought forth in this bill led to 
me not standing on the sidelines.  What is being proposed in this bill for unborn 
children and those at full-term is barbaric.  The definition of barbaric is: savagely 
cruel; exceedingly brutal.  Being a former Latin teacher, I am well versed in Roman 
history and their barbaric practices.  It is hard to believe 2,000 years later our state's 
governor is asking the legislature to consider such an uncivilized bill.  What you are 
asking the citizens of Maine to condone is unconscionable.  
I end with a quote from St. Augustine of Rome that is my plea for you to consider 
when making your decision:  "Since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special 
attention to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstances, are 
brought into closer connection with you."
The unborn and those newly born have no voice or power, but I am speaking up for 
them and urge you to vote no on LD 1619.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my testimony.
Sincerely,
Cindy Ackerman
