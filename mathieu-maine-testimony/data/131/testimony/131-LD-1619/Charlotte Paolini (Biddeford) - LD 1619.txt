Charlotte Paolini
Biddeford
LD 1619
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Malon, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing on Judiciary:
My name is Dr. Charlotte Paolini. I am a physician trained in family medicine and 
geriatrics. I am a resident of the State of Maine and reside in the town of Biddeford.  I
represent the American Association of Medical Ethics and I am writing this testimony
in opposition to LD 1619.
The majority of my medical training and service have been done in Maine, which I 
consider my home. As a primary care physician for the citizens of this state, I 
consider it a privilege and my duty to serve patients with integrity. I take seriously the
oath that I took as a new physician to "do no harm".  For these reasons, I find LD1619
to be an egregious assault on the health of women and the unborn.  It undermines the 
care and evidence-based practices that we strive for in the care if our patients, which 
include the born and the unborn. I am appalled that the necessary ethical guidelines 
needed for the safe practice of health care are nowhere to be found in this bill, making
it dangerous and deadly. ALL healthcare professionals need parameters in which to 
operate in the best interest of their patients and the general public safety.  LD1619 
provides none of this.
Therefore, I urge you to vote, "ought not to pass", on LD1619. This bill, if passed, 
will represent a reckless and unnecessary decline in the healthcare practices enjoyed 
by the citizens of the State of Maine, heretofore.
Respectfully,
Charlotte A. Paolini, D.O.
