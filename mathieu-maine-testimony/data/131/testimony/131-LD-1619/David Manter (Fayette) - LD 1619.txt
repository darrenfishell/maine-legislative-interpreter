When a hen lay s an eg g, it doesn’t hatch into a g iraffe.  When an ostrich la ys an eg g, it doesn’t
hatch into a hippopotamus.  When a woma n gives birth, it is t o a human c hild.  I t was a huma n
child from the moment the e gg was fe rtiliz ed.
God told us that we ca n dispatch any thing we  need to ke ep us alive, e xcept that we  cannot
dispatch a huma n life.  Ter minating a  child’s life is not proper ly left to the judg ment of a
physician.  That is Murde r.
Any child that is conce ived has a  right to be kept as he althy  as possible up to the time of its birth,
and that mea ns the same f or the mother.  I t is our responsibility  to help a woman r emain hea lthy
and ca rry this baby  to term, not to make bac k alley  abortions more a vailable by  removing  the
penalties a gainst it.
Once  the child is born, there  are options we ca n offe r to the mother -  we ha ve the r esourc es to
offer adoption, or support se rvice s, as nee ded.  I f we have the  resour ces to take  in immi grants,
then ce rtainly  we ha ve the a bility  to car e for our own - both the c hild insi de, and the  mother.
