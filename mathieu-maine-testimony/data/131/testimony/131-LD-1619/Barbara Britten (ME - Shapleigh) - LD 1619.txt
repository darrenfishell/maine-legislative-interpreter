LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
  
My name is Barbara Britten, and I’m a resident of Shapleigh. I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619.
Please do not pass this bill.
I am so ashamed of the United States of America allowing abortions to take place.
I remember when it was unheard of. Life begins at conception, and ends with natural 
death.
Ultrasounds of babies in the womb show their hearts beating, their hands moving, 
their thumbs in their mouths.
They are tiny human beings.
These unborn humans are miracles of God – or if you prefer, a higher being.
It is not up to us to destroy these beautiful humans who have the potential to change 
the world for the better. doctors, nurses, teachers,clergy, politicians, moms, dads, et 
al.
Leave them alone.
Do not make it easy for women to abort their babies
.
Make it easy for them to choose life for their babies.
Show them ultrasounds. Let them hear the heartbeats.
Make it easy for babies to be adopted.
Stop all bills that allow abortions. 
Please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD 1619.
 
Thank you.
