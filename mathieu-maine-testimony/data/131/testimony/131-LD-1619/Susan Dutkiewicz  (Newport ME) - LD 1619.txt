Susan Dutkiewicz 
Newport ME
LD 1619
My name is Susan Dutkiewicz, I live in Newport Maine, and I am writing in 
opposition of the LD 1619 bill. 
I am blessed with a beautiful 24 year old daughter. A daughter that was born with 
special needs. A daughter that by some peoples standards, wouldn’t have been worth 
giving birth too. In fact I know a handful of people who have aborted their babies, for 
having the exact same condition as my daughter. And they are the ones that missed 
out. 
My daughter is my absolute best friend. She has changed me into a better person, in 
more ways than I could begin to explain. Her life is not only worth it. Her life, and her
story, is powerful. She impacts people for the good, everywhere she goes. And has 
made this world a better place. I am so thankful I chose life. 
We cannot let this bill pass. It is beyond evil. The abortion laws in our State, are 
already way too extreme. We need to fight for the lives of these unborn babies. They 
can’t fight for themselves, but their lives are certainly worth fighting for. We as a 
State, already have too much innocent blood on our hands. And the wrath of God is 
something to be greatly feared. 
Please, please, please do not pass LD 1619. We the people, do not stand for it.
