Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Carolyn Garland and I am a resident of Bangor. l became pregnant at 15 andI 
thank God abortion was still illegal, it was never an option. I can’t imagine life without my son. 
I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619, An Act to improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy 
Laws. In 1973 when abortion became legal, one of the biggest selling points was the need to 
enable doctors to legally perform abortions, because so many women were dying. Safety. 
Now it appears this bills intention is to relax or loosen the qualifications they once said were 
necessary, and enable people other than doctors to perform abortions. l’m confused. initially 
they said abortion was okay early because it wasn't a baby or even human yet, so they limited 
the abortion to until twenty-four weeks. Now this bill would allow a baby who COULD survive 
outside the womb to be killed, even up to the moment of birth. No longer limiting this to be 
done only when the mothers health or live is at stake. Any reason. l cannot imagine anything 
this horrific being purposed, much less passed. What have we become? They call abortion 
“terminating a pregnancy ” because no one wants to hear that a child is being killed. That is the 
reality. This bill speaks to privacy and secrecy for the mother. Why is extra privacy needed for 
this? Do we do this for any other procedures ’? 
l do not want my state to become one ot the most extreme abortion law states in the country. l 
don’t want it to be a place for people to come because they want to kill their child. Do you? 
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1619. It is wrong.
