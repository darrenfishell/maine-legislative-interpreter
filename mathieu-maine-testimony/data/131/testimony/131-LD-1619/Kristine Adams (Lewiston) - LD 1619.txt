LD 1619
Hi there, 
My name Kristine Adams, and I'd to share my thoughts/feelings about LD1619. I am 
very disappointment that our state would even think about allowing an abortion to 
occur until the birth of a child. This is a human life we are talking about, I can 
understand if the child's or mom's life is at risk, but just to have an abortion for 
various reasons, such as "I don't like the father", "I'm too young to be a mom", "the 
father doesn't deserve to be a dad", "no one will help me", amongst other reasons. 
There are other options available, such as adoption, there are many people in this state
who can't have their children who will gladly adopt a child, myself included, as I can't
have my own children. These are innocent lives of children who never asked to be 
created, why are they being punished for something a woman/man did. I really hope 
you people reconsider this bill and change it.
