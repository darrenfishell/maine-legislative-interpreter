LD 1619
Dear Judiciary Committee,
I would like to submit my testimony on Bill LD 1618 and ask you to stand with me
and vote “Ought Not to Pass”. 
A bill allowing Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason, is too extreme for Maine, 
this bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. Please, 
please think about the generational ramifications of such a barbaric practice. This 
human could be your grandchild, your niece or nephew, the next genius to deliver a 
cure for cancer, or Alzheimer’s, or Parkinson’s, taken, not because of an illness or 
accident, but for someone deciding, that this human does not deserve the right to live. 
This would position Maine, “Vacationland” to have one of the most extreme abortion 
laws in the entire country. Our beautiful state would become known as 
“Abortionland”. 
Please vote “Ought Not to Pass” LD 1619, there is no need for such an extreme law, 
the medical necessity is already sufficiently recovered by current law, which makes 
me wonder what the underlying intent of this bill is. What burdens will be released, 
economically, and financially? 
Sincerely,
Patricia Collins
Windham, ME
