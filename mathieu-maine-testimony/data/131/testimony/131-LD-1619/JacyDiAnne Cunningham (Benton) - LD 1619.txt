Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary: 
My name is JacyDiAnne Cunningham, and I am a resident of Benton. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
l am a single woman with the desire to someday become a mother. This bill is shocking to me because 
abortion carried out into late-term is killing a child. One that could survive outside of the womb. 
l believe abortion at any stage is murder. No matter how far along the child is, the cells are still human 
cells. 
Doctors do what they can to save a baby's life if needed when born prematurely or even during 
pregnancy. Steps can be taken to help the baby be okay while in the womb. Why then would it be okay 
with this bill to kill the baby for any reason? 
My father did not want another child after having two teenage daughters. My mother said no to an 
abortion. She wanted me and raised me as a single mother, despite the inconveniences and hardships 
that brought. 
I was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck. I had to be put into an incubator to make 
sure I was going to be okay. 
Late-term abortion is not giving children life when they are very able to sun/ive. Ourjob as adults is to 
protect children and help them grow into adults who have a purpose and right to be alive. They didnâ€™t 
choose to be conceived. Their parents made that choice. We need to make a stand for them because 
they have no voice yet, but they have a right to live. They could become the next leaders. They are here 
for a reason. 
My mother helped give me a voice so I could have the right to live. l want to do the same for all the 
unborn. l am a proud resident of the state of Maine. The majority of us do not agree with this bill. We 
don't want to be known for having one of _ the very few most extreme abortion laws in the country. 
Please vote ought not to pass!
