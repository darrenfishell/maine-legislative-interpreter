I attended church 4x a week. I read the Bible front to back at least 4x. I attended 
private Christian school and learned very little about my body or the reproductive 
system in my school. We were taught abstinence, yet I began having sex at 16. After a
few pregnancy scares I turned to my medical professionals for conversations about 
my reproductive health. They were a lifesaver! As an adult I pursued higher education
and became a healthcare worker. My worldview began to change when I needed 
abortion care. I suffered a miscarriage at 10 weeks and needed a D&C. I bet many of 
you will shake your heads and say “that’s different”, bluntly..no it’s not. The 
procedure is the same, regardless of intent. Without my abortion, I could have gone 
septic and died. I strongly support legislation that protects and expands access to safe 
and legal abortion services for all people. Unlike most of you in this room, I have 
received abortion care and actually assisted women in their own abortion care. 
Despite my conservative upbringing, my own personal experiences led me to support 
policies that remove barriers to care and funding for reproductive health services. 
Access to safe and legal abortion is a critical component of comprehensive 
reproductive healthcare, and every person has the right to make their own informed 
reproductive decisions without interference from politicians or anti-choice activists. 
This topic is a difficult one but ultimately it’s a conversation that should happen 
between a woman and her doctor, not with any of you! As a healthcare worker, I will 
continue to advocate for policies that promote reproductive justice and ensure that all 
individuals have access to the care they need and deserve.
