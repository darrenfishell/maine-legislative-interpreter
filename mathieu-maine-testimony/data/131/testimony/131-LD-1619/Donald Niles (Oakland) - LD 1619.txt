Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of joint standing committee On 
Judiciary. 
 
 My name is Donald N. Niles, I am a resident of Oakland Maine. 
I would like to submit a testimony in opposition to LD1619.  
 
My goal is not to seek to change or challenge existing law that allows abortion until viability; or in other 
words until the unborn baby can survive outside the womb. It can be scientifically proven that at the 
point of viability, which is around 22-23 weeks, the baby can feel sensation and extreme pain.  
One question I have is, how can a compassionate and civil society accept this as proper treatment 
towards a viable human being? A person who at 22-23 weeks, according to proven science,  has brain 
function, a heartbeat, emotions, and experience pain. So LD1619 moves us as a State Beyond civility to a 
barbaric and murderous society.  
It seems to me the mother’s health is a general concern but the theme I hear consistently drummed on 
is her right to choose.  My question on this matter is:  If at 22-23 weeks the Baby in the womb is a viable 
human being, who is defending their right to life?   
A convicted violent criminal is entitled to a right to trial, and may appeal the sentence.  How can our 
society, for any reason, condemn an innocent baby to die? Again, I ask you, who is defending their right 
to life? 
The current law protects choice due to rape, or incest given the length of time allowing for the 
Procedure to take place, as a matter of the mothers’ choice. This is sufficient and we do not need to 
extend current law. 
This bill is to extreme and without merit and should never pass.  
I want to thank you for taking the time to read and consider this testimony concerning LD1619. 
 I urge you to vote-OUGHT NOT TO PASS 
 
May your conscience be your guide. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Donald N. Niles, Oakland, Maine
