LD 1619
LD 1619 Testimony 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary.
My name is Randall Ward and I live in South China, Maine.  I am the grandfather of a
beautiful granddaughter who started life at 26 weeks gestation and weighed two 
pounds, four ounces.  She, along with professional help, survived and thrived and has 
grown to be a junior in college today.  Because the parents and medical professionals 
believed she could survive, abortion was certainly not an option.
This bill is unnecessary based on my Christian beliefs and values.  I believe that all 
lives are sacred.  
As an extremely concerned parent, grandparent, Christian, and Maine citizen, I am 
appalled this extreme legislation is being considered to be passedRa into law.  This 
bill is unnecessary and far too drastic for the state of Maine.  I am vehemently 
opposed to LD 1619 and implore you to vote “ought not to pass” on this bill.
