Crystal  Ouellette 
Topsham
LD 1619
My name is Crystal Ouellette, I am a resident of Topsham, Maine. I am writing to 
implore you to vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1619. Abortion at any time is too 
extreme for Maine. As Mainers let's protect the most innocent and vulnerable among 
us! Abortion is never the answer, not for cases of rape, not for convenience and not 
even in the cases of a mother's life, in such cases the baby can be delivered rather than
deliberately murdered. Please choose life! Please reject this bill!
Thank you for your consideration on this matter and for your service to our great 
state! 
Sincerely, 
Crystal Ouellette
