I am asking you to vote no on this bill not only does the current law in the state of 
Maine allow for the removal of a baby that has died in utero and for a baby that has a 
deadly diagnosis after the point of viability this bill also removes criminal penalties 
for unlicensed individuals. This bill would not in any way be beneficial to women and
would actually be dangerous for them. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
