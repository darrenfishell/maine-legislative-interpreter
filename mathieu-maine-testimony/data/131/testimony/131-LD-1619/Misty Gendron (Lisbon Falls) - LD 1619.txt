Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Misty Gendron and I am a resident of Lisbon Falls. I am 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
My son asked me to share his story. I had a challenging pregnancy and my son wasn't getting 
the nutrients and oxygen he needed to grow at the rate that the doctors would have liked. After 
some testing and observation, I was given a list of complications that he MIGHT face and I was 
offered the option to terminate the pregnancy. I declined and my son was born a micro-preemie 
at 30 weeks, but at the size and developmental stage of 24 weeks. He was under ONE pound 
for his ﬁrst weeks of life. While in the NICU, my son recognized the sound of my voice! His heart 
rate would increase and he would squirm until I picked him up. He also learned to recognize the 
voice of his nurse and would squeeze my finger as if begging me not to put him down. He would 
cry every time he had to have blood drawn for testing, and he would ﬂinch at the touch of cold 
fingers. He was fully human, capable of living, learning and feeling. He is 16 now and has had 
only a couple of struggles from the mile long list I was given from professionals who could only 
guess what his future might hold. When asked what he would say if he could speak up for 
babies without voices, he said this, “lt’s a no-brainer... I would rather be alive and have some 
struggles than be dead.” 
Abortion at ANY time is too extreme for Maine, but this bill that would allow for babies to be 
killed who COULD survive outside the womb, is simply immoral. Our current law ALREADY 
COVERS medical necessity and Maine does not need or want this extreme bill. Please oppose 
this bill. Thank you.- 
Misty Gendron
