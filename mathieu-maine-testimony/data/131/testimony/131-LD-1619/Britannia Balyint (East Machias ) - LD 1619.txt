This act may in some people’s opinions be making women’s reproductive privacy 
better, but what it is truly doing is making it legs to kill another human being out of 
convenience.  At no time ever should this be acceptable, we are heading down a very 
slippery slope to allow someone to choose death for another person before they are 
even able to speak for themselves. Abortion is never okay, but all the way up to 
delivery absolutely absurd! Even those born “special” have a place in this world, 
whether everyone feels that or not, those who do not have a lot to learn from those 
“special” people in this world and one of those very things is that we don’t kill people
who don’t fit in our puzzle. Please take the time to consider how awful a decision 
passing this act would be.
