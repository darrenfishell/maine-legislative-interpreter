LD 1619
I am Elizabeth Hays, I live in Portland and I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 
1619.
I have much life experience dealing with pregnant women deciding whether or not to 
have an abortion. I was a pregnancy options counselor with Maine Family Planning 
for 6 years, I have counseled and supported friends who chose to have an abortion and
I have had an abortion myself. I currently canvass for Planned Parenthood of 
Northern New England talking to women and men about their experiences and views 
on abortion. 
The resounding opinion I hear is that it is the women body and therefore her choice to
terminate a pregnancy, even later in pregnancy, with the advice of her doctor. From 
my experience I concur and feel it should remain a decision between a women and her
doctor when she should be able to get an abortion and not decided by Politicians. 
Abortions later in pregnancy are rare due to the fact that it is a decision made by a 
woman who planned to continue with her pregnancy but there is now a severe fetal 
defect that makes the pregnancy not sustainable and possibly a threat to the womanâ€™s  
health. It is a very difficult decision  and should not be made to be more complicated 
by legislation that states one week is OK to have an abortion and one week is not. 
Please vote, Ought to Pass on LD 1619.
Thank you 
Elizabeth Hays
