Faith Boucher
Newport ME
LD 1619
My name is Faith Boucher. I am 24 years old, and I live in Newport Maine. I am 
testifying in opposition of LD 1619. 
I believe abortion laws in our state are already far too extreme. And that the 24 week 
deadline alone, is horrible. So I certainly don’t want to seem as though I am 
consenting to that. However, making the appeal to push that as far out us anytime 
“until birth” absolutely blows my mind. I can’t believe we’ve come so far, that this is 
even an option. 
I know that a big argument for these late term abortions, is for the safety of the 
mother, and/or if the life of the baby is in jeopardy.   
I am here to argue against that. I was born with Cystic Fibrosis, which is a rare lung 
disease. When I was born, my mother was given a very discouraging life expectancy 
for me. If I were to be born in today’s day and age, some people might say, that my 
life wouldn’t be worth living. That I would never be able to grow up, get married, 
have kids or live a normal life. To that I say, shame on them. 
My life has not been easy. But it has been beautiful, and worth it. I have an amazing 
family, so many dear friends, and a fulfilling job. I am thankful to have been given the
chance. I am thankful my mother chose life. 
 
Who are we to decide who’s life is, or is not, worth living? When did we get that 
right? And where does that end? 
I am thankful that nobody decided for me, that my life would not be worth living. 
Because they certainly would have been very wrong. 
We need to stand together and fight against this bill. Far too many babies have 
already been unnecessarily killed, and it needs to end. 
Thank you for your time.
