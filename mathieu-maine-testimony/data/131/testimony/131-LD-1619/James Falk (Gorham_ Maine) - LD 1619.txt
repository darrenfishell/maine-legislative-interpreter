LD 1619
It is my hope the 131st Legislative for the great State of Maine voices a “no vote” 
against the passage of LD 1619. My purely personal reason that I am providing 
written testimony against LD 1619 is because I cherish maintaining life and a God 
gifted soul at all stages of human being existence from conception with unique DNA 
through fertilization to fetus development in the womb.
The State governments like Texas and Wisconsin are using the six weeks fetus 
heartbeat law.  Maine needs to use 21 days for their fetus heartbeat law to prohibit 
abortions.
Human life starts at conception. Unfortunately, most people desire some reliable 
measurement and visible proof of human life in order to state that it has legal 
significance.  Half of all Americans believe an unborn child in the womb should not 
be aborted once a heartbeat is detected.  Article found in the September 2, 2021 issue 
of USA TODAY states this fact:

In fact, the Holy Bible provides God’s view that the unborn child in the womb shows 
life the very minute blood is flowing through a heartbeat.  Leviticus 17:11 says: 
“Since the life of a living body is in its blood ….” (NAB version).
When can you hear the fetus heartbeat for the first time? The unborn child’s heart 
starts to beat as early as the 21 days of pregnancy. This is when the first sign of a 
developing embryo called a fetal pole is visible.
