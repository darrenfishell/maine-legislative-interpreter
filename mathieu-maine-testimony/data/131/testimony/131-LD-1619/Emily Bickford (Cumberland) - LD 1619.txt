Emily, Bickford, Speak Up For Life testimony against LD 1619 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Emily Bickford and I am a resident of the town of 
Cumberland. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Proverbs 31 :8-9 says, “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; defend the rights 
of the poor and needy.” Who is more poor and needy, more incapable of speaking up for 
themselves than these unborn children, created in the image of God, who in our country has 
been stripped of legal protection? 
l am opposed to LD 1619 because it would be legalizing an act of murder. This bill is too 
extreme for Maine. Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine. 
This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. lt brings me to 
tears to think of how that baby would be killed! l can’t imagine anybody would want that kind of 
blood on their hands! 
As a single mother, of a 10-year-old from a pregnancy that was unplanned, I can testify that 
there are resources and support for those who ﬁnd themselves pregnant, not knowing how to 
parent a child alone. l am also someone who has had an abortion at the age of 18, and it ﬁlled 
my life with deep regret, sorrow and mourning for the loss of my child. 
God's word says: 
“you shall not murder" Exodus 20:13 
“Before l formed you in the womb l knew you, before you were born I set you apart;" Jeremiah 
15 
“Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him.” Psalm 127:3 
Please vote against LD 1619.
