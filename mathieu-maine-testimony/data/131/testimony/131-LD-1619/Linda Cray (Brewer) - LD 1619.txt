LD 1619
To the Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee
My name is Linda Cray; I am a parent and grandparent who wishes to ask you to 
oppose LD1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. This is an 
extreme bill that reachs too far in the pursuit to ensure the right to chose. Please 
thoughtfully considered what this bill would allow. Taking the life of an innocent 
child right up until birth is, I believe, nothing short of murder. Please, don't we live in 
a civilized society?  Also consider the impact on the mother -time has shown that 
many women suffer from the impact of their actions. I believe it would be extremly 
traumatic to know you choose to not let your baby, a full term baby, live. Current law 
already allows for medical necessity in cases of stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy,etc.    
Families are the most important, precious items we hold. Young people are our future 
- please protect them. Please oppose this unnecessary, extreme bill. Thank you
