Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Jolene Martin of Bradley. I am testifying in opposition to ld 1619. When I was 19 
years old, I had a premature infant at 28 weeks weighing only 2 pounds, the shock and lack of 
bonding time, made me not see the treasure I was given. My son lived here for seven days 
outside me. I didnâ€™t appreciate the-time I was given because I was so focused on wrong things. 
After he died it ended up leaving an empty space that only God could fill and I wanted nothing 
more than to hold my baby and love him. Many women have abortions due to fear, 
hopelessness, and other related trials. But when given the chance and encouragement, many of 
these women would choose life and actually regret the decision they made, if they had a little 
hope. I am asking you to please give these women and babies another chance for life and hope. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
