 
 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary,  my name is Theresa Griffin and I am a resident of Hodgdon.  I am testifying in opposition to LD 
1619. 
 
It no longer matters if one is pro-life or pro-choice on the abortion issue.  LD 1619 would make it legal to 
terminate a pregnancy for any reason up to the time of birth.  This is clearly wrong.  Such an act can be 
called abortion, but in reality, after viability of the fetus, it is murder.   
 
Please vote in opposition to LD 1619, LD 776, LD1343
