﻿
 My name is Kelsey Stevens. I am from Machias, Maine. At 22  years old, and within 5﻿
weeks of being released from prison, I found out I was pregnant. I chose to 
terminate my pregnancy by abortion. Due to mild complications, I was dealing with 
medical issues months later. 8 months later, in September 2020, I found out I was 
pregnant again. Despite previous complications and emotional distress I chose to 
terminate the pregnancy again. In 2017 I was responsible for an incident that 
resulted in the death of someone who I was very close with. This incident happened 
due to my own choices and negligent behavior. What I began to realize after 
terminating these two babies was that I experienced the same grief, anxiety, regret, 
and shame after the abortions just as I had when dealing with the loss of my friend. 
This is significant because just as I grieved and felt shame over my 21 year old friend,
I also grieved and felt shame over these unborn children. Of course these situations 
are different, with different emotional responses, but the root of both situations is 
that lives were lost. In both situations I acted on selfish feelings resulting in the loss 
of life. These are aspects of an abortion that a women does not foresee. I convinced 
myself it was not possible to follow through with either pregnancy. I was looking for 
freedom in abortion, but I only found bondage to shame, guilt, regret, and fear. This 
bill, although seemingly to help women, will open the door for more emotional 
distress for women, and the loss of more lives. This bill leaves room for medical 
malpractice. This bill directly violates the protection that we as people should have 
for the precious life of a any human, born or unborn, at any stage of pregnancy. Our 
future should be determined by God only, not by government or any man. I do not 
approve of this bill. Please take these statements into consideration.
