LD 1619
Judiciary Committee,
Maine is a common sense state. LD 1619 is NOT common sense! Children in the 
womb have  heart beat at 6 weeks, feel pain at 12 weeks and are viable at 22 weeks, 
as a baby born at 22 weeks in Maine went home recently.  Abortion up to birth for 
any reason is cruel and wrong.  A baby's head is partially delivered and then the brain 
stem or skull are cut with scissors and the dead child is delivered.  If a woman finds 
an anomaly at 8 months, the child can be delivered and loved and held by his/her 
mother until they peacefully die---not torn apart alive in the womb!
Vote 1619 ought NOT TO PASS!
