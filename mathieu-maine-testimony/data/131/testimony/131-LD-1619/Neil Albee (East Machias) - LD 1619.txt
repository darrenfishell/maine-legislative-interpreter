LD 1619
This note is to the Senators and Representatives of Maine about LD1619. Honestly I 
believe to pass this one would be doing the devils work. I just ask you to take a few 
moments before you vote to consider what it would be like to listen to the heartbeat of
the child before it was aborted. It is a fact that most mothers who listen to the 
heartbeat of the child before abortion change there mind and keep the child. Also I 
can only wish you had a chance to listen to a testimony of a person who survived a 
abortion attempt so you could be reminded how precious life is. I pray your 
conscience is with you. Thanks so much for reading!
