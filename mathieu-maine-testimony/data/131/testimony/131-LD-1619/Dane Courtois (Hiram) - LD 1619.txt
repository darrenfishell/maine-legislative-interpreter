LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Dane Courtois of Hiram. I am writing in opposition of LD1619.
I am writing to you as a former pro-choice advocate. I have changed my opinions on 
this subject after deep contemplation, in recent years, of the non-aggression principle 
popularized by many libertarian thinkers, which states that no person shall hurt 
another or take their private property. This in my opinion is an absolute rule for life. 
This proposed furtherance of Maine's abortion laws would further make the 
murdering of unborn children legally acceptable in the state. Current law in the state 
already addresses viability and medical necessity in cases of stillbirth and ectopic 
pregnancy. 2/3rds of Mainer's do not agree with late term abortions. While I do not 
agree that abortions should ever be allowed by the state (with exception of the 
motherâ€™s life being in danger) we cannot allow Maine to be included in this radical 
psychotic idea that killing people is okay as long as they are inside a woman's womb. 
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
to see pass. Thank you!
Respectfully.
Dane Courtois
