Westbrook
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Judith Murray.  I live in Westbrook.  I am opposed to the proposed bill 
LD1619.  I was born prematurely at 7 months gestation.  I am also an adoptive parent 
of two wonderful children who were considered special needs when they were born.
I was born two months early, weighing a little more than four pounds.  I was no less a 
human being then than I am now. This bill will allow children the same age as I was, 
only still living inside their mother's wombs, to be killed by abortion for almost any 
reason.
In addition, as I mentioned earlier, I have two children adopted as infants. The birth 
mother of our son only decided when she was nine months pregnant, that she would 
place her son for adoption. If her state had a law that permitted late term abortion, our 
amazing now 30 year old son, who last year finished his Master's Degree in Medical 
IT in spite of serious learning disabilities, might not be alive today contributing 
positively to society.
According to statistics, approximately two thirds of Maine residents are opposed to 
late term abortions. They would be as horrified as I am at this proposition to legalize 
the killing of unique human beings whose lives are just as valuable as yours or mine. 
This is not a political issue. It is truly a human rights issue. I respectfully urge you to 
oppose this extreme bill just as the majority of your Maine constituents would. 
Thank you,
Judith Murray
