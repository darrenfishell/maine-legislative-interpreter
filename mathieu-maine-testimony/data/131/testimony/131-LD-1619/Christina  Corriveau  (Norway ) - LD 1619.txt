LD 1619
My name is Christina Corriveau and I am a resident of Norway. I am writing to testify
in opposition to LD1619. Abortion at anytime, for any reason is too extreme for 
Maine. This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. 
When I hear about a woman having an abortion, I think of a former co-worker of 
mine sitting across from me weeping with overwhelming regret as she told me her 
story about having an abortion many years ago. She was haunted by her decision that 
she made as she felt pressured by her boyfriend. She never forgave him or herself. As 
I was listening to her my heart ached for her situation and also for mine. I always 
wanted a baby and at the time had no children. I thought that I would never have 
children because I was getting too old. Then I met my now husband and I became 
pregnant. I was beyond excited. My dream of becoming a mother was coming a 
reality! Unfortunately,I had a miscarriage. Now I'm 47 years old and I'm happy to say 
that I am blessed with the most amazing son. I thank God for him everyday. I can't 
help but think about the woman who have regrets,like my former co-worker. The 
woman who can't have children and the one's who have had miscarriages. I think of 
those babies that could have gone to a loving home if only they were giving the 
chance at life. Thank you for your time. Please do not let this bill pass. Life is a 
beautiful gift.
