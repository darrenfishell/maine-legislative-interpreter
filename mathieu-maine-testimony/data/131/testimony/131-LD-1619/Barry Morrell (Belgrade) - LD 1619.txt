Statement by 
Barry Morrell 
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Regarding 
 
LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws, 
LD 776, Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish the 
Right to Bodily Autonomy, and  
LD 1343, An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of Maine People by Preempting the Field 
of Abortion Regulation. 
May 1, 2023 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to present before you. I am Barry Morrell, taxpayer and citizen of Belgrade, Maine. 
I am opposed to all three abortion bills before you today but am speaking only on LD 1619 because I 
believe the existing law on abortion is more than adequate for a woman’s needs.   
The governor wants to expand abortion law in Maine to allow abortion all nine months of pregnancy for 
any reason.  I am against that.   
Please vote “ought not to pass” on L.D. 1619, as well as the other two, L.D. 776 and L.D. 1343.
