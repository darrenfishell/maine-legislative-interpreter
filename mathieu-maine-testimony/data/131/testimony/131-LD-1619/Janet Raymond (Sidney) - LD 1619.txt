Standing Committee on Judiciary:    
 
My name is Janet Raymond, and I’m a resident of Sydney, Maine. I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619.  
 
Here we are once again at a place in time where we must face the consequences of our 
actions!   We are witnesses to the denial of the humanity of the youngest and most 
vulnerable in our society: the unborn.   We who believe in the sanctity of human life must 
rise up and speak.  
 
Our cou ntry has a long history of trying to justify abortion even calling it a part of 
reproductive health.   The evidence is that these little babies are being found in landfills, 
sewerage and water treatment plants, and dumpsters. This information needs to stir 
sympathy in us all.   We as a nation should be better than this!   With modern technology 
and medical support, there is no excuse now not to recognize that these unborn human 
beings have faces, hands, feet, beating hearts, and can survive outside of the 
womb .  This has become infanticide.  
 
In a country where eagle eggs are given more protection than our own human offspring, 
we must step out of the darkness into the light.   We must protect human life and stop 
the morally disgraceful slaughter of innocent babie s. 
 
Why the push to include viable human beings in the horrific process of abortion?  
 
Who will perform these barbaric procedures?   
 
What methods will be used in this process?  
 
When will we stand up and choose life and stop this culture of death?  
 
Please vo te ought not to pass.
