LD 1619
What kind of society can we be that we take/sacrifice the lives of our own children?
Some even call abortion a sacred act!  Really?
80 % of registered voters in our country would like there to be restrictions on 
abortion, yet LD 1619 allows for abortion up to the moment of birth. A most 
gruesome murder of an innocent.
There is so much assistance, help of every kind for the mother, the father, and the 
child. 
In choosing life, we help lift our society out of the darkness that has fallen upon us, 
especially since 1973.
Please vote against this barbaric legislation.
Thank you.
