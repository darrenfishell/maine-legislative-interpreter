Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Sheri Larsen and I am a resident of Winslow. I am offering 
my testimony in opposition to LD 1619 - An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy 
Laws. 
Pro-life and Pro-choice advocates disagree on much, but there is common ground: both sides 
want to ensure the chance for life; one for the mother and child, one for the mother. But LD 1619 
takes reproductive rights too far in exterminating the healthy, viable life of a child. 
Whatever your personal view on abortion, no one can argue that a life capable of living outside 
the womb yet discarded like garbage is a tragedy of the extreme and not right for Maine. This 
bill IS extreme. We need to work to help women in these cases find life-saving viable solutions 
and care. I urge you to oppose this drastic bill and support most Mainers who do not want this 
bill to pass. 
Thank you for your time and efforts. 
 
Sheri Larsen
