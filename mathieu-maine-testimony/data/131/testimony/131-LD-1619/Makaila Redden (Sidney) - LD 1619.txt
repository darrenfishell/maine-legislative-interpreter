I implore you as a woman, as a daughter, as a mother, to please object this horrendous
bill from moving forward. This would be a giant step backwards for our incredible 
state. We must provide care for those who are weak, for those who are disadvantaged,
and for those who are innocent and powerless. Science proves that preborn babies are 
human from the moment of fertilization, and they deserve our complete protection! 
Please stand against the murder of innocent children and make Maine a safe haven for
those who cannot defend themselves. 
My mother was told by Physicians to abort me when routine pregnancy tests 
determined I would have Down syndrome. 28 years later, those tests were proven 
wrong and I am a fully functioning member of society with three beautiful babies of 
my own. Thank you for your time and I trust that you will do what is best for Maine 
children.
