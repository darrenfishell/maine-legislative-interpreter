LD 1619
Honorable Chair and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is David Fedrizzi and I am from East Waterboro ME.
I am testifying today in opposition of LD1619 An act to improve Maine Reproductive
Privacy laws.
Rather than improve Maine reproductive privacy laws as the name of the bill states, 
LD 1619 seeks to expand the killing of innocent human lives beyond the so called 
point of viability to the point of birth for any reason. With no definition of what 
constitutes necessity , no medical requirement, no ethics test, this bill is extreme and 
allows for the taking of human life to the point of birth for convenience.
Medical professionals are human and no amount of education gives them the right to 
be arbiters of life and death. Further more this bill removes any serious penalty for 
unlicensed individuals who perform abortions or licensed individuals who take the 
life of a baby after birth after an abortion attempt.
This bill appears to be more about the Government of the State of Maine  supporting 
the abortion industry than it is about supporting the rights and lives of all Mainers. 
The rights and lives of all Mainers that the Government is sworn to protect.
Please note no on LD1619. This is not what the majority of Mainers want.
