LD 1619 Do not vote to pass this bill.  Governor Mills promised not to change the 
current abortion law.  She could not wait to do the exact opposite only days after her 
inauguration.  What does that tell me about her character. It tells me she is a liar and 
ought not to be trusted.  She did not have the courage and fortitude to say she would 
do this before the 2022 vote for Governor.
