I am Rev. Marraine Kettell. I live in the town of Farmington. I am ordained in the United Church 
of Christ. I urge you to pass LD 1619 
 
As a woman and as a member of the clergy, I firmly believe that each person has their divinely 
gifted bodily autonomy. Each one of us is empowered with our own moral agency to make 
decisions regarding our health and safety. LD 1619 advances Maine’s access to abortion and the 
protection of each patient to honor that bodily autonomy. Such a bill will decrease harm to 
women who have been forced to carry late-stage pregnancies to term. It honors individual 
agency to make the best decision possible. I often say to my congregants that our body is 
sacramental meaning that it is holy because of our relationship with God. Our responsibility in 
turn is to care for our holy vessel in the safest and healthiest way possible in conjunction with 
our health providers. As people of faith, we are called to live out God’s grace through justice, 
compassion, and hope. Passing LD 1619 supports our care for creation in honoring our bodies’ 
health and safety. 
 
These decisions need to be solely in the hands of the patient and the health care provider. Period. 
To honor that relationship between patient and provider, we must prohibit invasive data 
collection so that the person and their choice remains sacred. LD 1619 holds firm the personal 
nature of each decision by maintaining the confidentiality of identifying data that could make 
patients even more vulnerable in the midst of such a difficult choice. As Christians the Greatest 
Commandment calls for us to love our neighbors as ourselves. May we indeed love and trust one 
another and we would want to be trusted.  
 
Please vote to pass LD 1619
