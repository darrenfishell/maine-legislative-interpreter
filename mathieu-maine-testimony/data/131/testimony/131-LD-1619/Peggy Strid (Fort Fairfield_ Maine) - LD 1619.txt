LD 1619
I am not in agreement with passing bill LD 1619. This is agreeing to murder. That 
baby has a heartbeat, it's alive! If someone can be arrested for manslaughter because 
she gave birth to a baby and left it in a gravel pit to freeze to death, than how is it any 
different deliver a baby and leave it in a bin to die or as it's being born, put a scalpel 
or scissors into its neck because the mother didn't want it. This county is becoming 
barbaric.  Think about your children or grandchildren. What if someone wanted to 
take their life. Wouldn't you do everything in your power to protect them?Please, do 
not allow this to happen in our state.
