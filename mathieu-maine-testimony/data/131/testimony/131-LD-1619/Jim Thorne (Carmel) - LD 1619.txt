Testimony in Opposition to LD 1619 
“An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws” 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Representative Jim Throne and I represent the towns of Carmel and Hermon 
in beautiful Penobscot County. I am here today to testify in strong opposition to LD 
1619, “An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.” 
 
This bill is an atrocity. It holds no value to the sanctity of life.  No further words are 
needed. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
 
Respectfully,  
 
Jim Thorne  
State Representative
