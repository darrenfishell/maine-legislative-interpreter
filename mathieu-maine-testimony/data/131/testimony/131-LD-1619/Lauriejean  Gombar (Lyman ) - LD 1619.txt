Lyman 
LD 1619
Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonen and esteemed members of the 
committee, I respectfully ask you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1619.  The content 
of this bill as it is propels any safeguards for the idea of abortion being safe, out of the
water. The innocent  baby will always choose life. These babies are not the mother, 
though once pregnant, females are mothers. These babies deserve to be born without 
the pain of tools ripping them apart.  Please see Live Action’s Baby Olivia for seeing 
how beautifully a human develops in the womb.  Let’s not turn I95 into a river of 
blood where mothers come from all over to kill their children.  Vote ought not to pass 
on LD1619.
