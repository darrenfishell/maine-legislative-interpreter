Opposition to LD 1619 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable members of the joint standing 
committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Christopher Belyea and I am a resident of the City of Caribou in Aroostook County. I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I am an adoptive and foster parent of 3 young children and the father of 2 adult children. My 
story here today is that of adoption. Adoption changes lives through LIFE, abortion on the 
other hand changes lives through DEATH. The State of Maine as you know has provision for 
abortion on its books already and this new amendment takes it too far. There is no need or 
benefit to having this amendment when Adoption is so easily and readily available. Adoption 
changed my life when l was adopted at one year of age and then again when I adopted my 
three children. 
Thank you for your service here to the State of Maine and l urge you to Oppose this Bill LD 1619 
for the people of the State. 
Since rely, 
Christopher J. Belyea
