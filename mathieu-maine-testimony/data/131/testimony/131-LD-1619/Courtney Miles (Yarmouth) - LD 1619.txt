Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Courtney Miles and I am a resident of 
Yarmouth. I am testifying in opposition to LD 1619.
Do you believe in God?
If you believe in God you know that he is the only one who can give and take away 
life.
If you believe that the Bible is God’s word you will know that God created us in our 
mother’s womb (Psalm 139:13) and numbered the hairs on our heads (Luke 12:7). 
That’s how important every life is to God that he knows the number of hairs on your 
head. He knows your heart. He does not make mistakes. Humans make mistakes.
When God creates a life in the mother’s womb, who are we to override God and kill 
that life that can survive outside of the mother? God has plans and a purpose for that 
life that we are killing (Jeremiah 29:11). 
The bible says that our body is actually a temple to God. We are not our own but 
bought with a hefty price and are called to glorify God through our bodies (1 
Corinthians 6:19-20).
The only thing God has asked of us is to love Him (John 14:15) and love one another 
(Romans 13:8). Is abortion loving God and one another?
One day we will all be judged and one day we will have to stand face to face to all the
babies we chose to not love.
When we know better and do better there is forgiveness in Christ (Hebrews 9:22).
