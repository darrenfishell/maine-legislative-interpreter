I oppose the passing of this bill based on its promotion of the killing of a human life. 
Choosing to allow abortions is an act of child abuse and murder. In our state, it has 
been decided that the death penalty for adults is done away with even in the most 
heinous crimes. But yet, today you are choosing to allow the most innocent of all of 
us to be executed for the convenience of the mother and father who chose not to act 
responsibly. For you to vote in favor of this bill, it should require you to have to sit in 
a room for an hour and hold the tray of the remains that are removed for each abortion
that is done. I hope you have a moment of grace, think about what you are casting 
your vote for and picture your child or grandchild laying on a tray in front of you. 
Vote No.
