Tiffany Furbush
Machias
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Tiffany Furbush and I live in Machias, Maine. I am writing in opposition 
of LD-1619. This bill is an extreme measure as it would allow for babies who could 
survive outside the womb to be killed. This is an unthinkable action to take on a child 
who has been given life by God. I have had the amazing blessing of birthing one child
and would be so grateful to have more children, but we are unable to have more 
children so far.  Learning of the details of this proposed bill is shocking to me, 
realizing that a child one person desperately prays for could be carelessly discarded 
by the one entrusted to her to nurture and protect. Abortion at any time for any reason 
is extreme and places the responsibility for a life in the hands of a fallible human 
being. I join with many other Maine citizens in urging you to oppose this absolutely 
unnecessary and violent bill. Thank you.
