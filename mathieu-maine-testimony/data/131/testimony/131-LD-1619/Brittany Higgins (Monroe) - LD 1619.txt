Brittany Higgins
Monroe
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on
Judiciary, my name is Brittany Higgins and I am a resident of  Monroe. I am here to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619.‚Äù  This would allow a baby that could have survived 
outside of the womb to be killed.  This is murder and should be punishable by law. 
Make adoption more affordable and there might be less women considering abortion. 
Please vote NO
Thank you
