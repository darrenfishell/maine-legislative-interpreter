My name is Svetlana  Hall and I am from Wales,me 
Ever since governor Mills put forward this legislation, I have asked everyone I know :
what was their position? 
Mind you I had to explain to most of them what the current law is and how the new 
legislation would change it. 
The Majority of people I talked to would identify themselves as pro-choice.  In their 
words “women should have a choice “ 
Do you want to know what they thought?!
What the most interesting thing I found out was? 
They were shocked to know that the current law allows abortions up to 20-24 weeks, 
most of them thought 12 was plenty. 
I’m telling you right now, Maine does not want a full term abortion law. , even those 
who consider themselves pro-choice reject  this legislation. 
Do not be fooled by the small minority into thinking you have the support of your 
voters. 
You don’t. 
Maine is against aborting full term , viable babies. 
I think after listening to over 675 testimonies of Mainers SPEAKING UP for LIFE 
today you understand this too. 
So please,  do your job, represent Maine and vote against passing this bill.
