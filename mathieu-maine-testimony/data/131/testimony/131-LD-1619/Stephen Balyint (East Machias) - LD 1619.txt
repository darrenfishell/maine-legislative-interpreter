LD 1619
I oppose any bodily reproductive laws that allow for an abortion beyond an emergent 
medical necessity. Furthermore, I do not support any reproductive laws that do not 
give equal choice to both reproductive parties (mother and father). In the best interest 
of Maine families, our children, and the Country LD 1619 can not and should not be 
entertained. LD 1619 needs to be rejected in all parts.
