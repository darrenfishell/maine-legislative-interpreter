LD 1619
I am Sheila F Ricker a resident of Perry, ME I have lived in this great state my entire 
life. I strongly urge you to not support in any way LD1619. The very fact that I am 
able to submit testimony is because my parents chose life. I have adopted twins who 
were born at 27 weeks. To see them at 27 weeks with 1.5 lbs and 2.0 lbs with all they 
needed to live. lungs to breathe, a heart to beat, a little hand to grasp mine. The came 
into our home and into our hearts forever. These two are daughters, granddaughters, 
nieces, sisters and great contributors to this great state of Maine. They wake up 
everyday full of life, ready to play, go to the beach, and sing out loud when their 
favorite song comes on the radio. I ask you to defeat this bill as I would not want to 
be a part of any of the horrible ramifications that this will bring on the most innocent, 
most vulnerable in our State. Please I ask and pray that all of you in all good 
conscience do not as our elected representatives of Maine pass this bill.
