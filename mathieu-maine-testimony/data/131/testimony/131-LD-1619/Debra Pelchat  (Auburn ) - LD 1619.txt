LD 1619
I am writing in opposition to the bill LD 1619. This bill is the epitome of evil and 
must be defeated!
This new life developing inside it’s mother’s womb did not ask to be conceived and 
does not deserve a death sentence! Please do not make the state of Maine one of the 
most extreme pro abortion states in the country!
