Kara Gillen
Sidney
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Kara A. Gillen and I live in Sidney.  I am a parent of 3 elementary-aged 
children currently alive and well, and 3 children that were born not breathing before 
the age of 20 weeks gestation.  I held each one of their little hands, and held them 
close, wishing I could see them grow up.  I wonder frequently what our world would 
be like with them alive in it.  
I wonder also about all the future lives that would be at risk if this LD1619 passes.  
Most Mainers (2 out of 3) do not agree with late-term abortion.  It is very drastic.  Our
own governor said she didn't think the current laws needed to be changed.  The health
and the safety of the mother is already covered under current law.  
This law could endanger mothers seeking abortion procedures, because it does not 
afford them the protection they are currently provided under the law.  Currently, 
criminal charges are placed on a person if anyone other than a very specifically 
trained person is performing the procedure.
Please hear the voice of the majority of Mainers.  We do not want this bill to be 
passed.  Please protect the future generations of unborn Maine children.
Thank you.
