Subject: TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO LD 1619 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Joe Pickering Jr., and I’m a resident of Bangor. Thank you for allowing 
me to testify against LD 1619.
 
My personal reason for opposing it is the same reason why everyone in this room and 
Maine should be opposing it. WE ARE ALL ALIVE. We are LIVING the opportunity
to live. Allowing abortion anytime for any reason up until birth makes LD 1619 a 
mockery of life. When she ran for office, Governor Mills did not propose changing 
Maine's current Abortion Law. Governor Mills should honor Mainers with honesty by
keeping her word/tweet below and keep Maine abortion law as it now stands.

So long as I am Governor, my veto pen will stand in the way of any effort to 
undermine, rollback, or outright eliminate the right to safe and legal abortion in Maine

UNFORTUNATELY, SHE TOOK HER PEN AND HELPED REWRITE A NEW 
EXPANSIVE ABORTION BILL WHICH SUPPORTS MORE KILLING OF 
UNBORN BABIES.
 
Meanwhile, 80 % of all Americans think Abortion should be illegal in the Third 
Trimester. Read on.
