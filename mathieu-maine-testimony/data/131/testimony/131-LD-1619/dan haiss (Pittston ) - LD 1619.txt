April 16th was Holocaust Remembrance Day. As I listened to a seminar recounting 
the atrocities delivered by a Socialist Government during that time period and heard 
the vows of numerous others in attendance claiming they would do everything within 
their power to never allow history to repeat itself, it was ironic considering this battle 
we now face. The same company that produced the chemical agent that was used in 
the gas chambers for the Holocaust is still thriving today in the plan B pill.. Politics 
plays clever “wordsmithing” to avoid the reality of what is going on. By changing the 
term unborn baby to its Latin origin, most are woefully ignorant to connect the dots. 
Destruction of eagle eggs can land you serious federal and state penalties but here 
today we look to remove class c criminal charges against those who end the life of 
another human being. A single celled organism on mars would be considered life. 
National Geographic beautifully explores the wombs of countless species describing 
the growth of “babies” through video and scientific language, why then do we 
abandon science and our own kind? For convenience and love of money. We cannot 
keep the young in our State already, so let’s terminate the next generation like China 
has done and repeat the same cycle in society.. There is zero logic to this bloodthirsty,
money laundering scheme, and I do hope that the criminals will be exposed for the 
evil that they are. History will not be on the side of the spineless. May we be judged 
divinely for these evils we wish to portray as “reproductive rights”.
