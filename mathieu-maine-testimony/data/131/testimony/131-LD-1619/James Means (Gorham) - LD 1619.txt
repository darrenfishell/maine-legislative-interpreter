I respectfully ask each member to vote “ought not to pass” this proposed law which 
essentially allows the murder of a viable baby up to the moment of natural birth. The 
proposal also significantly reduces the qualifications of abortionists which places 
women’s health at greater risks.
Maine must not become known as the most liberal abortion State in the Country.
Thank you.
