To the Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Kristen Kuschke and I oppose LD 1619. For the love of God, people! LD 
1619 is nothing short of murder. Your constituents do not want this abortion 
expansion. It isn’t necessary. Emergency provisions for the health of the mother are 
already in place. Look, I’m a nurse here in Maine and can tell you science has come 
too far. Already we are without excuse. Thou shalt not kill. This is murder. Nothing 
less. Their blood will be on your hands. 
Praying that you choose wisely. 
Kristen Kuschke
