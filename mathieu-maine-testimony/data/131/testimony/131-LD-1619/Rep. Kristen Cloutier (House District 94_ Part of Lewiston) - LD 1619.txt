T estimony
of
Rep.
Kristen
Cloutier
in
support
of 
LD
1619,
An
Act
to
Impr ove
Maine's
Repr oductive
Privacy
Laws
Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Judiciary
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen
and
esteemed
colleagues
of
the
Joint
Standing 
Committee
on
Judiciary ,
my
name
is
Kristen
Cloutier
and
I
represent
House
District
94,
which 
includes
a
portion
of
my
hometown
of
Lewiston.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit 
testimony
as
a
proud
cosponsor
in
support
of
LD
1619,
An
Act
to
Impr ove
Maine's 
Repr oductive
Privacy
Laws.
Maine’ s
30-year -old
Reproductive
Privacy
Act
is
in
need
of
modernization.
The
passage
of
this 
legislation
has
the
ability
to
save
the
lives
of
people
who
are
facing
dire
medical
challenges
and 
complications
while
pregnant.
When
discussing
this
legislation,
it
is
crucial
to
acknowledge
that
abortions
later
in
pregnancy 
are
extremely
rare
,
representing
1%
of
all
abortions
across
the
United
States.
Lar gely ,
the
reason
for
an
abortion
later
in
pregnancy
is
because
the
pregnancy
is
no
longer 
viable,
the
child’ s
life
is
at
risk,
the
pregnant
person’ s
life
is
at
risk,
or
a
combination
of
these 
circumstances.
Right
now ,
Mainers
who
find
themselves
in
the
position
of
medically
needing
an 
abortion
later
in
pregnancy
need
to
travel
outside
of
our
state
to
seek
care.
Along
with
the 
emotional
toll
this
takes,
having
to
travel
to
another
state
for
medically-necessary
care
puts
an 
additional
financial
burden
on
those
who
may
not
be
able
to
af ford
it.
Receiving
the
tragic
information
from
your
physician
that
your
health
is
at
extreme
risk
if
your 
pregnancy
continues
to
full-term
is
something
no
pregnant
person
and
no
family
wants
to
hear . 
Passage
of
this
legislation
will
help
ensure
that
families
who
are
dealing
with
the
incredibly 
dif ficult
decision
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
will,
at
least,
not
be
criminalized
for
seeking
the
care 
they
need
right
here
in
Maine.
T oday ,
you
will
hear
the
stories
of
health
care
workers
who
had
to
break
the
news
to
families 
excited
to
welcome
their
child
into
the
world,
only
to
be
faced
with
a
heartbreaking
reality . 
Y ou’ll
also
hear
stories
from
pregnant
people
and
family
members
on
the
receiving
end
of
that 
life-altering
news.

I
trust
our
physicians
and
medical
practitioners
who
have
taken
an
oath
to
safeguard
the
health
of 
our
community
members,
and
I
trust
that
people
who
are
pregnant
can
make
the
best
decisions 
for
themselves
and
their
families.
I
hope
you
do,
too.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
important
legislation.
Sincerely ,
Rep.
Kristen
