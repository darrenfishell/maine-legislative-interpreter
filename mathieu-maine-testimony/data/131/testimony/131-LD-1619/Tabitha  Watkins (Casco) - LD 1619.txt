LD 1619
I, Tabitha Watkins, oppose the proposed bill LD1619. My opinion is that life begins 
at conception.  This bill will permit abortion right up until birth for any reason.   In 
my opinion this is heartless, radical and extreme. I firmly believe abortion is murder.
On a personal note, my mother was pregnant with me at the age of 17.   She and my 
father were young, not married, and very scared of their future.  My grandmother (her
mom) hated my father with a passion and was willing to do everything within her 
power to make sure they were not together and that the family's status remained 
intact.  She tried to pressure my mother into having an abortion- in other words, 
dismiss and remove the problem before anyone knew.  My parents were in the long 
run, able to be married and my life was saved.  I am now 49 years of age, married 
with two amazing children of my own, as well as a beautiful 3 year old 
granddaughter.  I was not able to speak for myself in my mother's womb and am so 
grateful that someone could fight against my traumatic death.  I had a right to life then
as do all the other unborn children whose voices cannot yet be heard.  
My husband and I financially support three, local, young children that are in poverty 
level homes in order to support life after birth.  We understand that much help and 
finances are needed to sustain these lives long after the choice for life is made.  Please
hear me clearly! There are those of us willing to sacrifice on a daily basis to support 
these unborn babies!
