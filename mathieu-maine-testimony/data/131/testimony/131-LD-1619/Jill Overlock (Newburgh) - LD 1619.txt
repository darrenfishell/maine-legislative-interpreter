LD 1619
I would like to join the majority of Mainers on both sides of the aisle to express my 
concerns about LD1619. Many feel that performing abortion protects the health of 
women. However, as a pelvic health physical therapist I have witnessed the physical 
and emotional scars of abortion in my clients, even years after it was done.
This bill is agrassive and unnecessary. I know A mother whose life was at risk in the 
24th week of pregnancy. Her child was born via c-section and is now a vibrant, joyful
two-year-old. The mother's health was quickly attended to and both of their lives 
saved. That baby, at 1 3/4 pounds and now a thriving toddler is fully human. To kill a 
child when both lives can be saved is an atrocity.
Thank you for considering my testimony.  For the sake of womens current and future 
health I urge you to vote ought not to pass on this agregious bill.
