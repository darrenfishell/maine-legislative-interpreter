LISA TURNER
Easton
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Lisa Turner, and I am a resident of 
Easton.  I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619.  I am unable to be at the 
hearing this Monday but, when I heard about LD 1619 and the fact that it would allow
abortions right up to birth for any reason, of perfectly healthy children, I could not 
stay quiet.  
I’m so thankful that abortion was not an everyday occurrence when my mother was 
pregnant with me. The Doctors discovered I had a rare heart defect that required 
surgery, but I was given the RIGHT to be BORN and I have gone on to be a 
productive part of society, working as a x ray tech for 30+ years.   Please take a 
minute to think of all the millions of viable babies, who would never have the chance 
to bless another human being, or grow up to become Doctors, Teachers, Pastors or 
even a Senator or Representative if this bill passes.   
I’m aware that there are only 7 states that allow late term abortion.  Maine does not 
need to be #8.  That would mean Maine would have one of the most extreme abortion 
laws in the United States.  As a native of Maine, I do not want that to be our legacy.  I
believe every life has the right to a future.   
You (God) saw me before I was born.  Every day of my life was recorded in your 
book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed. Psalm 139:16
