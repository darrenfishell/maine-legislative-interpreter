When I became pregnant with my first child, I knew I was going to have my baby and
never once considered an abortion. I believe God gave me a baby to love and protect. 
My first ultrasound showed a baby and then when I felt the baby move inside of me, I 
knew I could never kill it.  I believe God created babies to love and therefore I believe
this bill is so very wrong. I believe God the Creator made children to love and not kill.
God's word says in Psalms 139:16, "your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days 
ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."
