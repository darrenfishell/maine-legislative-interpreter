Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Ray Thombs from Union Maine . I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619.  
I speak to you as a father  who has experienced the loss of 2 of his four children. One b oy who left this 
world while in the womb and one who made it to 30 before  she entered  heaven’s  gates. My family and I 
have lived out tens of thousands of hours in  hospitals from Johns Ho pkins to our very own Maine 
Childrens Cancer Pro gram.  
Leave Title 22 alone. Honor the governor’s  claim  that she made during her campaign  where she said she 
has no plans t o change  this law.  LD1619 does not center around reproduction or health, and its 
deceptive title does not accurately depict its contents. Furthermore, this bill aims to eliminate standards and accountability, which will attract malicious actors. Therefore, my recommendation is to reject this bill. 
According to  a few  polls, there are at least 400,000 Maine voters, and potentially over 700,000 vo ters, 
including both pro -choice and pro -life advocates, who support the rejection of this bill. The will of the 
people is quite clear.  
If this proposed  bill were to move forw ard, know that a  few of us have put toge ther a draft bill called  
“The Endangered Beings Act ”.  The Preamble  states : Whereas every human being has a right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and whereas foetus infans humanus, the unborn human being, is a member of the human family and entitled to the same protection under the law, it is hereby declared 
that the purpose of this act is to provide protection and preservation for endangered human life, 
especially foetus infans humanus, and to ensure that the value of human life is respected and upheld by 
all members of society.  
 
Life for All  
Ray Thombs
