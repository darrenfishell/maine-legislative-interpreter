LD 1619
Governor Millâ€™s bill, LD 1619, will make Maine one of the most permissive abortion
states in the US. Permitting abortion right up to birth for any reason. This is heartless,
radical, and extreme. It is beyond abortion, it is infanticide, and it is an absolute moral
disgrace to the state of Maine. Please vote NO on LD1619.
