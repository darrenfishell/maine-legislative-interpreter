Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Robin Martin-Cooper and l reside in Caribou, Maine. As l have read through some 
of the arguments in favor of LD 1619, I came across the opinion of some who wish to terminate 
their baby's life due to birth defects. I would like to speak directly to that argument by sharing a 
story with you of a co-worker of mine. He and his wife we’re expecting their first baby. It wasn’t 
too far into the pregnancy that they discovered their child would have severe birth defects and 
would not survive. The option of abortion was available to them, however, they knew the truth, 
that this was a life created and not a random accident. As difﬁcult as the next few months were, 
they celebrated Baby “J” and loved him as much as any parent could love a child. When it 
came time for his birth, they prepared themselves to savor every moment with their precious 
son. While the doctors did not expect him to live long, his parents were able to bring him home 
and love on him for three days. The pictures said it all. He had such love in his eyes as he 
looked at his Mother. Baby “J” was NOT a mistake or disposable and no one could ever tell his 
parents that those few days were not worth it. 
Please, let's continue to let our great State of Maine be known for its beautiful coastline, lobsters 
and the outdoor life and NOT for this extreme abortion law. Please oppose LD 1619.
