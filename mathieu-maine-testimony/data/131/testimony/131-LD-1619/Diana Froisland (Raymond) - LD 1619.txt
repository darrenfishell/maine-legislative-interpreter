LD 1619
Dear members of the Judiciary Committee:
I urge you to vote NO on LD 1619. This bill will unnecessarily expand abortions in 
our state making Maine one of the most extreme and permissive states in the country. 
Abortion should not be allowed at any time for any reason, this is immoral. Life is a 
gift and should be treated in a respectful manner. Current law already allows for 
abortion where the life or health of the mother is threatened, which is typically the 
concern of most citizens. This law would also remove penalties for non-licensed 
persons to perform or aid in an abortion. How will this protect women in Maine when 
undergoing such a dangerous procedure? We've always been told that abortion should
be "safe and rare" this bill does not uphold either position but to the contrary makes it 
more dangerous and plentiful. I urge you to place priority on Maine citizens instead of
the abortion industry's profits.
