LD 1619
As a tax payer of Maine, I am not in agreement with LD 1619.  This bill would make 
Maine have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country.  No baby 
should be allowed to be killed, especially if it could survive outside of the womb.  I 
stand for life and there should not be any abortion at any time for any reason.  This 
Governor is pushing a very extreme agenda.  There are already laws on the books for 
medical necessity, so there is no need to consider making new legislation.  Also, 
making medical plans pay for this and allowing tax payer dollars to pay for abortions 
should not be allowed.  If people don't want to get pregnant, there are many ways to 
do this and education is the key.
