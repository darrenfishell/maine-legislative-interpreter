Dear Susan Pinette, 
I am writing with regards to LD 1619, for which there will be a hearing on 
Monday, May 1. I Wish my feelings to be made known to the committee 
that is dealing with this matter that I am NOT in favor of abortion, and 
especially late term abortion. Susan, it makes no sense to me that I could 
bear a child on Tuesday, but on Monday I could have killed that same 
child! I would hope that each committee member would consider their 
own children and ask, "Would I have aborted this child?" or "What if I had 
aborted this child?" 
I have not ﬁgured out how to send an email to these committee members 
(technology andl don't always get alongl), so I hope this can be passed 
along. 
Yours Truly, 
Patricia DuBrule
