LD 1619
To Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary Regarding LD 4619:
As someone who knocked on hundreds of doors this past election cycle in Southern 
Maine, the most common concern that I heard from voters was to the effect of, "if 
Paul LePage or Republicans are elected, they will change the abortion law currently 
on the books in Maine.”  This sentiment was heard over and over again, in many 
forms, but clearly the message had penetrated into the minds of voter upon voter, that 
"if Republicans win in November they will change the abortion laws in Maine."  
Well, Paul LePage was not elected, and Republicans do not have control of the House
or the Senate, but we are now talking about changing abortion laws in Maine.  
To pass this bill would be the height of hypocrisy, not only because of the promises 
that were made in debates and on campaign trails, but also because of the magnitude 
and severity by which Republicans were bludgeoned in TV, radio and online ads with 
the threat that, "if THEY are elected, THEY will change the laws on abortion in 
Maine.”
Please do not pass LD 1619 which will in fact change the current abortion laws in 
Maine; the opposite of the rhetoric and campaign promises coming from many of our 
currently elected leaders in Maine.
This is not how Mainers wish to be treated.
For this reason alone, I urge you vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1619.
Sincerely, 
Ryan McMann
