LD 1619
Thank you for representing me in our State Legislature.  Please vote NO on LD1619.  
This is a very extreme law, and tantamount to Infanticide here in our great state of 
Maine.  Moms and Dads deserve better choices here.  They deserve a chance to raise 
healthy, strong families with our support.  They deserve scientifically based 
information on Fertility, so that they can plan and space,  rather than kill, their 
children.  Prospective parents need support to raise their babies in a healthy 
environment.  Thank you for reading my testimony, and may God give you wisdom 
when you vote.
