LD 1619 - An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
 
Memorandum of Opposition 
Date:  May 01, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Judiciary  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1619 - An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Opposition of LD 1619 - An Act to Improve Maine's 
Reproductive Privacy Laws 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell, and I'm from Sanford. 
 
First of all this bill goes way beyond anything medically necessary to save the life of a mother. It is murder of 
those that some deem to “Not be human” or “Not have rights” Does this sound familiar? It should. An unborn 
child is its own entity and has the right to life.  
 
Secondly, the “Policy” change does not define what conditions it would be considered necessary. Could that be 
as simple as the mother not wanting to keep the baby? Removing this qualifier leaves this wide open to any 
whim from the patient or the doctor.  
After viability an abortion may be performed only when it is necessary 
to preserve the life or health of the mother in the professional judgment of a physician  
licensed pursuant to Title 32, chapter 36 or 48. 
 
Third, by removing the penalties, it makes the Policy unenforceable. Remember the scare of back alley 
abortions? If there is no penalty, and someone has difficulty convincing a professional that it's necessary, this is 
exactly what you will end up with.  
 
I've watched literally hours of hearings grilling Dr Nass for prescribing common antibiotics to help treat COVID-
19 Symptoms, but now the Legislature that loves crucifying doctors wants to allow anyone with a coathanger to 
do abortions? Where is the logic in this? Where is the standard of care that I keep hearing so much about?  
 
Please save the lives of countless babies and vote ought not to pass for this bill. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
