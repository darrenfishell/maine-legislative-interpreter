Subject: LD 1619 testimony 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
Dear Susan, 
I don't know an easy way to get a testimony into the hands of the Judiciary unless it's through you. I wish to 
have them see this point of view with regards LD 1619. If you could copy this for the entire committee, I would 
be very grateful. Or, failing that, could you let me know how to get this into their hands? 
Thank you,

Dear Chairs and Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
Please consider this angle on the abortion issue of LD 1619 before you. 
"Love Thy Neighbor" 
1. There are lots of women who let themselves get pregnant or have it forced upon them who are maybe even 
rightfully disturbed by it. 
2. They won't have "a life" with a kid. They can't afford a kid. They won't have their freedom. They're afraid. 
You name it. 
3. So they insist they should get the abortion. They kill the kid. 
4. What about the woman who is distressed by her neighbors? 
5. They disturb her sleep. They are nosy and nasty. They make her miserable. She can't afford to move or buya 
home. She's sick to her stomach. 
6. Can she insist that she be allowed to kill the neighbors? 
7. The right-to-choose-folks will say "no, but that the neighbors are not her body". 
8. Trouble is...is that neither is the fetus her body, no matter how loudly she might say so. While it has half of 
her code, it has completely unique DNA that has half of his code. It is a unique human being, just like her 
neighbors. 
9. Abortion is the murder of thy neighbor. Oppose LD 1619, Monday, May 1 in Augusta.
