Heather Higgins
Jefferson 
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Heather Higgins. I am a resident of 
Jefferson, Maine and I oppose LD 1619. 
LD 1619 is dangerous for the health and welfare of women. 
It is a dangerous legislation it is barbaric to both women and children! 
There is a reason most states in the United States would never allow this. Please donâ€™t
let the state of Maine become one of these few states that are trying to allow 
something this dangerous and inhumane. Please vote ought NOT to pass.
Thank You
