LD 1619
To the Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
In the 1800s famous French diplomat Alexis de Tocqueville said, "America is great 
because America is good.  If America ever ceases to be good she will cease to be 
great."  Legislators, he was right.  America stands at the threshold of the abyss of 
collapse.  We are under judgement because we are ceasing to be good.  We have lost 
our moral compass, without which any democracy cannot stand - for a democracy 
was created for a moral people.
To even consider LD 1619, a Bill so depraved and abhorrent, is beyond 
comprehension. For if we think it okay, and even right to have the legal granting to 
dismember and kill or leave to die a fully human being, than we are subhuman, void 
of all conscience and we must label ourselves among the serial killers and MS13 
gangs of our time, and among the worst of dictators and tyrants around the world 
whom we hypocritically are  so quick to condemn.  
Like those who supported and fought to keep slavery in the south, or those who 
covered their ears while the whistling trains full of Jews headed to Auchwitz crossed 
their lands, will you sign the death warrants on your fellow humans who cannot speak
for themselves?, or will you stand up for the least of these and say, "Enough, the cry 
of bloodshed screams up from our land" and say, "No, I will not support unrestricted 
wholesale murder of the innocent."  Now is the time to vote "NO".   Thank you for 
your time.   Sincerely, Eileen Gale, Wiscasset
