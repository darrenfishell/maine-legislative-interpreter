Sarah Clarke
Auburn
LD 1619
Dear Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Sarah Clarke from Auburn. I am writing in opposition to LD1619. This is
an extremely sad bill that allows abortions up to birth. Currently the law already 
allows for medical necessity in case of stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, etc. 
Please stand up for the life of the unborn children.
Please oppose this bill on behalf of the 65%+ of Mainers who do not want it.
Thank you.
