Testimony of Dr. Robert K. Evans of Bangor, Maine 
 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Dr. Robert K. Evans, and I am a 
resident of the city of Bangor, Maine.  I am here to testify in opposition to 
LD1619. 
 
Prior to moving to Maine, I spent 20 years working in the pharmaceutical 
industry, I hold a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, so I know when life begins, life begins at 
conception....and taking a viable life....in most cases a healthy unborn human life 
that does not seriously endanger the life of the mother is clearly wrong. 
 
Did you know that premature babies as young as 22 weeks survive?   
So clearly, they are viable. 
 
Did you know that premature babies as young as 6 weeks have a detectable 
heartbeat?   
 
Did you know that premature babies as young as 15 weeks feel pain and are more 
sensitive to pain than a full-term baby?  They are not just a clump of cells! 
 
I am totally opposed to LD1619 because it removes the viability restriction and 
allows unborn babies to be killed up until their birth.   This is clearly very very 
wrong.   
 
If LD1619 is passed, Maine will join only 6 other US states and several communist 
countries including China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and Laos that support full 
term abortion. 
 
Please vote against LD1619
