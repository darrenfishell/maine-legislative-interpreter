My name is Kayla Michaud and I am a resident of Enfield . I am the mother of 3 
children. My oldest daughter was born with a congenital heart defect. She fought for 
her life and underwent heart surgery when she was 7 days old and only 5lbs. My 
husband and I experienced firsthand the fear of losing our baby.  Let me be clear, her 
life was no less valuable because she had a problem with her heart. 
This radical bill would allow a mother to abort  her child at any time for any reason. 
Abortion is, by definition, murder: the unlawful taking of another human life.  
The difference between a baby being born & that life being celebrated or a baby being
aborted (at any point during pregnancy) boils down to one point: whether that life is 
wanted by his or her mother. This should not be. From the moment of conception, life
is valued by our creator and we are made in His image. Our government is obligated 
to protect and defend ALL human lives. 
Proponents of this horrific bill, I call on you to repent & turn to Jesus Christ for 
salvation. 
To this judiciary committee, I plead for you to oppose this abhorrent bill & protect the
unborn. 
Thank you.
