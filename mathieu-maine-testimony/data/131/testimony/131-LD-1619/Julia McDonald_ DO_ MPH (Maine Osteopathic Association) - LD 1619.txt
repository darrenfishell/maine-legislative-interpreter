Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
 
In Reference  to 
 
LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws  
Public Hear ing: Monday, May 1, 2023 12:00 PM,State House, Room 438  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen , and members of the joint standing committee on Judiciary, 
thank you for hearing my testimony .  
 
My name is Dr. Julia McDonald, DO, MPH and I a m double board cer tified by the American Academy 
of Family Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Family  Physicians. I teach at the Maine 
Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency and serve both as Clinical Associate Professor at the Dartmouth 
Geisel School of Medicine (N H) and as affiliate faculty at University of New England’s College of 
Osteopathic Medicine. As  an active member of the Maine Osteopathic Association, I am providing 
written testimony on behalf of my physician colleagues in support of LD1619.  
 
The Maine Osteopathic Association is a professional organization representing approximately 400 
osteopathi c physicians and an additional 700 residents and students. Our mission is to “serve the 
Osteopathi c profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated effort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to ensure the availability of  quality osteopathic health care to the 
people of this State.  
 
We have watc hed with horror the erosion of patient and physician rights around the United States as 
evidence -based medicine is called into question by political efforts to restrict healthcare,  including 
abortion and other pregnancy related care. Seeing colleagues and their communities grapple with the 
threat of criminalization for providing evidence -based medicine is chilling and bodes poorly for patient 
outcomes, threatening  the health of this  nation’s families and communities. We commend Governor 
Mills, Senate Pr esident Jackson, and House Leader Talbot Ross for their leadership on this legislation 
which looks to safeguard Mainers and health care providers.  
 
LD 1619 makes three important change s to our Reproductive Privacy Act :  
• It places decision s around pregnancy where they belong: between the pregnant person and their 
doctor.  
• It also would also provide a safety shield for people who support patients getting abortion care 
by removing criminal  penalties for the trained clinicians who provide abortion  care and also for 
anyone who helps someone access care, including self -managing their abortion care, in Maine.  
• Finally, this bill removes antiquated and invasive data collection requirements for a bortion 
patients and providers . 
 

 2 Within our field, there is a diversity of personal opinions about many medical interventions, but our 
physicians can agree that medical decisions are best made by trained health care professionals 
confidentially and private ly with our patients. Our patient s put their trust in us to use our best judgment 
to offer them medically accurate information and high -quality medical care. Mainers value their 
reproductive rights and freedoms, and this bill will ensure no one is denied t he freedom to make these 
very private medica l decisions . 
 
It is for these reasons the MOA supports LD 1619 and recommends that you vote Ought to Pass.
