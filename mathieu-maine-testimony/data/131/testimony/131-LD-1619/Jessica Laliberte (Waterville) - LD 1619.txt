Re: Testimony in OPPOSITION to  LD 1619, An Act  to Improve Maine ’s Reproductive Privacy Laws  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary:  
 
My name is Jessica L. Lalibe rte. I am a resident of Waterv ille and a life long Roman Catholic. My Catholic 
faith has always been my guiding princip le and moral  compass.  Life begins at the moment  of conception  
and ends at natural  death.  
 
I veh ement ly oppose LD 1619, An Act  to Improve Maine ’s Reproductive Privacy Laws  as well as the 
other two abortion bills  LD 776 , Resol ution , Proposing an Amendment to the Cons titution of Maine to 
Establish the Right to Bodily Autonomy, and LD 1343 , An Act to Protect the Reproductive Freedom of 
Maine People by Preempting the Field of Abortion Regu lation.  
 
Children are some of our most precious asse ts. They are also some of the most vulnerable.  Many times,  
in this building , we hear all lives matter.  LD 1619 is a v ile, egregious , and vicious attack on human life.   
 
If passed , this le gislation would allow the execution of an i nnocent, defens eless baby right up until the 
moment of birth. That  is murder . If you support this a troci ous bill , you will have the blood of murdered 
babies on your hands.  
 
Many of the  bill’s spo nsors and co -spon sors oppose harsh penalties on criminal offenders  and op pose 
the death penalty because they believe peop le deserve a second chance and rehabilitation. LD 1619 
ends the life of a baby.  
 
I beg you to do the right thing and vote ought not to pass  on these bills.
