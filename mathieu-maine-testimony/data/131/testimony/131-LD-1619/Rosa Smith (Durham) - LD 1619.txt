Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Rosa Smith and I am 19 years old and live in Durham. I oppose LD 
1619 because I don’t think Maine should allow babies to be aborted who can 
survive outside the womb. 
I was born in China and adopted at three years old. When I was a baby, I was 
labeled as un-adoptable by the people who ran my orphanage because of my 
disabilities. I was too small to speak up for myself, but a lady named Julie came to 
the orphanage and convinced the director that someone in America would want to 
adopt me. Because of Julie speaking up for me, I was adopted by a loving family 
in Maine. I am here today to speak up for unborn babies who can’t speak up for 
themselves. Some of them may have disabilities like I do. I know what it is like to 
be small and not valued but even though some people say these babies aren’t 
valuable or deserving of life, I know they are. Some people in China didn’t thinkI 
was valuable and deserving of a better life in an adoptive family, but they were 
wrong. 
Please vote against LD 1619 and protect these unborn babies who can’t speak up 
and defend themselves. They are valuable!
