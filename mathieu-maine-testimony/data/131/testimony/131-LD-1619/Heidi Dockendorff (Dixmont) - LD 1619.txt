Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: . 
My name is Heidi Dockendorff, and I'm a resident of Dixmont. l’m here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1619. 
I grew up here in Maine. Upon graduating high school, I followed my dream of attending college in 
California. 
The beginning of my second year in college, l discovered I was pregnant. The father wanted 
nothing to do with me. 
The thought of abortion -I am ashamed to admit~ did cross my mind. Though I knew, if I took my 
baby's life, I would take mine too. 
For this baby was innocent; she had nothing to do with coming into existence. I thought of 
adoption but this baby was a part of me. 
On my 21st birthday, I was told I had cervical cancer. The doctor brought up abortion, but I said no 
So I left college and returned home to Maine, giving birth on Easter morning to my beautiful baby 
girl, Audrey. 
Shortly after, I had the cen/ical cancer removal procedure. 
My second baby, Keith, was born six weeks early. He weighed 4lb, lounce. Keith was so tiny you 
could hold him in the palm of your hand. 
He remained in the hospital for two weeks after his birth, because his lungs needed to develop a 
little more. 
For years, he seemed smaller than boys his age, but looking at him now you'd never have guessed 
he was a preemie. 
The Lord has blessed my husband and me, and our family. 
The Lord’s grace and mercy has sustained us through many trials over our current 38 years 
together. 
He has been and will ever be faithful. 
Please: Be faithful to those who are most innocent, pure, and unable to defend themselves. 
Oppose this inhumane bill LD1619. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
