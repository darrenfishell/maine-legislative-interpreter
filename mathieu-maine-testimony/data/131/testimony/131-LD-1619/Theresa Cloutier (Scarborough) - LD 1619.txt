LD 1619
Dear Judiciary Committee,
I'm a resident of Scarborough, Maine asking you to oppose LD 1619 in committee 
and ask you to consider the data that shows the risk it poses to women's health.
The LD 1619 bill does not take into consideration the full impact on a woman's 
health.  The reason why the majority of the states (45 out of 52), restrict late term 
abortion is due to the risks of late term abortion on the health of the mother.  Thorp, 
2012 research reported - "late term abortion places women at greater risk which 
includes surgical complications, subsequent preterm birth, and mental health issues."  
Abortion is already available.  Why wouldn't it be rare and restricted if it puts 
women's health at risk?
There is already current law in place that allows abortion up to viability (24-26) 
weeks, and late term includes threats to the mother's life.  Additionally, Foster and 
Kimport, 2013, provide data from a University California study of 400 women from 
16 abortion facilities who had abortions after 26 weeks. The study indicates, those 
who sought late term abortions were for fetal anomalies or life endangerment.  Even 
Abortion Rights advocates insist late term procedures are performed only in dire 
circumstances involving risk to the life of the mother or in cases of severe fetal 
anomaly.
LD 1619 is a form of extreme legislation expanding abortion beyond viability which 
would be up to birth, and does not take into consideration the negative effects of late 
term abortion on the health of the mother.  There is consistent medical research data 
that supports this and deserves further attention.  I'm appealing to you to vote no on 
passing this bill.
Regards,
Theresa Cloutier
