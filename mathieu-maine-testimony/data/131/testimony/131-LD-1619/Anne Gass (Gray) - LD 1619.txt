Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Distinguished Members of the Joint Committee  
on the Judiciary : 
 
My name is Anne Gass and I’m writing  in support of LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine's 
Reproductive Privacy Laws .  
 I support new proposed language regarding collecting data on abortions performed, stripped of 
any identifying information.  
 I also strongly support the language change to eliminat e “to preserve the life or health of the 
mother,” and to instead add the proposed lang uage when it is necessary “ in the professional 
judgment of a physician 21 licensed pursuant to Title 32, chapter 36 or 48 .” What we ’ve seen in 
states that have enacted strict abortion regulations is that the phrase “to preserve the life or 
health of the mot her” is far too vague. For example, d oes a  woman have to  have a  30% chance  
of death or disability in order to qualify for an abortion, or must she b e actually dying (in a n ICU, 
with her system s shutting down? ) That ’s a wide range. The lack of  clarity makes  physicians and 
hospitals nervous, and a s a result a pro cedure that in most cases is straightforward and safe 
becomes far more complicated and leads to greater health risks for women .  
 The state should not insert itself between women and their health care providers regarding their decision whether or not  to terminate a pregnancy.   
 
Please suppo rt the se nsible language proposed under LD 1619.
