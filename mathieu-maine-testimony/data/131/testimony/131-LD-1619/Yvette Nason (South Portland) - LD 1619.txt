LD 1619
April 27, 2023
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Yvette Nason from South Portland, Maine. 
I am a Mother of 3 and a Grandmother 7. 
My Twins were born at 31 weeks; now thriving adults with children of their own. 
I am testifying in opposition of  LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive 
Privacy Laws.
Late Term Abortion is too extreme and over 65% of Mainers don't want late term 
abortion. 
Abortion at Any time, for Any reason is too extreme for Maine. 
This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. 
We don't want Maine abortion tourism.  
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
to see pass. 
Respectfully,
Yvette Nason
