From the moment of a sperm and egg joining together, life has begun.  From that 
moment on, it is continual change, development, and growth.  At six weeks there is a 
heartbeat.  All this can and has been scientifically proven. This is not a matter of 
opinion.  These are facts.  Literally, facts of life.
If scientists found anything on another planet that showed signs of growth, change, 
and/or development, there would be cheering and excitement over the idea that life 
has been detected.  If a heartbeat was heard on that thing the headlines would read, 
"Life has been found on planet ______ !".  
But here in Maine there are people turning a blind eye to truth, covering their ears to 
not hear that beating heart, and saying with their mouths it is ok to kill an unborn 
baby.  Abortion is murder.  Plain and simple.  It is willfully ending the life of a human
being ... a child created in the image of God.
Legally allowing this child to be killed is horrendous.  How can it be ok and legal to 
kill an unborn child at full term, but if that child were born and the next day the doctor
killed that baby, he or she would be arrested and charged with murder?  What is the 
difference between these two days?  Only because the baby is on the outside, not 
inside its mother.  The facts remain the same.  A living baby is just as much alive 
inside its mother as it is outside its mother.  
Please vote against LD 1619.  We are talking about tiny, precious babies that can't 
speak up for themselves.  We must value all life, from conception to death.
