LD 1619
Hello,
I am a mother writing to implore you to please vote ought NOT to pass on LD 1619.
This bill goes beyond the scope of bodily autonomy and women's rights. In the third 
trimester, the woman has had many months to make a decision on abortion. A 
c-section and adoption at this point would be safer, allow the woman whatever 
freedom she desires, and allows the baby to live and be adopted by one of the many 
families waiting to adopt a baby. 
You can be pro-choice and not support abortion at birth. Both common sense and 
science teach us that there is no reason to go through with this.
