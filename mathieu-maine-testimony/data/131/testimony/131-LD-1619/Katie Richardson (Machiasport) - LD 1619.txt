LD 1619
I opposed LD1619!! This is the most ridiculous proposal! As if there is any difference
between life before or after the baby passes through its mothers skin barrier.  If 
anyone dared hurt a baby after it was born they would be in serious trouble, a 
murderer!  There is no way around this that doesn’t make it murder! People that agree
with this are blinded by “women’s rights” that are based on emotion and not The 
Truth. These women need help, but that is NOT the kind of help they need. Killing a 
baby  to make themselves feel better? It is as heinous as it sounds, and I truly feel 
sorry and scared for those in charge of passing this if it makes it that far. They will 
have to answer for this directly when their days here are done. Murder is murder 
regardless of how many good feelings or days it gives a woman- it’s choosing 
happiness over murder.
