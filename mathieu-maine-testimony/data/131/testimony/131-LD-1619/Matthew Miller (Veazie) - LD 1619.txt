LD 1619
Firstly, I want to thank our elected representatives on the Judiciary Committee for 
taking the time to hear the public's concerns regarding LD 1619 and providing me the 
opportunity to submit written testimony against this proposed Act.
My greatest apprehension regarding abortion is that promoters of such a draconian 
medical procedure consider it a RIGHT; specifically a woman's RIGHT to terminate a
pregnancy for whatever reason she chooses.  Quite frankly a RIGHT to murder.
My understanding is that rights are ONLY granted to people by either God or the 
State.  There is no mention in the Bible, which is the word of God, that gives humans,
man or woman, the right to willfully terminate a pregnancy.  Nor is it mentioned in 
the US Constitution or the Bill of Rights that a person has the RIGHT to intentionally 
end the viability of a fetus.   
Both the Bible and our Constitution consider murder a capital offense with severe 
consequences.  Murder is NOT a God given RIGHT or a RIGHT granted under the 
laws of the United States, State of Maine or any municipality. 
I therefore, my dear representatives, implore you to reject LD 1619 based on doctrines
established by spiritual morality and legislative fiat.
