LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Natalie Salavarria and I live in Kenduskeag. I am the parent of four adult 
children and the grandmother of Benjamin, 16 months old and Evelyn, 5 months old. I
am also a Registered Nurse who worked for over 30 years in the specialty of neonatal 
intensive care. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619, regarding late-term 
abortion. 
This abortion bill is so extreme that it allows for abortion up to birth, regardless of 
whether or not a baby can survive outside of the womb. We have made great 
advancements in the care of prematurely born babies and I have personally witnessed 
the birth, growth, and development of countless babies, some, as young in their 
development  as 25 weeks gestation. The miracle of life is not something that can be 
ignored, nor should it be in man's hands to snuff it out. Babies  are born with the drive
to survive, and even they have an awareness that every person has an important role 
to fill in this world. Over and over, the medical community has been astounded at 
how these babies grow and thrive, even though they left the womb early. I grieve for 
the babies who have never been allowed the right to be born. I grieve for we who miss
out on all they could have offered to the world, all they would have become.  
Statistics show that most Mainers are not in favor of this extreme legislation and do 
not want late term abortions to become legal. Our current law already addresses 
viability and allows for medical  necessity of abortion in certain cases. 
I am asking that you please oppose this extreme and unnecessary bill. Thank you for 
acting justly and voting against this bill.
