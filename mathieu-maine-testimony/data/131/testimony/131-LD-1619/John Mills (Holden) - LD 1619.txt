John Mills
Holden
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
     My name is John Mills and I live in Holden.  I am testifying in opposition to LD 
1619, "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws."
     My wife, Jenny, and I are the parents of three grown children.  I was able to 
witness the birth of each of them.  If you have children I hope that you also have the 
memory of how small and precious your children were after they were first born.
     Our oldest daughter is expecting our first grandchild in August.  We look forward 
to meeting this unique and loved person then.
   I have read the bill and have these comments.
     It is clear that LD 1619 will allow abortions up to the moment of birth for any 
reason.  This is extreme and is not what I or most Mainer's support.
     Are you comfortable with allowing the killing of an unborn child in the womb who
could live outside of the womb at that time?
     The current law allows for medically necessary abortions in the case of stillbirth, 
ectopic pregnancy, and other situations related to preserving the life and health of the 
mother.
     I do not want Maine to have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the nation.
     I do not want women to come to Maine for late-term abortions that are not 
available to them where they live.
     How will women's lives be improved by the changes proposed by this bill?  
     The fact is more babies will be killed.
     Please consider the preciousness and innocence of all unborn children.  They have 
the potential to enrich the lives of those who know and love them.  Just like your 
children and grandchildren have and will.
     May God give you wisdom in making your decision about supporting this bill or 
opposing this bill.
     Thank you for considering my views.
