Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, LD 1619 - “An Act to 
Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws”, May 1, 2023.
Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, and Members of the Committee:
My name is Katherine Martin. I am testifying in support of LD 1619.
I believe this bill is critical for the State of Maine to firmly establish set law in view 
of the Supreme Courts decision that the rights allotted to women regarding their 
health and reproductive decisions be determined by each state’s legislature.
As a citizen of Maine, and of the United States I value most highly the Separation of 
Church and State. For me, this is a hallmark of our freedoms, and I feel my rights 
threatened by a religious minority who wish to impose their beliefs and practices on 
the entirety of our nation. As a woman, a parent and a grandparent I am horrified at 
the movement toward theocracy that the regulation of women’s health represents. 
LD 1619 “An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws” stands for my 
freedom from religious persecution. It will protect Maine residents from an invasive 
breach of personal privacy, a breach which could result in harm to an individual. The 
bill further places health decisions where they belong, in the hands of the individual 
and their physician. Finally, this bill prevents undo restrictions regarding health 
caregivers by indicating the training and licensing required.
