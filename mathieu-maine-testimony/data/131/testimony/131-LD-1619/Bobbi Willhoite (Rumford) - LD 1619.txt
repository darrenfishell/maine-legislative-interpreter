LD 1619
Honorable Members of this Judiciary Committee,
Thank-you for this opportunity to express my opinion.
I have no new perspective to present.  I have no emotional personal story to share.  I 
have never testified or submitted testimony prior to this. I am just simply, yet again, 
another constituent of this great state who so strongly opposes LD 1619 that to remain
uninvolved and silent about this would be an injustice against humanity that I would 
have a very difficult time living with.
I am all for progress; however, just the fact that we would even consider the passing 
of LD 1619 makes it obvious that we, as the human race, are not progressive at all but
rather quite the contrary, as it indicates a devaluing of human life.
Please, please vote "Ought Not to Pass" on LD 1619.
Thank-you for your time and attention.
Thank-you for hearing my heart on this matter,
