My Name is Abigail McMahon, and I am a resident of the town of Oakland. I am in 
strong opposition of this bill. First, the title insists it is “improving reproductive 
rights” which is simply untrue. Murdering full term babies is hardly furthering 
reproductive rights for women, it is simply killing innocent babies. This bill is 
targeted at killing full term babies, right up until delivery. This is ethically and 
morally wrong. I watched my mother suffer from severe antepartum and postpartum 
depression. She did not seek any psychological help; and because of that she nearly 
aborted my sister. There was pressure from the family to abort and thankfully, by the 
grace of God she did not. Kate is 22 years old, my best friend and an active and 
productive member of society. Simply put, the baby my mother would have aborted 
was an individual, NOT my mothers body. She would have been murdered in cold 
blood. So I’m closing, I implore you to reject this bill in its entirety.
