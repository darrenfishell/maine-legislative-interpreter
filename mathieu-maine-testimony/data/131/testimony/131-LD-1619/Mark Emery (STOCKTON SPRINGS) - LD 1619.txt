LD 1619 testimony
     My name is Mark Emery from Stockton Springs Maine, and I am respectably 
asking that the members of the Judiciary committee vote NO on LD 1619.  Under the 
current law in Maine, an abortion is legal until viability.  Viability is defined as the 
stage of pregnancy when an unborn child has developed to the point where it would 
be able to survive outside of the uterus with medical assistance and normally occurs 
during the 24-26 weeks of pregnancy.  This allows any pregnant women the time to 
make the decision to have an abortion if that is the choice she decides to make.
     While the subject of abortion is always contentious between pro-choice and 
pro-life advocates, the current Maine law already has language that an abortion can 
take place after viability if it is necessary to protect the life or health of the mother 
which safeguards those that need a later term abortion.
    This new proposed law is a much more radical position that most citizens in Maine,
including many pro-choice people, do not support and would allow for an abortion on 
a child that has a fully functioning body and brain and will feel the incredible pain 
that this abortion would cause.  This would be one of the most extreme abortion laws 
in the United States and should never be a part of our culture.  I ask again that you 
would vote no on this bill.  Thank you.
