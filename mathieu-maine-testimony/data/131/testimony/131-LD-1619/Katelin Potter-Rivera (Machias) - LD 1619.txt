My name is Katelin Potter-Rivera, and I’m a resident of Machias, Maine.
Taking care of children begins in the womb.
I have a one year old baby girl. You cannot convince me that she isn’t her own person
now and you cannot convince me that she wasn’t her own person when she was in the
womb. You also cannot ignore that she needs me now just as much as she needed me 
in the womb. If she were left alone, she would not be able to survive. She’s one year 
old and needs constant protection and care now as she did in the womb. 
Please turn your eyes to truth and justice. Think of the abortion process in late term 
abortions, disassembling limbs and pieces of the most tiny and precious humans, 
re-assembling them on a tray to make sure the doctor got all of them because someone
didn’t want them to live anymore. Unborn doesn’t mean not alive. Hence why due 
dates are often misjudged and babies are born premature. My baby was born almost 
two weeks after her due date. Her nails were long and her skin was peely- the signs of
a very grown child in the womb. And the only difference is that one day you couldn’t 
see her and the next day you could. We should not wipe away the bodies and souls of 
little ones to simply meet our American dreams and timelines. Please do not lead our 
state into further injustice.
