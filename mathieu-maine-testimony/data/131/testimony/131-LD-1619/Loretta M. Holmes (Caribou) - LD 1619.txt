Madame
Chair;
Mister
Chair ,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee:
My
name
is
Loretta
M.
Holmes.
I
live
in
Caribou.
I
am
the
parent
of
three
adult
children,
and
the
grandmother
of
6
delightful
grandchildren.
I
am
contacting
you
because
I
oppose
LD
#1619.
“
An
Act
to
Improve
Maine's
Reproductive
Privacy
Laws.”
If
passed
LD
#1619
doesn’t
protect
Maine’ s
most
innocent,
vulnerable
citizens.
Our
state’ s
popular
slogan
may
have
to
be
changed
to
“Maine:
The
W ay
Life
Should
Be
Except
for
Unborn
Maine
citizens.”
Y our
constituents
have
made
it
possible
for
you
to
have
the
privilege
to
represent
us
in
Augusta.
I
implore
you
to
use
your
power
to
wisely
consider
the
necessity
of
protecting
all
of
the
people
in
Maine.
If
Maine’ s
unborn
people
aren’t
allowed
to
be
protected
in
this
state,
will
any
person
ever
be
safe
at
any
stage
of
life
here
in
Maine?
Make
Maine
an
example
of
Dirigo,
Latin
for
“I
lead
or
I
direct”,
by
leading
our
nation
in
refusing
to
allow
the
late
term
abortion
of
viable
children
that
LD
#1619
would
permit
if
it
were
to
become
a
law .
As
elected
members
of
the
Maine
State
Legislature
you
have
been
given
the
opportunity
to
be
here
for
a
time
such
as
this:
a
crucial
moment
in
deciding
the
future
of
Maine.
Please
use
the
power
you
have
been
entrusted
with
to
vote
against
LD
#
1619.
Thank
you.
Respectfully
yours,
Loretta
