Kara Cox
Augusta
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Kara N Cox and I live in Augusta. I am the parent of three daughters as 
well as an active resource parent caring for children currently in the Maine foster care 
system. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619.
I am testifying because as a foster parent I have personally cared for and have many 
friends who have cared for children born prematurely. I have seen these children grow
up and live successful and productive lives. These lives are just as precious and 
important as those born full term. I’ve seen the difficulties that come with children 
born and not wanted or born to parents unable to care for them. It can be hard, there 
are struggles, and sometimes lifelong impact; however, this does not negate their right
to be born. 
The statistics here in Maine show that the majority of Mainers do not agree with 
late-term abortion. Governor Mills stated that even she felt Maine’s laws didn’t need 
to be changed. I know the objections of what about the mother's life, however I ask 
you to consider, what about the CHILD’s life? 
The bill as written now leaves an immense amount of gray area regarding late term 
abortions and I believe that is extreme and is a very slippery slope for Maine people 
and Maine’s unborn citizens. 
Please oppose this unnecessary and drastic bill. Thank you.
