LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws 
Governor Janet Mills, House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, Senate President Troy Jackson, and 
Distinguished Members of the Committee on Judiciary [LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s 
Reproductive Privacy Laws] 
My name is Magdalena Escudero-Kane. I am from Brunswick, Maine. I am speaking on behalf 
of the Bowdoin Reproductive Justice Collation. I am writing to support LD 1619: An Act to 
Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws.- 
Maine's Reproductive Privacy Act is crucial for safeguarding reproductive rights and justice. 
This updated legislation marks a signiﬁcant step towards achieving these objectives within 
Maine. The removal of the gestational ban is particularly crucial as it ensures that pregnant 
individuals in Maine have access to comprehensive healthcare services that cater to their 
physical and mental health needs. The government should not interfere with pregnancy 
decisions; pregnant individuals must have the autonomy to make informed choices in 
consultation with healthcare providers. Limiting abortion access beyond 24 weeks of gestation 
can exacerbate the difficulties experienced by many people in Maine. There is also the added 
concern of criminalization and harassment toward individuals seeking abortion care. Maine 
needs to revamp its data collection practices to protect patient safety. The criminalization of 
people assisting pregnant individuals with self-managed abortions is another concern. While sclf~ 
managed abortion is safe, criminalizing this practice can severely hurt pregnant individuals. It is 
essential to support this legislation to ensure that individuals can access the care they need , 
without fear of legal repercussions. 
I strongly encourage you to heed the voices of those who have spoken about their personal 
experiences with abortion. While I do not have a personal story to share today, I am here to 
express my concem over the impact this legislation could have on my own life and all Mainers. I 
have witnessed the challenges that individuals face when seeking legal abortions, including 
friends who have had to travel for up to 16 hours to obtain necessary care. I have also seen them 
overwhelmed by the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden accompanying the process. These are the real 
consequences awaiting individuals seeking abortions beyond 24 weeks in Maine. It is my sincere 
hope that you will take action to support those seeking abortion care within the state of Maine. 
Thm you for giving me your time. The removal of the gestational ban, improving safety in data 
collection, and updating the criminal code will all improve the lives of Mainers. I urge you to 
vote for LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
Sincerely, 
Magdalena Escudero-Kane
