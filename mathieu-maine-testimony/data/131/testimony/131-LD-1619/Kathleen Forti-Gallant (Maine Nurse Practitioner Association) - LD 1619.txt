RE: LD 1619  
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, & members of the Judiciary Committee, 
            I am a citizen of Stetson Maine and work as a Nurse Practitioner in Bangor Maine. I am 
writing to you on behalf of the Maine Nurse Practitioner Association (MNPA) to urge you to 
support LD 1619 ‘An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Prviacy Laws.’ We agree with 
removing the unnecessary components of data collection to protect privacy in section 1 and 
agree with decriminalization in section 3. We support continuing current practice for nurse 
practitioners in Maine but would advocate amending the bill to include nurse practitioners 
instead of the physician only language. 
Please feel free to contact me or our association if any questions, 
Respectfulll submitted, 
Kathleen Forti-Gallant DNP
