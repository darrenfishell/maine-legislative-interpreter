I’m an Spanish exchange student I’m 15 years old 
In Spain and most of Europe we can only abort until 14 weeks we would never get to 
this point. This is just America. 
And in Spain we have a Christian believes and values. What a coincidence? Right.
The state motto of Maine I’m sure you know, is dirigo, which means I lead. Do you 
really want to be leading your country into such a horrific action?
Also where is the freedom of speech that America is known for.
It is shameful that you are cutting our time in half and cutting us off from speaking 
because you want to go home early. We are tired too but we are standing up for the 
right to life. Clearly you can see how committed the pro-lifers are. 
Again I’m just 15 years old but think about what you are doing and how many lives 
are going to be taken away
Thanks for listening 
God bless
