LD 1619
Dear Mr. Chairman and Members of the Judiciary Committee:
I respectfully request that you vote "ought not to pass" on this bill, LD 1619.
This bill does not allow unborn children the opportunity to defend themselves.
We must choose life not death. Adoption is always an option.
You must reject and vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1619.
Marilyn Delo
