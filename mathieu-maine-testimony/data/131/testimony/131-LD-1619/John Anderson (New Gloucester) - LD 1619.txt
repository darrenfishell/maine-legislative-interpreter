John Anderson
New Gloucester
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is John C. Anderson and I live in New Gloucester.  I am a follower of the 
Lord Jesus Christ and a parent to five children two of whom were miscarriages that I 
will meet again in heaven.  I firmly believe that children are a blessing and gift from 
the Creator of ALL life, Yahweh.  I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619 An 
Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.
As a Christ follower, I believe that life begins at conception and carries through until 
that person breathes their last breath.  The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
United States Constitution declare that governments cannot deprive any person of 
"life, liberty, or property" without due process of law.  Governments cannot deprive 
any person of life.  This includes conception up through the twenty-third and 
twenty-fourth weeks gestational age when viability outside the womb has been 
reached and continuing through to birth.  Late-term abortion would be an extreme, 
unnecessary option when adoption and other opportunities are available for that child.
I have read statistics that over 65% of Mainers do not agree with late-term abortion.  
According to a well known institute, only one percent to three percent of all abortions 
are performed for medical reasons.  Government intervention is not needed for such a 
small percentage.  The CDC found that in 2020, point nine percent of abortions were 
performed at greater than or equal to twenty-one weeks gestation.  Again, government
intervention is not needed for such a small percentage.  I am writing this testimony to 
speak up for those who need the opportunity for life and to, one day, speak up for 
others and become contributing men and women of this nation.
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
see pass.  Thank you
