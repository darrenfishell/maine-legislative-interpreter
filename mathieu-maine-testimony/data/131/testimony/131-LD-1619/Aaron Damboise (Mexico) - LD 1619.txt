Testimony to the Judiciary Committee 
RE: L.D. 1619, H.P. 1044 
Greetings to the Members of the Judiciary Committee: 
My name is Fr. Aaron Damboise. I am a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of 
Portland and the pastor of the Parish of the Holy Savior in Mexico. I am also the 
State Chaplain for the Maine State Council of the Knights of Columbus. I am here 
to oppose the passage of L.D. 1619. 
In my ﬁfteen years of priestly ministry, I've encountered many different pastoral 
situations. Some of those have involved parents grieving the loss of a child. 
Included in that group are post-abortive parents. I counseled a mother who spent 
thirty years struggling with nightmares when she saw what she believed to be the 
face of her baby. I've counseled fathers who encouraged their girlfriends or wives 
to have an abortion, only to ﬁnd themselves grieving and wondering what kind of 
person their child would have become. I've heard the stories of women who were 
forced to have an abortion as young adults by their fathers or boyfriends because 
the child would have been born out wedlock and the family didn't want other 
people to think that their daughter was "that kind of girl." These women, while 
possessing the freedom to procure an abortion, often didn't feel they had a choice 
and have spent a great part of their adult lives healing from the hurt and pain that 
this decision, made under great duress, has caused them. 
Abortion has many victims, and the wounds it inﬂicts are deep and long-lasting. 
Increasing access to abortion during the later periods of pregnancy will only serve 
to expose more Maine women to potentially harmful and devastating situations. 
Because of this, I strongly urge the members of this committee to reject L.D. 1619. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Rev. Aaron Damboise, Pastor 
Parish of the Holy Savior, Mexico, ME
