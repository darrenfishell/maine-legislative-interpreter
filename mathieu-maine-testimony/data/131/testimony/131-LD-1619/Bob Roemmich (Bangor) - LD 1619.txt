Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Bob Roemmich, and I am a resident of Bangor. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
First of all, I would like to raise a question for all to think about. How is it that, due to 
medical progress from the 1960’s to now, doctors can actually operate on a human 
life inside the womb of the mother and yet when it comes to canceling that life, 
which many say is only a fetus, doctors can deny that life any chance of sun/ival? 
This bill is very wrong for Maine. All life should and must be considered sacred. 
According to the many people that I have talked to in the medical ﬁeld, this decision 
to have an abortion to help the health of the mother is a very lame excuse to enda 
life. ‘ 
If there are any complications, it usually comes after the baby is born and can 
be addressed medically in a veiy quick manner. 
My story is that when my birth mother was carrying me, she undenivent a couple of 
surgeries that were medically needed. She was also advised that I would be still- 
born. I assure you that I was not stillborn. My wife would not have me as her hus- 
band and my children would not have me for their father. This bill, if it were in place 
at the time of my birth, would have ended my life before I ever saw the light of day. 
When considering an unlicensed person performing any abortion procedure asa 
result of this bill, the accountability factor would be non-existent. All people must be 
responsible for their actions in regards to taking lives, whether it be in a doctor of- 
fice, hospital, or the street. 
I also oppose LD~776 as well as LD-1343. 
Thank you for your time and please strongly consider a “NO’ vote or a “ought to not 
to pass” vote on LD-1619.
