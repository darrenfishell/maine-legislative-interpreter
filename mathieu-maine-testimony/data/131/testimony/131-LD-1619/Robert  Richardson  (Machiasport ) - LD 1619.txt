Abortion at any term is MURDER . God gives life .  These women say “my body my 
right!” . I agree they have a body and they have rights to their own body , but a baby 
in their womb is not
“ their body “ it’s a separate human being , with its own body, soul, and spirit . Their 
body their right , to what? take a human life that isn’t their own ?To kill a human 
being at any point after conception is murder and to kill a voiceless , defenseless, 
innocent life ?  Sad , this is where we are at in our culture today . pregnant woman 
does not have the right to terminate a life that is not their own, It’s not their life to 
take.
