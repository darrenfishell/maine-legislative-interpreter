My name is Dorothy Eldridge and I live in Newport. I believe that abortion at ANY time for ANY reason is 
wrong. I had a friend whose daughter was born extremely early at under two pounds. Today she is a 
healthy eight year old. This is proof that no man knows the outcome of the viability of any baby. 
Psalm 139:16 states “Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in your book were written every 
one of them, the days that were formed for me, When as yet there were none of them.” This shows God 
knows all of our days before we are born.  
I believe as I think the majority of Mainers do that LD1619 is much too strong for Maine and I urge you 
to oppose this unbelievable law that would be one of the most drastic laws in place in the United States. 
Thank you.
