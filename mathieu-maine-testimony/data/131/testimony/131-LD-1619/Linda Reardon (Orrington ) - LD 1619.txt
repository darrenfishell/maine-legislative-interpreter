This bill should not pass at all. Abortion is not a right. I’m a nurse who has taken care 
of many patients faced with the choice because of medical issues not birth control. 
I’ve watched them suffer with choices they have had to make because of life 
threatening complications. It’s a horrific situation. Abortion is not a government issue
it’s an issue between people and their doctors not a government issue in anyway and 
certainly not in the last trimester unless a life threatening condition that is Dx by the 
doctors not the state government. You are killing an unborn child and that situation is 
not birth control issues. There are thousands of methods of birth control abortion is 
not one of them. ADOPTIONNIT ABORTION
