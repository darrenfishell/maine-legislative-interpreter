Micah Littlefield
Topsham
LD 1619
Senator Carney and representative Moonen & Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee,
 My name is Micah Littlefield, I am a Christian and a newly married man, I live in 
Topsham, and I am testifying in opposition to LD 1619. 
Please do not allow this dangerous bill to go any further. I will strongly stand against 
all abortion, including first, second, and certainly third trimester. Almost all babies in 
the third trimester are developed enough to survive, and grow into healthy citizens. 
Case in point,  the youngest baby ever born in Maine was recently delivered at 22 
weeks(still SECOND trimester),  and I'm sure has brought her family immense 
amounts of joy. I also know personally two young women who are twins, and were 
delivered very prematurely. They are 16 now, and are living full lives. 
I believe all abortion is murder, but right now I am pleading with you to draw the line,
and not allow full term abortion. Please do not legalize the poisoning, dismembering, 
and destroying of fully functional humans made in the image of God. Do not allow 
this abhorrent bill to go any further.
I urge all of you to defend the lives of the most innocent and vulnerable humans in 
Maine. Please vote Ought not to pass LD 1619.
