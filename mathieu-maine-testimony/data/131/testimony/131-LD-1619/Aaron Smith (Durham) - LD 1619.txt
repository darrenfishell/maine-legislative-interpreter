Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Aaron Smith and I am a resident of Durham and the father of ﬁve 
children. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Janet Mills has used the story of the Peirce family in Yarmouth and the suffering of 
their unborn baby from a rare form of skeletal dysplasia as a main reason why 
abortions should be made legal up to birth in Maine. This is rather ironic, arguing 
that the unborn baby needs to be put out of its suffering because of fetal pain from 
broken bones when no such consideration is given to fetal pain felt by babies 
during a 2"“ or 3"‘ trimester abortion. 
Dilation and Extraction (also known as a D and E) is a common abortion procedure 
for abortions done later in pregnancy. This involves extracting the baby in pieces 
from the uterus. The baby is literally ripped apart by metal forceps with no 
anesthesia given to it. It’s become apparent that fetal pain is something we need to 
consider in 2"“ and 3"‘ trimester abortions and if we care about the pain a fetus 
feels, shouldn’t we protect it from abortion procedures that would cause terrible 
pain? Doctors who provide fetal surgery are now recommending that the fetus 
receive anesthesia because it leads to less fetal distress and better outcomes. There 
should be more compassionate options than abortions for unborn babies who suffer 
from painful fatal conditions like the Peirce family’s baby. If we care about fetal 
pain and suffering, we need to care about it for all unborn babies who can feel 
pain, not just the one being used by the governor to argue for expanding abortions 
in Maine.
