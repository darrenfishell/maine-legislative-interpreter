LD 1619
Hello!  I am contacting you to ask you to oppose LD 1619.
This expansion of abortion would make Maine more extreme than states like New 
York and California and one of the most
extreme states in the country.
■ Abortion with no limitations, is dangerous and unethical. With no definition of what
constitutes necessity, no medical requirements, and no ethics test, there is no way to 
stop
any kind of abortion, even one because of race, sex, or disability.
■ Late term abortion is not “health care.”
