This proposed bill is mind-boggling. From a moral stance, it should not even be 
discussed—much less reach this point of a public hearing as to whether or not it 
should be legal to kill babies in the womb (at ANY time—for ANY REASON) but 
even to the point of birth. This sounds like a policy in the People’s Republic of 
China—not the United States of America and Maine, my adopted loved state for 35 
years. May I remind every person who reads this that YOU were once that baby in 
your mother’s womb. A person made in the image of God. 
Sadly, the moral issue will not hold sway for many. If this horrible bill passes, this 
legislature will make this beautiful state of Maine not “Vacationland” but “Abortion 
Land.” I beg you to THINK about the fact that this proposal kills innocent human 
beings and second, forever taints this beautiful state.
