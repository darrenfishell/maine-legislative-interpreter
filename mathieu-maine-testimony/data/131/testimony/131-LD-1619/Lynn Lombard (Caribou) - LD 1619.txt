Lynn Lombard
Caribou
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary, I am Lynn Lombard of Caribou, Maine.  I am here to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. When I read the
detail around this proposed law, I paused.  I thought about an infant, surviving outside
the womb, after a failed abortion attempt, and what happens next for that infant, the 
most helpless among us.  We've all heard the stories about infants left to die on 
storage room shelves, or whose organs are harvested and sold for, often, immense 
profit.  I was sick at heart considering what such a law would bring about in our state: 
the expansion of abortion allowed up to birth--as provided for in this bill--the abortion
of an infant typically able to live outside the womb, and the subsequent, in effect, 
murder--the intentional ending of a life--either through organ-harvesting, or by 
neglect, withholding needed care to an infant.  To deny life to the most innocent and 
vulnerable among us is simply abhorrent and unacceptable.  I implore you to vote in 
opposition to this bill.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
