Dorothy McLaughlin
Buxton 
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:  
My name is Dorothy "Linda" McLaughlin,  and I’m a resident of Buxton. I’m here to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619.
I am a retired nurse with thirty-one years in neonatal intensive care nursing and two 
years as a labor and delivery nurse.  Most of my professional career was devoted to 
saving babies that they now want to legally kill. This bill goes too far. I implore you 
to vote NO.  Vote NO to Maine being a destination state for late term abortions for 
out of staters. Maine is better than this!!   Please vote ought not to pass.
