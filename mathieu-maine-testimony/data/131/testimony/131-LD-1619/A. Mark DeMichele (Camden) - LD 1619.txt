A. Mark DeMichele
Camden
LD 1619
My name is A. Mark DeMichele and I have been a resident of Camden, Maine for 
more than 36 years. My wife and I moved to Maine when our children were both 
under 3 years old. Maine is a place of polite, hard working and caring people and a 
safe place to live and raise children. I am opposed to LD1619, which will permit 
extreme measures allowing abortions at any time up to the birth of the child. This bill 
would allow a baby that could potentially live outside of the womb to be killed. 
Maine law currently allows for medical necessities for cases that would endanger 
pregnant mothers. Abortion at any time for any reason is too extreme for Maine and 
would place our state among the minority of states that have no limits on abortion. 
Please oppose LD 1619 and stand up for the the unborn lives that cannot stand up for 
themselves.
Respectfully,
A. Mark DeMichele
