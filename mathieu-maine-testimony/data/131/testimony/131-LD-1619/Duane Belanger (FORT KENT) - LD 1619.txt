LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee,
I wish to submit written testimony in opposition to LD 1619 An Act to Improve 
Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws.  Terminating life at any stage is wrong.  
Terminating a life beyond the point of medically accepted viability is morally wrong 
and one only needs to examine MRSA Title 17-A ยง208-C: Elevated aggravated 
assault on pregnant person on one hand provides for an aggravating factor to be 
applied in the case of an assault which causes harm on a fetus and then goes on to 
provide for an exception for medical procedures in which the consent of the pregnant 
person, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf is obtained but it fails to 
discuss obtaining consent from the medically viable individual the aggravating factor 
is be being justified for!! If an act of the medical provider is causing harm and, in this 
case, intentional termination of life of the fetus who is reached a point of development
which the medical community and medical science determines make the fetus viable, 
can we morally and ethically proceed without obtaining the consent of this medically 
viable individual?  The ethical and moral consequences of this legislation are so grave
that I respectfully ask that you vote this bill out of committee "ought not to pass!"
Respectfully submitted,
Duane Belanger
118th Maine Legislature
