Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet Brackett, and I am a resident of New Sharon. I am 
unable to be present to testify in opposition to LD 1619, but I feel strongly that it is a bad bill: 
bad for women, bad for unborn babies (obviously), and bad for Maine. 
Many years ago, I gave birth to a child who was conceived out of wedlock. I was young, I was 
scared, and I didn’t know what I would do or how I would care for a child. My family was very 
unhappy with me.  I didn’t want to abort my baby, and by the grace of God I was able to give 
birth to a healthy child who has grown into a wonderful adult of whom I am very proud. I have 
never, even for a minute, regretted my decision to continue my pregnancy, even though my 
physician at the time urged me to abort so I could “get on with my life.” 
In contrast to my experience, two of my closest childhood friends, when faced with the same 
situation, chose abortion; one underwent multiple abortions over a period of several years. Both 
of these women eventually married and had children; both of them ultimately died too young 
from substance use disorder. I truly believe that my friends, once they became mothers, realized 
the terrible mistake they had made in aborting their babies and were unable to come to terms 
with their actions. These were NOT late term abortions, but knowing these women as I did, I 
have no doubt that the psychological aftermath of a late term abortion – chosen simply because 
the pregnancy was untimely –would have been even more devastating for them. 
Please do not pass this bill. Taking the life of a child who can survive outside the womb is not 
health care. Medical necessity is already covered in Maine law; allowing abortion at any time for 
any reason amounts to taking innocent life for NO reason. This is not who we are in Maine. 
Respectfully, 
Janet Brackett
