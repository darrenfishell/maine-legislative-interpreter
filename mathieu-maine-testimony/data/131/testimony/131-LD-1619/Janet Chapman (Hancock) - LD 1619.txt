Janet Chapman
Hancock
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Janet Chapman, and I’m a resident of Hancock. I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619.
My points are: you know you are pregnant at least by 2 months which is 8 weeks.  For
the health of the woman, choosing not to carry the child to birth should be decided by 
then. 
 
The right to choose is during sex.  Take precautions and take responsibility.  
If a woman decides at 16 weeks to abort due to medical reasons, that should be 
between the physician and her.  
Nobody who is not a doctor should be terminating pregnancy.  The health of a woman
is paramount in that situation and even a physician cannot guarantee the outcome.
If you have had children, you know the bond and the acceptance of responsibility that 
comes with conceiving a baby.  Psychological damage is a lifelong consideration.
We should have cheerleaders for women who choose to give birth.  It is a beautiful 
part of life and we need people to embrace that.I had my daughter at 40.  She was a 
surprise and the most important part of my life.
Please vote ought not to pass.
