Roan Weston
Corinth
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee of Judiciary, my name is Roan Weston and I am a resident of 
Corinth, Maine. I am here to testify in heavy opposition to LD 1619.
Abortion is murder, plain and simple. It is a wrong, sick, and evil practice. We have 
a Creator that made and loves all of us. He knows each and everybody's name years 
before they're born. Similarly, he knew the name of each and every aborted baby. He 
knew the accomplishments that they would make. He knew what each and every 
aspect of their life and personality would have been if they hadn't been brutally and 
mercilessly murdered.
Imagine the inventors, writers, musicians, and great minds that could have been 
born and thrived in our society. Everybody has potential, whether they have a disease 
at birth, deformities, or a debilitating condition. It is wrong to rid these potentially 
great people of their lives for any reason.
I understand that women can become pregnant against their will. However, that 
does not justify the murder of these babies. There is a reason we have pregnancy 
resource centers and adoption agencies. There are women who legitimately cannot 
care for their babies, but this doesn't mean they can abort them. There are thousands 
upon thousands of people who want children but can't have them due to various 
reasons. They would gladly and lovingly receive a baby for adoption instead of 
knowing a potential child was aborted.
Maine is a beautiful, wonderful state that should be known for preserving the 
sanctity of life. The abortion laws in Maine are already extreme now, but LD 1619 is 
going to make them even worse. The ability to murder a helpless baby at nine months 
inside the womb is an atrocious practice. Please oppose and reject this bill from 
coming into effect.
