LD 1619
I am opposed to LD 1619. This is wrong for Maine. Please consider what you are 
putting into law- consider the women who will suffer trauma and emotional issues. 
Consider the babies who won’t get their chance at life. Consider Maine and what this 
says about our state. This law is radical and evil. As a L&D nurse, I know this is 
wrong. Maine law already states abortion is legal up until 24 weeks (viability). If a 
woman cannot carry, or decides she doesn’t want her child beyond this point, then we 
have to look at what this late termination should be called. At this point of gestation, 
it is murder, it is termination of a life that is viable. Please, don’t take this lightly, this 
is so wrong on so many levels. These babies deserve life!! Maine is better than this . 
Let’s keep this state “Vacationland”, not “abortion destination land”. Find revenue 
other ways. And next work on making fostering and adopting children easier. If any 
of you reading this are persons of faith, know that God is clear in His word.
