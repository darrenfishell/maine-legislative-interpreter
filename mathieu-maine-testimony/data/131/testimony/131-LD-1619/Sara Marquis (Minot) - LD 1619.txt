LD 1619: An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws  
 
Oppose  
 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary 
Committee.  My name is  Sara Marquis  from Minot. I come before you today to 
speak in  opposition to LD 1619 – An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy 
Laws.  
 
It makes me sad that I have to come before you today to ensure that our state 
doesn’t murder our next generation .   I am here today to speak for human life and 
the most vulnerab le among us – the innocent, voiceless, most vulnerable, unborn 
child.  
 
There is no safer incubator of new human life than the natural womb of a mother.  
Every one of us here today came from the womb of our mother.  We should not 
take that for granted.  The y gave us our life.  And that is a tremendous gift.  Each 
one of us should thank our mother today.  Imagine if your life was taken from you 
and you had no say.  
 
The unborn baby in the womb has their own DNA that is separate and different 
from their mother.   To say that the decision to give birth to a viable unborn child is 
the decision of the woman and her doctor is to forget someone else.  That is the 
human life in the woman’s womb.  The woman is a mother, and her womb is 
sacred.  
 
This bill permits late -term abortion of viable unborn children right up to birth.  This 
is not an abortion.  This is infanticide.  This bill puts a moral stain on Maine .  It is 
barbaric.  I can’t believe I have to come before you and say this.   Please vote NO!
