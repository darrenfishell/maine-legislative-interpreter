Mechanic Falls
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Alyssa Morrison and I am a resident of
Mechanic Falls. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619. This bill promotes 
unnecessary and unethical abortion in the state of Maine. This bill does not protect 
women’s rights, it protects pro-abortionists and their desire to end life at any stage of 
pregnancy regardless of viability. This is no longer about science. Abortion is already 
such a gruesome and inhumane practice that, unfortunately, many people do not fully 
understand. To make them elective regardless of scientific viability is opening wide 
the doors to the genocide of our future generations in the guise of ‘women’s rights’. I,
as a woman, oppose this bill.
