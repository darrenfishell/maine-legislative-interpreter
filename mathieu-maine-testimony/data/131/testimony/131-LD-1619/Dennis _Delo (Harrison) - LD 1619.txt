LD 1619
Dear Mr. Chairman and Members of the Judiciary Committee:
I respectfully request that you vote "ought not to pass" on this bill, LD 1619, for the 
following reasons:
1. It is an Immoral proposal that denies a viable "Human Being" a right to life. 
2. It allows a "Physician" to decide the outcome of whether to allow a human being to
live or be eliminated- even up to the time of birth. In other words- there is no one to 
fight for the right of the unborn child to live and be allowed an opportunity to make 
this sick world a better place. 
3. There is no limit to the decision of when to pursue an abortion. Even after birth is 
"OKAY". WHAT? This I find very hard to believe. Abortion itself is bad enough. We
need to do better at the messaging. Adoption not abortion should be our goal. 
With all due respect, I hope and pray that you deny this bill the light of day and 
vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1619.
