LD 1619
Good evening, 
I am testifying against LD1619. As I understand this bill will allow abortion until 
birth. I am the mother of two children. When I was pregnant with our second child; 
we had many complications and at one point thought we had lost our daughter. After 
so much excitement and anticipation, it was a very scary time for our family. 
Thankfully everything turned out well. I have friends who were told to abort due to 
complications & seemingly hopeless situations, and now have healthy children. I am 
sure I am one of many citizens of Maine who do not support this bill. I pray you vote 
against LD1619. 
Sincerely,
Debra Briggs
