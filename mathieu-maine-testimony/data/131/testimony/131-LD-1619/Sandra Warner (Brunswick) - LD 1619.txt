Sandra Warner
Brunswick
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:  
My name is Sandra Warner, and I’m a resident of Brunswick. I’m writing to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
Please do not let the blood of even more innocent babies be on your hands.  One day 
we will all stand before a Holy and Just God and be accountable for our decisions.  To
further expand the abortion provisions already in place would be an egregious 
decision.  I implore you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1619.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and thank you for serving our beautiful 
State of Maine.
Please vote ought not to pass.
Respectfully,
Sandra Warner
Brunswick
