Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Dawn Carder and l am opposed to LD1619. “Life” is my reasoning for 
opposing this bill. A mother that carries her baby in her womb is carrying a precious life.l 
believe God created that life as it says in Psalm 139213, “For you created my inmost being; you 
knit me together in my mother’s womb.” it is also known that as early as 6 weeks in the womb 
the baby's heartbeat can be heard. 
To allow this extreme abortion at any time during a pregnancy all the way up to the time 
of birth for any reason is murdering our next generation of kids. Why is a mother’s right tor 
choose abortion more important than the baby’s life within her? We must take a stand and find 
more ways to save babies‘ lives, because their lives matter too! 
One last thing l would like to say is that if Maine chooses to allow this extreme biil to 
pass I believe it will only hurt Mainers in the end. if people come to “vacation land” for a iate 
term abortion then why would they want to come back to a place that reminded them of death. 
Lets choose today to save these babies‘ lives and give them a future. Let's provide the 
moms with hope and provisions for their needs. 
Thank you for taking the time to listen and hear our hearts. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
