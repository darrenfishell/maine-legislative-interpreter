LD 1619
To the members of the committee,
I am writing my testimony today because I am not in support of the proposed LD 
1619. My daughter was born three weeks prematurely due to labor induction and 
pre-clampsia that had become severe. She is now 12 years old and a child full of life, 
though she was a 4 lb baby when she was born. 
I am writing to stop this bill to save lives, the lives of these unborn children. There is 
no reason why a bill should be passed that would allow a baby to be killed, when they
could be a living and breathing child outside of the womb. 
Please consider stopping this unneccessary bill from going through.
