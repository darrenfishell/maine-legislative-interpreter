Rebecca Wirtes
Kennebunkport
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee , my name 
is Rebecca Wirtes and I am a resident of Kennebunkport. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
As a retired nurse,wife,mother,grandmother and great grandmother I value life from 
conception to death. In 1974,as a 19 year old nursing student in Boston, I found 
myself pregnant.The doctors immediate advise, “don’t go home this weekend, we 
need good nurses,we’ll take care of this problem!”  At 39 weeks, I delivered my son 
@ 5lbs. 12oz.and my daughter @ 5 lbs 11 oz.healthy twins! But according to the 
extreme nature of LD1619, the twins would have been killed, if I had decided I didn’t 
want this pregnancy??? I find this absolutely appalling!
My brother,sister, sister’s husband & their first born are ALL adopted. All these 
people wouldn’t be a part of my life , if their mothers had chosen to abort them as all 
these situations were unplanned and inconvenient. 
In my retirement,I volunteer@ a pregnancy center. I’m able to support & encourage 
parents, provide needed equipment, clothing ,diapers, and facilitate classes on Labor 
& Delivery , parenting skills & relationship issues.
There are other alternatives to abortion! 
What kind of people have we become that in one hospital room hundreds of 
thousands of dollars are spent to save the life of a “wanted” baby, and in the next 
room a baby is killed as viewed an inconvenience???
