LD 1619
 I am against abortion on demand once the fetus is determined to be viable and can 
survive outside of the mother's body.  We already allow late-term abortions in cases 
where the mother's life is at risk. There is no need to make it legal to end the life of a 
full-term viable baby for any reason.
 I am also deeply troubled about the section of this bill that allows non-medical people
to perform abortions without any training or licensure. Why would this be beneficial 
to women? I thought the whole point of legal abortion was that it makes the procedure
safer for women. Instead of do-it-yourself or back alley abortions, they are supposed 
to be performed by a trained medical professional in a facility equipped with 
life-saving devices.   I don't see how having people other than doctors perform them 
ensures the woman's safety.  Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1619.
