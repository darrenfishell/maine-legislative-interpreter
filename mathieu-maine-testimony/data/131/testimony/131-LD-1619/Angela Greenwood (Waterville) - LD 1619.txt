Senator Carney, Representative ivioonen, arse Honorable Mernbere of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Jttoioiaryt 
My narne is Angela Greenvvoortand t arn a reeiclerit of Watervilie. i arn 
testifying in opposition to LD i619, My oore values are that life begins at the 
rriornent of conception. Qur Qreator God designed our bodies that males and 
females may bring forth New Lite by oornbining a part of the woman vvitha 
part of the man. We know that engaging in sexual intercourse can, and may, 
lead to pregnancy ‘ This new lite is absolutely and awesomely unique to 
anyone elee, To intentionaliy end the development oi this new lite is murder. 
in Maine, we rnuroier an averege of ‘i4% of our new oitizene every year. 
Abortion ie the only action where it ie iegai to rnurder eorneone just because 
they are determined unwanted, This ie the htoet tinlovirig, intoierant, and non 
inoltteive thing that can be done; and it ie barbaric. Abortions performed after 
24;) vveeke gestation, when not done by inotiotiori of iabor (which leads to fetal 
death ooze to prematurity), ate rnoet oornrnonly oertorrned by dilation and 
evacuation (D & E) orooeoureetti] Theee oartiootiariy gruesome surgioai 
teohniouee involve oruahing, oiernernberrneht and removal of a fetai booy 
trotn a vvornarfs uterus, mere vveeite betore, or even after, the fetus reaohee a 
oeveioornental age oi poteritiai viahitity outeiee the mother.{2} in eorne oaaee, 
eeoeoiaily when the tetue ie beet the etage et viability, the abortion may 
involve adrnihietration of a iethai injection into the fetal heart in utero to 
ensure that the fetus ie not pulled out alive or with the ability to survive. LD 
1619 is titled "An Act to improve l\/laine ‘s Reproductive Privacy Laws" . How is 
increasing the opportunity to rnurcier nside the womb till the moment a baby 
is born in any vvay related to reproductive privacy iawe? This is an egregious 
bill. Fileaae vote LDi619 ought not to paeei Thank you for your time.
