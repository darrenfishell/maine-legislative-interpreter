Houlton
LD 1619
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee, My name is Diane DuBois. I am a 
resident of Houlton and a life long resident on the State of Maine. I am submitting this
email in opposition to the passage of LD1619.  In my lifetime I have been blessed 
with a kind and thoughtful daughter and two wonderful (now adult) grandchildren. 
My heart is heavy with the thought of the possible passage of LD1619. To me, late 
term abortion is the taking of an innocent life: lets not mince words killing/murder.  I, 
like 65% of Maine resident are opposed to the passage of LD1619 as later term 
abortion is gravely contrary to the value and dignity of a human life.  As adults, it is 
imperative that we respect and protect our children, who are unable to do so for 
themselves.  LD1619 is a total disregard of our most vunerable members of our 
society, our children. I urge the committee to please not deny the basic human rights 
to life of our Maine children.  I implore you to not let 65% of our Maine your 
residents and more importantly our innocent children down with the passage of LD 
1619.    Our unborn Maine children deserve a chance at life, just like we were all 
blessed to have had.  I wish you wisdom and discernment in making your final 
decision of LD1619 and opt NOT to pass this bill.  Thank you for your consideration 
in this vitally important issue.  Sincerely, Diane DuBois
