I support LD 1619  An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. I am a 
Registered Nurse, hold a va1id ME RN License and provided 43 years of nursing 
service to the Kennebec Valley Region. As a nurse, I took an Oath to maintain  
confidentiality regarding patient identification and care and must abide by HIPPA. I 
believe that the inalienable rights our country is founded on  Must  INCLUDE 
REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY as well as FREEDOM of REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.
ALL MAINE CITIZENS MUST HAVE REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY and an ACT  
to IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE  PRIVACY will help ensure such medical and 
personal privacy protection.   
Thank you. Kimberly Hallee 12 Gray Street Waterville ME 04901d personal
