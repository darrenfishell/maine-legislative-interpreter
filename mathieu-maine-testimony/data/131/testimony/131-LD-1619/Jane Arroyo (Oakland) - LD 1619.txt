Dear Committee members, As you know Maines state motto is, “I lead!”. And this is 
true! And we now have an opportunity to do just that, to lead the way. I want Maine 
to be known for all that is beautiful and strong, like it’s people. I moved here from 
Ohio 11 years ago and was immediately struck by the strength and determination of 
the people of Maine, and the absolute beauty of the land. Maine is known for these 
things! I believe that voting for life speaks of strength and beauty. That’s who the 
people of Maine are. That is why so many came to give their testimonies for life! So I 
strongly encourage you to do the same. Say no to LD1619. And stay in alignment 
with the purposes and greatness of Maine by voting for life. 
Thank you!
