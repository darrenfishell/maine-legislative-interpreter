Hi my name is Herb.  I am not here to argue but to show where I stand on the 
Reproductive Rights issue.  When my first wife and I found out we were expecting 
the doctors wanted us to have an abortion due to her Birth Defect of Spina Bifida.  
We were informed that either she could die during the pregnancy, or the baby could 
be born a vegetable.  We refused based on our religious convictions.   Each month we 
had ultrasounds and each month the doctors encouraged us to have an abortion.  We 
still took our stand, but the medical experts made it very hard with their opinions.  We
continued and during the pregnancy she was healthier and without pain for the first 
time in her life due to the position of the baby relieving pressure from her back.  
Other than picking gestational Diabetes she had no ill effects during the pregnancy. 
Our son was born 3 weeks early with no inherited birth defect and a completely 
healthy baby.  If we had given in and had the abortion our only son would not be here 
today.  
To God, every life has value and to just throw it away not only kills the babies but has
lasting affects the woman. She would have emotional scars that she will live with her 
for the rest of her life.
