Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
 
My name is Sharon R. Christie and I live in Caribou. I am testifying today in 
opposition of LD1619, An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws.   My 
husband and I are both pro-choice, but stand in absolute opposition, along with 
65% of other Mainers, to such late term abortions.  This is an extreme bill, 
allowing abortion up to birth itself. 
We like to say that life in Maine is ‘the way life should be’. We do not wish for our 
State to be known as a death state for unborn children.  Let us be known for life 
and unlimited opportunities. 
Again, abortion tourism is not the type of tourism that we desire for our State.  
Do not let your hand be held responsible for the deaths of our children, as you will 
certainly—one day—be held to account. 
Please oppose this unwanted, extreme bill that the majority of Mainers oppose. 
Thank you.
