Crystal Martell
Sanford, Maine
Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Crystal Martell and I am resident of Sanford Maine.
The U.S. Constitution and the current Maine law, Title 22, is stated or implied to 
protect and preserve life not to destroy it including protecting the life of the mother 
and baby.  God gave life, to abort life is murder.
Please vote no on LD 1619.     
Maine people love women including pregnant women and children.  I am asking that 
you would protect the women of this state by voting no on this extreme bill.
Also, Please vote no on LD 1343 and LD 776.
Maine people do not want a dictatorship/communist government.  Please do not create
hostility and allow perversion and abuse among its citizens including alteration and 
abuse to the individual person's body.
Hundreds or maybe 1000's of Maine people have spoken today, May 1, 2023, in 
opposition, please listen to us as your fellow citizens.
Please vote no not to pass on LD 1619, LD 1343, LD 776.
Thank you for your consideration.
