LD 1619
My name is Peter Ricker. I have lived in Maine my entire life. I strongly urge you to 
defeat the bill LD 1619. The fact that I can urge you, and that you can vote on this bill
is because life was chosen on your behalf. I believe this bill is an attack on the most 
vulnerable of society. I hope and pray that you choose what is right and what is moral.
Please vote to protect children. There lies in your hands a great responsibility . Thank 
you for your time.
