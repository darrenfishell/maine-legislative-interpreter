Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
Thank you for taking the time and thoughtful care to sit through hours of testimonies 
and letters; you were placed in the role you are in for such a time as this! 
My name is Kristin Elie from Minot Maine; I deeply oppose the proposed bill to 
extend abortion in Maine to full term. The sanctity and value of human life is too 
great to legalize being able to snuff it out when it can be  fully functioning. There are 
so many reasons why not to make this legal one of them being that we will be literally
killing the next generation of Mainers. 
I respect your time and know you have read so many letters but please, also consider 
that you not only making a legal decision but you are making moral decision that you 
will have to live with. Killing a child is dark and heavy weight. Please donâ€™t allow full
term abortion to be legal in our great state that I love so much. 
Sincerely, 
Kristin Elie
