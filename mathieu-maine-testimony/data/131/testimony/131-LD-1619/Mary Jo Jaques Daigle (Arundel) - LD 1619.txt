LD 1619
Good day members of the judiciary. 
I write to ask you to vote against LD1619. I believe This proposed legislation is 
barbaric and evil , with no possible outcome that is positive or beneficial.   Please 
consider why this legislation is being proposed— what parties will benefit- what 
parties will be exploited. 
Under LD1619, all abortions will be allowed in Maine, up to the ninth month- well 
past the time in pregnancy when a little baby can live outside its mom’s womb. The 
legislation also proposes removing language that states the reason for an abortion is 
for the life or health of the mother- it removes the requirement that a trained physician
perform the procedure and the requirement that the procedure be reported. So who 
profits from this legislation? Will the 8 and 9 month old baby  bodies be sold for 
profit to medical labs for research?  Will women suffer and die because the person 
operating on them is not qualified and does it in unsafely? Will you even know about 
it with no reporting requirement?The only beneficiary is the abortion business itself 
because they will expand their customer base , while removing regulatory oversight 
and reporting.   This is big business at its worst exploiting the most vulnerable among 
us, with the force of the state government behind it. Are we so callous? If you vote for
this legislation, you will please the governor, your political party perhaps and 
certainly planned parenthood. You vote against LD1619 and you can save a life. 
Maybe many lives. What more noble action is there on this planet than to save the life
of a fellow human being.
