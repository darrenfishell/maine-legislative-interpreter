Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Melanie Imes from Waterville. 
l am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
We, as a society pride ourselves on being educated and l believe we should use that education to the 
beneﬁt of all. A woman has several options should she choose to be sexually active and not want to 
have an unplanned pregnancy. Those options should be encouraged before the possibility ofan 
unplanned pregnancy. The medical ﬁeld has been very capable of presenting these options as safe and 
very effective. 
Should a woman become pregnant, God forbid, through a rape situation, or be concerned that she could 
be pregnant from another difﬁcult situation, there are options for this whether it be a DNC or day after 
pill, or another option of their choice in order to protect their future. 
The option to terminate a pregnancy up to 9 months is unthinkable when we have all these other 
options already at our disposal before the unplanned pregnancy happens. 
There was a promise made by Governor Mills while campaigning that she would not expand abortion 
and it is time for those who say things on the campaign trail to be held accountable regardless of the 
political pressure placed on them. Please vote in opposition to this bill and help Governor Mills rebuild 
trust for her word.
