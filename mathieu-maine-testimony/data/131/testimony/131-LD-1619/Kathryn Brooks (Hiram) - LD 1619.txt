Hiram
LD 1619
Madame/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judicial Committee:
My name is Kate Brooks and I am a resident of Hiram. I am writing to urge you not to
pass LD 1619. 
This bill is extreme and unnecessary. Maine's current laws related to abortion already 
account for medical necessity in cases of ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, etc. Governor 
Mills herself stated that Maine's laws are sufficient. By allowing late term abortion, 
infants born at 24 weeks or later (which is widely considered the age at which human 
life is viable outside the uterus) are not being granted the same basic human rights 
that adults are given in this country. Murder of anyone who has lived outside the 
womb is considered illegal: if that same infant could survive outside the womb 
without extreme measures, this bill would allow for the murder of an innocent life. 
Let me be clear: I consider myself pro-choice and am generally opposed to any 
legislation that takes away anyone's right to choose what's best for them. There is a 
caveat, however: I fervently believe everyone should be able to choose what's best for
them so long as they don't hurt anyone else or take what's not theirs. This belief is 
widely held by Libertarians, and is referred to as the non-aggression principle. It must
be the guiding light of governance in order to have a peaceful and prosperous society. 
If this bill passes, it indicates that our legislators are more inclined to support special 
interests rather than the larger good. Allowing for the killing of infants with impunity 
is depraved and is a hallmark of a sick society. I want better for us, and I want our 
elected officials to stand up and fight for the rights of all citizens. I want our elected 
officials to go with the 2/3 of Mainers who do not want this bill passed.
-Kate
