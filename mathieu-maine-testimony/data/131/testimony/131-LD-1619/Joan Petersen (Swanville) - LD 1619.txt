Hon. Chairs Carney and Moonen and Committee Members,
LD 1619 Ought Not To Pass
Acting as an Advocate for the Unborn Children of Maine,
I ask you not to pass LD 1619. These children who can feel pain and try to avoid 
dismemberment during the abortion process, if they had a vote, certainly would not 
vote yea for this bill. Neither are the fathers given a voice or choice in the process.  
This bill is beyond extreme and allows infanticide.  A state government is in place to 
protect its citizens, the aim of this bill is the antithesis of protection.  My thoughts are 
not outliers, as 
70% of Americans are opposed to late term abortion. As our representatives,  giving 
deep thought to the majority opinion should weigh heavily in your decision making 
process.
