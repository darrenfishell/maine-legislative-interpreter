LD1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws, LINDA HASKELL,
Testimony to oppose LD1619
We have laws in place to protect the mother when her life is in danger and the law 
also is for the benefit of a child or person in the case of rape. Killing needlessly is not 
the answer to this difficult decision. Birth control and abstinence
is the answer to a great many of these situations. Believe in the Lord and practice his 
word.
