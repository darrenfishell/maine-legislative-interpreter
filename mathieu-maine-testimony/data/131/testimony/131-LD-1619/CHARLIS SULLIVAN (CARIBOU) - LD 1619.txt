Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary. My name is Charlis Sullivan and I am here to testify in opposition 
 of LD 1619.  As a former educational administrator, I helped others to obtain jobs, high school 
diplomas and college degrees to help pave a better way for their lives. LD 1619 is 
counterintuitive to preserving and protecting the lives of the least of these. I know that a great 
many of you are concerned about freedom of choice and liberty, but a baby that can live 
outside the womb is completely deprived of its life and liberty with this unprecedented extreme 
bill. It is unfathomable that we should consider taking the life of a baby that is capable of 
sustaining life outside of the womb. This bill is dangerous and unethical! Shall we be the 
determiners of life and death? Is this not infanticide? The decision of this bill will be our legacy.  
I thoughtfully request that you reconsider this unconscionable and horrendous act. 
Thank you!
