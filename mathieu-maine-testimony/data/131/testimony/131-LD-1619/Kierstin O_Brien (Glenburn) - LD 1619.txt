Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciaiy, my name is Kierstin O'Brien and I am a resident of Glenburn. I am 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
My story is one that I think may be less heard here today, and I am privileged and blessed to 
share it with you. I'm here today as a survivor of abortion. Not in the way that my mother 
chose abortion and I survived the process, but rather in the way that my situation has always 
been a long-held acceptable reason for abortion. It was offered, encouraged, and acceptable 
for my mother to choose to end my life. She had not been a willing participant in my 
conception, so it was no fault of her own that landed her 18 and pregnant during her senior 
year of high school. I stand here today just as human, just as alive today as I was the day she 
discovered she was pregnant, carrying the same DNA now as I did then, and the same 
heartbeat now as I did then. I stand here today because she knew I had the same value then 
as I do now, just as every person here today has value, and she bravely chose life for me. 
Abortion rights in Maine already allow for medical necessity under current law. After the age of 
viability, there is no medical necessity for abortion to be an option. So, “performing an abortion 
after viability of the fetus when it was not necessary for the presen/ation of the life or health of 
the mother.” , as LD 1619 states, should be a non-issue. That individual human life inside the 
mother deserves as much protection and provision for life as the mother does. If the baby can 
survive outside the womb, it needs to be given the chance to do just that. If the mother can no 
longer medically carry the child, then the child should be delivered and fought for alongside the 
mother. That child deserves the chance. Just as each person here has been given that 
chance. Just as my mother bravely gave me that chance. 
Thank you for your time.
