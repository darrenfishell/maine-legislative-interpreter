Hello, my name is Ellen Brackley. I was born and raised here in Maine, and have 
lived here most of my life. My husband and I have three children, two girls and one 
boy, all older teenagers. My girls are twins, born prematurely at 29 weeks of age. 
Both girls had some complications, one more severe than the other. The doctors told 
us that she would not survive and if she did, she would have a very limited quality of 
life. We believed then and we believe now that regardless of whatever complications 
her disabilities might present to us as her parents, she deserved a right to life. Today, 
as an almost 17 year old young woman, she is a vibrant and beautiful member of not 
just our family, but our community as well. Her life impacts so many. In the words of 
her pediatric neurologist, after he released her from his care, "She's remarkable." All 
human beings deserve the right to live. Who are we to judge their worth based on 
what might be? In light of my own family's journey, I feel compelled to encourage 
you not to pass this extreme bill that will allow the lives of perfectly healthy, viable 
babies to be taken from them.
