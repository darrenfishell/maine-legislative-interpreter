Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Danielle Ogden and I reside in Pownal. 
Your role as representatives is to represent the will of all Mainers, those alive 
currently and those that could be conceived today. 
All Mainers have a right to life, a right to be born and have the freedom to live a life 
of his or her choosing. 
Science tells us that a unique life is created at the moment of conception. The only 
difference between my children when they were in my womb and the 5 year old, 2 
year old and 6 month old that surround me as I write this testimony today is the time 
they have had to develop and grow. 
As a woman who has been pregnant several times I can speak from experience when I
tell you how vulnerable a pregnant woman feels. I would encourage you to do 
everything in your power to help pregnant women bring life into the world. Giving 
mothers the option of choosing late term abortion will expose Maine women to 
unnecessary trauma as they deliver a dead baby that could have lived. 
Technology and science have greatly improved since 1973 when abortion was 
legalized. Now that we know better what the development of a baby looks like in 
utero we should do better.
Before you lays the power to choose good or evil, please follow the science and 
choose the good.
