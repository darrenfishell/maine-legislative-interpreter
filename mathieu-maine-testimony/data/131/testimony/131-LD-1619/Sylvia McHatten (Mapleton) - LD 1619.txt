I am writing to say how ashamed I am to be part of a country that believes it is alright 
to commit murder on a beautiful little child (full term) or less.  what should have 
never gone out of the doctor's office with a girl or woman.  If there was a good reason
(incest, rape, or health) t hen it should have been decided and kept in the doctor's 
office and certainly in the very early stages of pregnancy. Please add my name on the 
hopefully long list of those against this procedure. Thank you .  Mrs Sylvia McHatten
