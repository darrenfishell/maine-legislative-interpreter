Testimony Against Abortion 
Nancy L. Melcher 
28 Park Avenue 
Portland, Maine 04101 
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Nancy Melcher, and I am a native born Mainer who currently lives in Portland, Maine. 
In all of my sixty plus years on this earth, the one thing that I would redo, would be to carry my very 
ﬁrst child to full term. At seventeen, I had an abortion. Fear of the unknown was the driving force 
behind this decision. Had I known then, what I learned many years later, I would not have made that 
choice. This decision had a devastating impact on me and many others. Since then, I have been blessed 
with many children, including one that I gave up for adoption due to a number of extenuating 
circumstances. When abortion was suggested, I responded with a vehement “no”! Since that decision to 
carry that child to full term, and share the gift of that child with those who were unable to have their 
own children, I have never once felt a moment of regret. In addition to these personal experiences, two 
of my precious grandchildren had been diagnosed with “problems ”midterm, and abortion had been 
strongly suggested..Neve1theless, they are both healthy, vibrant children today as a result of their 
parent's decisions for life. I share all of this to implore each of you who hear this testimony to please 
oppose bill LD 1619 that would legalize abortion at all stages of a child's development in the womb. 
Thank you.
