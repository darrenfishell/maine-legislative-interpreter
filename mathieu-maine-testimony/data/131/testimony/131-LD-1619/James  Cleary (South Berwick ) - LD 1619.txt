Of those of us who were born in the age of Roe, all of us have the good fortune that 
we were chosen to be born.
Objectively, there's not much worse than a mother having a medically trained 
executioner violently murder her child with poison, then dismember the child and 
unceremoniously discard the pieces of the child as medical waste.
A born baby is not self-sufficient but has personhood. A baby that has not been born 
yet also is not self-sufficient but has personhood. Individual heartbeat, brain, 
fingerprints, and DNA are proof of this. As medical capacity advances, premature 
infants are viable at earlier and earlier stages, so there is no clear line to draw for 
when a healthy fetus is considered viable. Personally in your own development, how 
far back can you go before you were you? Were you not you when you were a couple 
weeks old in your mother's womb?
I believe the pro-abortion argument is founded on selfishness, facilitated by willing 
ignorance in the truth of what the act of abortion really is, and justified by medically 
sanitized language and claims against the oppression of women.
