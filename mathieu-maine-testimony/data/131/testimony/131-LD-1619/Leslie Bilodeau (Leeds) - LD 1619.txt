LD 1619
I am writing today to express my concern for LD-1619. I am a devout Catholic and 
truly believe that allowing women to obtain abortions throughout any state of 
pregnancy, especially up until birth will cause more harm then good. I believe that 
every life should be protected, especially the lives of the unborn as they cannot speak 
up for themselves. There are cases of rape, abuse, and incest when the option to put 
the baby up for adoption is available. There are many women who cannot conceive 
children of their own and adoption is their only choice. As for the times when the life 
of the mother is at risk, medical intervention is justified. I believe that choosing to 
have an abortion for the sole reason of not wanting a baby is nothing short of ending a
human life that does not deserve to be ended. Please consider the rights of all human 
life from the moment of conception and do not allow abortions at any or all stages of 
pregnancy.  Thank you
