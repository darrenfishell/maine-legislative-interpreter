LD 1619
DO NOT allow LD1619 to move forward.   Abortion on demand without limitations 
is dangerous and unethical.  It is worse than guns ownership without limitations.  
Regulations help keep people in line with respect and dignity for others.  Physicians 
may advocate for the mother to be, and they will advocate for the person paying the 
physicians fee, which is most likely the pregnant mother or her insurance, but there is 
no advocate for the unborn baby.  Unless the baby can have an advocate for equal 
justice and representation, this thought process of "guided by the women's physician" 
is flawed.  The unborn baby has his/her own DNA and is a person which needs equal 
representation before being aborted.  This is far from being healthcare.  It is one sided
legal care.  Healthcare heals.  Abortion care kills!
