Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Melanie denno, and I live in Athens. I’m not a mother or a wife, but I am 
a pro-life Mainer who has a little niece and nephew. And I’m writing this testimony to
do my part to speak up for life. 
To approve this bill would be barbaric and cowardly. It is murder no matter how you 
sugar coat it. Life is precious and given from God; we have no right to snuff it 
out—no matter the reason. The unborn did nothing to deserve death. They are 
helpless and in need of nurturing. Mothers and fathers are called to protect and care 
for their children, not throw them away when life gets hard. The thought that we are 
even considering this bill is revolving. Is this really the world we want to live in? One
that allows the murder of children? Children are a gift from the Lord. But some 
couples treat them like a consequence of their actions rather than a BLESSING. There
are better ways other than murder. 1st Choice Pregnancy is an organization who’s 
there to help mothers. They want to show mothers what a miracle their child is.
“Children are a gift from the LORD; they are a reward from him. Children born to a 
young man are like arrows in a warrior’s hands. How joyful is the man whose quiver 
is full of them!”
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want 
to see pass. Thank you.
