I am testifying again LD 1619
Allowing abortion at any point in a woman’s pregnancy for any reason does not heal 
and protect a woman, it kills a child.  If our goal is to allow create safety for women, 
all women, little girls (in the womb) need our protection as well.
Never does an act violence against another solve or heal the person who has 
experienced the violence.  However, acts of kindness and love often bring healing.  A 
life that has been created in an act of violence does not make that life void.  There are 
many cases of people who were conceived by rape and have led happy and productive
lives.  
Killing a child because there are birth defects is not merciful. It is more merciful for a 
child to  die being torn limb from limb or to die in the caring arms of someone ?
Women are often faced with difficult health issues during their pregnancy. Killing 
that women’s child intentionally has never saved the mother’s life.  There are times 
when the growing child dies because of medical intervention for the mother’s life.  
But that is far different than killing a child intentionally.
Abortion on demand is never needed.  Therefore I opposed LD 1619.
