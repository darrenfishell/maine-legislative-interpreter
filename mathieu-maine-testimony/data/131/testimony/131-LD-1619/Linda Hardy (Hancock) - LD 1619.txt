Linda Hardy
Hancock
LD 1619
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Linda Hardy and I live in Hancock, ME. I am a wife, mother of four adult
children and grandmother to ten grandchildren.
I am testifying today on LD 1619 because I cannot believe that we are arguing for the 
killing of a viable pre-born baby at the sole discretion of a doctor and mother. 
Is it not enough that in Maine it is legal to tear and cut an innocent living pre-born 
baby from it's mother's womb for any reason up to 24 weeks gestation? Now, this 
effort before us will say that two in agreement may kill, by dismemberment, or 
poison, another living human being who could be give a chance at life, to impact the 
lives of others with love, and joy.
I say that this life has already impacted the lives of others and that the deliberate 
killing of this child will profoundly affect the life of the mother, the doctor, the 
abortion assistive staff, the medical disposal people, the families involved and 
community at large.
The impact of this barbaric solution to a social, physical, mental, and emotional 
problem is destroying civilization. This is not compassion!
When Dr. C. Everett Koop was Surgeon General of the U.S., he claimed that in all the
years of his practice, he never saw a time when abortion was needed to save the life of
the mother. The medical community at that time saw the mother and pre-born child as
two patients and the practice was to save the life of both.
We have advanced in the practice of Maternal-Fetal Medicine so much that the only 
barrier to saving these babies is whether they are wanted or not.
This slippery slope of life determination puts each of our lives in grave danger.
Say NO to advancing abortion accessibility, loosening liability for abortion providers,
and diminishing protections for the vulnerable women, teens, and children of Maine.
