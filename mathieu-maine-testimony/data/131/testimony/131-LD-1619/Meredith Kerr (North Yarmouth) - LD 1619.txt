Vote No on LD 1619
It is 2053, thirty years after LD 1619 has been the law of Maine. There are untold 
numbers of children who could have been doctors, teachers, healthcare workers, 
governmental leaders, ministers, HVAC workers, inventors, authors, professors, 
mechanics, dads, moms (you name it) who are missing from our population. There are
untold numbers of women who remember when there was a life within them that they 
could have given birth to and provided or found a loving home for, but who are 
wondering what ifâ€¦.. Their grief is now manifest in many ways, but the hole in their 
heart is real and painful. 
How can we promote death to our most innocent ones and then wonder why we have 
a culture of death, shootings, chaos? Please be warned that passing this bill will be 
tragic for us and the next generation. Please vote no on LD 1619.
