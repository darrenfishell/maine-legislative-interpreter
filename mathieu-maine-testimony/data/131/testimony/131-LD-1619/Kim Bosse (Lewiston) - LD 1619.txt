Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee 
Thank you for being here today and listening to my testimony for opposing LD 1619. 
My name is Kim Bosse and l live in Lewiston. l am the grandmother of identical twin girls who 
were born alive and well at 28 weeks old, and they are still alive and well 11 years later. 
l don’t understand why the current abortion law in the state of Maine needs to be changed. 
If a baby is allowed to live in the mother’s womb for 24 weeks, the baby is considered to be 
viable. 
Viable means the baby can now live outside the mother’s womb. 
Aborting a viable baby is infanticide. 
lnfanticlde is the murder of an innocent, living, viable baby. 
This will happen if LD 1619 is passed. 
ls this what the people of Maine want? 
Thank you again for your attention to this important life issue. 
Pease vote NO for LD 1619. 
Sincerely, 
__/
