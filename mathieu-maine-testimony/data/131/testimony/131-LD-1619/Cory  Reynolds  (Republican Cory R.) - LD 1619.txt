Republican Cory R.
LD 1619
Good Afternoon, Sen. Anne Carney, Rep. Matt Moonen, and Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: My name is Cory Reynolds I am 
testifying in Opposition today for LD-1619 
Because it’s unconstitutional. Regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, 
Do you Believe in God? God is the only one who how we should be leaving this life. 
not a doctor choice to tell a a woman that they need to have an abortion. 
Abortion is wrong you are killing a kid. You are so worried about Gun Violence and 
want to take our guns away because it’s killing us, which isn’t it’s the person that is 
struggling with mental health and our state has failed us with. 
Maybe you should rethink about this bill. Again like I’ve said in most testimony’s I 
put in this isn’t about health of the Maine and American people this is about 
Government control, and it needs to stop. so I urge you to vote ought not to pass on 
LD-1619. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
