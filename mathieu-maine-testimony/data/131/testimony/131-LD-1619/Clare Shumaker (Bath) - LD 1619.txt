LD 1619
Honorable Members of the Maine Legislature:
LD 1619 will allow for an abortion right up to the birth of the child.  This is an 
abomination. If passed, this bill will cause us to regress hundreds if not thousands of 
years.  We would be implementing human sacrifice like ancient civilizations.  We 
would be bringing back to life the Nazi mindset during World War II.  It would 
legalize genocide and bring to mind the question, “Who is next?”
How can we advocate for stricter gun laws, drug laws, and environmental laws on one
hand and turn around and murder an innocent child, who cannot speak, on the other?
What does this say about us as a state? We can’t or don’t want to help figure out how 
to get someone out of crisis? In this day and age, THIS is the only alternative? 
Please, it is imperative that the Judiciary Committee vote, “Ought NOT to Pass” on 
LD 1619.
