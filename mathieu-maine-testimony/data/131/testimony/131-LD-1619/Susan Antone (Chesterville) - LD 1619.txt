Senator Carney and Representive Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Commitee on Judiciary, 
My name is Susan Antone. I am a resident of Chesterville. I am here today to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Women are designed by God to be a vessel, a vessel of honor, to carry human 
life. Sometimes it is inconvenient, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes 
difficult, to be that vessel. My husband and I had 8 children together. Seven 
of those children were born prematurely. They were born in late term, the 
period of time that this bill, if passed, would legalize abortion. 
Our first baby was born when I was 17, a senior in high school. To be 
pregnant at that time was extremely hard and difficult for me emotionally. It 
was life changing. She was born 8 weeks prematurely. I held her for a few 
minutes before she was put back into the incubator. She died 3 days later. 
Another baby was born 12 weeks early and died during birth. I am here today 
to honor the sanctity of life. 
Who am I to decide to end a life? I can’t fathom why, according to this bill, it 
would be legal to kill a baby during a late term pregnancy, but a crime after it 
is born. God says, “I have set before you life and death. Choose life.” Do not 
shorten the hand of God who can make a way when there seems no way and 
can make beauty from ashes. 
The people of our state work hard to protect children. I implore you to 
protect the children who are not yet born. I pray that the State of Maine 
would be a sanctuary for life - the life of the unborn child who has no voice 
and the life of the woman who is God’s vessel to carry life. Women are 
strong. Support the women who are carrying precious babies, by opposing 
late term abortion. Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
