LD 1619
I am strongly against this bill that would allow very late term abortions for any 
reason.
It shows no concern for the life or pain and suffering of the baby. 
Maine's current law is sufficient and no change is needed. 
Maine people do not support this and I would implore you to vote not to pass LD 
1619.
