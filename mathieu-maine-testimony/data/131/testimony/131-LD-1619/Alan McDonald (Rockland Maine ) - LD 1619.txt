To whom it may concern,
My name is Alan McDonald, husband and proud father of two wonderful boys (one of
whom is only a week old!) 
While I may not be a woman, and I have no idea the pains and trauma that pregnancy 
wreaks upon a woman’s body, what I DO know is that there is another that is also 
vulnerable-in addition to the woman…someone that everyone seems to forget about 
amidst the rights of the woman is the child no one is advocating for.  The child that 
did not ask to be conceived, and would very much like the chance to grow, and to be 
loved and cared for…
Why is it that we jump to the taking of a life so quickly?  Imagine if you will that we 
are speaking of a non-infant child for a moment. If an investigation were conducted 
and the child was not or could not be cared for would that child be put to death?  No, 
the child would have rights, and would be protected and ultimately moved to a family 
that could care for them!  So why is it that we aren’t putting in more measures to 
protect them at infancy? Are they any less a child? Any less deserving of protection 
and advocacy?  We find ourselves in the unique position to draw the line, and 
establish a better system that advocates for the care and support of these little ones 
(should their biological mother not be able to care for them).  There is no shame in 
asking for help, there is no shame in adoption or advocating for a child, but there is 
shame in murder.
To quote Dr. Suess (an author I enjoy reading to my children.) “A person is a person, 
no matter how small.”
I pray that this message finds its way to the heart of anyone reading it, and that this 
plight might be heard.  I pray that we might spare the lives of numerous children, and 
I pray that we might turn a new leaf in familial support, so this state can proudly 
declare “We take care of our own here.”
Please do not make this decision lightly, and please remember those not being 
advocated for….
