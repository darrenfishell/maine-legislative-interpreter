LD 1619
Honorable Members of the Judiciary,
My name is Rebecca Asselin-Emery and I live in Stockton Springs. I am submitting 
this testimony because I strongly oppose LD1619. I believe this proposed bill is much
too extreme and is unnecessary as we currently have a law that allows abortion to 
protect the health of the mother up to 24 weeks gestation. If this bill becomes law, I 
believe it will greatly impact not only viable healthy babies but also mothers and 
families. This bill is so extreme that precious innocent babies, viable babies that can 
survive outside of the womb, will experience great pain and suffering. More than that,
I believe the impact of this type of abortion on the Mother will be more devastating 
than is realized. 
This bill, if passed, would be one of the most extreme abortion laws in our country. 
This is not who we are in Maine, we value life, all life. We cannot let this bill become
law, this is NOT the way life should be. Please vote NO on LD 1619. Thank you for 
your time and service to our state.
