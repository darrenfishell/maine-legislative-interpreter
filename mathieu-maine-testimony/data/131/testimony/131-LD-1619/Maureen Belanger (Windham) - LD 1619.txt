I understand that everyone's circumstances are different.  I don't understand how late 
term abortions are less than murder.  There are mitigating circumstances that may 
require it but these should be rare exceptions in order to save the life of the mother, 
for example.  Please, let's not make Maine a place for people to come for their 
abortions.  That's not who we are.  Thank you.
