LD 1619 Hearing 
Speak Up For Life 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Joshua Peter Wilhelmi and I am a resident of Porter Maine. 
l am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I believe that it is morally wrong to take an innocent life that has no ability to speak for 
themselves. So l am here today to speak up for the babies in the bellies of mothers that this bill 
would allow to be terminated. l am here today to speak up for a generation yet to be conceived. 
The thought of destroying a human life at any stage of development saddens me, and the 
thought of killing a baby that is ready to come into the world and experience the wonders of life 
horrifies me. l am the stepfather of a young man with special needs and was born prematurely 
at 34 â€˜A weeks. He is a blessing and an inspiration to my life. God forbid his mother would have 
given up on him. 
I believe that LD 1619 is extreme and that current abortion laws in Maine already allow for any 
medical contingencies. So for all practical purposes this bill is unnecessary and wrong for 
Maine. 
l would want people to come to Maine to see the natural beauty of the beaches, lakes and 
mountains, the historic lighthouses, forts and villages. Not to come here to abort an innocent life 
that has the potential to love, laugh and to live. So l would urge you to vote against LD 1619 and 
the other bills proposed with it. 
Thank you for your time and for the opportunity to speak at this hearing.
