Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Margaret Munsell, and I’m a resident of Casco, Maine. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
As a pregnant mother, a First Wave feminist, a friend of individuals who have had 
abortions, a woman, and a person of faith, I cannot in good conscience support this bill. 
This bill enables and empowers continued hostility and violence against and on women 
in the name of empowerment. Abortion is a violation of women and their bodies, and 
leads to pain and suffering in every case I have encountered. I have family members 
who were told by medical providers that abortion was their only option, who still grieve 
for their unborn children. 
As a society we repeatedly tell women that in order to “get ahead” and achieve parity 
with males they need to sacrifice their reproductive rights in order to achieve their goals, 
with little or no acknowledgement of their unique strengths and abilities. 
As a trauma therapist, I explore unresolved grief and pain on a day-to-day basis. This 
law enables and empowers society to continue traumatizing and targeting women in 
unspeakable, unfathomable, unconscionable ways, all under the guise of equity. 
I beg of you to stand up against this continued oppression, and empower women to 
embrace what makes them uniquely feminine in a world where being a woman isa 
confusing, challenging, and often dangerous endeavor. Please vote that LD 1619 ought 
not to pass. 
Thank you so much, 
Margaret Munsell
