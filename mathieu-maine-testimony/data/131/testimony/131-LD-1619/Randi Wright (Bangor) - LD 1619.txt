RE: Bill LD1619 
 
Dear Committee,  
 
My name is Randi Wright from Bangor Maine. I am a mom to 6 children, 3 of those children live 
in my home with my husband and I. Two of them I lost to miscarriage, and one our baby boy 
Malachi was stillborn 3 days after Christmas in 2016. I held his lifeless body in my arms, I cried 
over this life that I was planning for but was taken too soon.  A lifetime of dreams for this little 
boy gone in just a few hours. This was not my choice. His LIFE began the day he was conceived 
and his life, although not outside the womb has had much impact on friends, family, and 
strangers as I am able to offer hope to the grieving parent. To take the life of a baby in the 
womb is not for us to decide. Who are we to decide that this childâ€™s life is not worth living? 
Who are we to decide that it would be too much for the mother? This is not a choice for us to 
make. Each child is a life with a purpose, just as much as each one of you were born with 
purpose. Not to needlessly kill, but uphold the law, and protect its people. These children are 
your people. I strongly ask you to say NO to passing Bill LD1619.  
 
Sincerely, 
Randi Wright
