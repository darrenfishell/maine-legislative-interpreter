Lewiston
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Eliza Jacques. I am a resident of 
Lewiston and I oppose LD 1619.
I am testifying to address my concerns with this bill and how it will negatively impact
Maine residents, especially women and children. This unnecessary and extreme bill 
proposes to allow an abortion to be performed when it is considered necessary by a 
physician without a limit on the gestational age of the baby. My own son was born a 
week early, at 39 weeks gestation, and he was very much a fully formed human with 
the right to life just as he was when he was in my womb. However, according to this 
proposed bill, he would have been a candidate for abortion. Life is the foundation of 
all other rights, and as representatives for the people of Maine, your job is to protect 
our rights, which includes those of the unborn, arguably the most vulnerable in our 
community. 
Furthermore, the future of our beautiful state of Maine is undeniably at risk. It is well 
known that one third of our states population is sixty and older, which is remarkably 
the oldest in the nation. Our state's birth rate is one of the lowest in the nation, as well.
We must take into consideration how LD 1619 could impact our future population, 
and potentially cause labor shortages and economic issues alike. 
LD 1619 is not for Maine. Please oppose this drastic bill for your future Mainers. 
Thank you.
