Testimony of Phyllis Johnston
Oppose LD 1619
An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, my name is Phyllis Johnston and I oppose 
LD 1619.  I live in Carmel, Maine.  Thank you for the opportunity to address the 
Committee.
I oppose LD 1619 because I believe that expanding abortion access to the moment of 
birth should not be legalized.  It’s simply the ending of a viable life which I believe is 
morally wrong.   I also believe that penalties for individuals who perform 
“back-alley” abortions should not be decreased.
  I respectfully request that you oppose LD 1619.
