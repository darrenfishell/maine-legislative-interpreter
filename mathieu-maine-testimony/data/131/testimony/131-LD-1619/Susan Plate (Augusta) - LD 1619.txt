LD 1619
I am strongly opposed to passing LD 1619 allowing for late term abortion. Our 
federal constitution provides for the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
for every individual. An unborn child should be protected and defended under this 
principle. Parents do not have the right to kill a child the day after it is born, nor 
should they the day before it is born. Common sense, reason and respect for life need 
to prevail. There must be a different approach to solving the problem of an unwanted 
pregnancy other than butchering, chemically burning and wrenching a developing 
child from the natural incubator of its mother's womb. That is barbaric and inhumane. 
Please let Maine stand for life and the potential of every human being!
