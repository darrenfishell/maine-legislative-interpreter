Cynthia Tillson
Poland
LD 1619
 Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Cynthia Tillson and I'm a resident of 
Poland.
 "Maine the way life should be" is our state motto but today our lawmakers, who we 
elect to represent our voice, are considering a bill, LD1619, that would allow the 
killing of unborn children until birth. They don't have a voice so I'm using mine on 
their behalf. 60% of Maine citizens do not agree with this bill, pro-life and pro-choice,
it is too extreme.
 I believe life begins at conception, every life is a gift from God, and every person has
value. 
 The Bible says in Psalm 139: 13-14 : "... You created my inmost being, you knit me 
together in my mother's womb, I will give thanks to you for I am fearfully and 
wonderfully made."
 I ask you to consider also the long term psychological, emotional, and physical harm,
including death of the mother. there is a chance she may not be able to conceive, if 
and when she chooses to in the future. This risk increases the later in her pregnancy 
she chooses to have an abortion.
 Booker T. Washington stated: " A lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become 
right, and evil doesn't become good just because it's accepted by a majority."
 Do we want Maine to become a vacation destination where women come to end the 
life of their unborn children or remain Vacationland where they bring their children to
enjoy all our beautiful state has to offer...mountains, lakes, rivers, and breathtaking 
coast?
 "Behold, children are a gift of the Lord, the fruit of the womb is a reward. Like 
arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. How blessed is the 
man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be ashamed when they speak with 
their enemies at the gate, " Psalm 127: 3-5
 Our children are our future. I pray your hearts will be softened, you will do the right 
thing, and vote "ought not to pass" on LD 1619.
 Thank you
