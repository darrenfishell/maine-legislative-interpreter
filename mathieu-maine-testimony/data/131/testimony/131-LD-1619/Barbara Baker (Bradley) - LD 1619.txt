Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a procedure to remove tissue from inside your uterus.
Health care providers perform dilation and curettage to diagnose and treat certain 
uterine conditions — such as heavy bleeding — or to clear the uterine lining after a 
miscarriage or abortion.
Any woman having a miscarriage after 10 weeks is likely to need such a procedure to 
remove tissue that remains afterward. It is up to the physician to do this procedure, yet
other states are stopping or calling into question the lawfulness of it. Maine needs this
bill to pass, so that couples who have tried to conceive multiple time, yet continue to 
have miscarriages can get the necessary healthcare as followup to such miscarriages 
at any stage in which this happens. The trauma of a miscarriage is enough without 
complicating healthcare procedures with unneeded laws stigmatizing a procedure so 
much that doctors are afraid to perform it or can be criminalized for it. Whether a D &
C is performed for an abortion or for a miscarriage it is healthcare and should be 
available as needed between a physician and a woman. Please pass LD 1619.
