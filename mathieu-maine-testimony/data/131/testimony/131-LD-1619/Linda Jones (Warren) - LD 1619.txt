Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Linda Jones, and I have lived in Maine since I was 11 years old. I am here today to strongly oppose 
this LD1619. This bill is not what "We the People” in Maine want for our great State! This bill is extreme and takes 
Maine into a place where it shows we have no regard for human life or what a blessing it is to protect the sacred 
womb, to honor life and the unborn child. This bill is barbaric and moves our State into a very questionable, dark, 
unmoral and faithless place. I believe that most people who live in our State do not agree with late term abortions, 
anywhere and anytime! This horriﬁc bill is taking a life of the unborn child at a point where they can live outside the 
womb, and this legislation even decreases penalties for individuals who perform "back alley" abortions and takes us 
back years to endangering the Mother as well as killing babies! 
l urge you to Kill this Bill, not the unborn children and show you CARE for life and are willing to stand up against 
this terrible injustice for the lives of the unborn! 
Please vote ought not to pass LD 1619. 
Sincerely, 
Linda S. Jones
