LD 1619
I am not in favor of   LD 1619 becoming the law of Maine. It is clearly not a good law
for some yet unknown  babies awaiting their turn to see the light of day. I believe it is 
also not good for this beingâ€™s parents, siblings, grandparents, community, etc. It is not
a good action for this legislative body to allow anyone to take life and liberty from 
those about to begin the adventure of feeling the sun on their faces, milk in their 
mouths, etc. Have mercy!
