Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony. 
Each person defines the existence of life differently. Some people believe life does 
not start until a baby is delivered from it's mother. Other people believe it starts at the 
point of conception. However, science recognizes the existence of life as any system 
capable of performing functions such as eating, metabolizing, excreting, breathing, 
moving, growing, reproducing, and responding to external stimuli. 
The dictionary defines life as an organismic state characterized by capacity for 
metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.
These are all characteristics of a fetus. The real debate is over when the fetus has 
these characteristics. I believe it is well before birth and passing a law that allows for 
reproductive privacy would lead to late term abortions. 
Also, I believe passing the proposed law into affect would violate our murder law as 
seen below:
ยง1111. Murder
(a) Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Every 
murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, 
malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to 
perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, 
aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or 
perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or 
children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to 
effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first
degree.
