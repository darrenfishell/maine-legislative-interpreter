My name is michaeleighna McDonald and I am writing to the judiciary committee 
and governor mills of Maine to say I DO NOT want this bill passed that legalizes late 
term abortion. I do not want any bill passed that legalizes ANY abortion at ANY time 
in the natal development of a child. If the state of Maine wants to help women in 
crisis during pregnancy then you need to support and uplift pregnancy crisis centers 
such as ZOE of Rockport Maine, previously known as Care Net. The state needs to 
utilize this resource that helps women bring life into the world without the assumption
that she will care for the child. Centers like Zoe offer help with adoption, housing, 
food and more to young mothers. I see NO REASON at all to legalize ending the life 
of a child because of the burden it may bring upon the mother when we have 
resources to the contrary. I DO NOT WANT THIS BILL THAT LEGALIZES LATE 
TERM ABORTION TO BE PASSED. Thank you for your time.
