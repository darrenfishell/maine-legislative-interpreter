LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maineâ€™s Reproductive Privacy Laws
This proposal runs counter to the most basic principles of freedom in our country. 
Everyone has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - this includes those 
who are pre-born. The murder of children in utero ought to be a crime punished by 
law. Neither science nor philosophy has been able to identify a clear marker that 
would separate a fetus in utero from a child who has been born. Therefore they have 
the same rights as any citizens outside of the womb. It is our duty to protect these 
little ones who cannot defend themselves. Please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
