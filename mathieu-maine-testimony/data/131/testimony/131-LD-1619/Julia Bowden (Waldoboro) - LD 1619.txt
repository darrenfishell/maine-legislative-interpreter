Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Julia Bowden and I am a resident of 
Waldoboro. I am testifying in opposition to LD 1619.  
I am opposed to LD 1619 because I believe that every life has meaning and is 
meant to bring something important into this world. I believe that this bill is wrong 
for Maine because everyone has the God-given right to life. These are children who 
could survive outside of the womb, who can feel pain. How could we as humans be 
a part to the mass genocide, we call abortion? I believe in the right to life no matter 
what age, economic status, mental capacity, disability, or whatever circumstances 
you may have. Our life circumstances shouldn’t define our worth. And no one on this 
earth should have the authority to choose who lives and who dies based on their 
circumstances. Everyone should be entitled to life; not something you have to earn 
the right to otherwise none of us would be here today. 
This is important to me because I was once a baby too, Jesus was a baby, you 
were a baby, and anyone who stands on this earth today was a baby at one point. It 
is my belief that babies are a blessing from God. Imagine looking your child in their 
eyes today and telling them that they are too much of a burden. Telling them that 
everyone would be better off if they were dead. Now if you couldn’t tell that to your 
child at age 5, 15, 23, or 30 then how could you tell that to a baby? I pray that you 
decide to stand up for these babies and their right to life by voting not to pass LD 
1619.
