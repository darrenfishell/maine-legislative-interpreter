LD 1619
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 1619.  We do not want unlimited abortion in Maine.  This 
would make us one of the most extreme states on abortion laws in our nation.  This is 
a disgrace and is not what is best for women or the pre-born who also have a right to 
live.  
Please vote OUGHT NOT to pass on LD 1619
Thank you, Elizabeth G. Homchuck (Guilford)
