Senator Carney. Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Marie Keene andI 
reside in Swanville. I am here testifying in opposition to LD 1619 a bill 
that would allow abortion up to birth. 
Today I, SPEAK UP FOR LIFE, for the babies who can't. LD1619 is 
EXTREME and a bill that I (as a Maine native) and many others that are 
here today do not want in our great State where people come to enjoy 
life not take it. Please don't allow Maine to join those few state who 
have passed such laws. 
All murder is wrong but especially of innocent babies who can't defend 
themselves. I am Pro-Life, I am catholic and I oppose this bill._ 
I am asking you today to please vote NO on LD1619 a bill that will allow 
for abortion, killing, murder of a full term baby, a baby that could 
survive outside of the womb, given the chance. 
Please look deep inside yourselves and make the right decision. 
Vote NO. 
Thank you.
