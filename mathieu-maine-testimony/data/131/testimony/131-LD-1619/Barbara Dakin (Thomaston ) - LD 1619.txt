LD 1619
I am respectfully asking you to oppose LD 1619 - allowing abortions full term up to 
the point of birth to not be passed.  Please do not allow this to become the law of the 
State of Maine.  As a civilized people we must compassionately protect the life of all, 
especially the weakest among us.  This law is barbaric and will lead to the further 
disintegration of our state and nation. 
Please do all you can to keep Maine free and safe for our citizens of all ages.
Thank you.
