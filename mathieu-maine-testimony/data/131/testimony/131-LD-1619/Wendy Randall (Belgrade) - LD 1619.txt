LD 1619
To members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary Regarding  LD 1619, 
thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony. My name is Wendy Randall 
and I am a citizen and tax payer of Belgrade, Maine. I am vehemently opposed to 
LD1619.  If this bill was to pass, Maine would have one of the most extreme abortion 
laws in the country. This bill would allow a baby that could be survived outside of the
womb to be killed. Since medical necessity it covered by the current law, there is 
absolutely no need for this. As a Christian, I believe life begins at conception and 
every life is a gift from God. I would appreciate you doing everything in your power 
to oppose this legislation.
