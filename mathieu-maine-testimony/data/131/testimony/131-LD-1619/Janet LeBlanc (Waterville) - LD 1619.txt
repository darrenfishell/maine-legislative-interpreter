Janet LeBlanc
Waterville
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am  testifing in opposition to LD 1619.   I also encourage you to oppose 
LD 776 and LD 1343.
First, it is important to remember the Dobbs' decision didn’t change anything in 
Maine.  All of our laws allowing abortion remain in place.
Secondly, Current Maine abortion law doesn’t concern itself with the safety of the 
mother.   LD 1619   will add to the neglect of safety of the mother in regards to 
abortion. Not requiring provides to have admitting privileges at a hospital, in case 
something goes wrong during the abortion is one of the way Maine law ignores the 
safety of the mother in regards to abortion.  Having access to mail-order chemical 
abortions without seeing a medical provider is another way Maine law ignores the 
safety of the mother in regards to abortion.  This lack of concern for the mother 
doesn't treat abortion as healthcare. 
This bill will remove serious penalties for an unlicensed person who provides an 
illegal “back alley” abortion, and eliminates criminal penalties for licensed providers, 
who perform surgical abortions after the viability.  This will undercut the law and 
provide tacit approval of people performing abortions illegally.  This bill will add to 
Maine not caring for the safety of the mother regarding abortion.  By removing the 
penalties for unlicensed people to provide surgical abortion it will further 
acknowledge that abortion isn’t healthcare.  To my knowledge all other surgical 
procedures in Maine required the person performing the surgery to be licensed in 
Maine. 
Maine law should concern itself with the safety of the mother who is seeking an 
abortion.  LD 1619 should not pass because it puts the mother’s life at risk by 
removing penalties for an unlicensed person for performing a surgical abortion.
