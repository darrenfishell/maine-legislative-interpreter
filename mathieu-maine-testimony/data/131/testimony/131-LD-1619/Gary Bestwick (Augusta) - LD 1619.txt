LD 1619
I believe LD 1619 ought not to pass for the following reasons:
 The Declaration of Independence stated that Life is an inalienable right given to us 
by our Creator. 
The United States Constitution went to on to say that noone should be deprived of that
right without 
due process of law.
 The question arises: At what point does human life begin? Science tells us that at the 
moment of 
conception a new organism with distinct DNA from its mother exists inside the 
mother.
 Doctors exist for the express purpose of saving lives and keeping living persons 
healthy. However,
sometimes a doctor faces an agonizing decision. He can save a mother, or the child, 
but not both. That 
decision may be made with input from the patient's family, but certainly the 
government should not 
have a voice.
 Viability is understood to be the moment at which the child can survive outside the 
womb. At that 
moment, the relieved doctor can say, “Hooray, I can save both!”
 Today, we also have Assisted Viability. With the assistance of Neonatal Healthcare, 
a premature 
infant may live at a much younger age than in the past.
 My elected representative informed me that one reason for this bill is that a woman 
whose child 
could not survive had to travel out of state to obtain an abortion. Perhaps a narrow 
exception could 
have been written into the law for that situation. This bill is too ambiguous. It allows 
for unlimited 
abortions after viability if a doctor can be found who will approve them.
 I want to end my remarks with a poetic thought. As I listened to the heavy rain this 
morning, I 
thought to myself, “God is shedding tears over the children of Maine who will be 
deprived of life 
because of this law.
