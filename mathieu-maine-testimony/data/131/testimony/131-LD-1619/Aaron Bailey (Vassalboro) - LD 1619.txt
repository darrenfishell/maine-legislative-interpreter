We are in shock and awe when we hear about a school shooting.  When we hear of 
defenseless children and teachers being slaughtered light sitting ducks we are 
appalled.  If we truly want to save lives of the innocent, why don't we stop abortion?  
We should be shocked and appalled when we hear that in 2011, there were over a 
million unborn babies killed in the United States of America (according to 
Guttmacher Institute).  A nation that was built upon Judeo Christian values.  Though 
shalt not murder God commanded.  Let it be known that Christians do not stand with 
those who call for so called abortion rights.  We will not stand idly by while you are 
killing our neighbors (Leviticus 19:16)  
God alone is the only one who was meant to have the power to decide when we live 
and when we die.  Deuteronomy 32:39 says in part, "...there is no God besides Me; I 
kill and I make alive."  When you kill babies you are playing God.  Do you really 
want to be judged for that when you stand before Christ, the righteous judge some 
day?  
 For we must all stand before Christ to be judged. We will each receive whatever we 
deserve for the good or evil we have done in this earthly body.  2 Corinthians 5:10
Please reject this evil LD.  LD 1619.
