LD 1619
LD 1619, also known as "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws," is 
a bill that seeks to expand access to abortion services in Maine. While the proponents 
of this bill argue that it is necessary to protect women's reproductive rights, it ignores 
the moral and ethical concerns surrounding abortion. The bill fails to recognize the 
rights of the unborn child and disregards the potential harm that abortion can cause to 
both the mother and child.  Finally, the bill ignores the fact that many Maine residents
hold deeply held beliefs regarding the sanctity of life and do not want to be forced to 
support abortion through their tax dollars. For these reasons, LD 1619 should not be 
passed into law. 
I have been a resident of the State of Maine for 59 years, if LD 1619 passes, I would 
have no other choice but to leave the State of Maine.
Please do the right thing and protect the lives of the unborn.
Thank you!
