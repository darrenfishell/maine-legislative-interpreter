LD 1619
I am prolife from conception to natural death. Science research has proven that a fetus
born alive as early at 22 weeks gestation can survive and thrive with medical 
intervention. The Sun Journal newspaper recently published a detailed news article 
about such a baby born in Maine.
I am against LD 1619, which is in my opinion another way of condoning infantiside.
