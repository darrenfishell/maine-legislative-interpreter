LD 1619
As a Christian minister (now honorary retired), father, and grandfather, I strongly 
support LD 1619, which will improve Maine's current public policy by allowing 
women, in consultation with their physician, to terminate a post-viability pregnancy 
whether or not the woman's life and/or health may be at risk.  These tender decisions, 
which typically arise only in the most tragic and saddest of circumstances, should be 
made by the immediate individuals involved along with those they trust and turn to 
for guidance and support.  As a chaplain, I have sat with, prayed with, and supported 
women who have wrestled with these matters and done so with the utmost care, moral
integrity, and deep compassion for themselves and others.  Although we might all 
wish that problematic pregnancies did not occur, the reality is that they do, so we 
should design our public policy in ways that do not add burdens at such a difficult 
time to women, their families, or their health care providers.  Our guiding moral 
principles should be twofold: first, to do no harm by placing unnecessary restrictions 
on women and their physicians, and, second, to trust women to do the best they can, 
often under less than optimal circumstances.  LD 1619 is good and principled 
legislation that honors both these principles and, in my judgment, ought to be passed.
