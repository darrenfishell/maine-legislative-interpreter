Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Sandra OBrien and I live in Falmouth.  I am a mother and grandmother.  
My personal experience with abortion laws occurred many years ago when my then 
teenage sister became pregnant.  The laws where we lived would not allow her an 
abortion and she had no transportation to a different state.  Thank God!  If late term 
abortions had been allowed, my niece might never had been born.  
My understanding is that in Maine, abortions that are a medical necessity are covered 
by law.
I do not understand why when a baby is at a stage of development within the womb, 
that it can survive outside the womb, it should not be protected to have that chance at 
life.  Why should a mother be able to choose to prevent her baby from having the 
chance at life ?  
Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill.  Thank you.
