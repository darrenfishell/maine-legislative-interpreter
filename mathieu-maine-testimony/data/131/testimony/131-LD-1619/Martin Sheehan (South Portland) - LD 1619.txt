An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws 
LD 1619 Position:Oppose 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of Maine’s 
Judiciary Committee and fellow Citizens of Maine: My name is Martin 
Sheehan of South Portland. l am not a politician, am not enrolled in 
any political party and have been retired for 13 years. l would like to 
make a few points in opposition to this deceptively named proposal. 
Abortion has been one of the hottest political issues since l was in 
Junior High. One thing l’ve always noticed about this issue is that the 
people who want Abortion expanded — available everywhere, to 
anyone at any time of a pregnancy — rarely say the word “Abortion. ” 
lt’s sanitized as “Privacy, ” “Choice,” “Healthcare, ” “Women’s Rights,” 
“Bodily Autonomy, ” or “Reproductive Freedom. ” But it’s not 
reproductive. lt’s counter-productive. lt’s destructive. lt’s the opposite 
of Health Care. 
People who are opposed to Abortion do say the word when the issue is 
discussed. lt’s an ugly word. lt should be an ugly word because it 
ends a human life. 
lt’s no surprise that people promoting Abortion don’t want to talk about 
what it really is. They don’t want others to talk about it either. 
l believe that a more honest and descriptive title for LD1619 would be: 
“An Act to Promote and Provide Abortions for Any Woman, Any 
Time During a Pregnancy, with No Limitations or Questions 
Whatsoever. ” 
l urge the Committee to vote NO on this bill, and work towards the goal 
of President Clinton: and make Abortion “Safe, Legal... and Rare.” 
Thank you
