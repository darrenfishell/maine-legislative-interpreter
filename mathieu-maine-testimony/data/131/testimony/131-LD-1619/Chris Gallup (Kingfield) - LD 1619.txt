LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
My name is Chris Gallup, and I’m a resident of Kingfield.  I am testifying in 
opposition to LD 1619.
I am in opposition to this bill since it will allow for an abortion up to birth.  The 
procedure to terminate the life of the fetus, and then extract it from the mother’s 
womb, is brutal and inhumane.  Is this what you want the legacy of the Judiciary 
Committee to be?  Also, over 65% of Mainers don’t want late-term abortions.
Please vote ought not to pass.
Thank you.
Chris Gallup
Kingfield
