LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary.
My name is Chandra Bewell. I am a resident of Bremen, Maine I am speaking to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619.
My Mom was a young mother when I was born. I am so grateful that she chose life!
The right to life triumphs over someone’s reproductive rights. We have no right to 
take another’s life.
By killing our children we are also hurting Maine’s economy. Maine won’t function 
well without enough young people to take the place in employment as our older 
population retires. We need their gifts and their contributions.
Beyond that, these boys and girls have intrinsic value by virtue of being human 
beings, including those who are unable to contribute to society in the same way that 
others can.
It so happens that some parents don’t feel able to raise children. Adoption or support 
for parents are viable options.
Each life matters! I urge you to vote against LD 1619. Maine needs to be a 
child-friendly place, not a place of danger for our youngest ones.
Someone guarded, protected and provided for each one of you. Now it is your turn to 
guard and protect this generation.
                 Most sincerely,
                 Chandra Bewell
