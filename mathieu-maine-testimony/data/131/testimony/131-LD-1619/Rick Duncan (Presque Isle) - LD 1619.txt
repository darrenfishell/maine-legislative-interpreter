Dear Legislators,
It is with my most heartfelt concern that I write to you today. I have served on several 
health care boards for many years. During those times I would hear of the the heroic 
efforts of our amazing health care providers in their efforts to save the lives of 
countless prematurely born infants. Those efforts were for the most part successful, 
and these babies have gone on to grow into wonderful productive human beings. 
Every tool know to modern science has been implemented to secure their survival 
outside of the womb. These health care heroes have made every effort to ensure they 
at least had a chance to enjoy life as we all have had the chance to enjoy.
It saddens me greatly that some of these same human beings would have their chance 
of enjoying what we enjoy, taken away, even at the point of their full term 
development. 
We are the people of Maine, we care for all of the citizens of Maine. Mainers defend 
the rights of its people to enjoy everything that life has to offer. Not to cut it short 
prior to the moment it should begin.
You are all good people, do the right thing for All of our citizens. We all deserve a 
chance, even if we havenâ€™t fully developed yet.
Respectfully
Rick Duncan
