Subject: Opposition to LD 1619 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. -â€˜ 
My name is Edward Pettit and I live in Scarborough, Maine. My wife and I have two children and four beautiful 
grandchildren, all living in Maine. I am testifying in opposition to Govemer Mill's proposal to eliminate 
viability restrictions on the practice of abortion in Maine, which she proposes in violation of campaign promises 
to leave current law as it stands. Govemer Mill's is apparently determined to kill viable babies. My wife andI 
am in complete opposition to this bill! Sincerely Edward Pettit.
