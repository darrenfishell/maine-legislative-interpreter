LD 1619
I am writing to thank you for your service to the state of Maine and to express my 
concern about LD 1619 which would allow the late term abortion of babies who are 
well able to survive outside their mother’s womb. Abortion at ANY time for ANY 
reason is too extreme for decent citizens and is reminiscent of Nazi extermination 
policy especially since Medical Necessity is already covered under current Maine 
law. What kind of people are we if we deny the voiceless the basic right to life, liberty
and pursuit of happiness just because they can’t vote or pay taxes?  Maine’s motto is 
“The way life should be.” LD 1619 does not belong here. Please vote “ought not to 
pass.”
