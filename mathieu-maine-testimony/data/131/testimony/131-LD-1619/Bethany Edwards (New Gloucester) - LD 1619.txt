Bethany Edwards
New Gloucester
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee. My name is 
Bethany Edwards and I live in New Gloucester.  I am writing to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619. 
I am a mother of 3 young girls and 4 other children who were miscarried. With my 
third miscarriage, I passed the baby at home in the middle of the night at 8 weeks 
pregnant. Emotionally, I held my dead child in my hands and observed the obvious 
head shape and outline of small nubs that would have eventually turned into fingers. 
At 8 weeks old in utero this baby was a life. 
I want to see the state of Maine protecting life. Allowing this bill to pass would allow 
for a baby who could live outside of the womb to be murdered. LD 1619 is too 
extreme for Maine. It does not fix the issue at hand. Maine needs to improve how we 
support pregnant mothers and give all women hope, encouragement, and practical 
essentials to help raise their children. All women deserve the dignity of protecting life
and I'm afraid they are not given enough information to make a clear choice. These 
unborn children deserve life and a chance to contribute to society. Please do not let 
this bill pass.
