Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary 
committee. My name is Stephanie Grondin, I am a lifelong Mainer and I urge you to 
oppose LD 1619.  
 
This legislation will undoubtedly bring to our state people motivated by a highly lucrative 
business opportunity. The vague wording in this bill will allow an abortion of a viable 
baby for any reason which is irresponsible. According to Planned Parenthood’s website 
the average cost of an abortion in the 1st trimester is about $600 and up to $2,000 in the 
2nd trimester. One can logically assume that an abortion of a fully developed baby in the 
3rd trimester would cost substantially more. This website also states that “most in-clinic 
abortions only take about 5-10 minutes.” One doctor in an 8 hour work day could easily 
perform 50 abortions and make $50,000 or more each day. This would create a very 
profitable industry in Maine, but one for which Mainers do not want to be notoriously 
known.  
 
In addition, the removal of the criminal punishment of an unlicensed person performing 
an abortion is repugnant and reckless. This only invites trouble by enticing people 
without proper training to perform dangerous interventions thus putting the health of 
countless women in grave danger. The removal of punishment is shameful, there must be 
severe punishments for those who perform potentially dangerous medical procedures 
without proper medical training and licensure. 
 
Please oppose LD 1619, it is terrible for Maine.
