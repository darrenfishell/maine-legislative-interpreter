Testimony Opposing LD 1619 on May 1, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary,  my name is Mike Rioux and I live in Windham. I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I have been a resident in Maine all my life and have lived here because people are 
friendly, honest and have a deep respect for life.  If this extreme bill of LD 1619 
passes, respect for life will go away.  Having a law that would legalize the murder 
of potentially thousands of fully formed babies, who are totally capable of living 
and unable to voice their concerns, would be horrific in so many ways, not to 
mention our stateâ€™s reputation. It would also invite pregnant women from other 
states with more restrictive abortion laws to have an abortion here in Maine. 
In the end, we will all have to answer to our Creator for the decisions we make 
during our lifetime. Your vote is critically important and can have devastating 
effects for the lives of thousands of unborn babies in the future. I pray that you 
will make the right decision and oppose the passing of this legislation. 
Thank you, 
Mike Rioux
