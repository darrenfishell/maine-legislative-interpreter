Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary,
No LD 1619   The media has done a good job telling the very sad story of Dana 
Pierce's terrible ordeal. It did not however explain the ramifications of this extreme 
bill.  This one tragic story is not enough reason to change the laws we have in Maine. 
This bill does not reflect the way most people feel.  In fact, most people are not aware
of how awful this bill is.
The Maine Attorney General stated current laws provide exceptions to the viability 
restrictions in the case of a fatal fetal diagnosis.  So in essence, this bill is not 
necessary.
LD 1619 will allow a child to be aborted anytime before birth and for any reason.  
Unlicensed healthcare workers will be able to perform abortions without any 
repercussions if the mother is injured. The life and well being of the mother has been 
removed completely from the bill. The development of the child doesn't matter at all.  
This is not medical care!
Medical experts agree that fetal pain begins at 12 weeks.  Many pro life organizations 
defend life based on the testimony of former abortionists.  Resource information is 
provided.
The State of Maine currently allows abortion up to 20 weeks. I urge you to oppose 
this bill. Also I encourage you to take the time to understand the procedures of a late 
term abortion.
