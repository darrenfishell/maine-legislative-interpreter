I am testifying because I think the whole truth needs to be heard before considering a 
bill that is so irresponsible, and such a crime even medical professionals who take an 
oath would not be performing these malicious acts. 
There are laws in place to protect woman if they have a life threatening 
situation/condition during pregnancy that may require a termination of pregnancy. 
This bill to consider allowing abortion to full term is evil. 
I believe even if we set aside the fact that people need to be responsible for their own 
actions, and consider that atrocities do happen that may put someone in a 
compromising position and they do not want a baby, murder is not the answer? 
Tell me how the abortion works at full term? That is a living human being, at 9 
months, that, in most cases, does not require any assistance for life or breathing! Do 
we need to go to extremes? I wish we didn't, there is no mild response to this bill, 
because it is extreme to even consider it. Murder is not the answer.
