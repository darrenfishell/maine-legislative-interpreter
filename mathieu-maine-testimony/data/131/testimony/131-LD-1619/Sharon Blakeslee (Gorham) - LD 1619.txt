Please do Not pass this bill to make legal abortion at full term. This is criminal. I 
appeal to your conscience and sensibilities.  These babies have no voice and must be 
protected.  It is their inalienable right as a human.        Please remember that God 
knew us before we were born.
Respectfully,
Sharon
