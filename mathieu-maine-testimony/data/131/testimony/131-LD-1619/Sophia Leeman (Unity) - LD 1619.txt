LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Sophia Leeman and I am a resident of 
Unity. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619. I am 32, and after years of 
trying, had my first baby, a boy, Silas, born March of 2022. What an absolute light he 
is. I was born in Waterville and have lived in Maine my entire life. I have looked 
forward to the idea of raising my children here because I love this place and my love 
only intensifies as I get older. I want to share the beauty of this state with my children 
and LD 1619 does not represent all that is beautiful here. One of the first things we 
learn is (my son just turned 1 and we have already taught him this) Do Not Hurt 
Others. Do not hurt your siblings, parents, classmates,  teammates, animals, yourself. 
You do not inflict harm onto others, ever. So why is it okay to inflict pain and death 
to a baby?  We should not be fighting to harm another in any capacity. This is why I 
believe abortion at any time for any reason is not acceptable. Medical necessity is 
already covered in the current law, we do not need this drastic and extreme bill in 
Maine. Thank you for your time.
