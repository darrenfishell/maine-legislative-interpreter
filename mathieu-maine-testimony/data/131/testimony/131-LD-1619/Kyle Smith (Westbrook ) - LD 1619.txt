I strongly support the rights of the unborn.  The murder of preboen children needs to 
stop.  This bill goes in the opposite direction.  The right to equality starts with the 
right to life.  Abortion is murder, and is the blight on our society.  Our children will 
look back at the abortion era the same way we look back on other terrors of the past.  
Do not sign this bill.
