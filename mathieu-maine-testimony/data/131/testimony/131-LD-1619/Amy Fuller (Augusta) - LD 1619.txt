Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
I just wanted to throw my support behind this bill, to combat the loud minority 
(because they are the minority, even if they show up in large numbers today) trying to
force their religious views on everyone else.
As you know, abortion is healthcare and this decision is between a pregnant person 
and their doctor. The minority can spin the bill however they want - it still says "only 
when necessary" past viability. It's not "abortion on demand", and it doesn't allow 
"anyone" to perform an abortion like the Republicans are claiming. Forced birth and 
forced pregnancy are also human rights violations according to international law. I 
hope to see the committee vote "Ought to Pass" on this bill.
Thank you for your time,
Amy Fuller
