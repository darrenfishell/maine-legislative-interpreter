Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary: . 
My name is Darlene Field and I am a resident of Brunswick. l am here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
l would like to call as evidence every person standing or sitting here today, that from conception 
through birth and beyond, every fetus is a precious, unique human being. 
Regardless of circumstances, l believe each life should be respected and protected. Only for extreme 
medical necessity should one life be taken for another, as a last resort. 
Women have been given by our creator the privilege of being a participant in the creation of life. From 
twenty weeks on, most women can feel the movement of their babies. We are the ones rolling and 
turning, stretching, sucking our thumb, pressing a foot against the wall of the womb (which is hard to 
ignore) or perhaps hiccuping. These are signs of life you cannot ignore. 
This bill would allow the taking of a life when the baby is able to survive outside of the womb. l would 
pray that the people of Maine would value all life. Babies matter, too. They are our future. 
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 1619. 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Darlene Field
