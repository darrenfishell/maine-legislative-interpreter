I am a voting citizen of Maine and am strongly opposed to this bill. This bill makes 
the life of my son invalid. He had Potter's Syndrome and died after living outside of 
the womb for only 45 minutes. He was not meant to live outside the womb but his life
was precious. He was breathing, growing, his heart was beating and his brain was 
developing. This bill says to this generation that their lives do not matter because it's 
all disposable. The only difference between the day before my son was born and the 
day he was born was that his lungs had not developed. The difference between the 
day my other children were born and the day before was simply location but they 
continued to live.
