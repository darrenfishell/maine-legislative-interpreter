I am currently 9 months pregnant and as I try to find the words to express whatâ€™s in 
my heart, I feel the baby in my womb pushing about as if she too has something she 
must say. And so I must speak up for my daughter who does not yet have her voice, 
and for so many babies who will lose their lives if this bill passes. 
We used to be told that in the beginning stages of pregnancy it was just a piece of 
tissue and not a baby yet so it was ok to abort it. At 9 months pregnancy no one can 
possibly deny that what is being killed is a baby. A baby that can feel pain and that 
has a personality all its own. I know that many will make the argument that late term 
abortions would be used for babies that will have severe disabilities and no good 
quality of life, but where do we draw the line? There are those who want to legalize 
the killing of babies up to 2 years old!  Think back to nazi Germany. At first they 
began to sterilize the parents of children who were deemed unfit, then they began 
actually ending the lives of anyone who was considered unfit, building the gas 
chambers to do away with them all. How do we stop the proverbial slippery slope 
which we are already on? How do we ensure, this far but no more? Passing this bill 
and legalizing late term abortion will only send us further down that slope. Please, 
protect life. Protect our unborn who cannot yet speak for themselves. 
Sincerely,
A mother to a 3 year old, a baby lost to miscarriage, and one still in the womb
