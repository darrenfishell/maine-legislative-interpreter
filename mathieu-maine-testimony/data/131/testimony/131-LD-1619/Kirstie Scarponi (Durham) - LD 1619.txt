I do not support this bill. The current laws that are in place for reproductive rights 
give women plenty of time if they choose to abort their unborn child. Up to birth is 
extreme, egregious and does not consider the life of the child. That childâ€™s life is 
meaningful and to take their life before giving them a shot to be loved on this earth is 
a tragedy. Please pass on moving forward with this bill to give those lives a chance.
