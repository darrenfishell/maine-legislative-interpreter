endured 40 years of mutilation, dismemberment of limbs for the purpose of sale to scientiﬁc 
organizations, and subjected to untold pain and suffering endured when taken from their natural 
habitat ( mother's womb) and deprived of its natural space for growth, food, water, light or other 
nutritional, and there rightful place on earth, having thereby met the criterium to be considered as 
candidates as a most imperiled species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and Amended Law of 
1978. Having met the criteria, this Nation must consider for conservation, funding appropriation 
necessary as requested in the Biden Administration in 2022, that Congress raise the spending for

endangered human species to full term and life as determined by the Power of God.
