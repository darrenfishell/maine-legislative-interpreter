I am against the expansion of abortion both before and after "viability."  I also am 
against the abortion being done without the consent of the father, and the consent of 
the grandparents, if the mother is a minor.  Science is clear that life begins at 
conception, and taking the life of an unborn child at any gestational age is harming 
the most innocent in our society.  This is not a personal choice when it involves the 
life of another.  Many grandparents in Maine raise their grandchildren, and each child 
conceived needs to be given life, with an appropriate home found for the baby.  In 
addition, abortion is psychologically damaging to the parents, especially the mother.  
Research is clear about this, also.  Thank you.
