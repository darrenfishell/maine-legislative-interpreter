LD 1619
I Whitney Brum herby am in opposition of this bill LD 1619. I am strongly against 
post-viability abortion allowing doctors to deem what’s necessary beyond the health 
or mothers life at risk. I don’t believe a mother has rights to take away the life of her 
child one month after birth. Why would it be okay to take away the life anytime 
before that. Any woman can find a doctor willing to deem an abortion necessary 
while there’s doctors that would never deem the same exact patient/situation 
necessary. A decision to terminate should not be treated as lightly and normalized as 
it has. It is traumatic to terminate a human life and it is traumatic for the mothers for 
the rest of their lives. There are better ways. Life is a gift not trash.
