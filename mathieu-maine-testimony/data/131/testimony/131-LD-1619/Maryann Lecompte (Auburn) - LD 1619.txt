SENATOR CARNEY, REPRESENTATIVE MOONEN, AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY—I had planned to testify in person but due to a family 
emergency was not able to be present.  My name is Maryann Lecompte, a Democrat from Auburn testifying 
in opposition to LD 1619:  Thank you sincerely for your service as a member on this crucial Committee.  This 
bill leaves me with questions for your consideration. 
1. First theme is one of DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSIVTY (DEI): 
As a lifelong educator (recently retired from UNE in Biddeford), I have covered DEI topics and have come to 
learn that the Planned Parenthood founder “shepherded the American EUGENICS 
movement…..Fundamentally the abortion industry predicates itself on the conclusion that human beings do 
not have equal value and some human lives are expendable.”  Martin Luther King’s niece, Dr. Alveda King 
states:  “We can no longer sit idly by and allow this horrible spirit of murder ……we must first acknowledge the 
abortion industry’s EXPLOITATION of women.” She talks about justice and empowering women to choose life!

parenthood-n2617952  
This leads me to the QUESTION:   
• Why are the THESE topics seldom discussed in the abortion debate especially the stance of MLK’s niece on 
systemic racism? 
 
2. Second theme of MONEY: 
I often wonder if money could be part of the motive of entities that perform abortions.  Please take no offense 
to my heartfelt, sincere, delicate pondering.  
QUESTIONS: 
• Q1. What becomes of the unborn aborted child’s CELLS, TISSUES, and ORGANS?  Is the mother given the 
option to have the child’s remains?  If the mother does not receive the remains, is there a market and 
revenue connected with the unborn child’s remains for either research purposes or organ harvesting? Or is 
the baby incinerated or discarded as medical waste as the most cost effective method? 
• Q2. Is MEDICAL TOURISM an unspoken goal in Maine becoming a sanctuary State for abortion with one of 
the most extreme laws in the country? And with this do we dispel our current motto of the “Way Life 
Should Be” except for the unborn child?  
 
AND LASTLY IF LD 1619 MOVES FORWARD I ADAMANENTLY REQUEST ADVOCATES FOR THE UNBORN CHILD 
BE MANDATED AND WRITTEN INTO THE BILL 
BECAUSE ABORTION AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IS TOO EXTREME FOR MAINE AND BECAUSE CHILDREN 
CAN BE VIABLE OUTSIDE OF THE WOMB AFTER 20 TO 22 WEEKS, please include the appointing of two 
advocates for the unborn child. 
1. A GUARDIAN AD LITEM (GAL) who can represent the unborn child’s Pro Choice participation. The courts 
should appoint a Guardian to gather information and prepare recommendations concerning the child’s 
protection. Is it possible to determine that the reasons for an abortion are indeed in the child’s best 
interests? 
2. A PHYSICIAN FOR THE UNBORN CHILD for PAIN MANAGEMENT IF IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT 
ABORTION IS IN THE CHILD’S BEST INTEREST. Because there is pain for the unborn child, would a physician 
feel torn between the “Do Not Harm” creed if asked to participate as the child’s physician?  If you have 
viewed the partial birth abortion videos and know that unborn children’s nervous systems are formed as 
early as 6 weeks and various sources state that fetuses can feel pain anywhere from 20 to 24 weeks, how 
can we attempt to at least be vigilant to cause NO pain?   
ALL THE BEST TO EACH OF YOU! THANK YOU FOR READING MY TESTIMONY! 
PLEASE VOTE OUGHT NOT TO PASS LD 1619.
