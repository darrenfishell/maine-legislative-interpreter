LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Ramona Y.  My husband and I have 3 children who are all married. and 
have children of their own.  I am a grandmother of ten!  They range in ages from 1 
month to 16 years old.  I have held each of them as babies, a couple born early,  I 
canâ€™t even imagine someone wanting to abort such a life.
Life is precious.   The future of our state depends on how we regard life.  This is not 
what the majority of Maine wants.  I strongly oppose LD619.  This is not right for 
ME.
Please vote no on LD1619.
Thank you!
