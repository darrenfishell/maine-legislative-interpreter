I strongly urge you to reject this evil measure that would kill innocent babies.  Babies 
who have been given a life worth living and are loved by God.  
As St. Teresa of Calcutta stated, “It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that 
you may live as you wish” and "Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its 
people to love, but to use violence to get what they want."
I believe that life begins at conception and believe in the dignity of each human 
person from the moment of conception and these babies should be valued and loved, 
not killed.  
There is never a good reason to kill babies up to the moment of birth.  This is a radical
bill that should be defeated.  Please oppose this unnecessary bill.
