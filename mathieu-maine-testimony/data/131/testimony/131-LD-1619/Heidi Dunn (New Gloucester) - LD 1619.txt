Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Ioint Standing 
Committee on Iudiciary, my name is Heidi Dunn and I am a resident of New Gloucester. Asa 
follower of lesus Christ, a Mainer, and a mother of 6 children I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
Recently, I read an article titled, â€œ0% chance of survival: World's most premature twins 
defy doctors" . Written by the Guinness Book of World Records, the article discussed how 
twins born 126 days early to a couple in Canada, had just celebrated their 15* birthday. 
During their birth, the parents were told that their babies had zero percent chance of 
survival, yet even though they each weighed less than llb at birth, they are both now living 
at home and meeting their age adjusted milestones. 
Iwas even more amazed when I discovered that this record only beats the previous record 
by 1 day, which was held by twins born in the United States who are now almost 4 years 
old. l had no idea this was even possible! Twins surviving outside the womb at 22 weeks?! 
With miracles like this, why is the current administration in the State of Maine submitting 
legislation to legalize abortion right up until full-term birth?! It is clear that if TWINS can 
survive outside of the womb as early as 22 weeks, then single births have an even greater 
chance of survival. We must speak up for these voiceless children. 
LD1619 is seeking to allow for a baby who is a viable life outside the womb to be aborted. 
Almost all countries in the world do not allow such extreme abortion measures. I cannot 
fathom that the state of Maine is even considering such an atrocious bill as LD1619. 
I hope that, you, the Iudiciary Committee will remember the stories of these twins, who 
fought for their lives against all odds, and vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD1619. 
Thank you.
