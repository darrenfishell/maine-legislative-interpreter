Scott Dutkiewicz 
Newport
LD 1619
My name is 
My name is Scott Dutkiewicz, I love in Newport, and I am writing in opposition of 
the bill LD 1619.
My opposition against this bill is built on the thought, that destruction, does not, and 
cannot build beauty. 
If you were to put a stick of dynamite under a pile of rocks, and ignite it, it will not 
build you a beautiful stone wall. 
Also, if you were to take a pile driver into the woods and pile drive all the trees in the 
forest, you would not bring forth lumber to build beautiful homes. 
In the same way, if you were to destroy a life, which is exactly what this bill is 
fighting to do, you would not bring forth beauty in the lives of generations to come. 
You would only be ending a heartbeat. Ending something beautiful and replacing it 
with emptiness and hurt. 
We need to stand with the unborn, to always be the voice for the voiceless. They canâ€™t
fight for themselves, so I will take every opportunity to be their voice. 
Thank you for your time.
