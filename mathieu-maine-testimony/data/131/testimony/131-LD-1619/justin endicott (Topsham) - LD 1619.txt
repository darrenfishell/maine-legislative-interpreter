Please don't allow such evil, as it is already so much evil in the world. In the Nazi war
crime trials the Nazis said to the American prosecutor your in America we are in 
Germany, so what right do you have to tell us that we are in the wrong and the court 
was going to conclude on that. No prosecution was going to come to the Nazis for 
brutal murder until the prosecutor said no there is a higher rule and that is God and the
trial resumed. Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by 
making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings 
of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of 
innocents, and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt 
offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my 
mind— therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when this place shall 
no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of 
Slaughter.
Jeremiah 19:4‭-‬6
