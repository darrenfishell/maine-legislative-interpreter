LD 1619
May 1, 2023
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Helen Tutwiler and I am a resident of 
Winslow. I am writing to you today to oppose LD1619. I am against late-term 
abortion and would hope you are too. 
Sincerely,
Helen Tutwiler
