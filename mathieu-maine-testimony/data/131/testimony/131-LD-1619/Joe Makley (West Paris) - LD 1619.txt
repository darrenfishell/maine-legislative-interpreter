Comments for the Maine Judiciary Committee on May 1, 2023 
ED 1619 An Act to improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
1. 
2. in its effort to accommodate difficult situations near the margins of current law, this bill 
weakens the viability standard. A physician, however medically qualiﬁed, must 
recognize and baiance with the "life and health of the mother” certain iegai rights an 
infant begins to have past the threshold of viability. It is said that a discretionary late 
term abortion, one for reasons other than medical health, do not happen, that this is 
not a reaiistic concem. The proposed changes in this statute wouid not only allow (or 
even encourage) such a thing but could make Maine a center for it, a place where 
people come to have it done. l don't think a majority of Maine citizens would be in favor 
ofthat. 
The bill removes or reduces the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without 
being licensed. This feature of the bill is disqualifying. It appears to say that 
practitioners must be iicensed, but i'f they are not, weil, don”t worry about ? if 
enacted as worded, it could have the effect of making Maine a center for unlicensed 
practice. Again, l do not think a majority of Maine citizens would want that. 
For the above reasons I wish to register opposition to LD 1619.
