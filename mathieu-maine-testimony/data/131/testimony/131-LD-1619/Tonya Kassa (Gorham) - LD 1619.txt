Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Tonya Kassa, and I'm a resident of Gorham. l'm here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
l'm very concerned about bill LD 1619 which is being introduced in Maine and would allow for 
abortion up until birth, regardless of whether the mother's health is in danger or not. We already 
have that law in the books and this bill removes the provision that the mother's health must be in 
dangen 
I want you all to think about what abortion up until birth means. We are no longer talking about 
rape or incest because you would have known you were violated 8 months before and had time 
to abort. We are no longer talking about a clump of cells. We are talking about a baby that could 
be viable outside the mother's womb! 
Most of you have children; think about the first time you held your baby. This bill is enabling 
someone to legally end that baby's life 10 minutes before the moment you hold them in your 
arms. This would entail great violence and no longerjust a D&C; the abortionist would have to 
kill the baby because at that stage, they are viable outside the womb. Once the baby can be 
viable outside the womb, this is no longer an issue of women's rights, this is an issue of human 
rights!' 
For all of you hearing this, you must understand if this passes, people of the future will be 
horrified at the ghoulishness of our culture. They will want to know where you stood on this. At 
that time, you can say “l supported this bill” which is your right. You can say “l turned a blind eye 
to this bil|" and be thought of just like the Germans in VVWll. However, you can’t say, “l didn’t 
know" . If you vote for this bill, this crime against humanity will rest on your shoulders and your 
name forever. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
