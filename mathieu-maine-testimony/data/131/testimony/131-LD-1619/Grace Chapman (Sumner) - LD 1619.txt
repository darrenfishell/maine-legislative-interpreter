Grace Chapman
Sumner
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee,
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, 
Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."
Such are the words of our founding fathers, the sacrifices of whom have propelled us 
into this beautiful nation of freedom and prosperity. As a patriotic citizen of America, 
whose people you have solemnly sworn to represent, I urge you STRONGLY to 
OPPOSE LD 1619. 
In addition to my appeal to you to honor the lives of infants, who so close to being 
born, are being denied their "certain unalienable Rights" to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness I MUST urge you to honor your forefathers, your freedom, and 
your fellow countrymen by truly hearing and representing the people of Maine, of 
whom I am one. 
After enduring endless hours of public testimony, it must be self-evident, just as the 
truths of our glorious Declaration of Independence, that the overwhelming majority of
Maine votes NO on this bill. Far be it from our Maine legislation to follow in the 
footsteps of the tyrant whose rule we sought to escape, due largely to his lack of 
representation of the thirteen colonies in Britain.
Represent your people. Uphold justice. 
I, Grace Chapman, appeal to you to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD 1619.
