Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Makenzie 
Ramos and l’m from Orrington. 
l am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619 which states that “After 
viability an abortion may be performed only when it is necessary in the 
professional judgment of a physician licensed pursuant to Title 32, 
chapter 36 or 48.” Now, as exclusive as “professional judgment ” may 
sound, it is far from that. “Professional Judgment ” is applying 
knowledge, skills and experience in a way to develop an opinion or 
decision about what is best for a client. My dad owns a sandwich shop 
and it is in his “professional judgment ” that a customer should geta 
Reuben rather than a BLT. So as you can see the term “professional 
judgment ” should not be the basis on which generations of human 
lives stand. 
This new bill also takes out what used to be included which states, 
“Any person not so licensed who knowingly performs an abortion on 
another person or any person who knowingly assists a nonlicensed 
person to perform an abortion on another person is guilty of a ClassC 
crime.” Taking this statement out of the bill takes away the punishment 
from an uneducated, unlicensed, inexperienced person who performs 
an abortion on someone and takes away their child's life. So let me 
ask you this, would you want me, a 15 year old, sophomore in high 
school to perform an abortion on you or your wife? Would you trusta 
pregnant woman’s life in the hands of a girl who hasn't yet completed 
Algebra 2? 
If indeed you are human, I assume your answers to those questions 
would be no which is why I urge you to vote ought not to pass. Thank 
you for your time and consideration.
