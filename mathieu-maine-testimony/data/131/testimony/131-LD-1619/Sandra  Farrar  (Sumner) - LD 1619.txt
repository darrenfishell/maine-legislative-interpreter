Sandra  Farrar 
Sumner
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Sandra Farrar of Sumner. As a blessed mother of two, I know that a 
pregnancy is a beautiful life. I was 16 when I first became pregnant. There was not a 
pressure to abort at that time (I am an 85 year old woman), however I was not allowed
to finish high school. That was the culture for the time. I later went on to get my GED
and then earned my associates degree at 29. 
Over the course of my lifetime, I have known many young girls who aborted, mostly 
out of convenience. I now know that I have had 2 great grandchildren who also have 
been aborted.
A pregnancy is a beautiful life, so much potential has been destroyed by abortion. I 
can understand that pregnancy can be seen as an inconvience, but each child should 
be allowed to live. Options to adopt are available.
I strongly oppose LD 1619; please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS.
