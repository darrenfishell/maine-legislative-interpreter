Myra Broadway
Gardiner
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonan, members of the Judiciary Committee, my 
name is Myra Broadway, a resident of Gardiner, and I speak in opposition  to LD 
1619.
The great American author, John Steinbeck, once said that we have only one story,  
allâ€¦built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil.
Make no mistake, the taking of an innocent life of an unborn child  - whether the verb 
chosen is aborting, terminating, relieving the mother of her pregnancy - is evil.  In 
fact, when you think about it, the action itself has all the elements of murder one: 
willfulness, deliberation and premeditation.  It is no wonder that this issue is always  
contentious - no one wants to realistically face what it really is - and that is EVIL.
1619 is over the top since Maine already permits abortion through 24 weeks of 
gestation - with ample provision for the health and welfare of the mother beyond that. 
The governor last fall said that she would not seek to expand abortion. The noble 
thing to do is vote this bill ought not to pass and allow her the honor of keeping her 
word.
Thank you for your consideration.
