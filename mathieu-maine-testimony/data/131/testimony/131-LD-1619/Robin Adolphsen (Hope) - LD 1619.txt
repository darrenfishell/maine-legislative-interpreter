LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Commitee on Judiciary, my name is Robin Adolphsen, I am a resident of 
Hope.  I am in opposition to LD 1619.
The fact that people have gathered today, May 1st, 2023 to discuss this extreme bill 
requires not gentle words, but true words and sometimes true words do not sound 
gentle.
Some of you may think that you will vote yes and go home,  your part is done.  The 
truth is your part has just begun!  From that day on every time a tiny human life is 
snuffed out by an abortionist because of LD1619 it will be your hand print on that 
child.  You are the guilty party not just the abortionist. 
You may pass a law here on earth, but there is a greater law given, by a Holy God, 
which say, "Thou shalt not kill." He values all human life! 
I urge you to consider these truths and vote ought not to pass on this heinous bill.
Thank you
