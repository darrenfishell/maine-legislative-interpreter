Lauren  Flanagan
Augusta
LD 1619
My name is Lauren Flanagan. I am from here in Augusta, Maine, and I am writing in 
opposition to the bill LD1619. 
As the mother of four children, I am well aware of journey of pregnancy. I have seen 
the ultrasounds that showed my children's unique personhood even in the womb. I 
have been in situations where I was scared to be carrying a child, thinking it was not 
the right time, worried that nothing would turn out right. We made it. We are thriving.
This bill is far to extreme for Maine, especially considering that 2/3 of Mainers don't 
agree with late-term abortion. There is no medical reason that necessitates the murder 
of a full term baby. An emergency delivery, for certain, but not the death of the child. 
You do not have to kill the child to save the mother. 
The lack of clarity and boundaries in the bill will be detrimental to the health of 
Maine women. Please reconsider this bill. For the women, for the children, please 
stand up and say no. Be on the side of history that extends the circle of who has value.
