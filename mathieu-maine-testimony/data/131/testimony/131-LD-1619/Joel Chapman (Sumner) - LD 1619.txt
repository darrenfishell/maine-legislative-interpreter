Joel Chapman
Sumner
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Joel Chapman and I reside in Sumner. I am writing today in opposition to
LD 1619. 
It is very dangerous to cheapen human life because once you come to the place of 
disregarding the life of a baby, who is next? The mentally handicapped? The elderly? 
Over the course of the last 30 years, I have spoken with many women who have had 
abortions and without exception, it haunts every single one of them. 
I believe with all my heart that we will be held accountable for whether or not we 
defended the defenseless. 
I urge you to vote ought NOT to pass on LD 1619.
