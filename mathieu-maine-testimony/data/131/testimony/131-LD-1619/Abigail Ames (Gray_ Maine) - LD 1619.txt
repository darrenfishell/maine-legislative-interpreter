Dear Reader,
I cannot begin to describe the sorrow that has overcome me since hearing about the 
suggestion of legalizing abortion up to the birth of a child.
Let me ask you this: Is it legal to kill a human? Is it legal for a mother to kill her child
(no matter the age)? What if the mother had a baby in her home and decided a few 
hours, a few days, or a few months in that she had changed her mind and no longer 
wanted the child? What if no one knew she had the baby? Would she be exempt if she
disposed of her child in secret?
Is not the killing of a child in the womb, with no accountability, just another form of 
murder behind closed doors? 
"Hush, hush, dear child who has ears to hear and pain receptors formed. Hush, hush, 
the stripping apart of your body will all be over soon. You are still in my home, I am 
in charge, therefore, I can choose what to do with you. No one will know. It's fine. It 
will only hurt a little, or a lot. It's fine." A mother may not say these words aloud to 
her child, but actions speak louder than words.
I beg of you to stop and consider how evil this is. Are we not as bad as Hitler if we 
orchestrate or agree with the killing of millions of innocent lives?
But this is not just a plea to prevent abortions from happening. This is a plea for 
change. We need MORE support for mothers who keep their children in challenging 
circumstances. We need LESS sex advertised everywhere and MORE healthy life 
styles, foster care, and adoption promoted. There are millions of women who have 
lost a child or can't get pregnant and would jump at the ability to love and care for 
someone else's baby. Make adoptions EASIER.
Together, we can make a difference.
