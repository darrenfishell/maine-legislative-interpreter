Catherine Pearce
Roque Bluffs
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Catherine Pearce and I live in Roque Bluffs, Maine.  I am testifying today
through written submission in opposition of LD1619.
I am standing today on behalf of woman that will be unwittingly emotionally 
traumatized and have their wombs cauterized if this bill is passed.  I am standing 
today for their unborn child that they will never hold and never see laugh if a bill 
entitled an Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Laws is passed.  
I personally know several women that have had an abortion for various reasons.  
None of them live without the grief of the child they chose to terminate; they mourn 
for that child, they live with pain and sorrow.  They were traumatized emotionally by 
making the decision to terminate their pregnancy, which they now understand was to 
murder their own child.  Their grief is real.  Their child is dead.
Honorable Members of the Judiciary, I implore you to soberly stand on behalf of the 
women of Maine, to keep them from years of being haunted by the death of their child
and from an experience from which they will never recover emotionally or spiritually.
Thank you.
