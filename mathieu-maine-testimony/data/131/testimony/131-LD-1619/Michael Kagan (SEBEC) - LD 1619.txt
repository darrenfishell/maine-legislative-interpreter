LD 1619
I am opposed to LD1619.  I believe that this bill is in direct opposition to the 
hypocratic oath that many doctors take when entering the field of medicine, 
specifically, to "do no harm".  I fail to see how this bill is about reproductive privacy 
and feel that this title is deceptive.  Please reconsider this bill.  Please remember when
you vote that you are placing a child's life on one side of the scales of justice and your
career on the other side.  The Word of God states that He (God) hates unjust weights 
and measures.  This bill is an example of unjust weights and the souls of the Judiciary
committee are in the balance.  Even if you are not bound by God's laws, you are 
bound by your own ethics and your vote will reflect this to everyone in this State.
