Amanda Lovley
Levant
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, My name is 
Amanda Lovley and I am a resident of Levant.  I am writing to testify in opposition to
LD1619. Abortion ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine.  This bill 
would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed, that is murder! 
God's word does not condone abortion but indeed condems it.  Exodus 20:13 "You 
shall not commit murder"  one of God's Commandments.  "Someone's helplessness or
dependency should motivate us to protect them not to destroy them." Maine would 
have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country.  Please oppose this 
unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Maine do not want to see pass.  Thank 
You.
