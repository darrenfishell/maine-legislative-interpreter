SPEAK UP FOR LIFE 
LD 1619 
May 1, 2023 
ln early 1950 there was a young woman who found herself pregnant. 
She was in College for a business degree. The Father was a married man 
with children. She had severe epilepsy with Grand Mal Seizure’s. Unable to 
care for that infant she gave him up for adoption. That "child was me. My 
biological Grandfather was opposed to that decision and wanted to keep 
me in their family but the decision was up to her. The adoption took place 
and I was loved & blessed by my new family. l continue to live a full Life. 
LDl 619 is severely offensive to me and it’s taking us backwards. 
infanticide is barbaric & wrong. ls this your Final Solution by legalizing 
Late Term abortion. Please oppose this bill. ‘LDl 619 is not for Mainers. 
Thank You for your time. David W. Whitehead
