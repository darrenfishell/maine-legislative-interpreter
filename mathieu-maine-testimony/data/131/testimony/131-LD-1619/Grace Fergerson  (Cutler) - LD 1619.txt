I appose this bill. As a nation we have come so far from the sanctity of life. I believe 
as well as you should that every human life is precious and should be protected. A 
mothers womb is where a child should be the safest yet, is that still true? Does that 
mean anything to this nation anymore? God created us in his image. He died for every
single human being…even the ones still in their mommy’s bellies.
