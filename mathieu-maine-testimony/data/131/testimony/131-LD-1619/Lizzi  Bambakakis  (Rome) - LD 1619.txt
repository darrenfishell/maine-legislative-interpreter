LD 1619
My name is Lizzi Bambakakis and i am a Rome resident. I have 6 kids and am a birth 
doula. I am writing to testify I opposition to the bill LD1619. Having multiple 
children, and being an aid to many pregnant and birthing people, I  understand how it 
can feel overwhelming to have a child. Especially at the end of pregnancy, things can 
get very overwhelming very quickly and feel like there’s no way out. This is why we 
need better maternal care and trauma counseling. But allowing extreme measures of 
abortion at full term should not be legal. It is taking a child’s life that is able to live 
outside the womb without any interventions. Current law already allows for medical 
necessity in case of stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy or other severe complications. Please 
oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill that 65% of Maine’ population does not want to 
pass. Thank you.
