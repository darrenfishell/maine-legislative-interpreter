Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Rupert Fancy and l am a resident of Presque isle. l am here to 
testify in opposition to LD1619. 
As a father of three, two of them adopted because of the courage of two young 
birth mothers, l am asking you to consider the gravity of a bill that would allow the taking 
of a life at any time for any reason. To consider one full term infant a source of joy and 
celebration and another full-term healthy child as a life easily erased is 
incomprehensible to me. 
Each one of us in this room would defend a newborn child with our lives, how can 
we possibly not protect a fully formed, healthy child days from birth. The very core of 
the American conscience is our legacy of defending the innocent and helpless around 
the world. 
As a pastor l have celebrated, with excited parents, thousands of births. l have 
watched courageous young parents fight for the lives of their newborns. I have seen 
children, born with challenges, become celebrated for their courage and joy they have 
brought to churches and communities. l have also wept with courageous moms and 
dads as we buried a child who lived only a few days. 
As representatives of a state where 65% of the people who elected you are fully 
against this bill, you have a solemn choice ahead of you. 
l speak. for myself and them asking you to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD1619. 
Thank you!
