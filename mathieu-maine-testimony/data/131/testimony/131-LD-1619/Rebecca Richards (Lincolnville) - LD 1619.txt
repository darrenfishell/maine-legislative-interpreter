LD 1619
I would like to express my dismay at the proposed LD 1619.  This bill would allow 
the termination of a pregnancy at any time, for any reason.  Protection of the life of a 
mother is already allowed by current law.  The destruction of a child's life, especially 
in later term, is abhorrent and inhumane.  
I lost my first child at birth due to multiple anomalies.  It was not expected, but even 
if it had been, I would have hung on to that baby as long as possible.  I would not 
have chosen abortion at any point.
Our society is devaluing human life at every turn.  It is no wonder that young people 
are turning to violence and suicide, when there seems to be no true compass of right 
and wrong.
Please reject this law and place value on innocent human life, especially the unborn 
developing child.
