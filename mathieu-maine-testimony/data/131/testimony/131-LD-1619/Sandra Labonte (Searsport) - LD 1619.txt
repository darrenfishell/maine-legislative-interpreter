Sandra Labonte
Searsport
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
My name is Sandra Labonte and I live in Searsport. Thank you for this opportunity to 
present this testimony (I trust that you read this email) and for your serving the state 
of Maine.
I stand opposed to LD1619, the bill allowing abortion at any time during and up to the
birth. Our current law in Maine already allows abortion for any reason for 24 weeks 
and more if deemed necessary. Incidentally, in this new bill proposed you have 
removed the necessary exceptions “to preserve the life or health of the mother”.
Why, in our beautiful state of Maine, has life become so cheap? Why would any 
doctor here agree to end the life of a fully formed human? Is this a means for our state
to make money? Do we not have a conscience anymore? God says in Exodus 23:7, 
“Do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty”.
Please vote ought not to pass.
