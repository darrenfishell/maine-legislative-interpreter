I was very disturbed to learn that LD1619 was being considered for passage.  It puts Maine at the 
forefront of late term abortions; killing babies that would otherwise be viable and depriving them of a 
chance to impact our world.  Not too long ago this would have shocked all thinking adults.  Now the 
legislature hides behind the deceptive title of “An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy 
Laws”.  Let’s at least rename it to what it is: “An Act to Allow Viable Babies to be Murdered”.  
 
The current law allows abortions for any reason up to the point where the baby can survive on its own 
outside the womb and medically necessary ones after that.  This gives the mother ample time to make a 
decision.  This expansion is unnecessary and appalling. 
 
If a baby can survive on its own and we are okay with killing it, where do we stop? We can throw in the 
euphemism “privacy” but that does not cover the disregard for human life that is creeping into our 
culture.  This is not a good trend for our society and if we can so casually do this to the most defenseless 
among us, we should ask ourselves who is next? 
 
Below is a small sample of unwanted pregnancies that would have been terminated under your proposed 
bill: 
Steve Jobs 
Jack Nicholson 
Oprah Winfrey 
Eartha Kitt 
Pope John Paul II 
Celine Dion 
Cher 
 
I urge you to reject this legislation. 
 
As a final note, it strikes me as ironic that the legislature is adamant on protecting a parent’s rights to 
assert total control over their child prior to birth; up to and including the right to kill a viable baby.  Yet, 
once the baby is born, parents’ rights are downplayed and even denigrated.  Truly upside-down thinking.
