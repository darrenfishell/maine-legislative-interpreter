LD 1619
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
I am writing to STRONGLY OPPOSE LD #1619 !!
1. This proposed bill is inhumane and nothing short of infanticide.
2. One out of six couples are infertile and desperately want to adopt. This legislation 
would end the lives of countless human beings and destroy the hopes and possibilities
for childless couples. A full term baby has the absolute right to live and, if unwanted, 
then be given up for adoption. 
3. Your vote to pass this radical legislation makes you complicit with murder with 
blood on your hands. 
4. I plead with you to ABORT THIS BILL.
