LD 1619
Vote NO on LD 1619!  For years the pro-abortion advocates have stated that back 
alley abortions are dangerous.  Now they want to advocate to remove penalties to 
anyone performing or assisting with any abortion regardless of who or where they are 
performed.  This is a blatant disregard and contradiction to the safety of mothers to 
be.  The argument that abortions are a "health care" procedure is no longer valid if 
anyone is allowed to do abortions at anytime, and anywhere without professional 
medical oversight.  If LD 1619 is allowed to move forward, then insurances, and tax 
payer money should not be use to finance back alley abortions nor the medical 
treatment needed to follow up on any botch abortion.  Pro abortion advocates cannot 
and should not have both ends of the argument and continue to be funded in the name 
of health care when it is obvious it is not about the health of the women, but the 
financial health of abortion clinics.
