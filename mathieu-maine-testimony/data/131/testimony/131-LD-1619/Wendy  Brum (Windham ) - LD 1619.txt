LD 1619
I, Wendy Brum, in regards to LD 1619.  Please act to vote AGAINST the inhumane 
bill to terminate a human child up to full time of birth.  
A question I would like to ask is why is this barbaric bill necessary AT ALL?  In 
2023 do we not have other prevention ways such as education, birth control, medical 
science and adoption as options proceeding such a hostile act?   Procedures such as 
partial birth abortion are still the things nightmares are made of.  We can cover our 
ears and say that does not affect me when in actuality abortion affects us all.  I have 
two amazing family members that were almost slaughtered before entering this world.
Abortion would have halted all their contributions in society and the joy to our family 
plus 3 precious lives we have today.   
Please before God make the right choice and choose The Right to Life!  
Because someday we will all face our Maker and be held accountable.  
Respectfully, 
Wendy Brum
