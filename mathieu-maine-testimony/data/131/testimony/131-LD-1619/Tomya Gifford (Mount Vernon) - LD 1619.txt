Tomya Gifford
Mount Vernon
LD 1619
To all honorable memebers of the joint atanding committee on judiciary, My name is 
Tonya Gifford and i m a resident of Mount Vernon. 
I am testifying in opposition of LD 1619. 
 My first doctor's appointment when i found out i was pregnant  was life changing. 
After my exam the doctor told me that i was hving an ectopic pregnancy and tried 
giving me medicine right away to "flush my system" as he put it. Luckily i refused 
and got  second opinion, that showed my son right where he needed to be, he is ten 
years old now and I'm beyond thankful everyday that we got a second opinion. Aside 
from religious, personal or moral beliefs, Doctors are human and make mistakes too, 
why give them even more power? The VERY FEW cases in an emergency setting can
alredy be done in neighboring States, please leave Maine as it is. 
Please vote ought not to pass!
