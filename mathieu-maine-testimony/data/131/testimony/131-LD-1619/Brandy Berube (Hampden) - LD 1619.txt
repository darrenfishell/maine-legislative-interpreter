Last year I became very sick. Upon entering the hospital I discovered I was 4 weeks 
pregnant. I had severe post partum anxiety after my last pregnancy and didn't plan on 
having any more children. For medical reasons abortion was mentioned by doctors on
two separate occasions. I am pro-life and knew if my life was not in jeopardy it wasn't
my right to take the life of my child. My pregnancy was by far my hardest. I was 
worried about dealing with PPA again and knew I would have to do things differently 
if I had it. My daughter was born in October and is the light of the household. It 
would have been so easy for me to terminate my pregnancy before I even heard a 
heartbeat. I could have saved myself months of agony, had the tests run the doctors 
wanted to run, not go through pregnancy and birth, but then I wouldn't have my 
daughter and that would be devastating. 
While I am pro life in almost all circumstances I have never felt compelled to publicly
testify on our current abortion laws. Terminating a pregnancy after 24 weeks, when 
the child can survive outside the womb is wrong. The mother still has to birth that 
child. Terminating a pregnancy due to chromosomal abnormalities is eugenics and is 
wrong. You don't need to be pro-life to know that that is a child and taking the life of 
a child when he/she can live outside the womb is wrong.
