Mike Buchanan
Brunswick
LD 1619
My name is Mike Buchanan and I’m full time resident of Brunswick. I strongly the 
committee to reject LD 1619. The mere thought of murdering a full term infant 
boggles the mind. Is this what Maine has come to? I’d this what our country has come
to?  It’s long past time to think with you conscious, your heart and good old common 
sense.
