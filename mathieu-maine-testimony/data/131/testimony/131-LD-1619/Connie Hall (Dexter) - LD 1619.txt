Madam/iviister Chairman and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Connie Hall and I live in Dexter. I am testifying today in opposition to 
LD 1619. 
if passed LD 1619 will reduce the unborn viable, vulnerable, voiceless late term to 
full term children to the class of "Subhuman “ . The children will be disposed of 
without regard to their unique and plainly visible humanity. 
There was a time in the history of this Nation when -another class of humans were 
deemed “Subhuman “ , without "rights" and without regard to their plainly visible 
humanity. These once free men, women and children were torn from their homes 
and their country to become the property of others to do with as they wished. 
These once free people were chained, whipped and treated like and worse than 
animals by those who "chose" to see them as “Subhuman “ . Their cries for mercy 
went unheard and unheeded. The power of life and death was ﬁrmly in the hands 
of those who refused to acknowledge their humanity. But there arose a group of 
people who dared to see the humanity of this class of people and they formed 
what was called the "Underground Railroad “.Thousands of slaves were freed and 
given back their rightful humanity. A bloody Civil War was fought to ﬁnally settle 
the matter, but as we all know we still live with the consequences of calling a class 
of people “Subhuman “ . We should have learned from our past, but here we are 
today. The unborn, late to full term child is not “Subhuman “ . Viable, vulnerable 
and voiceless and plainly human, its humanity can be seen, by all who chose to 
see. As a modern day Abolitionist i stand together with everyone who will dare to 
'
