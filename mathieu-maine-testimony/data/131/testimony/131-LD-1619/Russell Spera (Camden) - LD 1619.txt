LD 1619
I am opposed to LD 1619 - it is simply barbaric & gruesome - medical technology can
save the the life of mother and child at any point in late pregnancy - tearing and 
ripping apart the body of a baby is not necessary for the life of the mother.
The idea of tragic fetal disease or debilitation is usually applied if an unborn child has
Downs Syndrome - this is VERY clear in places like Scandinavia  and parts of Europe
- few children are born with Downs Syndrome - sounds like the Nazi idea of 
"cleansing: the human race.
JUST SAY NO !
