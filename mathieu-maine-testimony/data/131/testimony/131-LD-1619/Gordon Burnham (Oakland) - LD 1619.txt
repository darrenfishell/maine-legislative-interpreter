Senator Carney, Representative ivioonen, and Honorabie iviembers of the joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Gordon Burnham. I am a resident of Oakland, Maine and am here to testify in 
opposition to LD1619. 
1-, _. 
Our state has been surviving quite weii with the abortion rulings in eitect before this biil. So 
well, in fact, that our Governor, the Honorable Janet Mills, in her campaign for her second term 
acknowledged there was no need to expand abortion rights. 
At this time, abortions are permitted up to the gestational time of viability which is considered 
to be 22-23 weeks.l'l1.e\,1 are also only legally allowed to be performed by a licensed health care 
professional. 
LD1619 would allow the life of a viable child to be taken from it until the time of birth and as 
worded could take place in the birth canal itself. it also removes any penalty for the taking of 
this life. This is barbaric. Once the penalty is removed, what will impede any individual from 
performing this sanctiﬁed, for lack of a better term, murder. 
l served in the military 28 V2 years of my life to ensure that people in this country and especially 
this state would enjoy their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness which the 
Preamble to the Declaration of independence states are unalienable. Although not legally 
binding, the Oeciaration states the principies on which our government, and our identity as 
Americans, are based. 
in Maine, we cannot freely distribute disposable grocery bags. Are we going to freely dispose of 
life? 
this bill lS extreme and out of character with the image many would prefer iviaine to put forth. 
Thank you for your time and attention and I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass.

Gordon Burnham, Oakland, Maine
