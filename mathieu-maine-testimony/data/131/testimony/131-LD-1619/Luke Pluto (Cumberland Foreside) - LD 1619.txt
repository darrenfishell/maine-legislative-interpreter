Luke Pluto
Cumberland Foreside
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee:  
My name is Luke A Pluto, from Cumberland Foreside, ME.  I oppose LD 1619, The 
Late Term Abortion Bill, also called An Act to Improve Maineâ€™s Reproductive 
Privacy Laws.
Whereas life begins at conception, abortion is wrong.  To end the life of a viable 
human up to the time of delivery is particularly wrong.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote No on LD 1619.  Thank you!
