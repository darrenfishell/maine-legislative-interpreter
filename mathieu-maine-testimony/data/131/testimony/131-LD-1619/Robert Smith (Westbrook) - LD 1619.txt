LD 1619
Greeting:
I wish to express my opposition to LD 1619.  This bill ignores the viability of the 
developing child and instead replaces it with a subjective decision of "when it is 
necessary".  Necessary for what and necessary for whom.  
The State of Maine has an obligation to protect the most vulnerable.  It is without 
question that today the most vulnerable are the unborn. Who speaks for them? 
Certainly not the sponsors of this bill.
