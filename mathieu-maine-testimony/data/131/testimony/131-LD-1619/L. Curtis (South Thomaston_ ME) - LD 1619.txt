LD 1619
I am a mother who works full time, and regret I cannot attend in person today.  I 
oppose LD1619.  Maine law permits abortions from conception to viability for any 
reason, and from viability to birth to save or preserve the health and life of the 
mother.   I am angry at the party for bringing up this bill, playing on the fears and 
passions, and attempting to unsettle settled law, so that it can run 30 second attack ads
in the next round of elections against its independent and GOP opponents of office, 
who oppose partial birth and late term abortions for legitimate ethical reasons. In 
industrialized nations across the globe, adults are expressing regret that they had no 
children, or fewer children than they had wished, citing depressed wages, and rising 
home prices, among other reasons that made them feel they were financially forced to 
have fewer children than they want.   To my mind, LD1619 is not chiefly about 
helping women, or families, and certainly its not about helping children.  Maine law 
already has a law that permits abortion for health and life of the mother at any time 
during the pregnancy.  This bill is  chiefly about helping one party play on public 
passions to secure votes in the next round of elections.
