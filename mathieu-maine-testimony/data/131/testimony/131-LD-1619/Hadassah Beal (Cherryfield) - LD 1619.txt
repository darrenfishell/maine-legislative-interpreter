Testimony of Hadassah P. Beal 
--In Opposition of LD 1619-- 
An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on Judiciary, I am 
Hadassah Beal of Chenyﬁeld, Maine, and I am here in strong opposition of LD 1619, An Act to Improve 
Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. 
As a Christian, I ﬁrmly believe that life is a precious gift from God, and it is my duty to stand up and 
protect life from the day of conception until natural death. An unborn baby is not just a clump of cells or a blob 
of fetal tissue‘ . From the moment of conception, he or she is a human being created in the image of God. 
According to the Maine Right to Life 2022 Annual Report’ , an average of 39.7 abortions are 
committed Weekly in Maine, which is an estimated 2,064 innocent lives lost yearly from abortion. Maine 
should not join the six other states that have no restrictions on abortion. It is important that we also consider 
Where the passing of such a bill could lead us to. Where are we going to draw the line? 
Every one of us in this room has been given the precious gift of life. For most of us, our parents 
sacriﬁced themselves to provide for us, care for us, love us, and give us the best childhoods they could. Many 
proponents of abortion have children and grandchildren of their own, whom they love and are proud of’ , so 
why would they want to kill the next generations intentionally? Already so much damage has been done, and 
our nation is suffering greatly because we have allowed this unthinkable sin in our land. How many of the last 
three generations are missing because mothers did not embrace motherhood and cherish the gift of life 
growing within them? 
I believe Governor Mills lied to Mainers when she ran for re-election, vowing not to expand abortion 
in Maine.‘ I understand that this bill has been brought forth, using the story of Dana Peirce,5 who travelled out 
of state to get an abortion after the doctor told her her son had skeletal dysplasia. I have never had a child, soI 
cannot imagine the pain, grief, and questions a mother would have upon hearing such news. But, I do know 
that God, the Creator of life, knows the entire life story of every human being, even before they are born, as 
stated in Jeremiah. Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb 
I sanctified thee.‘ 
Just as you and I were created for a purpose, each little unborn baby has also been created fora 
speciﬁc purpose, and we are taking away not only their God-given right to life, but their rights as a citizen of 
Maine. 
Maine law states in Section 6-A: Discrimination against persons prohibited. N0 person shall be deprived of 
life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be 
denied the enjoyment of that person ’s civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof7 
I know some will think it too harsh to state the following, but we must face this issue and call sin 
exactly what it is: 
Abortion at any stage of pregnancy, or at birth, is murder, and it is destroying our families, our future, 
our state, and our nation. 
I respectfully urge you to please vote “No” on LD 1619. Thank you for your time, and please know 
you are all in my prayers.
