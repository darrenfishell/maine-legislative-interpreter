To the Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Gary Gould, and I reside in Winterport, Maine.
I am writing this letter in opposition to LD  1619. I am sixty-nine years old. I never thought, that
in my lifetime, I would have to be writing in opposition to proposed legislation legalizing the
destruction of human life, up to birth.
I can remember, when the whole idea of legalizing abortion was being pushed, in the `60s and
`70s. Some of the arguments being used in favor of it at the time were to make it "safe, legal, and rare."
This legislation, if passed, destroys the argument of "safe," by reducing restrictions of who can perform
abortions, and the penalties on illegal abortions. As for the "legal" part, the state of Maine, shamefully,
already has one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country. The Supreme Court decision did not
change that, it only made it a state matter. As for rarity, this legislation makes an act, that used to
supposedly be for emergency situations such as rape, incest, or severe health problems of the mother,
into a matter of convenience or whim, up to birth.
It is sad that, in this country5 the importance of human life has been downgraded, especially` for
the defenseless. We used to look at other countries that had little regard for life as uncivilized, and
backward. Now it appears that we are catching up to them.
I would ask that you would please find LD  1619 ought not to pass.
Thank you for your consideration.
