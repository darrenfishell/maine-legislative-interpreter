LD 1619
I am not against abortion entirely so I am definitely not an extremist. In the case of 
harm to the mother or rape or incest I see abortion as a viable option for women. 
What I do not support is abortion on demand and/or taxpayer money funding 
abortions because the woman simply chooses to not have a child. In a free country 
people should have to face the consequences of their actions. To the extent that 
abortion can be legislated at all (knowing in the past abortions were done illegally 
anyway), I am opposed to LD 1619 as it allows abortions of a viable living being, and
can even increase the chances of a woman aborting the child right before birth simply 
due to last minute panic. Just seems like senseless murder to me. Can't we, as a 
community, come with better tax funded options? After all, if the woman is about to 
give birth anyway, can't there be a more compassionate way to support the woman? 
Agencies could be better funded to help give support. It is about life after all, for both 
the mother and child.
