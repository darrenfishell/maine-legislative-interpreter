Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Ryan Hastey and I am a 
resident of Sullivan. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619.  This bill to allow an abortion up to 
the point of birth for any reason a medical provider finds necessary is deeply concerning.  Why strike the 
language of “to preserve the life or health of the mother”?  This virtually allows any reason a medical 
provider comes up with to perform an abortion on a fetus that is viable outside the womb. This is 
murder and it is morally wrong.  There is no argument that would convince me that this bill is the right 
way forward for the State of Maine. I believe all unborn babies have the right to life and should not be 
terminated.  This proposed bill erodes any rights that the unborn have remaining in the State of Maine.  
I find any politician that supports this bill to be guilty of innocent bloodshed.  Instead the State of Maine 
should be legislating more resources to be available to promote adoption, fostering, domestic violence 
reduction, and supporting pregnancy crisis centers that do not promote abortion.  Thank you for your 
time and attention to my concern.
