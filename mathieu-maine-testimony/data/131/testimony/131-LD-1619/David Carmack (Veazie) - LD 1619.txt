LD 1619
Dear Maine Representatives and Senators,
Thank you for your service to our residents of Maine. Your willingness to run for and 
serve in public office is admirable and truly respected by me. I am writing you today 
to ask that you vote “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1619. As a physician in Maine, I do 
greatly respect life at all stages. I realize that as Mainers and Americans, we will need
to come together to determine when life “begins” and this will not be easy, but we can
do it. In my opinion, LD 1619 goes too far with allowing abortion up to the time of 
birth. Thank you for considering my request.
Sincerely,
Dave
