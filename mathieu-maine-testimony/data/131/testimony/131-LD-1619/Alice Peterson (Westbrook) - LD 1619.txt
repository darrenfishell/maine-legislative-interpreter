LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and members of the judiciary committee,
my name is Alice Peterson, and I live in Westbrook.
I am deeply troubled about LD 1619. As a woman who grew up in the 60s and 70s, 
the struggle for women’s rights has always been in my consciousness. Abortion is 
spoken of as a women’s rights issue; However I cannot consider abortion to be 
primarily an issue of women’s rights as long as the rights of unborn women are not 
considered as part of the equation. Current abortion law in Maine allows for abortion 
after viability when considered necessary for the life or health of the mother.  
Opening the door to abortion after viability for any other reason is extreme and is a 
step that our government should NOT take.  I cannot see how ending the life of a 
being who could survive outside the mother can be justified other than to save the life 
of the mother.  I can’t see how other Mainers, whether pro-choice or pro-life, can 
justify this extreme action, or support this extreme bill.
I’m not a political activist in any sense of the word and am not aligned with a political
party. But I can’t avoid speaking up on this.  I oppose this bill, and ask you to please, 
please reject LD 1619.
Sincerely,
Alice Peterson
