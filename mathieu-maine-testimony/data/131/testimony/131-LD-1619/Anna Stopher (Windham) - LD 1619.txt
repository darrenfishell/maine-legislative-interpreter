Good afternoon Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Anna Stopher andl 
am a resident of Windham. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
This bill is dangerous and reckless for a few reasons. First, Maine's current reproductive laws cover the medical 
necessity for abortion by a licensed professional for reasons where the mother is at risk, or the baby is no longer 
viable. While I do not support abortion, the option is already there for those who choose to abort. 
Secondly, l am very concerned about Maine's future. Passing LD 1619 would mean Maine would have one of the 
most extreme abortion laws in the country and I am concerned Maine would see a sharp increase in abortion 
tourism. As a resident of Maine, I want people to come to Maine for vacation and rest. Not abortion. Let's choose 
LIFE over money. 
Third and most importantly, this bill is not a solution to the fundamental issue at hand. We must focus on 
providing resources, guidance, compassion, and love to those who may ﬁnd themselves in a situation where they 
are pregnant. We need to empathize and understand why so many are opting for abortion. ls it the uncertainty of 
the future? ls it because they do not feel ready? ls it because they have lost hope? I'm here to tell you there is still 
hope, a hope that is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. 
We must show up and ﬁght for the next generation, so they can have a voice too. if we don't, Maine will have no 
next generation. 
Listen to the majority of Mainers and vote NO on LD 1619. 
Thank you. 
Anna Stopher 
Windham, Maine
