LD 1619
I am submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 1619.  Removing reasonable 
limitations on when an abortion can be performed is both immoral and unethical.  The
sanctity of life should not be limited to individuals who have been "born".  Unborn 
children need legal protection because they do not have the ability to speak for 
themselves.  The rights of women do not negate the rights of the unborn fetus.  Every 
effort should be made to assist women with unwanted pregnancies but this does not 
include terminating the life of the unborn.
