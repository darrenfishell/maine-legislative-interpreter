Patrick Finn
Lewiston
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Father Patrick Finn. I am a Catholic priest serving in Lewiston, Lisbon, 
and Sabattus. Abortion at any stage is clearly the killing of a human being at its 
smallest and most fragile. It is enough of a horrendous shame that Maine allows legal 
access to abortion at all; we must not expand access to abortion, which is never a 
solution. We must never let Maine become a destination for death. 
Life is worthy of protection at every stage. I implore you to oppose LD 1619 and the 
other related bills.
