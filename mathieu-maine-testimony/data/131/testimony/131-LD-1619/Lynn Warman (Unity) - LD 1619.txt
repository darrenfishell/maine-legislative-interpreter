My name is Lynn Warman, and I am from Unity, Maine. I am a mother of three happy and successful 
children and a grandmother of twelve. I had the privilege of attending seven of my grandchildren ’s 
births, including three premies. It truly sickens me to think of a child being aborted. The Bible clearly 
states that a baby is a human being, made in God's image from the moment of conception. To murdera 
baby in the womb makes you no better than the man that stabbed the minor on the street in Bangor 
last week, or the man who shot those four people in Bowdoin. 
Babies are in their mother’s womb, but they are not a part oftheir mother's body. They are a life unto 
themselves. Science has proven that each one has its own DNA at conception. When our little Azalia 
was born, her head popped out, but her shoulders were stuck. The doctor quickly pushed my 
daughter's legs up and moved her hips until Azalia's shoulders and body came out. Azalia was mad at 
the world, screaming at all of us for the awful situation that she had been through. These babies feel 
pain! They have emotions and feelings! They feel the terrible pain involved with literally being torn 
apart and being vacuumed out of the womb. What kind of society are we that would so harm the most 
vulnerable and innocent among us? 
I conclude with the fact that those of us with children do not wish to be seen by doctors and nurses that 
are in the business of aborting babies, nor do we want medical care from those institutions that would 
mutilate young people. Please do not pass LD 1619, which I believe that a majority of Mainers do not 
support. Thank you.
