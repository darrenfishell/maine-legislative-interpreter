Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Elise A. Rossignol and I live in Oakland, Maine. Please oppose LD1619. 
It is unimaginable to me that we would consider taking the life of a pre born at the 
late stage of pregnancy. The pain and torture the child will be exposed to is not 
consistent to Maine values to live a full and peace filled life. Many civilized countries
have changed their abortion laws to much few weeks allowed for abortions to happen.
This bill is too extreme for me to agree to.  Thank you for allowing me to share my 
view.
Respectfully submitted,
Elise A. Rossignol
