LD 1619
  I am a moderate registered Democrat and lean strongly toward the more 
compassionate agenda of the Democratic Party, including women's rights. However, I
cannot support the total disregard for the inalienable constitutional right to life of 
innocent, helpless children in the womb. Abortion is not a right! It is the 
dismemberment or other means of killing developing human beings. There are other 
ways to deal with unexpected or unwanted pregnancies.
  Now LD 1619 seeks to extend this gruesome, inhumane practice to viability for 
ANY reason deemed "necessary" in the professional judgement of a licensed 
physician, and affirms that an abortion may be performed only by a person licensed in
the State as a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse. 
Even worse, it illogically deletes the clause that any person not so licensed who 
knowingly performs or assists in an abortion is guilty of a Class C crime. This gives 
abortion facilities unlimited control of abortions without input from anyone else!
  I strongly urge all legislators voting on this, regardless of party affiliation, vote with 
their consciences to defeat this controversial, unacceptable amendment.
