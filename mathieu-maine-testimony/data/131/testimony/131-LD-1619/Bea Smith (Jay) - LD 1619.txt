Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Judiciary 
Committee.- 
My name is Bea Smith I'm a resident ofJay Maine i am a devout Catholic and l come to oppose 
LD1619. 
My God, it is the agonizing Jesus Christ who died on the cross for the love of you and this is 
how you repay him for his love towards you? 
By killing his innocent children. 
He said, let the little children come unto me he didn't say kill babies first. 
The Ten Commandments said do not kill. 
in the Bible, the Good Samaritan who took good care of the man dying on the street went to 
heaven. 
But all the others who just walked by went to hell because they didn't care for others. 
Now it's your time for you to think about your future, where are all of you going? 
ls it Heaven or Hell, remember you are all making that decision right Here and now. 
Our parents went to war and died for our freedom, not so we could kill our children and 
grandchildren. 
l'm so ashamed of American people who only think ofthemselves, they only have sex and kill 
the children that your lovemaking made. 
Your children are God's greatest gift for you but remember to stand up tall and be proud of 
yourself for killing innocent children. 
I'll be standing with my God when you make your decision. 
Take time to smell the roses because there are no roses in hell and no way out. 
This is the choice you are making not us. 
Please make the right decision before it's too late. 
ln God's Holy name we pray have mercy on our children. _
