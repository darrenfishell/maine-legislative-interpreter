Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Michaela Thibodeau. I am a Richmond resident, mother to 2 children (one still 
residing in my womb), and a registered nurse in this great state. l'm here to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619. 
l have cared for children born as young as 23 weeks gestation and amazing geriatric patients of 
the prime age of 105. One thing they absolutely have in common is they are very much alive. 
Maybe different sizes, different abilities, different memories, but they are alive human beings 
nonetheless. 
I am here today to implore you as our ambassadors for law making to put a stop to this 
proposed piece of legislation that would expand abortion completely unnecessarily. With the 
gremotra of an “age of viability clause" , Maine would be devaluing the life of its youngest and 
"5Fr?;§€t/i \/ignerable citizens, both children and mothers. 
Please hear me: There is no medical reason to abort and remove a child who with 
medical assistance could absolutely survive and thrive if delivered prematurely. And ifa 
child is predicted not predicted to live due to congenital defects, there is no reasona 
birth with humane hospice measures could not be performed. 
Expanding abortion in our state does not assist in growing our population, does not allow Maine 
citizens the opportunity to individually “|ove their neighbor ’ by supporting pregnant mom’s in 
need, and puts an unbearable burden on the consciences of nurses, doctors, and other health 
care workers who disagree with late term abortions. 
For this reason and many others, LD-1619 must be voted down for the well-being of Maine 
citizens. Vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS. Thank you.
