LD 1619
(L.D. 1619)    Bill "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws"
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary:
“I’ve noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.” --Ronald 
Reagan
I feel that abortion is wrong for the same reason that I feel like killing anybody is 
wrong.  A tiny living human with its own DNA should be protected, not harmed.  As 
a father, it sickens me that there are hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in 
this country every year.  Maine should not be a part of that.  We value life and not 
death.  Maine should be putting its resources into protecting children.  Maine should 
also put resources into helping people understand that there are other ways to prevent 
unwanted pregnancies.  We need to stop aborting our children—America is already 
below replacement rates which will cause all kinds of problems in the future.  Please 
vote “Ought not to Pass” on LD 1619 and protect our children.
