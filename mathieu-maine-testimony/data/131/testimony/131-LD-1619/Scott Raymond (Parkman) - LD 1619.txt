LD 1619
I am writing about my concerns with LD1619.  I am a devout Christian, but the Maine
council of Churches does not speak for me!  Here are just some of my concerns…
First of all, killing a baby in the womb is murder. It’s not just a clump of cells, it is a 
developing baby. Without going deeper, the current law stops abortion once the baby 
is “viable”, which means that it can survive outside the womb. Killing it at this point 
is certainly murder.  
Second, removing the requirement for doctors to perform this ”procedure “ will put 
many women at risk for complications possibly resulting in injury to her body or even
death. 
Additionally, many, many women suffer emotionally the rest of their lives after 
having an abortion.  Abortion facilities are “in the game” to make money.  They 
manipulate women to have abortions while minimizing the possible risks and 
emotional trauma abortions can cause.
Some people will say that this is a woman’s rights issue. It’s her body they will say. 
Well, what about the right of these developing babies?  If they were able to 
understand that they were about to be killed and they were able to speak, I’m sure 
they would say that they want to live!!!  Their rights are being taken away. This bill 
would take away their right to live!  We need to protect the innocent. You don’t get 
any more innocent than a baby in the womb.  No one in their right mind wants to die a
premature death, but some think they have a right to kill the innocent!  It defies logic 
to think that killing of the innocent is morally right!
For these reasons, I urge the legislators to vote down this bill and put an end to the 
lunacy of killing innocent babies!
