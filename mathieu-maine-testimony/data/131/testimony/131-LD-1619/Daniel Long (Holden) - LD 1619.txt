Daniel Long
Holden
LD 1619
My name is Daniel Long. I was born in Maine, and live in Holden, Maine. I'm writing
to you with respect to the late term abortion bill LD 1619.
I'm speaking up on behalf of the voiceless. As such, I oppose expanding abortion 
access up to the point of birth. I believe human life begins at conception, and because 
I hear some woman saying, "My body, my right", I wonder, what about the baby's 
rights? Where is the baby's equal protection under the law? How can we consider 
certain rights for one person, when denying those same rights to another?
I'm speaking up to defend the voiceless by opposing LD 1619, a bill which expands 
abortion access to the point of birth, which is clearly murder.
My ability to offer this opinion to you for your purposes of representing the people of 
Maine is evidence that our liberty still stands, so I'm grateful for the opportunity.
