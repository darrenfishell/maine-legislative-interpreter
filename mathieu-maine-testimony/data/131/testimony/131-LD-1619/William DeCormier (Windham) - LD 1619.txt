I believe this is an excessive expansion of abortion Law. Every time a child grows in 
womb the Lord creates a soul. No man or woman has the right to Abort this child. 
Certainly not after the point of viability. It used to be said the abortion should be safe 
and rare. Why are keeping the abortions  secret from the parents and the father? Why 
is the Health of the mother no longer a concern. By eliminating penalties for 
unlicensed persons to perform abortions arenâ€™t we allowing unlicensed abortions to 
happen. This bill has too many intentional loop holes that both endanger the mother 
destroy a viable child and deny the father any rights
