Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Cyndi Hutchison, and l’m a resident of Benton, Maine. I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. l am the mother of three, and grandmother of four, soon to be seven, 
grandchildren. Our daughter and her family are in the processing of adopting three children. 
Two of our children came to us through birth and one through adoption. Our son who was 
adopted was born with physical and mental disabilities. If abortion had been more readily 
available when he was born, his birth mother would have chosen to end his life. She carried him 
to birth and for that we are thankful. Life comes with challenges, and his life was no different. 
Through these challenges he grew, and those of us who knew him grew. Our lives, and the lives 
of others who knew him were better for having known him. He loved life. 
Embryo adoption brought two of our grandchildren into our family. After more than a decade of 
infertility, our son and his wife adopted fifteen embryos. These microscopic babies were frozen 
at less than a week old, fully formed unique individuals, ready to grow in another woman’s 
womb. They were left on ice by another couple who had completed their family, but had these 
embryos, babies to share with other adoptive families. 
My heart breaks for mothers and fathers who do not understand that the fetus growing within the 
womb is a fully human being. When l was having babies in the 1980’s I did not have any of the 
technology to show me the child developing within. Now we have ultrasound photo shoots that 
help us to see that tiny child's development. 
Please stop LD1619 to save the lives of babies, save their mothers and fathers from the burden 
of ending the life of their child. Nine months is a short time to carry a child. Many resources are 
available to help parents choose life. Please vote ought not to pass.
