LD 1619

Dear Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Valerie Nightingale and I live in Stockton Springs Maine.
I am testifying today in opposition to bill LD1619 Governorâ€™s bill to permit late term 
abortion for any reason.
Please oppose this bill! Information indicates that over 65% of Mainers do not want 
late term or no limits abortion of which I am definitely one!
My nephew, born in the state of Maine with Spina Bifida and might have been 
aborted as advised, was allowed to be born. He now will be Keynote speaker at USM 
Augusta this year, because of his accomplishments growing up in a wheel chair!
As a mother and grandmother I beg our Representatives to vote NO to this bill 
LD1619, allow our new citizens to be born and grow up to make Maine and even 
better state.
