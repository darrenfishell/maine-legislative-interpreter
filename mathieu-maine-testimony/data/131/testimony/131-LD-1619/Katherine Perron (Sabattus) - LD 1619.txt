On January 10"‘ , Amandi Omokore- Allen celebrated his first birthday! When he 
was born, he weighed 1 pound 5 ounces and was given a 10% chance of survival. 
After spending 155 days in a NICU, he went home. He was only slightly more than 
halfway through a typical gestation period of 40 weeks. Amandi now weighs 
almost 21lbs! 
Jari Lopez was born at 11.5 ounces. Doctors gave him a 30% chance of survival. He 
was born at 24 weeks gestation and remained in the NICU for 127 days. On his first 
birthday, he weighed 16 lbs! 
l sh are these fantasti-"c -"storries with you to show the -v-ia~b~i~l-i-ty -of a -baby is nota 
doctor's determination. These children survived well before the 40 weeks of 
gestation. 
Current Maine law allows abortion up until the fetus is viable, which is normally 
about 2'2-24 weeks. The law also states, andf 
l quote: "After viability, an abortion 
may be performed only when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the 
mother. State statute defines viability as when the life of the fetus may be 
continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life support." End 
quote 
This proposed bill goes too far and is NOT in the best interest of Maine. Babies can 
and HAVE survived ~befor-e the 22-24 weeks gestation as l’ -ve shared. We need to 
protect all children. l have a picture of our grandson when he was 24 weeks old in 
gestation. He will be born at the end of this month. He is beautiful in this picture 
and we can't wait to meet him! 
Thank you for serving and may God richly bless you as you seek to do His will for 
the people of l\/laine.
