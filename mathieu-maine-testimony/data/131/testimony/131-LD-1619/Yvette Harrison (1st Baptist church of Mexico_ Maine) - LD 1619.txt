My name is Yvette Harrison.  I am a resident of Rumford, Maine.  I am here to testify
that I am against LD1619.  I believe that killing innocent babies is atrocious.  I 
believe we should stand up for what is right.  Let's make this country a better place.  
Psalm 127:3  "Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from Him."
