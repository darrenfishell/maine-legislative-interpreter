LD 1619
Dear Representatives,
When I first heard about LD1619 I became nauseas at the thought of extinguishing 
the life of a viable baby in the womb. How is this not murder? If a baby is delivered at
7 or 8 months gestation,  hospitals take every measure to save that life. Why don't 
they just let the baby die? 
Do you wish you had never been born? Do you wish you had been aborted prior to 
birth? How can you allow that decision to be made for a full term baby? Do you wish 
that decision had been made about your life?
I have a friend who's in her mid-twenties, left of center and pro-abortion. When I 
mentioned this bill to her, she was aghast, speechless. When she collected herself she 
said, "that's too much". She's right, LD1619 is too much and it goes to far under the 
guise of women's rights. 
Vote to kill this bill, not viable babies.
