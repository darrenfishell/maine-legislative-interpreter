LD 1619 
“Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.” Jeremiah 1:5 
“You created my inmost being; 
you knit me together in my mother’s womb. 
So says the Creator of Heaven and Earth 
I praise you because I am wonderfully made; 
awesome are your works 
My body was not hidden from you 
when I was being made in secret. 
When I was Woven together in the depths of the earth, 
you saw me in the womb. 
My life was fashioned before it came into being.” Psalm 139 
I am a practicing Catholic. The Catholic Church does not and never will support 
the killing of the unborn during the ﬁrst, second or third trimester. The developing 
life in the womb is sacred. There are 2000+ daily abortions in the U.S. 5% are for 
rap e. 0.5 for nicest. There are 64.3 million p eople missing from our numbers since 
1973. That includes Engineers, Doctors, Surgeons, Researchers, Scientists, 
Psychologists,Chaplains,Professional Athletes, Medical workers, Teachers, Fire 
Fighters, Police Ofﬁcers . . . to name a few? 
Since 1973 , we Catholics have been praying for a change of hearts andminds. God 
answered our prayers on June 24, 2022. Do you think it wise to contravene on 
God’s answer to our prayers? Do not sign this barbaric and inhumane LD 1619 
into Law. As the innocent and sinless Christ said ﬁom the cross, "Father forgive 
them, for they know not what they do.
