LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
My name is Sue Clark - born & raised in Maine. I received my education here and 
have worked as an R.N. in Maine hospitals and schools for over 50 years.
I am a mother of two grown children and have four grandchildren.
I love the State of Maine and the wonderful life my family and I have had here.
I must speak out at this time to STRONGLY OPPOSE the LD 1619 proposal.
This is an EXTREME bill that allows for the intentional killing of full term babies 
without restriction.
The proposed bill removes viability restrictions and expands abortion access up to the 
time of birth.
It also removes penalties for unlicensed persons performing abortions. Why?
Aborting full term children is not a reflection of the values of most Maine people, 
Mainers are known for their care & concern for others, especially the most vulnerable.
I speak up for the health & safety of our most vulnerable - the child in the womb who 
has no voice.
There should be greater restrictions on abortion not fewer.
Please vote NO! Thank you.
