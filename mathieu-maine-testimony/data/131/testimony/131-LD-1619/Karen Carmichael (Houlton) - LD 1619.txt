LD 1619
Dear Senators and Representatives,
     I am writing to let you know why I oppose LD 1619.  My husband and I were 
parents to a premature baby.  He was born at 33 weeks and spent 2 weeks in the 
hospital and then came home.  He did not have any serious health issues as a result of 
his prematurity.  Under this law, our baby could have been aborted.  I can not even 
imagine this!  How can Maine pass a bill where babies can be killed that could 
survive outside of the womb?  Abortion at ANY time for ANY reason is too extreme 
for Maine!  If this bill passes, Maine would have one of the most extreme abortion 
laws in the country!  I would not want the state that I call home to be characterized 
this way.  Maine's current law also covers abortion for medical necessity.  
     In closing, I am against abortion and don't feel that this law is needed.  Thank you 
for taking the time to read my testimony.
