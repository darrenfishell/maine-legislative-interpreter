Armelle Sigaud
Rockland
LD 1619
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Armelle Sigaud. I live in Rockland and I come before you today to ask 
you to vote "ought NOT to pass" on LD 1619.
LD 1619 would allow pregnant mothers to abort their child until a few moments 
before that little girl or that little boy, fully formed, fully viable, would have been 
born. This is what this bill is about. Do you think that is extreme?
Then you are not alone. According to a poll published by Pew Research a few months
ago, 80% of voting-age Americans support some limitations on abortion. Yet these 
limitations may soon vanish in Maine, as they already have in Vermont, New Mexico,
Oregon, and Washington, DC. 
Did you know that right now, abortion in Maine is already available on demand, 
anytime, without a medical reason, until a baby reaches viability, i.e., approximately 
24 weeks? 
LD 1619 empowers the abortionist to justify any abortion after viability. At that stage 
of pregnancy, the only way to get rid of that little girl or that little boy is to crush the 
baby's skull and cut the rest of the baby's body apart, one leg, one arm at a time, until 
the child's precious little limbs can be extracted and discarded.  
Today I ask you to reflect: Would we treat puppies or kittens that way?    
Is this what we want Maine to be known for? Is this "the way life should be"? 
Who will stand up to defend the right to life of voiceless, innocent, preborn children? 
A human being at any stage of pregnancy is a tiny one of us and needs love, not 
death. We have looked the other way long enough. 
Life is a Gift. Time to be brave! Please vote NO on LD 1619. 
Thank you.
