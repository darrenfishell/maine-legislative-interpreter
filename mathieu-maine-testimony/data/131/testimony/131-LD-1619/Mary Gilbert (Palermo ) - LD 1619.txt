Mary Gilbert
Palermo 
LD 1619
My name is Mary Gilbert and I am a mother of 5 from Palermo.  I oppose LD 1619 as
abortion at ANY time and for ANY reason is too extreme and is absolutely wrong for 
Maine.  Maine cannot be "the way life should be" when the unborn, even those 
completely able to survive outside the womb, are legally murdered and discarded as 
trash. Please remember, without the right to life, no other human right matters.   
Thank you for your time, and be thankful your mother chose life.
