LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair and Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Pamela Ring and I live in Woodland. I am submitting written  testimony 
today in opposition of LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy 
Laws.
I have had the privelege of seeing two babies born prematurely at 24 weeks and not 
only survive but thrive. They are both healthy individuals with may gifts and talents 
to offer and have had a positive impact on their community and countless number of 
people. Every unborn baby should be given this same oppoprtunity. 
The statistics show that 2/3 of Mainers don't agree with late-term abortion. As 
representatives of the people, you are obligated to vote accordingly.
Please oppose this drastic bill that the greatest percentage of Mainers do not want to 
see pass. Thank you.
