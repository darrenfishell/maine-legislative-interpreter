LD 1619
Hello, My name is Erik, a Maine Native living with my family of 5 in Readfield, and 
I am writing to you tonight in prayer that you stop LD1619, the proposed change to 
Maine's current abortion law. If passed through, LD1619 would cause Maine to have 
one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country and would allow a baby 
who could survive inside or outside the womb to be killed. This is murder no matter 
how you look at it. Maine should celebrate life and protect it, not make it okay to 
destroy it. "Medical necessity" (I would of lost both my Wife and my lost/unborn 
child during her ectopic pregnancy if the current law wasn't in place at the time) is 
already covered by our current law which protects life as much as medically possible 
but this change in the law will not protect life in our state, it would only further allow 
the taking of life. Please, please, please find it in your heart and soul to know that this 
change, LD1619, is bad for the people in Maine and the lives we should protect. 
Please be a positive example for our state and the rest of the country that Maine 
supports life and that we will do everything in our power to not take life away. Thank 
you and may God bless your heart in this difficult time in your life.
‚úù Respectful, Erik Parker
