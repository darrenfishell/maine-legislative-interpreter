LD 1619
I am writing to oppose the passage of LD 1619. This bill allows for extraordinary 
measures in ending the life of unborn babies right up to the moment of birth. We have
gone so far beyond the original idea of "safe and rare" abortions in addition, this bill 
is not supported by the majority of Mainers. I love the State of Maine and don't want 
it associated with the most liberal and extreme abortion laws in the country.
