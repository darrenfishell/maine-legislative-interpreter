LD 1619
Please consider being on the right-side of history with your decision to abolish 
LD1619. Every person considering passage of this bill came from the womb. 
Regardless of how we want to define personhood on our modern day society, it is an 
indisputable fact that the womb is where the beginning stage of life happens. The 
womb is the initial source of growth, development and nourishment for a person, no 
different than what a person needs after birth out of the womb. When we consider 
“choice”, I often wonder who exactly has the right to choose on behalf of the person 
being considered for abortion. What’s next I ask you?  Are we to expect another bill 
allowing termination of life after birth for, say, 3 days in case we don’t like the color 
of the baby’s eyes? Perhaps 10 days, in case we don’t like how much the baby cries? 
Perhaps 1 year in case the baby isn’t walking fast enough? 
I love the State of Maine, however, I am deeply disturbed that we are moving in the 
wrong direction on the issue of abortion.  There is no one of right-mind that can 
convince me that your conscious is telling you that a late-term abortion, of a fully 
developed baby capable of living out of the womb, is the right thing to do. 
It is not too late to do the right thing and protect life.
