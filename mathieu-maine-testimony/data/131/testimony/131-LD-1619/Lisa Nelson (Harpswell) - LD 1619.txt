I just had another conversation that is wholly common these days in restaurants and 
retail establishments: customer and clerk bemoaning the fact that businesses are 
understaffed.
There may be many reasons for these shortages but consider this one: abortion. 
According to the Guttmacher institute there have been 63 million abortions since 
1973. Divide this by 50 states and on average, we are missing 1,200,000 persons per 
state. This number is just shy of our population in Maine. Imagine if our population 
were doubled now. Would we be having these routine conversations? Or would we be
fully staffed and not looking to attract European kids to work the coastal restaurants 
so vital to tourism? And not to be crass and frame the value of persons in terms of 
economics only, but we would have the talent, vision, and problem-solving skills of 
1,200,000 more citizens. Surely it is people who innovate and dream and solve 
problems? Therefore, aren’t people the solution and not the problem?
Governor Mills wants to increase the window of time to threaten the next generation 
of Mainers through late term abortion. Mother Teresa said a nation that kills its 
children is a nation without hope. Are we a state without hope? Don’t we want more 
Mainers than not? There are many supports for moms and unborn children in our 
state. Let us lean on them and not resort to deadly violence to solve the “problem” of 
an unintended pregnancy. 
Please vote no on LD 1619.
