Dear Sirs/Mesdames,
My mother is my hero.
When she was expecting me at age 40 in 1950, the doctors told her not to have me 
because they found a tumor in her and wanted to take care of it right away. But my 
mother Felicia said “no, I’m going to have the baby”. She then told me that she lost 
30 pounds on the day I was born, between having me and having the tumor operation,
and that it took her 8 years to feel right again. Then she said “you saved my life, 
because if I wasn’t going to have you, they wouldn’t have found the tumor”.
After I thought about what she said, I was so impressed with how she thought of 
others instead of herself that she became my hero not only because she risked her life 
to have me, but because of her attitude and outlook.
Does anyone else have the courage to be someone’s hero?
