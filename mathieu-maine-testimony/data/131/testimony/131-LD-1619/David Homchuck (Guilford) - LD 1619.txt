David Homchuck
Guilford
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Michelle Homchuck and I am a 
resident of Guilford. I am writing to testify in opposition to LD 1619.
As I sit here, I am holding my precious 8-week-old granddaughter.  Her life and 
EVERY life has value.  
We already allow abortion in Maine when medically necessary.  Please do NOT pass 
LD 1619.  Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine.  This bill
would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed.  EVERY life is 
valuable.  We should not allow Maine to have one of the most extreme abortion laws 
in the entire country.  Please do not pass this bill.
