LD 1619
Honorable Speaker Talbot-Ross. We urge that you vote “NO” on LD 1619, “An Act 
to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws.” Terminating a pregnancy in the 
delivery room is murder, pure and simple.  To do this you have to go out of your way 
and actively destroy a live baby in the birth canal by jamming a corkscrew into the 
skull and sucking out the brains. Philadephia’s friendly neighborhood abortionist, Dr. 
Kermit Gosnell, accomplished the same thing by cutting a newborn’s  spinal cord 
with a scissor.  When authorities raided his little house of horrors, they found ten full 
term mutilated babies in his freezer. He’s now serving life in prison without bail. This
bill sets us up for more of the same. What kind of a society condones killing its 
babies?  Preventing conception with a condom is one thing, preventing implantation 
of a fertilized egg with the after morning pill is another, and getting rid of a “tumor” 
or clump of cells in the womb before detecting a heartbeat can probably also be 
justified. But the pro-choice people keep moving the ghoul posts.  When the baby 
waves back during his ultrasound, you’ve probably waited too long for his abortion.  
Terminating a pregnancy in the birth canal is infanticide. If you pass this legislation, 
you’re telling the world the spirit of Joseph Mengele is alive and well and living in 
Maine.  Please reconsider your sponsorship of this legislation. Please, Vote “NO” on 
LD 1619.
Respectfully,
