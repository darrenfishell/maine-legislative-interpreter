Sullivan
LD 1619
Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is 
Rachael Hastey and I am a resident of Sullivan. I am writing to testify in opposition to
LD 1619. As a young college student, I understand that the topic of abortion is a 
sensitive issue and I do not take it lightly. I believe that abortion is wrong and that it is
harmful not only to the lives of the babies, but also to the women carrying the babies. 
Murdering innocent lives is not a helpful solution to any pregnancy. Instead of 
promoting the use of abortion, the State of Maine should be promoting real, 
life-saving solutions such as pregnancy crisis centers, domestic violence reduction, 
adoption, and fostering. The medical providers that care for patients in the State of 
Maine should be doing everything they can to save and protect the lives of both 
mothers and babies. Under no circumstance should a person be killed in the name of 
healthcare. Every life is valuable and I pray that we would come together as a state to 
protect and to honor life. Thank you for your time and consideration of my concern.
