LD 1619
Write today to urge out not to pass for LD 1619.
    Iâ€™m opposed to abortion at any time and especially LD 1619 because is too extreme
for Maine.
This bill would allow a viable baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed.
Adoption is a far better alternative and the best solution for the Mother and baby.
Medical necessity is already covered by current law and LD 1619 is not necessary.
Thank You.
