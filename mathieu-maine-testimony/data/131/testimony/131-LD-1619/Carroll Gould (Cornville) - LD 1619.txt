Carroll Gould
Cornville
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Monen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Carroll Gould and I am a resident of Corville, 
Maine. I am giving written testimony against Legislative document No. 1619. I have 
lived in Maine my whole life. I am 78 years old and during my lifetime I have seen 
many things happen that are wrong.  I grew up in the Maine woods and was taught to 
respect life. I believe with all my heart that this bill is absolutely wrong.  I am a 
Christian and I believe strongly in God and all of his wisdom, and I will hang onto his
words found in Exodus 10:13 which says, "Thow shall not murder."  I believe with all
my heart this bill is still a license to murder. I realize that sometimes the mother or the
baby's life is in danger and an abortion may be the only answer.
