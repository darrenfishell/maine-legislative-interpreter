LD 1619
Senators and Representatives of Maine
I am 49 years old and have lived and worked in Maine my whole life.  I am proud to 
call it home and would like to live here the rest of my life.
LD 1619 is a violent assault on life - having an abortion on the same day a baby can 
be born is infanticide.
This bill would be shameful for the State of Maine and I would have to decide if I can
live in a state with these types of values.
Please realize at 6,7,8,9 months this is a baby that can be born and thrive and vote no 
on LD 1619!
