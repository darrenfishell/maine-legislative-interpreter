Please consider the life of the unborn child. The women in my life that have had an 
abortion regret it, they struggle with anxiety and regret and wonder what this child 
would be today. The heart beat is heard at 5 weeks this is a beautiful gift from God. If 
abortion clinic would do Ultrasound and monitor the heart beat before the abortion 
most women would not follow through with the abortion. I dont beleive a tissue has a 
heart beat because its not a tissue its a BABY. So i ask again please consider that little
heart beat.
