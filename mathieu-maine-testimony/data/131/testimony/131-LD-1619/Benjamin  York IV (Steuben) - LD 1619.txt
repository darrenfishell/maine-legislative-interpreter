The earliest a premature baby has been born and survived is 21 weeks. Brain activity 
and heart beats can be detected around 6 weeks. In the age of 3D ultrasounds and 
other advancements in medical technology, how can we even consider legalizing 
abortion up until the moment of birth? How can anyone justify ending the life of a 
pre-born baby, when that baby is proven to be alive and could survive outside the 
womb? How is this not legalizing murder? What measure is next for consideration? 
Legalizing the murder of children after they are born? Put away politics and look at 
the evidence. Don't choose murder, choose life.
