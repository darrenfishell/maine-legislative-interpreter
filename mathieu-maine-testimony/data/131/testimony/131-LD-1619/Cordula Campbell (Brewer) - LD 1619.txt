Senator Carney, Representative Moonan, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Cordula Campbell, and I am a resident of Brewer. I am here to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619. 
Wouldn't we all agree that the Holocaust was deplorable? How could such an atrocity ever 
happen? It happened by dehumanizing human beings. Looking at history, it was insidious, a 
slow fade, a pointing of fingers, and, most of all, citizens not rising up and taking the stand that 
every life is valuable! 
If abortion was legal in Germany in 1965, l would not be here. An Army GI from Brewer, Maine, 
left a young German girl pregnant, which was not in their plans, especially for the young 
German girl, whose stepfather wanted her to abort. 
If I did not have a brave German grandmother who became pregnant by a prisoner of war in 
1943, my mother wouldn't be here. Because of the bravery of two young, strong women who 
chose life, l am alive, my sons are alive, my granddaughter, and beyond! 
Please let our beautiful green pine tree state be known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness, not death and the destruction of innocent lives without a voice. Abortion is a silent 
Holocaust done behind closed doors. Be brave, stand up for life, and vote no against this 
deplorable deadly legislation! Please vote ought not to pass. 
Cordula Campbell
