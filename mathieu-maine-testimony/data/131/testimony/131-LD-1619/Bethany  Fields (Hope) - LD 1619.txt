Bethany  Fields
Hope
LD 1619
My name is Bethany Fields and I live in Hope.  I am a parent of 2 children who are 
now 23 and 18.  I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619.  I personally don't 
believe in abortion at any time during pregnancy as I believe life begins at conception 
and every life should be valued.   This bill of late term abortion I am opposed to as is 
the greater population of Maine. This bill would allow a baby that could survive 
outside the womb to be killed.  I was born and raised in Maine and have lived in 
Maine all my life, we value human life much more than that.  I've seen the statistics 
showing over 65% of Maine is not in favor of later term abortion, please listen to the 
people do not let this go through.  This is an extreme bill. If this passes Maine would 
have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country, we do not want that.
This is not only a drastic bill but also completely unnecessary.
