My name is Dorisann Wagner.  I live in Fairfield. I am against LD 1619. My views on
abortion changed when we were trying to have a child and needed to use the In Vitro 
Fertilization procedure. We got to see our son as an embryo, and at 6 weeks we were 
able to listen to his heartbeat!  Seeing the ultrasounds further into the pregnancy, we 
could see Samuel moving inside the belly. BEING ABLE TO ABORT A BABY 
THAT IS VIABLE, BREAKS MY HEART.  Thank you for considering my 
testimony.
