LD 1619
I am writing in support of LD 1619.  I strongly support the individual’s right to make 
the difficult decision to abort a pregnancy without interference from political 
ideology.  This is a decision for a pregnant person in consultation with a medical 
provider.    In addition, judges and legislators who have personal opinions and/or 
political motivations for attempting to restrict the ability for persons to determine 
their own reproductive choices are not qualified in any manner to choose a “cutoff 
date” after which abortion is not allowed.  
No one wants to be in the position to seek an abortion.  It is a choice of last resort.  
But it is a choice that sometimes is best.  I have been there, and it was the most 
difficult decision I have ever made.  I do not regret it. I am glad that I had the choice.  
People who have made this choice will do what they can to end the pregnancy.  
Imagine a pregnant person is 1 day beyond the date that was determined by the 
legislators as the cutoff date – the gestational age beyond which legislators have 
determined an abortion cannot occur???  I can imagine many legislators have no idea 
how one determines how far along a pregnancy is. 
Here is a definition of gestational age from Healthline: 
While gestational age is measured from the first day of your last menstrual period, 
fetal age is calculated from the date of conception. This is during ovulation, which 
means that fetal age is about two weeks behind gestational age. This is the actual age 
of the fetus.  
I don’t think I need to elaborate on why this could be problematic. 
There are multiple problems associated with legislation attempting to interfere with a 
person’s private decisions. The above reflects just one of them. 
Therefore, I am in support of the provisions in this bill related to gestational age and 
also of the other provisions regarding data collection and the criminal code.
