My name is Steven Holmes. Most of my life I have lived in Texas but now live in 
Woodland, Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts. I'm 71 years 
old and was never blessed to have natural children. I have learned that the only two 
countries that allow full term abortions are North Korea and China. I would appeal to 
the Maine Legislature body to not put Maine on the same moral depraved level as 
these two countries that use abortion as a means of birth control.
