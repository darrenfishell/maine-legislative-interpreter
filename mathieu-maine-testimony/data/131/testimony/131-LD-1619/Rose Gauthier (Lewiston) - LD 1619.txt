Good Afternoon Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Rose Gauthier and lam a-resident of Lewiston, ME. lamhereto teslifyin-opposition to LD 
1619. With all due respect, thank you for this opportunity to speak today.- 
I am testifying in opposition to LD 1619 because this bill would allow for abortion at ANY time, for ANY 
reason and this is too-extreme forMaine. Maine would--have one ofthemostextreme abortion laws in 
the entire country, which is unnecessary since, at this time, medical necessity for abortion is already 
covered by current law. Abortion is an extremely lethal measure not to be taken lightly, it should be 
limited to a tight regulation-set by theÂ» law to-protect-the-rights of the unborn -children of our future 
generations. 
l am against abortion, but l do believe thatif it must be medically necessary, then we ought to make 
heavy restrictions on it to prevent misuse and make sure that without a doubt it is the only viable option 
to save a life- Making abortion easily available for any reason up to the time of birth will only increase 
the likelihood of abuse of the privilege to take a life unethically. 
Please oppose this unnecessary extreme abortion bill that the majority of Mainers do not want to see 
pass. Thank you.
