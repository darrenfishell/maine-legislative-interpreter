LD 1619
I'm Judith Dorsey from Belgrade and I am to opposed LD1619 because my faith 
teaches me that all life sacred. I have counseled women at First Choice pregnancy 
center in Waterville in past years. When pregnant women saw the ultrasound of their 
fetus they realized that this is a viable human life and chose to keep their baby and not
abort it.
PLease vote no on LD 1619 to protect human life.
