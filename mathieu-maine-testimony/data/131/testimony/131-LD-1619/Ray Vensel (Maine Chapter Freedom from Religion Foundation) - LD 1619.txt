Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony IN FAVOR OF LD 1619.  
For reasons of demographic analysis and public health, a report on induced abortions must be 
written and saved by Vital Records. The proposed legislation would protect the identifiable 
personal information of the patient, which is a positive thing when the current political climate is 
considered. The bill would also clarify the decision-making process and any remaining legal 
issues.   
Please pass this bill. Thank you.
