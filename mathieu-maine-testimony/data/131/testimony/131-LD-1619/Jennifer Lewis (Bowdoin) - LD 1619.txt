Good afternoon Honorable Judiciary Committee,
I would like to be at the state house in person and that was my intent, but our baby 
came down with a fever and was sick during the night. I am watching from home.
I live in Bowdoin with my husband and three children, two biological and one foster, 
all sweet girls. 
When I look back at the history of our nation and other nations, I can give you 
example after example of discrimination, in one form or another. Once upon a time 
we de-humanized black people because they are not white. Once upon a time people 
de-humanized Jewish people because they did not follow the Nazi agenda. In 2023 we
de-humanize babies because of their age and size. When will the world stop wanting 
to kill people because they don't fit into whatever the world's absurd definition of a 
human being is? Please, help us not to repeat history, but instead move onto a better 
future.
