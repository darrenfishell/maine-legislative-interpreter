LD 1619
I urge you to vote that LD 1619 ought not to pass. This bill goes way beyond 
improving reproductive privacy laws, as indicated by its title. It would permit the 
abortion of a viable baby for any reason. Under current law, a pregnant woman has 
plenty of time prior to the viability of the child to choose to end her pregnancy. 
Current law also permits a later abortion to preserve the life or health of the mother. 
The law should be left as it is in order to protect the lives of these viable babies.
