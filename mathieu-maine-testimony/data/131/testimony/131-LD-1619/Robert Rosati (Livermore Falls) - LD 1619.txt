Livermore Falls
LD 1619
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Noonan and Maine Judiciary Committee 
members, I, Robert Rosati of East Livermore, representing my family, oppose 
LD1619 an Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. Please vote against 
this horrific instrument of death. 
                                                    Gratefully,
                                              Robert Rosati and Family
