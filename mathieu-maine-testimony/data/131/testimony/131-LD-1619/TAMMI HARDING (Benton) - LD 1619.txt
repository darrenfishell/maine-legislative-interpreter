Please know that I am strongly opposed to killing babies at any stage, for any reason.  
I have adopted 2 children out of the foster care system and those 2 children were and 
are such a blessing and joy in my life.  If you are going to be spending all of this time 
and all of this money, please do so by helping the foster care system, offering care for 
the mother, making adoption easier and the process not a burden on the family 
wishing to adopt. 
Thank you
