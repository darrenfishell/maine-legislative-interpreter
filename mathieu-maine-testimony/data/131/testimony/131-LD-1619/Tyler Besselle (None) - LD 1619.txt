Senator carney and representative moonen, honorable members of the joint standing committee 
on judiciary 
l am Tyler Bessette speaking in opposition of Ld16'i9 "An act to improve l\1laine ‘s reproductive 
privacy laws" 
There is a such thing as right and wrong. lt's written on our hearts. We all know right from 
wrong. We are born knowing it. We can only choose to suppress it. That is what this bill is doing. 
This bill is taking the unborn and brutally murdering them. lt is quite clearly wrong. By passing 
this bill we are suppressing our sense of right and wrong. Attempting to erase it entirely. And 
teaching away this crucial instinct from our children will lead to more suffering than our state has 
ever seen 
What will happen when you tell our young there is no right and wrong. When you tell them 
Murder is okay. Tell them that the basic truths we all know are non existent. You get chaos, You 
get lawlessness. You get shootings, murders and rape. This is not what Maine wants. This.is 
not what rnaine needs. This is not what our state represents. 
We need to hold ﬁrm to basic truth. Teach right from wrong. Discipline our young when they 
stray from it. So when the time oomes when heinous bills like this ere being considered we 
throw it out as it should properly be. That is the right thing to do and that is the truth.
