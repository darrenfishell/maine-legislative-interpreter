LD 1619
I am writing today to urge you to oppose LD1619.  This law would allow babies to be
murdered up until the moment they are born and people who performed abortions 
without licenses would have no punishment!  I am having a hard time believing this is
even being considered in Maine where I have lived for my entire life.  We have six 
children and my husband and I saw them all on ultrasound videos from five weeks old
until not long before birth.  To say that little, tiny baby at any stage is not a human 
being would be a lie.  Those children that are mostly grown into adults now were not 
part of my body!  They were new, tiny, miraculous humans that we would have done 
anything to protect and nurture.  Every life is precious, designed by God, and deserves
to be protected.  As humans, no matter how small, we have the fundamental right to 
life and liberty. 
     Have you ever seen a video of how these babies are butchered in the womb?  They
can feel pain very early on.  They can survive outside of the womb as early as 21 
weeks!  This bill would allow them to kill a full-grown baby that could feel pain and 
live outside the womb at any time.  That needs to be called what it is--Evil.  What 
about the women who would die along with their babies having abortions by 
unlicensed individuals?  As we have seen, many women die in the licensed facilities.  
This would be much worse.  We all need to choose a side in America today, the way 
this country is falling apart.  It is coming down to a simple choice.  Good and evil.  
Don't be on the side of murder and evil.  Protect women and their babies.  Let them 
live!
