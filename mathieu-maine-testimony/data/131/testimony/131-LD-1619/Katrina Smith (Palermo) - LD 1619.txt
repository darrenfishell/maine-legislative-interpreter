LD 1619
Doctors are not infallible. Testimony after testimony and story after story reveals that 
a doctor, a medical professional, was completely wrong in their diagnosis of the 
health of a baby.  My 23 year old daughter, Emma, was one such case.
Abort her, she will not be viable he told me. The Doctor was wrong and the doctor 
would have taken her life from me, from my family and from this world. 
My daughters husband was born at 27 weeks and the doctors advised his mother that 
he would not survive out of the womb due to heart conditions. He is now a newly 
graduated rocket scientist with nothing physically wrong with him. 
Late term abortion gives doctors more opportunities to be wrong and to snuff out the 
life of a loved and desired child.  Vote no on LD 1619 - we cannot risk a doctor 
continuing to be wrong and having more opportunity to mislead women and 
recommend unnecessary abortions.
