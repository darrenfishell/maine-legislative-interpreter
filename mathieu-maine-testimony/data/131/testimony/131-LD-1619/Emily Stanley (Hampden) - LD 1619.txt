Emily Stanley
Hampden
LD 1619
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Emily Stanley and I reside in Hampden.  I am testifying in opposition of 
LD 1619.
As a woman and mother, I am deeply opposed to this extreme bill which would allow 
abortion up until the day of birth.
Furthermore, as a woman, I do not desire the right to end the life of another human 
being.  It is wrong.
I urge you to act in opposition to this bill.
Thank you for taking the time to hear my testimony.
