Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Claudia Everett, and I am a resident of Brownfield.  
I am testifying in opposition to LD 1619.  
I still can’t believe that we have come to this point in time in our state that a bill has 
been proposed that would make it permissible to take the lives of unborn babies in 
Maine. What has happened to our state?  Those same babies are the age of the little 
ones we have all seen in NICU’s fighting with every inch of their tiny lives to take their 
first breath on their own and the only thing keeping them alive is their strong will to live.  
And it is the same for the ones still inside their mother’s womb, where it should be the 
safest place in the world. They too want that chance to experience life, no matter how 
long that life may be, and they deserve the right to be loved into this world and if it is 
God’s will, loved while they take their last breath. 
Maine was one of the first states to abolish capital punishment because we knew then 
what we should know now, we don’t have the right to take someone else’s life. Our law 
says that even if that person is a hardened criminal who has taken someone else’s life 
we do not have that right to take their life. But now that same state that used to stand on 
moral principle would like to make it legal to kill the most innocent of lives and no matter 
where you stand on abortion, there is no denying a viable baby is a baby.  
You alone have the power to either save the lives of these children or live with the 
burden of knowing you could have saved thousands of lives but did nothing.  
May God have mercy on the state of Maine.
