LD 1619
I am against LD 1619.  Late term abortion is murder of a live baby.  It is unfair to the 
child as they do not get a say.  If born at 28, 32 weeks and so on they would be born 
alive.  Then what?  Lots of children are born with handicaps and live good happy and 
productive lives.  Let's not forget about the psychological repercussions that the 
mother will experience if she goes along with this.  Her life will never be the same.  
Later children who are born from this mother's womb will experience growing and 
developing in a haunted womb space.  What do you think their emotional 
development will be developing in a womb where the baby before them wasn't 
welcomed and subsequently murdered?   I was pushed into an abortion as a young 
child and it was the worst mistake of my life.  That baby was 8 weeks when it took 
place and I to this day regret the abortion, yet was encouraged and pushed into it by 
medical providers.  Now we are talking abortion after 24 weeks.  This is crazy stuff.  
How many mother's may get pushed into something that they will regret and how 
many haunted wombs will produce psychologically disturbed other children,that is 
what I want to know.
