LD 1619
Testimony to be printed 
May 1st, 2023
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on
Judiciary, my name is Beth Bennett and I am a resident of Gray, Maine and I have 
lived in this state for 38 years.  I would like you to understand why I am opposed to 
LD1619.  I believe that LD1619, “The act to improve Maine’s reproductive privacy 
law” is not actually accomplishing what the name of the bill implies.  The small part 
of the bill that allows a person to have an abortion and not have their name attached to
the event does indeed appear to be an attempt to protect their privacy, however the 
rest of the extreme bill seems aimed at allowing the murder of viable babies with no 
criminal consequences for it.  As a resident of this state, this is not what I want and I 
believe that most Mainers do not want this type of legislation either.  Our current laws
address issues of viability and life and death situations.  
Please do not allow this change to be made.  Up to birth abortions are not humane and
not necessary!  We do not want to become a society that is about convenience without
recognizing the cost and the ultimate consequences of a total disregard for human life 
at any stage in life, from the very young to the old.  
Thank you for considering my position on this issue.
