"Maine - The Way Life Should Be", except for the pre-born.  The womb should be 
the safest place in the world, but it has become a place of unspeakable pain and 
suffering for the most innocent victims.  Little lives, made in the image of God, 
snuffed out before they take their first breath.   Legislators, please consider your 
actions - the idea of taking away the life of a child in the womb, and particularly one 
who is full-term, is beyond moral and ethical comprehension.  You can speak life or 
death into our great state - the choice is yours.  Choose life!
Thank you
