Dear
Legislator,
My
name
is
Tyler
Wentland,
and
I
live
in
York.
I
am
writing
in
opposition
to
LD
1619.
Friends
from
our
local
parish
recently
celebrated
the
birth
of
a
beautiful
baby
girl
via
emergency
c-section,
but
their
hopes
quickly
gave
way
to
fear
when
doctors
realized
her
lungs
had
collapsed,
necessitating
a
helicopter
ride
from
Maine
to
Boston
for
emergency
treatment.
Thankfully,
she
made
it,
and
got
to
go
home
a
few
days
later
with
her
parents
and
is
doing
well.
Honestly,
she’s
one
of
the
most
beautiful
babies
I’ve
ever
seen.
I
assume
you
are
as
relieved
with
that
outcome
as
our
family
was.
What
then
is
the
qualitative
difference
between
the
life
of
little
Amelia
who
was
rushed
from
one
state
to
the
next
for
life-saving
intervention
and
that
of
any
other
baby,
from
viability
to
the
moment
of
birth,
the
time
frame
to
which
LD
1619
would
allow
that
same
child
to
be
killed
for
any
reason
at
any
time?
Who
gets
to
decide?
Medical
necessity
cannot
be
the
reason,
as
that
is
already
covered
under
Maine
law,
putting
the
issue
of
risk
to
the
life
of
the
mother
aside
in
this
discussion.
Some
claim
it
is
to
preserve
a
woman’s
choice
because
it
is
her
body
that
must
grow,
nurture,
sustain,
and
deliver
that
child.
But
if
the
child
can
survive
outside
the
womb
and
must
be
delivered
whether
it
is
wanted
or
not,
why
then
does
the
mother,
or
the
father,
or
the
state
get
to
determine
that
a
viable
child
should
not
be
delivered
alive,
treated
with
care,
and
placed
for
adoption,
if
the
mother
and
father
cannot
or
will
not
care
for
it?
Either
way
the
child
must
be
delivered,
and
either
way
the
child
is
no
longer
a
burden
to
his
or
her
parents.
So
the
reason
cannot
be
the
right
to
choose.
If
it
is
claimed
that
the
child
still
in
the
womb
is
not
technically
a
“person”,
then
one
must
ask
‘what
is
a
person?’
By
what
standard
has
the
state
of
Maine
determined
itself
the
arbiter
of
who
qualifies
as
a
person?
In
what
moral
framework
is
the
state
operating
to
make
such
a
determination?
And
when
does
this
transformation
take
place?
Is
this
determination
made
biologically?
Socially?
Culturally?
Spiritually?
If
these
questions
cannot
be
answered,
perhaps
the
state
should
pause
because
modern
science
shows
us
that
at
the
very
least,
at
the
point
of
viability,
what
comes
from
human
parents
are
human
beings
and
human
beings
are
traditionally
understood
to
be
persons
given
our
capacity
to
achieve
a
rational
nature.
Put
it
this
way,
in
one
case,
life
is
valued
as
a
fundamental
good
and
preserved
by
the
state’s
commitment
to
that
good.
In
the
other,
life
is
deemed
arbitrary,
subjective,
and
based
on
the
will
and
whim
of
the
powerful.
History
shows
that
when
the
powerful
take
it
upon
themselves
to
decide
that
some
members
of
society
are
expendable,
we
are
on
a
very
dark
road.
I
ask
you
not
to
support
LD
1619,
for
the
sake
of
reason,
compassion,
and
commitment
to
life
as
a
fundamental
good
worth
preserving
-
especially
when
that
life
can
survive
outside
the
womb,
must
be
delivered
regardless
of
whether
it
is
wanted,
and
be
a
gift
to
families
who
desperately
want
a
child
to
love
and
care
for.
A
society,
let
alone
a
state,
where
a
baby
on
the
brink
of
death
will
be
flown
in
a
personal
helicopter
across
state
lines
and
kept
alive
using
some
of
the
most
sophisticated
technology
available,
is
incongruous
with
a
society
that
determines
that
same
child’s
life
can
be
ended
by
the
abortionists
tools
post-viability
at
any
time
for
any
reason.
One
society
is
clearly
better
than
the
other.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
and
for
voting
ought
not
to
pass
.
Tyler
Wentland
