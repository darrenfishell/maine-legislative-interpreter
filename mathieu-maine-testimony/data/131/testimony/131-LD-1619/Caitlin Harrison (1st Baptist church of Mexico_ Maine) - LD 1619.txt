1st Baptist church of Mexico, Maine
LD 1619
My name is Caitlin Mikayla Harrison. I am a resident of Rumford, Maine.  I am 
against LD 1619.  I believe life is a gift.  God has formed these babies in the womb.  
Psalm 139:13-18.  Jeremiah 1:5.  I believe an innocent life and we all know that a 
fetus is a baby.
