LD 1619
  I am asking that you will vote no on LD1619.  This bill is too extreme, and barbaric. 
Even if you are pro choice please stop and consider the life of an human, full term, 
fully formed, able to hear sounds.  To allow that life to be ended is morally wrong.  
There are laws already in place to protect the life of the mother.  This law is about 
allowing a woman to end her pregnancy at anytime. I respectfully ask you to vote no 
on LD1619.
