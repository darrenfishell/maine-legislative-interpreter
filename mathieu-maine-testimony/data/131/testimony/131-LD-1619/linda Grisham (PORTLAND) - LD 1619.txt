  My name is Linda, I've been an RN for 40 years and unfortunately am now disabled 
and unable to testify in person.  I'm a Christian and love others which is why I became
an RN.  I have been with women that have lost a baby by miscarriage and even 
abortion and their pain emotionally is heinous.  Many women/men regret an abortion 
and few are happy with the abortion aftermath.  Unfortunately a miscarriage isn't 
always preventable especially less than 20 weeks, but abortions are.  
  I'm concerned with abortions as a Christian, but as an American I'm concerned with 
abortions over 20 weeks due to the right of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness".
  Please consider the voice of the baby that needs protection.
thank-you and I pray the right decision will be made.
Linda  RN
