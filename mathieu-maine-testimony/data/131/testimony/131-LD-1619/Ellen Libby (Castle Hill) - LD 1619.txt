I am appalled to think that our state would even consider this bill - there are 
documented times when babies have been born prematurely, and with proper medical 
care have lived a productive life. This bill would allow BABIES to be killed just 
before entering this world - how gruesome is that! Why does someone need 9 months 
to decide at the last minute to abort a BABY? There are so many parents who would 
gladly adopt a baby, and organizations who can help with that process. PLEASE don't
snuff out the lives of these BABIES - they deserve a chance!
