LD 1619
Hello, my name is Matthew and I oppose the bill LD1619.  Life begins at conception. 
If it didn't, when does it start?  WHAT IS the unborn if not a child?  
I have a friend who had a preemie child at 37 weeks and is now a healthy 8 month old
baby boy.  When did this preemies life begin?  At birth?  Once he was released from 
the NICU?  If this baby had life when he was delivered at 37 weeks, would he not 
have had life at 37 weeks if he were still in his mother's womb?  How can we deliver 
babies at 37 weeks and fight for a full-term abortion and not consider this 
MURDER??  
WHY do we play this game with LIFE??
WHAT IS the unborn if not A CHILD??
Abortion at any time is WRONG, but this bill is WAY too EXTREME!!
Please just think of what this bill is actually doing.  It is not fixing anything.  It is 
simply allowing more babies to be killed...  And much more obviously.
Simply put, this bill cannot be passed by anyone who would deny a late term abortion 
as being murder.  Be honest, it's obvious.  This is the life of a child we are talking 
about.
GOD had placed you in this very place to for this very moment.  It is my prayer that 
you will make the right decision in regard to this bill.
