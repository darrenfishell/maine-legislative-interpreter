Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Maureen Seaberg, and l’m a resident of Phillips. l’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
I am a registered nurse of over 15 years. The preservation of babies in there 
mother’s wombs is vital, lite is precious. The mother’s womb is the place a baby 
should be safest, not a place where the baby can be murdered. Extending abortion 
rights to full term pregnancy is the taking away of lives. There are people willing to 
adopt babies. A legislature that would bring this abortion law to pass and the 
doctors that would perform this brutal act are murderers. The Blood of these 
innocent babies would be on their hands. 
lt would be a thing of great depravity if we as the people of Maine would consider 
abortion to be alright with us. Morally we would be sinking into great spiritual 
darkness and callousness of heart. Who will speak up for the unborn, we the 
people of Maine should. Life begins at conception and ends at natural death. 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank You
