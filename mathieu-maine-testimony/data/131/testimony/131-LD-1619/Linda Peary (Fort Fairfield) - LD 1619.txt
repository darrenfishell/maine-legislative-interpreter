LD 1619
To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Linda Peary.  I am writing this testimony in regards to LD 1619 and the 
proposed changes to the current abortion laws.  I do not believe this is a good or 
healthy direction for Maine to go in.  Removing the “in the case of the mother’s 
health or life” wording from the current law dehumanizes and desensitizes the value 
of a human life.  I fear it would create a slippery slope to future laws to eliminate 
others (elderly, mentally challenged, etc) that society does not deem necessary or 
worth being allowed to live.  We should value life not leave it as “whatever is deemed
necessary” in order to end life.
There are also several laws regarding criminal charges for those who injure or murder
an unborn baby after the point of viability.  Since these laws exist, in the case or 
injury or murder, then the same standard/worth should be applied to the viability of 
the unborn in regards to abortion.  Again, removing the current exceptions of the 
mother’s health and life, would leave it all up to whatever reason is deemed 
necessary.
Please vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1619 and give a voice to the innocent, unborn.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Linda R. Peary
