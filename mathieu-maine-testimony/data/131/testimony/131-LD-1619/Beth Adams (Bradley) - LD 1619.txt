Bradley
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
My name is Beth Adams and I live in Bradley.  I am writing today to testify in 
opposition of LD 1619.
I cannot support this bill and the language it contains. Though some believe that 
abortion is a womanâ€™s choice, I dare say most would be against late-term abortion, 
especially for reasons other than the health of the mother.  At what point do we take 
into account the rights of the baby.  We need to be the voice for these babies who can 
not speak for themselves.  I urge you to vote ought not to pass.  
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
Beth A. Adams
