People all around the world recognize the sacredness of human life. We have laws 
preventing the mistreatment of people. Children learn in the womb, and know those 
around them. They are thinking and learning before they are born. These children are 
genetically distinct from their parents. We need less abortion, not more.
No one of you deliberating these bills were aborted. Consider yourself privileged to 
be the voice of those who do not have one.
This bill ought not be considered nor voted to pass.
