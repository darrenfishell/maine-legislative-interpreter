LD 1619
I do not support LD1619. You do not have to be pro-life to agree that abortion up to 
birth is a dangerous and violent violation of human rights. Any argument about 
medical necessity is untrue. A woman is always able to receive life-saving, necessary 
care from her doctor during pregnancy. No law prevents that. But we must, as humans
who were allowed to be born, afford others the same opportunity. We must protect 
human life. We must speak for those who canâ€™t speak for themselves. Please hear the 
people in this state as we tell you, this bill cannot be passed.
