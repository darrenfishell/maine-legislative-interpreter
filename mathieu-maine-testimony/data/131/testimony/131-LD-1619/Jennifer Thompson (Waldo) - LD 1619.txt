Jennifer Thompson
Waldo
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on
Judiciary, my name is Jennifer Thompson and I am a resident of Waldo. I am here to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619.‚Äù  This would allow a baby that could have survived 
outside of the womb to be killed.  This is murder of a life and should never be 
allowed.  We must stop this madness!
