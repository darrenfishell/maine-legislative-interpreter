Pete Harring
Washington
LD 1619
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Pete Harring and I am a resident of 
Washington. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I personally believe that abortion is wrong and would not ever encourage anyone to 
get one. I have also not wanted to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her 
body. I understand that there may be medical reasons to have one performed and 
current Maine law addresses those issues. If this bill were to pass then Maine would 
have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country. 
This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. Once a 
baby is capable of living outside of the womb, there is no longer a reason to justify 
ending the life of the baby. 
I am against late-term abortion and ask that all of you do the moral and just thing and 
vote “OUGHT NOT TO PASS”. Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too 
extreme for Maine.
Thank you for your time. Have a Blessed day.
