Maria Grolimund
Waterville
LD 1619
    Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Maria Grolimund and I am a resident 
of Waterville. I am submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 1619.
     Under LD 1619 a baby that could survive outside of the womb could be killed for 
any reason the medical provider decides. This is morally and ethically wrong. Babies 
can be put up for adoption rather than killed.
     LD 1619 would also be one of the most extreme abortion laws in the U. S.
     I was born early. Fortunately for me, I was wanted, and abortion was illegal. I am 
pro-life.
