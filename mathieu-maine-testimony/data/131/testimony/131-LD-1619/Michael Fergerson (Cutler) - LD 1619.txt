LD 1619
My name is Michael Fergerson, from Cutler ME, and I oppose LD 1619. The Lord 
Jesus is the giver of life. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away, not man. LD 1619 
is just another stepping stone of man trying to play God. God has appointed for man 
(mankind) to die once-Hebrews 9:27. We shouldn’t be playing any part in the 
scheduling of another human beings death, especially an innocent one who cant speak
for or defend themself. Commandment #6 says “You shall not murder” and that’s 
exactly what this bill further allows for, ending innocent life. Please put an end to this 
bill, and preserve and love life like God does and intended. We will all stand before 
the Lord Jesus one day and give an account for our life, decisions that we made, etc. 
and be judged according to our deeds. Let us not be found guilty of supporting LD 
1619. Thank you for your time.
