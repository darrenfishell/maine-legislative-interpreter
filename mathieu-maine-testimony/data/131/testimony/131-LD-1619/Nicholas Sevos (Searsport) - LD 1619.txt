My name is Nicholas Sevos, and I am a resident of Searsport. Full disclosure, right 
out of the gate, I admit freely that I am against all abortion; in my opinion an unborn 
child is always innocent and should never be murdered. However, I write today not to 
try and convince you to take my stance; I write because this new bill is nothing less 
then heinous and evil. Whatever language you use, you are allowing a fully developed
child, possibly moments away from being born, to be killed by a doctor in his 
"professional judgement", as if we havent' learned over the last several years that the 
professional judgement of any physician can be purchased just as easily as the 
principles of a politician. There is no bow you can put on this, no neat wrapping paper
that can conceal the fact that this bill would allow baby, about to be born, to be killed.
It doesn't matter if you don't think people would do it or not, the reality is someone 
would because people have. That is not hyperbole, that is a simple horrific fact of life.
I would also like to point out that a certain Governor promised during her debates that
she would make no changes to the abortion bills in this state, and the "moderates" fell 
for it, buying the proverbial bridge that was being sold. Make no mistake; this is NOT
moderate. You will be making a decision, here and now, supporting this bill, to be a 
radical, not a moderate. That will be remembered, I assure each and every one of you.
Abortion is wrong, of this I am certain; but this goes into a whole new realm of evil; 
there is no claim of ignorance or argument about viability anymore with this bill, 
there is only the death of the innocent. Please do not go through with this; if you have 
any semblance of a conscience, of any faith in God, please search your soul and know
that this is just evil.
