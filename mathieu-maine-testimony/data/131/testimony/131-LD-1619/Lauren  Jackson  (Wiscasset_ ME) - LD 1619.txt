LD 1619
I am writing to let my legislators know that I oppose LD 1619. I am pro-life at any 
stage of gestation because of my beliefs regarding the sanctity of life no matter the 
developmental stage of an individual. However, this bill is even more extreme, as it 
would allow for the ending of a life of a child that could survive outside the womb. 
This is unconscionable and unacceptable. The current law provides for instances of 
medical necessity, so that is not a good reason to pass this bill. 
I oppose LD 1619
