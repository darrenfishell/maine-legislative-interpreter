To start I would like to say thank you for listening today. I cannot comprehend in my 
mind how we have come to this point in our country. To allow a child in the womb to 
be aborted at full term and yet if that child is born and subjected to abuse and die after
birth we will charge the abuser with murder. I ask you all to search your hearts and I 
pray that you find that the truth is that this is murder too.
