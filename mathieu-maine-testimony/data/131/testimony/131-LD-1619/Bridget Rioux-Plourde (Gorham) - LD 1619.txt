Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Bridget Rioux-Plourde, and I am a resident of 
Gorham, Maine. I am here along with my children to testify in opposition to LD 1619.I 
oppose LD 776 and LD 1343 as well. 
My first reason I oppose LD 1619 is that this bill would allow a baby who could survive 
outside the womb to be killed. Maine abolished the death penalty in 1887 because it ls 
inhumane. I agree with that. in Maine, though, unborn babies aren’t even treated with 
the same respect that we treat murderers. If LD 1619 passes, unborn babies right up 
until birth could be given the penalty of death- their only crime is that they were 
conceived. 
Secondly, expanding abortion up until birth is morally wrong. Even if you ignore the 
religion side of this, the fact is that doctors are not infallible. They could be wrong about 
an incurable disease that they claim an unborn baby has, and this has happened. 
Lastly, in the words of Alan Guttmacher, former president of Planned Parenthood, "in 
(his)17 years there has never been a case where an abortion was necessary to savea 
mother’s life. A baby can be delivered by c-section much faster than it can be killed and 
dismembered by abortion, so if it’s a matter of necessity such as for mother's health, 
wouldn't it be faster to deliver the baby and then treat the mother for her health 
conditions?" 
In closing, I leave you with this thought- ‘No one ever regrets choosing life.’ 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. 
Bridget Rioux~Plourde
