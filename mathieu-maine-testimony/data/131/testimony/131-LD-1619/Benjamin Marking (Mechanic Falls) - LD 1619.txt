Benjamin Marking
Mechanic Falls
LD 1619
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee;
   My name is Benjamin Marking and I live in Mechanic Falls. I am a parent of two 
young children, one of which we adopted after he had drug exposure in the womb and
was born early. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619.
  I am testifying because if someone has not personally known a child born 
prematurely, they might not realize how fully a person that child is, and how 
important their life is.
I have seen statistics that at least 2/3 of Mainers don't agree with late-term abortion.
Our own governor stated she felt Maine's law didn't need to be changed. It is easy to 
say "but what if there were a situation where the child's life could cost the mother's 
life," and therefore refuse to take a stand on this issue, but I have seen many doctors 
say they have never encountered a situation where aborting the baby would save the 
mother's life, because they can just deliver the baby and treat the mother. I'm here to 
also say, "What about the lives of the babies destined to become healthy, talented, 
citizens with so much to offer their communities?"
  Abortion at ANY time, for ANY reason is too extreme for Maine. This bill would 
allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. Maine would have one 
of the most extreme abortion laws in in the entire country, if this bill passed. Please 
Oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill, that the majority of Mainers do not want to see 
pass. Our state does not need more of its children killed in the womb.
Thank you.
