I am begging you to please reconsider signing this bill as it is written. The definition of killing is 
to stop a heartbeat. And I can compromise with abortions. If it is up to 12 weeks, please 
reconsider do not allow anybody by doctors to give and terminate any pregnancies, and ifa 
pregnancy Hass to be terminated before full term, everything should be done to keep that fetus 
alive.4 
Thank you so much. Tammy Peabody
