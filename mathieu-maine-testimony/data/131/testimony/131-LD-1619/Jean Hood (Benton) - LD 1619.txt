Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Jean Hood, I live in Benton, and am the mother of two adult children and 
eight grandchildren. I am here to tell you I am opposed to LD 1619, as I don't believe it 
is right for Maine. Our current law already allows for abortion as a medical necessity up 
to full term. 
My question to you is, are you aware of what abortion entails and how painful it is to an 
unborn baby who can feel as we do from early on‘? Do you know what happens should 
the baby survive the abortion and not die in the mother’s womb? Will the baby be left to 
die alone on a table in agony, or given a lethal injection like a criminal? 
Abortion could have touched my life 49 years ago; I was a scared pregnant 16-year-old 
in high school. Abortion was legal then in 1974 and was suggested to me as an option, 
but I'm thankful I chose life for my baby boy instead of death. I am also glad my mother 
chose life for me1—another unplanned pregnancy ——so I could be here today telling you 
my story. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
