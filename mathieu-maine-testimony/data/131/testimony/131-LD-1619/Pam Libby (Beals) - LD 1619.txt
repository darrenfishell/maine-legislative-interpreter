From our friends I Am Pro-Life:
"Abortion isn't healthcare. I'm not a disease that needed to be treated. I was a baby." - 
Jennifer Milbourn, an abortion survivor.
Babies are NOT a disease. They're not parasites or masochistic bullies trying to take 
away our rights. They're babies, and over 64 million have lost their lives to abortion.
