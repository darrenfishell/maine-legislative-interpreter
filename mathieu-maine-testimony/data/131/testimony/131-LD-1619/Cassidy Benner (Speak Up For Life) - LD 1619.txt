Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on testify. My name is Cassidy Benner, I am 23 and a resident of Friendship. I am 
writing this to testify in opposition to LD 1619.  
 
If you have ever held a newborn baby in your hands, you have thought to yourself, “how could 
anything be so perfect”. You know that awe feeling of how precious and innocent that LIFE is. 
This bill would take away that LIFE andwhat they can individually and uniquely bring to this 
world. This bill would KILL that LIFE, and that is NOT okay. These LIVES have no voice, so I will 
gladly be a voice for them. Allowing an abortion is wrong. And to allow an abortion to be 
performed at ANY time in the pregnancy, for ANY reason is evil. It is EXTREME. And it is purely 
and simply unnecessary.  
 
I will finish by saying this. I serve a good and loving God. But I also serve a JUST God. He is 
almighty and powerful and HE IS THE ULTIMATE authority. AND I speak the name of Jesus over 
you and I pray for you. I am PRO LIFE, and you should NOT vote yes for this bill.
