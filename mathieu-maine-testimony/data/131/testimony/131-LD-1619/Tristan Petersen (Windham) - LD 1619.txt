LD 1619
Dear Honorable Chairs and Committee members,
I am writing in opposition of LD 1619. Allowing abortion up to birth is murder. A 
baby, a new, unique human being that has never existed before and will never exist 
again after death - has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness just as any 
of the rest of us do. Just because a woman may find the precious life she carries inside
of her an inconvenience, that doesn't negate the rights the newly-created human being 
has. There is absolutely no reason to change current law, and in fact, we need to go in 
the opposite direction of this proposed law - we need to start protecting the rights of 
newly-created human beings (aka babies). I strongly urge the committee to reject this 
Act.
