LD 1619
To the members of the Judiciary committee,
Everyone experiences troubles and pain; no one's life is free of difficult 
circumstances.  Can a person overcome challenges, even a difficult childhood, and 
become a happy and productive member of society?  Yes.  Should we encourage and 
help people to overcome challenges?  Yes.  Should we encourage death as an option 
to a hurting person? No.
 
I am concerned about the fact that death is being promoted more and more as an easy 
or good solution to life's problems.  Expanding abortion laws means more death to 
babies and death to the souls of the unrepentant adults who support and encourage 
abortion. 
I would like to see our government promoting the services already in place in Maine 
that support women and parents who work through difficult and heart-wrenching 
circumstances and choose to keep or adopt out their precious babies.
Please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS for LD 1619 and LD 1343
They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their 
sons and daughters in the fireâ€”something I did not command, nor did it enter my 
mind.  Jeremiah 7:31
