LD 1619
I will start off by saying, this is a dark time for my country. A time in which we must 
fight for the protection of murder from their own parents. It breaks my heart that any 
woman or man would support the brutal murder of an infant, especially, for reasons 
like casual sex, money, and even just to live without kids and responsibilities. But you
chose to have sex! what is the natural use of sex? Procreation! It’s not something to 
be exploited for money, or pleasure! It’s something only to be done between a 
husband and wife, where in the event that a  child is conceived it will be loved and 
thrive. That is the reason they fight for murder rights, it is clearly, 100%, self 
motivated. An unborn child is undeniably a human life, and the only reason they say 
it’s isn’t is so they can keep having sex, and living life for themselves! They know it’s
murder. but they do not care. Why? Because the most important person in their lives 
is themselves. And that is why I am opposed to LD-1619 and to the blatantly selfish 
nature of my country.
