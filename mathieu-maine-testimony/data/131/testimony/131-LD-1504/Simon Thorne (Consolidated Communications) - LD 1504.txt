Testimony In Support of LD 1504 
" An Act to Exempt Broadband Equipment from the Sales and Use Tax" 
April 26, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is 
Simon Thorne, l live in Farmington, and l am here today on behalf of Consolidated 
Communications in support of LD 1504. 
Much like Maine has historically done with manufacturing equipment, some other states, such 
as New York, Minnesota and lowa, have begun to incentivize the expansion of broadband 
through tax exemptions such as the one proposed in LD 1504. Other states, such as 
Pennsylvania and Missouri have similar, yet different forms of broadband equipment tax 
incentives. 
In 2022, Consolidated Communications spent over $100 million in Maine, and over $2 million in 
sales and use taxes. Our estimated spend in 2023 is over $90 million. A significant portion of 
that investment has been spent on the broadband equipment that is targeted in LD 1504 and 
will compliment Maine's broadband expansion goals. 
We believe that LD 1504 is worth your consideration and support as a continued incentive for 
companies like Consolidated, along with many others, to continue to invest in Maine and 
towards our mutual connectivity goals. Maine's rural areas bring a high cost to deploy any 
network buildout, given the low density. Anything that brings those costs down will help to 
expand further deployment of new networks within the State. 
l would be pleased to answer any questions you may have, or provide more information for the 
work session upon your request. 
Thank you for your consideration.
