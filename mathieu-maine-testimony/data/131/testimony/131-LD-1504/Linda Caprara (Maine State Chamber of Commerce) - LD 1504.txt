Linda Caprara
Maine State Chamber of Commerce
LD 1504
Good morning Sen. Grohoski, Rep. Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation, my name is Linda Caprara.  I am the Vice President of 
Advocacy for the Maine State Chamber of Commerce.  I am here to offer comments 
in support to L.D. 1504, An Act to Exempt Broadband Equipment from the Sales and 
Use Tax”.  
This bill incentivizes broadband expansion in Maine as it is so important to the 
growth of Maine’s economy.  Over the past few years, technology has moved so fast, 
that tax policy in some states needs to be updated to recognize other types of 
investment.  This bill attempts to address this issue.  
This bill proposes to enact a sales & use tax exemption for broadband equipment.  
This exemption is similar to the sales tax exemptions for machinery and equipment 
and others that Maine currently has on the books.  Many of these sales tax exemptions
were enacted in the 1970’s,1980’s and 1990’s when broadband technology was not 
even on the radar yet.  These exemptions are extremely important and exist for a good
reason.  
One of the purposes of sales & use tax exemptions is to prevent pyramiding which is 
a tax on a tax.  Sound tax policy dictates you tax the end product, you don’t tax the 
same product multiple times in the process of being produced. Taxing inputs along 
the way results in double and triple taxation.  In addition, this leverages the private 
investment that internet service providers are making not only in expansion but also in
how the networks are maintaining and upgrading the networks. 
As Maine’s Strategic Plan cites, broadband is the lifeblood of an innovation economy 
and ongoing investment and upgrades in this industry must remain a priority.  Please 
support the industry and future investment in broadband and vote Yes on L.D. 1504.
