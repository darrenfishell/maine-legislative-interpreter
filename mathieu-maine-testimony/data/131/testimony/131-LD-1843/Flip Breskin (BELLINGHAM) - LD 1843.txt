I am writing to support the official legislative naming of this bridge after my sister.  She was a civil & geotechnical engineer who worked very hard designing this bridge, determined to protect the fish run below it. It was a safe, effective design which also saved money. Kitty also designed (and won over the nearby residents of) the first round-about in the state of Maine, as part of two decades of public service. Two photos: Kitty Breskin, dressed as the small dragon who showed up at construction projects to explain to the guys EXACTLY how she expected them to do the blasting for the new roadbed. Another photo, unclipped on the catwalk on the bridge she was building, can only be fully appreciated when you realize that she was nearly blind in one eye and as a result, had almost no depth perception. Something that makes walking along narrow springy plank 50 -70 feet in the air feel like a different sort of challenge than it would be for you or me. Describing our sister as a small dragon is really good. Except she was older than I was, so as a kid I imprinted on her as a large dragon. With talons and long teeth. She always could breathe fire. I love the story of a time when her non-engineer bosses overruled her on where a highway was sited, and it did indeed fail. By some miracle no one died. But the thought of her bosses scorched faces afterwards still pleases me. Kitty believed in public safety and the general good. And Duty. The world was lucky to have her devotion even though it came with a certain amount of getting sizzled. I believe the non-standard naming of her bridge in her honor by the DOT had to do with the fact she was actively dying of cancer at the time, and they wanted to tell her while she was still around to hear it. She was deeply moved; it was a kind decision!  I wanted to let you see her as a person, and one who cared deeply about her work and her state.
