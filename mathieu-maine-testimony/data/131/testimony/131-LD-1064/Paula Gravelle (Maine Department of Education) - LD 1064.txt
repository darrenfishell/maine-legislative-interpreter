In Support of: L.D. 1064 
An Act to Increase the Minimum Teacher Salary 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs

Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs:I 
My name is Paula Gravelle and I am here representing the Department of Education speaking in support of LD 
I064, An Act to Increase the Minimum Teacher Salary Our support of LD I064 is conditional upon the 
removal of the stipulation that beginning in 2028, increases to the minimum teacher salary will be tied to the 
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We understand, based on discussions with the sponsor, that this isa 
possibility. Additionally, we must keep in mind the availability of State funds that may change from year to 
year and and any impact those fluctuations may have on local SAU budgets. 
In 2019, the Mills Administration, with the help of the legislature, increased the minimum teacher salary to 
$40,000. While we believe this was an important step toward fairly compensating our teachers, the Department 
of Education and the Mills Administration agree that the $40,000 minimum teacher salary remains too low and 
should be increased to $50,000. The increases by year outlined in LD 1064 allow for school administrative units 
(SAUs) to benefit from State support as they work towards meeting a new $50,000 This method 
worked well for introducing the $40,000 minimum in 2019 and this is a good model for increasing the 
minimum again for the $50,000 Currently, only 4.22% of SAUs have their minimum salary for the 
equivalent of l FTE teacher at or above $50,000. The estimated total cost for Maine to increase the minimum 
teacher salary to $50,000 is approximately $28.6 million.~ 
The estimated phase-in costs over a 4-year period are as follows: 
FY 25 to bring all Teachers up to $42,500 = $4,087,823 
FY 26 to bring all Teachers up to $45,000 = $5,780,838 
FY 27 to bring all Teachers up to $47,500 = $8,566,189 
FY 28 to bring all Teachers up to $50,000 = $11,061,117 
These estimates do not account for typical annual salary increases. If it Were, these figures would be lower, but the DOE 
cannot reasonably calculate those amounts. For these reasons, the Department of Education is in support of L.D. 
I064 with the adjustments noted above. I would be happy to answer any questions the Committee may have, 
and I will be available for work sessions on this bill.
