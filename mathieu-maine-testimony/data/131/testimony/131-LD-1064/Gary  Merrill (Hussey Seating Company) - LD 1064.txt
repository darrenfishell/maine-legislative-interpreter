To whom  it may concern,  
 
I am writing to express my concern regarding the public education system in Maine, and specifically, the 
importance of fairly compensating  our professional educators. As a business leader responsible for over 
300 employees , I understand the critical role that education plays in preparing a well -educated 
workforce,  which is critical  to our success  as we compet e with companies  from around the world.  
It is troubling to  me that legislation establish ed a minimum salary fo r our educators. However, my greater 
concern is that the proposed minimum salary of $50,000 may not be enough to attract and retain highly 
qualified professionals with advanced degrees . Recruiting and retaining such individuals requires a salary 
that is si gnificantly higher than the minimum proposed in the legislation.  
I firmly believe that a strong education system is essential to the success of our state. This s ystem must 
prepare our children to pursue higher education in their chosen fields . 
Achieving th is objective requires that we invest in our educators by providing them with fair 
compensatio n for the important work they do.  
Thank you for your time ,
