Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on 
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs:
My
name
is
Matt
Bernstein,
I
am
a
resident
of
Portland
and
I
am
the
2023
Maine
T eacher
of
the
Y ear .
In
this 
testimony ,
I
am
writing
as
a
private
citizen
and
not
as
a
representative
of
any
school,
district,
or
or ganization.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
testimony
in
favor
of
LD
#1064.
I
ur ge
you
to
support
this
bill 
because
I
believe
that
raising
the
minimum
teacher
salary
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
increasing
and 
strengthening
the
teaching
workforce
in
Maine.
Data
shows
that
Maine,
like
many
states
across
the
country ,
is
experiencing
a
teacher
shortage.
A
recent
Maine 
Monitor
article
reveals
that
in
2022,
more
than
1,300
teachers,
education
technicians,
administrators
and
other 
educators
in
Maine
left
their
jobs,
and
927
educators
retired.
Both
numbers
represent
seven
year
highs.
It
is
imperative
that
we
take
action
to
address
this
shortage
so
that
we
can
ensure
that
Maine
students
have 
access
to
the
highest
quality
education
possible.
Right
now ,
so
many
schools
are
stretched
thin
because
of
a
lack 
of
staf f.
At
times,
teachers
are
being
asked
to
cover
classes
during
prep
periods,
which
in
turn
impacts
the 
ability
for
teachers
to
prepare
for
future
lessons,
or
schools
are
being
pushed
to
increase
class
sizes,
which
limits 
the
ability
for
teachers
to
provide
individualized
attention,
or
schools
are
unable
to
find
enough
staf f
to
support 
programming
at
their
school,
which
may
lead
to
cuts
that
limit
the
options
students
have
in
their
education.
For 
many
reasons,
when
we
do
not
have
enough
teachers,
the
quality
of
education
that
we
can
provide
goes
down.
While,
undoubtedly ,
the
causes
of
a
teacher
shortage
are
multifaceted
and
complex,
it
is
also
known
that
low 
salaries
play
a
role
in
people
choosing
not
to
pursue
teaching
as
a
career
or
teachers
choosing
to
leave
the 
profession.
When
I
was
in
college,
people
would
often
ask
why
I
was
pursuing
a
teaching
career ,
when
I
could 
make
more
money
in
other
fields.
Indeed,
my
student
teaching
cohort,
representing
seniors
and
post-grad 
students,
had
only
six
members.
W e
also
know
that
low
salaries
can
be
a
barrier
to
those
who
want
to
become 
teachers,
but
need
to
pursue
higher
paying
professions
to
pay
loans
or
support
their
families.
Finally ,
we
know 
that
the
cost
of
living
is
increasing
in
Maine
and
across
the
country .
W e
need
to
ensure
that
we
are 
compensating
our
starting
teachers
so
that
people
are
able
to
become
teachers
and
remain
in
the
profession 
without
undue
financial
burden.
In
my
experience,
I’ve
found
that
when
people
talk
about
teachers,
the
narrative
focuses
on
how
teaching
is
a 
calling
and
how
teachers
join
the
profession
as
an
act
of
service.
While
I
appreciate
these
sentiments
and
agree 
that
my
inspiring
colleagues
are
dedicated
and
selfless,
I
also
think
it
is
important
that
we
acknowledge
that 
teaching
is
a
profession
and
that
salary
is
an
important
component
of
attracting
and
retaining
teachers.
Indeed, 
like
any
profession,
if
we
want
to
attract
the
best
people
to
teaching,
we
need
to
be
of fering
competitive
salaries. 
Through
increasing
the
minimum
teacher
salary ,
I
believe
that
we
will
see
more
people
pursue
teaching
and 
more
starting
teachers
remain
in
the
field,
both
of
which
will
positively
impact
Maine
students
and 
communities.
Finally ,
I
believe
that
increasing
the
minimum
teacher
salary
will
communicate
an
important
belief
about 
teachers:
that
they
are
valued
professionals
deserving
of
compensation
that
reflects
their
importance
in
society . 
While
this
bill
focuses
on
minimum
salaries,
the
impact
of
passing
this
will
reach
all
teachers
because
it
will 
demonstrate
a
collective
support
from
the
state
and
a
unified
commitment
to
teachers.
This
bill
is
the
type
of 
positive
action
that
will
mean
a
lot
to
all
teachers.
For
all
these
reasons,
I
think
increasing
the
minimum
teacher
salary
would
help
improve
education
in
Maine.
I 
strongly
ur ge
the
Committee
to
vote
unanimously
ought
to
pass.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
this
testimony ,
and
for
considering
this
in
your 
deliberations.
