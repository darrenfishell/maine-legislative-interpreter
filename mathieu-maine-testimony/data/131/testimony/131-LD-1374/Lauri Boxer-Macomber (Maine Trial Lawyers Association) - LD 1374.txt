TESTIMONY OF ATTORNEY LAURI BOXER -MACOMBER  
On Behalf of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association  
 
LD 1374, HP088 – Ought to Pass  
An Act to Improve Driver Safety by Requiring the Comp letion of a Defensive Driving 
Course for Certain Violations  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  
Tuesday, April 18, 2023, 1:00 p.m.  
 
Good afternoon, Senator Chipman, Representative Will iams, and Members of the  
Committee on Transportation:  
 
My name is Lauri Boxer -Macomber. I am a resident of Portland, Maine and an 
attorney that represents victims of distracted driving an d other traffic trauma cases 
throughout the State  
of Maine. I offer this testimony in support of LD 1374  individually and on behalf of the 
Maine Trial Lawyers Association (the MTLA).   
 
Distracted driving is a public health epidemic that need s to be addressed 
proactively and reactively from every angle, including  driver education and re -
education.   
 
As members of the Transportation Committee are already  aware, distracted 
driving crashes take too many lives and injury too many  people. In addition, these 
crashes have significant secondary consequences on families, b usinesses, schools, 
hospital systems, municipalities, the State of Maine, and  even on state and federal 
taxpayers.   
 
When distracted drivers cause traffic crashes, children and  families often 
suffer, employers often lose employees and productivity,  and schools are often 
unfairly burdened with student and family trauma.  
 
In addition, hospitals often end up providing free an d reduced rate care to 
victims of distracted driving crashes, municipalities spend time, money and resources 
on emergency rescue and other public services, and state a nd federal benefit 
programs like MaineCare and Medicare can end up paying  the costs of the distracted 
driver’s negligence —especially when there is no other insurance or minimal  other 
insurance available.  
 
For these reasons, the MTLA urges passage.  legislation requiring a defensive 
driving. urse for distracted traffic infractions.  The $35 fee that a person who has 
committed a distracted driving traffic infraction will p ay to take a 23 M.R.S . § 4208  
defense driving course pursuant to this proposed legislati on is nominal in comparison 
to the amount of financial and other harm that the person may cause other people and the State of 
Maine if they do not receive education or re -education about Maine’s distracted driving laws and 
continue with the practice of driving distracted.  
 
We also urge the Legislature and the Department of P ublic Safety to consider making the 
defensive driving course 100% internet accessible at the  statutory rate of $35, ideally with options 
for members of the public to take the course in multipl e languages.   
 
Should the Maine Legislature or the Maine Department  of Public Safety wish to review a 
model for using online distracted driving instructional programs to: (1) help enforce distracted driving 
laws in a fair and equitable way, (2) reduce traffic cr ashes caused by distracted drivers, and (3) 
ultimately prevent deaths and injuries caused by distra cted drivers, these bodies may wish to 
consider efforts already well underway in the State o f Oregon.  See Reducing Distracted Driving in 
Oregon: An  Interdisciplinary Approach to a Statewide P roblem  located at: https://www.oregon.gov/ 
odot/Safety/Documents/DistractedDrivingReport.pdf; see also ORS 811.507 Operating Motor 
Vehicle While Using Mobile Electronic Device located at:  https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ 
ors_811.507; and see  ORS 811.508 Distracted Driving Avoidance Course located  at: https:// 
oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_811.508  
 
Thank you for your consideration of this legislation and  service to the State of Maine. Please 
let me know if the MTLA or I can be of assistance to you  as you consider ways to tackle the 
distracted driving problem on Maine’s roadways.  
 
Best regards,  
 
 
Lauri Boxer -Macomber
