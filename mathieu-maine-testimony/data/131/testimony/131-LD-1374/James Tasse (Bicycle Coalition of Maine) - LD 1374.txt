and
the
distinguished

My
name
is
James

and
I
am
the
Assistant
Director
of
the

Our
mission
is
to

On
behalf
of
our
more
than
20,000

I
am
submitting
this

in
support
of
LD

amendments.
The
BCM
believes
that
passing
this

with
the

proposed
below ,
will
help
promote

for
vulnerable

For
these
reasons,
the
BCM
ur ges
an
“Ought

Pass

Amendment”
report
from
the
committee.
This
bill
would
require
a

course

violations
of
statute
that
prohibit
distracted

W e
support
this
measure,
but
we
do
not
feel
that
it
goes
enough.
The
BCM
therefore
recommends
that
this
bill
be
amended
so
as
to
require
that
the
same
or
a
similar
course
be
taken
for
any
violation
that
involves
vulnerable
users
as
defined
in
Maine
State
Law
T itle

The
BCM
ur ges
an
Ought
to
Pass,
with
the

proposed
above.
Thank
you
for

Testimony in Support of LD 1374 with Amendments
An Act to Improve Driver Safety by Requiring the Completion 
of a Defensive Driving Course for Certain Violations
Greetings Chairs Chipman and Williams and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
My name is James Tassé and I am the Assistant Director of the Bicycle Coalition of 
Maine (BCM).  Our mission is to make Maine better and safer for bicycling and 
walking.  On behalf of our more than 20,000 members and supporters, I am 
submitting this testimony in support of LD 1374 with amendments. The BCM 
believes that passing this bill, with the amendment proposed below, will help promote
roadway safety, in particular for vulnerable users.  For these reasons, the BCM urges 
an “Ought to Pass with Amendment” report from the committee.  
This bill would require a driver to take a remedial driver education course for 
violations of statute that prohibit distracted driving, texting while driving, or driving 
with an electronic device in hand.  We support this measure, but we do not feel that it 
goes enough.  
The BCM therefore recommends that this bill be amended so as to require that the 
same or a similar course be taken for any violation that involves vulnerable users as 
defined in Maine State Law Title 29-A §101, including but not limited to violations 
under §2056 (Pedestrians), §2057 Sub 10 (Traffic Control Devices), §2060 (Turning 
at Intersections), §2070 (Passing).  
The BCM urges an Ought to Pass, with the amendment proposed above. 
 
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely,
James Tassé
Assistant Director
Bicycle Coalition of Maine
