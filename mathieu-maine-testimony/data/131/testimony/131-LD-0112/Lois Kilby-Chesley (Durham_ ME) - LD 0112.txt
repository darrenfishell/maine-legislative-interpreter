To Labor and Housing Committee
From Lois Kilby-Chesley
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee.
My name is Lois Kilby-Chesley, and I am writing to you from my home in Durham, 
ME.
I am writing in support of LD 112 - An Act to Increase the State’s Share of Retired 
Teacher Health Insurance.
I loved my career in education, but honestly, the financial impacts of my career 
choice continue to haunt me in retirement.  The MEPERS check I receive along with 
the Social Security check that is reduced through the GPO/WEP fiasco, means I make
tough financial choices every day.  If a few more dollars were available from the 
State’s contribution to health insurance, the choices might be a little easier.
There was a time when the State had a goal of 100% payment for teacher health 
insurance.  Unfortunately between the good intentions and now, the state share stuck 
at 45% for years before recently increasing to 55%.
What we retired teachers need now is for the State to begin to make good on the 20 
year old promise.to move toward paying 100% of health insurance.  The first step 
would be to move in 5% increments from 55%.  In 2023 on July 1, that means raising 
to 60%, 65% in July 2024, and so on until we reach 100%.  Health care is not just a 
necessity, in my opinion, it is a right. 
I made a promise to teach my students to the best of my ability, to protect them and 
nurture them, to help them become engaged citizens with the skills to be successful 
adults.  The State should also be keeping the promise it made two decades ago.
Thank you for the work you do for teachers and all residents of our State.
