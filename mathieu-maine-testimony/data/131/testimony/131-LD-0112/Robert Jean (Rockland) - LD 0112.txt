Robert Jean
Rockland
LD 112
My name is Bob Jean from Rockland.  I am a retired teacher who taught for 38 years in 
Rockland Area schools. I am speaking today in support of LD112.
Every month,  a hefty chunk of money comes out of my pension check to cover health 
insurance.  The progress we've made with a 55% state contribution is appreciated and helpful
but I believe we could do more for our retired teachers.
During my teaching career many of my 2nd and 3rd jobs were in the field of education which 
means that I paid into Maine State Retirement as opposed to social security.  It also means 
that I don't qualify for 100% Medicare coverage. I am not alone- other retirees face the same 
situation of monthly health insurance payments.
Combine this with a cost of living adjustment (COLA) that probably won't come close to 
keeping up with inflation, there is no question that the value of my pension continues to 
shrink.  My level of comfort is decreasing as well.
We need to find solutions.  The passage of this bill would point us in the right direction and 
offer a glimmer of hope.
I thank the members of this committee for your time and your service. Please consider 
moving forward with LD 112.
Thank you.
