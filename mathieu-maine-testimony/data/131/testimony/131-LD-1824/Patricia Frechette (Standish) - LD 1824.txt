Dear Committee Members:
I do not think that this is an appropriate time to establish a commission to study the 
Maine Constitution.  
We are a small state and creating the position of Lieutenant Governor just adds to 
bigger government.  
Many Maine residents live in sparse areas and have limited availability to their 
representatives now.  By reducing the number of members of the Legislature you 
restrict their ability to have representation.
By establishing a unicameral Legislature, it seems to me that our election processes 
will be compromised.
I ask that you vote NOT to PASS,  Thank you.
