Honorable Chairs, Member of the Judiciary Committee:
I am Greg Robie, the initiator of the evolving document the "131st Legislature's 
Beltway of Bills snookering Maine" (most recent version uploaded and attached to 
my testimony regarding LD 1611). 
While digging deeper into the IRA's duplicitous "clean" hydrogen text this morning 
(which is integral to LD 1775), I was made aware of this Resolve. The Portland Press 
suggest the resolve would tend to reduce the power of the Legislative Branch. 
Considering the analysis of the content and substance of the bills in the 
#BeltwayOfBills, a review of how power is shared and balanced in the governance of 
our State among its branches could benefit from a review such as would be integral to
this resolve. 
given the exploited loophole in our solar decommissioning law by stacks of LLCs 
having DEP applications accepted and reviewed as though they are a person under 
law (which they are not), there is abuse of power. What currently limited the 
Legislature's power is that routine technical rulemaking is treated as an optional duty 
regarding a delegated legislative power (even the Legislators' Handbook 
misrepresents this). 
In my experience, Constitutional rights preserved under our MAPA, are run 
roughshod over due to a practice of rulemaking that circumvents those rights; has led 
to an imbalance in the balance of powers. Regulations, more so than rulemaking, 
dominate executive governance.
Thank you for considering this testimony. I am happy to explain further if such is 
helpful.
=)
