Republican Cory Reynolds
LD 1037
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee:
My name is Cory Reynolds and I live in Waterville. I am a self-advocate, meaning I 
am a person who lives with a disability. I am also a Republican in politics. 
I am in support LD 1037 because I have workers that support me in my home and in 
the community, and if they were not, there it would be too difficult for me or other 
individuals to live on their own or need the help in the community.
I respect the work that DSPâ€™s do, and I believe they should be paid a better wage. I 
ask you to vote in favor of LD 1037.
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
