My son who was born with Downâ€™s syndrome has been in the same group home for 
over 30 years. This is home to him, the staff that work here are like a second family to
him. Changes in staff are unsetting  to all the clients that live in these homes. The staff
has to learn how to give out medication, learn medical procedures and have 
background checks in order to qualify for the job. Not just everyone qualifies for 
positions or have the compassion to care for the variety of individuals that live in 
these homes. I have seen first hand how staffing shortages disrupt the daily routine in 
these home which is important to all the clients. Please consider making the wages for
the people who work in these home competitive in this environment . A better pay 
means more help that will stay and lessen the load of those who have to work 
overtime just to cover the positions that need full time staff at all times. Thank you for
your consideration.
