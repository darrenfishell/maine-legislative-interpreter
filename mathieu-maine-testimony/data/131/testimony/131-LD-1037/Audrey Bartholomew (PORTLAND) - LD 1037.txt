LD 1037
I am writing in support of LD 1037: An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct 
Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities.  Increasing the wage for direct 
care workers is critical.  The ability to obtain provider services is extremely difficult 
and leads to individuals with disabilities not being able to participate in their 
community and pursue employment.  Increasing the wage would open up the potential
workforce and lead to a system of supports that is consistently staffed by individuals.  
There would be less turnover and lead to a workforce that is experienced and trained.  
I work at a university in Maine and have many students in my courses who want to 
work in a field supporting individuals with disabilities.  Unfortunately, the current 
salary for direct care workers makes it almost impossible for my students to pursue 
this line of employment when they graduate.  Increasing the pay to 157% of Maine's 
minimum wage would legitimize this work and make it a viable option for a wide 
variety of individuals including those who have bachelor's degrees.  
I appreciate your consideration of this bill.
