Testimony in Support of LD 1037 “An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct 
Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities”   
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee: 
 
My name is Eric McVay and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also a member of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s 
Self-Advocacy Network.  I am also a board member of Disability Rights Maine, and Self-
Advocates Becoming Empowered representing Region 8 which includes Maine.   
 
I am in support of LD1037 because I know what a struggle it has been for agencies to 
hire and retain a good strong workforce.   This is at a time when some staff have left to 
go to other agencies or to other industries for better pay.   This field that we are in, 
serving people with disabilities, should offer competitive paying positions.    
This should be a career path not a steppingstone to positions outside of serving people 
with disabilities.   
 
Staff turnover has affected people that I know.   When there aren’t enough staff people 
don’t get the service hours that they are supposed to get.  This means lost community 
support time and lost home support time.   
 
I ask you to vote in support of LD 1037 to support people with disabilities who receive 
services.   
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Eric McVay
