I am the manager of The Art Department, a community support program in Portland. 
We provide studio space for artists with a variety of intellectual and developmental 
disabilities, set up opportunities for the people that we support to display and sell their
art in our gallery or in a variety of community sites throughout Southern Maine. Three
of my participants currently have designs of theirs for sale in a boutique in The Old 
Port.  One of my participants just won a design competition with Portland Downtown 
which means that an Adirondack chair with their design will be set up in downtown 
Portland all summer long.  The community connections that we work so hard to 
establish earn folks that attend our program money and more importantly fill them 
with pride and a sense of belonging in the community.  It would be impossible for me 
to offer these opportunities if I wasn't blessed with the compassionate, creative, and 
dedicated staff that I have the privilege to work with every day.  I am finding it more 
and more difficult to find the talented people that I need to make my program work 
when the wages that I am able to offer are so low.  It is not enough to offer people a 
rewarding and fulfilling career.  They need to be able to keep a roof over their heads 
and food on their table.  It is clear to me that if we want to continue supporting some 
of the most vulnerable folks in the meaningful way that they all deserve, we need to 
offer the staff that supports them a wage that reflects the importance of the work they 
do and not make them feel like the practical decision is to take a position at Starbucks 
or McDonald's because the pay is better.
