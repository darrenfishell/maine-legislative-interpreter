Testimony of Representative Laurie Osher introducing 
LD 1037, An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct Support 
Professionals for Persons with Disabilities 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Senator Baldacei, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, I am Laurie Osher and I represent District 25, the majority of Orono. Thank 
you for the opportunity to introduce and express my support for LD 1037, An Act to Fund 
Competitive Wages for Direct Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities. 
This legislation would increase the labor reimbursement rate for home and coinmunity-based and 
residential services under MaineCare from 125% of the minimum wage to 157%. 
As many members of the committee will recall, the 130th Legislature raised the reimbursement 
rate to 125% as part of the 2021 supplemental budget. We did so based on the recommendation 
of the 2019 Commission to Study Long—term Care Workforce Issues, which issued its ﬁnal report 
in January 2020, stating that 125% of the minimum wage should be the ﬂoor for starting direct 
care worker wages.‘ We recognized that this critical workforce faces challenges that prevent 
Maine people from receiving the care and support they need - and that a solution could not wait. 
But when the Commission to Study Long-term Care Workforce Issues met, there was no way for 
them to know just how signiﬁcant the problems they sought to address would soon become. Just 
weeks after the commission issued its final report, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Maine. If 
our direct care workforce faced challenges before the pandemic, it is now truly in crisis.

I was here in 2021 and was proud to support the increased reimbursement rates, but it wasn’t 
enough then, and it certainly isn’t enough now. LD 1037 seeks to bring the solution more in line 
with the severity of the workforce shortages We face today. 
There are Mainers here today who can speak to the impact that adequate funding for direct care 
provider wages would have on their daily lives. Thank you for your consideration of this 
proposal and their personal experiences. 
Please vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1037.
