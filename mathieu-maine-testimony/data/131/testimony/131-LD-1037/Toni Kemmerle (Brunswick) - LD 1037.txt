LD 1037
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee,
As the parent of a young man with autism who has many challenges in carrying out 
activities of daily living, I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1037.  The increase 
of the support worker reimbursement rate to %157 percent is crucial to the 
maintenance of a viable system  of home and community-based supports and 
residential services for individuals with IDD like my son. Insufficient reimbursement 
rates make it extremely difficult for residential service providers to operate. Many of 
them are closing some of their group homes or ceasing to offer residential services 
entirely. The Department will tell you that this situation is a matter of staffing 
shortages, but staffing shortages are tied directly to low wages. A living wage will go 
far to address staffing shortages.
