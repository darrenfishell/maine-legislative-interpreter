I am writing this because my son has lived in a group home for people with 
developmental disabilities for over 20 years.   Direct Support Providers (DSP)  
provide Matthew’s day to day care.  They are grossly underpaid due to the pay rate 
not keeping up with minimum wage.
DSPs are vital to the ongoing success of organizations such as the one my son is 
involved with.   They are required to get ongoing specialized training to provide 
services for people with challenging behaviors. They manage the lives of several 
consumers at a time day in and day out.  It takes a special kind of person to do this 
work.  They cook and clean for them, supervise hygiene, distribute medication, drive 
them to activities and jobs, supervise them in the community, support them when they
are afraid or sick.  We parents entrust our children’s lives to these people and want to 
see them paid well for all of their hard work.  Please provide the funding to pay them 
their due and to ensure that our most vulnerable population are well cared for.
