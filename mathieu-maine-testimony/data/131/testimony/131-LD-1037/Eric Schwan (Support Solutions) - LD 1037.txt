I have worked in the field as a DSP and as a supervisor for DSPs for a community 
support program for over ten years and am continuously amazed at the incredible 
work DSPs do to support individuals in community integration and professional 
skills, and appalled at how little they are paid and how little support they receive. 
Competitive wages are long overdue and the issue has only been exacerbated by the 
pandemic, the staffing crisis, and the rising cost of living in Maine. Please recognize 
how dire a situation this is and how staffing directly impacts the lives of the countless 
individuals living with disabilities in our state and fund DSP wages at 157% of 
minimum wage so they have a shot at stabilizing and staying in this field, and 
individuals supported are not constantly left without staff or with an incredibly high 
turnover rate for people who directly impact their lives and make a difference. Thank 
you.
