LD 1037
We are raising a grandson with Down Syndrome.  He is now 24 and attends Coastal 
Opportunities which is a wonderful program.   At this time only 2 mornings are 
available for him to attend because they are short staffed.  The employees are not 
making a fair compensation for their work.    I would strongly ask that you please 
pass  LD 1037 so that the employees that do this kind of work will be compensated 
for the very important work that they do.  Thank you for your consideration.
