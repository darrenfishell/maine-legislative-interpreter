Testimony in Support of LD 1037 “An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct 
Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities”   
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee: 
 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. 
 
I am in support of LD 1037 because I think that DSP’s need to get a higher wage.   It is 
important to have consistency in our support staff.   Many are having to make the 
decision to leave their position of being a DSP and take a job where they are paid a 
higher wage.    
 
It is important that support staff can view this as a career path and not just a job.   They 
should not have to worry about their income and instead be able to focus on supporting 
people.    
 
It will help support staff feel valued and confident if they are paid a competitive wage.  
When we show the value of paying support staff a competitive wage, we show the value 
of the people they are supporting.   
 
I have seen numerous times where people that I know are suddenly without support 
staff because they left for a higher paying job.   This puts the person with a disability in a 
tough spot.  When people are left without a support person, then they lose out on their 
community support time and home support.    
 
I am asking you to support LD 1037.   
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
