LD 1037
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: 
My name is David Cowing, and I live in Woolwich. My son receives Section 21 
services and lives in a group home in Bath due to his intellectual and other 
disabilities. I strongly recommend that you support LD 1037 (An Act to Fund 
Competitive Wages for Direct Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities).
My son faces many physical, behavioral, and mental health challenges. The staff that 
support him must be skilled professionals, and should be recognized as such. The 
quality of his life day-to-day is wholly dependent on the quality of his staff--the 
Direct Support Professionals--who support him daily. But DSPs often come and go in 
what seems like a revolving door. They usually leave for better pay elsewhere in order
to support their own families. However, that leaves my son with the need to become 
familiar and comfortable with someone new (if someone with the necessary skills can 
even be found willing to work for the wage being offered). 
I know that the pandemic created additional challenges to hiring DSPs, and that 
dozens of group homes have been forced to close in Maine. It has been progressively 
harder for agencies to hire and retain the DSPs needed to support individuals like my 
son and all the other Mainers with intellectual and other disabilities. 
The question of who will oversee the services that our son requires when we are gone 
is a regular source of worry for both me and my wife. What will happen when we are 
gone is a question constantly weighing on our minds--a worry that can make for many
sleepless nights.
Please support LD 1037. Allow agencies to pay a competitive wage to their dedicated 
DSPs (like those that work with our son) for the vital work they do.
Thank you,
David Cowing
Woolwich
