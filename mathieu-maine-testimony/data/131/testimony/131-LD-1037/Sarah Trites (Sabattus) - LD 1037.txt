Testimony in Support of LD 1037 “An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct 
Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities”   
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee: 
 
My name is Sarah Trites and I live in Sabattus. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also a member of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s 
Self-Advocacy Network. 
I am in support LD 1037 because I have workers coming to support me in my home and 
if they were not, it would be too difficult for me to live on my own.    
I respect the work that they do, and I believe they should be paid a competitive wage.   
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1037. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Sarah Trites 
Sabattus
