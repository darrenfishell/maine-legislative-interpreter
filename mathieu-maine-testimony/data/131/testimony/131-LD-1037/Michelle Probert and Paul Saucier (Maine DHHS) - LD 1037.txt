Re:  LD 1037  – An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct Support Professionals for Persons 
with Disabilities  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services : 
 
This letter is submitted in  opposition  to LD 1037 , An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for Direct 
Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities . This bill amends the law governing essential 
support worker reimbursement under MaineCare or state -funded home and community -based 
services and residential services by increasing the rate for the labor portion of reimbursement to 
157% of the minimum wage as well as reimbursement f or taxes and benefits directly related to 
the labor portion.  
 
Maine has made significant improvements to reimbursement for direct support workers. The 
Department implemented the Commission to Study Long -term Care Workforce’s 
recommendation to increase rate s in MaineCare and other state -funded programs to ensure the 
labor component is equal to at least 125% of the minimum wage (Part AAAA of P.L. 2021, ch. 
398). This change was implemented for several long-term services and supports effective  
January 1, 2022.  Other services received monthly “ramp” payments in 2022  as the Department 
conducted rate studies to be able to determine necessary investment amounts , followed by  
permanent rate adjustments effective January 1, 2023. Nursing homes and certain residential 
homes received an interim supplemental wage add -on to their rates from January to June 2022 
for Part AAAA, followed by permanent increases in July 2022. Services that received the 
January 1, 2022,  and July 1, 2022 rate increases received further adjustment s effective January 1, 
2023,  to keep pace with the increasing minimum wage , as required by Part AAAA, as well as  
with general inflation.  
 
There were additional investments benefiting  the direct care workforce as well. Home and 
community -based pro viders received over $120 million in payments from the American Rescue 
Plan in February 2022 to provide bonuses to direct support workers and their supervisors.  
Providers of certain behavioral health and care coordination services received an additional $1 2 
million in June 2022, and Children’s Residential Care Facilities received nine million in two 
payments between  fiscal years 2022 and 2023 : both payments were intended to provide relief to 
direct care workforce challenges and otherwise support stabilizati on and expansion of service 
capacity .    
 
  
The Department believes time is needed to assess the impact of these positive changes to direct 
support workers before determining if additional support is necessary.  It is currently in the 
process of collecting an d analyzing data to assess the impact of these services.  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
Sincerely,
