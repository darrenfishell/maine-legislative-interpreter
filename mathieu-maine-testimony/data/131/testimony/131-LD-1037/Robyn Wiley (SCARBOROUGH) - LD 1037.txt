My name is Robyn Wiley and I have worked as a DSP at various points over the last 
15 years and have struggled to pay my bills on this salary, even when working 
full-time. Working with people with disabilities can be a rewarding job and provide 
great benefits to the person receiving services, but it's very difficult to stay in the field
when the pay is so low, especially given the amount of energy needed to put into the 
work. DSP's do very important work and are under more stress than ever with the 
staffing crisis here in Maine and need to be paid fairly to stay in the field and to do 
their best work. Individuals receiving DSP services deserve quality support 
professionals who are paid well and who are not chronically stressed about finances 
and making ends meet. Thank you for your consideration.
