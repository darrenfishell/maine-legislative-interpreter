Kindly increase the reimbursement for workers who care for adults with disabilities.  
The current worker shortage places persons, including my own adult children who 
have disabilities, at risk for their safety and well-being.  
Without a reasonable pool of applicants from which to draw, and the funds to 
reimburse them for their skills, less qualified personnel and a shortage of staff present 
risks to disabled residents' safety.  
The United States Census Bureau's Household Survey for 2022 found that persons 
with disabilities are three times more likely to experience physical harm during a 
natural disaster, for example.  These are vulnerable persons.   
Across the state, some group homes have had to close due to inadequate staffing, 
leaving persons with disabilities without access to safe care and housing.  Please 
make this crisis a budget priority.  Thank you.
