I'm passionate and proud of the work I do but I'm finding it increasingly difficult to 
keep my job as a Direct Support Professional because I am not making a living wage. 
The job position does not pay enough for me to deal with the increases in living, such 
as rent, transportation, utilities and food. 
We treat our clients with respect and dignity. We're qualified individuals who are 
connecting out clients to the community in fulfilling ways by sharing their creative 
and unique skills. We should be paid just as much as those working in other 
industries, and enough to live without working several jobs.
