I am writing today in support of LD 1037 "An Act to Fund Competitive Wages for 
Direct Support Professionals for Persons with Disabilities". 
I am currently the Program Manager at a community support program in Biddeford 
and have worked as a DSP for the past 9 years. Throughout this time, Maine, along 
with the rest of the country, has been mired in a Direct Support staffing crisis. I am 
sure that others more eloquent than myself will provide the relevant statistics and 
numbers that clearly outline this longstanding problem and I am also sure that by this 
point most of us are familiar with the recommendations towards fixing this â€“ top of 
the list being increased wages for direct support workers.  
Very simply put: we are currently watching this system crumble around us. We have a
choice to continue to watch this happen along with the disastrous consequences that 
follow, or to begin to fix the issues, of which increasing wages are a huge step. 
Additionally, at least in community supports the current reimbursement structure does
not allow for even the 125% of minimum wage though, to my knowledge, there has 
not been any release of the methodology used to justify the lack of increased 
reimbursement. We were only recently able to offer our staff a starting wage of 
$16.45/hr which creates a giant obstacle in attracting and retaining skilled, capable, 
caring and dedicated staff. The participants that our staff support are often employed 
in jobs that provide higher wages and very likely more opportunities for advancement.
Providing wages that allow direct support staff to sustain even the most modest of 
lives without taking on second (or third) jobs or working exorbitant overtime should 
not only be the bare minimum but is a moral imperative to live up to the ideals that 
we claim to hold. 
Thank you,
