Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 684, An Act to Implement Pilot Programs with Publicly Funded Day Care and Early 
Childhood Education , which seeks to develop and implement Educare -like mod els in three ( 3) 
service centers, one of which must be Rockland.  
The Educare and Elevate (rural version) models are the basis of LD 1712, which was enacted by 
Public Law 2021, Chapter 457 and  which establishe d the First4ME initiative.   First4ME sites  
will support two -generation, community -based approach es for coordinated birth to kindergarten -
entry program s that integrat e comprehensive resources and services into childcare settings. Non -
profit organizations coordinate early care and education programming  as well as whole family 
coaching  through partnerships between  Head Start,  childcare, Child Development Services, 
public schools, and other community -based providers/resources.   
This bill is consistent with current initiatives designed to better support c hildren and families in 
the years leading to school entry by coordinating resources to meet needs and by strengthening 
transitions from the 0 -5 years to the K -12 years. These initiatives include the previously noted 
Educare, Elevate, and First4ME models as  well as the First 10 School -Community model.  The 
Department of Educationâ€™s community school initiative and school -based health centers are 
other examples of related models.   
First4ME is already funded and just getting underway with applications this spr ing and initial 
implementation starting this summer . The First 10 Community School pilot will also be 
implemented over the next three years .  Studying the outcomes of these model s will help  to 
determine if expansion would address the needs this bill is seeking to target.  
This bill also raises some questions that would need to be addressed before implementation. For 
instance, would school administrative units ( SAUs ) be responsible for the ov ersight of the model 
or would a community partner (e.g. , CAP) be taking the lead as happens in the Elevate and 
Educare models?  Will needs assessments be required to determine grantee capacity, and where 
grant funding should be targeted?  To what extent woul d SAUs be responsible for coordination of 
Child Development Services (CDS) , Head Start, E arly Childhood Consultation Project (ECCP) , 
Home Visiting, and other early care and education partners?

The Department of Education remains committed to early childhood learning and is interested in 
exploring creative opportunities for programs such as this. We do also want to be mindful of the 
additional requests we place on our SAUs as we seek solutions. The Department will be 
available to provide additional information  on LD 684, An Act to Implement Pilot Programs 
with Publicly Funded Day Care and Early Childhood Education and respond to  any questions 
during the upcoming work session.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Lee Anne Larsen  
Director of Early Learning
