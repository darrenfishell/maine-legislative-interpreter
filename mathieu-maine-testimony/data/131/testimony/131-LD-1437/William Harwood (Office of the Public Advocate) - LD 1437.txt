 Testimony In Support of  
LD 1437, “An Act to Address Poverty by Increasing Access to Energy Efficiency and 
Weatherization Programs ” 
May 1 , 2023 
 
Senator  Pierce , Representative  Gere  and distinguished m embers of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Housing , 
 My name is William Harwood, testifying  as Public Advocate in support of  LD 1437 , “An 
Act to Address Poverty by Increasing Access to Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Programs .” 
 The Electric Ratepayer Advisory Council and OPA supports automatic enrollment of low -
income ratepayers in the PUC administered LIAP program. Currently less than 50% of eligible 
ratepayers actually receive LIAP benefits. Unfortunately, many of the approxima tely 75,000 – 
100,000 qualifying households with income below 200% of the federal poverty guideline are unable 
or unwilling to go through the time consuming and cumbersome application process administered 
by CAP agencies.  
 The OPA is actively working with DHHS and is hopeful that DHHS can administratively 
make adjustments to its application process to allow DHHS to simply notify the appropriate utility 
that one of its residential customers qualifies for automatic enrollment in the LIAP program.  
Thank you for your time, attention , and consideration of this testimony. The Office of the 
Public Advocate looks forward to work ing with the Committee on LD 1437  and will be available for  
the work session to assist the Committee in its consideration of th is bill.  
 
Respectfully  submitted , 
    
William S. Harwood  
Public Advocate
