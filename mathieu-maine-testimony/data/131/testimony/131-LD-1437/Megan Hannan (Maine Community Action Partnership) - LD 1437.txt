207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1437 An Act to 
Address Poverty by Increasing Access to Energy Efﬁciency and 
Weatherization Programs 
April 28, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Special Committee 
on Housing, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership, the membership organization of the ten 
Community Action Agencies in Maine, andwe support the Sponsors 
Amendment to LD 1437 An Act to Address Poverty by increasing Access 
to Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Programs. 
Our state's_greatest resource is our people, and our state‘s policies 
shape people’s possibilities. In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a famiIy’s capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the famiIy‘s well-being, we let them1 
drive their own story, and we have tangible success. 
To that end, among other programs and services, we administer the 
Home Energy Assistance Program for heating (HEAP) and for many 
years that program was the gateway to the Low Income Assistance 
Program for electricity (LIAP). That rule changed recently at the request 
of AARP, Maine Equal Justice and MeCAP, allowing people to contact 
their electricity provider for assistance directly. 
MaineHousing also just added TANF enrollment as a presumptively 
eligible program, at our and others’ request for many years. This is the 
first year that has been the case, and it certainly looks successful. You 
may have heard that, for the ﬁrst time, this year we used our entire 
Federal HEAP grant, providing a heating benefit to over 47,000 
households, an increase of 18.7% (9,319) compared to this same time 
year. It could be the presumptive eligibility, it could be the downside of 
the pandemic, but in either case, we are reaching more Maine families, 
and that is our goal. 
As far as the success of the LIAP program changes, my understanding 
is that there is still a lot of confusion about this change; customers call 
their utility to be told they need to contact their local Community Action 
Agency and if they are not HEAP customers we are telling them to 
contact their utility. I have attached the letter that DHHS sent to its 
customers for your information. 
I was not a part of the discussions between DHHS Office of Family 
Independence (OFI), the PUC and MaineHousing, but I have been in 
similar discussions about sharing information and it is not an easy ask.. 
We and others have been asking for more programs to use 
presumptive eligibility so that more individuals and families can access 
the programs and sen/ices to which they are entitled, while cutting the
layers of applications they must endure at least once, often more than once, per year. To reach that end, you 
have our support in all things relating to streamlining beneﬁts for people in poverty. ln spite of what some 
people assume, living in poverty is not easy. It is not necessarily a result of poor choices or personal failing. 
Most often, it is a result of systems that don’t work, or that confound problems in the way they do work. 
There have been several bills this session and certainly before which both address ﬁxing and exacerbating 
those systemic issues, and I won’t go into them now, but know that the lack of coordination and cooperation 
mean less effective programs. This amendment directs some of the much needed changes to fix that. 
I also have to say that the changes in LIAP, specifically, have been discussed and debated within the PUC 
and the Office of the Public Advocate, with interested stakeholders, the utilities and program administrators, 
and I imagine the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee would be very interested in this discussion. 
Thank you for your time and attention, l am happy to try to answer any questions you have.
