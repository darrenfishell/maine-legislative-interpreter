Befor e
the
Select
Committee
on
Housing
Good
morning
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere
and
respected
members
of
the
Select 
Housing
Committee.
My
name
is
Sophie
W arren,
and
I
represent
House
district
124.
Thank
you 
for
the
opportunity
to
present
LD
1437,
An
Act
to
Addr ess
Poverty
by
Incr easing
Access
to 
Energy
Efficiency
and
W eatherization
Pr ograms.
This
bill
and
its’
accompanying
Sponsor
Amendment
seek
to
address
longstanding
issues
of 
access
and
equity
to
ener gy
ef ficiency ,
weatherization
and
ener gy
burden
support
services
by 
reducing
a
critical
silough.
Both
the
bill
and
the
Amendment
are
rooted
in
the
critical
notion
that
transitions
we
make
as
a 
state
to
address
climate
change
must
work
in
line
with
equity
policies
that
prioritize
economic 
justice
and
day-to-day
services
so
many
Mainers
rely
on.
Ener gy
is
a
powerful
focus
of
our 
climate
change
goals,
but
a
just
transition
demands
we
work
as
collaboratively
as
possible
as
a 
state
to
protect
and
serve
all
Maine
people
and
leave
no
one
behind.
Sec.
1
of
this
bill
as-amended
will
specifically
name
ener gy
burden
–
a
cross-section
of
ener gy 
need
and
the
capacity
of
that
resident
to
pay
–
as
a
part
of
future
Reports
of
the
Maine
Climate 
Council.
Sec.
2
as-amended
greatly
sharpens
the
intent
of
the
section
from
the
broad
goal
listed
in
the
bill 
as-written:
“The
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
the
Maine
State
Housing
Authority 
and
the
Ef ficiency
Maine
T rust
shall
amend
their
rules
as
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
Home 
Ener gy
Assistance
Program
and
federal
Low
Income
Home
Ener gy
Assistance
Program 
resources
are
distributed
in
the
most
expedited
manner
possible.”
It
takes
work
from
the
Equity 
Subcommittee
of
the
Maine
Climate
Council
and
the
Recommendations
of
the
OP A ’ s
Ratepayer 
Advisory
Council
to
instruct
precisely
how
those
resources
shall
be
more
equitably
expedited.
Sec.
3
has
been
stricken
from
the
Amended
bill
after
discussion
with
advocacy
groups
and 
administrators
of
these
programs.

Sec.
4,
now
Sec.
3
of
the
bill
as-amended,
specifically
names
‘ener gy
burden’
as
a
focus,
where 
the
combination
of
ener gy
ef ficiency
and
weatherization
was
determined
by
administrators
of 
these
programs
as
painting
with
too
broad
a
brush.
T o
make
the
most
impact,
this
revised 
language
addresses
where
some
ef ficiency
and
some
weatherization
methods
may
not
be 
mutually
beneficial
depending
on
the
needs
of
the
individual,
the
realities
of
the
home,
and
the 
technologies
being
utilized
to
support
that
resident
with
an
ultimate
goal
of
reducing
ener gy 
burden.
Sec.
5,
now
Sec.
4
of
the
bill
as-amended,
is
a
recognition
of
the
way
information
is
held
and 
processed,
that
is
will
be
DHHS,
not
Maine
Housing
nor
Ef ficiency
Maine,
who
will
be 
responsible
for
the
capacity
and
processing
of
this
relevant
information.
The
problems
at
the
intersection
of
poverty
and
ener gy
need
is
nothing
new
to
so
many 
advocates
and
department
of ficials
who
I
know
have
been
researching
and
developing
methods 
to
bridge
these
very
administrative
hurdles
for
many
years.
T o
this
very
point,
where
the
bill
as-written
advocates
at
the
level
of
policy
‘goals’,
the
sponsor 
amendment
brings
back
from
the
relevant
parties
the
very
specific
proposals
and
directives
that 
are
based
on
that
ongoing
work
or
recommendations.
Y ou
will
see
the
ef forts
of
GOPIF
and
the 
Climate
Council’ s
Equity
Subcommittee
Final
Recommendations,
published
in
March
2023
in 
recommendations
in
Sections
1,
3
and
4
addressing
ener gy
burden.
Y ou
will
see
the
Of fice
of 
Public
Advocate’ s
Ratepayer
Advisory
Council
recommendations,
released
in
December
2022
in 
Section
2’ s
recommendations
on
LIAP .
Y ou
will
also
see
reflections
of
the
ongoing
work 
between
DHHS
and
MaineHousing
in
Section
4,
which
seeks
to
build
on
ongoing
work
they
are 
beginning
now
to
share
relevant
information
in
supporting
Maine
people
who
need
it
the
most.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
of
how
we
can
continue
and
further
our
ef forts
to 
address
our
long-standing
equity
issues
as
we
fight
climate
change.
I
am
happy
to
answer
any 
questions
that
you
have.
