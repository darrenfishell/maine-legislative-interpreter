Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Distinguished Colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, my name is Stacy Brenner. I 
represent Senate District 30, which includes all of Gorham and most of Scarborough. I am here to 
speak in favor of LD 132, “An Act to Require Health Insurance Carriers to Provide Coverage for_ 
Blood Testing for Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyﬂuoroalkyl Substances. ” 
This legislation would ensure that health insurance carriers provide coverage-for blood serum 
testing for _per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS. This bill stipulates that all 
plans renevved or beginning on January 1,2024 would include coverage for bloodserum testing of 
pFA$_e

Toxic per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (PEAS) or “forever chemicals ” accumulatesin our ,_ 
wastewater and contaminates. the.land and groundwaterdue to manufacturing processes, sludge 
applied to farmland, and the thousands of everyday products containing PFAS.- Forever chemicals 
pose signiﬁcant health risks, including kidney: cancer, reduced vaccine response, elevated . 
cholesterol, reduced infant birthweight, and more. Low income communities, communities of color, 
tribal, and rural communities are disproportionately impacted and more susceptible to health and 
ﬁnancial impacts of PFAS contamination. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 
children are disproportionately exposed due to“ . . ._lower body weight, differences in water andfood 
intake, developing organsystems and longer lifespans during which toxic effects might manifesti ”. 
Treatment for PFAS exposure is centered around assessing the patient- ’s level of exposure. High 
level exposure triggers regular screening to allowfor early detection of linked diseases. There is no 
approved procedure to remove the chemicalsfrorn exposed person’ts body, and the chemicals 
linger in the blood and organs for decades. The assessment of; personal exposure can help impacted 
families understand the risks and prevent additional future exposure.V

Many private 'Maine insurers leavehpatients to cover the full cost of the blood serum test unless the 
deductible has been reached. The average $600 per personcost of the serum test is currently 
-preventing PFAS impacted Mainers from assessing their exposure. The Affordable Care Act 
mandates that insurers mustcover the full cost ofa list of 10 essential health care beneﬁts including 
lab tests and preventative health care procedures. The PFAS blood serum test is both a lab test anda 
preventative health care procedure, since it allows patients to understand and mediate their exposure 
and screen for linked diseases. V

At least 25 Maine -schools anddaycare facilities have water supplies above Maine’s interim‘ 
drinking water standard of 20 parts per trillion, suggesting that 6,650 children and young adults 
currently enrolled at those schools have been exposed to high levels of PFAS while at school. 
There are 43 impacted schools and a total of 9,550 children exposed-above EPA-’s.draft drinkingT 
water standards, which arelower than Maine’s regulation. Maine DHHS is awaiting data on an 
additional 99 schools, and the number of exposed students is likely much higher. The total number 
of previously exposed alumni from these impacted schools would be hard to calculate.' 
Maine has identiﬁed at least 56 farms with documented PFAS contamination and over 380 private 
drinking wells in 22 Maine towns contaminated above the state’s interim safe drinking water 
standard in the ﬁrst tier of its sludge investigation. The state will likely discover more highly 
contaminated private wells as the investigation continues._ 
As chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee and co-‘chair of the PFAS Advisory 
Fund Committee, I- 
have heard ﬁrst handihow the issue of PFAS contamination has taken a- toll on 
our farmers and other rural communities with high levels of exposure. They are worried about their 
health "and the health of their families. We need to do -all we can to make sure that they are getting 
the healthcare that they need to manage the health impacts ‘of this toxic chemical. Early detection of 
PFAS-linked diseases could mean the difference between life and death for many Mainers. For- 
affected communities, especially children, accesstolPYFAS blood serum testing is essential to their 
medical needs. Mainers coping with these chemicals need -insurer-coveredaccess to the PFAS blood 
serumitest.~
