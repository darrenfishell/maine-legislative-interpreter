Dear committee members: 
At the time of PFAS contamination found in Maine, I lived in Fairfield. My spouse is 
a family physician, and she was at the forefront of testing for PFAS exposure for her 
patients. People with unbelievably high exposure to PFAS through their drinking 
water did not have the access to the necessary healthcare testing to determine how 
high the levels were in their bodies. It was a sad story at the time, for the relatively 
few people facing this predicament. 
I decided to test our well water for PFAS and found that we also had water highly 
contaminated with PFAS. The cost of the test is exorbitant, yet for those exposed, it is
clearly a medical necessity. We even opted to only have one of us in our family 
receive the test because it is so expensive. I had the test and learned that the levels in 
my blood were indeed highly elevated. 
Those of us exposed to PFAS, through no fault of our own, need the proper healthcare
provided by our insurance companies, so that we know what health risks we face. The
National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine makes it clear who is 
exposed, at risk, and should be covered for these tests. 
Please insure that those of us affected have reasonable access to the care we need. 
Thank you,
Nicholas Lykling
