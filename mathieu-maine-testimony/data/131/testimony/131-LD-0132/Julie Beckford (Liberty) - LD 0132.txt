Dear Committee members,
The PFAS disaster in Maine has wreaked havoc on people, land, water, and wildlife.  
I have been an organic farmer in Maine for 33 years.  Even though my land is not 
contaminated, I have very good friends whose lives have been turned upside down by 
the discovery of PFAS contamination on their land, in their water, and in their bodies.
They will be worrying about their health for the rest of their lives.  The Maine State 
Government permitted the spreading of sludge that resulted in this disaster.  I 
certainly hope that among the many measures the state takes to address this reality, 
requiring health insurance companies to pay for blood serum testing as it relates to 
PFAS, is one of them.  Please support LD 132.
Thank you.
