LD 132
I am writing in support of LD132 to require insurance carriers to cover the costs associated 
with blood serum tests to identify levels of PFAS contamination.  As we have come to realize 
the depths to which PFAS chemicals have poisoned our people and natural resources in 
Maine, it is imperative that we collect as much data as possible in order to chart a path 
forward.  Currently, the blood serum cost of $600 is prohibitive for many people who have 
been exposed.  Industrial contamination of our environment impacts all of us.  It is not right 
that only those who feel they can afford this testing have access to it.  These tests will not 
only contribute data to our understanding of the issue, but also can help individuals take 
precautions for their own health.  
Thanks for your consideration,
