LD 132
Please support and vote to pass LD 132.  It makes sense for medical insurance to 
cover this test because most people have already been exposed (aware and unaware) 
through no fault of their own along with the fact that there are multiple, different 
exposure sources that are completely unavoidable by humans i.eâ€¦ food packaging, 
produce & meats, school water supply, groundwater contaminated home wells, 
restaurants, in airplanes, household products, consumer products and more.  In 
addition most, including my family who already pays (employer sponsored health 
insurance) out of pocket premiums and deductibles of $8,000 plus the 20% uncovered
medical costs per year, cannot afford to pay another $450 if their doctor decides a test 
for PFAS is warranted.
