April 20, 2023 Subject: ”An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes” LD 1568 Dear Legislators: I am in favor of the bill, “An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes” being presented by Tiffany D. Roberts during your public hearing.  I have voted in every election that I can think of since I turned 21-years old, the legal age to vote for me at the time.  This September I will be 74-years old, and have never been intimidated by any person at the polls up until this past election. There was a man parked in the parking lot watching me bring my ballot to the drop box.  He made me uncomfortable, and I felt him watch my every move. I did not want to make eye contact, or engage with him in any way.  This is America. I have the right to safe access during any election at my town hall by placing my sealed ballot in the drop box, and should be able to walk away knowing that no one will try to open the box, and take my ballot from being counted. As a law abiding citizen, I urge you to vote in favor of LD 1568 to protect my right to vote, and insure my safety in public during any election. Thank you, George Carpinone 28 Liberty Street South Berwick, ME 03908 (207) 704-0216
