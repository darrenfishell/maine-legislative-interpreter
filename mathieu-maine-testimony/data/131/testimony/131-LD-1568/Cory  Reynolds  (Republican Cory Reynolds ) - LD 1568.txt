LD 1568
Good Morning, Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the 
Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, my name is Cory Reynolds and I am 
providing testimony in Opposition to LD-1568 - An Act to Protect Access to 
Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes. 
In The 2020 Presidential Election there was Election Fraud, People were voting with 
absentee ballots and going to the polls to vote, some people had ballots sent in that 
were dead. 
President Biden won the Election is because of fraud, the system was rigged just like 
the rest of our Government. This is not right what the Democratic leadership is doing, 
I ask you to please Vote Ought Not To Pass on LD-1568.
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
