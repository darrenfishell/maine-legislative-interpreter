LD 1568 ~ An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes 
Testimony opposing LD 1568 An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes 
Good Morning, LINDA HASKELL addressing the Speaker, Senators and Representatives of the committee 
I oppose amending Sec. 3. 21-A MRSA 674, sub- 1, H, not to be enacted. The addition of "Knowingly 
blocking or attempts to block access to a secured box" , is not needed in the Maine Constitution. 
l oppose amending Sec. 4. 21-A MRSA 753-B, sub- 8. The elimination of "open and maybe" must be left 
as printed in the Maine Constitution and the addition of "or receiving absentee ballots in a secured drop 
box" must not be added to the Maine Constitution, for the beneﬁt of aiding fraudulent ballots. 
The absentee ballot procedure, that We The People, have been operating under has served us well for 
years. lt has been rumored, there were numerous fraudulent ballots which were caught in the 2022 
election and more than likely numerous fraudulent ballots that were not caught in time. Numerous 
registered voters believe the 2020 & 2022 elections were not secure. 
l was informed by a delivery mail person, 4 town offices ballots were not picked up after the last election 
and Adrian Bennett was called and told the ballots had not been picked up. l was told, her reply was "oh 
that is OK, we have enough" . How many small town oiﬁces had this happen to them? l also heard there 
were many illegal ballots in Bradford, in the 2022 election. 
There must be many more pole watchers at the next election, it is our civic duty, to keep a careful watch 
over all of our elections and the Maine Constitution. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Are there any questions? 
I "100%" oppose LD1568. LINDA HASKELL Garland, Maine co-chair of the Republican party of Garland, 
Maine
