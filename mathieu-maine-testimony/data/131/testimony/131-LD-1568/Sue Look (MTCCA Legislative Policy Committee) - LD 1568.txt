Re: LD 1568 – An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes  
 
Position:  SUPPORT  
 
The Maine  Town  & City Clerks’  Association  is in support of  LD 1568 and we thank you for the 
opportunity  to outline  our points  for your Committee.  
 Although there aren’t known issues with voters being impeded or blocked from depositing 
their voted absentee ballot envelopes into drop boxes, scenes from other states reveal that 
this could happen in our state  and that it would be prudent  to be proactive and not wait for 
issues to arise before  providing  safeguards for voters.   
 The prohibition of the display of materials  around the clerks office that is  intended to 
influence a voter’s decision  on a current candidate or ballot issue during  the period when 
absentee voting is being conducted  is also supported by our members.   
 
The Maine  Town  & City Clerks’  Association  appreciates  the opportunity  to share  its
 
testimony  with the Committee.  Should  any questions  arise,  please  feel free to contact  me at 
207)680- 4210 or by email:  pdubois@waterville -me.gov  .
