 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
In Support of  
 
LD 1568 - An Act to Protect Access to Absentee Ballot Drop Boxes  
 
April 21 , 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in support of LD 1568 
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For referenc e, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Mainers have become accustomed to having safe polling places to cast their ballots and 
dedicated election workers to conduct the elections. Due to the pandemic, the use of ballot boxes 
increased significantly and the LPC fully supports extending the assurance of a safe place, free of harassment or intimidation, to include ballot box locations.  
This method of absentee ballot return has been embraced by communities. Given that 
Maine has not seen negative incidents occur with the use of ballot boxes, the LPC feels it makes sense to ensure that persons who knowingly block or attempt  to block access to ballot drop boxes 
would be committing a Class E crime.  
We kindly ask you to  consider voting  ought to pass on LD 1 568. Thank you for  your time 
and for  considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
