L.D. 425 - An Act to Lower the Environmental impact of Consumers, increase Food Safety and 
Strengthen Consumer Choice by Ending the Ban on Single—use Plastic Shopping Bags 
Testimony of: Brian Beneski/DEP 
Public Hearing: March 1, 2023 
Page 2 of3 
In 2019, the Department testified in support of L.D. 1532, An Act to Eliminate Single- 
Use Plastic Carry-Out Bags, as this bill would substantially reduce the use of single-use 
plastics and resulting waste stream through waste reduction — the top rung of lVlaine’s 
solid waste hierarchy. L.D. 1532 was ultimately passed by the Legislature and was 
signed into law by the Governor on June 17, 2019 (PL 2019, c.346). Additionally, this 
law replaced a patchwork of differing local ordinances across Maine prohibiting various 
types of single use bags and the placing of different types of fees on use of the bags. 
The existing single-use plastic bag ban law supports Maine's waste hierarchy, 
encourages the use of re-usable bags, and keeps single-use plastic bags out of 
household recycling bins, trash, and off the landscape as litter by reducing the number 
of bags distributed to customers. The current law continues the requirement that 
retailers in Maine who provide allowable single-use plastic bags (such as produce bags) 
within the store collect these materials from the public for recycling. The passage of 
L.D. 425 would return Maine to the conditions prior to the passage of L.D. 1532, 
allowing the use of single-use plastic bags if retailers provided a place to recycle single- 
use plastic bags and film. In 2021, l also spoke in opposition to L.D. 39, L.D. 108, and 
L.D. 244, all of which would have essentially repealed the law restricting the use of 
single-use plastic bags. 
The economic and safety benefits of keeping single-use plastic bags out of household 
recycling bins is significant, as they are one of the most problematic materials received 
at recycling and materials recovery facilities (MRFs) such as ecomaine ’s Portland 
facility ‘ or Casella‘s Lewiston facilityz . Plastic bags lock up the sorting equipment at 
recycling facilities, which requires the entire facility to be shut down in order to clear out 
the equipment, posing both a worker safety issue and an economic issue, not to

mention decreasing the capacity and speed of the facility ’s ability to process 
recyclables? ’ 
For the reasons stated earlier, the Department does not support the repeal of the single 
use plastic bag ban law, and strongly encourages its continuation in order to promote 
waste reduction consistent with Maine’s solid waste hierarchy. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide testimony. l am available to answer questions of the Committee, 
both now and at work session.
