Testimony in Support of LD 425
An Act to Lower the Environmental Impact of Consumers, Increase Food Safety and Strengthen
Consumer Choice by Ending the Ban on Single-use Plastic Shopping Bags  
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee on Environment 
and Natural Resources:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am writing this testimony in support of LD 425, “An Act to 
Lower the Environmental Impact of Consumers, Increase Food Safety and Strengthen Consumer 
Choice by Ending the Ban on Single-use Plastic Shopping Bags.”
Over the years, seeing trash on the side of the road has not been uncommon for me. Whether 
it’s volunteering with my coworkers to clean the nearby roadsides or walking down my quiet road 
when warmer weather comes and picking up trash, litter is an ever-present issue. Yet plastic shopping 
bags seem to bear extra scrutiny and a poor reputation that doesn’t take into account their 
usefulness.
From when I was young up to today, all around me I’ve seen those plastic bags reused and 
given new purpose after their “single-use”: from organizing miscellanea, to carrying clothes as a 
makeshift backpack, to lining small trash bins, and even resting on the floor board of a truck to collect 
trash that could otherwise become roadside litter. Those little bags have a myriad of handy uses, many
of which are important for reducing litter.
When I glance at my diminishing stockpile of handy plastic bags, I worry that I might run out. 
Perhaps that’s not the end of the world, but another concern is how unsanitary reusable shopping 
bags may be. I would like the option available to use single-use plastic bags, and having a receptacle at
the store in which to put used bags assures me that the means for preventing the bags from becoming
litter is provided. I think it is time for the restriction to be lifted, and I ask the Committee to vote Ought
to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
