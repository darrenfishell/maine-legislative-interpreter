LD 425
Hello, I would like to register my opposition to LD 425 that attempts to end the ban 
on single use plastic bags. Citizens have spoken and embraced this small way to help 
curb trash. Many people have been now gladly using their own grocery bags, this bill 
is a jab at environmentally minded folks and has no purpose now. It does not 
“strengthen consumer choice.” Citizens have also embraced sorting their recyclables 
(and I hope we get back to that solution in a serious way at some point), composting, 
using less harmful products at home and in the garden. Shopping bags are wasteful if 
only to end up in the landfill, or trees as litter. We’ve all seen that. Please do not relax
this ban, instead feel proud that Mainers have taken steps to be conscientious about 
our environment. Why would we go backwards? Thank you.
