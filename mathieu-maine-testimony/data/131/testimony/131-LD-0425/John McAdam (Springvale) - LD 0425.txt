I just came back from a weekend on Cape Cod MA. Travel to and from was on the 
major highways. On numerous trees along the highways there were single use plastic 
bags caught in the trees. Is this something we want to see along our highways?
We also spent a week in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. The grocery stores stopped 
bagging groceries. You bring a bag with you or take the items to your car in the cart. 
In years past locals bagged the groceries for you for a few pesos tip.
