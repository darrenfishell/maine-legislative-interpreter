Honorable Committee Members :
OPPOSED
Do you know that 91% of all plastics are not recycled ?  This includes the plastics you
have so carefully set aside and taken to your recycling centers.   National Geographic 
has reported this sad news, along with a recent program aired on Maine Public Radio. 
We have been scammed by the plastic making companies and those that support 
them; but good. It is up to us to stay aware and informed.
"An Act to Lower the Environmental Impact of Consumers"   Since both paper and 
cotton bags are renewable resources, natural and nicely biodegradable...the title and 
logic of this bill, completely eludes me.
I encourage you to vote no for the sake of our beautiful state, the future of our 
children and for the world in general. 
Thank you.
