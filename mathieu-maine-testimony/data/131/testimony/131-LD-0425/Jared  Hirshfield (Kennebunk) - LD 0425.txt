LD 425
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, 
I'm writing today in support of LD 425: "An Act to Lower the Environmental Impact 
of Consumers, Increase Food Safety and Strengthen Consumer Choice by Ending the 
Ban on Single-use Plastic Shopping Bags. 
Before the enactment of Maine's ban on single-use plastic shopping bags, I would use 
plastic shopping bags to both line small household garbage containers and pick up 
dog waste. With the enactment of Maine's ban on single use shopping bags, I now 
have to buy garbage can liners and dog  waste bags. Rather than getting multiple uses 
out of a single plastic bag, I now buy other single use plastics. 
LD 425 would grant Mainers the choice of re-using plastic shopping bags rather than 
being forced purchase other single use plastics. 
Thank you for your consideration,
Jared H. Hirshfield
