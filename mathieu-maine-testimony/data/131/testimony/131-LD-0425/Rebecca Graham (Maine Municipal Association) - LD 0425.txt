Sen. Brenner, Rep. Gramlich and distinguished members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham and I submitting testimony in opposition to LD 425, 
An Act to Lower the Environmental Impact of Consumers, Increase Food Safety and Strengthen 
Consumer Choice by Ending the Ban on Single-use Plastic Shopping Bags, and LD 572, An Act to 
Remove the 5 Cent Fee for Bags in Retail Stores on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association, which 
represents the interests of municipal government before the Legislature. The positions of the Association 
are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC), who are elected by the councils 
and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maineâ€™s 35 Senate districts.
Municipalities across Maine enacted plastic bag bans and charges as ordinances in their 
communities to deal with the overwhelming amount of waste handling that solid waste providers must 
manage but cannot control. Each community adopted these ordinances in consultation with and at the 
direction of their residents who demanded the bans. This municipal-by-municipal ordinance adoption and 
enforcement processes became unwieldy for retail providers who had multiple locations and multiple 
different ordinances to comply with. The state-wide preemption created a predictable market for the 
merchant and behavioral expectation from the general public. 
While some retail outlets use their 5 cent fee to offer bagging products that are thicker and more 
reusable, and thus even more recyclable, others chose to pocket the change and provide only paper bags 
for consumers who forget their reusable bags. Both encourage behavioral change that keeps waste out of 
the municipal solid waste stream that has a cost on the local community far outstripping the savings in the 
fiscal note added to LD 425. Officials ask that you balance small fiscal savings the Department of 
Environmental Protection may receive from LD 425, with the significant unfunded mandate such change 
will place on communities who inevitably must deal with the plastic waste that does not make it back into 
a bin outside the store. The committee may want to consider a similar 5 cent packaging waste cost for any 
plastic bag produced under LD 425, that must be removed from the municipal solid waste stream when 
placed there or on the side of the road inappropriately by a lax consumer. 
LD 572 is contrary to the will of the residents in the great number of communities that enacted 
the ban on plastic bags through their local ordinance process with desire to move this waste management 
task out of their property tax funded solid waste stream. Should the committee wish to pursue LD 572, 
officials ask that you restore the ordinance authority preempted by the state-wide ban and allow residents 
to control the cost of such waste in their own communities and by their own processes.
