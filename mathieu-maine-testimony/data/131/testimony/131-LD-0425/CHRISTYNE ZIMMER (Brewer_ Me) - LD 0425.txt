A 5 cent fee per plastic bag is NOT an economic burden as most everyone has become 
accustomed to providing their own reusable bags. It has taken awhile to arrive at this 
adjustment in our habits and we would do well to leave it in place. For those persons who 
may forget to bring bags and find 5 cents burdensome, stores should provide a recycled bag 
bin for their use.  All proceeds from the sale of plastic bags should be put in a fund for land, 
air and soil remediation which will be required sooner rather than later, if we don't stop adding
them to our waste stream.
Plastic recycling per current methods is incompatible with human health.
