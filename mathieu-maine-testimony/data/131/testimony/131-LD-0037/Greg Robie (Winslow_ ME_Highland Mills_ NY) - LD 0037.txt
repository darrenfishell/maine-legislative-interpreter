Greg C. Robie95 Mineral Springs RdHighland Mills, NY  10930March 16 & 31, 2023Taxation Committee2-3 State House Station Augusta, Maine 04333 Maine State Legislature, Joint Committee on TaxationTECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO CONSIDERRe: A generic concern for the current law, 36 MRS §6281, and the bills under consideration by the Committee to variously amend or repeal and replace “Stabilization of property taxes on homesteads of individuals 65 years of age or older,” inclusive of  LDs 37,  89, 130, 149, and 529.Chairpersons Grohoski and Perry, and Honorable Members of the Joint Committee on Taxation: Thank you for this opportunity to place my oral testimony before the Joint Committee on March 16, 2023 into a written form. The current Statue, 36 MRS §6281, which is the subject of various amendments and even repeal and replacement, has underlying language that is not sufficiently specific in terms of record titleholder of real property and Property and Land Use law (Title 33; 30-A., Chpt. 187) to avoid confusion relative to the intent of 36 MRS §6281 as Taxation law (Title 36).Taxation law variously uses the terms “record owner,” “record holder,” “record titleholder,” “title in real property,” “titleholder,” “parcel of land,” “real property,” “property,” “land,” “lot or parcel of real estate,” and “subdivision lots” to describe what tax stabilization for seniors and their homestead would apply to regarding a recorded title in real property (36 MRS §942; 36 MRS §943; 36 MRS §176-A sub-§§ (C), (6)(E)(3); 36 MSR §4641 sub-§§ (2), (2-A), (3); 36 MRS §1074; 36 MRS §701-A). 
The term “homestead” is defined in Title 36 MRS §6281, subsection C. as:"Homestead" has the same meaning as under section 681, subsection 2. Title 36, MRS §681(2), excerpted as follows to focus on the definition’s residential vs. commercial real property differentiation, is:Homestead.  "Homestead" means any residential property… assessed as real property owned by an applicant … and occupied by the applicant as the applicant's permanent residence…. A "homestead" does not include any real property used solely for commercial purposes.  This shared definitions of “homestead” is silent relative to the various terms that Taxation law uses regarding a recorded title in real property and a homestead to differentiate a “lot or parcel” from the Taxation law concept of “tax lot”. The Homestead Exemption law can be limited to apply to a tax lot. If so, no overall denial of the legislative intent of benefits for homesteads that are variously contiguous land but is assigned more than one tax lot. (Examples of this would be a record titleholder of title in real property that does not qualify under 36 MRS §701-A(¶ 2 – PL 1993, c. 317, §1), and/or has been, upon application, denied treatment as a single parcel by an assessor. With the new laws of 2019 and 2021 concerning Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU), what has been a functional ADU – accessory to a primary residence – but assessed otherwise, as well as any land associated with such an ADU, could be denied stabilization due to an assigned tax lot status. Concerning best practices, such tax lots should be exceptional due to the challenges of effecting a tax lien on a tax lot that has no title in record. An assessor should not be supported by ambiguities to divide the title of real property for which there is not a corresponding recorded deed that has been so recorded by a record titleholder. To redress this concern the following wording is offered for the Committee consideration regarding Title 36 MRS §6281(B)(2):
Is a permanent resident of the State as defined in section 681, subsection 4 who has been a record titleholder of a homestead in the State for at least 10 years.Also the amended wording for Title 36 MRS §6281(C):"Homestead" means a record title of real property that is:(1) Contiguous land, and (2) Whether divided by road, powerline or right-of-way or not, and (3) That is not held as subdivision lots, has the same meaning as under section 681, subsection 2.Even if 36 MRS § 6281 is repealed, please considering enacting the above amendments prior to repeal. This will be a significant step toward clarifying the intent of the various terms used differently for common purposes and meanings in Title 36, Title 33, and Title 30-A., Chapt. 187.)Thank you for your time and consideration. If helpful, I am a happy to answer any questions that either my oral and/or this written testimony may engender.(845) 534-7291robie@hvc.rr.comor at the above address.=)Greg
