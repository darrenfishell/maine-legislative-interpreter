LD 1970
Sen Carney, Rep Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee:
Re: LD 1970  To enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act to establish procedures 
and standards for cases concerning custody proceedings, foster care placements, 
termination of parental rights and adoptions involving Indian children. 
As I hope we are all aware, it is critically important at this  time that Maine stand 
unequivocally in support of the wisdom of ICWA by enshrining it in state law, so that
the fundamental rights of Native children continue to be respected and their welfare 
(cultural and psychological no less than material) be given the highest priority.
Please give your full support for LD 1970's passage, and thank you!
