Testimony in Support of LD 1970, “An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act ” 
 
May 30, 2023  
 
Dear  Senator Carney , Representative Moonen , and members of the J udiciary Committee,  
 
My name is James Myall. I’m  an Economic Policy Analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy, and I 
am writing on behalf of MECEP  in support of LD 1970 , An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare 
Act.  
 
Removal of In digenous children from their families and cultural tie s perpetuates  a strategy to diminish 
and extinguish  Indigenous people , language , and culture within the United States and beyond . 
Separation of Native children , which included residen tial schools designed to “kill the Indian …and save 
the man ” continued  for more than 100 years, and evolved to include  unnecessary adoption s and foster 
placement s, impact ing the Houlton Band of Maliseet  Indians , Passamaquoddy  Tribe, Penobscot Nation, 
and Mi’kmaq Nation in deeply harmful ways.  
 
Before the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act, as many as 35% of all Indigenous children within the 
Unit ed States were removed from their homes by state child welfare and private adoption agencies . 
Most of those children were placed outside of their families and communities, even when fit and willing 
relatives were avai lablei. In Maine, the rates of removal were the second highest in the nation . In 1972, 
Wabanaki children in Aroostook County were separated at rates 62 times high er tha n non -native Maine 
children .ii 
 
The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted in 1978 to “protect the best interests of Indian children and to 
promote the stability and securit y of Indian tribes and families .” The law, now considered the “gold 
standard ” of child welfare policy by leading  child advocacy organi zations , affirmed tribes ’ rights in 
matters of their youngest citizens . While implementation is far from perfect, t he law is still critically 
important . Today, in comparison to non -Native children, Indigenous children are still four times more 
likely to be removed from their families by child welfare agencies  and have 14 times higher rates in 
foster care . 56% of Native children are adopted outside of their families and comm unities .iii Between 
2000 and 2013, Wabanaki children in Maine entered foster care at more than 5 times higher rates than 
non-Native chi ldren on average .iv  
 
ICWA ’s constitutionality is being challenged in Brakeen vs. Haaland , currently pending in the U.S. 
Supreme Court  with a decision expected within weeks .v LD 1970 would codify ICWA ’s protections on the 
state level should the federal law be struck down. 12 other states have already t aken similar defensive 
action . Maine i s one of 26 states that filed amicus  briefs supporting ICWA ’s constitutionalityvi, along wi th 
the brief signed by Senator Collins, Senator King, Represen tative Pingree , and 84 other members of 
Congress .vii

LD 1970 is a critical backstop t o ensure that Wabanaki nations can continue to protect their  youngest 
citizens and their communit y cohesion  for future generations . The legislation is supported by all 
Wabanaki tribes in Maine  as well as a coal ition of more than 90 Maine organizations  representing tens 
of thousands  of Mainers . Together we  understand that strengthe ning tri bal sovereignty and self-
governance,  protecting children and families, and  honoring Wabanaki culture benefit all who live in 
Maine.  
 
I urge you  to vote “ought to pass” on the legislation. As always, if you have any questions, I can be 
reached at jmyall@mecep.org . Thank you for your consideration.
