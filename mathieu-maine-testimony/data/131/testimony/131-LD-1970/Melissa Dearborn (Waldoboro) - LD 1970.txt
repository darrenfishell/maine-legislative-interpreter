LD 1970
The US Governmentâ€™s treatment of Native American children has been horrific. LD 
1970 is an opportunity to make some amends and guarantee protection of the best 
interests of Wabanaki and other Native American children in our state. According to 
the Maine Wabanaki State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 
tribal children have been taken from their families and placed in child care at an 
alarming rate.  We know the ICWA is excellent child welfare policy with 500 tribes, 
hundreds of supporters, and at least 87 members of Congress in support.  You can be 
part of codifying ICWA protections in the state of Maine. If the Supreme Court 
weakens these provisions in June, we will rest assured Wabanaki children and 
families will still be entitled to protection with your support . Vote Ought to Pass, LD
