LD 1970
My name is Marilyn Roper.  I am a non-indigenous person who lives in Houlton on 
traditional territory of the Houlton Band of Maliseets. 
          I urge you to pass LD 1970 right away.  Why?  So that Maine will join 12 other
states in codifying Indian Child Welfare protections at  the state level.
        Why the rush?  Because the national Indian Child Welfare Act (IQUA) of 1978 
is being challenged with a pending US Supreme Court decision due in June.  
Members of this Supreme Court show no shame in overturning US law on the books 
for decades.  
          Let's be sure to protect Wabanaki children in Maine no matter what the US 
Supreme Court decides.  Thanks.
