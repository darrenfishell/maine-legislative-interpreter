LD 1970
Dear Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to support LD 1970.
ICWA was made to protect Native children. It was established because churches and 
our government thought it was okay to take Native children from the great care of 
their Native families and send them off to boarding schools across the US in attempts 
to "civilize" them. These schools used many forms of dehumanizing abuse on these 
children, that took some of their lives. These graves made the front pages during the 
pandemic. This Boarding school program eventually turned into foster care 
malpractice that took advantage of Native families well into the 21st century. This 
affects me - because I cannot live in a world where children are endangered. We can 
fix this. Maine has the chance to enact ICWA, which has been labeled the “gold 
standard” in child welfare policy and practice by a coalition of 18 national child 
advocacy organizations. Native children are children and Maine could codify the gold
standard of protection that 12 other states have already done to protect their youth.  
This is why I ask you to support LD 1970. We need to protect our future, and that 
starts with protecting every child in our state. 
Thank you for your time.
