LD 1970
My name is Rebecca Scarborough from Camden, and I am writing in support of LD 
1970 - An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act.
In Maine, according to a 2015 report of the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare 
Truth & Reconciliation Commission, Wabanaki children were placed in foster care in 
similarly higher rates than non-Native children prior to ICWA’s enactment in 1978. 
For Aroostook County in 1972, the rate of removal for Wabanaki children was 62.4 
times higher than the statewide rate for non-Native children. The rates for Maine were
the second highest in the nation at that time. (Source: Maine Wabanaki-State Child 
Welfare Truth & Reconciliation Commission report, page 21)
Even after ICWA’s enactment, a disproportionately higher rate of Wabanaki children 
in Maine are taken into foster care than non-Native children. (Source: Maine 
Wabanaki- State Child Welfare Truth & Reconciliation Commission report, page 21)
ICWA serves the best interests of Wabanaki and other Native American children by 
keeping them connected to their culture, extended family and community, which are 
proven protective factors. (Source: “The Indian Child Welfare Act Fact Sheet” 
prepared by the National Indian Child Welfare Association).
Nearly 500 tribes, hundreds of supporters, and at least 87 members of Congress 
support ICWA as the abiding standard in Native child welfare. Source: Partnership 
With Native Americans).
I support this important bill, and I hope you will too.
Thank you.
