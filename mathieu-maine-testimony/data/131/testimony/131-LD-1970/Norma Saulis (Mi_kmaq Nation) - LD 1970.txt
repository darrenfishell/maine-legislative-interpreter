Testimony of Norma Saulis, ICWA Director for the M|'kmaq Nation 
Wohspasaway from the People of the M|'kmaq Nationl I am Norma Saulis, ICWA Director for the 
M|'kmaq Nation and I am honored to present testimony today in support of LD1970, SP0804 An Act to 
Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act 
I wish to thank the Chair, the Sponsor Donna Bailey of York, as well all the members on the Committee 
on Judiciary for this opportunity to present testimony in support of this Bill 
It is important to me that l share with this committee how our ICWA Department functions on a regular 
basis A brief overview would be that we focus primarily on placement preference of our M|'kmaq 
children and ensure that "active efforts" are being done through DHHS OCFS (Department of Health& 
Human Services Office of Children Services) to reunify children with their parents We co-case manage 
with caseworkers & supervisors from the OCFS in reports/investigations, ongoing permanency cases, 
child protection hearings, home studies, home visits, Family Team Meetings, and case reviews in family 
court Tribal ICWA staff collaborate with OCFS caseworkers for plans of care that focus on, ensuring 
children's safety, minimizing disruption, promoting ‚Äùactive efforts" for services to the parent/s toward 
reunification, identifying permanent placement options, continuing to provide contact with extended 
family and tribal members of the children, advocating for cultural connections and resources 
As you know, ICWA IS a federal law passed in 1978 that governs the removal and placement of Native 
children The law was enacted by the federal government because it was recognized that Native children 
were being removed from their families and communities at a much higher rate than non-Native 
children ICWA protects the best interests of Native children, by keeping them connected to their 
families and having access to their culture 
ICWA laws are important because it has safeguards that recognize a parent's constitutional right to care 
for their child and the child's right to family integrity Provisions emphasize with the courts that placing 
Native children with Native family members and maintaining cultural connection is in the child's best 
interest The language recognizes that children are "vital to the continued existence and integrity of 
Indian tribes and that the United States has a direct interest in protecting Indian children " The ICWA 
laws have become the "gold standard" in child welfare In reduicing children's trauma of being removed 
from parents by promoting placement with family and within their community and maintaining a 
cultural connection
I 
The Federal ICWA laws have been under attack in the case of Brackeen v Haaland that sits before the 
Supreme Court now It presents the argument that ICWA is unconstitutional because it racially 
discriminates against white adoptive families The outcome of the case could have far-reaching 
implications for the welfare of Native children, their families, and for tribal sovereignty 
Given this federal threat to ICWA protections, Maine has an important opportunity right now to put 
what is already best practice child welfare in this state into Statute This will ensure ICWA protections 
are in place for Native children living in Maine, no matter the outcome of the Brackeen case
