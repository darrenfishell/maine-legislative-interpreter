Honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, 
I am writing to express my support for LD 1970: An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act. 
Critically, passing this bill into Maine law would codify the protections afforded by the Federal Indian 
Child Welfare Act (ICWA) at the state level, a measure that twelve other states have already taken, and 
many others are actively pursuing. Known as the “gold standard” in child welfare policy, ICWA protects 
Wabanaki and other Native children by keeping them connected to their families, communities, and 
culture. Since the future of ICWA is uncertain at the federal level due to misinterpretations of this 
proven-effective policy, now is the time to act to make sure that Maine does what is best for Native 
children and Wabanaki communities.  
We are lucky here in Maine to be able to learn from the groundbreaking work of the Maine Wabanaki 
Child Welfare Truth & Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which came about a decade ago in response to 
the disproportionate removal of Wabanaki children from their communities and the extraordinary 
harms those removals entailed. The testimony  the TRC collected and the report  they issued offer ample 
evidence that ICWA must be safeguarded and enforced. Writing its mandates into Maine statute is the 
best way to do that right now.  
Like its federal counterpart, the Maine ICWA offers a roadmap that involves notifying and engaging the 
Tribe, providing active efforts to prevent removal and facilitate reunification, following ICWA placement 
preferences (while also considering the preferences of the child and parent), and retaining the 
testimony of an ICWA Qualified Expert Witness. Please act now to ensure that Maine does not lose this 
essential roadmap toward the safety, wellbeing, and health of Wabanaki children and tribal nations; 
support the passage of LD 1970.  
Sincerely, 
Erika Arthur 
Freedom, ME
