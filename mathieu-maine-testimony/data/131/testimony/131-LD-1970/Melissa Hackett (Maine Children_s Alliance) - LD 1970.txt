May 315‘ , 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and esteemed members of the Judiciary Committee 
My name is Melissa Hackett I am a policy associate with the Maine Children's Alliance, a 
nonproﬁt, statewide public policy organization l also serve as the coordinator for the Maine 
Child Welfare Action Network, a group of organizations and individuals in Maine working 
together to align, strengthen, and sustain efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of all 
Maine families l am here today to testify in strong support of LD 1970 
As background, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) IS a federal law passed in 1978 that governs 
the removal and placement of Native children The law was enacted after the federal 
government recognized that Native children were being removed from their families and 
communities at a much higher rate than non-Native children ICWA protects the best interests 
of Native children, by keeping them connected to their families and tribes 
This law is important, because it has safeguards that recognize a parent's constitutional right to 
care for their child and the child's right to family integrity Provisions emphasize with the courts 
that placing Native children with Native family members and maintaining cultural connection IS 
in the child's best interest The language recognizes that children are ”vital to the continued 
existence and integrity of Indian tribes and that the United States has a direct interest in 
protecting Indian children " In essence, the law protects the best interests of Native children, 
and it aligns with child welfare best practice 
ICWA reﬂects best practice in child welfare, as it seeks to reduce children's trauma of being 
removed from parents by promoting placement with family and within their community 
Research shows keeping children connected to family, culture, and community are important 
protective factors that promote child well-being by acting as a buffer to adverse experiences 
Yet we are at a moment in time when ICWA IS under threat The case of Brackeen v Haaland sits 
before the Supreme Court, arguing that ICWA IS unconstitutional because it racially 
discriminates against white adoptive families The outcome of the case could have far-reaching 
implications for the welfare of Native children, their families, and their communities 
Given the federal threat to ICWA protections, Maine has an important opportunity right now to 
put what is already best practice child welfare in the state into statute This will ensure ICWA 
protections are in place for Native children living in Maine, no matter the outcome of the 
Brackeen case These protections are essential to ensure Native children have the opportunity 
to grow up connected to family, their communities, and their cultural heritage Thank you
