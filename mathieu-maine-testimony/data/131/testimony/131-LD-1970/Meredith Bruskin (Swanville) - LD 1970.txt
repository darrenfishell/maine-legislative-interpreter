Meredith Bruskin
Swanville
LD 1970
Dear Judiciary Committee Members: My name is Meredith Bruskin, I am a Nurse 
Practitioner and I live in Swanville. I believe that there may be no more important bill
before you this session than LD 1970. I implore you to support this Bill--just as 
Senators Collins and King, and Representative Pingree understand the importance of 
protecting Native children from further abuse by being removed from their culture , 
extended families and community as has happened excessively in the past, by joining 
the Amicus Brief in support of ICWA before the Supreme Court, we must ensure that 
ICWA is reenforced in our State Legisature as well. I do not have to tell you of the 
damage done by removal of 25-35% of children from Wabanaki Tribes historically as 
documented in 1978. We have far to go in answering the Wabanaki Truth and 
Reconciliation discoveries and the harm done our Maine First Peoples. Please follow 
your hearts and all the studies that clearly show ICWA at least helps these children 
and communities repair. Please support LD 1970--it is the right thing to do. Thank 
you for  listening.
