LD 1970
My name is Katherine Rhoda. I reside in Hiram. Iâ€™m writing in support of LD 1970.
The work of the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth & Reconciliation 
Commission, which released its report in 2015, makes a compelling case for the 
human value of the policies embodied the federal Indian Child Welfare Act. 
Regardless of whether or not ICWA continues at the federal level, pending Supreme 
Court action, Maine has the opportunity to do the right thing by codifying its 
protections into state law, as 12 other states have already done. Please do your part to 
see that through.
Thank you for your time, your attention, and your public service!
