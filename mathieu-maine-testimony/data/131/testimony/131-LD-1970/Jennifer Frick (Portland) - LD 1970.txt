With so much research supporting the benefits of ICWA to Wabanaki children as well
as reports certifying the overrepresentation of Wabanaki children taken from their 
homes compared to non-Native children who are put in foster care, it is crucial that 
ICWA be codified at the state level. ICWA serves the best interests of Wabanaki and 
other Native American children by keeping them connected to their culture, extended 
family and community, which are proven protective factors. Source: “The Indian 
Child Welfare Act Fact Sheet” prepared by the National Indian Child Welfare 
Association). 
I grew up in a white family of European descent, in a city divided into “sections” of 
Europe, as well as an African-American section. As school children whenever we met
a child new to us we would ask “what are you?” meaning, are you German, Polish, 
French, Irish, etc? Even though most of us were a mixture, we were “proud” of 
whatever heritages they were. “Belonging”- even though for us it was more just the 
idea of belonging to an ethnic group- was a crucial part of our identities.
 To be taken from one’s established culture, language, and ethic identity and be 
placed in a culture so radically different from one’s own would have been 
devastating. Belonging is a vital part of being a healthy, functional human being. 
ICWA was designed to protect Indian children from the effects of being completely 
separated from their community of origin. Please codify ICWA for the state of Maine 
to protect the rights of Wabanaki children.
Thank you for your deep consideration of this matter.
