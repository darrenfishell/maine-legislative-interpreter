LD 1970
As a citizen of Maine concerned with remediating our state's historic treatment of the 
Wabanaki, I write in support of LD 1970. The 1978 federal Child Welfare Act was 
passed to prioritize keeping Indian children in their native culture and extended 
families rather than removing them to the custody of non-native families. This is 
important for the welfare of native children. As the federal law is under constitutional 
attack it is critical that states enact this protection as a matter of state law. Our 
legislators in Congress and our state have filed a brief in support of the federal act.  
Passing  LD 1970, the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act, will guarantee that Wabanaki
children will continue to receive the protections contained in the federal act. I urge the
Committee and the legislature to support and pass LD 1970
