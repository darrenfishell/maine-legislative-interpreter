LD 1970
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Naneen Chace-Ortiz, and I am one of your constituents. I live in 
Westbrook, Maine and Iâ€™m writing in support of LD 1970.
As a Unitarian Universalist, I believe in the inherent worth and dignity of every 
human being and in justice, equity and compassion in human relations. I am writing 
in support of LD 1970 An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act. LD 1970
codifies the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a federal Indian law, on state level for 
Maine. Passing this bill will be absolutely critical if the Supreme Court strikes down 
the Indian Child Welfare Act this summer. I ask that you vote to pass LD 1970.
I support LD 1970 for the following reasons ICWA serves the best interests of 
Wabanaki and other Native American children by keeping them connected to their 
culture, extended family and community, which are proven protective factors.
Again, I urge you to give LD 1970 your full support and to talk to your legislative 
colleagues to encourage their support as well. Thank you.
Yours truly,
Naneen
