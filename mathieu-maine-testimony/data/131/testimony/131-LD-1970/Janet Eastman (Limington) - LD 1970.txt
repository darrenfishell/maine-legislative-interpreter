LD 1970
To the Chair and Members of the Judiciary Committee, I respectfully submit my 
testimony  in support of LD 1970 - ICWA.
 I believe it is an easy and simple act  to assure the Wabanaki people in Maine that we
honor them and their families.  We value our culture and our families and we value 
Wabanaki culture and families as well. We must support and ensure that Native 
families are fully protected under the law to keep their families and their culture intact
and whole.
By enacting LD 1970, Maine would join 12 other states that have acted to codify 
ICWA protections on the state level. By doing so we would insure that Wabanaki 
peoples' families and culture are protected. 
Why would we not do this?
Please vote to pass LD1970.
