LD 1970
I am writing today in support of LD1970. With this act Maine would join 12 other 
states that have acted to codify ICWA protection on the state level. This would protect
Wabanaki children, families, culture and sovereignty if the U.S. Supreme Court in 
June decides to weaken or destroy protections which have been known to be the "gold
standard" of child welfare policies for 40 years.
ICWA helps Wabanaki children to stay connected to their culture, extended family 
and community. 
I am recently retired and over a 40-year career in human services I have seen the 
impact on the Wabanaki that were removed from their home and the difficult and 
arduous journey to try and re-establish connection with their community. 
It is vitally important for the Tribes of Maine to pass LD 1970, so that the Supreme 
Court cannot put Maine backwards and that children can be raised by their families 
and communities without fear of removal which has had a detrimental and devastating
impact on individuals, families and community of the Tribes of Maine.
I support LD 1970 as it is the only ethical choice.
