Senator Bailey, Representative Dana, and Honorable Members of the Maine Judiciary
Committee:
As the Co-Chair of the Maine Wabanaki State Child Welfare Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission(TRC), 2013-2015, I strongly support passage of LD 
1970, an Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act.  Our in-depth research and
findings highlighted the disparity in the number of native children in foster care and 
recommended stronger adherence to the Indian Child Welfare Act.  Sine that time,  I 
am pleased to note that Maine has made many of the changes recommended in the 
TRC report. 
ICWA is known to be the 'gold standard' of child welfare practice and should be 
encoded in Maine law to ensure that Wabanaki children benefit from adherence to its 
guidelines.
I encourage you to pass this Act. Thank you.
