Gouldsboro
LD 1970
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Shemaya Laurel and I live in Gouldsboro. I am writing in support of LD 
1970, An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act.
For all the evidence-based reasons that you have heard about already, this act is 
important to the well-being of Indigenous children in Maine, as well as to their 
families and communities. Staying connected with family and culture is crucial to 
well-being.
Maine must rely on having its own sturdy legislation in support of ICWA, in case 
something changes at the federal level. I hope that you will pass this bill, LD 1970, 
with your full support. It is crucial.
Sincerely,
Shemaya Laurel
