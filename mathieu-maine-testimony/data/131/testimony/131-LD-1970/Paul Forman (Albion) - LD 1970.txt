LD 1970
     My name is Paul Forman. I live in Albion and I am writing to ask for your support 
of LD 1970. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is one of the most important 
pieces of Indigenous People's legislation ever passed and it is important to preserve its
principles for the citizens of Maine.
     Prior to the passage of this Act, as many as 85%  of Indigenous children removed 
from their families were placed outside of their families and communities, even when 
fit and willing relatives were available for the child's placement.
     These children were deprived of their culture and heritage. Many were abused. The
ICWA helped to stop these practices and gave the tribes a role in the placement 
process.
     Please support LD 1970 and protect Maines Indigenous children.
                                  Thank You,  Paul Forman, Albion, Maine
