Wayne Cobb
Portland
LD 1970
To the Honorable Senator Anne Carney (chair), Honorable Representative Matt 
Moonen (chair) and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:
My name is Wayne Cobb. I live in Portland. Today I urge your Committee to vote 
unanimously OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1970.  
ICWA has been labeled the “gold standard” in child welfare policy and practice by a 
coalition of 18 national child advocacy organizations. ICWA serves the best interests 
of Wabanaki and other Native American children by keeping them connected to their 
culture, extended family and community, which are proven protective factors.
Nearly 500 tribes, hundreds of supporters, and at least 87 members of Congress 
support ICWA as the abiding standard in Native child welfare.
Maine’s U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree are 
among the 87 members of Congress who signed the “friends of the court” brief 
supporting ICWA in the pending Brackeen vs. Haaland case that is expected to be 
decided in June.
Please help Maine join 12 other states that have acted to codify ICWA protections on 
the state level by voting OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1970. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Wayne Cobb
