LD 1970
Senator Bailey and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Mary Laughlin.  I live in Limngton.   I am writing in support of LD 1970 
- An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act.  
As I understand, this bill codifies into state law the protections guaranteed under the 
federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.  State protection is important and urgent as 
the 1978 federal law may be weakened or overturned by four cases currently before 
he U.S. Supreme Court.   
LD 1970 will preserve and strengthen Wabanaki families in Maine by preventing 
out-of-home placement whenever possible, reunify families, and establish guidelines 
to ensure that Wabanaki children have connection with and support from Wabanaki 
culture and care.
If passed, LD 1970 will allow Maine to join 12 other states that have codified the 
protections of the 1978 ICWA at the state level.  
LD 1970 has bipartisan support and I am honored to testify for its passage, also.
Please vote "ought to pass."
