Testimony in Support of LD 1970 “An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare 
Act”
May 30, 2023
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Adrienne Horne and I’m a resident of Appleton, ME. I am writing today 
in support of LD 1970 “An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act”.
The Indian Child Welfare act of 1978 (ICWA) has been labeled the “gold standard” in
child welfare policy and practice by a coalition of 18 national child advocacy 
organizations and is supported by nearly 500 tribes, hundreds of supporters, and at 
least 87 members of Congress including Maine Senators Susan Collins and Angus 
King and Representative Chellie Pingree. In Maine specifically, we know from the 
Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth & Reconciliation Commission report 
from 2015 that before ICWA the rate of removal for Wabanaki children was 62.4 
times higher than the statewide rate for non-Native children, the second highest in the 
nation at the time. Removing Indigenous children from their homes unnecessarily, 
especially when fit and willing relatives are available, is harmful. Passing LD 1970 
would bring Maine in line with 12 other states that have already acted to codify 
ICWA at the state level and protect Wabanaki children, families, culture, and 
sovereignty if the US Supreme Court decides in June to remove the “gold standard” 
of child welfare policies for the last 40 years. Please join me in supporting LD 1970 
and protecting the children and families in our state.
Thank you for considering my testimony, and thank you for all the work that you do.
Sincerely,
Adrienne Horne
Appleton, ME
