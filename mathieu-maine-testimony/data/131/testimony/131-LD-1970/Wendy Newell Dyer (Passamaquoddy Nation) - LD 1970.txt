May 31“ , 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and esteemed members of the Judiciary Committee My name 
is Wendy Newell Dyer I am testifying in support of LD 1970, An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child 
Welfare Act 
As I stood atop Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park on Earth Day in April of 1990, I felt as ifl had 
ﬁnally found my way home after a lifetime of wondering who I was and where I came from Ciﬁzens of 
the four tribal nations of Maine had gathered for a sunrise ceremony on Acad|a's highest peak It'sa 
sacred spot to the masses, but particularly to the People of the Dawn In the darkness, before ﬁrst light, 
standing there on the summit, I began to weep 
My tears were of relief and gratitude that my search to ﬁnd my biological parents had ended I was ﬁlled 
with emotion ﬁnally knowing that I was a citizen of the Passamaquoddy Nation, newly found information 
that explained so much about my personality and sense of being I had spent my ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years 
feeling different from my adopnve family, peers and neighbors I often felt like an outsider growing up, 
like I didn't belong In those moments on Cadillac prior to sunrise, as I listened to the drums and songs of 
my ancestors, I felt connected to the earth and to other human beings in a way that I had never 
experienced before 
It had been almost a year since I had called my birth father, Wayne Newell, a well-respected 
Passamaquoddy leader and forward thinker who had devoted his life trying to preserve the language of 
his ancestors and to improve the quality of life of those within the tribe Legally blind since birth, he was 
a man of vision He was known throughout the state and country for helping bridge the gap of 
understanding between the Native and non-native worlds 
When I phoned him that day, I asked if he knew my mother back in 1964 He said that he did but afterI 
asked if he might be my father, he quickly replied, ”No, oh no, it's not possible That's just not possible" 
Out of frustration and disappointment, I hung up the phone without telling him my name I had takena 
risk to call His denial pierced my heart like the sting of a wasp 
My ﬁrst reaction was to hang up but instead of giving up, I wrote a letter to him with my name and 
intentions, then asked him to search his soul When he received my letter a few days later he 
immediately called After we had previously talked, he realized that he was likely my father and had been 
frantic for several days not knowing my name or how to ﬁnd me 
We agreed to have blood work done to be certain Paternity tests conﬁrmed our shared DNA three 
months later and thus began my JOLIFIIEY to come to know myself as a Passamaquoddy woman Finding 
my birth family was a lot to process, but even more so when I found out that I was of mixed race, and 
that I had been purposely disconnected from my cultural heritage and teachings 
It was upsetting to know that racial indifference was why I was ripped from my white mother's arms, 
withheld from my Native father's knowledge and kidnapped from my tribe and culture all because of the
color of my father and my skIn I felt a great deal of negatIvIty toward my b|rth mother's father who had 
declared that he wanted nothIng to do w|th a Passamaquoddy baby He sent my b|rth mother away so 
that no one would know she was carryIng the chIld ofa man from the neIghborIng reservatIon He was 
embarrassed and dIsgusted 
The mentalIty In chIld welfare at that tIme was to adopt out as many NatIve chlldren to non-nat1ve 
famIlIes as possIble to gIve the chIldren what was perceIved as a "better" IIfe w|th more opportunItIes 
My adophon was before the IndIan ChIld Welfare Act became law Had I been born after 1978, an effort 
would have been made by chIld welfare to connect me w|th my father or to place me wIthIn the trIbe 
FIndIng my way back was the easy part, ﬁndmg acceptance for what had been stolen from me took many 
years to achIeve In the early days, the culture was foreIgn to me I d|dn't know the language, customs or 
teachIngs I had grown up w|th the whItewashed, textbook, Hollywood versIon of our country's hIstory 
ﬁlled w|th Inaccurate InformatIon, unmerIted generaIIzat1ons and stereotypes I had not been taught 
about the trIbal natIons of MaIne I d|dn't know there were three reservanons wIthIn two and a half 
hours from the Island where I was raIsed There was so much that I d|dn't know 
As the sun rose over AcadIa that day, It was the ﬁrst tIme that I heard drummmg I was mesmerIzed 
Though It was my ﬁrst experIence, It seemed as If I had always heard the drum I d|dn't know the words 
but the songs were so famI|Iar My father's voIce rose above the others that mornIng as he sang and 
prayed I was uncertaIn what I should do, so I awkwardly followed the cues ofthose gathered when we 
turned to face the four dIrect1ons as they prayed In our NatIve tongue We smudged w|th sage They 
sang, danced and drummed 
Over tIme, I learned the songs, how to drum and dance I've smudged and prayed on many occasIons I 
went Into sweat lodges, accompanIed trIbal members on memorIal canoe trIps, clImbed our sacred 
m0untaIns and took part In many dIfferent ceremonIes Each tIme I dId somethIng new It took great 
courage Many tImes I was hesItant but remInded myself that those thIngs were my bIrthrIght, soI 
stretched myself In ways I had not thought possIb|e 
For the next thIrty plus years, I accompanIed my father to sImIIar gatherIngs where he shared a part of 
hImseIf to help the world better understand NatIve People and our hIstoI'y My favorIte memory was 
when I accompanled hIm to Washmgton DC, to watch hIm perform at the LIbrary of Congress then at the 
Kennedy Center It was truly one of the best days of my IIfe, a memory that sustalns me and one thatI 
wIlI forever cherIsh 
Just before ChrIstmas In 2021, I stood over my father's hospItal bed In hIs IIvIng room on the reservat1on 
The last words that he saId to me were, "Have you met my daughter?" It was a lIne that he always used 
to Introduce me to hIs frIends and acquaIntances at the events we attended together Though we had 
been=separated for twenty-ﬁve years, we shared a specIal bond over the next thIrty-one I was humbled 
that he carrIed me In hIs heart even as he lay dyIng As he drew hIs last breath, I had a deep sense of 
gratItude that I had found hIm and my trlbe, and for the reIat1onshIp that we had shared- He touched my 
IIfe In countless ways He was a father to me In every sense of the word
Learmng the Passamaquoddy teachmgs and tradltlons has taken a great deal of effort and dedlcatlon 
Do|ng so has gnven me many profound and mov|ng expenences My greatest heartache has been thatI 
was dlsconnected from the language of my ancestors that had been passed down for thousands of years 
Though my slblmgs understand the Passamaquoddy language, I have only learned a few words and 
phrases So many of our cultural teachmgs are held w|th|n the language I cannot pass those teachlngs 
on to my offsprmg |n our Natlve tongue 
I have learned so much but st|ll have so much more to learn I marvel at the res|l|ence ofthe 
Passamaquoddy people We have somehow overcome all the attempts to wlpe us off the face of the 
earth Our cultural teachmgs, language and customs have endured one attack after another, but we have 
survnved Many, l|ke me, were taken from our culture but somehow, we found our way home We asa 
People are stlll here I am stlll here 
I urge you to support this leglslahon, and ensure every effort Wlll be made |n Mame when Natlve 
chlldren cannot be w|th the|r parents, to keep them w|th the|r fam|l|es, tr|bal commumtles, and 
connected to the|r cultural heritage Thank you
I
