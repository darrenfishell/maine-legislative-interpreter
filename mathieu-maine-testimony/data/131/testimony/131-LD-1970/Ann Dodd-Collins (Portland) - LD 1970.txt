LD 1970
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary
My name is Ann Dodd-Collins, and I live in Portland. Today I urge your Committee 
to vote unanimously OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1970, An Act to Enact the Maine 
Indian Child Welfare Act.
By enacting LD 1970, Maine would join 12 other states that have acted to codify 
ICWA protections on the state level. This would protect Wabanaki children, families, 
culture, and sovereignty if the U.S. Supreme Court decides in June to weaken or 
destroy protections that have been known as the “gold standard” of child welfare 
policies for 40 years. It would serve the best interests of Wabanaki and other Native 
American children by keeping them connected to their culture, extended family and 
community.  
In 1978, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association, nationwide 25%
to 35% of all Indigenous children were removed from their homes by state child 
welfare and private adoption agencies. As many as 85% of those children were placed
outside of their families and communities — even when fit and willing relatives were 
available.  A 2015 report of the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth & 
Reconciliation Commission, stated that Wabanaki children continued to be placed in 
foster care in similarly higher rates than non-Native children prior to ICWA’s 
enactment in 1978. This is unconscionable. As a parent, the thought of children being 
ripped from their families and their communities breaks my heart.  We must protect 
the children of the Wabanaki nations in Maine, especially since we cannot depend on 
the U.S. Supreme Court to do so.
Please support LD 1970 and vote OUGHT TO PASS.
