Sen.

Rep.
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on

my

DiMarco,
a

of
Houlton,

representing
Pax
Christi
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
of fer
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1970
An
Act
to
Enact
the
Maine
Indian
Child
W elfare
Act.
Pax
Christi
Maine
is
part
of
a
national
and
international
movement
working
for
peace,
justice
&
environmental
sustainability .
Pax
Christi,
meaning
“Peace
of
Christ”,
is
rooted
in
Gospel
nonviolence
and
Catholic
Social
T eaching,
which
includes
principles
of
human
dignity ,
care
for
God’ s
creation,
and
solidarity .
Support
of
right
relationship
with
our
W abanaki
neighbors
exemplifies
these
principles.
The
United
States
and
Maine
have
a
history
of
removing
a
disproportionately
high
number
native
children
from
not
only
their
homes,
but
from
their
extended
families
and
subsequently
from
their
cultures.
Since
1978,
the
federal
Indian
Child
W elfare
Act
has
protected
native
children
and
their
families
from
unnecessary
separation.
The
act
has,
for
the
most
part,
met
its
goals
and,
in
fact,
is
considered
the
“gold
standard”
in
child
welfare
policy
and
practice
by
18
national
child
advocacy
or ganizations.
Keeping
children
connected
with
their
families
and
their
culture
has
been
proven
to
be
a
vital
protective
factor .
This
well-proven
policy
is
in
danger
of
being
overturned
by
the
Supreme
Court
this
summer .
W e
implore
you
to
take
action
to
prevent
this
.
The
State
of
Maine
must
protect
W abanaki
children,
families,
their
culture,
and
sovereignty .
During
Maine’ s
T ruth
and
Reconciliation
Commission
hearings
in
2015,
we
heard
the
moving
testimony
of
tribal
citizens
who
as
children
were
placed
with
non-indigenous
families.
All
suf fered
enormously
due
to
separation
from
their
culture
and
their
identity
and
a
great
many
suf fered
abuse.
Since
then,
the
state
has
worked
hard
to
come
into
compliance
with
the
Indian
Child
W elfare
Act.
Sen.
King,
Sen.
Collins
and
Rep
Chellie
Pingree
were
among
87
members
of
Congress
who
showed
support
for
ICW A.
Maine
child
welfare
workers
also
support
implementation
of
the
law .
Pax
Christi
Maine
fully
supports
LD
1970
which
would
codify
ICW A
into
Maine
law
so
that
this
important
work
can
continue.
The
shameful
history
of
Christian
churches’
participation
in
the
removal
of
native
children
from
their
families
and
into
boarding
schools,
foster
care
and
adoption
makes
it
imperative
that
Pax
Christi
Maine
speaks
out
for
substantive
change
in
policy!
Please
vote
LD
1970,
An
Act
to
Enact
the
Maine
Indian
Child
W elfare
Act
ought
to
pass.
