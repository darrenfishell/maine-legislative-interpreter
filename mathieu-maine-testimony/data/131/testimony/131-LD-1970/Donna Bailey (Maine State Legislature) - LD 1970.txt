Testimony of Senator Donna Bailey introducing 
LD 197 0, An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 31, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen, and colleagues of the Judrclary Comm1ttee, as you 
know, my name 1s Donna Barley, and I proudly represent Senate D1str1ct 31, whlch 1ncludes 
Buxton, Old Orchard Beach, and Saco Today, I am pleased to rntroduce LD 1970, “An Act to 
Enact the Ma1ne Ind1an Chlld Welfare Act” 
To start, I want to share some hlstory and background about the Federal Ind1an Chlld Welfare 
Act (ICWA), whrch th1s b1ll 1s modeled after The U S Congress enacted ICWA 1n 1978 to 
address the agency pohcres and pract1ces that resulted 1n the wholesale separatlon of Ind1an 
chrldren from thelr famlhes State and prlvate agenc1es were removlng as many as 25% to 35% 
of Ind1an Cl’11lClI'6Il from the1r fam1l1es and placlng many of these chlldren 1n non-Ind1an foster 
and adoptlve homes Congress determmed that cultural 1gnorance and blases w1th1n the ch1ld 
welfare system were slgnlﬁcant causes of th1s problem In hght of th1s, Congress recognlzed that 
1t1s 1n the best mterest of a ch1ld to ma1nta1n Trlbal connectlons and that chlldren are vltal to 
Trlbes’ contlnued exlstence That’s why ICWA arms to “protect the best mterests of Ind1an 
chlldren and promote the stab1l1ty and securrty of Ind1an Trrbes and famlhes ”1 
The Federal ICWA governs State ch1ld-custody proceedrngs 1n multlple ways 
0 Recognlzes Tr1bal ]ur1sd1ct1on over dec1s1ons for thelr Ind1an chrldren, 
0 Estabhshes m1n1mum Federal standards for the removal of Ind1an chrldren from the1r 
fam1l1es, 
0 Establlshes preferences for placement of Ind1an ch1ldren wlth extended famrly or other 
Tr1ba1 famrhes, 
0 Instltutes protectlons to ensure that brrth parents’ voluntary rellnqulshments of therr 
chrldren are truly voluntary 
In Mame, we have our own hlstory Wrth ICWA In 1999, the Mame Ofﬁce of Ch1ld and Famlly 
Servlces (OCFS) and tr1bal ch1ld welfare staff formed the ICWA Workgroup to address the

1ssues of state non-compl1ance w1th ICWA The Workgroup sought to 1mprove the hlstory of 
mlstrust and the lack of effectlve worklng relat1onsh1ps After a decade of work, OCFS 
conducted a case rev1ew 1n 2009 The rev1ew found that, desplte progress, some state ch1ld 
welfare workers needed to lmprove the1r engagement w1th the tnbal ch1ld welfare workers and 
functlon as co-case managers It “determmed that the story of the Wabanakl people’s experlences 
w1th state ch1ld welfare needed to be unearthed 1n order to fully uphold the sp1r1t, letter, and 
lntent of ICWA 1n a way that promoted healmg ”2 By 2010, the Workgroup declded to createa 
Truth and Reconc1l1at1on Commlsslon (TRC) The Comm1ss1on ’s Declaratlon of Intent outlmed 
three goals 
1 To create a common understandmg between the Wabanakl and the State of Mame 
concernmg what happened and 1s happenlng to Wabanak1 chrldren 1n the ch1ld welfare 
system, 
2 To act on 1nformat1on revealed durlng the TRC to 1mprove the ch1ld welfare system and 
to better support the chrldren and fam1l1es served, 
3 To promote healmg, both among Wabanakl chrldren and the1r fam1l1es and the people 
who admmlstered a wldely acknowledged less-than-ldeal system 
Among the recommendatlons from the TRC, some focused speclﬁcally on ICWA 
0 W1th the counsel of the trlbes, develop a p0l1cy to monltor regular compllance wlth 
ICWA, the selectlon of ICWA l1a1sons, and the eventual prov1s1on of a superv1s0ry-level 
staff member responslble for ICWA 1n each DHHS dlstrlct ofﬁce 
0 Fund the renewal of the ICWA Workgroup and 1nvolve them 1n deslgmng and 
lmplementmg tra1n1ng so that all levels of leadershlp are mvolved3 
To my understandmg, the State and the ICWA Workgroup have contmued to make progress and 
work collaboratlvely to lmprove the State’s compl1ance wlth the sp1r1t, letter and lntent of 
ICWA I have heard from many mvolved 1n the system that ICWA has worked well 1n the State, 
and that outcomes for Indlan chlldren have lmproved over the years I am not saymg everythlng 
1s perfect, but 1t 1s better than 1t was, and cont1nu1ng to progress 1n the r1 ght d1rect1on 
Unfortunately, at the Federal level, there have been numerous court challenges to ICWA, the 
latest wave beg1nn1ng most recently 1n 2013 and culmmatlng 1n a case currently pendlng before 
the US Supreme Court (Haaland v Brackeen, docket number 21-376) that may be ruled on soon 
In response to these challenges, several states have, over the years, adopted thelr own verslons of 
ICWA 4 
These states lnclude Iowa, Mlchlgan, Mmnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and 
Washmgton Wlth LD 1970, Mame w1ll _]O1I1 these other states to contlnue to promote the safety, 
permanence, and well-bemg of Indlan chlldren, no matter what dec1s1ons may be made at the 
Federal level
