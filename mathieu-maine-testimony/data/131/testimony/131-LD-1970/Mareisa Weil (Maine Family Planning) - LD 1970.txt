Maine Family Planning  
Testimony in Support  of 
LD 1970 , An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child Welfare Act  
June 6, 2023  
   Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable  members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary , my name is Mareisa Weil, and I a m the Vice Pre sident for Development & Community Engagement a t 
Maine Family Planning , and we are writing today in support of LD 1 970, An Act to Enact the Maine Indian Child 
Welfare Act.  
  The ICWA, enacted in 1978, was a significant step towards rectifying the historic and ongoing injustices 
inflicted upon Native American communities. It was designed to address the disproportionate removal of Native American children from their families and tribes,  resulting in cultural erosion and profound psychological impacts. 
The Act recognized the inherent sovereignty of tribes and the unique political and cultural relationship between the 
United States government and Native American tribes.  
 
 The federal Indian Child Welfare Act has played a pivotal role in recognizing the unique cultural, historical, 
and political circumstances of Native American tribes across the United States. It has provided a legal framework that 
respects the sovereignty of tribal nations and aims to prevent the unwarranted removal of Nat ive American children 
from their families and communities. The ICWA has been  an instrumental tool in rectifying past injustices  and 
addressing the devastating impact of forced assimilation policies . 
 
 With  the recent discussions surrounding the potential o verturning of the federal ICWA, it is crucial to 
proactively consider alternative measures at the state level. State governments must assume responsibility for 
ensuring that Native American children continue to receive the protection and support they deser ve. Implementing a 
state- level Indian Child Welfare Act will be a critical step forward in safeguarding the rights and well- being of Native 
American children within the jurisdiction of our state. By enacting this legislation, we would demonstrate our 
comm itment to upholding principles of justice, cultural preservatio n, and community well -being. A state -level ICWA 
would ensure that Native American children and families receive equal protection under the law, regardless of any potential changes at the f ederal level.  
  By maintaining the core principles of the federal ICWA at the state level, we can:  
 
• Safeguard the best interests of Native American children: A state -level ICWA would prioritize the best 
interests of Native American children, ensuring that t heir cultural and emotional needs are met. It would 
provide stability and promote their overall well- being, while also acknowledging the importance of 
maintaining their connection to their tribal community and heritage.  
 
• Respect tribal sovereignty: The sta te-level ICWA would recognize and respect the sovereignty of Native 
American tribes within our state's borders. It would foster a collaborative relationship between state 
agencies and tribal governments, ensuring that decisions about the welfare of Native American children are 
made with the active involvement and input of their respective tribal communities.  
 
• Preserve cultural identity and heritage: Native American children possess a rich cultural identity that 
deserves to be preserved and nurtured. A state- level ICWA would prioritize the preservation of their cultural 
heritage, language, and traditions, enabling them to grow up with a strong sense of belonging and pride in 
their Native American heritage.  
 
• Promote community well- being: Native American commun ities thrive when their children and families are 
supported and empowered. By enacting a state- level ICWA, we would be fostering the well -being and 
resilience of Native American communities within our state, thereby contributing to their overall social, 
cultural, and economic development.  
 
 It is my sincere hope that you will consider my testimony and support the implementation of the Maine 
Indian Child Welfare Act. Together, we can ensure that Native American children are protected, their cultural 
herit age is respected, and their future is filled with opportunities to thrive within their families and communities.
