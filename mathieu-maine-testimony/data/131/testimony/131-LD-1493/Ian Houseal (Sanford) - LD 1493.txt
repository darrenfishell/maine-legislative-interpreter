Dear Committee on Taxation , 
This letter is written in support of LD 14 93.  Programs and policies  to incentivize housing creation are so 
desperately  needed to spur housing development in Maine .   
This bill would  allow municipalities  like Sanford to wrap a construction and electricity  sales tax 
exemption around a Tax  Increment Finan cing (TIF) District  targeted to building workforce and affordable 
housing in partnership  with the private sector.   
This new tool will be  an important tool in a municipalit yâ€™s limited toolbox  to incentivize housing creation  
in Maine .   
Sanford  will take advantage of this new TIF program if it is authorized  and continue to try to increase the 
supply of hous ing. 
For those reasons, the City of Sanford supports this bill.  
Sincerely , 
Ian Houseal  
Director of Community Development
