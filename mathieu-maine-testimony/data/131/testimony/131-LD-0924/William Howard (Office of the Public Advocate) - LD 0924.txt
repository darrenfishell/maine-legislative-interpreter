Administrative Director 
Maine Public Utilities Commission

RE: Public Utilities Commission 
Request for Proposals for Renewable Energy Generation and Transmission Projects 
Pursuant to the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program 
Docket No. 2021-00369 
Dear Mr. Lanphear, 
I am writing to follow up recent announcements regarding procurement of 
renewable energy form Northern Maine. 
The Office of Public Advocate is charged with ensuring our statutory policies 
and regulatory proceedings provide for affordable, high quality utility services. OPA 
has consistently advocated for the need to aggressively and cost effectively makea 
clean energy transition to help mitigate the harmful effects on Maine residents due to 
price swings caused by our overreliance on fossil fuels. We believe one way to 
accomplish that goal is through competitive bidding in order to bring more grid-scale 
renewables online. That is why we were encouraged to see the Maine Legislature pass 
LD 1710, "An Act To Require Prompt and Effective Use of the Renewable Energy 
Resources of Northern Maine." 
Importantly, this law did not mandate that our Maine Public Utilities 
Commission approve any project or line at any cost - rather, it introduced a 
competitive bid process that encouraged the most cost-effective generation projects, 
while also seeking bids for responsibly sited transmission lines using existing rights of 
way as much as possible. 
As the PUC noted in its November 1, 2022 Qrder, the winning generation and
l
transmission bids best meet the relevant statutory criteria regarding cost and allowing 
the state to move toward meetings its renewable goals while maximizing economic 
benefits to the state. But even after the PUC's decision, one additional hurdle 
remained: the statutory directive to seek additional partners who may wish to purchase 
some of the output of these facilities. On December 30, 2022, pursuant to its 
statutory authority, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources issued its 
favorable decision that their participation in Maine's procurement would indeed 
qualify for its beneﬁcial determination. This is no small feat and would be the first 
time Maine has ever directly partnered with another state in New England for clean 
energy development. 
The Commonwealth's participation is a major milestone for Maine to be able 
to import the beneﬁts of our clean energy transition, while also exporting some of 
the associated costs. Notably, Massachusetts ’ participation in helping to fund these 
projects expires on February 28, 2023 should the Maine PUC not finalize contracts 
for l\/laine's participation in these projects. 
Please let me know if there is anything OPA can do to help meet this deadline. We 
are hopeful the Corninission can move toward ﬁnalizing these winning bids and 
turning them into long~term contracts so that B/Iaine ratepayers can beneﬁt from 
them for years to come. 
Sincerely, 
/>1/a.» /ta/were
