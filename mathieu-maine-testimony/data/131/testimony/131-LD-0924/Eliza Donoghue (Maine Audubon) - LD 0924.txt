RE:
LD
924,
Resolve,
to
Provide
Legislative
Approval
of
Northern
Maine
T ransmission
Infrastructure
Dear
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler ,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
924,
Resolve,
to
Provide
Legislative
Approval
of
Northern
Maine
T ransmission
Infrastructure,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members
and
supporters.
Maine
Audubon
supports
this
legislation
as
the
next
step
among
many
to
responsibly
meet
Maine’ s
climate
and
clean
ener gy
goals.
In
order
for
Maine
to
meet
our
ambitious
and
necessary
greenhouse
gas
emission
reduction
tar gets,
we
must
significantly
increase
renewable
ener gy
development.
New
renewable
ener gy
generation
at
a
scale
necessary
to
meet
those
tar gets
will
require
additional
transmission
capacity
and
development.
But
like
all
development,
including
all
ener gy
production,
renewable
ener gy
resources
and
transmission
impart
their
own
ecological
footprint
and
can
have
negative
impacts
on
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat,
as
well
as
cumulative
impacts
across
ecologically
significant
landscapes.
T ransmission
corridors
can
have
significant
negative
impacts
on
wildlife
populations
and
habitats.
Linear
habitat
alterations,
like
transmission
corridors,
cut
the
natural
landscape
into
smaller
pieces,
which
is
problematic
for
species
that
need
lar ge
unbroken
blocks
of
habitat
to
thrive.
For
other
species,
fragmenting
features
may
cut
them
of f
from
important
pieces
of
their
habitat
like
breeding
grounds
or
high
quality
feeding
areas.
Some
animals
are
unable
to
traverse
the
opening—such
as
salamanders
that
cannot
cross
a
dry ,
open
right-of-way
on
a
hot
summer
day—while
other
species
will
not
cross
the
opening
because
it
makes
them
vulnerable
to
predators.
These
are
just
some
of
the
negative
impacts
of
transmission
corridors
on
wildlife.
But
transmission
is
necessary;
we
need
to
move
renewable
ener gy
from
where
it
is
generated
to
where
it
will
be
used.
Thankfully ,
many
strategies
exist
to
avoid
or
minimize
these
negative
impacts,
including:

●
A void
rare,
sensitive,
and
high
value
habitats,
including
important
wildlife
movement
corridors
(used
daily ,
seasonally ,
or
over
a
lifespan)
and
highly
resilient
landscapes;
●
Prior
to
development,
in
order
to
avoid
or
minimize
site-specific
impacts,
conduct
surveys
to
identify
and
understand
site-specific
wildlife
habitats;
●
Locate
projects
near
existing
development;
●
Evaluate
potential
cumulative
impacts,
considering
existing
development
and
potential
for
future
development
at
a
site;
and
●
Co-locate
new
transmission
lines
into
existing
right-of-ways,
roads,
or
other
existing
man-made
linear
features.
Maine
Audubon
is
pleased
that
the
legislation
that
called
for
new
Northern
Maine
T ransmission
Infrastructure
requires
that
new
lines
utilize
existing
right-of-ways.
W e’re
also
pleased
that
those
who
are
developing
this
infrastructure
are
already
reaching
out
to
environmental
non-profits
and
natural
resource
agencies
to
receive
recommendations
on
strategies
to
minimize
the
impacts
of
the
new
line.
W e
are
optimistic
that
this
line,
with
due
diligence,
will
minimize
impacts
to
Maine’ s
environment
while
maximizing
Maine’ s
ener gy
production
potential.
It
is
with
that
optimism
that
Maine
Audubon
supports
LD
924.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
