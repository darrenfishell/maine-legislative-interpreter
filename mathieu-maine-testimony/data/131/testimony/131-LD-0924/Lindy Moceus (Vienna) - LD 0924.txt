Comments on     LD 924   Resolve, to Provide Legislative Approval of Northern Maine 
Transmission Infrastructure

I am an environmentalist and strongly oppose LD 924 (Big Pine Wind Project in Aroostook County.)  
Below is a map that I got online from the Maine Dept. of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife website.  (You 
can access this interactive map at: https://webapps2.cgis-

This is a map of Webbertown Township which is the site of the Big Pine Wind Project.  The teal green 
areas designate ‘inland wading bird and waterfowl habitats’.   As you can see, these areas are 
substantial!  Imagine putting 179 wind turbines in the midst of all of that!   Could there be anything 
worse?
Looking back a hundred years from now (or even 50 years) success will be measured by how much 
natural habitat, contiguous woodlands, and wildlife species still remain.  It will not be how much more 
developed and populated this land became like all the areas south of there.  Northern Maine is noted for 
its extensive forests and wildlife.  Such areas are now rare and should be prized and protected!   Yet 
there are those who continue to push economic development above all else.  When does this stop, after 
it is all gone?  
With this bill, Maine rate payers will fork out $1,000,000,000 which will greatly enrich a Boston based 
developer while wiping out the bird population in Webbertown township and greatly impacting other 
wildlife.   Please do not support this very short-sighted bill (project).  Thank you for your consideration.
