Testimony in Opposition to LD 924
Resolve, to Provide Legislative Approval of Northern Maine Transmission Infrastructure 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Energy, Utilities and Technology:
I am writing this testimony in opposition to LD 924, “Resolve, to Provide Legislative Approval of
Northern Maine Transmission Infrastructure.” My name is Nathan Gould.
It wasn’t long ago when I and my fellow citizens were bombarded with claims of the Central 
Maine Power Corridor being a “bad deal for Maine.” Let me keep this simple: I do not see why putting 
up transmission lines in northern Maine is preferable to a stretch of land being used to bring 
hydropower to Maine. If there is no generation source, why are we committing land and money to this
project whereas the Central Maine Power Corridor, having an ample source of power, was turned 
down over concerns regarding land usage? And if there was a generation source, such as solar, is 
turning thousands of acres of land into solar farms and a better deal than 1,200 MW of clean energy 
from Hydro-Québec?
Even if one ignores comparisons to the NECEC line, this Northern Maine Transmission 
Infrastructure threatens expenses that outweigh a good return on investment. More evidence to the 
contrary is needed before a commitment is made. Ratepayers—our neighbors who already are 
suffering unneeded economic hardship—need better solutions to rising prices. We need a better deal 
than the one offered in this bill.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
