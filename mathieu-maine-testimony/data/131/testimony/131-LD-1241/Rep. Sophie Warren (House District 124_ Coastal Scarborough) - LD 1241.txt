April 10, 2023 Testimony of Representative Sophie Warren Presenting LD 1241, An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or Crossbow Before the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife  Senator Lafountain, Representative Landry and my esteemed colleagues on the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife committee, good morning! When I was asked to sponsor this bill I was so excited because I have been focusing on reaching out to all of my constituents with the legislation I bring forward. As a legislator who ran on the issues of environmental protection and climate change, I see LD 1241 as a bill which reflects a modest compromise in how we share our natural resources and advance economic fairness to all Mainers.  This legislation reaches out to the working-class hunters that are often forgotten by Maine Legislators. We hear from the well-to-do sportsmen all the time, about their wants, needs, and aspirations. We hear from wealthy landowners about how the legislature should be treating them all the time. They do not have any barriers to advocate for themselves, or hire a lobbyist to advocate for them. Working class hunters however do have a barrier: it’s called “work.” They can’t be here today, they can’t come to the public hearing and they can’t make their voice heard because they are busy feeding their families, changing diapers, sorting through coupons to make their grocery list more affordable, taking over time so they can afford heating oil. They can’t be here today, but we can. And that is why I am excited to introduce this legislation that will give them what hunters around the country have access to- hunting on Sundays. If you need to understand how simple of an idea hunting on Sunday is, just know that Maine is one of two states in the entire country that does not have some form of Sunday hunting. 48/50 states allow their citizens to hunt on Sunday. A common argument I hear is that other states do not have the same land access laws that we do. So, we surveyed New Hampshire and Vermont. We spoke with a hunter in NH and a former state Senator in VT. Both confirmed, they have the same land access laws and they also have Sunday hunting. So, please do your own research as you consider this bill and fact check that claim!   I am happy to sponsor a bill that has double digit support, 48% of the state supports this bill while only 27% oppose with 25% being neutral. That’s big, it is a clear poll done by a polling firm that regularly contracts with Maine DOT, the Maine Office of the Public Advocate and even Jackson Labs. They are well respected and this poll should be firmly trusted. I am happy that this bill supports Land for Maine’s future, an important program that will secure our woodlands for generations to come. I am happy that his bill supports our esteemed wardens HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 2 STATE HOUSE STATION AUGUSTA, MAINE  04333-0002 (207) 287-1400 TTY: MAINE RELAY 711  Sophie Warren P.O.

service, they said Sunday hunting may lead to more enforcement calls which we heard, so we are funding them with this bill. Most of all, I am happy that this bill will do something to stave off the drop in youth outdoor participation by providing funding for programs that get them into the woods. If hunters get another day in the woods, they should give back. We strike a balance here that everyone in Maine can live with, I look forward to seeing this bill become law. Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Sincerely, Sophie Warren
