To the Joint Legislative Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in the 131st Session
Against LD 1241 to Allow Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or Crossbow 
Honorable Members of the IF&W Committee, Chairs Senator LaFountain and Representative 
Landry. My name is Stuart H. Reese. I am having my forester write on behalf of myself and 
Elizabeth G. Reese, my wife, owners of approximately 2.500 acres of Maine forest land. We 
allow managed hunting on some of the properties. 
This bill does not even propose any limit in Sunday hunting to the ordinary fall seasons 
for birds, deer and moose. It allows Sunday hunting day and night for coyotes nine months of 
the year and then for all species in the day for the rest of the year.
Sunday hunting at any time is unacceptable to us and we are startled that an excessive 
proposal like this for Sunday hunting throughout the year would be made.
We strongly oppose this bill and ask that you please vote in opposition.
Thank you for your consideration and for your public service,
Signed on behalf of and at the request of Stuart H. Reese and Elizabeth G. Reese
D. Gordon Mott, Maine Forester #772
