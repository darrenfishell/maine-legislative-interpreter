Testimony of Rep. Aaron Dana supporting 
LD 1241, An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or Crossbow 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee, my name is Aaron Dana, and I am the Tribal Representative from the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe and I come before you to testify in support of LD 1241, An Act to Allow 
Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or Crossbow that is before this committee ’s 
consideration. 
Maine is known for abundant Wildlife and natural resources. Hunting has been an integral pait of 
Maine’s culture and economy for centuries. However in recent years, the number of hunters has 
been declining and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) is 
constantly looking for ways to attract new hunters. 
One of the ways to attract more hunters is by allowing Sunday archery hunting in Maine. 
Currently, Maine prohibits all hunting on Sundays except for Coyote and crow hunting. This is 
in contrast to many other states that allow hunting on Sundays. 
Second, Sunday archery hunting would boost Maine’s economy. Hunting generates millions of 
dollars in revenue each year. By allowing Sunday hunting, more hunters would come to Maine, 
stay in local hotels, eat at local restaurants and buy hunting equipment from local stores. 
Third, Sunday archery hunting would help protect Maine’s natural resources. Hunting is a vital 
part of conservation, and hunters play a critical role in protecting Maine’s forests, wetlands and 
other natural habitats. By allowing Sunday hunting, more hunters would be able to participate in 
conservation efforts and help preserve Maine’s environment for future generations. 
In conclusion, Sunday archery hunting would beneﬁt Maine in numerous ways. It would provide 
more opportunities for hunters, boost Maine’s economy, help manage wildlife populations and 
protect Maine’s natural resources. It is time for Maine to join other states in allowing Sunday 
hunting and reap the beneﬁts that come with it. Thank you for your consideration of LD 1241 
and I would be happy to answer any questions at this time.
