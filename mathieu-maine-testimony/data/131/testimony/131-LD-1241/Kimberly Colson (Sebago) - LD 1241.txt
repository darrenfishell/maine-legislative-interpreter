LD 1241
Bill LD 1241 is a just another deceptive way to allow hunting in Maine of Sundays. 
Bows and arrows and crossbows are deadly weapons.  As a hiker and woodlot owner 
I am opposed to ALL hunting in Maine on Sundays.  We need at least one day a week
when we can hike and use our woodlot without the fear of being shot by bullets, bows
and arrows and crossbows arrows.  I am opposed to LD 1241.  The constant barrage 
of bills to support hunting on Sundays is why I will post my woodlot as a no hunting 
area (no hunting any day of the week, to guns, bows and arrows and crossbows, and 
any other weapon).  Of course, arrows do not recognize property lines. This means 
Sunday is still my only safe day to be in the woods as long as Maine respects no 
hunting on Sunday.
