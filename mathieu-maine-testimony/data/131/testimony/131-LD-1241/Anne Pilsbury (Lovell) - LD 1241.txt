 I am a woodlot owner in Oxford County. I own approximately 90 acres which I love 
to tramp around in and preseRV.e for wildlife -- and occasional hunters. I have never 
posted my land but I would like to have ONE DAY during hunting season when I do 
not have to worry about a stray bullet or the crack of gunfire. Please defeat all these 
sunday hunting bills!
