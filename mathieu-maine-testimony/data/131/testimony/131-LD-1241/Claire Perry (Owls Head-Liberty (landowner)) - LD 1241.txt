Dear IF&W Committee Members 
I am writing in opposition to LD 1241
Maine has this rare thing happening right now, that you might not to mess with. It's 
about a perfect stranger carrying a lethal weapon, entering you land, unknown to you, 
and without the need of asking for your permission.
If people don't stop pushing these Sunday bills at us...this is going to end.  We, the 
landowners, are getting sick of it.  
There is no need of instituting Sunday hunting. None. 
There is plenty of need to be worried about REVERSE POSTING. 
Reverse Posting may be our future, with or without Sunday hunting, if the hunting 
community doesn't stop asking for more and more; and continue to GET more and 
more. 
"Death by a Thousand Cuts" doesn't apply only to the "antis."
Thank You.
