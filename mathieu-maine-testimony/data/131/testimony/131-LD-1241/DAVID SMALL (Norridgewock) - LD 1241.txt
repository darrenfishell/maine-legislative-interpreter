LD 1241
I previously submitted testimony on LDs 626 and 1166, but did not have time to add 
my objections to LD 1241. I would like to do so at this time. For the same reasons 
that I objected to the other to bills, I also object to LD 1241. Although bow and 
crossbow hunting MIGHT not present the same level of danger to others as does 
firearm hunting, it still presents enough of a danger to warrant it receiving an "ought 
not to pass" vote. If, however, it does pass, I will post my one thousand plus acres 
against all hunting in order to assure the safety of my guests and other non hunters on 
my property. I do not believe that having one day per week during hunting seasons, to
assure their safety against an inherent danger, is too much for others to ask. Thank 
you.
