Please oppose LD 1241 An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting with a Bow and Arrow or 
Crossbow. 
The Sunday hunting ban has been in place since the 1880s, and despite multiple 
attempts to overturn it, Mainers continue to uphold the ban. Introducing yet another 
bill specifying that only certain types of hunting equipment can be utilized does 
nothing to hide the fact that this is another attempt by a minority to find a “back door”
into allowing Sunday hunting for what appears to be one purpose, and then using that 
foothold to expand on an activity that Maine citizens DO NOT WANT. How many 
times must Maine citizens explicitly state that they do NOT want to allow hunting on 
Sundays?  In fact, in a 2021 survey by the IFW, the MAJORITY OPPOSED Sunday 
hunting. Overturning the Sunday hunting ban also does not make sense due to the 
ongoing trend of an overall decline in hunting.
