As a rural Maine landowner, I am opposed to Sunday hunting in any form. I enjoy 
walking in my woods with my children, and want at least one day where I don't have 
to worry about one of us being shot by a hunter who is drunk or has bad aim, while 
we are on our own land.  
While I know many hunters are responsible, not all are. It is not uncommon for me to 
find garbage, beer cans and shell casings on my property during hunting season.  I 
understand the Maine tradition of hunting, but I want to be able to recreate on my 
property, worry free. Please vote 'no' on this bill.
