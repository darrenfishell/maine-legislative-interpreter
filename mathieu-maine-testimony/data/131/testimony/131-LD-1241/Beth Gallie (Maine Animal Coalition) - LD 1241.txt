RE: In Opposition to 1241 An Act to Allow Sunday H unting with a Bow and Arrow or 
Crossbow  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representat ive Landry , and members of the Committee on Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife : 
 
My name is Beth Gallie and  I am Pres ident of Main e Animal Coalition.  Maine Animal 
Coalition is a not for profit dedicated to the elimination of animal abuse and e xploitation 
through education, advocacy, and example.  
Maine Animal Coalition opposes hunting on Sunday  and is against LD 1241, L D 626,      
LD 1166 and LD 672 .  And according to the Department of In land Fish eries and Wildlife , 
55% of Mainers oppose Sunday hunting.  We really apprecia te that the Maine Legislature 
has allow ed us one day a week to enjoy nature without concern for hunt ers. Please 
donâ€™t stop this t radition.
