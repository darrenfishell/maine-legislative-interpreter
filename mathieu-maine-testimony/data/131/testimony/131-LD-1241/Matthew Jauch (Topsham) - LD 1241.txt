Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, 
As an archer and landowner, I ask you to support and pass LD 1241. Since I currently work 8-5 Monday 
through Friday and am a parent to two young children my archery hunting is effectively limited to 
weekends, which in Maine equates to Saturdays only. Currently 48 states allow Sunday hunting in one 
form or another---the holdouts are only Maine and Massachusetts1. Given our stateâ€™s history it is now 
time again to separate from Massachusetts and allow Sunday archery hunting. Research shows the most 
prevalent accidents/incidents associated with archery hunting are falls from tree stands which pose no 
threat to non-hunters and can be mitigated through use of a harness2. As such, opponents to this law 
have little to fear and their access to the great outdoors will remain unencumbered while allowing 
myself and others one more opportunity to embrace nature and potentially feed our families. 
Thank you, 
Matthew R. Jauch
