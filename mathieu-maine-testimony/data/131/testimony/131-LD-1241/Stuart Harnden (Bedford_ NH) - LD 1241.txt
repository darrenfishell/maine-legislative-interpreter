Stuart Harnden
Bedford, NH
LD 1241
Please vote against bill LD 1241 Sunday hunting with a Bow and Arrow, or 
Crossbow.  There should be no Sunday hunting, this bill will lead to hunting with 
rifles and is a foot in the door for Sunday Hunting.  I have 100 acres of land available 
to the public for 6 days a week, I feel that is sufficient.
