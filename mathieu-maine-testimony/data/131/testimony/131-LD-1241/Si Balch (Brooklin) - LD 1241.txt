I thank all the legislators for putting in so much time serving Maine's people. 
Hello Russell; I was a Wilton town resident for 34 years. l usually agree with you, but this 
time l do not. 
Committee Members: 
l am a Maine licensed forester and have been working throughout the state for 52 years 
with very kind of landowner. I support hunting. 
Supporters of these bills should be working to improve relationships with landowners, 
instead they are damaging them. 
As believers in majority rule, since that is how you got elected, you should pay attention 
to the opinion polls that reject all the proposals to force land to be open to hunting on 
Sunday. 
You are probably supporters of landowner rights, and now you are trying to take them 
away.' 
Our 50 acres of family land are open to hunting. lt is NOT posted, but people tend to 
ask permission anyway. l have said yes to every request so far. The future is uncertain. 
Unfortunately, some of my neighbors already close their land, and forcing Sunday 
hunting will make many others post land that is now open. 
Your committee should be working to reduce the amount of land closed to hunting, not 
passing legislation that will increase closures. 
The arguments for youth hunting, bow hunting and landowners allowed hunting on 
Sunday are a sideshow to confuse the real issue. The camel's nose under the tent. 
I am happy to answer questions.
