I am a private landowner in Stow. I spent time on my land with my kids and 
grandkids. If the wish to hunt they can - but not on Sundays. That’s when the public 
has access to our trails and that’s when we work our land without worrying about 
hunters. The Sunday hunting ban is an all or nothing affair. Any modification will 
render it useless and dangerous to the non-hunting public.
