I would like to say for the record, again, that as one who lives near land often 
accessed by hunters, I oppose ANY and ALL hunting on Sundays. Whether that be by
bow & arrow or crossbow. I have been in the forests when guns are shot, and they 
sound very close. Scarier if I knew there might be bows in the area. Being close to 
NH and MA, I have seen out of state plates on side of Bartlett Rd. I can tell they are 
hunters, because they are not parked in designated partking areas for the town forests. 
I have been walking in the forests and cross path with a hunter at his perch. 
Unnerving. Despite having houses in the visible vicinity, there are still hunters in the 
area. Many local people have dogs and the trails are heavily used by walkers, runners,
and bicyclists. Hunting is allowed in the local town Land Trusts.  The trail volunteers 
were making trails one day, avoiding certain sections of the forest for protection of 
the wildlife; I asked which wildlife in particular, because according to list of 
allowable game....they are all hunted...some all year round!!??  How about saving one
day of the week for recreational users who are not killing, without having to worry 
about hunters. Especially Youth hunters who may or may not have less good 
decision-making skills.
