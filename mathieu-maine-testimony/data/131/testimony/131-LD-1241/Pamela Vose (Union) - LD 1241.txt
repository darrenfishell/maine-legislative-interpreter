TO: Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident and landowner in the town of Union.  
I am submitting testimony against LD 1241 An Act to Allow Sunday Hunting with a 
Bow and Arrow or Crossbow
I would like to start out by saying that I am not anti-hunting and appreciate the 
traditions of hunting passed on by generations in my family. One of these traditions is
NO SUNDAY HUNTING.
I speak as a citizen and landowner who appreciates, uses and has a need to be in the 
woods during deer hunting season and finds the ever-expanding hunting season to be 
a concern.  There are many of us who have other reasons to be out in our beautiful 
Maine woods during the fall and cannot do so safely during deer hunting season.  We 
are as important as hunters and deserve consideration.
 
This is one more attempt to sneak Sunday hunting into the laws of Maine and I am 
disgusted.  Hunters are a minority of the population in the state of Maine and yet 
continue to push to take away the one day other Mainers can enjoy the state we all 
live in and pay taxes in.
I am strongly against yet another sneaky attempt to ignore the wishes of the majority 
of Maine citizens and landowners to keep Sunday free of any type of hunting. unless, 
of course, you want to see posted property and hunting by written permission only in 
the future.  
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on this bill.
