Taxation Committee  
 LD 286-  An Act to Authorize the Use of Tax Increment Financing F unds for Constructing or 
Renovating Municipal Offices and Other Municipal Buildings.  
 Dear Taxation Committee : 
 
I write on behalf of the Town of Thomaston in supporting LD 286. This proposed bill would be a 
tremendous benefit to our community to assist mana ging and maintain ing our municipal buildings.  
 
We are a small  mid-coast  town wit h a population of nearly 2,800. Additionally, we are a full-service  center 
for Thomaston and neighboring towns  providing Fire, EMS, Police , Municipal Services, Recreation 
Department, Public Library,  Public Works Department,  and Waste water Department  services. Providing 
these services to the community comes at a high cost to our residents  and taxpayers.  
 
To provide these services, the Town m aintains and manages  6 ageing faci lities that require continued 
repairs. In the past year, we had a few unexpected emergent repairs , that the T own had to dip into 
reserves to fund.  
 
Our Fire /EMS Station is over 75 years old and  required a full replacement of the heating system this past 
year. The Town is currently seeking a feasibility study of the Fire/EMS Station for building a new facility in 
the next 2- 3 years . Unfortunately, the heating system could not be band -aided to get us through to the 
new build.  
 
The option to use Tax Increment Financing funds to renovate and const ruct municipal buildings  would be 
a saving grace to our small town in the future new Fire/ EMS Station  building project  and would help 
lessen the burden on taxpayers  to fund the whole pr oject through bonds.  
 
Thank you for your consideration in suppor ting LD 286 on the behalf of all municipalities.  
 
 
Best,  
 
 
 
Kara George  
Town Manager
