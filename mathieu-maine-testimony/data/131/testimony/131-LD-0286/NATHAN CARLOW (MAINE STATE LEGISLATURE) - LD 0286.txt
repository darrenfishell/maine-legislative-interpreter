TESTIMONY IN  SUPPORT OF L.D. 286  
 
AN ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING FUNDS FOR 
CONSTRUCTING OR RENOVATING MUNICIPAL OFFICES AND OTHER MUNICIPAL 
BUILDINGS.

 Joint Standing Committee on Taxation c/o Benjamin Berry,  Clerk  
100 State House Station Augusta, Maine 04333-0100  Dear Colleagues:  
 
It’s an honor to be before you this afternoon to present my bill, L.D. 286, An Act to Authorize 
the Use of Tax Increment Financing Funds for Constructing or Renovating Municipal O ffices 
and Other Municipal Buildings .  I am truly humbled by the bipartisan and bicameral support this 
legislation has already received, and grateful for the opportunity to offer this testimony.   
As the Committee is aware, the 2001 overhaul of the TIF program specifically disqualifies the 
use of TIF funding for the purpose this legislation seeks to establish, and I want to begin my testimony by informing the Committee of the practical consequences caused by this omission.  
The people of Hollis, Maine, which I have the good fortune of representing in this Body, have 
been deprived of a suitable town office for many years.  The current structure located at 34 Town 
Farm Road is cramped, unstable, and deteriorating at a rapid pace.   At one point, the site was in 
imminent danger of collapse, endangering the safety and well-being of town employees and residents.   At great expense to the Town, temporary beams were constructed, extending the 
longevity of the town office by just a few years.  That was in 2017, and as time passes, the 
situation becomes more and more dire. 
 Hollis, like many communities across the State, is not a wealthy town, and if not for the TIF 
district it established in 1999, several years before the overhaul of the TIF program, it’s options would be severely limited.   Fortunately, and perhaps ironically, the Town of Hollis has the 
resources to fix this problem, but regrettably the money to do so is sitting in an account, untouched, and set to expire in just a few years, because the wisdom of the Le gislature more than

 two decades ago, was to interfere in local decision making by imposing a one- size fits all 
approach to resource allocation.  
 The legislation before you today seeks to correct this confounding provision of statute by 
modifying the current law to enable voters in a municipality with a TIF district to decide for themselves whether or not “conditions exist that impair the proper functioning of government,” as is the cas e in the community I represent, or “which otherwise hinder the vitality of the local 
economy.” 
 This policy has already been adopted by 26 other states and the District of Columbia because 
the right of a community to self- determine how best to utilize its resources is essential for the 
future success of towns and cities across America.   
 For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to support the right of communities across 
Maine to utilize local resources to solve local problems.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.  I would be delighted to answer any additional questions in 
advance of the work session.  
Sincerely,  
 
Nathan M. Carlow  
State Representative
