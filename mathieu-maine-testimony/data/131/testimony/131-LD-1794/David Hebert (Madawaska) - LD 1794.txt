Dear Committee Members, 
 
My name is David Hebert and I work at Twin Rivers Paper Company in Madawaska.  I’ve been employed 
there as a millworker for over 28 years.  20 years ago, employees would be waiting in line to try and get 
a shift of overtime.  Now it’s the complete opposite.  Around 10 years ago, our company reduced 
headcount and began mandating forced overtime to operate the mill to be competitive with other mills 
in the industry.  It has come to the point barely anyone who is seeking work wants to work at our mill 
due to the negative impacts that have resulted from forced overtime.   
I’ve seen the negative impacts firsthand in our mill; the worst case being an employee who was not 
allowed to be by their dying mother’s side as she breathed her last breath.  This is an example of the 
level of severity this problem has become.  Forced overtime has become the norm, where it should only 
be the exception.  The normalization of this practice needs to stop so workers can have a healthy 
work/life balance.  Forced overtime also causes workers to be more tired and complacent which is very 
unsafe.  Many of our employees who work at our mill live 45 minutes to 1 hour away.  They really don’t 
have much time between shifts to get proper rest and sleep, let alone spend time with family. 
I’m strongly asking that you all support LD 1794 which would limit forced overtime for Paper Workers in 
Maine. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
