District 20: Brewer (part)  April 4,  2023  
 
Testimony of Rep. Kevin O’Connell  introducing  
LD 1206 , An Act to Create a Grant Program for Workplace Health and 
Safety Improvements  
Before the Labor and Housing Committee  
  
Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder  and esteemed  members  of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing , my name is Kevin O’Connell.  I represent House District 20, which is 
most of the city of Brewer. I am here today to introduce  LD 1206 , An Act to Create a Grant 
Program for Workplace Health and Safety Improvements . 
 
This bill  requires the Maine D epartment of Labor to administer a gr ant program  which will 
provide up to $5,000 for employers to pay for health and safety improve ments. This would  cover 
things such as resources for health and safety  equipment or training .  
 
In order to qualify, a business must  have 15 or fewer full -time employees.  This grant funding is 
meant to help those employers who want to provide  additional or newer safety equipment  for 
their staff , above what they may already be required to provide,  but cannot afford to do so.  
 
I believe if the state can help mom and pop shops take additional steps to reduce the risk of 
injury or illness to workers an d promote  safe and he althy working conditions, then we should 
invest in those efforts.  
 
Thank you all for your time  and attention.
