Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
LD 1132 — “An Act to Allow Certain Liquor Sellers to Conduct Off-premises Taste-testing Events 
and Retail Sales” 
April 5, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, my name is Gregg Mineo and I am the Director of the Bureau of 
Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. I am providing the following testimony in 
opposition to LD 1132. 
LD 1132 proposes to allow agency liquor stores and off-premises retail licensees to hold one 
spirits, wine and malt liquor taste-testing event per month at a location other than the licensed 
premise. This bill would also allow sales for off-premises consumption from these off-premises 
tasting events. There are 1900 licensed retailers to whom this bill would apply. 
Current law (28-A MRS §460) already allows agency liquor stores and off-premises retail 
licensees (28-A MRS §l205 & 1207) to conduct an unlimited number of in-store taste-testing 
events. In the last two legislatures, these opportunities have been maximized from just 3 per month 
to an unlimited number. 
The Bureau feels strongly that existing law provides ample sampling opportunity for agency liquor 
stores and beer and wine retailers and should remain conﬁned to their licensed premises. Currently 
unlicensed businesses who wish to provide liquor service to their customers can hirea 
caterer/quali ﬁed caterer or partner with an incorporated civic organization. Conversely, a business 
wanting to provide liquor service to unlicensed premises can obtain a caterer/quali ﬁed caterer 
license to do so. 
Thank you for allowing me to testify before the Committee today. I am happy to answer any 
questions, and of course will be available for the work session.
