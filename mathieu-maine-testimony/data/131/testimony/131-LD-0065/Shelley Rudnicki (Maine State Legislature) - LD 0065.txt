Testimony 
In Support of 
LD 65 An Act to Require That Printing Services Provided to the General Public by the 
University of Maine System Be Provided at Market Rates 
Good Afternoon Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and distinguished members of the 
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business Committee, I am 
Representative Shelley Rudnicki. I represent House District #67, the towns of Fairﬁeld and 
Benton. I am here today to introduce LD 65 An Act to Require That Printing Services 
Provided to the General Public by the University of Maine System Be Provided at Market 
Rates 
I put this bill in on behalf of a constituent, Mr. Donald Maclntyre who Was the owner of a Print 
shop in Farmington and reached out to me a couple of years ago. 
If the University of Maine system does printing then they should be selling their services at 
market rate. The University is subsidized by the state and it has an unfair advantage over the 
private sector.- 
District 67 Fairﬁeld and Benton
