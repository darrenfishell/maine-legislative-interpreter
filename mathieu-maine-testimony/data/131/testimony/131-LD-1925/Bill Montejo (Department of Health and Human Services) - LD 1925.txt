Senator Baldaccl, Representatlve Meyer, and Members of the Jo1nt Stand1ng Comm1ttee on Health 
and Human Serv1ces, my name 1s B111 IVIOl'lli6_]O, I am the Dlrector of the D1v1s1on of L1cens1ng and 
Certlﬁcatlon (DLC) for the Department of Health and Human Serv1ces The Department thanks 
Representatlve Shagoury for sponsor1ng th1s Department b1ll I am speakmg to help 1ntroduce and 
share our support of LD 1925, An Act to Clarzﬂ and Improve the Laws Relatzng to the Background 
Check Center and the Mazne Certzﬁed Nurszng Asszstant and Dzrect Care Worker Regzstry, and 
we offer the Comm1ttee the followmg lnformatlon for your conslderatlon 
Th1s b1ll would amend the law relat1ng to the Mame Background Check Center (MBCC) 1n several 
lmportant ways, many of wh1ch constltuents and leg1slators have been requestlng for years most 
notably, 1t would allow the Ma1ne Background Check Center to add ﬁngerprlntmg to 1ts 
capab1l1t1es and allow for portable checks 
It would authorlze the collectlon of blometrlc data (ﬁngerprmts) to enable the program to access 
natlonal cr1m1nal hlstory backgrounds of potentlal employees Ma1ne healthcare fac1l1t1es have 
seen an tmprecedented mcrease 1n staff from out of state, and ut1l1zat1on of natlonal cr1m1nal hlstory 
data W111 prov1de more robust protectlon for Malners rece1v1ng healthcare serv1ces 
The b1ll would allow employees to take the1r background checks w1th them from one employer to 
another Such portablllty of background check results from one employer to another 1s not posslble 
now because of the requ1rement 1n multlple statutes that each employer pay for a background 
check If the apphcant/employee were allowed to grant perm1ss1on to sh1ft rece1pt of background 
check results to a new employer, as th1s b1ll would do, 1t would streamllne the system and reduce 
employer costs 
Th1s b1ll would ensure conslstency w1th the Ma1ne CNA and Dlrect Care Worker Reglstry (known 
as “the Reg1stry ”) determmatlon of wh1ch cr11n1nal offenses quallfy an 1nd1v1dual from 
employment as a dlrect access worker and ensure mechan1sms for rehef and walvers are conslstent 
It would establlsh the Mame Background Check Center as the noncrlmmal _|ust1ce-subm1tt1ng 
ent1ty so that we would be capable of lmplementlng a federal rap back mon1tor1ng program 1n the 
future
Thls b1ll would also amend the Reglstry of Certlﬁed Nurslng Asslstants and Dlrect Care Workers 
by llmltmg the Reg1stry's authorlty to only employees who have substantlated ﬁndlngs of abuse, 
neglect, or mlsapproprlatlon of property It would also requlre background checks to be done for 
mdlvlduals enrollmg 1n a tralnlng program for dnect care workers 
Rlght now, hospltals are not requlred to use Ma1ne’s Background Check Center (in the l1st 
establlshed at 22 MRS § 9054 (7)) Tl'l1S creates a dlsparlty between dlrect access workers 
employed at hospltals and those employed at other settlngs Thls b1ll would requlre l'1OSpIt21lS to 
use MBCC, Wl'llOl‘l would make requlrements conslstent across health care workers and employers 
The b1ll would also make a few other techmcal changes for conslstency and clarlty, lncludrng 
replaclng the term "unl1censed asslstlve person" wlth "dnect care worker" 
Of course, we hope you Wlll support these proposals to lmprove the Mame Background Check 
Center and 1ts ut1l1ty for Mame people I want to thank you for your conslderatlon of thls b1llI 
would be happy to answer any questlons you may have and w1ll attend your work SCSSiOI‘1
