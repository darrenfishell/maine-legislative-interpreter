Senator Baldaccl, Representauve Meyer and d1st1ngu1shed members of the ]o1nt Standmg Comnuttee 
on Health and Human Serv1ces, I an1Kat1e Fullam Harrls, Ch1ef Government Affaus Ofﬁcer at 
Ma1neHealth, and I am here to strongly support LD 1785, “Resolve, to Estabhsh the Blue R1bbon 
Comm1ss1on to Make Recommendat1ons to Update Laws Governrng the C011tlI111lJ.1I1 of Long-term 
Care Opuons”
I 
Ma1neHea1 ﬂ:1 1s an mtegrated non-proﬁt health care system that prov1des a contmuum of health care 
servlces to commumues throughout Mame and New Hampshire Every day, our over 22,000 care 
team members support our v1s1on of “\Y/orkmg Together so Our Commumues are the Hea1th1est 1n 
Amenca” by P1IOV1dJI1g a range of services from pnrnary and speclalty phys1c1an services toa 
conﬂnuurn of behav1oral health care services, comtnunlty and ternary hospltal care, home health 
care and a lab We also operate several nursmg fac1l1t1es that prov1de long-term care to our 
communlttes 
Thank you to Speaker Talbot Ross for recogn1z1ng the cr1s1s that Mame 1s expenencmg related to 
access to long term care and her leadersh1p 1n proposmg two b1]ls to address 1t Our elderly res1dents 
who no longer have the ab1l1ty to hve safely on the1r own and do not have the resources to pay for 
care have few, 1f any, optlons for supported I€S1d€1111al care N e1ther ass1sted hv1ng nor nurslng 
fac1l111es have sufﬁclent ava1lable capac1ty to meet the need Thls 1s, 111 part, due to stafﬁng shortages 
However, 1t 1s also a result of a convoluted, complex and annquated set of laws and regulations that 
govern res1dentlal care for Ma1ne’s elderly Yesterday, Ma1r1eHealth hosp1tals had 76 pattents who 
were ready for dlscharge but for whom there 1s no safe dlscharge d1spos111on Of those, 57 needed 
nursmg fac1]1ty beds 
The leg1sla11on before you today forms a Blue R1bbon Comm1ss1on to rev1ew the laws and 
regulauons governlng long-term care and ass1sted hvtlng fac1l1t1es, many of whlch have not been 
revttewed or changed 111 over a decade Des1gned solely to protect the State’s budget by settlng a 
permanent and static MameCare budget celhng 1n 2007, the law has evolved to prevent the 
ma1ntenance of sufﬁc1ent capac1ty needed to meet the demands of our oldest populatton 1n the 
11211011 
The cwent law and regulattons pr0v1de at least two regulatory barr1ers to marntammg and 
expandmg access to nursmg fac1l1ty services 1n Mame The ﬁrst 1s overslght-over total bed capac1ty 
through a Certiﬁcate of Need process On 1ts own, th1s can be a reasonable regulatory check on 
oversupply of serv1ces

The second, however, 1s the so-called “Ma1neCare budget neutrahty test” that the CON process 
11‘I1POS6S on nursmg fac1l1t1es seeklng to add new beds -- or build a new or replacement fac1l1ty that 
adds beds to the overall statew1de total The Ma1neCare neutrality test requttes them to show that 
the resulting Ma1neCare rennbursable costs fo1low1ng nnplementanon of the P13016612 w1ll not exceed 
the MaineCare costs that are re1mbursed under the1r ex1st1ng bed conﬁguration This prov1s1on 1s 
found at Subsectton 1-A of Secnon 334-A of the CON law 
Th1s seermngly 11‘I1POSS1l)l6 test can only be met by showmg that the lncreased Ma1neCare costs -- 
and rermbursement revenues ﬂowmg from the add1tional beds -- w1ll be fully offset or “neuttalrzed ” 
by Ma1neCare savings from other steps they may take——through changes 1n the bed conﬁguratton or 
serv1ces of the fac1l1ty under rev1ew Or at other fac1l1t1es under common ownershrp Or from 
allocanng a suff1c1ent amount of MaineCare savmgs that DHHS has recogmzed 1n the form of so— 
called “bed nghts” 
In p1act1ce, these offsetting Ma1neCare sav1ngs have been achleved 1n one of followrng ways 
<0 By reducing or delicensing beds in another part of the facility they are seeking to expand 
<0 By reducing or delicensing beds at another facility under common ownership 
Q By drawing down on previously reserved ”bed rights" resulting from prior closures or 
bed reductions at their other affiliated facilities, or 
Q By purchasing "bed rights" from another nursing facility or chain that is willing to sell 
them 
This MaineCare neutrality test, which is a required element of the CON process for nursing 
facilities, most certainly does not take into account inflationary labor and construction costs 
and, as a result, has caused a downward spiral in the number of long-term care beds available 
to meet the needs of our population It has further created a gray market in which ”bed rights" 
—the ability to bill MaineCare for services - are bought and sold, and unused licensed bed 
capacity horded for a rainy day It is a system that puts finances, not patient needs, at is core 
I have attached a graph that rllustrates the reducnon 1n nursmg faclllty patients over t1me Hospltals 
are reqmred to hold patrents pendmg a safe discharge G1ven the number of patlents stuck 1n 
hospltals, th1s rllustrates the very real problem of lack of adequate capac1ty to meet the needs of our 
populanon as 1t ]eopardJzes the health of those who no longer belong 1n an Jnpattent setting 
Ma1neHealth owns several nursmg fac1l1t1es, mcludmg St ]oseph’s Manor 111 Portland We expanded 
capac1ty through an emergency CON during the pandemlc When 1t became clear that we needed to 
mamtatn the addlnonal capac1ty after the PHE exprres to meet the needs of our commumty, we had 
to purchase — for m1ll1ons of dollars - “bed r1ghts” to do so 
The Certiﬁcate of Need process, bed banking, and re1mbursement mechanlsms should be rev1ewed 
to better understand the 1mpact these pol1c1es have on the lack of access to long~term care It 1s clear 
that the status quo 1s not workrng just recently, yet another long-term care facrlrty announced 1ts 
closure, addmg to the 288 long-terrn care beds that permanently closed 1n the past year, and the =7.-L- 
nearly 1,300 more that are hcensed but unstaffed Li 
Not only are these outdated pol1c1es fa1l1ng to meet the needs of our most vulnerable, but the cr1s1s _ ____ 
111lOI1g —t6I111 care 1s also slgmﬁcantly rrnpacung the ab1l1ty of hosp1ta1s to contlnue to meet the acute
care needs of out pattents \X/lthout ttmely access to resldenttal care, our local health systems’ census 
and average length of stay have steadtly mcreased s1nce the start of the pandemlc Unul Flscal Year 
2021, Mame Med1cal Center’s average length of stay for pattents hovered around 5 days That ﬁgure 
has now sprked to almost 7 5 days Included 1n my tesumony are graphs that show the mcreased 
length of stay at Mame Medtcal Center and Southern Mame Health Care 
To further lllustrate the c1:1s1s, Marne Medlcal Center’s discharges to long-tenn care facﬂltres have 
decreased by 69% smce 2019 In fact, 1n an effort to prov1de safe, hlgh-quahty, and appropnate care 
to our pauents awalttng a long-term care bed, Mame Medlcal Center has started a program called 
“Trans1t1onal Care Commun111es, ” wlnch cohorts these pauents 1n the hospltal and offers an 
act1v1t1es coordinator who helps the patrent ma1nta1n cogmuve, physlcal, and emononal well-bemg 
wh1le awarung appropnate placement Tlns 1s snnply not acceptable Mame Med1cal Center 1s bemg 
forced to bear the ﬁnanc1al burden of canng for these pauents, mcludmg prov1d1ng support serv1ces 
that should be prov1ded 1n the commumty, but our post-acute care provrders cannot afford to 
prov1de them 
As a state, we must 1mmed1ate1y 1nvest 1n the serv1ces needed to address the cr1s1s we face today We 
cannot conunue to let outdated pol1c1es remaJn m place that are prevenung the development ofa 
sustarnable system of c_are that w1ll meet both the 1mtned1ate and projected needs of our 
comn1un1t1es I urge you to support the fortnatlon of th.1s Blue Rlbbon Commlsslon so thata 
thoughtful and comprehensrve rev1ew of the pol1c1es governmg long-term care can begm, and 
meamngful change can occur 
Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questtons you may have
