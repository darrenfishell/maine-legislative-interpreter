Testimony of Angela Cole Westhoff, President and CEO 
Maine Health Care Association 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Health & Human Services 
May 10, 2023 at 10 O0 AM 
In support of LD 1785, Resolve, to Establish the Blue Ribbon Commission to Make 
Recommendations to Update Laws Governing the Continuum of Long-term Care Options 
Good morning Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Health and Human Services My name IS Angela Westhoff, and I serve as the 
President & CEO ofthe Maine Health Care Association We represent approximately 200 
nursing homes, assisted living, and residential care facilities (also known as Private Non-Medical 
Institutions or PNMls) across the state Our mission is to empower members to ensure the 
integrity, quality, and sustainability of long term care in Maine 
I am here today to present testimony in support of LD 1785, Resolve, to Establish the Blue 
Ribbon Commission to Make Recommendations to Update Laws Governing the Continuum of 
Long-term Care Options This resolve seeks to establish the Blue Ribbon Commission to make 
recommendations to update laws governing residential options for individuals needing services 
including long term care, assisted living facilities, and other licensed residential options It also 
includes language regarding making recommendations to the legislature on changes to State 
laws in order to reflect changing demographics and labor market conditions to ensure capacity 
will meet the current and future ineeds for the people of Maine 
Maine's long term care facilities are struggling As I have testified before, we have experienced 
15 facility closures since 2020, and there was a recent announcement for additional closures 
coming in the next few months There are several key factors driving this pattern—they include 
lagging and inadequate reimbursement rates, a workforce shortage of epic proportions, and 
skyrocketing costs Even prior to the pandemic, nursing homes were facing these challenges,
\
but COVID-19 has exacerbated them to an unprecedented level In a recent national report, 
78% of nursing homes and 61% of assisted living communities are concerned that workforce 
challenges might force them to close ‘The availability of nursing staff has impacted long term 
care occupancy across the country and in Maine as providers are being forced to limit 
admissions due to a lack of staff As facilities have to close beds due to the lack of staff, they are 
also forced to hire expensive contractive labor through temporary nurse agencies to ensure 
they have enough staff to care for the residents they do have All of this results in the long term 
care industry being in an extremely fragile state 
This legislation seeks to create a Blue Ribbon Commission to study labor market conditions, 
make projections over the next 10 years and examine laws governing MaineCare coverage and 
payment, among other duties The state's demographics are changing We are the oldest state 
in the nation, and our population's need for long term care supports and services will only 
continue to grow The Department is beginning its rate reform process, and we are actively 
participating The new rate IS slated to be ready by 2025, yet we will continue to have facility 
closures as reimbursement rates do not cover the costs of providing care, and costs are 
skyrocketing The financial pressure facilities are under IS immense While we have seen some 
improvements in occupancy, we have not reached pre-pandemic levels and labor challenges 
continue to threaten the stability of this industry The workforce shortage IS predicted to take 
at least another four years to begin to recover 
It is important to review the laws governing residential options for individuals who need these 
services However, recognizing the fragility of the long term care sector, it is equally important 
to adequately fund these services now and make investments for the future While we study, 
review, and make recommendations based upon data and evidence, we also must ensure we 
are not allowing further deterioration of access to long term care Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide comments today, and I would be happy to answer any questions
