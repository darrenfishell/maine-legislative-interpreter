Greeting
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
James
T assé
and
I
submit
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
is
the
statewide
or ganization
that
advocates
for
bicyclists
and
pedestrians,
and
to
protect
the
safety
and
rights
of
vulnerable
users
of
the
public
ways.
The
Coalition
supports
LD
1551,
with
an
amendment
to
remove
Section
2,
the
"treat
red
lights
as
stop
signs"
provision.
This
would
limit
bicycles
to
only
treating
stop
signs
as
yield
signs,
and
would
align
the
bill
with
policy
that
has
been
found
to
result
in
meaningful
reductions
in
bicycle
crashes.
Laws
permitting
bicycle
rides
to
treat
stop
signs
as
yield
signs
date
back
to
1982,
when
Idaho
first
adopted
the
policy .
Crash
rates
for
bicycle
riders
fell,
and
other
states
began
to
implement
similar
laws.
A
2022
National
Highway
T raf fic
Safety
Administration
(NHTSA)
resource
(atttached
to
this
testimony)
notes
that
in
2017,
Delaware
adopted
a
similar ,
limited
stop-as-yield
law ,
known
as
the
"Delaware
Y ield.”
T raf fic
crashes
involving
bicyclists
at
stop
sign
intersections
fell
by
23%
in
the
30
months
after
the
law’ s
passage,
compared
to
the
previous
30
months.
Currently ,
eight
states
in
the
United
States
have
similar
laws,
and
the
2022
NHTSA
resource
reports
that
Based
upon
the
current
research
and
data
available,
these
laws
showed
added
safety
benefits
for
bicyclists
in
States
where
they
were
evaluated,
and
may
positively
af fect
the
environment,
traf fic,
and
transportation.
NHTSA ’ s
analysis
should
be
telling
in
the
conversation
about
whether
Maine
should
adopt
this
policy .

The
BCM
does
recommend
that
the
proposed
law
be
somewhat
more
limited
than
it
is
as
currently
written.
W e
recommend
that
the
bill
be
amended
so
as
to
remove
Section
2,
which
permits
bicycles
to
treat
red
(stop)
lights
as
yields
after
a
stop.
The
resulting
bill
would
only
permit
bicycle
riders
to
treat
a
stop
sign
as
a
yield.
This
is
consistent
with
Delaware
law ,
which
has
documented
safety
benefits
to
the
policy .
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.

Bicyclist “Stop -As-Yield ” Laws and Safety Fact Sheet  
 
 
Background 
Fatalities  in traffic crashes  involving bicyclists and other cyclists continue to rise. From 2011 to  2020, bicyclist 
and other cyclist fatalities increased by 38% from 682 in 2011 to 938  in 2020 (Stewart, 2022) . In 2020, 26% of 
bicyclist  and other cyclist fatalities occurred at intersections, which  are extremely hazardous for bi cyclists and 
present a high risk for crashes where bicyclists cross paths with motorists ( NHTSA, 2022).  
Bicyclin g has increased in popularity across the United States and provides many environmental, economic, 
and health benefits. Further, people in low-income, marginalized communities and communities of color may  
rely on biking as their primary m ode of transportation. A safe transportation system makes people the priority  
and is designed to accommodate the mistakes people make. This approach requires all road users to  work 
together usi ng all available tools to  help achieve zero  injuries  and fatalitie s on our N ation’s roadways . The 
ultimate goal is a transportation system that allows all people to get to their destination s safely.   
Communities across the United States have been exploring ways to increase bi cyclist safety and reduce 
confusion in potential ly hazardous and high-risk situations. Many States have enacted bicycle safety laws to 
enhance safety and protect all road users. For example, bicyclist s top-as-yield  laws allow bi cyclists to treat 
stop signs as yield signs and /or red -light signal s as stop sign s. The se laws allow bi cyclists to mitigate risk to 
their advantage. “Stopping discourages bicycling, substantially increasing time, energy expenditure, 
discomfort, risk of collisions, and risk for strain and overuse injuries” (Tekle, 2017) . 
In 1982, Idaho was the first S tate to pass such a law , commonly known as the “Idaho Stop Law.” Th e law 
allow s bicyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed when safe, rather than come to a compl ete stop. After Idaho 
adopted the law, bicyclist injuries  from traffic crashes declined by 14.5% the following year  (Meggs, 2010). In 
2017, Delaware adopted a similar , limited stop -as-yield law, known 
as the "Delaware Yield.” Traffic c rashes involving bicyclists at stop 
sign intersections fell by 23% in the 30 months after the law’s 
passage,  compared to the previous 30 months. Eight States (Arkansas, 
Delaware, Idaho, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, and 
Washington) have si milar laws. Colorado passed a law in 2018 that 
allowed local municipalities to adopt standard language on safe bicycle yielding at stops.  Table  1 shows a summary of State law 
characteristics. These laws do not negate a bicyclist’s responsibility to 
yield to other traffic before crossing an intersection or to follow all work zone traffic rules. State laws vary , so bicyclists must be sure to 
know the laws in their State. 

 
Table 1 . List of States W ith Stop- As-Yield  Law s 
 
Benefits: Safety, Environmental, and Transportation Impact 
The benefits of bicycling extend beyond personal and physical, to environmental benefits that can lead to 
healthier, qui eter, cleaner, and safer streets.  Fewer motor vehicles on the road equate to less congestion and 
lower emission outputs.  
Bicyclist stop- as-yield  laws allow cyclists to mitigate risk to their advantage, increase their visibility to drivers 
and reduce exposure. Bicyclists have greater incentive to yield , as they are at high risk for injury at 
intersections. One study cites research showing that pedestrians and bicyclists exert more care and attention 
before crossing red signals than green (Leth et al. , 2014). A naturalistic study of bicyclists in Florida’s Tampa 
Bay area found that bicyclists highly complied with general 
traffic rules  (88.1% in the daytime, 87.5% at night). In 
contrast, drivers were most ly noncompliant with the law on 
yielding to bicyclists’ right-of- way (Lin et al. , 2017). 
Additionally , there is no evidence showing bicyclist stop -as-
yield  laws  have increased bike conflicts with other bikes or 
pedestrians.  Roadway collisions between bi cycli sts with 
other cyclists or pedestrians are uncommon, as found in an Australian study  (O'Hern & Oxley, 2019). When bicyclists 
can maintain a safe but precautionary momentum through an 
intersection, it allows continuous traffic flow.  
Finally, bicyclist stop- as-yield  laws decriminalize a riding behavior , possibly  encourag ing more ridership. 
More bicyclists on the roadway traveling together increase s their visibility and attention by motorists, a 
concept referred to as “Safety in N umbers” (SIN). Studies of SIN show motorists drive more cautiously, and 
bicyclists are safer on roads when traveling with a higher volume of bicyclists. Research by Meggs (2010) suggests that removing stops may reduce injury  risk by half through SIN alone.  
Summary  
A safe transportation system makes people the priority . Working together to enhance bicycle  safety by 
preventing and eliminating crashes that lead  to serious injuries and fatalities  is more important now than ever. 
Many States have enacted b icyclist stop- as-yield  laws to enhance safety and protect cyclists. Based upon the 
current research and data available , these laws show ed added safety benefits for bicyclists  in States where they 
were evaluated, and  may positively affe ct the environment, traffic, and transportation.

Testimony on LD 1551 Ought to Pass with Amendment 
An Act to Increase Bicycle Safety by Allowing Cyclists
 to Treat Stop Signs as Yield Signs and Red Lights as Stop Signs
Greeting distinguished members of the Committee on Transportation: 
My name is James Tassé and I submit this testimony on behalf of the Bicycle 
Coalition of Maine (BCM). The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide 
organization that advocates for bicyclists and pedestrians, and to protect the safety 
and rights of vulnerable users of the public ways. 
The Coalition supports LD 1551, with an amendment to remove Section 2, the "treat 
red lights as stop signs" provision. This would limit bicycles to only treating stop 
signs as yield signs, and would align the bill with policy that has been found to result 
in meaningful reductions in bicycle crashes. 
Laws permitting bicycle rides to treat stop signs as yield signs date back to 1982, 
when Idaho first adopted the policy. Crash rates for bicycle riders fell, and other states
began to implement similar laws. A 2022 National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) resource (atttached to this testimony) notes that in 2017,
Delaware adopted a similar, limited stop-as-yield law, known as the "Delaware 
Yield.” Traffic crashes involving bicyclists at stop sign intersections fell by 23% in 
the 30 months after the law’s passage, compared to the previous 30 months.
Currently, eight states in the United States have similar laws, and the 2022 NHTSA 
resource reports that 
Based upon the current research and data available, these laws showed added safety 
benefits for bicyclists in States where they were evaluated, and may positively affect 
the environment, traffic, and transportation.
NHTSA’s analysis should be telling in the conversation about whether Maine should 
adopt this policy.  
The BCM does recommend that the proposed law be somewhat more limited than it is
as currently written. We recommend that the bill be amended so as to remove Section 
2, which permits bicycles to treat red (stop) lights as yields after a stop. The resulting 
bill would only permit bicycle riders to treat a stop sign as a yield. This is consistent 
with Delaware law, which has documented safety benefits to the policy. 
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
