Re: L.D. 1383, An Act to Regulate Insurance Carrier Prior Authorization 
Requirements for Physical and Occupational Therapy Services  
Dear Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and Members of the Committee:  
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1383.  The purpose of this letter is to 
provide you with background information.  
Currently, a prior authorization must be answered within 72 hours or two business days, whichever is less, except for a requ est in exigent circumstances.  This requirement applies both 
to prescription drugs
1 and non- emergency services.2  This bill would require carriers to respond 
to requests for prior authorization responses for physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
chiropractic services, and physical medicine or rehabilitative services for chronic pain patients 
within 24- hours.  This is the same time period that current law requires for responses to prior 
authorizations where exigent circumstances exist.  
A prior authorization denial is an “adverse health care treatment decision”3  and, accordingly, is 
already subject to the appeals process set forth in the HPIA and Rule 850.  Therefore, in our 
opinion, the section of the bill on appeal rights is not necessary.  
Current law  provides that when a prior authorization is granted, a carrier may not retrospectively 
deny coverage or payment for the originally approved service unless fraudulent or materially 
incorrect information was provided at the time prior approval was granted.4  As written, 
proposed section 4303 -A(5) could be read as allowing carriers to do a retrospective medical 
necessity review even when the prior authorization has been granted.  This would therefore 
conflict with existing law.  
 
1 24-A M.R.S. § 4311(1 -A)(B) requires a carrier to have a process for expedited review of prescription drugs if the 
enrollee is suffering from a health condition that may seriously jeopardize the enrollee’s life, health, or ability to 
regain maximum function or when an en rollee is undergoing a current course of treatment. When an expedited 
review has been requested, the carrier must make a decision within 24 hours of the request.  
2 Rule 850 (8)(E)(3). 
3 24-A M.R.S.§ 4301- A(1).  
4 24-A M.R.S. § 4304(4).

The bill also does not define  the term “physical medicine” used in proposed § 4303- A(2).  
This term does not appear anywhere in Title 24 -A, and in Title 32 only in the context of 
naturopathic physical medicine.5  If the Committee wishes to vote this bill ought to pass, 
we suggest ins erting a definition that clarifies the bill’s intent.  
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide 
any further assistance.  
Sincerely,  
 
Timothy N. Schott
