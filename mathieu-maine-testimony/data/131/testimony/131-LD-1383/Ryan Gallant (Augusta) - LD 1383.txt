LD 1383
Members of the Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services committee,  I am 
writing in favor of LD 1383.  My name is Ryan Gallant and I own three Pediatric 
Therapy clinics in Maine serving over 1000 families.  The recent increase in requests 
for prior authorizations and the decreased number of visits has greatly increased 
administrative burden and interfered with patient care.  Our team of therapists have to 
be taken away from providing services to children in order to request additional visits 
and do peer:peer sessions with insurance companies in order to assist children with 
getting needed services.  Our administrative staff also have to spend additional time 
on making sure that all documentation is repeatedly sent to insurance companies to 
make sure services for these children does not get interrupted.  At our agency we are 
considering hiring someone just to assist with managing these prior authorizations, as 
they have become increasingly burdensome.  This is only adding to the additional 
costs of providing much needed services to children and families in Maine.  Thank 
you for assisting us provide a better service for all and preventing interruptions in 
needed treatment.
