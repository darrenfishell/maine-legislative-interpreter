Testimony of Senator Stacy Brenner introducing LD 1383, “An Act to Regulate Insurance Carrier 
Prior Authorization Requirements for Physical and Occupational Therapy Services ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
April 13, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Distinguished Colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, my name is Stacy Brenner. I 
represent Senate District 30, which includes all of Gorham and most of Scarborough. I am pleased 
to introduce LD 1383, “An Act to Regulate Insurance Carrier Prior Authorization Requirements for 
Physical and Occupational Therapy Services. ” This legislation will address the growing problems 
rehab providers are having in Maine and nationwide with insurance carriers ’ use of administratively 
burdensome and clinically umiecessary prior authorization. 
Carriers will tell you that they require prior authorization to ensure that the services provided are 
medically necessary. For physical and occupational therapy services, the “medical necessity ” 
review is done on an online platform using an artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm that arbitrarily 
approves only a small number of visits without regard to the patient’s diagnosis, comorbidities or 
the number of visits required by the treatment plan. This is not a medical necessity review.“ 
These algorithms are widely known to be arbitrary and capricious. They are built to approve a 
smaller number of visits, while requiring more paperwork for each additional request for more 
visits. In some cases, the provider and patient become frustrated by this system, to the extent that 
they give up on the plan of care all together. This result can be detrimental — especially to post-op 
patients — resulting in patients needing more expensive treatment interventionsand surgeries later. 
For instance, Anthem’s utilization review entity, “AIM” , now known as “Carelon, ” does not let the 
therapist enter the number of visits needed in the Plan of Care. It routinely approves 4 to 6 visits on 
the ﬁrst request, 2 to 4 visits on the second request and 1 to 2 visits for each request thereafter. The 
ﬁrst 2 requests take about 30 minutes to process, then each subsequent request takes up to an hour. 
These requests take more time when the therapist has to make phone calls, do a peer-to-peer consult 
or when the platform malfunctions, which is a common occurance. This system of prior 
authorization also adds atleast 20% more to the cost of providing care. It is threatening the viability 
of small private practices who have not had an increase in reimbursement in over 15 years. It is also 
the reason new therapy practices are staying out of network entirely. 
Aside from pediatric patients, most patients conclude their Plan of Care within 12 visits, which 
typically consists of 2 to 3 hour-long visits per week for 4 to 6 weeks. This is the number of visits 
that Anthem routinely auto-approves. However, these 12 visits necessitate 3 to 4 prior 
authorizations and 2 to 3 hours of administrative time since Anthem started requiring prior

authorization in 2019. The therapist also has to take 15 to 30 minutes out of the patient’s treatment 
session to take measurements that the platform requires — measurements that are frequently 
irrelevant to any medical necessity decision. Now, 12 visits require 14 to 15 hours of work for the 
provider and 1 to 2 hours less of treatment for the patient. 
Essentially, the carrier is requiring hours of additional work when they automatically and routinely 
approve 8 to 12 visits. LD 1383 will ﬁx this problem by prohibiting prior authorization for the ﬁrst 
12 visits. 
Frequent prior authorization requirements also create interruptions and delays in patient care and 
high levels of uncertainty for providers and patients. Visits are frequently cancelled because of the 
time it takes to submit the request and subsequently receive an answer. Patients never know from 
one week to the next whether they are able to carry out their plan of care or if their plan will be 
intemipted by inappropriate denials - necessitating appeals that cause more administrative burdens 
and treatment delays. 
ln April 2022, the Ofﬁce of the Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services published a report on the use of prior authorization by Medicare Advantage 
Organizations (MAOs). OIG indicated that the use of prior authorization frequently caused delays 
in the beneﬁciary’s access to medically necessary services and denial of payments to providers for 
covered services that should have been paid._ 
LD 1383 would ﬁx the delays and interruptions in care by requiring a 24-hour turnaround for 
requests for additional visits. The Affordable Care Act already requires carriers to answer any 
request to extend a course of treatment that is already in progress, within 24 hours. In addition, the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently published proposed rules for prior 
authorization procedures for Medicare Advantage Plans that will require shorter time frames for 
prior authorization decisions. In Congress, Rep. DelBene of Washington is sponsoring bipartisan 
legislation to further regulate prior authorization, H.R. 31 73, “Improving Seniors’ Timely Access to 
Care Act of 2022, ” which will require real-time decision-making on prior authorization requests. 
This legislation was passed in the House and will be voted on in the Senate, showing support at the 
federal level. Therefore, carriers should be able to meet this requirement of shorter time frames for 
requests when it is already mandated and continues to be further regulated under federal law. 
LD 1383 would also require carriers to approve a minimum of 6 visits at a time when a patient 
needs more than‘l2 visits, rather than only 1 to 2. When only 1-2 visits at a time are approved, the 
cost to provide the care almost doubles and the patient’s improvement is too small to be measurable.

6 visits allows enough time and treatment for the patient to make measurable improvement, which 
carriers require in order to justify the medical necessity of ongoing care. 
To address the needs of chronic pain patients who routinely need more care, this bill prohibits 
requiring prior authorization for therapy services for the ﬁrst 90 days of treatment. This ensures that 
chronic pain patients have adequate access to conservative, non-pharmacologic treatment without 
ongoing interruptions in their care by unnecessary prior authorization. This should not be 
misinterpreted to mean that every patient with chronic pain automatically gets 90 days of therapy 
whether they need it or not. 
It is important to note that this bill doesn’t entitle patients to services or a providers to pay for 
services that are not medically necessary. Carriers always have the right to review medical records 
for medical necessity before paying a claim. They can also retroactively reimburse money for 
claims that were not medically necessary on a post-service review. In these cases, Maine law 
requires that the patient be held harmless from having to pay the claims. The intention of this 
legislation is not to encourage therapists to provide services that are not medically necessary. If they 
do, they risk not being paid. 
We welcome the opportunity to work with interested parties on this bill to make sure it addresses 
the needs of patients and providers without interfering with the carriers ’ use of reasonableA 
utilization review procedureswhere they are necessary.T
