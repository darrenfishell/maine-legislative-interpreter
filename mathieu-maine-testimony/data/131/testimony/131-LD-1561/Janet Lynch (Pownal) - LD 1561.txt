LD 1561
I am very concerned about LD 1561, “ An Act to Restore Firearm Rights and Hunting
Privileges to Persons Previously Convicted of Certain Nonviolent Felony Crimes.” I 
note that the recent mass shootings in Bowdoin and Yarmouth were carried out by an 
individual who had recently been released from prison, and who had a history of 
violence. Perhaps I am missing something, but I do not see an exemption for those 
convicted of domestic violence for example, or those under restraining orders. 
Generally, I am concerned that the definition of “Certain Nonviolent Felony Crimes” 
may not be specific enough to prevent guns from getting into the hands of those with 
a proven history of violence and a willingness to use them for violent ends. The 
committee must carefully weigh the dangerous potential for deadly harm to the public
when allowing previously convicted felons to own guns, and should seek more 
information about which kinds of felonies may be here exempted. I do not believe this
bill should pass.
