LD 1561
I'm writing in support of LD 1561, "An Act to Restore Firearm Rights and Hunting 
Privileges to Persons Previously Convicted of Certain Nonviolent Felony Crimes." 
I have read this bill in its entirety and I'm in full support. I urge the committee to vote 
"Ought to Pass" on LD 1561.
Sincerely, James M Waite
