Memorandum of Support

To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1561 An Act to Restore Firearm Rights and Hunting Privileges to Persons Previously Convicted of 
Certain Nonviolent Felony Crimes 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1561 An Act to Restore Firearm Rights and 
Hunting Privileges to Persons Previously Convicted of Certain Nonviolent Felony Crimes 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
This bill simply affirms the Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This is a step in the right direction 
for those that have paid their debt to society. Even Felons can vote in Maine because it is considered a basic 
right. This bill has strict guidelines for restoration of rights along with a 10 year waiting period. Should a old man 
or woman not be able to defend themselves for something they did decades ago? Felonies originally were 
limited to the most heinous of crimes, but now extend to non violent offenses. While I don't see that status going 
away anytime soon, the injustice of not having your Constitutionally protected right is a crime in itself.  
 
 
Please support Mainer's Constitutional Rights, by supporting this bill.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
