LD 1561
Honorable committee members, 
I strongly believe that LD 1561 ought to pass. Nonviolent felons who have been 
released from the penal system, and honored and fulfilled their probation/parole 
requirements, have done what is required to pay their so-called debt to society. Either 
they're fit to be out in the world and treated like every other person, or they're not. 
Since they have fulfilled their requirements to the extent asked of them by the legal 
system, I see no reason they shouldn't be able to exercise their rights to firearms 
ownership and their right to hunt for food or sport.
LD 1561 ought to pass!
Thank you
 
Thank you!
