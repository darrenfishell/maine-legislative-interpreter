In Support For 
LD 1669- An Act to Require That Copies of Deeds and Survey Plans Be Provided to Municipal Assessors 
April 28, 2023 
 
Sen. Nangle, Rep. Stover, and distinguished members of the State and Local Government 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am submitting testimony in support for LD 1699, An Act 
to Require That Copies of Deeds and Survey Plans Be Provided to Municipal Assessors, on behalf of the 
Maine Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the 
Legislature. The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC), who are elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maine’s 
35 Senate districts. 
Officials believe this may be redundant as they have access to the deed registry now, and some 
but not all survey plans are registered with the deed registry. As these are proprietary documents that are 
paid for by the party that has requested the survey, they have the option of not registering the plan if there 
isn’t a municipally qualifying reason such as a subdivision request or development in process. However, 
officials agree that having a surveyor copy in the town office would be extremely helpful for also 
adequate evaluation. There have been instances where individuals have been assessed based on historical 
knowledge of the size of the parcel that had been changed resulting in what should have been a lower 
assessment.  
Officials feel that generally such information will be beneficial to live in the parcel file for all 
parties in the long run. To that end, municipal officials support the goals of LD 1669.
