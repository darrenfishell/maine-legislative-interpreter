Testimony of the Maine Registers of Deeds Association  
 
Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1669, An Act To Require That Copies of Deeds and Survey Plans Be Provided to Municipal Assessors 
April 20, 2023 
 
Representative Zeigler and Honorable Members of the Committee on State and Local Government,  
My name is Cherri Crockett. I am the Registrar of Deeds for Oxford County and the President of the 
Maine Registers of Deeds Association.  
I am speaking today in regard to LD 1669, which states, “a grantee in a deed shall provide a copy of the 
deed to the municipal assessor of the municipality in which the real estate is located.”  
 
Currently, per State Statute, under Title 33, Section 663, all registry offices provide copies of recorded 
deeds to each municipality in our jurisdiction, as well as those of the unorganized territories to the State 
Property Division. This is done monthly.  
Each Registrar also assumes the responsibility of polling their municipalities for any additional 
documentation they prefer to receive. 
Survey plans are not currently required by State Statute to be recorded with the Registry of Deeds, but 
are available for the public to access, either digitally or in paper form for a current fee of $5 each.  
The Registers of Deeds Association respectfully submits this testimony as supporting documentation 
that we abide by current State Statute to provide municipalities all recorded deeds of property.  
If there are any questions, please feel free to contact myself, Cherri Crockett, 207.743.6211 x1401 or 
Jessica Spaulding, Cumberland County Registrar, 207.871.8399.
