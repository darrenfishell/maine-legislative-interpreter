Testimony neither for nor against LD 1631, “ An Act to Establish the Gas Tax Fairness Credit .” 
May 9, 2023  
James Myall, Economic Policy Analyst  
 
Dear Senator Grohoski , Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation. My name is James Myall, and I’m an economic policy analyst at the Maine Center for Economic 
Policy. I’m writing to you with testimony neither for nor against LD 1631, “An Act to Establish the Gas 
Tax Fairness Credit.”  
 
Many Mainers, especially those with  low income , are st ruggling  to make ends meet  particularly  in the 
face of rising costs b rought on by inflation. A little  more than one in three Maine adul ts current ly says 
they find it “somewhat ” or “very ” difficult to meet  their usual household expenses each week.1  While  
LD 1631 would provide assistance to Mainers with low income who are most impacted by the cost of 
gas, it would be best paired with an increase in the state’s gasoline excise tax. By pairing an i ncrease to 
the gas tax with a new gas tax fairness credit, the legislature could ensure that households with low 
income save money, while asking households with higher income , trucking companies , and tourists to 
pay more to ensure that our roads and bridges are adequately maintained.  
 
The Governor’s biennial budget proposed transferring $200 million from the general fund to the 
highway fund to help fill the structural gap in the highway fund which  has been partly caused by the 
legislature’s decision to uncouple the gas tax from the rate of inflation in 2011. Before this decoupling, 
the gas tax was set to increase by a small amount each year to keep pace with the cost of living. That 
decision has co st the highway fund $381 million in fiscal years 2012 through 2023.2 If the indexing 
provision had been left in place, the gas tax would be 41.2 cents per gallon in 2023 and 42.1 cents per 
gallon in 2024 (instead of the 30 cents per gallon it is today). If the legislature were to raise the current 
gas tax to this amount, MECEP estimates it would raise $197 million  in additional revenue for the 
highway fund3 – freeing up the general fund allocation in the budget to be spent on the other pressing 
needs faci ng this committee, whether that be housing, health care, or education.   
 
Pairing LD 1631 with an increase to the gas tax of this size would allow the legislature to raise this 
revenue while offsetting the impact on  households with  low income . For example, a typical American 
household bought just over 700 gallons of gas in 2021.4 Increasing the state gas tax by 12 cents per 
gallon would cost Maine households an additional $84 per year, on average. With a gas tax fairness 
credit of between $125 a nd $225 per household, as outlined in LD 1631, the families with the lowest  
income would still see a net decrease in their annual tax liability , meaning that the cost of the new tax 
would fall on those more able to pay it.  
 
I also want to note that the gas tax is one of Maine’s more exportable taxes. Approximately 20 percent 
of the gas tax revenues each year come from diesel taxes and road use fees in lieu of taxes paid by 
interstate trucking companies.5 This portion is larg ely paid by l arge freight companies. Each year, 
between another 20 and 25 percent of the revenues come from out -of-state visitors .6 Since trucking 
companies and tourists both use our roads and cause wear and tear on them, it’s only fair that they 
should c ontribute to their upkeep. And the gas tax remains the best way to do so while reducing some 
of the cost that residents have to pay. LD 1631 would make that even more true by providing a credit to 
the most vulnerable Maine residents, and it’s an opportunit y to ask wealthier Mainers and the many 
visitors to our state to pay a little more.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I’m happy to answer any questions, and I can be reached at
