I'm writing in support of naming Exit 45 of the Maine Turnpike approach to South 
Portland Samantha Smith Way. 
I doubt that you need any introduction to the special significance of Samantha in 
Maine history, but it is far more than is usually thought or taught.
My organization, Americans Who Tell the Truth, bases its education program for 
middle school students around the state on Samantha, what we call the Samantha 
Smith Challenge.
https://americanswhotellthetruth.org/programs/education/samantha-smith-challenge/  
We challenge students to act for the common good with Samantha as a model --- 
choosing an issue they are passionate about, or anxious about, researching it, 
engaging with organizations already working on it, and making a difference, 
becoming spokespeople for the issue.
Samantha's trajectory from anxiety about nuclear war to teaching adults how to think 
about making peace is the trajectory we want our students to model their citizenship 
on. She taught us all a lesson we need to be taught again & again --- how easily and 
dangerously we dehumanize others when we are encouraged to fear them and see 
them as less than human, and then how easily that fear can be dispelled by sanity and 
courage --- even that of an eleven year old.
We can't remind children and adults too often of the necessity of courage and 
compassion in solving our urgent problems. And honoring Samantha is a perfect way 
to do it.
Sincerely,
Robert Shetterly
