Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, my name is Eric Herter, and I am here today to testify in favor of 
LD 21. It is highly appropriate, at this moment of intense hostility between Russia and the United 
States, and when threat of nuclear war is higher than any time since the 1962 Cuban missile 
crisis, that we honor the memory of Maine's brave daughter, Samantha Smith. 
Aged ten in 1982, she wrote Soviet leader Yuri Andropov telling of her concern about possible 
nuclear war, and asking whether his country sought war or peace. His three-page response 
stressed Russia's desire for peace, and invited Samantha to come see for herself. Thus, in mid- 
1983, at a moment of high tension between Russia and the US, 1 1-year-old Samantha visited 
Russia for two weeks with her parents, receiving much publicity as a cheerful and kindhearted 
ambassador for peace. 
We need such an ambassador today! 
(A personal note: the memory of Samantha Smith may have been whispering in our ears when 
my wife and I named our Ô¨Årst-born "Samantha.") 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, 
Eric Heiter
