Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, my name is Douglas Rawlings, President of the Maine Chapter of 
Veterans for Peace, I would like to add my voice to my fellow Mainers who are advocating for a 
roadway to be named after Maine's own Samantha Smith. Not only is this an honor well-
deserved for a family that has seen their loved one taken from them at an early age; it is also a 
testament to the power of young people's voices. In this day and age of "generation gaps," 
wouldn't it be wonderful if people of my generation (I am a so-called "boomer") could align with 
younger people ("Generation Z") to celebrate the life of a true peace activist? As a teacher of 
Peace Studies at the University of Maine at Farmington, I have witnessed young people's 
eagerness to engage in conversations that are not rife with rancor as a means to advance the 
cause of peace. What better way to do this than to acknowledge the power of Samantha Smith's 
example?
Another benefit to having the Samantha Smith Way in place would be to send a strong signal to 
the thousands of visitors our great state welcomes each year. Imagine a family visiting from, say, 
Iowa, when, upon seeing this sign with a girl's name on it, asking: "Who's she?" Ah, then the 
conversation begins as all on board start doing their research. What a gift to give from our state 
to theirs. Finally, I have to say as a veteran who has been to war it would be a real honor to have 
our state establish a "peace memorial" to recognize one of our own as opposed to another war 
memorial. Once again, Maine could lead the way. Dirigo! 
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Doug Rawlings
VFP Maine Chapter President
