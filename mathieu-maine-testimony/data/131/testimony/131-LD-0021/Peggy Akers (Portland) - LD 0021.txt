Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, my name is Peggy Akers, and I am a member of Veterans for 
Peace. Thank you for the opportunity to share my wholehearted support for naming Exit 45 in 
South Portland…the Samantha Smith Way.
Samantha Smith left us with a gift of teaching our children the cost of any war. Imagine driving 
off that exit and sharing the story of this brave young girl with our children, our grandchildren, 
and all who honor a world beyond war.
As a Vietnam veteran and a nurse at Seeds of Peace Camp for many years, I had the privilege of 
meeting so many young people from all over this country and the world who only yearned for a 
more peaceful world. There is a plaque and story about this young girl, Samantha Smith, on a 
trail at the Seeds of Peace Camp in Otisfield. We always stop and read this brave young girl’s 
story and feel empowered to change the world we live in now. Her story and her life should 
never be forgotten, and this is a special way to keep it alive.
Many thanks for your time. 
Sincerely,
Peggy Akers
