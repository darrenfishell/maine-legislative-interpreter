Regrettably, Samantha Smith will always be remembered as a bold thirteen year old 
girl with a great concern for the world around her. 
As a peace activist her leadership can inspire young people to pursue communication 
and conflict resolution in their future lives and careers. 
We should promote such goals by empowering such a message; it should be 
remembered and shared.
The renaming of exit 45, the “Maine Turnpike Approach” in South Portland, to 
“Samantha Smith Way” would be a suitable effort toward that end.
Thanks for your support,
