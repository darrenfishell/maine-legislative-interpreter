Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury , and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety : 
 
My name is Sam Hurley , and I am the Director of Maine Emergency Medical Services, Maine 
EMS, within the Department of Public Safety.  I am submitting written tes timony  on behalf of 
Maine Department of Public Safety and Maine EMS  in support  of LD  1119, An Act to Clarify the 
Criminal Statutes with Regard to Assaults on Emergency Medical Services Persons.  
 
While Maine EMS does not currently collect data regarding assaults on EMS clinicians in the 
State of Maine, there is a significant body of research that highlights the increased risk of 
violence for EMS clinicians practicing within the field. In a recent systematic literature review by Maguire et al., there are numerous studies from around the world that indicate that EMS

 underreporting of violence against EMS clinicians based on multiple data sources.2 The same 
paper found that:  
 
The rate of assault cases resulting in lost workdays for  EMS personnel  in the United 
States is 56.5 per  10,000  full time workers per year, a rate about 23 times higher than the 
national  average of 2.6 for all occupations3 and about seven times higher than the rate of 
9.1 for health care providers4 (p. 174). 
 
Maine EMS would encourage the Committee to support this bill that clarifies the language 
regarding assaults on EMS clinicians in the State of Maine.  Feel free to reach out to me anytime 
if there is any additional information that  I can offer the Committee .
