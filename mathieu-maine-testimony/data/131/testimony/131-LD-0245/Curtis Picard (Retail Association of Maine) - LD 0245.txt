RE: Testimony  in SUPPORT  of LD 245, An Act to Require a Person Receiving Unemp loyment 
Benefits to Att end Scheduled Interviews to Fulfill the Work Searc h Requirement  
Dear Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder  and members of the Labor and Housing  
Committee : 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I 
am a resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and represent retailers 
of all sizes.  Maineâ€™s retailers employ more than 80,000 Mainers.  I am submitting the testimony 
in support of LD 245 . 
 
We appreciate this issue being raised. We hear from employers about empl oyee candidates not 
showing up for job interviews . We also hear stories of employees simply not showing  up for 
work ev en after they have been offered employment, accepted the offer, and s cheduled for 
work. Most employers you talk to have some stories to share about employees or candidates 
ghosting them with no explanation. It is hard to understand why someone would  not show up 
for an interview without some sort of call, t ext or other reason , but it do es happen .  
 
We underst and that what LD 245 is proposing may already exist on the Maine Department of 
Labor website. However, we believe that most empl oyers are not aware that a reporting po rtal 
exists, and we would be happ y to help promote it to our membership. We would also ask the 
Department to increase the market ing of it to emplo yers.  
 
We hope that this bill spurs a conve rsation on no shows, and that the committee can provide 
input to help i mprove the current s ystem . 
 
Thank you for the consideration of our comments . 
 
Curtis Picard, CAE  
President and CEO
