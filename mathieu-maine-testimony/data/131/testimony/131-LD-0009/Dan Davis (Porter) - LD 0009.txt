LD 9
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the ENR Committee:
I represent no entity or agency and am opposed to LD9.
This should not be moved forward as it continues to delegate more state 
responsibilities down to the local level, where there are already insufficient resources,
tax-base, labor to administer and evaluate these large-scale impacts.
It appears to be approving of a reckless 'rubber-stamp' bill that imposes an unfunded 
mandate on municipal governments.
If the State is relinquishing power back to Home Rule authority, than that language 
should accompany the language in this bill, to describe what is being put back under 
local control so Town's know what is expected of them and what they are empowered 
to do, and so that it can be codified in law as well.
We either care about due diligence and caring about the environment and long-term 
impacts, or we don't. Not restoring Home Rule power while diluting State oversight 
shows an indifference to both.
I urge the committee to oppose LD9 as written.
Thank you.
