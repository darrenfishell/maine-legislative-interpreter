Testimony in Support of LD 9 (“An Act to Establish Processing Time Limits for Permit by Rule Applications Under the Site Location of Development Laws”) J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS® January 30, 2023 Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, my name is Andy Cashman.  I am the Founder of Resolve Government Relations, and I am here on behalf of my client, the Maine Association of REALTORS®, which is a professional trade association with over 6,200 members statewide. Our members represent both buyers and sellers and are involved in both residential and commercial real estate transactions. Our membership also includes affiliates, which are those professionals involved in real estate transactions, such as bankers, closing agents, title agents, appraisers, building inspectors, surveyors, etc. The Maine Association is a chartered member of the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) which is the largest trade association in the country.  The Maine Association of REALTORS® supports LD 9 because it could encourage the development of housing in our state.  The passage of this bill could allow more streamlined processing of certain housing developments. This change could help address the fundamental cause of the affordable housing problem: a lack of supply. We simply do not have enough homes in Maine and need to build more. This bill provides for proper environmental protection while potentially streamlining permitting for certain housing developments.   We respectfully urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 9. Thank you for your time and consideration.
