John Mills
Holden
LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee.
My name is John Mills and I live in Holden, Maine.
I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1614 - An Act to Require an 
Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion.
The decision as to whether or not to end the life of an unborn child through an 
elective abortion is the most difficult and important decision that any pregnant woman
has to make.  It has life changing consequences for all involved.  That is an 
understatement. 
I believe that the gravity of this decision requires that the pregnant woman seeking an 
abortion be provided with as much information as possible and time to process that 
information.
LD 1614 will require that an ultrasound be done so the mother can see her unborn 
child in real time so she can appreciate the humanity of  her child.
This bill will require that the woman be informed of the abortion procedure and its 
risks to her health.
The woman will be informed of other options including parenting and adoption.
The woman will be told about the community resources available to her.
A minimum of 48 hours will be given to the woman to consider this decision.
An informed decision is the best decision.
Because of the above reasons I ask that each of you vote Ought to Pass on LD 1614.
Thank you.
