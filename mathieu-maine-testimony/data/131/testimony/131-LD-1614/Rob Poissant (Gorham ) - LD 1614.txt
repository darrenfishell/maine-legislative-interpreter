LD 1614
Hello, my name is Rob Poissant. I reside in the town of Gorham .
I support and urge your support for LD 1614 - An Act to Require an Ultrasound and 
Certain Counseling Before an abortion.
A woman who is pregnant must have the right to access the information which 
includes medical information about the Abortion procedure and the access to the 
viewing of an ultrasound , so she can make a fully informed choice. An ultrasound 
would allow accurate information to promote a womanâ€™s physical and psychological 
health.
One example of the necessity of an ultrasound is an ectopic pregnancy problem .
Please allow women the opportunity to have the vital information they need with 
viewing an ultrasound so they can make a fully informed decision.
Thank you
