LD 1614
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee
Thank you for the opportunity to express my support for LD 1614.
Which of the following would you not want for your own daughter or loved one were 
she to consider an abortion?
Information on the procedure and risks.
Alternatives options including parenting and adoption.
Information on supportive community resources.
An ultrasound, which would be observed by the patient.
A minimum of 48 hours to make an informed decision.
All information to be documented and signed by the patient.
All the above sound very practical to me and I urge you to support LD 1614 by voting
"ought to pass".
Thank you for reading my testimony on LD 1614.
