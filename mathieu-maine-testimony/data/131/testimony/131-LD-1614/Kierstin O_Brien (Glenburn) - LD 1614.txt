Glenburn
LD 1614
Honorable members of the judiciary committee,
My name is Kierstin O’Brien of Glenburn, ME and I would like to testify in favor of 
the bills presented today that would improve women’s rights and healthcare as it 
corresponds to pregnancy. After listening to hours of testimonies on May 1st, 2023 of 
women who deeply regretted their abortions and wished they had had better 
counseling to prepare them for what they were about to do. I believe wholeheartedly 
that bills like LD 1614, LD 494, LD 771, LD 1249, and LD 1197 are critically 
necessary to provide adequate healthcare for those who find themselves in crisis 
pregnancies so that they can make the best and more well informed decisions for their
health and wellness.
Let me leave you with this:  In the hours of testimonies you have and will hear 
regarding this issue of abortion and how it should be legislated for the people you 
serve, how many of those testimonies were from those who regretting choosing life?  
Thank you for your time.
