Janet LeBlanc
Waterville
LD 1614
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am testifying in support of LD 1614.
LD 1614  provides for women to make a more information life-changing decisions. 
Under LD 1614 the patient is given an ultrasound which will be observed by the 
patient.  An ultrasound allows the patient to be better informed of the procedures and 
risks of an abortion.  This bill requires patient to be provided information of 
alternative options including adoption and parenting.  These are options someone who
is scared may not know where to find this information.  The patient may not be aware 
of  supportive community resources exist or how to find them â€“ this bill requires the 
patient to told.  Then the patient is given at least 48 hours to consider the new 
information and to connect whit her support system.  This bill should become law 
because it helps the patient to make a better informed decision.
