Kelly Coffin
Clinton
LD 1614
 Honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, My name is Kelly Coffin from 
Clintiom.Please vote ought to pass LD 1614,HP1039.
This is a common sense protection to make sure a woman is getting complete 
informed consent. 
I have heard that abortion facilities do not have to receive inspections .  If this is true 
that should be addressed as well. Could we possibly be stricter with restaurants than 
places doing actual medical procedures??  Thank you , for the women.
