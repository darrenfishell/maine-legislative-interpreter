LD 1614
As a RN I have worked with a number of young women over the years who chose 
abortion because their understanding was that it was not a “life” they were aborting, 
just a “mass of tissue”. Many did not believe the unborn’s heart began to beat by 8 
weeks and the brain fully develops in the 2nd trimester with most neurons present in 
the central nervous system - hence, that unborn child can feel pain. 
There is so much more I could add but the bottom line is that if one is willing to 
inflict pain on an innocent human being and simultaneously extinguish his/her life, 
then it should be a truly informed decision. 
Fortunately some of these women reconsidered their decision and chose life after 
having an ultrasound. Unfortunately many were not given that opportunity and while 
some just do not care, some have been scarred as a result, especially after starting 
their families and having routine ultrasounds during their pregnancies which they 
found to be eye-opening.
An ultrasound is a simple, inexpensive, non-invasive procedure. It should be required 
before an abortion along with proper, transparent counseling. Please vote “YES” for 
LD1614.
Along that line, since a woman may change her mind about having an abortion after 
receiving education, counseling &/or ultrasound, she has a right to withdraw her 
consent and it is criminal not to allow it. Please vote “Yes” for LD 771.
Please vote “Yes” for LD 1197
