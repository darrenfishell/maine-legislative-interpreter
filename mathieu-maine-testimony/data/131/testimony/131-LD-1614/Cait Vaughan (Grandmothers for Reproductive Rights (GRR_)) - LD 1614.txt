Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan
and
I
am
a
staf f
member
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
I’m
testifying
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
1614:
An
Act
to
Requir e
an
Ultrasound
and
Certain
Counseling
Befor e
an
Abortion.
Abortion
care
is
built
around
facilitating
agency
and
informed
decision-making
for
patients.
In
current
practice
within
publicly
available
abortion
clinics
in
Maine,
ultrasounds
are
given
at
the
discretion
of
the
provider ,
a
licensed
medical
professional.
Providers
consult
with
patients
before
ultrasounds
regarding
what
information
they
would
like
to
have
shared
with
them.
This
allows
the
patient
to
experience
their
medical
care
as
self-determined
and
humane.
Medical
providers
should
be
working
in
partnership
with
patients
to
determine
what
is
medically
necessary
and
best
for
that
individual
patient.
LD
1614
ignores
the
thoughtful
protocols
and
practices
currently
in
place,
and
injects
anti-abortion
ideology
into
patient
decision-making.
Research
on
mandated
ultrasound
viewing
shows
that
viewing
ultrasound
images
do
not
deter
the
majority
of
patients
who
were
certain
in
their
decision
beforehand,
and
only
impact
the
decision
of
those
with
prior
low
to
medium
certainty
1
.
This
supports
allowing
patients
to
decide
how
much
and
which
information
they
desire
to
know
throughout
this
deeply
personal
process.
Solid
research
reveals
the
harms
of
mandatory
waiting
periods,
and
such
barriers
also
go
against
W orld
Health
Or ganization
recommendations
for
abortion
care
2
.
This
bill
proposes
changes
to
Maine’ s
abortion
laws
that
would
negatively
impact
patients
with
regards
to
a
time-sensitive
and
legal
medical
procedure.
Once
a
pregnant
person
has
decided
to
end
their
pregnancy ,
it
is
their
legal
right
to
do
so
under
Maine
law
and
they
should
not
be
subjected
to
additional
barriers
to
obtain
care.
GRR!s
want
pregnant
Mainers
to
feel
supported
and
safe,
and
LD
1614
instead
proposes
new
barriers
to
basic
health
care.
W e
ur ge
the
committee
to
oppose
LD
1614.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Cait
V aughan
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
