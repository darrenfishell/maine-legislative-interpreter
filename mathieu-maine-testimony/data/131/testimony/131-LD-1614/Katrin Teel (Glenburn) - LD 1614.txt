Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary:  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am writing to testify in support of L.D. 1614, An Act to 
Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion.  
 
Simply put, this bill would provide a woman with more information to make a life-changing 
choice. Informed consent is a right, not a privilege. Letâ€™s empower women to make the best 
decision for themselves. 
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on L.D. 1614. Thank you for allowing 
me to contribute my testimony.
