LD 1614
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1614.
It is 2023 and with the recent Dobbs decision, the issue of abortion is very much up 
for debate across the country. There is no federally recognized right to abortion, as the
Dobbs decision makes it clear that the previous Roe decision was deeply flawed.
There are many reasons why a woman may feel that abortion is the only option. 
Having a child is a major life altering event. The promise of abortion as a way to 
erase a mistake is unfortunately not the same as the reality. Abortion results in the 
death of the fetus. If and when a woman decides that she doesn't want to go through 
with the abortion, up to the point of the death of the fetus, she should have the right to
stop the process.
Just as having a child is a major life altering event, going through with an abortion 
can also result in lifelong regret. In the immediate time after discovery of pregnancy, 
relationship change, or work change, emotions can run high. It is important that 
women are provided time to come to terms with their final decision to go through 
with an abortion or not, that's why a 48 hour waiting period is necessary. 
Just as a woman needs time to make a big decision, she also needs to fully understand
what she has before she decides to give it up. Providing pregnant women with the 
opportunity to view their ultrasound can help them realize the full concept of their 
pregnancy and the risks involved.
Please deem LD 1614 in “Ought To Pass” to ensure that women are provided with the
facts of their pregnancy and the time to make a thoughtful decision.
