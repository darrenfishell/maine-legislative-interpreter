Based on the lies that continue to deny science by pro abortion groups- many are 
coerced into non-thought. Part of that is to remove person hood from the unborn child
growing in the womb. We cannot go and smash eagle eggs, time to mimic those harsh
laws for the offspring of our own species. Allow women the same ability to view their
young just as National Geographic affords the populace to view the wombâ€™s of 
various species. Support this bill. Support your conscience.
