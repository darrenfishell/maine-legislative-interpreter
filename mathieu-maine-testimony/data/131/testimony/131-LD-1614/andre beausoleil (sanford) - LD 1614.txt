LD1614 
I am writing you today in support of LD1614 
Historically again woman have been lied 
to.They are not carrying a clump of cells. They 
should have the opportunity to have an 
ultrasound so they can see the baby that has 
been kicking them, there are organization out 
there that will pay for this and also give them 
help. The democrat party has always said that 
they would like to see abortion be rare and 
safe, itâ€™s time your actions support that. It has 
been proven that when a woman has an 
ultrasound she is less likely to have an abortion 
. I implore you to vote ought to pass onLD1614
