To: The Judiciary Committee 
 
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1614 for these reasons: 
1. This bill will provide a woman with information that is critical to giving her a 
real choice in her health care. 
2. Over half (27) states hold this requirement in their laws. It is a reasonable 
requirement.  
3. Medical facilities should provide a woman with all her options: 
a. Inform the patient of all risks related to the procedure. 
b. Patient should be informed of other options besides abortion. 
c. The patient should be able to view an ultrasound of the child in her 
womb before an abortion. 
d. The patient should be given 48 hours to make an informed decision 
about such a serious procedure. 
 
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD1614!
