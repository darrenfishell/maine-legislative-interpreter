Re: LD 1614 An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion    
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1614.  
This bill imposes medically unnecessary requirements and demeans patients by casting doubt on 
their ability to make informed healthcare decisions. Blanket ultrasound requirements are rooted 
in coercion and anti-abortion stigma, and subordinate medical care of the patient to the religious 
beliefs of others. The individual requirements of this bill amount to deceptive coercion imposing 
a religious agenda while masked as informed consent. These requirements pressure people, 
already in a sensitive and emotional situation, into changing their mind about a difficult decision. 
Such coercion to impose a political position upon people in such a vulnerable position is just 
wrong.  
 
Abortion is a legal procedure. If you want to reduce the number of them, I suggest funding and 
requiring sexuality education and making contraception easily accessible.    
 
But until that day, please preserve reproductive health by rejecting LD 1614. Thank you.  
 
Sincerely, 
-Ray Vensel
