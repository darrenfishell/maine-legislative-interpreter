LD 1614
 I thoroughly support LD 1614, Abigail Griffin's Act to Require an Ultrasound and 
Certain Counseling Before an Abortion. 
I thoroughly support this. I can not say it enough.
 It is a need. 
 It is essential.
 Many girls lives are changed, for the better, when they receive this counseling and 
see an ultrasound of a live baby, their own baby with his own heartbeat. It is  very 
positive  and changes the trajectory of their lives, both mom and baby.
