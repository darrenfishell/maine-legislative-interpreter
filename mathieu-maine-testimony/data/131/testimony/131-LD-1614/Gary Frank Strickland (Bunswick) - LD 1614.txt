Dear Judiciary Committee,
For most surgeries it would be unthinkable to perform them without an MRI or 
ultrasound prior.  There are many reasons you should support this bill and one is for 
the safety of the mother but also to ensure that the mother understands exactly what 
she is doing with her baby.  Pretending babies are "clumps" of cells is deceptive and 
this law will ensure that the mother knows exactly what she is doing.  Please support 
this bill.
Sincerely,
G. Frank & Susan R. Strickland
Brunswick, Maine
