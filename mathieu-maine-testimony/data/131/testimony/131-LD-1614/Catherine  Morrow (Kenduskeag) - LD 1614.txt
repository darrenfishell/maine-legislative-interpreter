When I was 18 I became pregnant for the first time, and I decided that I was going to 
have an abortion. 
The state I lived in at the time had a law that required counseling and adequate, 
transparent information in regards to ending the life that was inside me. 
Because of the laws in Pennsylvania, I left that Planned Parenthood and never 
returned, because ultimately I chose to keep my son, who is now 19 years old. 
There hasn't been a day that has gone by , where I have not been grateful for that law 
that saved my son's life. 
I personally believe that both women, and children can benefit from ultrasounds and 
counseling before abortions.- There are an incredible amount of women who suffer 
from life long mental health issues, because of the depression caused by their 
abortions.
- This bill in no way restricts access to abortion, and it does not impact the rights of 
the mother who wants the abortion, but it DOES have the potential to save two lives 
at once. 
- My son is living , breathing proof that these laws save lives !
