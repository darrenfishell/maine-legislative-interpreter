LD 1614
Honorary members of the Judiciary Committee;
I am writing in support of LD 1614 - An Act to Require Ultrasound and Certain 
Counseling Before an Abortion
In order for a women to make a true, informed consent decision regarding whether or 
not to carry her baby to full term, she should at the very least be given all of the 
information available. Hence the term "informed" consent. This should include access
to an Ultrasound and counseling as to the actual development of the fetus and the full 
range of risks that may come from any form of termination of the pregnancy.
Please vote "ought to pass" for LD1614
Thank you for your time and consideration.
