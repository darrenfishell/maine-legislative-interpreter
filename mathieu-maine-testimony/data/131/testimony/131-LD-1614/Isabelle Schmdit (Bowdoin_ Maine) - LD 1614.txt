LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 1614, “An Act to Require an Ultrasound and 
Certain Counseling Before an Abortion.”  
The decision to terminate a life through abortion should always first require a 
thorough examination of the patient, to include the procedure of an ultrasound, since 
this safe and painless method is fundemental to determine the baby’s development, 
among other vital information concerning the baby.  
If abortion is an option, may it never be the only option.  Due to the serious nature of 
curtailing such a life, a pregnant woman ought first to be fully informed by all the 
personal information ascertained by the medical professional during the thorough 
examination.  Her view of the ultrasound screen is instrumental to her further 
understanding of the baby’s humanity, so ought not be obstructed.  Information 
related to pregnancy and parenting in general should also be dispensed, orally and in 
writing.  
In addition, where there is no emergency condition in the pregnant patient, it is 
absolutely reasonable to require a minimum period of 48 hours to pass prior to 
beginning the process of an abortion, if decided upon, so as to provide her time to 
process and deliberate over all the new information provided.  These steps of basic 
care performed by responsible medical professionals help to protect everyone 
concerned with a pregnancy and may even serve to prevent a baby’s death.   
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1614.  Thank you.
