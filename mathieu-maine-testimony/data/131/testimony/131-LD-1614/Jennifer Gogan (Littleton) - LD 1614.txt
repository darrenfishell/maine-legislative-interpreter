LD1614 An act to require an ultrasound and certain counseling before a n aborƟon 
 
I am wriƟng today in support of LD1614.  Over the years society in general has tried to teach us that an 
unborn baby is a fetus, a group of cells, just an unformed blob.  A person who’s never been pregnant 
before, a person who is immature and unaware of what life’s journey can bring, could very well have no 
idea about the forma Ɵon of the human body inside the womb.  It ’s not always real to a person at ﬁrst, 
someƟmes not Ɵll aŌer birth.  An ultra sound puts a face with a name so to speak.  The mother can see 
what is forming inside her womb.  Seeing for her own eyes the shape, the growth, the heart beaƟng 
inside her, she can make a cr iƟcal decision fully informed.    
 
Thank you for your service and a ƩenƟon.  Please vote yes on LD1614
