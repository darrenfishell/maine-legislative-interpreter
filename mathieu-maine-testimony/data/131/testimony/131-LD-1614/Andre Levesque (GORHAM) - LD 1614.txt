                                 BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
                                                                           Sponsored by : Rep. Abigail Griffin of Levant 
                                                                         Public Hearing May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. 
My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
So we meet again, after Mondays historic show of pro-life Mainers opposing LD1619 which would 
terminate the life of a newborn baby. 
I hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainer’s do not 
support the Governor’s Bill to kill our newborns. 
Today I support LD494,771,1197,1249,1614 and 1809. 
I support this bill for the following reasons: 
Medical facilities will provide a woman seeking abortion an ultrasound and inform them of all their 
options 
a. A medical provider will inform the patient of the procedure and risks of an abortion.  
b. Patient will be informed of alternative options including adoption and parenting. 
c. Patient will be informed of supportive community resources,  
d. Patient will be given an ultrasound which will be observed by the patient.  
e. Patient will be given a minimum of 48 hours to make an informed decision.  
f. All information given is documented and signed by the patient. 
When a child dies, Abortion is NOT Healthcare. 
I urge you to vote for LD 1614, It’s the right thing to do.
