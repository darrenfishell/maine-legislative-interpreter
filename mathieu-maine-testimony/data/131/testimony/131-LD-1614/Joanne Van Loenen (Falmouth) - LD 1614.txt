I am completely in support of this bill.  Having an abortion without an ultrasound and 
without certain counseling being made available to the mom is ludicrous.   What 
about INFORMED CONSENT??  Shouldnâ€™t a woman know exactly what is involved 
in the abortion, just as she should know what is involved in any other medical 
procedure??
