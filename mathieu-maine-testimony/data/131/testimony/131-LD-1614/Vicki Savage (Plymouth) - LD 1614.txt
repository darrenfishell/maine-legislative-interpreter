LD 1614
I am writing to ask that all Senators and Representatives please vote yes on LD 1614 
to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion.  I believe every
person should be able to see who they are carrying and be allowed to be counselled on
options that they have before they actually make the decision to abort.  The child, the 
person, whose life is at stake deserves that much from the mother who is carrying 
him/her before their life is terminated.  Thank you for your time and please vote yes 
on this bill.
