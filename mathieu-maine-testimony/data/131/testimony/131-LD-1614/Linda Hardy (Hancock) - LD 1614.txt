Linda Hardy
Hancock
LD 1614
Dear Judiciary Committee,
My name is Linda Hardy, from Hancock and I made a previous testimony on today's 
hearing for LD1249. Now I would like to express my support for LD1614 Requiring 
an Ultrasound before Abortion. As we all know, when a person requests an abortion, 
they are requesting the removal of a live growing pre-born baby from the mother's 
womb. This is clearly not her body. Requiring and Ultrasound, which is routinely 
used in surgical abortions and used in determining gestation of wanted pregnancies is 
truly providing information for informed consent. It may also be helpful in cementing 
the woman or girl's decision to terminate or not.
I also urge you all to support LD494, LD771 and LD1197 as these are all reasonable 
changes to current laws regarding the funding and procuring of an abortion.
