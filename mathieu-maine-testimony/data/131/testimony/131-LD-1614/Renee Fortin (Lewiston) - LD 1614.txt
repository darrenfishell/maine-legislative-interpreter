LD 1614
Sen Carney, Rep. Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Renee Fortin, I live in Lewiston
I am writing in support of LD 1614 - An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain 
Counseling Before an Abortion
Summary and Facts:Summary: LD 1614â€™s changes would provide a woman with 
more information to make a life-changing choice.
~13 states require verbal counseling or written materials to include information on 
accessing ultrasound services.
~27 states regulate the provision of ultrasound by abortion providers.
~ 6 states mandate that an abortion provider perform an ultrasound on each person 
seeking an abortion and require the provider to show and describe the image.
~10 states mandate that an abortion provider perform an ultrasound on each person 
seeking an abortion, and 8 of these require the provider to offer the patient the 
opportunity to view the image.
~ 8 states require that a patient be provided with the opportunity to view an ultrasound
image if their provider performs the procedure as part of preparation for an abortion.
~ 6 states require that a patient be provided with the opportunity to view an ultrasound
image.

them of all their options

abortion.

d. Patient will be given an ultrasound which will be observed by the patient.
e. Patient will be given a minimum of 48 hours to make an informed decision.
