The most widely accepted definition of abortion involves the ending of human life. 
As a Christian, I believe it is my duty to stand for those who are defenseless and have 
no voice and that the ending of their life is morally wrong. Ultrasound is a medical 
tool used regularly to give the provider and patient a window to the womb. As a father
of three, I was amazed by the use of ultrasound to see each of my children and hear 
their heart beat before they were born. There's nothing like it. Elective abortion 
should not be entered into lightly. Ultrasound imaging provides the sobering reality 
that inhabitants of the womb are not simply clumps of cells within the womb, but 
children worthy of preservation. I believe it is in the best interest of our society and 
our culture to do whatever we can to try to preserve the lives of the next generation of
Mainers and Americans.
