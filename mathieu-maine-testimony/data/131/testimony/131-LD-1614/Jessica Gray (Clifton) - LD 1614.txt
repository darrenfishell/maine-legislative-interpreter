Good morning! I would like to make known my opinion on the subject of having an 
ultrsound and counseling before a woman can chose to murder her baby. I believe all 
live is precious and the unborn is vulnerable and in need of our protection. Being able 
to see your child with an ultrasound will show the expectant mother that the baby is 
fully human from the moment of conception. With tiny fingers and toes and a beating 
heart. Counseling, I also think, is just as necessary as the ultrasound. The mother 
needs to understand her choices and the consequences to her and to the baby.
