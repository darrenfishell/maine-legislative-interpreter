Dear Committee Members:
A fetus is not a Clump of Tissue like some people claim.  Seeing an ultrasound of 
your child, can make all the difference in the world...a living, moving being.  There 
are organizations out there that do just that, and when the woman sees her child for 
the first time, she cannot abort.
Seeing is believing.  
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.  Thank you.
