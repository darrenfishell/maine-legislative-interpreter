Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee of the Judiciary, I am Norman Moyer of Waterville, Maine.  
I am providing this written testimony of my support of LD 1614, An Act to Require 
an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion. 
Abortion is an invasive, irreversible procedure that produces the death of a 
human life and effects the mother in many adverse ways. Unless there is a 
medical emergency, it should not be rushed through in a panicked manner by the 
mother. A 48 hour waiting period from informed consent by a health care 
professional plus the performance of an ultrasound is reasonable considering 
what is at stake. I have had several medical procedures where I wished I asked 
further questions to weigh the costs verses the benefits. (A finger surgery to 
remove a cyst, but I lost partial feeling in the finger. A stomach/hiatal hernia 
surgery to control GERD, but it is still with me.) The surgeries are in the past, but I 
live with the results in the present. What we are looking at here is of far more 
significance. 
Ultrasound is a normal, non-invasive tool used in pregnancies. It needs to be 
required by any contemplating an abortion.  
The use of ultrasound in the setting of pregnancy is vast and has become 
the standard of care in the evaluation of pregnant women. The average 
number of ultrasounds performed during pregnancy has increased from 1.5 
in 1995 to 1997 to 2.7 in 2005 to 2006, with even higher numbers of 
ultrasound studies obtained for high-risk pregnancies. (Dewald O. Ulrich CC, 
NIH) 
Ultrasound is safe for you and your baby when done by your health care 
provider. Because ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation, it’s 
safer than X-rays. Providers have used ultrasound for more than 30 years, 
and they have not found any dangerous risks.

I urge you to vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 1614. I also recommend that LD 494, LD 
771, LD 1197, LD 1249, LD 1410, and LD 1809 be voted ‘ought to pass’. 
Thank you for your consideration and time!
