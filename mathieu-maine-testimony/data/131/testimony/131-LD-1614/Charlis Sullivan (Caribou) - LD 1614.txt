Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 1614
Representative Abigail Griffin and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. 
I am here to testify in support of LD 1614, HP1039, An Act to Require and 
Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion. 
Other states are requiring ultrasounds and image viewing as prerequisite to abortion 
for the safety and welfare of women. All Maine women deserve the right to 
understand and view an ultrasound and to be informed prior to making an irreversible 
decision. In the case of ectopic pregnancy, an ultrasound may save the life of a mom.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD1614 that 
reflects an overwhelming consensus of Mainers. Thank you.
