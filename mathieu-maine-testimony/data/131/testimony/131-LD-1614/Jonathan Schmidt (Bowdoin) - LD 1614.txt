Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 1614. 
I support LD 1614 because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maine’s permissive abortion laws.   
Informed consent to a medical procedure includes having a thorough understanding of what 
the procedure entails, as well as complete information about what alternative treatment 
options exist.  For example, prior to shoulder or knee surgery, the doctor typically performs 
an MRI and discusses the resulting images and treatment options with the patient.  
Performing an ultrasound examination on a pregnant woman and sharing the results with 
her prior to executing an abortion procedure only makes sense.  To withhold this 
information from her constitutes something less than informed consent and is actually a 
form of coercion (“don’t think too long about this, you may change your mind.”).  very 
reasonable measure should be taken to ensure no woman decides to abort here unborn 
child in haste or ignorance. 
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS.. Thank you.
