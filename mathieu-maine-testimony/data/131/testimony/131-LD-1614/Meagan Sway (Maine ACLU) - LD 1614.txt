IINIERIIIIIN GIIIII LIBERTIES UNION 
Maine 
TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ 
Ought Not To Pass 
LD 1614 — An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before 
an Abortion 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings My name is Meagan Sway, and I am 
policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U S Constitutions On behalf of our members, I am here to testify 
against LD 1614 
If enacted, this legislation would require a medical provider to do the following 
when a patient seeks an abortion provide alternatives to abortion even when the 
patient does not request it, perform a medically unnecessary ultrasound, explain in 
detail “What the ultrasound images are depicting, ” show the patient the ultrasound, 
get a signed consent form that the patient has been presented with the ultrasound, 
and make the patient Wait 48 hours from the time the ultrasound is performed 
before performing the abortion 
This violates medical providers ’ First Amendment rights by compelling them to 
display the ultrasound and describe in detail features of the fetus, regardless of 
whether the physician or patient wishes for this to happen This sort of mandate 1S 
opposed by I'I13_]0I' medical associations, including the American Medical Association, 
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Public 
Health Association, because it violates basic ethical and informed consent 
principles 
The requirement of a 48-hour waiting period between the time of the ultrasound 
and the abortion procedure requires patients to make two trips to the doctor’s office 
Government-mandated delays serve no purpose other than to make obtaimng an 
abortion more difficult, dangerous, and expensive for the patients who are lest able 
to bear the burden of an unwanted pregnancy The harm of such restrictions is felt 
mostly by those who have the fewest resources — poor patients, minors, rural 
patients, Working patients without sick leave, and patients who are in dangerous 
interpersonal relationships
Government mandated delays also prevent people from 0bta1n1ng needed abort1ons 
Research, 1nclud1ng a study pubhshed 1n the Journal of the Amer1can Medlcal 
Assoc1at1on, shows that requlrmg women to make a separate tr1p to the c11n1c to 
recelve the state-mandated lnformatlon prevents between 10 and 13 percent of 
Women from gettlng the abortlons they seek For these patlents, maklng an 1n1t1al 
tI'1p to an abortlon provlder 1s mcredlbly d1ff1cult, maklng a second tr1p 1s 
1mp0ss1b1e 
Pregnant people have the const1tut1onal r1ght to choose to carry the1r pregnancy to 
term or to termlnate 1t Doctors have the rlght not to be compelled by the 
government to speak Because th1s b1ll would 1mperm1ss1bly 1nfr1nge on both of 
those const1tut1onal r1ghts, we urge you to vote ought not to pass
