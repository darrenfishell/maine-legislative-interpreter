Policy  Counsel,  Americans  United  for Life  
In Support  of L.D.  1614 
Submitted  to the Joint  Judiciary  Committee  
May  5, 2023   
Dear Chair Carney, Chair Moonen, and Members of the Committee:  
My Name is Danielle Pimentel, and I serve as Policy Counsel at Americans United for 
Life (“AUL”). Established in 1971, AUL is a national law and policy nonprofit organization 
with a specialization in abortion, end -of-life issues, and bioethics law. AUL publishes pro -life 
model legislation and policy guides,1 tracks state bioethics legislation,2 and regularly testifies 
on pro -life legislation in Congress and the States. Our vision at AUL is to strive for a world 
where everyone is welc omed in life and protected in law. As Policy Counsel, I specialize in 
life-related legislation, constitutional law, and abortion jurisprudence.  
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1614  (“LD 1614” or “bill) . 
LD 1614 require s health care professional s to provide pregnant women with information 
about the alternatives to abortion and perform an ultrasound  prior to an  aborti on.3 Further, 
the health care professional or qualified ultrasound provider must explain the ultrasound 
images to the pregnant woman and display the images so she can see them  if she so desires.4 
Lastly, LD 1614 prohibits a health care professional from performing an abort ion until 48 
hours have passed since the pregnant woman has given her informed written consent and 
received an ultrasound.5

 I have thoroughly reviewed LD 1614, and it is in my opinion that it  establishes 
necessary safeguards to  ensure a woman has voluntarily given her informed consent to an 
abortion. For this reason, I urge this Committee to vote in favor of LD 1614.  
I. Maine  has Robus t Powers  to Safeguard  the Informed  Consent  of Women  and 
Uphold  the Integrity  of the Medical  Profession  from  Abortion  Violence   
In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization , the United States Supreme Court 
overruled Roe v. Wade  and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey  and 
returned the abortion issue to the democratic process.6  This means that “States may regulate 
abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the 
Constitution, courts cannot ‘substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of 
legislative bodies.’”7 The Court acknowled ged that “[t] hese legitimate interests include 
respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development  . . . the protection of 
maternal health and safety  . . . [and] the preservation of the integrity of the medical 
profession.”8 
Even wi th Maine’s statutory protections for abortion,9 the standard principles of the 
practice of medicine must be followed. Informed consent, a foundational principle of modern 
medicine, “is a process by which the treating health care provider discloses appropriate 
information to a competent patient so that the patient may make a voluntary choice to accept 
or refuse treatment.”10 A woman cannot agree to medical treatment unless she is 
“competent, adequately informed and not coerced” in giving informed consent.11 If abortion 
is “medicine,” then healthcare prof essionals must receive a woman’s voluntary, informed 
consent before performing an abortion. Dobbs emphasized that the states have a legitimate 
interest in “the protection of maternal health and safety.”12 Bills like LD 1614 that give 
women the choice to se e her unborn child are important components to ensuring that the 
mother’s consent for an abortion is as fully informed as possible. As such, at least 27 states 
have enacted some type of ultrasound requirement to ensure women have the opportunity 
to make a more informed choice.13 
II. Ultrasound  and Waiting  Period  Provisions  Ensure  that  Women  Have  the 
Information  and Time  Needed  to Make  Informed,  Voluntary  Decision s 
Ultrasound provisions both promote wom en’s physical and psychological health and 
advance the states’ important and legitimate interest s in protecting life. Ultrasound

 requirements serve an essential and irreplaceable medical purpose because they are the 
only method of diagnosing ectopic pregnancies . If an ectopic pregnancy is left undiagnosed, 
it can result in infertility or even fatal blood loss .14 Furthermore, an ultrasound enables the 
healthcare provider to more accurately date the gestational age of a child. This is an 
important measure because a ccurate dating of pregnancy both protects the wom an by 
ensuring that the appropriate abortion procedure is performed and provides relevant 
information necessary to make an informed decision, since the risks of abortion increase as 
gestational age increases.15 
LD 1614 acknowledges that the choice  to have an abortion is a life -altering decision. 
Allowing a woman the opportunity to view her ultrasound ensures that she makes an 
informed choice because it gives her the option of seeing her unborn child as he or she really 
is, including his or her face  and form on a screen. Medical evidence indicates that women feel 
bonded to their children after seeing them on the ultrasound screen.16 Once that bond is 
established, researchers argue, a woman no longer feels ambivalent toward her pregnancy 
and in fact b egins to feel invested in her preborn child.17 Thus, by giving  every woman the 
choice to view her child’s ultrasound image, the state also furthers its interest in protecting 
life, as some women may ultimately decide to carry their child to term . In fact, a 2015  study 
found that 78% of women who see an ultrasound image of their infant in utero choose life 
for their baby.18 
Additionally, the 48 -hour reflection period in LD 161419—like the reflection periods 
ranging from 18 -hours to 72 -hours in 29 other states20—helps ensure a woman has the time 
she needs to take all the given information into account without the pressure of making an 
immediate decision since the “medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of an 
abortion are serious and can be lasting.”21 In fact, the Supreme Court determined waiting 
periods were not an “undue burden” and “[t]he idea that important decisions will be more 
informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection” was not “unreasonable.”22  
Ultimately, by requiring an ultrasound and waiting period before an abortion, this bill 
establishes necessary safeguards that protect women’s health as well as provide women

 with the reality of the life  of their  unborn chil d. It’s important to note that LD 1614 does not 
force a woman to view the ultrasound but gives her the option to look at the images if she 
chooses.  Implementing ultrasound and waiting period requirements help women 
understand the medical nature of abortion  and the impact it  has on women’s lives.  
III. LD 1614  Ensures  Women  Unders tand  There Are Real Alternatives  to Abortion   
LD 1614  provides a woman with material information to guide her abortion decisio n. 
Under the bill, health care professional  must inform women of the alternatives “to abortion 
such as childbirth and parenting and adoption and information concerning public and 
private agencies that will provide the woman with economic and other assistance to carry 
the fetus to term, including, i f the woman so requests, a list of these agencies and the services 
available from each.”23 This is important and material information  which lets a woman know 
she is not alone in her decision.  Informing women of t hese alternatives to abortion lets a 
woman k now that she h as financial and social support  if she needs it , which give her real 
options of giving birth and raising her child or  giving her child up for adoption to a loving 
family.  
This information is vital  as a woman considers abortion because she may  be under  
stressful circumstances . Women seek abortion for multiple reasons, including financial 
considerations, timing of the pregnancy, partner related reasons, and childcare concerns.24 
The pregnancy may be “unintended,” which may be a reason to seek an abortion. Notably, 
half of all pregnancies are characterized as “unintended.”25  
A woman seeking an abortion may be facing intimate partner violence (IPV). There 
are “[h]igh rates of physical, sexual, and emotional IPV . . . among women seeking a[n  
abortion].”26  For women seeking abortion, the prevalence of IPV is nearly three times 
greater than women continuing a pregnancy.27 Post -abortive IPV victims also have a 
“significant association” with “psychosocial problems including depression, suicidal 
ideation, stress, and disturbing thoughts.”28  
Similarly, intimate partners, family members, and sex traffickers may be asserting 
reproductiv e control  over the woman , which are  “actions that interfere with a woman’s 
reproductive intentions.”29 In the context of abortion, reproductive control not only

 produces coerced abortions or continued pregnancies, but it also affects whether the 
pregnancy was intended in the first place.30 Reproductive control is a prevalent issue for 
women. “As many as one -quarter of women of reproductive age attending for sexual and 
reproductive health services give a history of ever having suffered [reproductive control] .”31 
Thus, it is critical that women have authentic choice, and understand there are real 
alternatives to abortion.  
IV. Conclusion  
 Pregnant women deserve to be provided with the information necessary to make 
informed, voluntary decisions regarding their pregnancy. This bill guarantee s that a woman 
knows and understands her options, that she is able to see her unborn child , and that she is 
given enough time to process the information provided to her before making a life -altering 
decision. For these reasons , I strongly encourage this Committee to support LD 1614, which 
ensure s women are fully informed of the medical nature of abortion and the real alternatives 
to the procedure.
