LD 1614
LD 1614, An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an 
Abortion.  Position: SUPPORT.
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee:
My name is Michelle Truman of Hallowell, Maine.  I am writing in SUPPORT of LD 
1614.
When it comes to pregnancy, informed consent is what a woman needs.  An 
ultrasound is such a vehicle of informed consent, a "window to the womb". 
LD 1614 supports informed choice and hopefully prevents a lifetime of regret because
of blind, emotion-based action.  An informed decision is far superior. 
I also support LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249, and LD 1809 for the same reason.  
Knowledge is power.  
I strongly urge the Committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1614.  Thank you!
