LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
My name is Linda McMahon, I am from Harpswell, Maine, and I am writing in 
support of LD 1614 - An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling 
Before an Abortion 
Having an abortion is a life-changing event. There is no second chance. Women and 
girls need all the information that they can get to make the decision that is right for 
them. Please vote “Ought to Pass”. Thank you.
