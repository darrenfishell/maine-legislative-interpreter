Position: Support  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee.  My name is 
Ingrid Duran, I am the State Legislative Directo r representing the National Right to Life 
Committee.  I come before you today to write in support of LD  1614, “An Act to Require an 
Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion .” 
Ultrasound use prior to an abortion is routine care because it allows the physician to locate and 
date the pregnancy in order to choose  which me thod of abortion to employ .  A 2003 abortion 
provider study fo und that 98% of abortion providers use an ultrasound prior to performing an 
abortion.1 Moreover, Maine ’s abortion facility Main Family Planning also explains that an 
ultrasound is pe rformed prior to performing an abortion. From their website: “After some more 
time in the waiting room, so that the medications c an work, you will be called back to an exam 
room where you will have an ultrasound and the abortion.2”  Currently 28 states require  in their 
informed consent laws that  the mother to be informed of her opportunity to see her own 
ultrasound , Maine can become the 29th state.3 
Women deserve and have a right to see their ultrasound prior to an abortion.  Uninformed 
choices are not free choices.  A woman should not be denied information relative to her own 
experience.  Fo r these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1614 .  Thank 
you!
