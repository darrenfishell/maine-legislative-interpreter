Testimony of Bryan M. Dench in Support of LD 1614 
My name is Bryan Dench and I live in Portland, Maine. I am an adopted child born to a 
young college student in Massachusetts in 1949. I have three adopted children, one born in 
Bangor, one born in Delhi, India, and one in Dallas, Texas. I am testifying in support of this 
LD 1614 calling for true informed consent before abortions through requiring an 
ultrasound.  This minimal requirement assures that pregnant women are fully informed 
about their choices before undergoing abortions.  If we want “choice” should we not want 
that choice to be made only when a woman is in possession of all pertinent facts? A choice 
of such magnitude, with potentially life long repurcussions, should be undertaken only with 
a complete understanding of the facts. This is about the health of the pregnant woman as 
much as about protection of the unborn. It's common sense.
