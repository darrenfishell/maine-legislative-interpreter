Mame Rrght to Llfe 1s a state afﬁlrate of the Natronal R1ght To Lrfe Comm1ttee We are a non-proﬁt 
organrzatron founded to protect and uphold the drgnrty and worth of every human hfe from conceptron to) 
natural death by makrng abortron, 1nfant1c1de, and euthanasra socrally, ethrcally, and legally unacceptable 
and to actrvely promote posrtrve alternatrves

There’s another hfe that 1s 1mpacted here It 1s the hfe of the unbom baby Vorceless and rnnocent, th1s 
baby has rts own DNA, not hrs or her mother’s Therefore the dec1s1on wrll have a devastatrng lmpact— 
for, at the very least, 1t w11l k1ll one person 
For th1s reason, the unexpectant mother berng forced to make th1s dec1s1on, should be encouraged and 
supported to make a dec1s1on w1th a knowledge of fact and truth Any medrcal condrtron has an
