LD 1614
I am writing in support of LD 1614. Truly informed consent in the case of a life 
changing decision like abortion is warranted. Having worked in the abortion industry, 
I know that there is an assembly line atmosphere and a shuffling through of patients 
quickly. Slowing down the process will save lives, both of the baby and mother. It has
been proven that women often choose life for their babies after being given all the 
information about the life inside of them.
