LD 1614
Testimony in Support of LD 771, LD 1197, and LD 1614
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on the Judiciary:  
My name is Stephanie Anderson, and I live in Cape Elizabeth. 
During her May 1 testimony on LD 1619, a pastor of the Unitarian Universalist 
Church characterized bodily autonomy and choice as “sacred”. 
When it comes to reproductive freedom, Maine is proudly a pro-choice state.  This 
has been our law since 1993.  Pregnant women in Maine have a choice to either have 
an abortion or have a baby.  Both choices are forever choices. 
A choice is an act of selecting or deciding when faced with two or more possibilities. 
To make an intelligent choice, a real choice, the right choice for that woman– a 
woman facing a decision to have an abortion or to have a baby ought to have the full 
panoply of information about those two choices available. 
Without being provided to information about alternatives to abortion, pregnant 
woman cannot make a real choice.   This is why I urge you to support LD 1614.  
Without the right to withdraw consent for an abortion, pregnant women do not have a 
real choice.  The right to choose cannot exist without the right to un-choose.  To 
support a woman’s right to choose, the right to withdraw consent must be protected. 
This is why I urge you to support LD 771.
A woman’s choice to have an abortion should always be knowing, informed, and 
freely given.  She should never be coerced into having an abortion. This is why I urge 
you to support LD 1197. 
Thank you for your attention and for your service.
