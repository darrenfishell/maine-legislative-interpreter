Victoria Bucklin
Appleton
LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary; my name is Victoria Bucklin and I’m a resident of 
Appleton. I am writing in support of LD 1614.
When each of you took the oath of office, you swore to uphold both the US and the 
Maine Constitutions. The Maine Constitution in Article 1: Declaration of Rights; 
Section 1: Natural Rights states: All people are born equally free and independent, 
and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights, among which are those of 
enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property,
and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.  In Maine, we have laws that 
protect the baby eaglet in the egg because we want to protect our national bird, the 
eagle. Why do we not have laws that protect and defend the life of the baby child in 
the womb who will become our future citizens? 
Providing pregnant women with an ultrasound image of the baby living in their womb
often opens the eyes and heart to the preciousness of life. LD 1614 is one small step 
in defending the life and liberty, and pursuing and obtaining the safety and happiness 
of Maine’s future citizens.
