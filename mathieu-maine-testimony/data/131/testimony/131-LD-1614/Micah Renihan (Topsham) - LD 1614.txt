LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Micah Renihan, from Topsham, ME. I write to you today  in Support of 
LD 494, LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249, and LD 1614. 
Abortion is a serious matter involving many complexities, both moral and medical. 
Currently it is far too easy for women to attain an abortion in our state. These bills 
provide reasonable guardrails to the current statute regarding abortion. 
Requiring counseling and parental consent should be part of the abortion process. It is
important to remember that care for someone means care for the whole person, in 
ways that go beyond what a doctor is able to do. 
Limiting online and other digital forms of prescription is also common sense. It 
should not be possible to obtain an abortion without even seeing a doctor. 
Finally, protecting a women's right to withdraw consent should always be a priority - 
each woman who chooses to have an abortion ought to have the right to change her 
mind. 
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote OUGHT TO PASS on bills LD 494, 
LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249, and LD 1614. Thank you!
