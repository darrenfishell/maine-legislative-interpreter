Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Mame Committee on 
Judxciary. I am Wendy Memll from Benton 
I am here to testrfy rn support of LD 1197, An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion 
The State of Mame has a powerful duty to ensure a decrsron to abort 15 voluntary, 
without pressure, or coercron. Studies show that up to 60% of women abort 
because of pressure from someone else (https //tmygrl comlMlCoercionBan) A 
women pressured to abort is not making this deersron for herself. Just last mght,a 
woman told me that her husband coerced her into abomng her last baby by 
threatenmg to leave her and their hvmg chrldren. She d1d abort, but here she is 40 
years later, larnentmg that she caved to that pressure, st11l mommng the loss of her 
baby, and regrettmg havmg that abortron. He ended up leaving her anyway. 
In my role as Executrve Drrector of a pregnancy help center, I have Walked Wlllh 
numerous women through the process of heahng after abortron Most of those 
Women felt coerced to abort then‘ baby A piece of health rs mental health. Many 
Women suffer from mental health rssues after a coerced abortron. To ignore thrs 1s 
rrresponslble and cruel 
If we truly are about women & women’s nghts, about a Woman’s right to choose, 
then we must he domg everythrng we possibly can to ensure women are making 
abortion decrsrons after they have gathered all the facts, have ample tune to 
process them, and are m no way pressured to end the hfe of then baby Awoman 
Who is coerced rs not makmg her own chorce. 
I urge you to vote ‘YES’ to LD 1197, as well as to LD 494, LD 7'71, LD 1249, LD 
1614, and LD 1809. Thank you
