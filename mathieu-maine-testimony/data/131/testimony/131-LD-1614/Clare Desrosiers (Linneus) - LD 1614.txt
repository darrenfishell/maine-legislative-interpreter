LD 1614
LD 1614 - An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an 
Abortion
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting testimony in 
Support of LD 1614.
LD 1614 puts practices in place which provide more information and time for a 
woman to make a life-changing choices. Many women experience life-long trauma 
and regret from their abortions. This bill aims to prevent this trauma by ensuring 
women have access to has much information and options as possible. Requiring a 
waiting period of 48 hours to make a decision after receiving thorough information 
and options further allows the patient the time to reflect and consider different 
options. 
For these reasons, I ask you to support LD 1614.
Thank you.
