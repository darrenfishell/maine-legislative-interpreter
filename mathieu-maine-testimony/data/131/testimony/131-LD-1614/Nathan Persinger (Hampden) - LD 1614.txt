LD 1614
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee,
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1614. This is a common sense bill that protects
the lives of unborn children. An ultrasound is critical in providing an expectant 
mother with a clear picture of what an abortion costs - one human life. It is a critical 
piece of information that, if missing, a woman cannot truly give informed consent. 
Along with that, the receipt of alternatives, such as adoption and parenting resources 
are just as critical to give the expectant mother every opportunity to make a clear 
decision.
