Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and Members of the .lud1c1ary Comm1ttee, I 
am Rey Dubo1s, ﬁom Bangor, and I am speakmg 1n favor of LDs 494, 771, 1197, 1249, 
and 1614 
I base my presentatron on what 1s FAIR and what 1s MORAL 
The Hyde Amendment l1m1ts Med1ca1d re1mbursement for some abort1on costs, and 1t 1s 
ent1re1y fan that the Hyde Amendment be enforced 1n Mame, l1l<e 1t 1s 1n most other 
states Tax payers should not be forced to pay for the electlve procedures that are 
abo1t1on, when they profoundly drsagree wrth abo1t1on, the k1llmg of a pre-born chrld 
Our elderly , mtellectually d1sabled, and homeless people need those tax dollars more 
than the 98% of women who become pregnant through then‘ own behavlors We 
taxpayers should not have to pay for the consequence of a man and a woman's 
consensual act that results 1n an unplanned pregnancy It's t1me for them to pay for the 
result of thelr own dec1s1ons 
An Act to Protect a Woman's R1 ght to W1thdraW Consent for an Abort1on makes so much 
sense, that I'm even surpnsed to see that th1s leg1slat1on must be requ1red as a law Don't 
we all agree that "NO" means "NO! " 
Shouldn't you be allowed to change your mrnd, 
save a baby's hfe, and have your dec1s1on respected Pass LD 771 wrthout any hagglmg 
It makes so much sense 
LD 1197 1s s1m1larly so stra.1ght forward that 1t should pass w1thout res1stance It 1s Just 
so FAIR that a woman should not be coerced 1nto l<1ll1ng her chrld Aren't people always 
grven appropnate mformat1on/educat1on re electlve procedures 
LD 1249 restr1ct a Phys1c1an from prescnbmg abo1t1on through telehealth Wouldn't you 
thmk that an eth1cal med1cal pract1t1oner would want to do an actual face to face 
phys1cal exam of a pregnant lady before domg somethmg so clrastrc as krll her ch1ld To 
abort a baby W1thout1cnow1ng the correct fetal age, placenta locatron, or potentral 
presence of ectoprc pregnancy seem tantamount to malpract1ce Isn't the health and 
safety of the mother supposed to be so 1mportant ‘? LD 1249 certa1nly protects the health 
and safety of the mother more than ANY of the b1lls drscussed 1n heanngs on Monday 
LD 1614 requ1res that an ultrasound be completed and counsel1ng be prov1ded 
Appropnate d1agnost1cs and full d1scuss1on of safety and optrons seems 11ke somethmg a 
respectable practltloner would provlde 
All of us test1fy1ng today are go1ng to tell you these b1lls ought to pass, and I recommend 
that you vote "Ought to pass" , but not _]11Sll because they mlght result 1n fewer bab1es 
be1ng lulled Pass these b1lls because they'll result 1n the mothers bemg treated more 
safely and profess1onally, and the med1cal prov1ders w1ll pract1ce therr trade 1n a more 
profess1onal manner
