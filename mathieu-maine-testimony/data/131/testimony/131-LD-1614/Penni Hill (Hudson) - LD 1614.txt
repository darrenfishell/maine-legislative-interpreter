LD 1614
Chairperson and Members of the Committee,
I thank you for your time and your service to our beautiful state of Maine.
I would like to offer testimony on LD 1614: An Act to Require an Ultrasound and 
Certain Counseling before an Abortion. 
Many women think their only option is abortion in an unplanned pregnancy and they 
are distraught about it. 
Pregnancy option education and an ultrasound that the pregnant woman can view are 
crucial for her to make an informed decision concerning her pregnancy and for her 
lifelong mental health.  
No woman should feel pressured to have an abortion when she does not want to have 
one. 
Women are strong and intelligent. They should not be kept in the dark and 
information should not be held back from them. 
Many women choose to carry to term when they learn they do not HAVE to have an 
abortion.
The science is clear. It is without doubt a human child growing inside a pregnant 
woman. Research is becoming more and more clear all the time as well - many 
women who have had abortions, regret them. 
The very least providers can do is give a woman all her pregnancy options, show her 
the truth - that it is a "little one" in her uterus, fetal development information on her 
pre-born child, and offer her a little time to slow down and truly consider what she 
needs to do. 
Withholding the truth from a woman, is a great disservice to her and for so many it 
ends in an ongoing, lifelong heartache of regret. 
The women of Maine deserve better.
I ask that you vote LD 1614 ought to pass. 
Thank you,
Penni Hill, Hudson, ME
