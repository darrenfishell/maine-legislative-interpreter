Susan Strickland
Brunswick
LD 1614
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
 
My name is  Susan Strickland from Brunswick, Maine. I would like to add my voice 
in support of LD 1614 to require ultrasound and counseling before an abortion.
Like many, I have had a number of scans & tests for various health concerns. Twenty 
five years ago I was diagnosed with a life-threatening tumor which was also 
potentially malignant. I was required to receive multiple scans: ultrasound, MRI, and 
CT scans to determine the placement, size, and other features that I might be treated 
accordingly. After each scan I was given personal, one-on-one consultation with the 
radiologist and doctor. I was shown my scans and each feature was thoroughly 
explained to me so that I knew exactly what I was up against. This was deemed 
"necessary" for proper treatment.
 In my case the tumor was a disease, yet I was given full access to information about 
it. LD 1614 is simply requiring the same medical treatment for a pregnant woman - 
except that there is the potential of removing not disease but another human life. Each
woman should be required (per usual medical practices) to not only have an 
ultrasound but to see it and have every aspect explained to her. 
I could have denied treatment after seeing the results of the scans of my tumor and 
tests, but I could have died. LD 1614 simply ensures that women are given the full 
picture before there is a guarantee of death - that of the baby inside her womb.
Thank you.
