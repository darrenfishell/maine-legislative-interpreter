LD 1614
Please vote LD 1614 ought to pass.  Shouldn't a woman be entitled to know all the 
facts about what she is about to do before making her decision whether or not to abort
her baby?  Why would an abortion clinic not want a woman to see the ultrasound 
images?  They say it rarely makes a woman change her mind, but that's not what we 
hear from pregnancy centers.  What harm is there in letting her see the images if it 
will not change the outcome as far as the abortion clinic is concerned?  When you as a
legislator are preparing to vote on a bill, you are required to listen to live testimony 
and to read written testimony regarding the bill.  You must consider evidence both for
and against the bill, as well as other information neither for not against.  Why?  So 
you can gather the facts and make an informed decision.  Shouldn't a woman be given
the opportunity to gather the facts and make an informed decision as well?  If you 
vote against this bill, you are saying that women should not be allowed all of the 
available facts, or that women cannot be trusted to make a wise decision if they are 
given all the available facts.  That is sex discrimination.  Please support women by 
voting LD 1614 ought to pass.
