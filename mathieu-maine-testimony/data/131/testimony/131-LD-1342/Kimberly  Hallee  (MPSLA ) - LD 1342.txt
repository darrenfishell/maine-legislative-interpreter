In 2008 or thereabouts Salmon Lake aka Ellis Pond in Belgrade and Oakland had an 
infestation of Invasive Eurasian Milfoil. The McGrath Pond Salmon Lake 
Association, MEDEP and others worked in concert and diligence to eradicate the 
highly invasive Plant. Each summer the 7 Lakes Alliance and MPSLA under DEP 
guidance provide an Invasive Plant Patrol to evaluate the coves, outlet streams and 
benthic areas. Additional Lake front property owners volunteer to monitor their 
shorelines for invasive plants. I am a 10 year member of MPSLA and have 
participated and donated countless hours on these needed endeavors. But training,  
education,  research,outreach, followup  collaboration with nonprofits and other 
agencies requires skills, materials,  support staff and well educated staff, etc.. Clear, 
clean lakes in Maine are our life blood and bread and butter!! Our warming climate,  
increased tourism,  Lake hoping,  out of state invasive Plants, etc. all threaten our 
healthy lakes. 
It takes money to " run a well oiled machine " , prices are rising and as my Mother 
always said "you get what you pay for "!! Thank you.
