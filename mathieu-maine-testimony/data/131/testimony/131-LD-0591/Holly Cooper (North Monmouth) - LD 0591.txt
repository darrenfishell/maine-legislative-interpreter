Testimony in Support of L.D. 591, An Act to Require the State of Maine to Pay Medicare Premiums for 
Certain State Employees
After 33 years as a State of Maine employee, I retired with full health benefits as promised to me when I 
began my State career in 1978.    However, upon my reaching the age of 65, the State of Maine advised 
me I would need to move off my State of Maine primary health plan and apply for Social Security 
benefits that would include Medicare.    I was told this would be based solely on the fact that my ex-
spouse qualified for SSA benefits, and thereby also Medicare.    This would be the case regardless of the 
fact that on my own I do not qualify for SSA benefits or Medicare.    As directed, I applied for SSA via my 
ex-spouse’s work history and was told due to the federal offset requirement, I would not be eligible for 
any of my ex-spouse’s SSA benefits.   However, I would be required to receive Medicare and pay for that 
health insurance out of my own pocket.    This amounts to approximately an added $2,000/year cost for 
me when I otherwise would have been able to continue on the State of Maine health care plan at no 
cost, as do many other State retired employees with whom I share the same eligibility criteria, except 
that I was once married to someone who was eligible for SSA benefits.    For me this is ultimately a 
matter of fairness:  Why should I and others in the same boat, be penalized with a $2,000/year cost by 
simply once being married to someone (from who I’ve been divorced for many years at this point).    On 
my own merits, I do not benefit from any SSA payments, but must pay for the cost of Medicare.    If I had 
remained single throughout my career, I would not be paying this burdensome extra cost at a time when 
every dollar counts towards rising living expenses.
I thank the committee for the opportunity to submit this testimony and urge your support of this bill.
