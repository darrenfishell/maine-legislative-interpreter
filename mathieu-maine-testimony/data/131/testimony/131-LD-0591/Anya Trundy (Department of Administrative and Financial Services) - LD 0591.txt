Testimony of Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services 
testifying neither for nor against 
LD 591, An Act to Require the State to Pay Medicare Premiums for Certain Retired State 
Employees 
Sponsored by Sen. Hickman 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, l am Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations for the 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services. l am providing testimony today neither 
for nor against LD 591. . 
DAFS fully recognizes that health insurance coverage is a major expense in most people’s 
personal budgets, its continually rising cost places increasing strain on lower and ﬁxed incomes, 
and it is often a key deciding factor in where people work and when they retire. Furthermore, 
Medicare in particular, is confusing and difficult to navigate, and many people are unpleasantly 
surprised to learn of the monthly premium for Medicare Part B coverage. 
DAFS‘s understanding is that LD 591’s intent is to address the issue of pre-1986 state 
employees who wouldn’t have contributed to Medicare during their working years and had an 
expectation based upon when first employed by the state that their health insurance premiums 
in retirement would be covered in full by the state, but who in retirement have been determined 
Medicare eligible via a spouse and are paying a monthly premium for Medicare Part B coverage. 
This is a narrower issue pertaining to a subset of the population encompassed by LD 111 that 
this committee heard last month. DAFS would encourage the Committee to work LD 591 
concurrent with LD 111. I - A - 
Furthermore, if that is indeed the intent of LD 591, the primary challenge of the bill may be 
identifying the population of state retirees to whom the bill would apply because determination 
of their Medicare eligibility is based upon their unique personal circumstances and information 
unavailable to the State. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. l am happy to try to answer questions from the 
committee
