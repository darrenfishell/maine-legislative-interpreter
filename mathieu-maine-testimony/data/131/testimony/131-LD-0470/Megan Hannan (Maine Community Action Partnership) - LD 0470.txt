207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 470 An Act to 
Support Lead Abatement in Older Residential Properties 
April 14, 2023g 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Special Committee 
on Housing, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership and we support LD 470 An Act to Support 
Lead Abatement in Older Residential Properties. 
As you know, Maine has some of the oldest housing stock in the nation. 
This poses many separate and interwoven challenges to assuring our 
communities have access to affordable, appropriate housing. The 
original sticks and bricks are crumbling; the paint is peeling; and where 
the paint is lead based, it is poisoning the people who live there, 
especially the children. 
The Maine CDC designates seven towns, reduced to four communities, 
as high-risk lead poisoning areas. They keep close track of testing 
children under three years of age, print the results and compare the 
incidence of lead poisoning to other, lower risk areas of the state. The 
top risk factors are, of course, older housing and poverty. 
Not surprisingly, of those high-risk communities, Auburn and Lewiston 
lead the percent of children who are tested whose blood tests show 
greater or equal to ﬁve milligrams per deciliter of blood - which is the 
threshold for what we would call “lead poisoning ” — at 4.9 and 4%, 
respectively. However, within the top ten communities, Rockland, witha 
positive rate of 5.8%, leads that measure but has a much lower number 
of children screened. ‘ 
For those children who are diagnosed with lead levels higher than 
deemed safe, the CDC offers a host of supports for those children and 
their families. 
This bill will support lead poisoning prevention. Our Community Action 
Agencies are doing lead abatement now, but we can never do as many 
buildings as we’d like to. Adding $1 million per year, for the next few 
years, will help us to make more homes safe for children and families. 
Thank you for your time and attention, l am happy to try to answer any 
questions you have. V
