LD 464
Good Morning,
As the parent of an adult child with Down Syndrome, I urge you to consider and pass LD464 
to eliminate waitlists for services for our son and others. Our son is fortunate to have services 
provided under Section 29, but there is no end in sight for him to benefit from the 
comprehensive services under Section 21- most important this would benefit him for 
independent or supported living in an inclusive neighborhood setting. As my husband and I 
enter our senior years, we want the best for our son for his future, knowing that housing and 
support will be provided to him for his life.  We are grateful for the service provided under 
Section 29 and 21, supplement with private funds, and look forward to this security for him. 
Thank you.
