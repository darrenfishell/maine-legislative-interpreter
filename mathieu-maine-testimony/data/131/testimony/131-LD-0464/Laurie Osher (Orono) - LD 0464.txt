Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
introduce
and
express
my
support
for
LD
464,
An
Act
to
Eliminate
W aiting
Lists
for
Community-based
Services
for
People
with
Autism
Spectrum
Disorder ,
Intellectual
Disability ,
Brain
Injury
or
Other
Related
Conditions
.
This
is
a
straightforward
bill
to
address
a
problem
this
committee
knows
well:
the
unmet
need
for
services
that
support
people
with
disabilities
and
older
Mainers
in
their
own
homes
and
communities.
As
of
December
2022,
2,267
individuals
are
on
one
or
more
waitlists
for
MaineCare-funded
Home-
and
Community-based
Services
for
people
with
disabilities.
These
include
Mainers
on
the
waitlists
for
waivers
under
Sections
18,
20,
21,
and
29
of
the
MaineCare
Manual.
For
many
of
them,
that
means
waiting
years
for
the
services
they
need.
For
example,
the
typical
wait
for
Section
21
services
is
six
years.
There
are
also
1,749
older
Mainers
on
the
Section
63,
Section
69,
and
Chapter
11
waitlists.
These
are
folks
waiting
for
home-based
care
and
independent
support
services.
Taken
all
together ,
thousands
of
Mainers
are
going
without
the
care
and
support
they
need.

T estimony
of
Repr esentative
Laurie
Osher ,
PhD
I
think
the
majority
of
us
in
the
Legislature
can
agree
this
is
unacceptable.
I
think
most
of
our
constituents
would,
too.
LD
464
seeks
to
finally
eliminate
these
waitlists
so
that
our
friends
and
neighbors
can
access
the
support
they
need
to
lead
safe,
fulfilling
and
independent
lives.
There
are
certainly
previous
and
ongoing
efforts
to
alleviate
the
unmet
need
for
these
services.
The
Governor ’s
biennial
budget
proposal,
if
enacted,
would
eliminate
the
current
waitlist
for
Section
29
services
and
somewhat
reduce
the
Section
63
waitlist.
I
believe
we
can
–
and
must
–
do
all
that
and
more.
You
will
likely
hear
today
that
the
Department
is
proposing
to
close
Sections
20,
21
and
29
services
to
new
enrollees,
replacing
them
with
a
new
Lifespan
Waiver
that
is
being
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
people
with
disabilities
more
seamlessly
in
the
future.
The
plan
is
to
have
the
lifespan
waiver
operational
by
2025.
The
program
is
likely
to
ramp
up
slowly
and
will
not
fully
address
the
needs
of
all
those
who
are
currently
waiting
for
support
in
the
years
between
now
and
then.
This
isn’t
enough.
The
needs
of
people
with
disabilities
will
not
disappear
during
the
years
that
this
new
waiver
is
being
developed.
Many
people
have
already
been
waiting
for
years
-
some
more
than
a
decade.
They
continue
to
face
debilitating
trauma
now
from
not
having
needed
supports
in
place.
I
understand
that
the
Department
may
have
concerns
that
doing
more
on
wait
lists,
without
doing
more
on
workforce,
won’ t
meet
the
needs
of
these
Maine
residents
whose
lives
have
been
put
on
hold
for
so
long.
I
agree.
But
the
solution
isn’t
to
continue
stranding
people
on
wait
lists.
The
solution
is
to
address
wait
lists
and
also
workforce,
including
by
raising
direct
careworker
pay
to
market
rates.
LD
464
addresses
the
first
of
these
twin
problems.
You
will
see
proposed
legislation
later
in
this
session
to
also
address
the
second
of
these
twin
problems.
I
hope
you’ll
pass
both.
For
the
people
on
these
waitlists
and
their
loved
ones,
the
need
is
urgent.
Many
of
them
have
no
other
coverage
as
they
wait
for
these
MaineCare-funded
services,
and
for
others,
the
support
they
do
have
falls
far
short
of
what
they
need
to
thrive
in
their
own
communities.
Please
act
to
pass
LD
464
and
eliminate
the
waitlists
for
these
crucial
community-based
services.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
I
am
happy
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
have
for
me.
