Testimony in support of: 
LD 464 "An Act to Eliminate Waiting Lists for Community-based Services for People with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Brain Injury or Other Related 
Conditions"
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Nicole Easler and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate and I want you to know 
that I support LD 464. 
This bill is important to me because I should have received adult service when I was 18 but I 
received children’s services until I was 21 and I had to wait until I was 21 to be put on an adult 
services waitlist.  I continued with children’s services due to the wait list being too long.  I did 
finally receive Section 29 services and I have been put on the wait list for section 21 since 2016 
as priority 3. 
My health has deteriorated and my needs have increased since then and my caseworker helped 
me submit paperwork requesting my priority level move up. I have yet to hear from them or be 
put into a higher priority since 2016.  Nobody has contacted me from DHHS or Maine Care, I 
can’t ask for a new case manager because I would have to wait on another list.  
It is unreasonable to keep people on the waitlist indefinitely.  Maine Care should reassess 
people’s needs while on the long-lasting waitlist. I asked to be reassessed at the end of 2022 for 
reconsideration of needs but I have not heard back from them yet. 
I think you should fund and eliminate wait lists for services, and therefore should pass LD 464. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Nicole Easler
