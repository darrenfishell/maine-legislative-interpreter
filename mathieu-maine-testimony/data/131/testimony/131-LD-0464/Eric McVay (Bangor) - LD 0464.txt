Testimony in support of: 
LD 464 "An Act to Eliminate Waiting Lists for Community-based Services for People with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Brain Injury or Other Related 
Conditions"
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Eric McVay. I live in Bangor and I am a self-advocate. I am here today in support of 
LD 464 because I am in support of clearing the wait lists. People have been sitting on wait lists 
for a long time waiting for services. I really want to see wait lists go away. 
Eliminating the wait lists would make it so much better for people to access the services they 
need. When they sit on a wait lists they are being left behind by a system that has created these 
wait lists. We should be able to be included in our community and be able to receive the services 
we need. 
I strongly urge you to move ought to pass on this bill. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Eric McVay 
Bangor, ME
