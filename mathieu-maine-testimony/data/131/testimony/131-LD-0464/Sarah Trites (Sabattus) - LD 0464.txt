Testimony supporting LD 464 from Sarah Trites
I have an acquired brain injury and have qualified for services under Section 18. Because there
are no slots available in Section 18, I was given some services under Section 19.  I am very
grateful for these services, but I would benefit greatly from more support.
I support the passage of LD 464 which eliminates the wait lists for Sections 21, 29, 18 and 20. I
would then be able to receive the following services under Section 18:
Assistive Technology Device and Services specifically related to my visual impairment
and physical disability (I am confined to a wheelchair).
I would benefit from a more comprehensive Care Coordinator Service with actual
face-to-face meetings.  I would love to take advantage of community opportunities with
the coordinatorâ€™s help. I would receive the following:  assistance with community
inclusion, transportation and adult education support with social and leisure
development.
In section 18.05-6   Home Supports Services Level 1, which relates to my situation
because I live in my own apartment, I would be able to receive the following services that
I do not get under section 19:  * assistance with community inclusion
*  transportation
*  adult education supports with social and leisure skills
I would continue to receive my personal care and homemaker services under Section
18.
In section 18.05-7     Non-medical Transportation, I would need transportation to
community based opportunities as developed in my new care plan for times when my
family is not available.
This bill would greatly benefit so many people like myself in the State of Maine to have
as productive and happy lives as possible.
Thank you,
