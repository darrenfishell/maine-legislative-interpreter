Testimony in support of: 
LD 464 "An Act to Eliminate Waiting Lists for Community-based Services for People with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Brain Injury or Other Related 
Conditions"
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate and I work for Speaking 
Up For Us, Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. I am testifying in favor of LD 464. 
I would like to see the waitlists get eliminated because people with disabilities who have to wait 
for services spend a long time on the wait list. The wait list currently have too many people on it 
and I don’t want to see people with disabilities go through waiting around to get the support they 
need. I would also like to see people with disabilities be able to be supported to get their own 
place, or move in with someone they choose. 
I think this will help people with disabilities to get the services they need so they can have the 
support and receive services in their community. 
I think the committee should vote to pass this bill.  
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Jon McGovern
