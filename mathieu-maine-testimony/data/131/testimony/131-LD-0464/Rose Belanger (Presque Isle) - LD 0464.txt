Testimony in support of: 
LD 464 "An Act to Eliminate Waiting Lists for Community-based Services for People with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability, Brain Injury or Other Related 
Conditions"
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
My name is Rose Belanger and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate and I want you to 
know that I support LD 464. 
I want to see that everyone on the wait list gets the services that they need especially the new 
generation of people just graduating. In the future, I want to see that people never see a waiting 
list and are set up with services immediately after applying.  
I had to reapply for adult services when I was 21 and it was tough on me and my family to not 
get the services that I needed. Dealing with the confusion of stopping child services, taking a few 
years off, and then reapply for adult services took a toll on me and my family.
I would encourage you to pass LD 464. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,
Rose Belanger 
Presque Isle, ME
