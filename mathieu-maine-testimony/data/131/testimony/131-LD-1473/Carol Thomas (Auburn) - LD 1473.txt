My name is Carol Thomas.  I live in Auburn.  My family has 6 generations in L/A 
that have made use of Lade Auburn drinking water, one generation that has made use 
of Sebago water through Portland, and 4 generations that have used unfiltered water 
in Casco.  
I would urge you to give this measure a positive vote.  I ask this for both economic 
and ecological reasons.  Many, many Mainers live with tight budgets. Businesses also
have a tight bottom line.  Failing to protect our filtration waivers would lead us to 
bills that none of us need, and that many of us can't afford.
If we fail to protect these bodies of water, we risk pollution, a loss of fisheries, and 
filtration mandates.  Is this the Maine you want to live in?  
We have a gift here in Maine - let's continue to respect and enjoy it.
