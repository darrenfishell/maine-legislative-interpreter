Letter in Support of LD 1473 
 
My name is Meredith Shore. I am a lifelong (77 years and counting) Maine resident, having 
grown up and still living in Auburn. 
 
I support LD 1473 for the following reasons. 
 
According to a report from CNBC,(Dec. 2021) Maine has the 4th highest tax burden of all the 
United States. Also, it is the “oldest” state in the union. (Population Reference Bureau. Dec. 
2021). Between high taxes and lower income in retirement, many people in my demographic 
struggle to keep up with the costs of daily living.  
 
We in Maine are blessed with some of the cleanest water in the country, and in those areas 
where the water supply has a filtration waiver, this clean water is also very affordable – an 
important blessing for us old folks. 
 
While recognizing that housing is a significant need in this state, housing without clean 
affordable drinking water is self-defeating.  It makes sense to me to limit development around 
any lake or other source of water that supplies drinking water to citizens. The more 
development, the greater the risk to the lake that supplies that water, and the more likely the 
lake will lose its waiver and necessitate an expensive filtration system, raising both the direct 
cost to the rate payers and property taxes to homeowners.  
 
In the interest of preserving our clean lakes and keeping clean drinking water affordable, I urge 
you to look favorably on LD 1473. While it is not a panacea, it is a step in the right direction, 
especially for seniors with limited incomes.
