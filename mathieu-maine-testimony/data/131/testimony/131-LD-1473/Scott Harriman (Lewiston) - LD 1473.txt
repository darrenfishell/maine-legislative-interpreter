Good
afternoon
Senat or
Br enner ,
Repr esentativ e
Gr amlich,
and
honor able
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Envir onment
&
Natur al
Resour ces.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman,
I
liv e
in
Lewist on,
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1473,
“ An
Act
t o
Pr otect
Cer tain
Unﬁlter ed
Drinking
W ater
Sour ces. ”
Her e
in
Lewist on
and
A uburn,
we
ha v e
been
dr awing
our
drinking
water
fr om
Lak e
A uburn
(formerly
Wilson
P ond)
for
close
t o
150
y ears.
Due
t o
the
extr aor dinar y
effor ts
that
ha v e
been
made
o v er
the
decades
t o
pr otect
the
quality
of
the
lak e,
this
water
has
been
gr anted
a
ﬁltr ation
waiv er
fr om
the
EP A.
Only
a
f ew
do z en
such
waiv ers
ha v e
been
gr anted
nationwide.
What
this
means
for
the
r atepa y ers
of
Lewist on
and
A uburn
is
that
the y
ha v e
not
had
t o
incur
the
huge
expense
of
building
and
maintaining
a
water
ﬁltr ation
plant.
Any
incr eased
de v elopment
in
the
lak e ’ s
watershed
will
thr eaten
the
status
of
the
ﬁltr ation
waiv er ,
leading
t o
the
need
for
a
tr eatment
plant.
While
I
am
fully
in
suppor t
of
dr amatically
incr easing
the
inadequate
number
of
housing
units
all
o v er
Maine,
critical
r esour ces
lik e
our
drinking
water
cannot
be
compr omised.
W e
can
still
build
plenty
of
homes
in
ar eas
that
do
not
dr ain
int o
and
thr eaten
the
quality
of
water
bodies
lik e
Lak e
A uburn.
Please
help
pr otect
our
drinking
water
and
v ote
Ought
T o
P ass

Thank
y ou
for
y our
time
and
for
y our
ser vice

our
state.
