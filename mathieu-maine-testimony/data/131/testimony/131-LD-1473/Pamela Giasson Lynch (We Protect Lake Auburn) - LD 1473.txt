Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1473, An Act to Protect Certain Unf iltered Drinking Water Sources  
 
Hope this finds you well.  My name is Pamela Giasson Lynch  and I grew up in Auburn, Maine.  My 
mother lives in Auburn, and we’ve been a part of the Auburn community since the 1980 ’s.  I am writing  
on behalf of my family : some of  who m still lives in Aubur n, and my husband, kids, and I who come  to 
spend time  in Auburn .  We are concerned citizens to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1473.  
Lake Auburn is beautiful.  I grew up going to see Lake Aub urn, and recognize after living in four other 
states and 1 other country that Maine is uniquely blessed with pristine and abundant drinking water.  Of 
the 40 bodies of water in the country that have these waivers  of water filtration , nine  are located in 
Maine (almost 1 quarter)!  Growing up in Maine I didn ’t realize how lucky I was.  I want my kids to enjoy 
the beauti ful landscapes and see the  picturesque water of Maine as well.  
Professionally, I am a chemical engineer, and have been practicing in the sustainability field for almost 
20 years.  I am  Chief Operating Officer at Aclarity  (https://www.aclaritywater.com/ ), and we develop 
and deploy water purification systems .  Sustainable development is most successful when you listen to 
local community members and you work across diverse groups.  Too many cities and towns are currently 
needing to install large waste water or water treatment facilities.  I ’ve recently seen  costs  anywhere 
from 1 .5 to 15 million dollar s.  This would be detrimental to some of the local community members  in 
Maine .  The operating costs almost always come back to the  tax payers.  I believe in equitable access to 
clean water.  It’s documented Maine has some of the best d rinking water in country.

Maine has naturally some of the best water in the world.  Let’s not change that.  Please vote “ought to 
pass” on LD 1473 .
