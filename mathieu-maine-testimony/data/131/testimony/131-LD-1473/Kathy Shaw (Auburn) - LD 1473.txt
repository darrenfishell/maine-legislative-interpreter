LD 1473
My name is Kathy Shaw, State Representative  from district 88 and one of the 
co-sponsors of LD1473.
As a resident of Auburn and a farmer, I am acutely aware of the importance of 
preservation of our clean water supplies.. I rely on well water for my farm and crop 
needs  and we are diligent in protecting our water supply..
I  believe that there can be no guess work when it comes to our clean drinking water, 
and that we need to be ever vigilant in the protection of that supply whether private, 
but  especially public. Our citizens depend on it and it is too precious a resource for us
to gamble on it for our future generations.
Development should be discouraged around our public drinking water supplies 
statewide, there should be no negotiation on that aspect. There are too many 
unknowns now and in the future.
Thankyou for your attention and time.
Kathy Shaw
