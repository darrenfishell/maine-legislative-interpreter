LD 1473

Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Members of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee,
     My name is Christine Holden, and I live in Lewiston.  I am submitting testimony 
in support of LD 1473, An Act to Protect Certain Unfiltered Drinking Water Sources, 
which will help protect Nine water sources in Maine, including Lake Auburn which 
provides pure drinking water to the communities of Lewiston, Auburn and Poland.  
     I moved to Lewiston in 1969, a time when the waters of the Androscoggin were 
still badly polluted, and I remember joining the first celebrations of Earth Day in 
April the following spring.
We have just celebrated over 50 years of Earth Day, and concerns about water quality
continue: this bill focuses on a particular opportunity to preserve the quality and 
affordability of several sources of pure drinking water in Maine, including Lake 
Auburn.
     The current purity of the lake, which is recognized by the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s grant of a waiver against filtration, is under threat from proposed
development in Auburn.  The development has been justified by some as permitted by
LD 2003, enacted last year—whose purpose was to increase the amount of affordable 
housing, which is certainly badly needed in Maine.  But not at the expense of clean, 
affordable drinking water, which will likely be the case if the areas developed within 
the lake’s watershed affect the quality of the water, thus requiring water system 
filtration and consequent higher prices for water for all consumers—owners and 
renters.
     Voting this bill favorably out of your committee will help insure that taxpayers in  
communities across the state, from larger ones such as Portland, Lewiston-Auburn 
and Bangor-Brewer, to smaller ones such as Bar Harbor and Eagle Lake, continue to 
enjoy clean, affordable water.  
     I thank Senators Rotundo (Androscoggin), Baldacci (Penobscot) and Grohoski 
(Hancock) and Representatives Lee and Shaw from Auburn, and Cloutier, Craven, 
Abdi and Lajoie from Lewiston for their sponsorship, and ask the committee members
for their consideration of this important bill.
Sincerely, Christine Holden
