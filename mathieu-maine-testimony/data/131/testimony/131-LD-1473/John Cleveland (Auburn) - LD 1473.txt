Testimony in favor of LD 1473 
An Act to Protect Certain Unfiltered Drinking Water Sources 
 
Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
 
Senate Chair Brenner, House Chair Gramlich and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee. My name is John Cleveland. I am a resident of Auburn, a former State 
Senator from Auburn and former Mayor of Auburn. I am also a public water customer. 
I am writing to urge you to pass LD 1473 to protect public drinking water sources that 
have EPA waivers from filtration that are other wise required by the federal Clean Water 
Act. There are only 40 waivers from filtration in the United States and 9 of them are 
located in Maine. Lake Auburn is one of them. Lake Auburn is the drinking water source 
for the cities of Auburn, Lewiston, and parts of Poland, which provides drinking water to 
more than 40,000 customers. Lake Auburn has provided clean and healthy drinking 
water to the area for more than 100 years. 
Lake Auburn and other drinking water sources that do not require filtration are an 
essential and important asset to the health, and economic prosperity of the communities 
they serve. Like all open water sources, they are under the threat of being degraded by 
pollution that will lower the quality of the water and result in the loss of their EPA waiver 
and therefore require expensive filtration.  
The greatest source of pollution is phosphorus run off in the watershed around the 
water source. Many scientific studies including of Lake Auburn have shown that 
development in the watershed is the greatest source of phosphorous run off.  The best 
way to reduce phosphorus run off is to limit development in the watershed and allow 
forest growth and natural vegetation to protect the water source from phosphorus 
pollution.  
LD 1473 therefore clarifies and amends LD 2003 to exempt unfiltered water sources in 
Maine from its provisions to permit additional development in their watersheds. This 
common-sense amendment protects essential unfiltered drinking water sources from 
expensive filtration requirements while still providing for additional and extensive 
housing development opportunities throughout the State. For Lake Auburn alone 
preliminary estimates to construct a filtration facility are $40MM to $50MM plus an 
annual operating cost of $2MM to $3MM. It is estimated that these costs could easily 
double the water bill for all customers.  
I strongly urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1473 when the vote is taken to 
Protect Certain Unfiltered Drinking Water Sources.
