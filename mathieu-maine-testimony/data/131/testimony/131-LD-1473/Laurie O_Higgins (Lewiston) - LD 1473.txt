Laurie O'Higgins
Lewiston
LD 1473
My name is Laurie O'Higgins, and I have lived and worked in Lewiston Maine 
(where my husband and I live) for over thirty years.  We have raised our son here.
Prior to living in Maine, I have lived for years in the UK and in Ireland, spent a year 
in Berkeley, CA, and five years in Ohio.  Everywhere I lived before there were 
significant water rates, and, frankly, the water did not taste as good as it does here.  
As a runner, I drink a lot of it!
I am very anxious about the recent re-zoning of land within the Lake Auburn 
watershed, a decision over which I had no control, but which undoubtedly will affect 
the quality and price of water within the twin cities.  As a citizen and taxpayer, I urge 
passage of 1473, to protect our water.  Our community's clean water--and Lake 
Auburn is a shining example--should not be traded away for developments designed 
primarily to line the pockets of a very few.  There are environmentally more 
responsible ways of addressing our shortage of low cost housing.
