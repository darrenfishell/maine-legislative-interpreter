RE:
LD
1473,
An
Act
to
Protect
Certain
Unﬁltered
Drinking
Water
Sources
Dear
Sen.
Brenner,
Rep.
Gramlich
and
members
of
the
Environment
and
Natural 
Resources
Committee:
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
LD
1473.
This
bill
will
help
protect
bodies
of
water
in 
Maine
that
possess
a
ﬁltration
waiver.
This
includes
Lake
Auburn,
which
supplies
the 
drinking
water
for
Lewiston.
While
housing
is
a
paramount
concern,
we
need
to
prioritize
watershed
protection. 
Additional
development
in
the
land
surrounding
the
lakes
that
provide
our
drinking
water 
is
shortsighted.
Construction
of
any
kind
will
result
in
destruction
of
natural
growth
and 
an
increase
in
human
activity
and
impervious
surfaces
that
will
inevitably
lead
to
lake 
runoff.
This
runoff
will
aid
the
growth
of
algae
contributing
to
a
decrease
in
water
quality. 
Over
time,
this
will
create
the
need
for
a
ﬁltration
plant.
The
best
time
to
protect
our
natural
resources
is
now.
A
proactive
approach
is
necessary 
to
avoid
the
surprise
of
a
community
losing
their
ﬁltration
waiver
and
the
subsequent 
requirement
of
building
an
expensive
ﬁltration
plant
with
considerable
ongoing
operating 
costs.
I
appreciate
Senator
Margaret
Rotundo
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committee’s
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
