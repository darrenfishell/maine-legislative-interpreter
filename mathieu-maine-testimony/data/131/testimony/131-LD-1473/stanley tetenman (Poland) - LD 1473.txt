LD 1473
Testimony in support of 
LD 1473 “An Act to Protect Certain Unfiltered Drimking Water Sources”
May 1, 2023
LD 1473 is necessary to support clean drinking water in Maine communities.
Maine is fortunate to have nine waivers of filtration for public drinking water sources.
There are only 39 of these waivers allowed in the country.  LD 1473 will exempt the 
sensitive water sheds in these nine areas from additional development from legislation
passed in the last session.
Allowing more development in these nine watersheds may cause deterioration of 
these water supplies which will lead to the revocation of these waivers.  This would 
necessitate the building and maintenance of filtration systems.  These systems will 
cost multimillions of dollars to build and maintain.  These nine public water supplies 
have some of the lowest user costs in the state.  If filtration systems have to be built 
and maintained, the users costs may double.
An exemption from increased development in these watersheds will not affect 
increased development outside of these areas.  The exemptions of these areas will 
prevent an unneccesary cost increase to users.
There are already increased threats to these public water supplies from climate change
and other sources which we cannot immediately control.  LD 1473 is a threat we can 
and should control.
Some parts of Poland are connected to the Auburn Water District.  Our users would 
be directly affected by the necessity of having an expensive filtration system installed.
Please vote to support ld 1473.
Thank you.
