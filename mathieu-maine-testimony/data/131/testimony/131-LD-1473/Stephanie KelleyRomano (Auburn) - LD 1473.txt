RE: Testimony in support of LD1473: An act to Protect Certain Unfiltered Drinking 
Water Sources
My name is Stephanie Kelley-Romano and I live in Auburn Maine, and work at Bates
College, in Lewiston Maine. 
I am writing as a engaged and intelligent citizen urging you to vote "ought to pass" on
LD1473.
I have been working with the "We Protect Lake Auburn" community group for the 
past year, and frankly have been shocked at the amount of politicking going on 
around this issues.  Everyone has a right to clean, affordable water.  Just because 
climate change "may someday" require us to build a filtration system is no reason to 
simply give up on protecting and serving this earth.  
Maine is a unique and beautiful state -- it is important we keep clean drinking water 
affordable for our residents.  I've seen that if we lose our waiver, our rates will likely 
more than double. As a single mom, and homeowner this would be a legit issue for 
me -- and I am not even close to the most vulnerable of our citizens!! 
Please support this -- we need protection for the lake so that everyone can have clean 
water.  The watersheds need to be protected until we can discern the best course 
forward for our residents.  I know at least at Lake Auburn the science backs 
conservation rather than development. So please vote "ought to pass."
