LD 1473
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the ENR Committee:
I represent no agency or entity other than myself and write testimony in support of LD
1473.
We have barely scratched the surface of the unintended negative impacts associated 
with LD2003 that will be coming to a community, and water sources, near you. The 
unilateral tripling of density and driving up the phosphorous loads around our 
valuable and precious water sources by the State has always been a risk and will be an
even greater risk that this LD2003 law did not acknowledge or properly prevent.
The invisible 100 foot shoreland buffer will not take care of everything, as it is not an 
impenetrable and flawless defense to urban sprawl and development.
I urge the committee to vote OUGHT to PASS on LD1473.
Thank you.
Dan
