RE:
LD
1473,
An
Act
to
Protect
Certain
Unfiltered
Drinking
W ater
Sources
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1473,
An
Act
to
Protect
Certain
Unfiltered
Drinking
W ater
Sources,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Maine
has
exceptional
water
quality ,
benefiting
Maine
people
and
wildlife.
Our
clean,
clear ,
cold
waters
support
the
iconic
Common
Loon,
the
last
stronghold
in
the
eastern
United
States
for
wild
brook
trout,
and
the
only
population
of
endangered
Atlantic
Salmon.
These
same
waters
benefit
Maine
people
in
a
multitude
of
ways,
including
as
public
drinking
water
sources.
Nine
waterbodies
in
Maine
(of
only
40
across
the
country)
are
of
such
quality
that
the
federal
Environmental
Protection
Agency
has
granted
them
filtration
waivers.
As
a
result,
benefiting
communities
do
not
need
to
invest
in
expensive
water
filtration
infrastructure.
The
quality
of
these
water
bodies
is
threatened
by
intensive
development
within
their
watersheds.
Important
legislation
enacted
by
the
130th
Maine
Legislature
(LD
2003)
might
have
the
unintended
consequence
of
encouraging
intensive
development
in
these
watersheds,
perhaps
resulting
in
deteriorating
water
quality
and,
as
a
result,
the
need
for
water
filtration
infrastructure.
LD
1473
would
exempt
watersheds
with
filtration
waivers
from
the
allowances
for
additional
development
resulting
from
LD
2003.
Maine
Audubon
believes
this
is
a
common-sense
approach
to
preserving
water
quality ,
as
well
as
a
cost-saving
measure
for
impacted
communities.
W e
ur ge
the
Committee
to
support
this
bill.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
