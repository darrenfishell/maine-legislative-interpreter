LD 1473
Please pass LD1473 to protect unfiltered water sources from becoming endangered by
pollution which would then require a financial burden on residents of such 
municipalities required to purchase a filtration system. Developers are eager to 
develop and sell 
Properties close to watershed areas by getting the municipalities to push the 
watershed bounderies closer to the lakes. Please pass LD 1473 to keep our Maine 
lakes' public drinking water safe for this and our next generations.
