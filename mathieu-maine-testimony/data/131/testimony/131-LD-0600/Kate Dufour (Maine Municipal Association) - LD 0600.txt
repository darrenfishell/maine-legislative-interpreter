In Support of  
LD 600, An Act to Expand Availability of Naloxone Hydrochloride   
 
April 3 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in support of LD 600 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Associat ion’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Local leaders  appre ciate th at LD 600 leaves it to municipalities to decide whether it is 
appropriate and necessary to  implement a program making naloxone  hydrochloride available  in 
public buildings , and explicitly  provid es immunity f rom criminal  and civil liability . What is most 
troubling about the bill , is not th e permission granted in LD 600, but that the opioid  crisis is so 
rampant across the state that a response of this nature, akin to making  AED s available  in public 
places, is necessary.   While this is a good first step,  municipal  officials recognize  that more 
needs to be done to ensure  that those struggling  with substance  use disorders have access to  
necessary care and recovery options .  
Despite the bill’s permissive , rather than mandatory , approach  municipal leaders remain 
concern ed with  the unintended consequences . It is for this reason  that t he Association e ncourage s 
members of the committee to contemp late how best to move  LD 600 forward and provide 
communities with the guid ance and resources  necessary to successfully  implement the proposal  
without risk to the  municipality  or its property  taxpayers.  
Thank you for considering the municipal  perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions  about the Association ’s position  on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 1 -
