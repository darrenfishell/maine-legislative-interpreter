Re:
L.D.
600,
An
Act
to
Expand
Availability
of
Naloxone
Hydrochloride
Dear
Sen.
Baldacci,
Rep.
Meyer
and
Members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services 
Committee:
As
the
mayor
of
Lewiston,
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
this
bill.
The
language 
solves
the
legal
dilemma
regarding
liability
that
prevents
us
from
locating
Naloxone
within 
city
hall
and
other
municipal
buildings.
The
ability
to
have
Naloxone
available
is
both
practical
and
symbolic.
It
allows
ready 
access
to
a
drug
that
is
proven
safe
and
effective
to
reverse
the
effects
of
a
fatal
overdose 
and
it
sends
the
message
that
Lewiston
is
a
recovery
ready
community.
I
appreciate
Representative
Margaret
Craven
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committeeâ€™s 
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
