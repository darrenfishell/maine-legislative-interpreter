“ A n

Hy dr ochloride ”
Good
morning
Senat or
Baldacci,
Repr esentativ e
Me y er ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Ser vices.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
600,
“ An
Act
t o
Expand
A v ailability
of
Nalo x one
Hy dr ochloride. ”
My
community
of
Lewist on
has
a
high
r ate
of
substance
use
disor der
and
the
a v ailability
of
nalo x one
has
been
critical
t o
r esponding
t o
o v er doses
and
sa ving
liv es.
I
know
many
people
who
carr y
nalo x one
with
them
e v er ywher e,
and
I
k eep
nalo x one
near
both
entr ances
t o
my
house
because
I
ha v e
personally
witnessed
o v er doses
on
my
str eet.
T ri-County
Mental
Health
Ser vices
has
also
installed
opioid
o v er dose
emer gency
r esponse
kits
called
“Nalo xBo x es”
at
se v er al
locations
in
the
ar ea,
but
we
still
do
not
ha v e
any
a v ailable
in
municipal
buildings,
due
t o
city
oﬃcials’
concerns
about
liability .
Access
t o
nalo x one
in
municipal
spaces
is
especially
impor tant
her e
because
we
ha v e
a
lar ge
unhoused
population,
many
of
whom
struggle
with
substance
use
disor der .
W e
also
ha v e
v er y
limited
shelter
options,
including
nothing
a v ailable
during
the
da ytime,
which
means
that
our
public
libr ar y
and
city
hall
ar e
the
de
fact o
warming
centers.
This
bill
would
explicitly
addr ess
the
city ’ s
liability
concerns
and
mak e
it
possible
t o
expand
access
t o
this
lif e
sa ving
medicine.
Please
v ote
Ought
T o
P ass
on
LD
600.
Thank
y ou
for
y our
time
and
for
y our
ser vice
t o
our
state.
