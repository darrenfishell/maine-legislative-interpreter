 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly in support of  
 LD 600, An Act to Expand Availability of Naloxone Hydrochloride 
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
 Good morning Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the Health  
 and Human Services Committee. My name is Mor gan Rielly , and I represent House District 127,  
 which includes part of W estbrook. I am here today in support of   LD 600, An Act to Expand  
 Availability of Naloxone Hydr ochloride.  
 Naloxone hydrochloride, also referenced as naloxone, is a medication approved by the Food and  
 Drug Administration which is used to rapidly reverse opioid overdose. It has the ability to  
 reverse the ef fects of opioids including heroin, morphine and oxycodone.  
 This bill allows an overdose prevention program, with consent of a municipality , to provide and  
 maintain naloxone in a visible and publicly accessible area to be used by members of the public  
 in response to an opioid-related overdose. The bill also provides immunity from criminal and  
 civil liability to municipalities and overdose prevention programs for providing or maintaining  
 the naloxone in a public space.  
 According to the Maine Drug Data Hub, between 1997 and 2021, 5,423 residents of Maine have  
 died due to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drug overdoses. More recently , drug deaths  
 are being driven by fentanyl lethality , both in Maine and across the nation, which is leading to an  
 increase in drug overdoses and fatalities.  
 According to the Maine Monthly Overdose Report, 10,1 10 overdoses were reported in Maine in  
 2022, resulting in 716 suspected or confirmed deaths. In December 2022 alone, 928 people in  
 Maine experienced a drug overdose, with 75 suspected or confirmed deaths. In January 2023,  
 744 fatal and nonfatal overdoses were reported, 184 of which were reversed by community  
 intervention.

 Not everything is dismal, though. By November 2020, Maine had purchased and distributed  
 55,788 doses of naloxone through public health and harm reduction or ganizations, which  
 resulted in 1,136 opioid overdose reversals during the period of January through November  
 2020.  
 We know that naloxone saves lives 93% of the time that it is used. If we have the tools that allow  
 us to save lives, we should use them.  
 Thank you for your consideration.
