Good
afternoon,
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Judiciary.
My
name
is
Anna
Boucher
and
I
am
a
second-year
law
student
at
the
University
of
Maine
School
of
Law.
I
am
a
life-long
Mainer
and
upon
graduation
I
hope
to
practice
law
in
Maine.
I
am
here
today
to
present
testimony
in
opposition
to
L.D.
1352,
An
Act
to
Remove
Barriers
to
Becoming
a
Lawyer.
Justice
Antonin
Scalia
once
said,
“More
important
than
your
obligation
to
follow
your
conscience,
or
at
least
prior
to
it,
is
your
obligation
to
form
your
conscience
correctly.”
This
obligation
is
taken
seriously
by
law
school
students
as
we
endeavor
to
understand
the
legal
system
and
our
role
in
it.
Throughout
the
three
years
of
law
school,
a
law
student's
perspective
is
continually
challenged
and
changed
as
we
are
taught
to
think
critically
about
a
variety
of
issues.
This
is
necessary
in
order
for
the
individual
to
become
a
skilled,
reasoned,
and
effective
representative
for
their
clients.
The
core
curriculum
in
the
first
year
of
law
school
is
made
up
of
civil
procedure,
contracts,
torts,
property,
constitutional
law,
criminal
law,
and
most
importantly ,
legal
research
and
writing.
Intense
study
is
required
in
these
subject
areas
so
that
a
law
student
can
become
a
well-rounded
lawyer.
Legal
research
and
writing
is
most
important
because
our
writing
is
what
is
reviewed
by
courts
and
lays
the
basic
foundation
for
our
arguments.
To
leave
this
critical
component
of
a
legal
education
to
a
supervising
attorney
who
likely
does
not
have
the
time
or
resources
to
delve
deeply
into
how
an
effective
legal
argument
can
be
crafted
will
set
future
clients
up
for
failure
and
perpetuate
bad
lawyering
in
our
state.
I
believe
that
a
law
school
education
is
vital
to
a
practitioner ’s
success
as
an
attorney.
That
said,
I
also
recognize
the
need
for
more
lawyers
in
our
state,
especially
with
our
overcrowded
dockets.
However,
this
legislation
is
not
the
way
to
fix
this
problem.
The
four
states
that
participate
in
a
legal
apprenticeship
program
have
far
more
stringent
requirements
than
this
bill
contemplates.
For
instance,
Vermont’s
law
office
study
program
requires
that
apprentices
study
twenty-five
hours
per
week
for
four
years
alongside
an
attorney,
as
compared
with
this
bill's
mere
eighteen
hours
per
week
for
only
two
years.
1
California
also
requires
the
apprentice
to
study
for
four
years,
and
in
addition
pass
the
First-Year
Law
Students’
Examination
after
completing
their
first
year
of
study
which
covers
the
core
legal
courses
described
above.
2
Additionally ,
Virginia
requires
an
apprentice
to
complete
twenty-five
hours
per
week
for
three
years
under
the
supervision
of
a
member
of
the
bar
who
has
been
in
good
standing
for
at
least
ten
years.
3
Lastly,
Washington
requires
the
apprentice
to
work
a
minimum
of
thirty-two
hours
per
week
for
four
years
and
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
law
clerk,
including
a
combination
of
work
and
study.
4
All
of
these
states
require
the
individual
to
complete
the
aforementioned
training
before
being
able
to
sit
for
the
bar
exam.
I
feel
it
is
critical
to
note
that
simply
passing
the
bar
exam
does
not
make
one
a
good
attorney.
While
it
is
important
that
a
law
student
has
the
knowledge
base
that
the
bar
exam
requires,
passing
the
bar
exam
does
not
magically
transform
the
test-taker
into
a
competent
practitioner .
Rather,
the
skills
learned
and
developed
throughout
law
school
are
what
teach
a
student
to
read,
research,
write,
and
craft
arguments
that
win
the
day
in
court
and
provide
justice
for
Mainers.
Criticism
is
easy,
but
solutions
are
difficult.
With
that
in
mind,
I
do
have
some
recommendations
for
how
Maine
can
reduce
barriers
to
entry
into
the
legal
profession.
One
way
would
be
to
follow
the
Wisconsin
model
and
allow
diploma
privilege
in
Maine.
5
Diploma
privilege
would
allow
graduates
of
the
University
of
Maine
School
of
Law
to
secure
a
license
and
practice
law
in
Maine
without
taking
the
bar
exam.
Additionally ,
the
Maine
Legislature
could
work
with
the
existing
legal
aid
clinics
at
the
University
of
Maine
School
of
Law
to
fund
clinics
in
parts
of
the
state
and
in
practice
areas
with
backlogged
dockets.
This
would
allow
our
student
attorneys
to
gain
experience
by
practicing
law
and
provide
Mainers
with
access
to
critical
legal
services
while
alleviating
the
burden
on
the
courts.
I
cannot
stress
enough
how
important
a
legal
education
is
to
upholding
the
foundations
of
the
law
in
our
state.
Quantity
should
never
be
elevated
over
quality
when
it
comes
to
the
practice
of
law.
The
stakes
for
individuals
facing
the
legal
system
are
simply
too
great.
