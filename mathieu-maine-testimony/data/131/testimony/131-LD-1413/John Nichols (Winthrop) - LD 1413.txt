 Title 36 Chapter 908-B Sec.4    § 6281 Sub-§1 B3
To The Chairs and Members of the Committee
Comment; 
If the intent of Stabilization legislation is to allow seniors to remain in their homes, I 
believe this section of the proposal needs reconsideration. There should be some 
provision to allow for the death of one "married" household member, such that the 
remaining member does not suddenly lose their stabilization rights by "becoming 
single."
If a couple's retirement income is over $60,000 but less than $120,000 and if the 
retirement benefits of one member are shared with the other by a continuation of a 
benefits clause, the remaining income could still be more than $60,000.
An assumption that the expenses of a surviving spouse are less may not hold up. 
Medical expenses might drop for the survivor, but on the other hand, that survivor 
may have the greatest expenses to begin with. The survivor might have to pay for 
transportation if they depended on their partner for transportation.
Food expenses might drop, but again transportation could be an issue. Our appetites 
usually decrease as we age, and the difference between feeding one versus two is 
minimal. In addition, the survivor may lack meal preparation skills and have to 
purchase more expensive ready-made meals or travel eat in restaurants.
Other tasks may fall to the member who never had the ability to perform them and 
require hiring workers. For example, at 84, I run the snowblower and shovel in the 
winter, mow lawns in the summer, and do other tasks my wife could not perform. 
However, the fact that I can do such things doesn't mean I would be the survivor.
Home insurance, utilities, and heating expenses would remain the same. Repairs to an
already aging home may actually increase.
There may be other examples I haven’t thought of, but the concept remains the same.
 Sincerely, John Nichols, Winthrop
