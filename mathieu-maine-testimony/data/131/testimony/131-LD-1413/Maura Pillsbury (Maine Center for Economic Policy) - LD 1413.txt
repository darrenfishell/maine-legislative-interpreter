Testimony in Support of LD 1413, An Act to Amend the Laws Establishing a Property Tax  
Stabilization Program for Senior Citizens  
April 1 2, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative  Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is 
Maura Pillsbury and I am an analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am submitting 
this testimony  in support of LD 1413 . We support ending the property tax stabilization 
program because it is not  sufficiently targeted toward its goal of keeping older Mainers in their 
homes . However, if you choose to leave the program in place,  we believe adding means testing 
is the best option  for improving it. To that end, LD 1413  would:  
 
• limit the benefits of th e Property Tax Stabilization Program  to those  with income  up to 
$60,000 for individuals and $120,000 for married couples  
• index these income limits to inflation  
• clarify that recipients would have to reapply if they change residence  
 
We would also encourage you to : 
• add a n income  limit for Mainers filing as head of household  
• consider even lower income eligibility thresholds  
• include asset limits  
 
By establishing income limits, this bill  would  better  direct  the program’s benefits to those who 
need them most. A lower income threshold would be even more effective . Due to Maine’s high 
personal exemption and standard deduction, along with other available credits and 
deductions , those  making  total  income  well over $60,000  (single) /$120,000  (married)  befo re 
adjustments will be able to access this credit.  Lower ing the income threshold even further 
would help better  direct benefits to Mainers with low and middle income.  By narrowing 
eligibility  this bill will  also reduce the fiscal impact of the existing property tax freeze program, 
which is expected to balloon rapidly and cost the state tens of millions of dollars each year. The 
rising cost of this program could put funding for other important state priorities in jeopardy.  
 
This bill  also addresses an issue with the program that allows recipients to maintain their  
property tax freeze even if they move to a more expensive property or a community with 
higher taxe s by clarify ing that they must r eestablish eligibility for their new residence.   
 
As we have testified previously , Maine’s  current Property Tax Stabilization Program misses the 
mark at addressing th e hardship s Mainers are facing  due to rising costs . There is no question 
that older Mainers with low income are struggling to afford the basics including housing and 
property taxes . But t his program shower s much of its benefits on economically secure seniors 
while having little benefit for seniors who are struggling to afford their property tax bills today. 
 
   
 Based on analysis we requested from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the top 20 
percent of Maine income earners who qualify for th e existing  program will receive almost 40 
percent of the be nefits. This bill would refocus t hese benefits  on the bottom 80 percent of 
households.  MECEP has prepared a table , included at the end of this testimony , showing  how 
benefits  under the current program  are disproportionately targeted  to those with higher 
property values.  
 
All older Mainers deserve access to safe and affordable housing, without the fear of being 
unable to pay their bills or losing their home as they age. Reducing the costs of 
homeownership can help older Mainers with l ow income become more housing secure. We 
agree this is an important priority. But freezing the property taxes of Mainers with means to 
pay them transfers these costs to other Mainers and is the wrong approach. If you decide to 
keep this program, we urge yo u to support income and asset limits.

i Not accounting for local certified ratio (difference in state and local valuation) . Depending on the difference 
between state and local property valuation, the homestead exemption may be less than $25,000. See Maine 
Revenue Services website on the homestead exemption for more information. 
https://www.maine.gov/revenue/faq/homestead -exemption -program  
ii Equalized average state mil rate for 2021. There is wide variation among average mil rates , from 9.21 in Lincoln to 
18.18 in Aroostook. Property taxes are calculated using local mil rates, therefore this is an approximation.  See 
Maine Revenue Services webs ite on full value tax rates. https://www.maine.gov/revenue/taxes/property -
tax/municipal -services   
iii Mil rate changes will vary by  year and  municipality.  This is an example of what a 2% change in mil rate would look 
like. 
ivNot accounting for increases in valuation . Assumes 2% increase in mil rate each year.
