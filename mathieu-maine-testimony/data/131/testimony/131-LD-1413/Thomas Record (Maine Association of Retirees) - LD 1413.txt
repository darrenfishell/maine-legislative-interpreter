TESTIMONY OF THOMAS RECORD 
MAINE ASSOCIATION OF RETIREES 
NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
LD 1413, AN ACT TO AMEND THE LAWS ESTABLISHING A PROPERTY TAX STABILZITON 
PROGRAM FOR SENIOR CITIZENS 
PRESENTED TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TAXATON 
APRIL 12, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Peny, Members of the Committee, I am Thomas Record, Vice 
President of the Maine Association of Retirees (MAR) and testify today on its behalf. MAR is a nonproﬁt 
organization comprised of more than 12,000 public service retirees including retired educators, state 
employees, legislators, judges and retirees from participating local districts. 
As MAR has testiﬁed on previous bills, the Property Tax Stabilization Act which was enacted last 
year has proven very popular among our members. The vast majority of MAR members are of modest 
means. Their retirement incomes based on their public service do not come close to keeping up with 
inﬂation. They are looking for any way they can to limit their exposure to rising costs such as property 
taxes. 
We understand and appreciate the Committee ’s desire to take a holistic approach to the large 
number of bills before you regarding the Stabilization Act and the Homestead Exemption. MAR looks 
forward to your ongoing work regarding these topics. 
With respect to the merits of this bill, MAR has heard the criticism of the Property Tax Stabilization 
Act raised in prior hearings that some of Maine’s richest retirees can participate in the program. While this 
may be true, we would note that while MAR members are proud of their public service to the People of 
Maine, very few would consider themselves wealthy. 
Please advise if MAR can be of any assistance. Thank you.
