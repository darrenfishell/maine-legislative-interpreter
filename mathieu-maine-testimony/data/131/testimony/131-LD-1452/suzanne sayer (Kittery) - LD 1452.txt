LD 1452
Hello Senator Lawrence and esteemed members of the Energy Utilities and 
Technology Committee.
Thank you for allowing me to address you.   I am Dr.  Sayer.  I have a PhD in 
Engineering and Environmental geophysics, and a BSME both from VaTech.
  I do NOT SUPPORT LD 1452. - An Act to Require the Commissioners of the 
Public Utilities Commission to Be Popularly Elected.   I respectfully submit that the 
people of the Great State of Maine do not have the knowledge of the qualifications for
a Public Utilities Commissioner.   One of the reasons that the People are so upset with
the utilities is that they don't have enough knowledge to make smart decisions on how
to minimize their own energy use.  How are they to make a smart decision on electing
someone?  Electing someone is more subjective than making good choices about 
energy usage.
 I do not support LD 1452 An Act to Require the Commissioners of the Public 
Utilities Commission to Be Popularly Elected,  because I do not think elected officials
will have the expertise to do what needs to be done. It is a technical job and requires a
lot of knowledge and judgement.  People who tend to run for a public office are actors
and charismatic and don't normally have the patience to understand the intricaises of 
Public Utility work.
 I am Dr.  Sayer.  I have a PhD in Engineering and Environmental geophysics, and a 
BSME both from VaTech.  A Masters in Planetary Geochemistry from MIT as well as
a BS in Geological Sciences.   I took Electrical engineering courses both for my PhD 
and BSME.  I most recently worked as a Nuclear Engineer on Los Angeles class 
Attack submarines at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where I needed to understand some
electrical engineering.   I represent myself.   I was on the Utilities Subcommittee of 
the Ocean Energy Task Force.
