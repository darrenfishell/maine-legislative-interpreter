LD 1452
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the EUT,
I represent no entity or agency other than myself and would like to testify niehter for 
or against LD1452.
There is a terrible problem, the unchecked consolidation of power under one branch 
of government (PUC under the Executive Branch) which needs to be corrected. I just 
don't know the best way.
Maybe powerful out-of-state interests and untraceable money will influence our state 
PUC positioning, who knows, but more visibility and transparency through an 
election process should be helpful. Perhaps a political contribution and budget cap on 
candidates?
Right now it seems like there is absolutely no way to hold them accountable for PUC 
member inactions or actions, until waiting a few gubernatorial cycles have past to 
maybe see change (which is too long).
I urge the Committee to investigate removing this consolidated power from the 
Executive Branch, not sure if LD1452 is the best way to do it, but at least it allows 
that discussion to happen.
Thank you.
Dan
