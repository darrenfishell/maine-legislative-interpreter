LD 1452
Hello Senator Lawrence and Honored members of the Energy, Utilities and 
Technology joint legislative committee.  I am Dr. Sayer, a retired Nuclear engineer.  I 
have a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute and State University(also known as Virginia Tech) and a Doctorate in 
Philosophy in Engineering and Environmental geophysics from VaTech.  My earlier 
degrees were a Masters in Earth and Planetary Sciences (Geochemistry) from 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a bachelors in science from Tufts 
University.   In My geophysics and engineering, my electives were in Electrical 
engineering and mathematics. 
I wish to testify against LD 1452 An Act to Require the Commissioners of the Public 
Utilities Commission to Be Popularly Elected. for the following reasons:
1) Electing commissioners will cost taxpayers money, litter up the roadways with 
non-recyclable plastic signs and metal wires.
2) Appointing commissioners for limited terms and having oversite of them by the 
EUT is less partisan.
3) the general public does not know what the Maine Public Utilites Commission does,
and they probably don't want to learn.  They just want reliable inexpensive electricity.
4) I've read the London Economics International report of Feb 15, 2020 and disagree 
with this one recommendation.
