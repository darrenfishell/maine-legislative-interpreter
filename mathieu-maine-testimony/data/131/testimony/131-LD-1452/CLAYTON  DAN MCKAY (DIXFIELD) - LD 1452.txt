Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
I would expect the voters of Maine do not follow the PUC as a rule. I do expect the 
audience the committee entertains during public hearings and work sessions do follow
the PUC and most of them are promoting everything that would make the PUC an 
agent for the renewable energy industry.
This bill is an underhanded effort to silence the wishes of the ratepayers in favor of 
the regular crowd of rent seekers that appear before your committee.
It would be sad if you give this bill serious consideration and a vicious slap in the face
to your constituents who are not seeing any purpose in accelerating the cost of energy.
It's time for you on this esteemed committee to pause and contemplate how this false 
narrative of climate change has manipulated your better judgement.
This bill guarantees the PUC will never again be an independent thinking agency, 
instead they will be reduced to a pack of lackies.
