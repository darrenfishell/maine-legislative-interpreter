Dear Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee Members,
Please support LD 1452 - An Act to Require the Commissioners of the Public 
Utilities Commission to Be Popularly Elected. 
Maine citizens should be able to elect officials that fill such important positions as 
these.  
Thank you for your time.
