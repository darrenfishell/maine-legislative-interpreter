Senator, District 20 Augusta, ME 04333 
Senator Eric Brakey 
Speaking On L.D. 1155, 
“An Act to Address Legislative Salaries ” 
Before the State and Local Government Committee 
Tuesday, April 25, 2023 
PROPOSED FORMULA FOR 
LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
For the purpose of establishing compensation for elected officials, indexed to the 
economic impact of policies established by those officials on the people of Maine, I have 
drafted this formula for a "Legislative Pay lndex." 
LP=l*(1.05-U)*(1+WM -WN)*1.10 
LP - Legislative Pay index (Annualized) 
l - Maine Median Income (Current: $3O.850) 
U - Maine Unemployment Rate (Current: 3.1%) 
This formula treats 5% unemployment, which economists regard as "full employment," 
as the baseline. When unemployment rises above 5%, LP will decrease. When 
unemployment falls below 5%, LP will increase. 
WM - Maine Workforce Participation Rate (Current: 58%) 
WN - National Workforce Participation Rate (Current: 62.4%) 
Since there is no recognized ideal rate for workforce participation, this formula 
measures Maine's rate against the national average. When participation falls below the
national average, LP will also fall. When participation rises above the national average, 
LP will also rise. 
Based on current rates for Maine's median income, unemployment, and work 
participation, LP would equal $33,057.20. That would be the annualized pay 
compensation for a rank-and-file state legislator. 
ln reality, law-makers are only paid when the legislature is in session. 
During the ﬁrst regular session (6 months), this would result in 12 payments of 
$1 ,377.38, and total annual pay of $16,528.60. (Current rates for 1st Regular Session 
Salary is $16,245.12). 
During the second regular session (4 months), this would result in 8 payments of 
$1,377.38, and total pay of $11,019.04. (Current rates for 1st Regular Session Salary is 
$11,668.32). 
According to existing rules, majority and minority leaders and assistant leaders are paid 
10% more than rank-and-file members. Additionally, the Speaker of the House and 
Senate President are paid 25% more than rank-and-file members. This would continue, 
using LP as the basis. 
Additionally, the Governor's pay could also be based on the LP Index, with a multiplier 
of 2.5, resulting in an annual salary of $82,642.50. 
From then on, to increase their own compensation, all elected ofﬁcials need to do is 
enact policies that result in higher pay, lower unemployment, and greater work 
participation for the people of Maine.
