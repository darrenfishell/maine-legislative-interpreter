Good afternoon, Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and distinguished 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government: 
I am State Representative David Woodsome, and I proudly represent 
District 139, Limerick, Parsonsfield, and a portion of Waterboro. It is an 
honor to appear before you today for the purpose of introducing L.D. 1155, 
“An Act to Address Legislative Salaries. ” 
This legislation proposes that starting with the 132“ Legislature, the 
salary of legislators would increase to $25,000 in the first year of each 
biennium and to $20,000 in the second year of each biennium. 
With Maine lawmakers last pay increase dating back to 1999, and the 
previous raise going further back to 1990, it is certainly time for us to 
consider how the current pay structure influences the ability for average 
citizens to serve. 
The demand placed upon legislators is no longer comparable to part—time 
employment, but is assuredly equivalent to a full~time job. Long days of 
hearings and floor work followed by meetings and communicating with 
constituents in the evening can often result in workdays in excess of 
12 hours. 
I do not believe any of us come to Augusta with the expectation of getting 
rich or with the desire to exploit the taxpayer through excessive earnings. 
Nevertheless, adjusting the current pay scale has its benefits. 
Many legislators are facing the same economic and financial 
challenges/problems as the general public in making ends meet. Increasing 
our annual salary may entice more citizens to run for office, thus widening 
the diversity of current representation. 
It is in the best interests of constituents that our own mental, 
emotional, and physical wellbeing not be overstrained and that our focus not 
be divided due to the demands of rising costs and stagnant compensation. 
What was a reasonable wage nearly a quarter century ago for legislators, I 
believe no one would argue is currently a justifiable amount. 
Thank you for your consideration.
