“An

Address
Legislative
Salaries”
Before
the
State
and
Local
Government
Committee
April
25,
2023
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover ,
and
Distinguished
Members
of
the
State
and
Local
Government
Committee,
I
am
writing
to
express
Maine
Conservation
V oters'
str ong
support
for
LD
1 155,
"An
Act
to
Address
Legislative
Salaries"
which
proposes
an
increase
in
the
salaries
of
Legislators
in
Maine.
As
the
Political
Director
of
Maine
Conservation
V oters,
I
am
proud
to
speak
on
behalf
of
our
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters
who
believe
that
making
conservation
and
climate
action
a
political
priority
is
crucial
for
our
state's
future.
W e
support
measures
that
make
Maine’ s
democratic
institutions
more
ef ficient,
secure,
and
accessible
and
oppose
those
that
do
not
achieve
that
profoundly
American
goal.
The
current
salary
for
Maine
Legislators
is
$10,815
in
the
first
year
and
$7,725
in
the
2nd
year
of
each
biennium
per
year ,
which
is
one
of
the
lowest
in
the
country .
This
low
salary
creates
a
barrier
for
many
individuals
who
would
like
to
run
for
of fice
but
are
unable
to
do
so
because
of
financial
constraints.
This
limits
the
diversity
of
our
elected
representatives
and
undermines
our
democracy .
By
increasing
the
salary
of
Legislators
to
$25,000
in
the
first
year
of
each
biennium
and
$20,000
in
the
second
year ,
we
can
make
running
for
of fice
more
accessible
to
a
wider
range
of
Mainers,
including
those
from
underrepresented
communities.
Additionally ,
increasing
the
salary
of
Legislators
would
help
to
ensure
that
elected
of ficials
are
compensated
fairly
for
the
time
and
ener gy
they
invest
in
their
work.
Legislators
are
responsible
for
shaping
the
policies
that
af fect
our
state
and
its
residents.
They
spend
countless
hours
in
committee
meetings,
researching
complex
issues,
and
meeting
with
constituents
to
understand
their
concerns.
Increasing
their
salaries
would
help
to
attract
and
retain
public
servants
who
are
committed
to
serving
their
constituents
and
making
a
positive
impact
in
our
state.
Finally ,
we
believe
that
increasing
the
salary
of
Legislators
is
an
issue
of
equity .
Many
potential
citizen
legislators
in
Maine
come
from
backgrounds
where
they
may
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
support
themselves
while
serving
in
of fice.
This
puts
them
at
a
disadvantage
and

perpetuates
inequities
in
our
political
system.
By
increasing
their
salaries,
we
can
create
a
more
level
playing
field
and
ensure
that
all
Mainers
have
the
opportunity
to
serve
their
communities
in
elected
of fice.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
strongly
ur ges
the
committee
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1 155.
This
is
an
issue
of
equity ,
accessibility ,
and
fairness
that
will
benefit
our
state
and
its
residents
in
the
long
run.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Respectfully ,
W ill
Sedlack
Political
Director ,
