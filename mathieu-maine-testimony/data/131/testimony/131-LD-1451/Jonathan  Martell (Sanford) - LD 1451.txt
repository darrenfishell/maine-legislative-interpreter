 
LD 1451 An Act to Prohibit State and Local Enforcement of Federal Firearms Laws 
  
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  May 8, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1451 An Act to Prohibit State and Local Enforcement of Federal Firearms Laws 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1451 An Act to Prohibit State and Local 
Enforcement of Federal Firearms Laws 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
This bill simply affirms the Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Maine law enforcement should not 
be assisting federal agencies with infringing on this right. Given the selective enforcement and ever changing 
patchwork of federal agencies interpretation of federal law, enforcement should be left to the resources they put 
into the matter.  
City and state law enforcement expends significant resources enforcing Maine law and providing needed 
services. Time taken for other tasks should be outside the scope of their duties, and also is against the oath of 
Honor to uphold the Constitution.  
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OATH OF HONOR 
 
 On my honor, 
I will never betray my badge, 
my integrity, my character,  
or the public trust. 
I will always have 
the courage to hold myself 
and others accountable for our actions. 
I will always uphold the constitution 
my community and the agency I serve. 
 
Please support Mainer's Constitutional Rights, by supporting this bill.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
