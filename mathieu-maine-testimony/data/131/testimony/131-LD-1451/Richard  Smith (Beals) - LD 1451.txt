LD 1451
Honorable committee members, 
I strongly believe that LD 1451 ought to pass, as this aligns both with my belief that 
Maine should become a 2nd Amendment sanctuary state, and my belief that cannabis 
users do not pose any credible threat that should preclude them from firearms 
ownership.
 
Thank you!
