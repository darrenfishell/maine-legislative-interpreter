LD 1451
I'm writing in support of LD 1451, "An Act to Prohibit State and Local Enforcement 
of Federal Firearms Laws."
The 10th Amendment to the US Constitution states that the powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to
the States respectively, or to the people. This defines our State Sovereignty.
The 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution states that a well regulated Militia, being 
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, 
shall not be infringed. Also, Article I, Section 16 of the Maine Constitution states that 
every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be 
questioned.
I find all gun control laws to be a violation of both Constitutions, but if we must have 
gun control laws, let's keep them local, not from a centralized federal government that
is detached from the ideals of State Sovereignty and individual liberty.
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1451.
Sincerely, James M Waite
