LD 1451
I oppose LD 1451, “An Act to Prohibit State and Local Enforcement of Federal 
Firearms Laws.” There are not enough federal law enforcement officials to enforce 
federal laws, so state and local and federal authorities must work together to ensure 
that the relatively few federal laws we have relating to firearms are in fact enforced. 
Tying the hands of state and local authorities when it comes to the enforcement of 
federal firearms laws would ensure that most federal laws would never be enforced 
for lack of law enforcement capability, making those laws ineffective and 
unenforceable. That is likely the intent of this bill, which is aimed at creating an 
environment where there is no regulation or oversight of firearms of any kind. Bills 
such as this make it nearly impossible to address the number one cause of death for 
American youth, which is firearms. This bill is dangerous and OUGHT NOT TO 
PASS.
