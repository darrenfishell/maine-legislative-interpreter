Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1772:
“An
Act
to
Require
Voter
Approval
of
Certain
Borrowing
by
Government-controlled
Entities
and
Utilities
and
to
Provide
Voters
More
Information
Regarding
That
Borrowing”
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1772
.
At
its
foundation,
LD
1772
would
require
greater
public
knowledge
and
oversight
of
when
a
public
or
quasi-public
entity
takes
on
massive
amounts
of
debt--specifically
in
excess
of
$1
billion.
In
order
to
accumulate
this
level
of
debt,
LD
1772
requires
that
the
question
simply
be
approved
by
voters.
Pursuant
to
this
vote,
it
would
require
the
Treasurer
to
“prepare
a
statement
to
accompany
the
question
presented
to
the
voters
regarding
the
estimated
costs
of
the
increased
debt.”
LD
1772
is
a
simple,
commonsense
proposal
that
could
save
Maine
voters
lots
of
potential
headaches
and
runaway
costs
from
complex,
expensive
proposals
enacted
at
the
ballot
box.
Please
deem
it
“Ought
To
Pass.”
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
