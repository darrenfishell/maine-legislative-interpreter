LD 403
Dear Senator Ingwersen and Representative Pluecker,
I would like to express my full support for passing LD 403.  
You will likely hear a decent amount of testimony from a very small faction of the 
Maine Harness Racing Community that they oppose this bill, but it is my heartfelt 
opinion that the opposition is presented by the group of people who currently benefit 
from the Maine Sire Stakes program and wish to continue to do so.  They will claim a 
number of grievances, but the bill before you contains none of those grievances. This 
bill in and of itself does not propose ANY programmatic changes, but only clears the 
path for any future changes to the Maine Sire Stakes program to be the sole discretion
of the Maine Harness Racing Commission, where nearly all other proposed changes 
within the harness racing industry currently reside.
Oddly enough, I have invested heavily in the Maine Sire Stakes program (I have eight
broodmares for Maine Sires, and I also recently purchased a premier trotting sire to 
stand in Maine), but I have done so with the commitment to making the program a 
much more widely successful and equitable venture that will invite a much wider base
of participating owners.
My commitment to the program is based on the primary idea that the Maine Breeders 
Stakes program should be a pipeline for injecting new, homegrown harness racing 
talent to race and compete in Maine not only for two brief years (2 and 3 year old 
season), but for another 10 years after their stakes seasons are over.  In order to 
promote this growth, LD 403 needs to pass.
Should the bill move to a workshop session, I hope that you will invite me to speak.  I
believe my heavy investment in the sire stakes program AND my full support of this 
bill would be of service in your deliberations.
I thank you for your time and service, and I wish you all good health and luck in this session.
