Testimony of (Vicki Wilcox, (Old Town Elementary School RSU 34)) 
In Support of LD 1527 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Vicki Wilcox). I am a resident of ( 
Old Town) I am an elementary school counselor in a prek-5 Elementary School. 
 
I am writing to support the community school program.  These grant funds support so 
many of our students and families.  We currently have a person running our school 
resource center, supporting our displaced and homeless populations because of this 
funding.  We have an above average level of poverty in Old Town and our families 
depend on these services.  This community school grant has also enhanced our 
school gardening program which in turn feeds many in our community.  I am 
concerned about funds drying up as the mental health of our students and families is 
at crisis proportions.   
  
1.  Schools support the whole child, while increasing student outcomes. 
 
2. Community Schools are committed to sustainability through the school gardening 
projects and partnering with our Community Food Cupboard and Good Shepherd. 
 
3.  We have a weekly backpack program where students bring snacks and non-
perishables for the weekends and vacations. 
 
 
 
 
- Our community school liaison works tirelessly providing supports to our struggling 
families. She works on finding suitable housing, food, gas cards and referrals to outside 
services. 
 
 
In closing, please consider keep these funds in place as our community deals with 
another mill closing and the end of many covid incentives and financial supports.  Our 
families are struggling with substance abuse, poverty, and mental health concerns just 
to name a few.  We need more resources to support our children.
