T estimony
of
Jennifer
Ladd,
Cape
Cod
Hill
Community
School,
RSU
9,
in
Support
of
LD
1527.
Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs.
My
name
is
Jennifer
Ladd.
I
am
a
resident
of
T emple
and
interim
principal
at
Cape
Cod
Hill
School
in
New
Sharon.
T oday ,
I’m
submitting
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1527
“An
Act
T o
Promote
the
Community
School
Program”
I
grew
up
in
New
Sharon
in
the
seventies
and
eighties.
Though
it
is,
on
one
hand,
heartening
that
the
town
remains
lar gely
unchanged;
it
is
concerning
that
many
of
the
same
challenges
families
faced
forty
to
fifty
years
ago
persist.
Medical
and
dental
care
exist
outside
the
immediate
area
and
the
lack
of
local
industry
creates
longer
commutes
for
working
parents,
that
is,
if
families
can
af ford
one
or
more
vehicles.
Furthermore,
within
the
last
five
years,
every
local
daycare
provider
completely
closed
up
shop.
In
my
short
time
as
interim
principal
of
this
small
school,
I
have
seen
the
positive
impacts
of
a
Community
School
strategy .
The
provision
of
no-cost
early
morning
and
after -school
care
supports
families
by
providing
enriching
activities
for
children
in
a
safe
environment.
Coordination
with
the
Good
Shepherd
Food
Bank
and
SNAP
(Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program)
of
Maine
means
families
have
access
to
nutritious
food
and
education
on
food
preparation
and
budgeting.
Passage
of
LD
1527
would
support
districts
in
adopting
the
Community
School
strategy
and
enhance
the
ef ficacy
of
existing
Community
Schools
as
they
provide
opportunities
for
students
to
thrive
by
supporting
“the
whole
child”,
thereby
improving
education
for
students
in
all
of
Maine’ s
locales.
Current
grant
funding
will
not
be
enough
to
sustain
Community
Schools
as
they
work
to
build
capacity
through
needed
staf fing.
Please
support
this
bill
as
it
is
an
investment
in
children,
families,
and
our
shared
future.
This
model
prevents
students
from
being
“left
behind”
because
of
their
address
or
socioeconomic
status.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
commitment
to
Maine’ s
children.
Respectfully ,
Jennifer
Ladd
Interim
Principal
Cape
Cod
Hill
Community
School
New
Sharon
