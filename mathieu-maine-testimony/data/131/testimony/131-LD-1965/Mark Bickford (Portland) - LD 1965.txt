Re: LD 1965, “An Act to Authorize the Secretary of State to Provide a New General Issue 
of License Plates” 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, 
My name is Mark Bickford and I am a resident of Portland.  I am sending you this message in 
hopes of improving upon the license plate design put forward by the Secretary of State ; 
specifically, regarding the design of the pine tree.  The bill to redesign the state flag, currently 
before the House with an Ought to Pass divided report, specifies that the pine tree should be 
“proper”, that is, colored like a real pine tree, presumably with a dark trunk and pine green 
branches.  I feel that the license plate should do likewise, rather than use the construction-paper 
cutout version of the tree that is the Secretary’s initial suggestion. The historic alternative 
included in her testimony could be a much more valid, and attractive, choice, and offer a 
smoother transition from the more-realistic chickadee, pine cone and tassel we currently have. I 
urge the committee to refine the proposal to choose a more “proper” design for the tree.
