Hello,
     A lot of people are hurting from the State covid lock down, lost jobs, rising costs 
of rent, gas and groceries.  People should not be made to buy new plates because the 
State wants a pretty plate with a new logo - even if its just a fee. If a persons present 
plate is old and needs to be replaced, they can be obtained at their closest DMV.  This
is just another example of government waste and making the citizens of Maine lives 
even harder. Thank you.  Katherine Rinfret, Hampden, Maine
