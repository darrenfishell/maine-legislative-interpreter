LD 1965
Thank you for allowing me to submit my written testimony in support of LD1965. I 
am wholeheartedly in favor of replacing the chickadee plate for all the reasons sited 
by the committee. I would ask, however, that the committee please reconsider the 
inclusion of the term “Vacationland,” as I’ve seen on the new plate design. 
While the "Vacationland” moniker was clever when it was first coined in the 1920s, I 
believe we’ve outgrown it. It no longer tells the whole story of our state and, if fact, 
does a disservice to the hundreds of businesses and industries that are helping to move
Maine forward -- biotech, aquaculture, the new Roux Institute, and UMO's advanced 
composite center, to name just a few. As the owner of a Maine-based, digital 
marketing agency, I have never once used "Vacationland" as a means of attracting an 
out of state client to our company. It actually makes my job harder because the 
perception — as reinforced by our current license plate — is that Maine’s great for 
vacationing, but does anyone really work here? 
I understand that the Transportation Committee is responsible for creating license 
plates that meet legal and safety standards. But those standards don’t have to be at 
odds with the opportunity of creating a message that positions Maine as more than 
just a haven for vacationers. In considering the tens of thousands of plates, and the 
millions of miles they're driven across the country, not exploring a new, more forward
looking statement would be an opportunity missed.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my comments.
