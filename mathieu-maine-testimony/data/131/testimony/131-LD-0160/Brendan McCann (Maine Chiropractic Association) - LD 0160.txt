Re: LD 160 
Dear Members of the Committee, 
Thank you, Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and esteemed members of the joint standing 
committee, on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services. My name is Dr. Brendan 
McCann. I am a chiropractor practicing in Cape Elizabeth, ME, commuting from my home in 
Newmarket, NH. I am speaking here today on behalf of the Maine Chiropractic Association in favor 
of LD 160. 
This bill amounts to good housekeeping, ensuring clarity, consistency and compliance in the way we 
talk about chiropractors. The bill's effect will keep chiropractors in compliance with language in 
federal law as they work with federally qualified systems and insurers as Chiropractic Physicians. 
Chiropractors are already practicing in hospitals as well as federally qualified health centers under 
that designation. 
Chiropractors receive contracts both as providers and consumers designating us as Chiropractic 
Physicians and although a plurality of states recognize that term, it has not yet been updated in 
Maine.
A common example I can provide comes from the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians, 
which has credentialed a number of Maine chiropractors as Certiﬁed Chiropractic Sports Physicians. 
While this post-graduate program is provided through several duly accredited colleges, and 
recognized globally including in the US Olympic programs, it is incompatible with the currently 
allowed language in Maine. This illustrates how the term is well-established, widely used, and needs 
to be added to I\/laine law. 
I'm pleased to answer any questions you might have about chiropractic practice, diagnosis and 
treatment, or our evolving role in the broader medical system. Thank you for your time. 
Respectfully, 
Brendan McCann, DC
