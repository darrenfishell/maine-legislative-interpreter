Testimony of Yasmin Vafa, Executive Director, Rights4Girls 
Maine Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
April 11, 2023 
Thank you, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee for taking the time to hear testimony on this important bill. My name is Yasmin Vafa 
and I am the Executive Director of Rights4Girls ——a national human rights organization based in 
Washington, DC. I am testifying today in support of LD 1435, An Act to Reduce Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation. 
At Rights4Girls, we work to end gender-based violence against marginalized young women and 
girls throughout the United States, including right here in Maine. Speciﬁcally, we work to change 
the policies that allow women and girls to be criminalized when they experience sexual violence, 
and promote policies that provide survivors with access to safety, justice, and support. We do so 
through advocacy, research, and training and technical assistance. In addition, I am a proud 
member of the federal Advisory Committee on the Sex Trafﬁcking of Children and Youth which 
provides national guidance, as Well as counsel to the U.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services on the nation’s response to human trafﬁcking. Furthermore, over the 
last several years, I have served as a judicial educator for the National Judicial Institute on 
Domestic Child Sex Traff1cking —a program I co-lead and helped design that has trained more 
than 1,000 judges throughout the country on how to promote alternatives to detention for survivors 
of commercial sexual exploitation. 
This week, Rights4Girls released a new report called Criminalized Survivors: Today ’s Abuse to 
Prison Pigeline for Girls. Our report highlights how survivors are often punished and pushed into 
the criminal justice system because of the violence and exploitation they endure. The Washington 
Post featured the report and noted how survivors of sexual exploitation and trafﬁcking were 
particularly vulnerable to this disturbing abuse to prison pipeline. 
This legislation works to end this troubling cycle by repealing the crime of engaging in prostitution. 
This is an important and necessary change for individuals in the sex trade--who are among the 
most marginalized in our community given that many i) have suffered childhood sexual abuse, ii) 
sell sex as a means of survival or coercion, and iii) experience extreme violence at the hands of 
both sex buyers and exploiters.

Criminalizing these women merely keeps them trapped in the industry and hinders their ability to 
exit by impeding their access to essential needs like housing, safe jobs, and other support for them 
and their families. LD 1435 ends this punishment, allowing survivors the chance to start a new 
path for them and their families. 
Importantly, LD 1435 solely repeals this crime for survivors —NOT their exploiters. This 
thoughtful approach ensures that only those who are unjustly criminalized for their own 
exploitation are being protected. LD 1435 is careful to maintain the laws against all other aspects 
of the commercial sex industry, ensuring that exploiters ’ actions remain strongly prohibited. 
There are other important provisions in the legislation as well, such as provisions recognizing the 
added vulnerabilities of children in the sex trade and those with disabilities and providing greater 
information about community resources and support services to assist survivors. 
Ultimately, we know that in order to effectively exit the industry and stay out, we must adopt 
policies that i) stop punishing victims, ii) clear survivors ’ records, and iii) provide them services. 
For these reasons, I ask you to please vote to pass LD 1435 and its complimentary bill, LD 
1436, An Act to Provide Remedies for Survivors of Commercial Sexual Exploitation 
scheduled to be heard later today which promotes both criminal record relief and the promotion of 
services. 
Please help end the abuse to prison pipeline for sex trade survivors in Maine. 
Thank you.

g REPORT | Criminalized Survivors: Today's Abuse to Prison Pipeline 
for Girls 
Yasmin Vafa and Rebecca Epstein 
April 2023 
Executive Summary 
The Georgetown lnitiative on Gender Justice & Opportunity and Rights4Girls jointly released 
a new report on the criminalization of girls who experience sexual violence. The report isa 
follow-up to our 2015 publication, The Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline: The Girls'$tory, which 
raised awareness of how girls who have experienced sexual violence are sent into the juvenile 
justice system, despite being child survivors. 
Our new release examines where the pipeline is today for girls in the wake of the Black Lives 
Matter movement, the #MeToo movement, and the pandemic —and found that we are not 
just allowing girls to fall through the cracks — we are still actively punishing victims, rather than 
helping them support and heal. Our report calls for systemic change to stop sexual abuse and 
end the criminalization and re-victimization of survivors. 
We highlight three of the most urgent pathways for girls who are pushed into the legal system 
as a direct result of their victimization: 
I Survivors of sex trafficking who are punished for prostitution or as traffickers 
themselves; 
I Survivors who harm their abusers in their attempts to escape or in self-defense; and 
I Survivors who report abuse to police, but are charged with filing false reports. 
We also discuss progress that has been made in law and policy at the state and federal levels to 
protect survivors of sexual violence, and provide guidance for further action. 
Since the launch of our original publication, the concept of the abuse to prison pipeline has 
spread widely, helping to shape the public narrative around women and girls’ incarceration. 
Since 2015, the Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline report has been cited in hundreds of peer- 
reviewed journals, law review articles, and reports, influencing laws, policies, and legislation 
designed to protect survivors and promote trauma-informed practices for victims of gender- 
based violence.
Key Findings: 
Progress in disrupting the pipeline has been made since 2015. Public awareness of the 
criminalization of survivors and the injustice of arresting child survivors of sex trafficking on 
prostitution and related charges, has especially increased. As a result, many states have 
enacted safe harbor laws and other legal reforms that mitigate punishment for trafficking 
survivors whose behavior stems from their abuse, including attempts at self-defense and 
escape. 
Despite this progress, the abuse to prison pipeline for girls has not ended. Bills introduced 
after our 2015 report have generally not resulted in meaningful laws, and implementation of 
laws that havebeen passed is sometimes stifled due to limitations in training, resources, and 
cross system communication. Lack of resources and alternatives can even result in the 
decision to detain survivors, justified by the paternalistic notion that putting children behind 
bars is the surest way to protect them. ln some of the most extreme cases, survivors are 
forced to resort to violence in order to escape or defend themselves against their adult 
exploiters, then face decades to life in prison, despite being child victims of crime. 
Police and even schools collude in girls’ criminalization. Law enforcement and educators, who 
are entrusted with authority over girls’ lives, perpetuate the pipeline by filing charges of false 
reporting, or suspending girls from school when they report instances of sexual abuse— 
effectively turning the very systems that girls turn to for help into mechanisms of 
punishment. These systems can also criminalize survivors when they fail to recognize status 
offenses like truancy and running away for what they are — signals of escaping abuse. 
Ultimately, girls and all youth who experience violence deserve to be met with support, 
safety, and healing. lt is our hope that through this report and the following guiding principles 
we can affect the systems and cultural change needed to end the harmful and unjust patterns 
of criminalization that punish survivors of gender violence for the abuse they experience and 
promote the more equitable treatment of girls. 
Calls to Action: 
1. Prevent Gender-Based Violence by investing in ending sexual assault and abuse. 
2. Decriminalize and Support Girls who have been Sexually Abused and End the 
Punishment of Children Who Act Against Abusers in Self-Defense. Laws must 
expressly prohibit the arrest of victims for offenses related to the sexual violence they 
have survived. 
3. End the "Credibility Discount" Against Girls and Hold Law Enforcement Accountable 
for Disregard of Abuse Claims by prohibiting the practice of filing false reporting 
charges against girls who report sexual abuse and robustly investigating claims and 
protecting survivors.
Address the Disproportionately High Rates of Sexual Abuse Against Girls with 
lntersectional Identities. Girls of color, girls with disabilities, LGBTOJ+ and gender 
expansive youth, immigrant girls, and other girls who experience adversity continue to 
experience sexual violence at disproportionate rates and are more likely to be blamed 
and punished for the abuse they have survived. While all children must be protected 
against gender-based violence, specific attention should be paid to children with 
multiple layers of identity that subject them to complex forms of discrimination. 
Ensure that Efforts to Address Gender-Based Violence Account for the Unique 
Experiences and Vulnerabilities of Adolescent Girls. Too often, adolescent girls are 
grouped in with adult women in research, law, and policy on gender-based 
violence. Young girls and adolescents should be examined separately in research and 
protected in ways that recognize their unique experiences.

”l\/ly spirit has been burned but still glows through 
the flames. Hear me roar, see me glow, and watch me 
grow.” 
hese are the words of Pieper Lewis, who, at 15 years old, was sold to a 37-year-old man. 
I Pieper’s statement was made in court; not as a plaintiff, a complainant, a survivor, or 
even a victim, but as a defendant. She was charged with first-degree murder of the man 
she killed after he drugged and repeatedly raped her over the course of three days while she 
faded in and out of consciousness. ‘ 
Pieper’s criminalization is just one example of the abuse to prison pipeline for girls, a cycle we 
identified in 2015—and, as this report establishes, still persists. in this cycle, girIs—especlally 
girls of color—-are punished for the gender-based violence they endure, sent into the prison 
system without access to critical support. 
The roots of this cycle reach far and run deep. Public systems, entrusted with authority over 
girls‘ lives, not only fail to protect the safety of survivors; they affirmatively criminalize them. 
This injustice is particularly egregious when viewed against the backdrop of the sheer scale 
of sexual violence against girls in the US: girls aged 16-19 are four times more likely than the 
general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. ’ And according to 
data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022, one in four women 
in the United States (26.8 percent, or 33.5 million) reported "completed" or attempted rape at 
some point in their lifetime. ” The Covid pandemic has served as an exacerbating factor, caus- 
ing marked increases in domestic violence ‘ and severity of child abuse.‘ 
These rates are even higher for women and girls of color,‘ resulting in inequitable patterns of 
impact.’ According to the Rape, Abuse, lncest National Network (RAINN), the nation's largest 
anti-sexual violence organization, Native girls run the highest risk of sexual violence of all 
girls. On average, Native people aged 12 and older experience 5,900 sexual assaults per year. 
They are twice as likely to be raped and/or sexually assaulted compared to all other racesl 
ethnicities. “ Meanwhile, theYouth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) revealed that 13.9 percent of 
Native Hawaiian high schoolers in that state reported that they had been forced to engage in 
sexual acts by someone they were dating within the past 12 months, compared to 6.8 percent 
of white high schoolers. ’ Black girls also face extremely high rates of sexual violence. Ujima, 
the National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community, reported that one in 
four Black girls are sexually abused before the age of 18. ln a study Ujima conducted on a na- 
tional sample of high school students, 11 percent of Black girls reported having been raped.‘° 
One cause of the high rates of sexual violence against girls of color—as well as the dispropor- 
tionate degree of punishment imposed on them in response to that violence —is the adults 
who dehumanize them. In previous reports, we have documented the distorted lens through 
which adults view Black girls, perceiving them as older than white girls of the same age, more 
promiscuous, and undeserving of the same protection." Further, we have exposed a pattern 
of disproportionate sexual exploitation of girls of color by white men, as well as inequitable 
rates of arrests on prostitution charges." 
To elevate awareness of the criminalization of survivors, our organizations, together with 
the Ms. Foundation, published The Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline: The Gir/s’Storyin 
2015," which highlighted the hidden pattern that routes survivors like Pieper-who are often 
girls of color—into the legal system despite the fact that they present little, if any, risk to 
public safety.“ 
Since that time, the concept of the abuse“ to prison pipeline for girls has spread widely, 
influencing policy, research, and the public narrative —most notably championed by 
President Obama in 2015.The SexuaIAbuse to Prison Pipeline report has been cited in 
hundreds of peer-reviewed journals, law review articles, and reports; and it has been refer- 
enced in support of legislation and policies designed to decriminalize sun/ivors and increase 
the use of trauma-informed practices and community-based programs for survivors of 
gender-based violence. “
Subsequent research, too, has produced findings that substantiate the correlation between 
girls’ and women's experience of sexual violence and their involvement in the legal system." 
This body of work points to the need for a range of further studies, including examinations of 
the specific factors at play in the cycle, as well as the pipeline ‘s effects on subgroups of girls 
and women.“ 
The press has also widely recognized the abuse to prison pipeline in the wake of our report. 
Articles about gender-based violence have increasingly questioned why girls who have histo- 
ries of sexual victimization are sent into the prison system“ and shined a light on the harms 
of incarcerating survivors. ” 
These developments have taken place against a cultural backdrop that has changed con- 
siderably since our report was published. Seismic points of inflection include the rise of the 
Black Lives Matter movement, the Covid pandemic, the #MeToo movement, and the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, ” which eliminated the 
constitutional right to abortion. 
Of these touchpoints, the rise of the #MeToo movement has been uniquely influential in 
expanding mainstream recognition of the prevalence of sexual violence against women and 
girls, challenging conventional biases against claims of sexual abuse and prompting us to do 
better in hearing, believing, and supporting survivors. As more and more women and girls 
have publicly acknowledged their survivorship, the hashtag #MeToo has stood for a move- 
ment to end the nation's complicity in perpetuating sexual harassment and abuse.” 
Although the #MeToo movement continues to evolve, its focus has changed from the original 
intent, which was to provide safe spaces for women and girls of color to connect and heal 
from sexual violence. ” Its explosion into the mainstream was marked by increased attention 
to the experiences of affluent white women—a focus that persisted despite the'disproportion- 
ately higher rates of sexual violence against girls and young women of color." Tarana Burke, 
the founder of #MeToo, recognized this phenomenon as part of a historical pattern, noting 
that "sexual violence knows no race, class, or gender—but the response to it does.”25 
ln light of the changes that have taken place since the publication of our 2015 report, we set 
out to examine the current state of the pipeline for girls. Here, we provide new analyses of the 
most significant paths that funnel sun/ivors into the system, points of progress made in law 
and policy reform, and the challenges that persist. Finally, we offer a set of principles to guide 
systemic change. 
Solutions are possible, if only we choose to act.The top priority must be the prevention of 
gender-based violence itself. But as long as that violence persists, we must end the criminal- 
ization of victims.Through systemic, structural change, we can achieve justice for sun/ivors.
‘ 
espite clear evidence and increasing awareness of the prevalence of gender-based 
violence, girls are still pushed into the legal system in three main ways as a direct result 
of the violence they experience: 
Girls are blamed and criminalized for being sex trafficked; 
Girls are criminalized for acting in self-defense against abusers; and 
Girls are punished or criminalized for reporting abuse. 
These categories are not intended to represent an exhaustive list of all routes into the system 
for survivors of gender-based violence. As we highlighted in our original report, there are 
many other unique pathways into the system for girls, such as the criminalization of status of- 
fenders who run away from home to escape abuse or are forced to be truant because they are 
being sex trafficked.We highlight the three paths above as among the most urgent to address. 
Girls are Blamed and Criminalized for Being SexTrafficked 
Awareness of the prevalence of child sex trafficking and the injustice of criminalizing survivors 
has grown tremendously in recent years. Arrests of children on charges related to prostitution 
and "commercialized vice”"‘ have declined at rates that exceed the decline in total juvenile 
arrest rates."ln addition, thanks to the leadership of survivors, use of the term child pros- 
titute—itself a legal oxymoron, since children cannot legally consent to sex—has begun to 
wane in recent years.“ ln an influential development, the Associated Press revised its Style- 
book—-the foundational guideline for journalists and other writers on language, usage, style, 
spelling, and punctuation- —to discourage use of the term when referring to child victims of 
sexual exploitation. ” This trend, as well as the legal reforms we detail in the next section, are 
helping re-shape perceptions of child survivors in ways that are more legally accurate and 
ethically just. 
Yet the criminalization of child survivors continues.The US Department of Justice has report- 
ed that 110 children were arrested nationwide on prostitution charges and commercialized vice 
in 2020,” but local reports indicate that number is a vast underestimate? ‘ ln states that report 
a reduction in arrests of children related that to prostitution, survivors may simply be arrested 
on different charges—a practice known as proxy or masking charges”-including loitering; 
trespass; drug possession; or status offenses, such as truancy or running away.“3These arrests 
are ovenrvhelmingly of girls: in 2019, 71 percent of youth arrested on charges of prostitution 
and commercialized vice were girls, far exceeding their proportion of the population. ‘“The 
arrests are also disproportionately of Black youth: According to the US Department of Jus- 
tice, in 20l9—the latest year for which data has been released —Black children were over five 
times more likely to be arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice than white children. 
Overall, children of color were over_three and a half times more likely to be arrested on these 
charges than white children. “_ 
As we emphasized in our original report, the arrest and criminalization of child sex trafficking 
victims, whether on prostitution charges or other charges related to their exploitation, is both 
ethically and legally wrong. Under federal law, any child under the age of 18 engaged ina 
commercial sex act“ is a victim of a "severe form" of human trafficking. ” Criminalizing child 
victims as if they were offenders undermines that legally protected status; it also perpetuates 
abuse by directing focus away from adult exploiters and masking structural, systemic failures 
to provide community safety and accountability. And the failure to screen youth who come 
into contact with the system upon intake to identify whether they are victims of trafiicking —a 
common failure in many states—is inconsistent with federal guidance set forth in the Juvenile 
Justice Reform Act." As a result, many child trafficking victims remain unidentified, without 
critical services or support, and without the benefit of context when placement and treatment 
options are assessed. 
Still deeper criminalization occurs when more serious charges are brought against survivors. 
One example: child sex trafficking victims who are charged with recruiting other victims. “ 
This practice, which holds child victims liable as traffickers themselves, fails to recognize 
the broader circumstances: that is, the violence, coercion, threats, manipulation, and other 
forms of control that traffickers use to force their victims to exploit other children. It also dis- 
counts the harmful effect of survivors ’ ongoing trauma on their sense of agency and 
decision-making.
The story of Keyana Marshall, who was first groomed and sexually exploited at the age of 15 
provides a case in point: 
[S]he wound up under the control of [a] trafficker who fed her addictions, manipu- 
lated her emotions, threatened her, beat her[,] and kept her ﬁrmly under his control. 
What the [exploiter] told her to do, she did, to avoid or deescalate the violence she 
knew would follow if she said no and because that was the only life she knew. 4° 
Keyana was charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of children, pled guilty, and 
served time in federal prison.“ 
Girls are Criminalized for Acting in Self-Defense Against Abusers 
Despite the emergence of reforms, samples of which we discuss in the next section, girls 
continue to be funneled into the youth—and sometimes adult—legal system for acts that 
are rooted in attempts to escape the men who rape, sell, and abuse them, including acts of 
self-defense that sometimes require violence. In these cases, police, prosecutors, and 
judges often fail to consider the role of underlying victimization. As a result, victims often 
face a catch-22: they can comply with their exploiter and run the risk of arrest on prostitution 
or related offenses, or they can use the force necessary to escape, which risks criminal 
punishment for harming their abusers. 
Sentencing girls to years, even decades, of imprisonment for acting in self—defense against 
abusers is common across the country. But punishing survivors for acting against their 
exploiters without considering the trauma they have endured or the context of traffickers ’ 
coercion is not only unjust; it deprives girls of their freedom and the treatment and support

Girls are Criminalized for Reporting Abuse 
Law enforcement officers are charged with protecting victims of crime; but they, themselves, 
perpetuate the abuse to prison pipeline when they file false reporting charges against girls 
who report assault or trafficking." Charging survivors with false reporting reflects the lack 
of credibility often afforded to victims of gender-based violence. “°A recent ethnographic 
study found that detectives ’ determination that a survivor has filed a false report involves a 
complex combination of factors, including “the institutional frames of the department and the 
individual-level attitudes of the detective including adherence to rape myths." It concluded: 
[W]e found that detectives ’ construction of false reports is not only an individual- 
level phenomenon, but speak[s] to wider structural issues such as policing culture 
and societal views about rape.... 
The findings do not suggest that detectives believe all sexual assault cases are false 
reports, but they do hold the belief that false reporting occurs more frequently than 
the statistics indicate, suggesting that the rape myth of the lying victim/false report 
continues to be salient in [the jurisdiction], and potentially policing culture. Adher- . 
ence to the myth of the lying victim continues to shape how detectives view, under- 
stand, and respond to sexual assault and victims. “ 
Despite guidance issued by the FBI and the international Association of Chiefs of Police 
recommending against filing false reporting charges in these cases,” women and girls are 
significantly vulnerable to this form of criminalization. According to DeborahTuerkheimer, 
former assistant district attorney and author of Credible: Why We D0ubtAccusers and Protect 
Abusers: 
Most women who come forward with an abuse allegation against a man will confront 
the credibility discount. Judging credibility is a mighty power—because credibility is 
itself a form of power. Whenever we judge credibility, we are in a position to value, 
or to devalue, the speaker. ...The most vulnerable women experience credibility 
discounting at its most extreme, while men who are protected by greater status or 
position are the beneficiaries of massive credibility boosts.” 
A leading researcher on the prosecution of rape victims has observed that ”the 
vulnerability of the complainant is a key factor in determining who gets charged with 
falsely reporting a rape.Vulnerable complainants are easier targets because they 
have fewer resources- —both social and financial —with which to challenge the police's 
treatment of them?“
Girls are a particular target of the "credibility discount." Research shows that interviewers 
often engage in "characterological victim blaming" of girls.“ ln fact, adolescent girls, who 
experience particularly high rates of sexual assault, paradoxically are also more likely to be 
discredited than both older and younger victims. Research has shown that adults view teen- 
agers who allege sex abuse as less credible than younger children "in part because adults 
view children as losing their sexual naiveté, and thus become capable of instigating lies about 
sexual abuse, at around 12 years o|d."“° At the same time, adolescents are viewed as less 
credible than adult survivors: "Adult stereotypes of adolescents may lead them to perceive 
adolescents ’ stories as less credible than adults’ , particularly when the victim was involved in 
illegal or experimental adolescent behavior (e.g., drinking alcohol)."° ’ According to the authors 
of a study on police refusal to submit sexual assault kits: 
Adolescents are often singled out by police as being particularly less credible, as 
law enforcement believe that their claims of rape are fabricated to cover up for "bad 
behavior" (being out late, drinking) and to try to avoid getting into trouble with their 
parents for those behaviors." 
Treating victims with undue skepticism and hostility creates disincentives for victims to report 
abuse which, in turn, reduces opportunities for them to receive critical forms of support. ” lt 
can also bias investigations and thwart the investigation of gender vioIence —and, by exten- 
sion, place more women and girls in the community at risk of harm.” 
ln addition, disbelieving survivors can traumatize them as victims“ in what has been de- 
scribed as “secondary victimization ’: insensitive, victim-blaming treatment that makes sur- 
vivors feel as though they are being [re-victimized] by the systems that are supposed to help 
them."°2This treatment can exacerbate girls’ culturally imposed tendency to blame themselves 
for the abuse they experience, which, studies show, can lead to anxiety, depression, PTSD, 
and suicidal ideation. ”

Many survivors have attested to the profound harm inflicted by authorities ’ hostile respons- 
es to their pursuit of accountability. ‘°' Chanel Miller describes her decision to press charges 
against Brock Turner, who raped her behind a dumpster while she was unconscious, as naive: 
I didn't know that if a woman was drunk when the violence occurred, she wouldn't be 
taken seriously. I didn't know that if he was drunk when the violence occurred, people 
would offer him sympathy.... l didn't know that being a victim was synonymous with 
not being believed. “ 
Women and girls who are viewed as promiscuous —a common gender stereotype that is often 
levied against marginalized girls—are even less likely to be perceived as credible. One study, 
for example, found that detectives ”dismissed rape allegations by women they believed were 
involved in [the sex trade] as ‘economic crimes' ." ln other words, they believed that the wom- 
en only "alleged rape when they were not paid.”‘°3 
Discrediting survivors is especially common for girls with intersectional identities. ‘°‘ Accord- 
ing toTuerkheimer: 
When women belong to groups that are marginalized, subordinated, or otherwise 
vulnerable, their allegations are even less likely to be credited. Class matters. 
Line of work matters. immigration status matters. Drug and alcohol use matters. 
Sexual history matters. Sexual orientation matters. Nowhere are the particulars more 
important than when it comes to race, which is ’inextricable from gender' ....‘°5 
Black girls, in particular, are targeted by stereotypes that portray them as hypersexualized, 
seductive, and exploitative of men's weaknesses. ‘°“These deeply racist perceptions are firmly 
ingrained in American culture. Anita Hill described her experience testifying before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee in 1991 about being sexually harassed by now-Justice ClarenceThomas: 
“Falsely casting me as an erotomaniac fit neatly within the myth of [B]lack women's 
sexuality."° ’_ 
Age matters too. Stereotypes of Black girls warp adults’ perception of them; they tend to 
view Black girls as young as 5-9 years old as more adult-like and more knowledgeable about 
sex than their white peers.‘°“ In the context of sexual abuse, this adultification bias may 
translate into authorities ’ dismissal of Black girls’ reports. ln fact, one study showed that in 
some circumstances, "even 6-year-old Black girls are perceived as less credible (and perhaps 
more sexual) than 6-year-old [w]hite gir|s," and less traumatized by their victimization than 
white girls.‘°9 
llinterrogators fail to recognize [Black girls] as [victims], but instead see them as 
mature, competent, and self-reliant [because] of adultification bias.The dominant 
narrative depicting [Black girls] as mature women, competent about sex and capable 
of consent, provides a readily available explanation for their traumatic experience. “° 
Ultimately, the practice of retaliating against women and girls who report sexual abuse excus- 
es—and in so doing, perpetuates —gender-based violence. ‘“ ln the words of Chanel Miller: 
Victims are often, automatically, accused of lying. Why is it that we're wary of 
victims making false accusations, but rarely consider how many men have blatantly 
lied about, downplayed, or manipulated others to cover their own actions?"

slow!“ Still, in the last several years, policies and laws adopted at both the federal Progress in developing systemic reform to end the criminalization of survivors has been 
and state level have begun to meaningfully reduce the criminalization of sexual abuse 
survivors. 
The White House and Federal Agencies 
ln 2015, the White House adopted the language of the abuse to prison pipeline report and 
called for reducing its harms. In President Obama's speech to the Congressional Black Caucus 
that year, for example, which showcased his administration's commitment to expanding its 
youth-justice work, he recognized that work to reduce youth pipelines into the prison system 
should not focus only on Black boys: 
[A]lthough in these discussions a lot of my focus has been on African American men 
and the work we're doing with My Brother's Keeper [an initiative launched in 2014to 
support boys and young men of color], we can't forget the impact that the system has 
on women, as well.The incarceration rate for [B]lack women is twice as high as the 
rate for white women. Many women in prison have been sexually assaulted, both 
before they got to prison and then after they go to prison. [W]hile boys face the 
school-to-prison pipeline, a lot of girls are facing a more sinister sexual abuse-to-pris- 
on pipeline. . .. So we're focusing on boys, but we're also investing in ways to change 
the odds for at-risk girls-to make sure that they are loved and valued.‘2° 
President Obama later emphasized his administration's prioritization of disrupting the pipeline 
for girls when he proclaimed January as National Slavery and l-iumanTrafficking Prevention 
Month, noting, "[W]e have worked to address the sexual abuse to prison pipeline that dispro- 
portionately affects those especially vulnerable to sex trafficking —-including young women 
and girls of color."‘2‘ His administration convened a meeting entitled "Girls of Color and lnter- 
vening Public Systems: lnterrupting the Sexual Abuse to Prison Pipeline," which invited young 
women and girls and national experts to discuss strategies to dismantle the sexual abuse to 
prison pipeline and promote better outcomes for girls of co|or."’ Further, in 2015, the White 
House Council on Women and Girls acknowledged the role that status offenses —violations 
that often are indicators of underlying abuse—play in increasing girls‘ routes into the system: 
The most common offenses for which girls are arrested include running away and' 
truancy.These behaviors are also the most common symptoms or outcomes of 
trauma and abuse. Once in the system, girls may be treated as offenders rather than 
girls in need of support, perpetuating a vicious cycle that is increasingly known as the 
‘sexual abuse to prison pipelinefm 
Other federal agencies, including the US Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against 
Womenl“; its Office of Justice Programs;"5 and its Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquen- 
cy Prevention (OJJDP), ‘2° as well as the Federal lnteragency Reentry Councilﬂ” have also 
recognized the pipeline and taken action to break the cycle. In discussing funding directed 
at increasing the availability of programs focused on girls in the youth legal system, OJJDP 
highlighted that trafficked girls often become caught up in the system and that 73 percent of 
girls in the system ”had past histories of physical and sexual abuse."‘”_ 
Federal Policy and Leadership 
Federal lawmakers have addressed —and continue to address—the pipeline through 
legislation and leadership.We describe below some of the most promising and noteworthy 
examples. 
in 2015, former Congresswoman and current Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass hosted a con- 
gressional briefing on Capitol Hill on legislative strategies to help curb the abuse to prison 
pipeline and better protect survivors of violence and exploitation. ” Several current and 
former Members of Congress made remarks at the briefing, including Representatives Bar- 
bara Lee, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Judy Chu, Hank Johnson, Bobby Scott, andTed Poe.“‘° ln 
2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in which formerly incarcerated girls and 
experts on the abuse to prison pipeline testified about the need for federal and state reform 
to dismantle the harmful cycle for gir|s.“" The hearing contributed to the introduction and 
eventual passage of bipartisan legislation explicitly addressing the criminalization of girls and 
survivors of abuse and exploitation: the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 (JJRA).‘32
* Girls of color stand at the intersection 
of ant:-credrb//rty bras against youth, 
women, and people of color. The JJRA includes several provisions that align with recommendations in our 2015 report. For 
example, it requires states to develop policies and procedures to screen all youth upon intake 
at juvenile justice facilities for human trafficking, document the number identified, and refer 
those children to appropriate services. ‘°”The law also follows two of our recommendations 
to reduce inappropriate treatment of pregnant girls in the system. First, it requires facilities to 
collect data on the number of pregnant girls in secure detention and, perhaps most critically, 
it requires states to implement plans to eliminate the use of restraints on pregnant girls in 
correctional facilities during labor, delivery, and post-partum recovery, barring evidence of an 
immediate and serious threat to hurting herself or othersﬂ“ In addition, the law echoes our 
report's call for states to create"a plan to provide alternatives to detention for status offend- 
ers [and] survivors of commercial sexual exploitation . . . such as home-based or commu- 
nity-based sen/ices or treatment. ”“5 Finally, the JJRA follows our recommendation that at 
least one member of each State Advisory Group have expertise in sexual abuse and sexual 
exploitation. “ 
More recently, in 2022, President Biden signed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act (VAWAJ into law, which includes several important provisions that will help prevent the 
pipeline for survivors. After years of advocacy, the law expands tribal courts’ jurisdiction over 
non-Natives who commit crimes-—including sexual assault, child abuse, sex trafficking, and 
stalking —against Native people!" The law also increases support and services to survivors of 
gender-based violence from marginalized communities, among other important updates. “ 
Also of note, the Senate passed a resolution in 2015 to promote the principle that trafficked 
children should not be viewed as prostitutes. Senate Resolution 81 expresses "the sense of 
the Senate that children trafficked for sex in the United States should not be treated or regard- 
ed as child prostitutes because there is no such thing as a ‘child prostitute ’ -— only children 
who are victims or survivors of rape and sex trafficking" and encourages federal agencies to 
treat them as such!” 
Other bills related to the pipeline have been introduced but have not passed. For example, the 
First Step Implementation Act of 2021 sought to retroactively end juvenile life sentences and 
de facto life sentences without parole.The legislation would have allowed individuals who 
""‘”1~'\’<'%‘ .""‘iI—¥ "<‘_=‘=?=%""“e~e. '*‘.7*3_r-< ‘3>=~

were convicted of crimes as minors to petition the court for sentencing review after serving at 
least 20 years."‘°The bill also outlined a process for sealing and expunging certain nonviolent 
juvenile records. “‘ When deciding whether to reduce prison terms, the bill instructed courts 
to consider ”the family and community circumstances of the defendant at the time of the 
offense, including any history of abuse, trauma, or involvement in the child welfare system.”‘“ 
In addition, the Childhood Offenders Rehabilitation & Safety/Actwas introduced in 2021 to 
limit the transfer of youth into the adult legal system!“ The legislation established a mini- 
mum age of 12 to hold children criminally liable and the minimum age for a child to be tried 
as an adult to 16.““ The bill also sought to eliminate the felony murder rule—which allows 
defendants accused of committing a violent felony to be charged with murder if the felo- 
ny resulted in death—for minors, and it forbid placing children in federal adult correctional 
faciIities. ““The legislation also required data to be collected on children who are adjudicated 
in federal criminal courts or detained in federal custody! “ Finally, the bill established a grant 
program to promote greater collaboration between child welfare and juvenile justice systems 
to improve outcomes for at-risk youth, including victims of commercial sexual exploitation!" 
Also in 2021, legislation was introduced in Congress that would allow trauma-informed 
sentencing for young survivors accused of harming their abusers.The bill provided discre- 
tion to federal judges to deviate from mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines to reduce 
sentences in cases where the defendant was under 18!“ This bill, known as Sara's Law and 
the Preventing Unfair Sentencing Act, sought to provide important protections for child sex 
crime survivors by allowing judges to take into account a defendant's age, trauma history, and 
reduced culpability in sentencing. ” lt was named in honor of Sara Kruzan, who was 16 years 
old when she shot and killed a man 20 years her senior who began sexually abusing and 
exploiting her at the age of 13.1“ She was tried as an adult and was prohibited from present- 
ing evidence about her abuse. Sara was sentenced to life without parole. After a campaign 
was launched in her behalf, Sara was released after serving 18 years and later pardoned. ‘5‘ If 
passed, the bill would represent significant progress at the federal level for sun/ivors of sexu- 
al abuse. ln Sara's words: 
l was an 11-year-old child when l was approached bya 
man l thought was safe. He exploited my innocence, 
and he set into motion a two-year process of grooming 
defined by repeated physical, psychological and sexu- 
al violence. When l turned 13, he began sex-trafficking 
me.Three years later, l shot and killed my abuser while 
he was again attempting to rape me in a hotel room.l 
was only 16. l was arrested and prosecuted, and by the 
time l was 17, l had been sentenced to life without the 
possibility of parole plus four years. l was wounded by 
an abusive system, incarcerated for almost 20 years 
and relegated to the shadows of our society. “~‘2 
Finally, the Prohibiting Detention of Youth Status Offenders Act of 2022 was designed to ban 
the ”valid court order" (VCO) exception, a legal loophole that allows children who commit 
noncriminal status offenses, like running away or truancy, to be incarcerated in juvenile de- 
tention facilities. “ The bill included the finding that the VCO has led to "thousands of youth 
being placed in secure detention" for these nonviolent violations. ” lt further found that girls 
are more often sent into the legal system for these acts than boys, and that girls often commit 
these offenses in response to abuse or traumal“
States’ Safe Harbor Laws: Eliminating Prostitution Charges for Children 
In recent years, more states have enacted "safe harbor" laws, which protect youth from arrest 
or prosecution on prostitution and related charges. While approximately 12 states had safe 
harbor laws in 2015, a majority of states have some form of this legislation today.‘56The pro- 
visions of these laws range from prohibiting the arrest of any minor on a charge of prostitu- 
tion-the most protective mechanism ‘5’—to permitting youth to assert an affirmative defense 
to a prostitution charge, to proscribing or mandating diversion for children prosecuted on 
charges of prostitution in lieu of adjudication. “ 
Some state laws go further, protecting survivors from a broad array of charges so long as 
the acts was committed while the child was being trafficked or was directly related to their 
exploitation. Ohio, for example, enacted a series of protections for child victims charged with 
crimes during the period of exploitation.The Ohio Supreme Court has directed juvenile courts 
to interpret these protections broadly regardless of the child's criminal history or the charges 
filed against them.‘5° 
Despite the progress that safe harbor statutes represent, they offer little practical protection 
from criminalization if unaccompanied by mechanisms that support implementation. Data 
on safe harbor implementation is limited, but studies have found limited improvement in the 
rates of arrests of trafficked children after many of these laws have gone into effect.‘°° Accord- 
ing to the Washington Post, for example, in Nevada alone, at least 110 children were arrested 
on prostitution-related offenses in 2019, despite the state's safe harbor law.“" 
Robust implementation of safe harbor laws can be limited by many factors, such as failure to 
commit to enforcement or lack of awareness, cross-system communication, training, or ef- 
fective screening tools for first responders and other system actors.“ Minnesota provides an 
example: according to a 2017 evaluation of the implementation of its safe harbor law, the leg- 
islation increased awareness of sexual exploitation among service providers, school officials, 
and law enforcement, resulting in greater understanding of what constitutes child sex traffick- 
ing and how to identify and respond to victims. “ The law also led to expansion in available 
services, including housing beds. Despite these gains, however, enforcement varied widely,‘“ 
in part due to communications challenges when coordinating services across agencies. “ 
Limited resources and inten/ention options can also undermine enforcement of safe harbor 
laws. Often, authorities decide to detain survivors because they believe it is the only means 
of keeping them safe.This approach sacrifices victims’ freedom in the name of "protection," 
despite their status as crime victims. ‘°°To create grounds to justify locking them up, sexually
exploited children are brought into the system on prostitution or proxy charges. ‘“’The injus- 
tice inherent in this treatment of child survivors was recognized by the Nevada Supreme Court 
in 2016, when it decried the practice of charging youth with offenses "just to get the child off 
the street." ‘“ 
in addition to depriving young people of their liberty, this approach also operates on the false 
premise that detention necessarily offers children safety. Detention is far from safe, especially 
for girls who have experienced abuse: according to one study, children who had experienced 
prior abuse were 52 percent more likely to experience sexual violence in detention. Mean- 
while, those who have been previously abused in another detention center were 697 percent 
more likely to experience sexual abuse in subsequent facilities! “ 
Enforcement and application of safe harbor laws are also vulnerable to authorities ’ race 
and gender bias,"° which can contribute to the disproportionate punishment of exploited 
Black girls as criminals rather than victims of sexual violence!" Studies show that Black girls 
are more likely to be arrested for prostitution, more likely to be adjudicated, and more likely 
to be detained in a locked facility than white girls, even after being identified as victims of 
trafficking!" 
Survivor Justice in the States: Protecting Survivors Who Commit Offenses in 
Connection with Sexual Abuse 
Growing recognition of the injustice of criminalizing trafficking survivors for coerced crim- 
inal acts has led to the adoption of vacatur and expungement laws in almost every state.” 
Though most states provide some degree of criminal-record relief for trafficking survivors, the 
extent of the support they provide varies widely. in some states, for example, vacatur laws 
only apply to minor victims of trafficking!" Despite the variance among these statutes, their 
widespread adoption across the country is a promising step toward addressing the harms of 
the pipeline for survivors of trafficking by clearing criminal records and allowing victims the 
chance to move fon/vard with their lives. Of course, vacatur laws represent a limited form of 
justice because they are premised on victims’ having entered the legal system; ideally, survi- 
vors would not have a criminal record in the first place. 
More "upstream ” protection has come in the form of state laws that protect child survivors of 
sexual abuse from being charged, sentenced, or incarcerated for extreme periods for crimes 
stemming from their exploitation, including for harming their abusers. Below, we highlight 
four examples of state approaches to reduce the criminalization of child survivors: 
~ ln California, the Justice for Survivors Act"5 went into effect on January 1, 2022.This 
law provides an affirmative defense to defendants charged with non-violent offens- 
es“ for actions that were committed as a direct result of trafficking and sexual vio- 
lence."’ The law requires prosecutors to consider the impact of sexual violence and 
trafficking on victims and their age in plea negotiations. lt also encourages judges 
to consider whether trauma, age, or sex trafficking contributed to the offenses when 
sentencing and re-sentencing. 
The law was inspired by a Black teenage girl who was sentenced as an adult to 
almost 10 years for offenses committed while she was being trafficked. According 
to State Assemblywoman Sydney Kamlager, who introduced the bill, the legisla- 
tion represents "an opportunity to correct unjust outcomes of the past and provide 
full context of the experiences that might impact a person's actions and use a more 
humanizing and trauma-informed response to criminal adjudication. ”"“When the bill 
passed committee, Assemblywoman Kamlager stated: "[T]oday brings us closer to 
acknowledging the role sexual abuse plays in criminal behavior and ending the abuse 
to prison pipeline. ”"’
v in Virginia, a child sex-crime victims protection act was passed in 2020 that prohib- 
its all mandatory minimum sentences for children and requires judges to consider 
adverse childhood experiences, childhood trauma, child welfare involvement, and 
the differences between children and adults in sentencing youth."'°The legis|ation's 
lead sponsor, Delegate Vivian Watts, explained the drive behind the legislation: ”A life 
sentence for a young girl who kills her sex trafficker is anything but trauma-informed 
or age-appropriate. Under our new law, after the judge considers the child's exposure 
to trauma, he or she can depart from any mandatory minimum and suspend any 
sentence that would otherwise be required for an adult....[W]e've created a paradigm 
shift that should prevent tragic injustices...from ever happening in Virginia." ‘°‘ 
~ in New York, the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act (DVSJA), ‘” passed in 
2019, authorizes courts to impose alternative sentences for survivors of domestic 
vioience —broadly defined to include any intimate relationship —if the underlying of- 
fense was committed against the abuser and was influenced by abuse when offense 
was committed. ‘°3Though the law does not specifically mention youth, courts have 
applied the law to adults who were convicted as minors: Patrice Smith, for example, 
whose case is detailed above, was released in 2020 pursuant to the law.““ 
v in Wisconsin, an affirmative defense law enacted in 2018 protects trafficking survivors 
from being prosecuted for "any offense” committed as a direct result of trafficking. “ 
Child trafficking survivor Chrystul Kizer, whose story is outlined above, successfully 
argued before the Wisconsin State Supreme Court that this statute can apply to her 
case and provide a complete affirmative defense to the murder charges pending 
against her.“ 
These efforts represent significant progress in reducing the abuse to prison pipeline for girls; 
but much work remains to end it. Whenever a child is charged with offenses against his or her 
abuser, courts should have the information, resources, and authority to respond in a manner 
that is trauma-informed and developmentally appropriate for youth survivors.
l
\
I B elow, we offer a set of principles to guide action to end the pipeline. In all cases, reform 
must be informed by survivors ’ own experiences, perspectives, and input. We hope 
these concepts will move researchers, policymakers, and others to engage in the critical 
systems change needed to build a world where all girls can live their lives to theirfull poten- 
tial without fear of violence or exploitation.

3. Prevent Gender-BasedViolence. Gender-based violence in the US remains perva- 
sive. ln fact, a recent sun/ey byThomson Reuters revealed that the US was the only 
Western nation to rank in the top ten most dangerous countries for women, mea- 
sured by the risk of sexual violence and harassment. ” And violence starts early for 
many. Childhood abuse, in turn, increases the risk of poorer long-term health and 
wellness. ‘°°We must invest in preventing gender-based violence so that all girls and 
young women can live in freedom and safety. 
"The abuse of women and girls is the most pervasive 
and unaddressed human rights violation on earth." 
-—Pres/dent ‘ Jimmy Carterlsg 
End the Credibility Discount Against Girls and Hold Law Enforcement Accountable 
for Disregard of Abuse Claims. In light of the evidence that unambiguously shows the 
pervasiveness of sexual violence against young women and girls)” it is time to end 
the discrediting of girls who report sexual abuse.This cultural change must be an- 
chored in structural, systemic reform that treats claims fairly and provides girls with 
safety, accountability, and healing. 
This means ending the practice of filing false reporting charges against survivors who 
report abuse. Unwarranted suspicion of girls who report abuse creates disincentives 
to seek justice, interferes with fair investigations, sows mistrust in the legal system, 
and perpetuates a culture in which rape is normalized. Most importantly, it exacer- 
bates survivors ’ existing trauma, compounding the harm they have already experi- 
enced and depriving them of the resources needed to heal. 
"[O]ne of the most overlooked yet effective ways to 
create social change is to just believe the stories that 
girls and young women of color tell us.”

Decriminalize and Support Girls who have been Sexually Abused and End the 
Punishment of Children Who Act Against Abusers in Self-Defense.The abuse to prison 
pipeline is driven by behaviorthat is rooted in responses to sexual violence —includ- 
ing violent or defensive behaviors to protect against sexual violence or exploitation. 
Girls who sun/ive gender-based violence should be recognized as victims of crime 
and protected from prosecution and harsh sentences for acts related to their victim- 
ization. Punishing victims reinforces the message that survivors receive from their 
abusers: that they are responsible for what has happened to them; that no one will 
believe them if they try to escape or seek help; that they will be punished for the 
abuse they survived; that their lives do not matter. Reforms must be enacted to 
expressly ban the arrest and incarceration of victims for offenses related to the 
gender-based violence they have survived; to educate and train authorities about 
the pipeline; and to build systems of support to address the trauma inflicted by 
sexual abuse.“
"l can't tell you how many times l was arrested. And 
l’m standing there in handcuffs and the ‘john’ ... hasa 
little talk with the police and they say, ‘Go on home 
now, let's not see you out here anymore tonight. ’ And 
l go to jail.You know, as a young person, l’m standing 
there with handcuffs on looking at the situation think- 
ing, ’Why am I the criminal? Why isn’t he getting in 
trouble?" ’ 
—-Noe/“*3 
Address the Disproportionately High Rates of Sexual Abuse Against Girls with Inter- 
secting Identities. Girls of color, girls with disabilities, LGBTQ|+ and gender expan- 
sive youth, immigrant girls, and other girls who experience adversity continue to 
experience violence at disproportionate rates and are more likely to be blamed and 
punished for the abuse they have survived. While all youth who experience violence 
deserve to be supported as child victims of crime, inequities rooted in discrimination 
and bias merit special consideration. 
"Everybody loves to throw around the term intersec- 
tionality. And for valid reason...we need to have an in- 
tersectional approach and an intersectional lens when 
we talk about any form of gender-based violence, es- 
pecially when it's on the premise of race. But whatl 
want people to understand is that many of our current, 
what l call the injustice systems, they don't have that 
intersectional lens. And if you don't understand the 
intersectionality between race, between capitalism, 
between patriarchy and misogyny, specifically when it 
comes to sexual violence, you're not going to under- 
stand why our system isn't working. ”

Ensure that Efforts to Address Gender-Based Violence Account for the Unique Expe- 
riences and Vulnerabilities of Adolescent Girls. Gender-based violence is committed 
against even the youngest girls!“ According to the CDC, nearly 35 percent of female 
rape victims were first victimized between ages 11 and 17; 14 percent were age 10 or 
younger. ‘"The impact is long lasting and generational, tending to repeat in future 
patterns of adversity. ‘°’Yet despite the unique factor of age, children, and particular- 
ly adolescent girls-—who experience the highest rates of sexual violence —are often 
grouped with women in research, reports, and policy reform.Young girls and adoles- 
cents must be recognized as distinct and explicitly protected against sexual abuse.
“My stepdad was an abusive person. Both to my mom 
and to me and my sister. Physically and sexually to 
me and my sister. l would say when l look back now 
there was a pattern going on. Little patterns, you know, 
starting outwith the bathing at six; ‘Don't worry l have 
the kids, you can go to the store’ . At eight, there were 
road trips that my mom didn't come on. So the pattern 
started building. l know that my sister protected mea 
lot of the times, and she endured more than l did just 
to protect me. So, growing up in it, l assumed 
it was normal.”
