 Hello Chair Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the 
Judiciary Committee. My name is Daniella Camero n. I am the Deputy Director of 
Preble Stree t and foun der of Preble Street’s Anti -Trafficking Service s. I am writing 
to testify neither for n or agains t LD143 5: An Act to  Reduce Commercial Sexual 
Exploitatio n. At Preble Street, we  stand in suppor t of reducing any form of  worker  
exploitation bu t are concerned about the way  that this bil l is written . The 
intersection of sex work and exploitation i s an incredibly complicated issue  
that requires us to take a step back,  devoting time and attention to arrive at  a more  
holistic approac h to decriminalizing sex work .  
 
Preble Street believes in  the full decriminalization of sex work.  Full 
decriminalization  reduces violence and exploitation and increases safet y for peopl e 
of all gender s. It also empowers worke rs to operate independently, reducing 
vulnera bility to trafficking.  Increase d enforcement and  criminalizatio n of peopl e 
who purchase sexual services d oes nothing to support victims  and does not address 
root causes of exploitation and trafficking.    
 
One of our biggest concer ns with this bill is that it assumes all sex work is non-
consensual, when we know that consensual sex  work amon g adults  is occurrin g 
throughout Maine.   And we know that increasing the rights of consensual sex 
workers is what leads to greater safety  while minimizing  exploitation.  The reality 
is, marginalized individuals often rely on sex work for economic survival due to 
systemic discrim inatio n, includin g in the workplac e, based on their race, gender 
identity, sexual orientation, or disability . The presumption made in the language of 
LD1435  conflates consensual sex work with the separate issue of  trafficking an d 
will mean that consensual sex workers will have their livelihoods actively 
criminalized.  Criminalizatio n, discrimination by service -providers, and stigma 
make people who  rely on sex work to make a livin g more vulnerable to violence, 
victimization, and exploitation.    
 
Successful ap proaches to address trafficking must protect  all the rights of survivors 
and respect  their bodily autonomy, agency, and self -determination . Focusin g on the 
rights of each individual and advocating for change in systems is the only path to 
restoring their d ignity and giving them  the opportunit y to reclaim the ir life . Human 
rights -based  trafficking  prevention focuses on the root causes that create  
vulnerabilit y to trafficking in the first plac e, such as poverty, homelessness,  hunger,  
weak  labor protections, a nd discrimination .

Preble Street uses this  human  rights -based approac h in all of our anti -trafficking 
work. We center the survivor’s voice and choice an d are committed to meaningful 
improvements in the health and safety of people who trade sex . Related  legislation 
should do the same .  
 
In light o f these concerns, I  ask that the legislature take more time to consider the 
nuances of this issue, rather than rushing to pass legislation that  harmfu lly conflat es 
sex work with forms of  exploitati on. The muddling of  these  two complex  
matter s creates a pathway to further crimina lization and trauma for both consensual 
sex workers and survivors of traffickin g — the last thing that any of us wan t.   
 
Thank you for your time.
