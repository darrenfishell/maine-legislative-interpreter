8enator Carney, Representative ivioonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecoa, and i iive in Lewiston. i am speaking mday in SUDWYT Of LD i An Act to Reduce Commercial Sexual Exploitation. For years I’:/e seen the sad effects of police scrutinizing people who are on #79 streets just trying to survive, When the /nan l Worked for went down we all went down charging myself and his other toy as he would refer us. The three of us got arrested for drug trafficking because the money we had from hirn was the money he had received in a wire buy. Each time I would come in and out of jail returning to the same old routines and the same old people like rnan y of my friends and other Women experience many of the sarne problems. Currently the only solution for women who are stuck in these cycles of rnen exploiting them or using drugs. 
One of my best friends who / rniss dearly; Lori, recently passed after 15 years on the streets of prostitution she was only shown the doors or’ the jail instead of 
helping someone. She only ever knew how to love a man and getting high were 
things she learned over the years that were her only We y to feel like she knew 
how to survive anymore. Her kids watched her rnother grow up working in 
Congress st battling her addiction and abusive boyfriend. She would have had 
the opportunity to come to a program and learn a new Way if she was offered it 
but instead, she died in a “dates house” We I”I6*6“d "OT at 1” 85? WQW9” who are the 
victims We need to provide sen/ices not sentences.
