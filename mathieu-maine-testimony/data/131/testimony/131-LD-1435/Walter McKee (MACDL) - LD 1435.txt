RE: LD 1435 – An Act to Reduce Commercial Sexual Exploitation  
        
Dear Senator Carney, Representativ e Moonen , and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary,  
 
MACDL opposes  LD 1435.  This bill remakes, yet again, Maine law as it relates to 
sexual trafficking and prostitution. Over the past several years, the Legislature has 
passed a number of bills and enacted into law a whole host of provisions that increase 
penalties for engaging in prostitution  and engaging a prostitute. It is unclear why this 
bill has  been proposed as there is no evidence that has been developed to determine 
the impact of the changes to pr ostitution -related crimes to date.  
 
Additionally, increasing  the class of crime for “ commercial sexu al exploitation of a 
child ” and “solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation”  is being 
advanced in the total absence of any evidence that the current classification  of the 
crime as a Class D crime, carrying with it up to 364 days in jail, is inappropriate. 
There will be no test imony from anyone that indic ates that a judge has said in the 
course of sentencing someone  for the Class D crime that 364 days was not enough of 
a sentence and then sentence the defendant to that 364 days; rather, these crimes , 
when sentenced, are well wit hin the Class D range of s entences from 0 to 364 days, 
and there is no reason to make these crimes felonies carrying p enalties up to 5 years in 
prison. 
 
Thank you for the  opportunity to address this bill.  
 
Sincerely,
