v MAINE 
DENTAL 
_' ASSOCIATION â€œ-in-I" 
Testimony of the Maine Dental Association 
Before Health Coverage, Insurance & Financial Services Committee 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 789 An Act Regarding Dental Licensure for Charitable Care 
Public Hearing: Wednesday, March 22, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and Distinguished Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee: 
My name is Therese Cahill and l sen/e as the Executive Director of the Maine Dental 
Association. The MDA is a statewide association dedicated to advancing excellence in 
dentistry. 
The MDA represents 85% of the dentists in Maine; there are 774 practicing and retired 
dentists who are active members of the association. 
On behalf of the Maine Dental Association, I am respectfully providing Neither For Nor 
Against testimony on LD 789. 
While the MDA is most definitely supportive of all efforts to expand access across the State, 
we believe a pathway to commensurate licensure currently exists. MDA member dentists 
along with other licensees participated in numerous stakeholder meetings convened by the 
Board of Dental Practice over the course of several years. We believe that work has lead to 
appropriate and positive changes to the Dental Practice Act which most benefit patients 
across Maine. 
At this time, we are not convinced that reinstatement of this licensure type is necessary. 
Thank you for your time and attention.
