Testimony of Representative Michel Lajoie introducing 
LD 674, An Act to Allow Bail Commissioners to Carry Firearms in Correctional 
Facilities and Jails 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Good morning Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and fellow honorable members of 
the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is Michel Lajoie, and I represent 
House District 96, which includes a portion of Lewiston. I am here before you today to introduce 
LD 674, An Act to Allow Bail Commissioners to Carry Firearms in Correctional Facilities and 
Jails 
This bill would amend the current statute to allow Ô¨Årearms to be carried by duly appointed bail 
commissioners, in the performance of their duties for the judicial branch, provided they have the 
approval of the chief administrative officer of the correctional facility or the jail administrator, 
subject to facility security regulations. Making this simple change would allow bail commissioners 
to more seamlessly perform their jobs on a daily basis. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am happy to answer any questions you may have. 
District 96: Part of Lewiston
