Testimony for the 131th Session of the Maine State Legislature
Joint Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Public Hearing March 13 , 2023
LD  674   Ought not to pass
Chairpersons  Senator Anne Beebe- Center and Representative Suzanne Salisbury 
and members of the Committee,  my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I live in  
Cape Elizabeth.
 I am opposed to bail commissioners being permitted to be armed inside a prison.  
I do not understand why a bail commissioner would need to be armed  to carry 
out his or her duties in a prison.  Every time a gun is introduced into a situation,  
the risk of accident is also introduced.  Letâ€™s not take that added risk of mishap.
I would hope that the approval of the chief administrative officer of the 
correctional facility or the jail administrator of the specific prison would not be in 
favor of this bill,  but regardless, I encourage you to vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
