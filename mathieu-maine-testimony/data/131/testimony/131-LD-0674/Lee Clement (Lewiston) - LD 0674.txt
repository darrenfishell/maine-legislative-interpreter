Joint Committee Chairs and Committee Members:
I wish  to thank Rep. Michel Lajoie for submitting and sponsoring this bill which seeks to 
remedy and error or omission of unintended consequence from the 130th Legislature. 
I support LD 674, An Act to Allow Bail Commissioners to Carry Firearms in Correctional 
Facilities and Jails.
As a bail commissioner (Maine Judicial Branch) and a twice-retired law enforcement 
officer with a total of over 50 years’ service in the criminal justice system, I have seen 
and experienced many bad  things that can happen to people who are not prepared. 
I have been called to bail  an individual with $25,000  cash bail set. He was arrested for 
numerous drug trafficking charges as part of a significant drug bust.  His surety, an 
individual from out-of-state, an area noted for trading in recreational pharmaceuticals,  
asked, as we counted $25,000 in cash, if Maine Bail Commissioners “carried?” I took 
this to mean he was trying to determine if we were armed. As one who is authorized by 
18 USC 926C or H.R. 218 the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act to carry and qualify 
annually to maintain certification, I feel qualified to carry in all situations.
Many of these encounters occur at night. The area surrounding the jail I most often 
frequent can be dark and there are areas  which could easily support a physical attempt 
at robbery or worse.  I have learned of other commissioners carrying large sums of cash 
being confronted with situations where they were concerned for their safety.
Every jail or facility I have been called to has locker available for securing firearms 
which can then be retrieved as the commissioner is leaving the facility.
In speaking with the sponsor of the bill which was codified as 17-A MRSA 1059, Rep. 
Costain of Plymouth, it was never his intention to preclude judicial officials from being 
allowed to carry firearms, especially under the approval and regulations of the sheriff or 
administrator.
This is merely a minor correction which will afford bail commissioners a level of 
protection that was removed by the original bill. At a time when bail commissioner 
numbers are in decline, I believe the total has dropped from over 160 when I started to 
around 71 currently. I would respectfully submit that this is one thing that may assist in 
retention, especially since the jail or facility will have the final say.
I thank you for your time and consideration.
