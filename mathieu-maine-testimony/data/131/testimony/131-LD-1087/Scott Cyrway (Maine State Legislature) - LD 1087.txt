Presented by 
Representative Scott Wynn Cyrway 
District 63 
Criminal ]ust:ice and Public Safety Committee 
Thursday, April Z7, Z023 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the ]oint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: 
I am State Representative Scott Wynn Cyrway, and I proudly represent District 63, which includes 
Albion, Freedom, Unity Township, and a portion of Winslow. It is an honor to appear before you for the 
purpose of introducing of L.D. 1087, “An Act to Remove Restrictions in the Provisions of Law Relating 
to N0-knock Warrants. ” 
This legislation proposes to amend several provisions of the law with respect to no-knock warrants by: 
1. removing the provision stating that any warrant is a no-knock warrant if it is executed Without 
waiting 20 seconds after announcement of authority and purpose to make entry; 
2. adding preventing the destruction of evidence to death and bodily harm in the exceptions to the 
requirements of no-knock warrants; 
3. changing the clothing required to identify law enforcement while executing a no-knock warrant 
from a uniform to an article of clothing that clearly identities an ofﬁcer executing the warrant asa 
law enforcement officer; 
4. requiring law enforcement officers executing a no-knock warrant to follow the policy of the lead 
law enforcement agency executing the warrant as opposed to an individual officer's law 
enforcement agency; and 
5. allowing an untrained officer to use a stun grenade, stun, distraction, or other similar device dining 
the execution of a no-knock warrant in pressing circumstances. 
As a deputy sheriff, I can attest to the importance of L.D. 1087 as it speaks to maintaining my safety, as 
well as to the protection of other law enforcement ofﬁcers. The current warrant system necessitates the 
announcement of law enforcement followed by a 20-second countdown before making entry. A lot can

happen in 20 seconds, especially if multiplied by the number of People in the building. Hiding evidence, 
releasing a dog(s), acquiring a weapon(s), or even ﬂeeing reduces the Prospect of possible conviction While 
increasing the risk of harm on those executing the warrant. Ultimately, a swift entry lessens the potential 
for violence and preserves the likelihood of securing sought after evidence. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I leave you with this question. Who is in a better position to 
determine the parameters of a search warrant. . .a judge in Possession of validating grounds for issuance, or 
politicians viewing the matter from 30,000 feet?
