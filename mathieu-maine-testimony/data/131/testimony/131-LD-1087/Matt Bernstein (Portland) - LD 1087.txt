Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on 
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety:
My
name
is
Matt
Bernstein
and
I
am
a
resident
of
Portland.
I
am
writing
to
express
my
opposition
to
LD
#1087.
I 
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
testimony
in
opposition
to
LD
#1087
and
I
ur ge
you
not
to
support
this
bill.
I 
believe
that
the
actions
laid
out
in
this
legislation
will
put
both
the
public
and
Maine
law
enforcement
in
danger
and 
that
the
legislation
is
also
counter
to
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
Mainers.
In
2021,
LD
#1 171
was
passed
with
bipartisan
support
to
restrict
No-Knock
warrants
in
the
state
and
enhance
safety 
for
law
enforcement
and
citizens.
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
collaborate
with
others
and
share
insight
into
the
creation 
of
LD
#1 171
in
2021.
T wo
of
the
crucial
pieces
of
this
legislation
are
the
requirement
to
wait
20
seconds
before
law 
enforcement
enters
and
the
requirement
to
have
law
enforcement
in
uniform.
Now ,
LD
#1087
seeks
to
remove
both
of
these
protections.
Doing
so
will
lead
to
more
rushed
and
unclear
interactions 
between
law
enforcement
and
the
public,
which
puts
all
parties
in
increased
danger .
When
law
enforcement
are
not
in 
uniform
they
are
not
easily
identifiable
and,
therefore,
can
be
confused
with
an
intruder
or
home
invader .
This
is 
especially
true
when
there
is
limited
time
for
people
to
answer
the
door .
W earing
a
single
article
of
clothing
is
not
the 
same
as
a
full
uniform.
Consider
that
an
article
of
clothing
could
be
a
baseball
cap
and
now
think
of
how
many
people 
wear
all
dif ferent
types
of
caps
every
day .
W earing
such
an
item
would
be
insuf ficient
for
purposes
of
recognizing 
someone
as
law
enforcement,
especially
when
there
is
only
20
seconds
to
make
the
determination.
Conversely ,
we 
know
to
instantly
connect
a
police
uniform
with
law
enforcement.
Therefore,
requiring
of ficers
to
be
in
full
uniform 
ensures
that
they
will
be
clearly
recognized
as
on
duty
law
enforcement
of ficers.
Research
done
by
Brian
Dolan
of
St. 
John’ s
University
demonstrates
that
most
no-knock
warrants
that
become
fatal
are
when
of ficers
are
not
wearing 
uniforms
and
that
wearing
uniforms
protects
the
of ficers
as
well
as
citizens.
W e
do
not
want
fatal
interactions
between 
the
public
and
law
enforcement
here
in
Maine.
Rather ,
when
we
have
interactions
between
the
public
and
law 
enforcement,
we
want
them
to
be
clear
and
safe
for
all
parties
involved.
Maintaining
a
20
second
wait
time
and
a 
requirement
for
full
uniform
is
how
we
can
make
these
interactions
as
safe
as
possible.
Furthermore,
these
protections
are
widely
supported
by
Mainers.
78%
of
Mainers
believe
of ficers
should
knock 
loudly
and
give
those
behind
the
door
a
window
of
time
-
the
public
often
identifies
30
seconds
as
an
ideal
amount
of 
time
-
to
let
them
in.
In
addition,
92%
of
Mainers
believe
of ficers
should
be
identifiable
as
police
of ficers
by
their 
uniform
and
badge.
The
widespread
support
of
Mainers
coupled
with
the
increased
safety
of
the
current
protections 
demonstrates
that
we
should
not
remove
these
protections.
Simply
put,
we
cannot
put
either
members
of
the
public
or 
our
law
enforcement
of ficials
in
positions
where
they
are
interacting
in
rushed,
unclear ,
and
ultimately ,
dangerous 
ways.
For
everyone’ s
benefit,
it
is
important
that
we
have
maximum
safety
and
clarity
around
law
enforcement 
interactions.
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
against
LD
#1087
in
order
to
keep
the
current
protections
of
a
20
second
wait
time
and 
a
requirement
for
a
full
uniform.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
this
testimony ,
and
for
considering
this
in
your
deliberations.
