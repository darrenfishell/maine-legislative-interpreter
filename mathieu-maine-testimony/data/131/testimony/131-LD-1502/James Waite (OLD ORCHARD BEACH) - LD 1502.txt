LD 1502
I'm writing in support of LD 1502, An Act to Provide Consistency of Process for 
Maine's Electoral Votes by Prohibiting Enactment of the National Popular Vote 
Interstate Compact.
This bill prohibits the Legislature from enacting the National Popular Vote Interstate 
Compact as long as the State uses ranked-choice voting for any election in the State. I 
don't support the NPVIC or RCV.
Mainers deserve to cast their own Electoral College votes for president, and should 
not have their voice stolen from them by binding our state's Electoral College votes to
the winner of the National Popular Vote. This would effectively steal Mainers' voice 
in presidential elections and give it to residents of the most populated states and cities.
The Electoral College was designed to preserve the voice of each state and to give 
them individual representation in selecting our nation's president. Under the NPVIC, a
presidential candidate need only to win the votes of a small handful of cities and 
states throughout the country to secure the presidency, wiping out the voice and 
influence of the people of  Maine.
I urge this committee to vote "Ought To Pass" on LD 1502.
