Testimony in Support of LD 1502
An Act to Provide Consistency of Process for Maine's Electoral Votes by Prohibiting Enactment of the
National Popular Vote Interstate Compact 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1502, “An Act 
to Provide Consistency of Process for Maine's Electoral Votes by Prohibiting Enactment of the National
Popular Vote Interstate Compact.”
It is critical that we protect the voice of the People of Maine and the nature of our Republic. 
We must not give our votes away just to follow the choices of more populous regions. We are not a 
direct democracy; we are not supposed to be under mob rule. We already deal with the contentious 
issues of ranked-choice voting and low confidence in the integrity of our election, we should not 
further discourage participation in the democratic process by potentially disregarding the choice of 
Maine’s electorate if the popular vote goes contrary to ours.
I also dislike many of these compacts, which seem to create policies and rules that politicians 
don’t have to defend before their constituents and fellow lawmakers, and I didn’t vote for, but affect 
our state based on what other states do.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
