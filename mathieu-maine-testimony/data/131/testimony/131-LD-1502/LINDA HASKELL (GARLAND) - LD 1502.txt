LD 1502
LD1502 An Act to Provide Consistency of Process for Maine's Electoral Votes by 
Prohibiting Enactment of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact
LINDA HASKELL in OPPOSITION TO LD1502
The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement among a 
group of U.S. states and the District of Columbia to award all their electoral votes to 
whichever presidential ticket wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the 
District of Columbia. Another attempt to curtail the right of a fair and just election, 
By The People And For The People. Not for the advantage of the Democrat Party 
ONLY. These attempts of the House to destroy the fair and legal elections of the State
are outrageous. Ought Not To Pass.
