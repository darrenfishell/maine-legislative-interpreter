LD 1502
I want to express my opposition to LD 1502. Ranked Choice Voting is a pro-voter 
process that ensures that the successful candidate for the office in question has won 
the majority of votes. It ensures both that voters can express their clear preferences 
and that minority rule--anathema to the US Constitution--does not prevail. We want 
the voice of the minority to be heard and respected; we don't want the voice of the 
minority to rule, since the minority is clearly not representative of the most voters! By
their ranked votes, the people choose their reps. RCV creates that process, and the 
majority of Mainers are comfortable with it, and utilize it with ease. 
NPV works seamlessly with RCV to ensure that our single national office is held by 
the candidate who wins the most votes across all 50 states. A candidate who fails to 
win the popular votes will no longer be able to win the highest office in the country. 
Again, the founders did not support minority rule; they supported ensuring that the 
voice of the minority is heard and not stifled. Very wise; yet today, the country is, 
indeed, subjected to minority rule. RCV helps solve that problem in Maine, and 
nationally, as does NPV.  LD 1502 deserves no further attention from the State 
Legislature and ought not to pass.
