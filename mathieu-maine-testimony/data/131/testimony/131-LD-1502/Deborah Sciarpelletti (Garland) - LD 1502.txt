LD 1502 - An Act to Provide Consistency of Process for Maine's Electoral Votes by 
Prohibiting Enactment of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact
There is already consistency in the Maine's Electoral Voters. Get off our backs and 
leave the Electoral Votes alone. Spend your time and our money on regulating laws to
control the legal use of the Solar Industry of outer state companies and high powered 
individuals raping the fields and woods of the State of Maine.Where is the 
justification for the time and our money for all of the hogwash you Democrats try to 
push thru. Wake up to what the people of the State of Maine want, not the bull that 
you Representatives, Senators, the Secretary of State and the Governor want to push 
down our throats.
