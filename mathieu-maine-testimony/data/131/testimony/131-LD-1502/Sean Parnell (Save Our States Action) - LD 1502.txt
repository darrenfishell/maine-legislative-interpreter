Re' LD 1502 
An Act to Provide Consistency of Process for Maine's Electoral Votes by Prohibiting 
Enactment of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact 
May 17, 2023 
Chairman Hickman, Chairwoman Supica, please accept my written testimony on this legislation, 
which is offered neither in support of nor Opp0SltlOl ’l to LD\1502, but that l hope provides useful 
information regarding this bill 
LD 150i proposes to bar the'state of Maine from entering the National Popular Vote interstate 
compact (NPV)so long as the state uses ranked choice voting (RCV) in any election I would like1 
to explain the key issue involved here, which is the problems that Maine's use of RCV would 
create for the operation of the compact — regardless of whether Maine IS or is not a member of 
the compact — should NPV ever go into effect 
RCV creates serious problems for NPV because the compact anticipates that every state will, at 
the end of the election, provide a single vote total for each presidential slate, which can then be 
added into the national vote count Under RCV, however, there are at least two vote totals for 
each presidential slate — an initial total of first round votes, and then a final total, after the RCV 
process has concluded The compact does not provide any guidance on which vote totals are to 
be used by member states in determining the national vote count for each presidential slate, 
leaving it to the discretion of each member state's chief election official (typically, as in Maine, 
the Secretary of State) Because the difference in first round and final round vote totals can be 
in the tens or even hundreds of thousands, in a close national election the choice of which vote 
totals are used in determining the national vote count could determine the outcome under 
NPV v /
\ 
Lobbyists for NPV reject this analysis, claiming that Maine's law requiring that final-round vote 
totals appear on the state's Certificate of Ascertainment resolve this issue What this assertion
K
I "Q 
ignores, however, is that Maine's law has no affect on the choice made by other states that are 
in the compact The chief election official of another state is not required to obtain Maine's 
vote totals from the state's Certificate of Ascertamment — the compact only requires that they 
obtain vote totals from an “official statement," a term that encompasses any number of other 
documents typically produced by states during the post-election tabulation and certification 
process NPV Chairman and founder John Koza explained to the Connecticut legislature in 2014 
” the National Popular Vote Compact does not depend on any particular piece 
of paper The "ﬁnal determination" of a state's presidential vote does not have 
to come in the form of the Certificate of Ascertamment lt could just as well be 
evidenced by, say, the official minutes of the state board of canvassers or any 
other official document from the state containing the vote count "1 
As part of the RCV process, IVlaine produces an "official statement" that includes both first- 
round and final-round vote totals Maine's Secretary of State is required to file with the 
Governor and make public a report detailing vote totals for all rounds} as was done following 
the 2022 election in the state's 2"“ Congressional district 3 No law passed by Maine can direct 
the chief election officer of another state to prefer Maine's Certificate of Ascertamment over 
this report or any other "official statement" produced by Maine when they gather vote totals 
for inclusion in the national vote count 
One reason another state's chief election official might prefer to use the first-round results 
rather than those on the Certificate of Ascertamment would be to avoid the erasure of 
hundreds of thousands of votes from the national vote count in the event either the 
Democratic or Republican presidential slates finished behind an independent or third-party 
candidate For example, in 1992 Ross Perot finished in second place in Maine (and Utah), iust 
ahead of George H W Bush Had the state used RCV in that election, Bush's final vote total 
from Maine that year would have been O, erasing more than 206,000 votes from his national 
vote count

Finally, I will note that lobbyists for NPV claim that it's not possible for there to be any conﬂict 
between the compact and RCV because the nation's leading proponent of RCV (Rob Richie, president 
of Fa|rVote) helped write the compact This ignores a 2021 paper on this issue that Richie served as 
the lead author of, which noted 
” as currently drafted, the [NPV compact] seems to assume a plurality system 
[Ulsing RCV for Presidential elections in states might seem incompatible with 
[N PV] Most fundamentally, which votes should be reported out for the purpose 
of [NPV]? Would it be the ﬁrst choices among all the candidates ’-’ Or would it be 
the final "instant runoff" totals after the RCV tallies are completed? If that latter 
choice were made, what if one of the two strongest national candidates was 
eliminated during the RCV tally in a given state'P"4 
That paper came out in August 2021, months after Maine changed its law regarding what 
information is to be reported on its Certificate of Ascertainment in an unsuccessful effort to 
address the problem Other leaders in the area of alternatives to plurality voting have also 
noted the conflict For example, Dr Warren D Smith of the Center for Range Voting warns that 
there will be a "trainwreck" if any state uses RCV while NPV IS in effect and observes "Different 
k/ll'1C|S of voting systems in different states simply were not designed to be agglomerated to yield 
one overall "popular vote winner""5 Other experts in alternatives to plurality voting have 
offered similar criticisms6 
While there may have been some recognition by the drafters of the cornpact that some states 
in the future may use RCV or other forms of non-plurality voting, the fact IS that NPV as written 
does not adequately address\the issue, which l hope you will keep in mind as you consider LD
