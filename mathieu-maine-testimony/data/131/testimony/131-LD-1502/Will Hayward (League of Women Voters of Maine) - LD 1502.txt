RE LD 1502 — An Act to Provrde ConsIstency of Process for MaIne's Electoral Votes by 
ProhIbItIng Enactment of the Natlonal Popular Vote Interstate Compact 
Good mornIng Senator H|ckman and Representatlve Suplca 
My name IS WIII Hayward I'm a resndent of Portland I am here today as the Advocacy Program 
CoordInator for the League of Women Voters of MaIne lam testIfyIng In opposItIon on LD 1502 
The League of Women Voters of MaIne IS a nonpartusan pol|tIcal organIzatIon that has been workIng 
smce 1920 to encourage Informed and actIve partIcIpatIon In government, to Increase understandIng of 
major publIc polIcy Issues, and to Influence publIc polIcy through educatIon and advocacy We never 
support or oppose any polItIcal party or candIdate 
LD 1502 seeks to prohIbIt thIs and future state legIslatures from enactIng the NatIonal Popular Vote 
Interstate Compact as long as ranked choIce votmg IS used for any electlon In the state 
The League supports the NatIonal Popular Vote Interstate Compact, and we look forward to the passage 
of that nonpartIsan legIslatIon by the 131st LegIslature NPV ensures that no candIdate who faIls to wIn 
the natnonal popular vote wIll wIn the presIdency, that every vote In MaIne, and In every state, wIll be 
equal and polItIcally relevant, that neIther dIstrIct nor state lInes wIl| act as barrIers to any cItIzen's vote 
for the offIce of presIdent, and that presIdentIal candIdates wIll seek to wIn the vote of every cItIzen, not 
Just those In swIng states 
LD 1502 provIdes no ratIonale for strIppIng ranked choIce votmg from every electIon In the state asa 
prerequIsIte for enactment of NPV MaIner voters have been usIng RCV sInce 2018 A Fa|rVote 
November 2022 poll found that 82% of MaIners saId RVC was easy or very easy, and that In 2022 40% of 
RepublIcan voters ranked a second candIdate choIce, up from just short of one thIrd of RepublIcan voters 
In 20181 
Ranked Ch0Ice VotIng works seamlessly wIth NPV, and Is Incorporated In the NPV bull, LD 1578 Once NPV 
Is enacted, Ranked Cholce Votmg ballot countIng wIll proceed In rounds to the top two candIdates LD 
1578 provIdes that the vote counts of the top two vote recIpIents wI|l be recorded and certIfIed toward 
the determInatIon of the natIona| popular vote

LD 1502 
Retammg RCV wnthm the NPV compact provndes each voter the opportumty to vonce their ranked 
preferences for all the pres|dent|al candndates on the ballot, thus ensurmg that every I\/b|ner's vote w||l 
be heard and be pol|t|cally relevant when added to the certlfled votes of the candldates across all 50 
states and DC 
The League of Women Voters of Mame cont|nues to strongly support both RCV and NPV, and we urge 
the Commlttee to deslgnate LD 1502 as Ought Not to Pass
