Thank you to the chalrs and member of the commIttee My name IS ChrIstopher 
Pearson, untIl January I had served 8 terms between the Vermont House & Senate 
and I work for Nat|onal Popular Vote 
I oppose thIs bIlI sInce It IS based on the false argument that ranked-cholce votIng 
and Nat|onal Popular Vote cannot work together The two reforms are entlrely 
compatIble When Nat|onal Popular Vote began In 2005 the fIrst organIzatIon to 
j0ln our coalItIon was Fa|rVote, the IeadIng RCV organIzatIon In the country 
It gets asserted by opponents of Nat|onal Popular Vote that MaIne usIng a ranked 
ballot could create challenges for other states once Nat|onal Popular Vote 
governs the elect|on They say the secretary of state In Colorado, for example, w|ll 
be forced to judge the outcome In MaIne and dec|de whether or not to use the 
fIrst-count totals or the fInaI results 
ThIs Is 100% false The language In the compact IS clear that Nat|onal Popular Vote 
states must rely on the ”fInal determInatIon" of the vote totals from every state 
In 2021 the MaIne leg|slature made It clear that MaIne's CertIfIcate of 
AscertaInment — the document your send to WashIngton wIth your PresIdentIaI 
vote count — lIsts the fInaI round count Federal law calls the numbers on a state's 
CertIfIcate of AscertaInment ”conclus|ve " 
WhIch means a secretary of state In 
another state has no power to quest|on your results and certalnly no authorIty to 
use any number besIdes what your laws produce PerIod 
I've also heard opponents look back 30 years to 1992 to suggest there could bea 
problem for major party candIdates who fInIsh behInd an Independent or thIrd- 
party candIdate 
The crItIque says supporters of George H W Bush would have been "erased" In* 
MaIne had you used a ranked-ballot In that elect|on because he came In behlnd 
Ross Perot ThIs assertIon overlooks a couple of Important poInts 
FIrst, voters of the major party candIdates for PresIdent have theIr votes “erased” 
In every state In every elect|on under the way we elect the PresIdent today Just 
ask a Blden supporter In Idaho or a Trump voter In New York
The crItIque also mIsses Is how extraordInarIly rare It Is for a th|rd-party or 
Independent cand|date to buIld much support In 1968 segregat|onIst George 
Wallace won 5 states and It was the last tIme someone bes|des a RepublIcan or 
Democrat won In any state In 1992 Perot came In second In MaIne and Utah 
pushIng the major candldates to 3'“ 
SInce every Pres|dent|a| electIon IS 51 separate state elect|ons, there have been 
612 elect|ons for Pres|dent sInce 1968 and a major party cand|date won In every 
state — 612 out of 612 In 2 of those an alternat|ve cand|date come In 2"d — when 
Perot pushed ClInton to 3"‘ In Utah and Bush Sr to 3'“ In lV|aIne 
One would presume that In an electIon under NatIonal Popular Vote, when every 
vote IS equal across the country and MaIne IS contInuIng to use an RCV ballot, a 
major-party cand|date would work hard to fInIsh In the top two 
NatIonal Popular Vote and Ranked ChoIce V0tIng can work together Arguments 
otherwIse come from opponents of both reforms tryIng to drIve a wedge where 
none IS deserved I hope the commIttee Wlll reject thIs bIll Thank you
