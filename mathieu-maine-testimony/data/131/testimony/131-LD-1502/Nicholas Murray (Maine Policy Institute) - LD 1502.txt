Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1502:
“An
Act
to
Provide
Consistency
of
Process
for
Maine's
Electoral
Votes
by
Prohibiting
Enactment
of
the
National
Popular
Vote
Interstate
Compact”
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1502
.
As
Maine
state
lawmakers,
you
are
responsible
for
representing
residents
and
voters
across
the
various
parts
of
the
state,
many
of
whom
live
in
rural
areas.
Yet,
some
contend
that
a
national
popular
vote
would
be
better
for
Maine
voters
than
the
current
system,
under
which
the
state’s
two
Congressional
districts
separately
distribute
their
electoral
votes
based
on
residents’
preference,
and
the
remaining
are
awarded
to
the
winner
of
the
statewide
popular
vote.
By
joining
the
National
Popular
Vote
(NPV)
compact,
Maine
would
give
up
this
unique
split-vote
system
for
one
that
would
reward
large
metropolitan
areas,
none
of
which
are
located
in
the
state.
Even
if
Maine
allocated
its
electoral
votes
like
the
other
48
states
do,
our
Second
Congressional
District
would
forgo
the
attention
it
has
seen
over
the
last
few
presidential
election
cycles.
Our
current
method
of
allocating
electoral
votes
is
useful,
and
it
retains
the
distinct
differences
between
our
two
Congressional
Districts.
If
anything,
other
small
states
like
Maine—and
even
big,
diverse
ones
like
California
or
Texas—might
find
benefit
in
using
a
system
similar
to
Maine’s
(and
Nebraska’s)
current
division
of
electoral
votes
by
Congressional
districts,
instead
of
shifting
to
a
nationalized
vote
for
president.
Energy
spent
pushing
the
NPV
compact
would
be
better
suited
encouraging
other
states
to
adopt
the
Maine
model.
By
moving
to
a
national
popular
vote
system,
Maine
loses
its
unique
voice
in
presidential
elections.
For
a
Maine
state
legislator
to
support
NPV
is
to
completely
discount
the
opinions
of
one’s
constituents,
and
instead
defer
to
national
level
politics
to
make
their
decisions
for
them.
After
all,
New
York
City
has
more
residents
than
39
individual
states.
Voting
for
this
tells
Mainers
that
our
individual
choice
doesn’t
matter
in
choosing
the
President
of
United
States.

The
Electoral
College
is
an
historical
institution,
and
one
worthy
of
retaining
in
our
federal
system.
It
plays
a
crucial
role
in
ensuring
that
the
winner
of
the
presidency
gathers
a
broad
swath
of
support
from
states
across
the
nation,
not
only
in
the
large
cities.
It
protects
the
liberty
of
minorities
from
a
potentially
tyrannical
majority.
Finally,
the
contention
that
participation
in
the
NPV
compact
is
coherent
with
ranked-choice
voting
is
absurd.
If
an
RCV
election
is
to
count
only
existing
votes
in
the
final
round
of
tabulation,
the
system
would
remove
valid
ballots
from
Maine’s
contribution
to
the
national
popular
vote
count,
further
diminishing
the
weight
of
Mainers’
votes.
If
there’s
one
thing
all
Mainers
abhor,
it
is
ceding
our
destiny
to
big
cities,
high-paid
political
consultants
and
those
“from
away.”.
Please
deem
LD
1502
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
preempt
this
unnecessary
and
misguided
idea
to
give
away
Maine’s
presidential
electoral
power
to
larger,
more
populous
cities
and
states.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
