To whom it may concem, 
My name is Ashley McGeoghegan. I am currently a resident of The Bridge recovery 
sober living. I'd like to speak on the LD 109 bill that is being discussed. I am a person in 
recovery and it is because of sober living homes like the Bridge that I'm sober and working my 
recovery today. 
They have taught and continue to teach me so much valuable information that keeps me 
clean, a hard working woman in society, and a beneﬁcial part of our community today. The way 
recovery works in general is because of sober living, rehabs, and detox. To no surprise 
addiction is an epidemic right now and has been for so long. I’m trying to be a part of the 
solution and not the problem today. 
I could not have been the person I am today without these programs. Period. In active 
addiction, I didn't know there was hope for recovery. Not until I went to rehab and sober living. 
For that I am blessed and forever grateful. If I did not have this valuable place I now call home, 
The Bridge, I promise you I would not be sitting here writing this to you. I would not be sober, 
alive or in recovery. 
If it wasn't for these programs and the help l received while in sober living, I would be 
another overdose. Please consider not passing this bill. Thank you 
Ashley McGeoghegan
