To whom it may concern,
My name is Billie Jo Trumble. I am a 55 year old recovering alcoholic and addict. I’m currently
living in a sober house. I was released from prison on August 3, 2022 and entered the program
on that same day. I also moved into a sober house on that same day - The Bridge. I was
enrolled in IOP for 5 months, I graduated in december having completed IOP. I am currently
attending aftercare groups twice weekly and I also do one on one counseling once a week. I go
to meetings. I have maintained my sobriety since being in the sober house.
I’m writing this letter in concern of losing a room in the house in which I live. I have made
great strides, I have a job and I am working the program to the best of my ability and following
house rules. Living in the sober house has changed my life in many many ways. I have rebuilt
some family relationships and and I’m currently working on some amends to help rebuild
somemore. I would have have been able to do any of these things I have accomplished without
this house.
If I was to lose my room in this sober house I’m not sure what I will do. Living with family
members is not an option. Not now, not ever. I’m afraid that if I lose my room that I will be out on
the streets with nowhere to live. That being said I’m afraid of old habits (drug use) will be a
result of this - I’m afraid that I will die, or go back to prison. At 55 years old I can’t go back there.
Losing my room in a sober house scares me. I’m frightened things will turn out badly.
I’m begging you for me and my fellow roommates please do not pass LD109. It’s a death
sentence to all of us - struggling to maintain sobriety and rebuild our lives - one day at a time -
we need this.
Thank you for your time
Billie Jo
