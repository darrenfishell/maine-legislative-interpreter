Good morning distinguished men and women of the commillee. My name is Jeffrey Glover and 
Fm one of the hundreds if not thousands of residents who will be displaced if this bill is allowed 
to pass. So today l come before you to pose a Question. What is the price of a human life. I put 
forth this question because to simply put it. That is exactly what is at stake; human lives. Lives 
of countless men and women who depend on places such as recovery residences and 
residential programs. l know without a shadow of a doubt that programs such as room and ifs 
sober living homes saved my life. And many more lives before me. l live in a loving, supportive 
environment that otherwise l wouldrrt have if not for programs such as these and places they 
provide that l can call home. And l assure you that many other if not all the men and women 
who live in the sober homes feel exactly as l do. Our lives would be shattered if Bill LD W9 
where to pass. And so l strongly appose such a bill. it will destroy so many lives including my 
own. So I leave you with the question l posed to you at the siart of this message. What is the 
price for 21 human lire.
