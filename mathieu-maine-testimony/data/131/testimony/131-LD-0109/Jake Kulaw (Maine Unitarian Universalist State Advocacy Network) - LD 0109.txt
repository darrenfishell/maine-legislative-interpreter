Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety:
My name is Jake Kulaw and I am testifying on behalf of MUUSAN 
(Maine Unitarian Universalist State Advocacy Network) to oppose LD 
109, “An act to Improve Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery 
Residences.”  The first principle of Unitarian Universalism is the 
inherent worth and dignity of every person. This includes people in 
recovery. Our faith is one that stands for justice, equity and compassion 
in human interaction. The effect of LD 109 would be precisely the 
opposite. We are standing in solidarity with the many organizations 
who oppose this bill such as the Maine Association of Recovery 
Residences, Portland Community Recovery Center, and the Recovery 
Advocacy Project of Maine, whose mission is to protect and advance 
the interests of the vulnerable Maine residents protected by the current 
law that LD 109 would repeal.
The current law as LD 353 passed unanimously in both chambers of 
the 129th legislature and was signed by Governor Mills. Nothing has 
happened since that time that would suggest they were all mistaken.
This bill could lead to the closure of recovery houses across Maine. 
This would have a devastating effect on people who are seeking help 
and support on the road to recovery. We are in the middle of the worst 
housing crisis in Maine’s history and see only continued increases in 
overdose deaths: We cannot afford to lose a single housing bed, 
especially recovery housing beds! 
I want to thank you all for being here today and for all of the work that 
you are doing and will continue to do. We know that helping people in 
recovery is something all of you care about. On behalf of MUUSAN, 
we ask that you vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 109, “An Act to 
Improve Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery Residences.” 
Sincerely,
Jake Kulaw
