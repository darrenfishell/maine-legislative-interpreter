LD 109
My name is Sandra Katz and I live in Saco Maine. I am writing regarding LD109, an Act to 
Improve Safety for Individuals living in Recovery Residences. Although I certainly want 
people to be safe, I do not think this bill is the right bill. There are too many items in the bill 
which will ultimately cause many group homes to have to close. The requirements, like 
sprinkler systems, are onerous for these homes. 
Therefore I am very against this bill.
Thank you for your time!
Sandy Katz
