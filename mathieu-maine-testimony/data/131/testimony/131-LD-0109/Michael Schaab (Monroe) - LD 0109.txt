LD 109
Dear Senator Beebe, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety,
I am writing to ask for your opposition to LD 109. My name is Michael Schaab and I 
live in Monroe. It is nearly impossible to read our local Republican Journal, the 
Bangor Daily, or listen to national and local news without hearing about the housing 
crisis that is affecting every region in Maine as well as in the nation. Every day I hear 
about this issue. LD 109 would place a burden on many, if not all, of the Recovery 
Houses here in Maine. I believe we cannot morally add more more struggle for those 
Maine residents who are already endeavoring to overcome issues such as drug abuse 
and misuse, mental illness, homelessness. We should be looking for more Recovery 
Housing, not less. These are places where the people living there are working toward 
reentering our communities as contributing members. While everyone going through 
these programs is successful, those who do manage their recovery become extremely 
productive citizens because of their experiences. During the previous public hearing 
on LD 353, there was tremendous support by the legislature, the State Fire Marshall, 
and the Maine Attorney General, to support Recovery Houses as Single or double 
family units so as to not overburden them financially. I hope that you will follow in 
that pathway and vote “ought not to pass” on LD 109.
Sincerely,
Michael Schaab
Monroe, Maine
