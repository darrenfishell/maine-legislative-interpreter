LD 109
I urge the members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety committee to vote ought
not to pass on LD 109. 
The misleading name of this bill will increase safety for no one. Recovery houses are 
key facilities for supporting those living with substance use disorder and working on 
sobriety. With affordable housing in short supply and many ill people living on the 
streets, the committee can and should reject this attempt to close existing recovery 
houses.
Substance use disorder is an illness, not a crime. Treating it as a crime is a direct 
cause of the current overdose epidemic. Do not erect more barriers to receiving help 
for this mental illness. Reject LD 109.
