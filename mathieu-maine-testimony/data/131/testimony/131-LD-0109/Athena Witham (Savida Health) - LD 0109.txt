LD 109
Dear Senator Anne Beebe, Representative Suzanne Salisbur, and honorable members of the
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety;
My name is Athena. I am a University of Maine graduate social work student interning with 
SaVida Health. I am writing today to provide testimony opposing this bill.  
Working with individuals affected by substance use disorder, I have seen how Recovery 
Residences play a critical role in supporting people after incarceration and addressing 
Maineâ€™s increasing number of people living outside and overdose fatalities. Affordable 
housing options that support recovery- like recovery residences are paramount in recovery 
and preventing fatal drug-related deaths that continue to take people who are our family, 
friends, and neighbors in Maine.
 
Across the state, there is a shortage of affordable housing, including recovery residences. LD 
109: An Act to Improve Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery Residences is a harmful 
barrier disguised with a misleading name that risks closure to existing recovery residences. 
LD 109 disproportionality harms a targeted population and is tone-deaf to the efforts across 
the state to prevent substance use disorder-related deaths and increase services and 
infrastructure that support the recovery community.
 
 
I urge the members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety committee to vote ought not to 
pass on LD 109.
Athena Witham
