To whom it may concern,
I’m Jeremy Green, I’m here to day to talk about how important sober living is to me and
my recovery. I’ve been in addiction all of my life, running the streets, terrorizing society, with no
place to go and no foundation. When finally I was given a chance to be in a program I moved
into a sober house and its been the best thing for me.
As time goes on you build a relationship with these other people. You laugh together, we
cry together, and when someone is struggling we all go through it with then and we push to
come out on top. Sober living has been the best thing for me and a lot of other people. It helps
me become a part of society.
Also, I’m sure where I would end up if sober living was taken from me. I’ve learned a lot
but I want more, I need more, so eventually I can build my foundation. Already there is not
enough help for addicts as it is. So please I ask you to make the best decision and oppose
LD109.
Jeremy Green
