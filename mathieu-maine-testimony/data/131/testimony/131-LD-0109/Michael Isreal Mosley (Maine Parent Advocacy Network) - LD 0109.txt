To the Honorable Members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety,
My name is Michael Isreal Mosley, I am the Executive Director of the Maine Parent Advocacy 
Network. Our members have asked me to speak on their behalf in opposition to LD 109 An Act 
to Improve Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery Residences. You have doubtless heard 
legal arguments about how this policy would violate the Americans with Disabilities and Fair 
Housing Acts. Youâ€™ve likely also heard about the impact this will have on capacity to provide 
care to those in recovery.
However, I am here today to speak on the very real impact for families that lack of capacity 
would create. People in recovery are not just individuals who live in a vacuum. Some are 
mothers and fathers. Some of those parents have had to go through the most painful 
experience any parent can face: the loss of their children through DHHS involvement.
For those parents, Recovery Residences are a critical resource in the journey to family 
reunification. At a time when our CPS system is in bad need of an overhaul the last thing we 
should be doing is taking resources away from parents and families that can lead to positive 
outcomes that can bring children out of the system in healthy ways.
For that reason the parents of MPAN ask the committee to vote Ought Not to Pass.
