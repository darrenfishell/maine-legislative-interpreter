LD 109
Oppose LD109 
January 2023 
Dear Representative Laundy, Representative LaJoie, and honorable members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am Jeanne 
Marquis, citizen of China, Maine and a parent of a person in recovery. 
I am writing in opposition to LD109 because contrary to this bill's title, An Act to 
Increase Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery Residence, if this bill passes many
recovery houses will be forced to close. The majority of these individuals, who are in 
their early stages of sobriety, will suddenly be homeless at a time when our state is 
facing a housing and an opioid crisis already killing our citizens. This bill is NOT 
about keeping people in recovery safe. 
This bill seeks to repeal Sec. 1. 25 MRSA ยง2452, sub-ยง4, which was passed 
unanimously in all bodies in the 129th Session. This would take the status of single 
family housing from Recovery Residences and require owners to install sprinkler 
systems at the expense of $20,000 to $40,000 per house. The recovery community has
heard from owners of sober houses that this expense will force many houses to close. 
Legislation without the appropriate funding is unfair, cruel and in this case potentially
deadly. 
Recovery Residences are an essential step in the recovery process. We know now from 
studies that connection into a supportive community, away from the past environment, is 
important to ensure a successful, long-term recovery. I have seen the tight bonds formed 
between people living in the same sober house. This does become their new family. We need
to keep the single family classification for Recovery Residences. This is not the time to see 
these houses close. 
Please DO NOT PASS LD109. 
Thank you for considering my viewpoint.
