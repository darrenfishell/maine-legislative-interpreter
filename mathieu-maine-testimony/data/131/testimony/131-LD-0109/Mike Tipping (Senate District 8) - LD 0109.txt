Mike Tipping, Senate District 8
Testimony in opposition to LD109
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury and distinguished members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
I write in opposition to LD109. Having consulted with recovery advocates in my 
district, I'm concerned about the effects this legislation could have on our state.
As Kelly Cookson, Director of Save A Life Recovery Resource Center in Lincoln put 
it:
"While this bill appears to be well intentioned, the reality is that most of the recovery 
residences in the state will be shut down due to lack of funding to accommodate the 
requirements. Plain and simple, people will die. If they donâ€™t die of relapse, many will
be displaced with no Plan B that I could see and die of the elements. 
I know of so many these homes have helped to become happy, contributing members 
of society. They are needed and will not be available if this billed is passed."
I share these concerns and hope you consider these potential consequences as you 
evaluate this bill.
Thank you for your time and attention,
Sen. Mike Tipping
