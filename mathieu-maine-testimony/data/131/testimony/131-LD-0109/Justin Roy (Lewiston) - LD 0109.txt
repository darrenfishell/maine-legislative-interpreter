Good morning, Senator Bee-Bee Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of The 
Criminal Justice & Public Safety Committee. 
My name is Justin K. Roy. I strongly OPPOSE Bill LD109 mainly due to the fact that I am 
keenly AWARE of the horrific impact it will surely have on, "Recovering Individuals" , like 
myself. 
I am a person in "Early Recovery" , that has lost EVERYTHING, picked myself up and "tried- 
again, more times than I can accurately track at this point. I've been to D-Tox, IOP and 
Residential Treatment more times than I care to admit. Over the course of the last two-and-a-half 
decades I've become somewhat of an expert on both Active Addiction/Recovery. 
Each time I completed a Treatment Program, I've thankfully had a Reentry/Recovery Network 
to safely TRANSITION into. Recovery Housing has faithfully provided me the "loose-structure" 
& Community of Recovering Peers that I required in order to rise-up & become the Recovering 
&Thriving Member of, "The Lewiston Recovery Community" , I Ô¨Ånd d myself to have the 
privilege of being a-part-of today. I Volunteer in the Community, attend and chair 12 Step 
Meetings & help other "Recovering People" in OUR COMMUNITY. 
A Bill like LD109 would cripple this Network of Recovery Houses I've come to rely on so 
steadfastly. Please squash this Highly Dangerous Bill. Many of MY Fellows will surely parish in 
its wake. I trust you all will make the Compassionate Choice. Thank you all for your time to hear 
US out on this day. My Gratitude in without-bounds... 
Yours Truly, Justin K Roy
