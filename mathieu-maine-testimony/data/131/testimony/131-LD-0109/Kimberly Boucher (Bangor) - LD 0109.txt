Though this bill sounds helpful on the surface, people in recovery need support and 
help now. Recovery residences work, but unfortunately if this bill is signed into law, 
many of these recovery centers will not be able to make the capital improvements to 
keep their doors open. I do not support this bill, but would support funding to be made
available to recovery houses to make these upgrades and maintain the safety of their 
buildings. It is far more important that they are able to keep their doors open at this 
point then encounter additional challenges to do their work.
