To Whom it may concern,
My name is Amanda Stevens, I’m a sanford resident and I’ve lived in Maine my whole
life. I currently live in a sober house called “the bridge”. I’m almost 10 months sober, I’ve been
an addict for 10 years of my life and I’m 26 years old. I’m just finally getting my life together. I’ve
been with the bridge and ENSO for almost 1 year now. ENSO Recovery and the bridge saved
my life. I work full time at a day care, I love my job, I just bought myself a car. I’m now present in
my families and friends lives. I’ve never been more motivated or happy in my life.
This place helped me gain all of that and I couldn't be more thankful to the staff. If I were
to lose my housing or my rent increase, I would be back on the streets. I would lose everything.
I’d lose my job, my sobriety, my friends and family, everything would be gone. I’m writing
this letter in hopes of preventing that from happening. I have a lot of goals and dreams and I
want to succeed in life. I want to make my family proud.
Please consider this letter and all the other addicts in sober living or on the streets
waiting for a place like the bridge that passing LD109 would effect. Taking away sober living will
only add to the problem and make it a whole lot worse.
Sincerely
Amanda Stevens
