Good Morning Senator Deschambault , Representative Warren  and honorable members  of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety.   
My name is Leslie Clark,  and I am speaking today as Executive Director of  Portland Recovery 
Community Center  (PRCC) , and as a person in long -term recovery from substance use disorder 
(SUD). I am speaking in opposition of LD109.  
For the last ten years, PRCC has provided a safe haven for those in or seeking recovery. A 
significant percentage of  our members and volunteers  currently live in a recovery residence or at 
one point in their recovery journey resided in one. Recovery residences uniquely provide a safe 
and supportive living environment that is conducive to strengthening the ir resident sâ€™ recovery.  
Current law allow s recovery residences to be classified as single -family homes for the purposes 
of fire codes if they meet certain criteria. If current law is repealed with the passage of L D 109, 
many recovery residences could be required to install sprinkler systems with an estimate d cost of 
$20,000 -$40,000. Recovery residences across Maine  may close being unable to afford such 
costly installations.  At a time of such great need Maine would be going backwards with the 
passage of LD 109.  In recent years, collaborative effor ts have grown the number of safe, quality 
recovery residences that are a critical component of recovery support services.  
Last year,  650 Mainers lost their lives to a fatal overdose between  January - November 2022.  
Overdose deaths in 2022 outpaced those in  2021 , and that is true without even having data 
available yet from December 2022.

Furthermore, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
homelessness in Maine increased by two -thirds between 2021 and 202 2. As overdose deaths 
continue to rise and Maine is in the middle of a housing crisis, we urge our legislators to vote 
against LD 109. Our community cannot afford to  lose a single bed in recovery residences.  
I thank you for the opportunity to testify in oppos ition of LD 109 and would be pleased to 
answer any questions that the Committee may have at this time.
