To whom it may concern,
My name is Jamie Hamilton.  I currently reside at a sober living house and attend an IOP in
Sanford, Maine at Enso Recovery.  I am writing to you against installing sprinkler systems
throughout the sober houses as the expectation for those currently residing in the sober houses
is to move to other locations.  This in turn would lead to a large number of men and women who
are trying to sustain their recovery and to recover in a safe environment, to become homeless
and out on the streets.  For me, I have no place to go and would be one of those people who
would become homeless inturn this could jeopardize my sobriety.
My recovery and stable living situation is of utmost importance to me at this time and in the
future.  I ask that you take into serious consideration the lives of the individuals this will be
affecting if you should go through with this project.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Jamie A Hamilton
