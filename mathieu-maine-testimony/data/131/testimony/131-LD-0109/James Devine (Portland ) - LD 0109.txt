Testimony in Opposition to LD 109
Hello Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, 
My name is Jim Devine and I am an Advocate with Homeless Voices for Justice at Preble Street. I am also 
a person in recovery. I am writing to you to testify in opposition to LD 109: An Act to Improve Safety for 
Individuals Living in Recovery Residences. 
Most of my life, my work as an electrician allowed me to support and house myself, but my struggle 
with alcoholism led to me becoming homeless and living on the streets. I’m very grateful for the various 
recovery establishments that helped me. During my struggles, I was very grateful for the support I 
received from organizations such as Milestone, Merry Meeting House, Serenity House, The St. Francis 
House in Lewiston, St. Mary’s Detox in Lewiston, and many more than I can name. Some of these 
facilities have since closed. I am in support of keeping the remaining facilities open and functioning, so 
that they can continue to help individuals. I think it is very important to make sure that there are spaces 
available where folks can get the help that they need. 
Although I respect the fact that establishments need to be safe for people to live in, please do not make 
the rules so difficult to fulfill that these places are forced to shut down. Thank you for all of the work 
that you do, and please vote to oppose this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Jim Devine
