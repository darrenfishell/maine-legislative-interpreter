Dear honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, thank 
you for your time and consideration today. My name is Ben Burgess and I am a resident of one of 
Recovery Housing of Maine's sober living houses located in Auburn. I am also proud to be the house 
manager, and proud to be one of the 12 men living under that roof who are working to become better 
every clay. 
I always find it difficult to explain exactly how much living in a sober house has changed my life for the 
better. When I came into this program and moved into the house I had nothing and no one positive in 
my life. I didn't think I ever would again. I needed to be part of a loving and safe community who 
understood me, because they were very much the same. I needed someone there to lift me up on the 
hard days and celebrate with me on good days. 
I continue to need my brothers in the house, I love being able to be there for someone who is struggling 
So many of the men that we help through that struggle simply wouldn't be safe without a safe place to 
go. I understand the importance of live saving measures, but we cant risk losing the most effective life 
saving measures of all: connection, community, hope, and a safe place to recover and learn to heal. We 
cant risk losing houses that become homes. Homes where we find family when we need them most. 
Thank you.
