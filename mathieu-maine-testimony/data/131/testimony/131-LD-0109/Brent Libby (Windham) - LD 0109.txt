Please accept this testimony as support for LD 109. 
Recovery Residences are facilities that provide a very needed service and do great 
work. They should however, fall under all applicable life safety codes to include 
sprinklers just as other boarding home and/or medical facility does. In the instance of 
a rapidly moving fire, an undetected fire or other hazardous condition those in 
residence should be afforded all possible benefits for survival. 
Thank you to Representative Landry and this committee for their support of this very 
important legislation.
