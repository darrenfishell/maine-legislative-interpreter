To whom it may concern:
I am writing this letter to stress the importance of treatment in Maine and why passing
this bill would make the already difficult task of recovery even more unattainable.  My personal
experience as a recovering addict has been a long, strenuous, and emotionally tolling journey.  I
have successfully achieved long-term sobriety and have grown to become a productive member
of society.  I am currently living at a sober house in Sanford, Maine through the ENSO recovery
treatment program, and have lived here for seven months.  ENSO has guided me through
completing intensive outpatient therapy, obtaining employment, and counseling, all while
providing me with a safe, sober, supportive living environment.  This program has been
imperative to my continuous sobriety and well-being.  Any type of unnecessary high-cost
requirement stipulated to sober living dwellings would make it incredibly difficult to keep these
programs running, as most of the owners are here to help recovering addicts rather than for
financial gain.  To me, this is not a business - this is a personal and safe place to live while
receiving treatment.  With this bill being passed, many sober houses would not be financially fit
to keep their programs afloat.  Many successful recovering addicts, including myself, would be
unable to pay the increased rent, and therefore left without a place to live.  With less options for
treatment available, harm reduction will no longer aid the safety of our community.  Drug use will
increase, relapse rates will escalate, as well as crime and overdose rates spiking tremendously.
The passing of this bill would compromise the progress and quality of so many lives, and all
aspects of the repercussions must be considered with the utmost conscientiousness.
Sincerely,
Jessica Duplak
Resident at ENSO Recovery sober house
Sanford, Maine
