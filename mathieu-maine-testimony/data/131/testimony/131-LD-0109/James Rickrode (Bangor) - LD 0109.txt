Hello, my name is James Rickrode.  I am a 20 year resident of Bangor and an 
alcoholic and addict in long term recovery.  I have been the General Manager of 
Fresh Start Sober Living since we opened our first house in October 2018.  
Fresh Start provides safe and affordable housing for people in recovery 
from drugs and alcohol.  We currently have 12 homes totaling 89 beds and we are 
full with a waiting list.  All Fresh Start homes are certified by Maine Association of 
Recovery Residences.  Fresh Start staff works hard daily to maintain compliance 
with MARRs safety standards.  In the past four years we have helped several 
hundred people have safe affordable housing and remain abstinent from drug 
and alcohol use.
My involvement with Fresh Start has allowed me to be free from active 
addiction for over five years.  Fresh Start has also afforded me the opportunity to 
become a productive member of our community, and given me the chance to 
help many addicts and alcoholics achieve and maintain sobriety.
I am opposed to LD 109 because it would require us to install sprinklers in 
all our locations.  This requirement would be an insurmountable financial burden, 
and would likely result in the closure of some or all of our homes.  Closure of our 
homes would be a huge setback to all our current members and keep us from 
helping the dozens of future applicants each year.  
I cannot tell you how much Fresh Start has done for our community in the 
three minutes you have given me but hope you all listen closely to the other 
members and staff that have testified today.  I appreciate your time today and 
thank you for allowing us to weigh in on this important topic.
Sincerely,
James Rickrode
