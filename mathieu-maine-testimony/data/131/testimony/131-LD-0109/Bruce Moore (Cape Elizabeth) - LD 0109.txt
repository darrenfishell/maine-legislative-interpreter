Dear honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety my 
name is Bruce Moore. I was incarcerated for 35 years and I had no other plans than to die in prison, 
because that was all I knew. On Jun 21“ , 2021 I walked out of prison for the last time. Through the grace 
of God I found Recovery Connections of Maine. 
I have no doubt that this program saved my life. During my time in treatment I have been a resident in 
one of Recovery Connection's sober houses, a safe and sound place for me to change my thinking, my 
attitude, and my life. I know that without the house and the program I couldn't have changed as much 
as I have. 
You have guys coming out of the prison just like me all the time, and sober living houses offer thema 
chance to change. Without sober living there is a good chance they will die or end up right back in 
prison. Some guys could be forced to return to incarceration if they are on home confinement and there 
house is shut down. 
If this law passes where are guys like me supposed to go? It doesn't make sense to take away something 
that helps us change our llves and become happy, productive members of society.
