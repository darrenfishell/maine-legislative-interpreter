To Whom it may concern, 
My name is Heather Blow l'm a resident of Sanford. l'm here today to testify against LD 109.1 
believe giving the option of treatment to those who have been convicted of drug crimes would 
greatly beneﬁt them. Let's face it people who have been imprisoned of such crimes realistically 
keep making the same mistakes due to not leaming tools to handle their lives without drugs in 
order to‘ 
become a successful person of society. l'm a person in recovery and being in treatment 
and sober living has ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SAVED MY LlFE'| wouldn't be the thriving 
person l am today without it. 
Due to treatment and sober living l've mended my broken relationships I now see my 
daughter i give back to my community and most of all l have the will to live again I see a brighter 
future for myself it's also taught me to love myself l was so broken before and it's given me back 
life. 
Treatment and sober living is a wonderful gift and everyone willing to participate 
deserves the opportunity at a better life therefore l'm against this act it would ruin the recovery 
community if housing was gone we are people's mother's father sisters brother or siblings and 
for those for have family suffering from addiction know that keeping sober living available to 
those in need is HUGE we all want our loved ones to recover wouldn't you If put in the situation 
want the same for someone you love? 
Thank you.
