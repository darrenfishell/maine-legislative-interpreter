To whom it may concern,
My name is Larry Brown. I live in a sober house in Sanford Maine. Iâ€™ve been in recovery
for 6 months and am doing well. Recently I heard that there is a bill LD109 that could threaten to
shut down a lot of sober houses. It could also raise the rent if it doesn't force them to shut down.
If I was to lose my home at the sober house I live at I would be homeless. Being
homeless to be would be the worst thing that could happen. If I was homeless I could possibly
relapse and die. I have a 13 year old son that I love dearly and if he lost me it would ruin his life.
Please reconsider LD109 and vote no on it. It will save so many people if you vote no on LD109.
