Good Morning Senator, Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and esteemed members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Simonne Maline, I am the Executive Director of the Consumer Council System of Maine 
(CCSM). I am here today on behalf of the CCSM in opposition of LD 109: “An Act to Improve Safety for 
Individuals Living in Recovery Residences. 
The Consumer Council System of Maine is a public instrumentality written into State Statute by the Maine 
Legislature to serve in an advisory capacity and to provide legislators with guidance and advice regarding 
the delivery of effective and appropriate adult mental health services from those served by them. 
Never has there been a more dire time to have recovery residences flourish in Maine! This bill seeks to 
destroy so much of the good work being done across the State to build capacity for recovery residences. 
During both an epidemic of substance use deaths and a housing crisis across the State, this bill will tear 
apart some of the most important supports needed for those struggling with a substance use challenge.  By 
requiring very expensive fire sprinkler systems in these homes would close so many of these houses due 
to the cost of $20,000 to $40,000 for each house. 
These houses are a critical component of the many individuals’ journeys of recovery, we just cannot do 
this. If anything, Maine could pay for these systems to be put in place. We cannot go backwards in Maine! 
To that end, we ask that you vote “Ought not to Pass” for LD 109.
 Thank you for your time and consideration.
Simonne Maline
Executive Director
