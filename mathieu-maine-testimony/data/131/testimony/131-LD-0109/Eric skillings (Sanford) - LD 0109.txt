My name is Eric Skillings.
I am a person in recovery.  I am here today to share why it's important for the recovery
community to keep the laws of recovery housing the way they are.  Recovery starts with safe
housing.  People with substance use disorder cannot get clean and sober in an environment
where people are misusing drugs and alcohol such as the homeless community or couch
surfing.  If this law passes it will be close to impossible for most recovery houses to stay open.
Most people that own and operate recovery houses do it because they care about this
vulnerable population.  So most recovery residences can afford the fee to install sprinkler
systems.  Maintaining the sprinkler systems would be too much money on it's own.  Recovery
housing allows people with substance use disorder to build a foundation in recovery.  It allows
people to rebuild their lives.  Residents begin to get things back that are so important in their
lives.  Rebuilding relationships, securing employment, getting a driver's license, a vehicle, and
one of the most important things is staying free from incarceration.  Recovery housing lowers
the recidivism rates.  This vulnerable population of people are trusted again and become
productive members of society.  If this law passes it will devastate our recovery community that
so many of us have worked so hard for.
Thank you for your time!
