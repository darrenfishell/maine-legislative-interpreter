Thomas P. Caswell on LD-109 
Hello, my name is Thomas Philip Caswell, I am here today because I understand what the impact of Act 
LD-109 will have on our community. I say this because I fear for the lives of my fellow people in 
recovery, their families, and everyone else in our beautiful state of Maine. A little over 2 years agoI 
found myself at the door to sobriety. I needed a place to live that would provide a structure of living 
which included stable housing, support through my recovery, and a family of individuals who, like me, 
wanted to change their lives. I found that at a sober house here in Maine. I had little to no financial 
stability and certainly could not live on my own without the overwhelming temptation of drugs in our 
community. The sober house I lived at provided me a place to be as I began to build myself back intoa 
productive member of our community. It was truly the building block of my sobriety, the foundation for 
which i could pour the concrete. Today I work in the recovery field at a residential re-entry program in 
York County, Maine. I am a full-time student pursuing a degree in mental health and I havejust been 
nominated by my teachers to the Dean's Advisory list to aid in the direction of the school. I am alsoa 
certified recovery coach in the State of I\/laine, and the list goes on. But this isn't about me. It's about 
the sober houses that help people like me get to where they too can thrive in this world, and in doing so
â€™ 
create a better community for all. 
I leave with one last thing. In 2022, as reported by the Maine Drug Data Hub, our beautiful State of 
Maine lost 650 lives to fatal overdoses throughout the year. Where I do not know the statistics of death 
by fire in our state during this year, I can say confidently with the upmost assurance that it does not 
surpass this number. If preventing death and saving lives is our number one safety concern, I need 
speak no more. 
Thank you
