Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. 
My name is Jeffrey Redwine, and I oppose LD109
 I live in Sanford, and am a member of the ENSO Recovery Family. 
In June of 2022 I was broken, in jail, and about to be released. Worst of all I was about to be 
homeless. Scared, I had no plan, no idea what I was going to do.  I knew that returning to my 
addicted lifestyle was not an option.  I also knew that If I returned to the streets that there was 
a good chance that I would fall back into my old habits.  Through the jail I was given a real 
opportunity.  An opportunity to feel safe. An opportunity to not have to worry about housing.  
An opportunity to work on myself within the safety, and direction of sober living.
Being in sober living has given me purpose, and a connection that I have never felt before. It 
has also given me a safe place to live. I have a full-time job; I am an active member of the local 
recovery community. I am also currently working towards getting a certification to be a 
recovery coach. All of these things would not be possible if not for ENSO and what they have 
done for me. 
Passing LD109 would make myself and hundreds of people in recovery homeless.  It would take 
away the safety net we have gained by our respective sober living communities. It would 
probably force me into an already inflated population of homeless people within our state. It 
would force me to quit my job, and relocate. All while fighting for housing that already isnâ€™t 
available. 
In short passing LD109 would be detrimental to my recovery my security and my safety.
