to me 
Hello Senator Bee-Bee Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee. 
I am Erik Dodge, a constituent of Lewiston, here today in opposition of LDI 09 due to the impact it will 
have on recovery housing. 
As operational director for A Hand Up recovery and re-entry housing, I oversee everyday living and 
responsibilities of residents. 
Duties of my position include: 
Filing agreements of residents to follow our standards of living. 
Enforcing the rules and expectations of our program. 
Properly instructing residents on preforming tasks. 
Collecting and managing funding. 
In compliance with Maine Association of Recovery Residences I provide instruction on how to properly 
handle the event of an emergency. This includes the administration of Naloxone and rescue breathing in 
the case of an overdose. The use of ﬁre escape routs and acknowledgment of the posted ﬁre escape plans. 
The use and locations of ﬁre extinguishers. 
I see the greatest barrier to overcome for residents of recover housing is the issue of rent, oﬁen times 
assisting them in ﬁnding some form of aid. LDl09 would impose such a ﬁnancial burden it would require 
raising the cost of living in recovery houses. Forcing many to homelessness without support, highlining 
risk of relapse and possible death. 
Growing up in a family of seven I did not have the awareness of ﬁre safety that I now have today. Having 
lived in a recovery house of ﬁve residence I was re-educated on ﬁre safety and gained CPR certiﬁcation. I 
now spread the importance of that knowledge onto others.
