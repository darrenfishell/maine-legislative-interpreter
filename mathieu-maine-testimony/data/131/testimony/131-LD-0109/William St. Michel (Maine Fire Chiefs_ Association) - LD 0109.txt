Testimony in Support of LD 109 An Act to Improve Safety for Individuals 
Living in Recovery Residences
Senator Beebe, Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of The 
Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. My name is 
William St. Michel, I am the retired Fire Chief of The Town of Durham and 
currently The Executive Director for Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association. Maine Fire 
Chiefs’ Association fully supports LD 109, An Act to Improve Safety for 
Individuals Living in recovery Residences.
Under current law certified substance use disorder recovery residences are 
treated as a family residence under the Life Safety Code. LD 109 would repeal 
that exemption and require that recovery residences meet the Life Safety Code 
requirements for that type of occupancy. The current law creates a dangerous 
situation for residents and responders, LD 109 would rectify that.
Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association would like to request your support in moving 
this important piece of Legislation, LD 109 forward. Thank you for your time!

William St. Michel
