Hello, my name is Jason Gammon. I am a lifelong resident of Maine, a person in long term recovery, and 
a person who works in the field of recovery at the Together Place in Bangor. I currently reside at a Fresh 
Start Sober Living House on Ohio St. in Bangor, Maine and have been a resident there since October 
2021.
In October 2021 I found myself being released from Mountain View Correctional Center after serving a 
12-month sentence. While incarcerated I heard of a men’s sober living house in Bangor named Fresh 
Start. That name “Fresh Start” resonated with me and my situation so I decided to reach out to them. 
Needless to say I am extremely happy I did. My involvement with Fresh Start Sober Living House has 
helped me regain my life including employment, family and personal relationships, and my overall 
health. Thanks to Fresh Start Sober Living I am now nearly 2 years completely free of substances, 
employed and overall, a better man.
With that said, I would like to address the issue at hand. I am opposed to LD 109 because it could 
require Fresh Start and other sober living houses like it to install sprinkler systems in their locations. The 
cost of this would not only affect the businesses at large but I am sure it would end up affecting the 
members as well. With the cost of living already a barrier, I fear that this bill would only add to that 
problem. For this reason, I am opposed to LD 109.
As a current member of Fresh Start Sober Living, I can tell you that we already have a well-maintained 
living quarter.  Every house is up to code, clean, secure, and well taken care of. There are fire 
extinguishers all through the houses, fire escape protocols including proper fire escape maps hanging on 
each floor, and every member is actively making sure everyone is informed on what to do in the event of 
an emergency. I humbly ask that you not consider this bill.
Thank you for your time and have a great day.
