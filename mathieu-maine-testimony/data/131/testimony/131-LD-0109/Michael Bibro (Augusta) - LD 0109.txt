Re: LD 109
To whom it may concern:
I would like to comment on the proposed passage of LD 109 which I understand would result in the 
closing of many of this State’s Recovery Residences.  I believe that the intention behind this bill is a 
noble one.  The impact, however, could be tragic.
I am a Licensed Substance Use Disorder Counselor.  I have worked in this field for nearly 32 years.  Much 
of that time was in service to incarcerated women and men.  A significant portion of my work entailed 
searching for inpatient treatment facilities or sober houses for client referrals.  The find was easy but the 
wait-lists were typically quite long.  The ideal was to transition the soon-to-be released client asap, post-
treatment, to a facility where he/she could resume treatment in the community – a safe place – in 
which to practice, practice, practice their program of recovery.  Unfortunately, the norm was often 
women and men returning to high risk people, places, and things. 
The recent concerted effort to address Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) has been encouraging.  It 
seemed that people were finally “getting it,” and recognizing SUDs for what they truly are: cunning, 
baffling and all powerful.  Finally, treatment became a priority and more accessible for those in need. 
The thought of fewer – far fewer – safe, recovery oriented, residences is alarming and contrary to the 
progress being made.
My plea to the legislators who are considering the passage of LD 109 is to assess the likely devastating 
impact to the many facilities who do not have the financial resources to meet the mandate.  I do not 
have a remedy to offer.  I leave that to the minds that have the capacity to resolve such things.  I trust 
they exist and I thank them in advance.
Sincerely,
