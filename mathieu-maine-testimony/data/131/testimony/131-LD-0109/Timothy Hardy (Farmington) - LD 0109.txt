Timothy Hardy
Farmington
LD 109
Senator Deschambault, Representative Warren, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice, and Public Safety. My name is Timothy Hardy, and I 
am the Fire Chief of the Town of Farmington Fire Department.  I write this in support
of LD 109, An Act to Improve Safety for Individuals Living in Recovery Residences. 
LD 109 will improve safety of individuals living in recovery residences in the event 
of a fire. My job as Fire Chief, is to ensure the safety of the people residing in the 
town of Farmington. Our town has locally adopted the NFPA 1 Fire Code and NFPA 
101 life safety code to give us the ability to apply fire prevention codes to the 
buildings in our community.  Throughout my time in the Fire Service, I have 
experienced the loss of life in residential fires and the risk an incident like this puts 
onto the firefighters attempting to rescue these citizens.  I feel the best way to prevent 
these incidents is to use the safeguards that are outlined in the life safety code to 
prevent these situations. By passing LD 109, allows us to apply the codes that are 
already in place as it is defined to regulate these residences. This will ensure the life 
safety of residents living in these residences. 
Thank You for your time, and please contact me if you have any questions. 
Respectfully,
Timothy D. Hardy, Fire Chief
