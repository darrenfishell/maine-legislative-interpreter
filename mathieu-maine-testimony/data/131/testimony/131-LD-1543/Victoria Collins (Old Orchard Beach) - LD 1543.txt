Testimony of Victoria Collins 
Vocational and Educational Corrections Instructor 2019, 
J .D. Candidate 2024 
Testimony in Support of LD 1543, Resolve, to Establish the Commission to Recommend Cost- 
effective, Safe, Administrable and Healthful Programs to Reduce Violence in Prisons and Jails 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety: my name is Victoria Collins, and I ama 
resident of Old Orchard Beach. I currently attend Maine Law, and upon graduation in May 2024, 
I expect to work in indigent criminal defense and to continue advocating for Mainers in our 
communities who are or were incarcerated. In 2019, I taught logistics and math in a medium 
security men’s prison in the state of Indiana. I have personal experience and interest in prison 
issues because of what I have seen my students go through. 
I ask that you vote “ought to pass” on LD 1543. This Resolve represents a great step forward in 
ensuring that prisoners in our state are sent to prison “as punishment, not for punishment. ”1 
Violence in prisons is detrimental to the health and psyche of prisonersz and prison staff} alike. 
Further, because of the impact of prison violence on staff who live in our communities and 
prisoners who return to our communities, LD 1543 is crucial to improving public health. 
In 2021, 1,624 adults were incarcerated in Maine prisons.4 In the same year, the Maine 
Department of Corrections (MDOC) conducted about 2,300 disciplinary proceedings.5 The 
numbers for 2022 are similar: around 2,400 disciplinary proceedings were initiated6 amongst a 
prison population of 1,635.7 The rates of disciplinary proceedings in 2021 and 2022 were thus 
approximately 1.4 times the prison population, meaning that some or many individuals were 
written up multiple times for behavior which does not compoit with MDOC standards. 
Of the seventy-nine Class A and B violations listed in MDOC’s Prohibited Acts,8 eighteen are 
violent offenses or offenses which implicate violence or threatened violence.9 Of course, the 
mere existence of these rules implies the existence of prison violence. Additionally, because only 
Class A and B violations pose a risk of disciplinary segregation (DS),‘° DS data is important in 
evaluating prison violence. In 2021, male prisoners sent to DS spent an average of 41 .65 days 
there; females spent an average of 8.83 days in DS.“ In 2022, the number of days for males was 
14.86; the average for females, thankfully, dropped to zero.” The sanctions for Class A andB 
violations are, respectively, up to ninety days in DS and up to ﬁfteen days in DS.'3 Thus, the 
2021 averages may suggest that most men in DS were sent there for Class A offenses, and most 
women for Class B offenses. The 2022 averages may suggest that most men in DS were sent 
there for Class B offenses.

Of course, these numbers create a mere impression of the rates of prisoner-on-prisoner and 
prisoner-on-staff violence, and do not at all reﬂect the rate of staff-on-prisoner violence. 14 The 
data also does not reﬂect the number of unreported violent incidents, of which there are 
undoubtedly many due to the chilling effect of a strong “snitches-get-stitches ” culture within 
prisons. “ 
Unfortunately, there is no reliable report accessible to the public which reﬂects the number of 
violent encounters in Maine prisons. Indeed, it is remarkably difficult to ﬁnd any recent data on 
violence in state prisons across the U.S., particularly regarding females. However, there are some 
national statistics to which we may turn. For example, the rate of homicide among prisoners is 
twice that of the general population. 1° 
Additionally, national data compiled in 2009 shows that 
“[a]pproXimately 21% of male inmates are physically assaulted during a 6—month period . .. 
sexual assault during a 6-month period in adult male prisons [averages] around two per 100 
imnates. ”l7 
Vfhile I have not worked in Maine prisons, I am familiar with prison enviromnents from my 
work in correctional education in 2019, and state-run prisons are generally not dissimilar state- 
to-state. I have seen blood, bruises, and black eyes. I have heard my students struggle to breathe 
due to cracked ribs. I have heard men yelling in pain as they were attacked in the yard. I have 
read prison medical reports detailing the aftermath of rapes and gang assaults. Of course, those 
who are most impacted by such violence are the victims of it, and the trauma that they suffer 
because of physical and sexual attacks leads to higher rates of recidivism.l8 Additionally, though, 
I have witnessed how prison violence secondarily and sometimes directly impacts support staff 
and correctional officers. The trauma that staff at my prison suffered from witnessing and being 
involved in violence led to high rates of burnout and low rates of staff retention. As researchers 
for the National Institute of Justice have found, “[Correctional off1cer]s are exposed to a number 
of safety and wellness-related risks. Most notable are the risks of death or physical injury, but of 
equal concern are mental health-related risks such as stress and bumout.”‘9 Such staff instability 
only fuels the cycle of violence. It is clear to me that a commission of the sort proposed today 
could have drastically improved the Well-being of residents and staff at my prison. 
Despite the deﬁciencies in the data, it is clear that violence in prisons is a serious and pressing 
problem. Establishing a commission to study and address this problem is a step in the right 
direction. This Resolve will go far in protecting the health and safety of Maine’s prisoners, 
prison staff, and communities. For these reasons, I ask that you vote “ought to pass” on LD 1543.
