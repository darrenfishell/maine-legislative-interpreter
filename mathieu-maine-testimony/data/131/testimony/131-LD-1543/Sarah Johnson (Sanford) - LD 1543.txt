Testimony of Sarah Johnson
 IN SUPPORT OF LD 1543  
Resolve, to Establish the Commission to Recommend Cost-effective, Safe, 
Administrable and Healthful Programs to Reduce Violence in Prisons and Jails
Presented by Representative Moonen of Portland
Before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, April 25, 2023 
 
Representatives Moonen and Salisbury and Honorable Members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Sarah Johnson.  I am a Software Support Specialist and I live in Sanford. 
I am a former volunteer instructor at the York County Jail (15 years) and the 
Women’s Center at the Maine Correctional Center and Southern Maine Reentry 
Center (4 years).   I recently worked in the education department at the Western New 
Mexico Correctional Facility in Grants, NM for 4 years. 
I am writing to ask for your support of LD1543 which will help create a safer 
environment for everyone involved in the Maine Department of Corrections.  The 
goal of this bill is to have experienced people develop healthy and cost effective 
programs and procedures to reduce violence in Maine’s jails and prisons. The 
expertise of this group will review scientific data on other violence reduction 
programs, both national and international. The safety of residents and staff in Maine’s
jail and prisons is of great importance to everyone and this Commission is an 
excellent path to ensuring it. 
All Mainer’s will benefit by this bill as a safer environment in the correctional system 
will save taxpayer dollars, as well as be the foundation for more successful reentry 
programs. 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this bill, and for all your dedicated 
work.
Sarah Johnson
