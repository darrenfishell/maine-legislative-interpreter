Healthful Programs to Reduce Violence in Prisons and Jails 
Before the 
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony in support of LD 1543, with the caveat that there are still needed amendments. 
However, as you have heard ﬁom Representative Moonen, the MDOC has been working closely with him, Jan 
Collins, and Mary Bonauto. We are close to an agreement on mutually acceptable language for this resolve. We 
appreciate the committee ’s time as we thoughtfully engage in the process of violence in prisons and jails. 
Thank You,
