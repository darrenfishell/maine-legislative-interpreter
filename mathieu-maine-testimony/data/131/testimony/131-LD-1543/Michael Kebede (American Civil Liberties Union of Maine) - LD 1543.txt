TESTIMONY or MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
Ought to Pass - LD 1543 
Resolve, to Establish the Commission to Recommend Cost-effective, Safe, Administrable 
and Healthful Programs to Reduce Violence in Prisons and Jails 
l 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
CR]1\/IINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety, greetings. My name is MichaelL 
Kebede, and I am the Policy Counsel at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed 
to advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and -U.S. 
Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge you to support this bill. 
If enacted, this bill would establish a commission to study violence in Maine jails and 
prisons, and to recommend solutions. The commission would include a bipartisan and broadly 
4 
representative group of ﬁfteen members, each chosen for their unique perspective on the 
persistent problem of violence in correctional facilities. 
The Bill of Rights imposes a duty on all states to protect people in jails and prisons, 
where “the government's power is at its apex.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 511 (2005). 
Indeed, “[t]he whole point of the [eighth] amendment is to protect persons convicted of crimes.” 
’ 
Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189, 194 (9th Cir. 1979). Unfortunately, violence has long plagued 
Maine jails and prisons. Multiple news outlets have recently reported on mysterious and 
unaccounted-for deaths,‘ “a culture of abuse within Maine State Prison,”2 and “a series of violent 
incidents at the youth prison in August and September ” of 2021.3 Importantly, whenever

someone is subjected to what the Department of Corrections calls “restrictive housing, ” and what 
some observers call solitary conﬁnement, the ofﬁcial justiﬁcation is often that the incarcerated 
person was involved in a violent incidentfl By helping the state address the root causes of 
violence in correctional settings, this bill will help Maine end solitary confmement, which 
imposes an “immense amount of torture and agony” on prisoners. Apodaca v. Raemisch, 139 S. 
Ct. 5, 10 (2018) (Sotomayor, J ., respecting denial of certiorari). Because this bill will make jails 
and prisons safer, and help Maine abide by its duties to those in its custody, we urge you to vote 
ought to pass.-
