RE:   LD 1475, An Act to Promote Biomanufacturing and Biotechnology   
  Development by Establishing a Tax Credit  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation: My name is Samantha Warren and I am the Director of Government 
Relations for the University of Maine System (UMS), writing to inform your consideration of LD 
1475 , An Act to Promote Biomanufacturing and Biotechnology Development by Est ablishing a Tax 
Credit.  
In recognition of the unique role of research and development (R&D) in driving and diversifying 
private sector growth , 25 years ago the Maine Legislature established both the Maine Technology 
Institute (MTI) and the Maine Economic Improvement Fund (MEIF), which targets  investment  in 
commercially promising R&D  within Maine’s public universities  including in  biotechnolog y.  
Toda y, MEIF generates at least a 6:1 return for Maine and creates the capacity at the 
University of Maine and across our System  to prepare our state’s knowledge and 
technical workforce, and help hundreds of companies each year to develop new 
products and proce sses necessary to stay competitive in a global economy and support 
good -paying Maine jobs . Thanks to the ongoing MEIF investment supported by the 
Legislature, our small rural state is home to researchers and innovators of international impac t, 
working here and around the world to solve “wicked problems” of local relevance, like how to 
adapt heritage industries for changing markets and climates, manage and mitigate PFAS, detect 
cancer earlier, and even 3D -print affordable housing from wood was te. 
 
When MEIF and MTI were created, Maine ranked last among the 50 states for R&D spending, 
and despite the impact of these initiatives, has only improved to  44th, investing just 1% of GDP 
compared to the 4.8% New England average. Given this, every serious economic study 
undertaken in our state in recent years has called for bold increases in R&D investment , 
including a call  in the 2022 Measures of Growth report  to triple spending by 2030 and the 
2022 Making Maine Work report noting, “State government can double its investment in 
R&D annually without running out of viable projects.”  
 
The 10 -year state economic development strategy recommends that Maine utilize a 
combination of public subsidies, tax incentives and higher education investments , as does a 
forthcoming action plan from the Maine Innovation Economy Advisory Board, which is chaired 
by UMaine  President Joan Ferrini -Mundy, who is also our System’ s first Vice Chancellor for 
Research and Innovation.  
UMS supports this comprehensive approach.

 A proposal to appropriate an additional $6M annually for MEIF is pending before the 
Legislature, having been endorsed by the Education & Cultural Affairs Committ ee last month , 
and would enable UMS to work with even more companies and address critical challenges 
confronting the state through targeted interdisciplinary research solutions . 
Meanwhile, th e tax credits proposed by LD 1475 would help reduce  high up -front costs and time 
to commercialization  for biot echnology  and further leverage the State investment  in MEIF  and 
UMaine’s recent designation as a top -tier R1 institution — one of only 146 in the nation .  
In addition to being attracted to the Portland area where UMaine has  expanding R&D activities  
and the University of Southern Maine has established R&D operations, it is likely  with the right 
incentives,  a private sector biotechnology incubator could  locate in the Greater  Bangor region . 
This would all ow them  to be close to the flagship’s world -class facilities and our faculty, 
students, postdoctoral researchers and tech transfer experts who are innovating at the 
intersection of biosciences and our heritage farming, fishing and forestry industrie s.  
By way of example, t hough not a biomanufacturing company, just this month , Tyler 
Technologies,  which is headquartered in Texas but employs 1,000 Mainers,  broke ground on its 
newest office , strategically situated in Orono for proximity to UMaine talent an d innovation.  
Our state  has tremendous assets like UMaine and its many industry , institutional  and nonprofit  
partners , including The Jackson Laboratory and FocusMaine , that position us to be competitive 
in recruiting biotechnology and manufacturing investment, jobs and opportunity. Continued 
investment in high -return R&D at UMS combined with new i ncentives that help businesses  in 
the sector  start-up and s tay will allow Maine t o realize its poten tial and greater prosperity.   
We thank the Committee for your consideration  of LD 1475  and welcome any requests for 
additional information in advance of your work session.
