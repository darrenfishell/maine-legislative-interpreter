Good Aftemoon Sen. Grohoski, Rep. Perry and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation. My name is Linda Caprara I am the Vice President of Advocacy and a resident of 
Winthrop. We are testifying in strong support of L.D. 1475, An Act to Promote 
Biomanufacturing and Biotechnology Development by Establishing a Tax Credit. We would 
like to thank Sen. Jackson for sponsoring the legislation. 
L.D. 1475 encourages investment in biotechnology and biomanufacturing by establishing a 
refundable tax credit to attract talent and investment in these facilities. The increasing 
importance of innovation and R&D in today’s economy camiot be understated and is a stated 
goal in Maine’s Strategic Plan. 
The importance of biotechnology and biomanufacturing plays a key role in utilizing biology to 
create new products and solutions. Creating opportunities to invest in incubator facilities is 
extremely important to these startup companies because they help to offset costs such as lab 
space and equipment, provide support and mentorship, provide access to capital and help 
provide the tools to get these small companies up and running and accelerate their growth. Often 
times, this takes anywhere from 1 to ﬁve years. 
Biotechnology and bio manufacturing are so very important in ﬁnding solutions in the areas of 
health to achieve medical breakthroughs (vaccines and therapeutics) agriculture, environmental 
and energy areas, more efﬁcient and cleaner industrial processes etc. Maine is known as a small 
business, entrepreneurial state. Everything we can do to further those goals will help us expand 
and grow our economy. This bill presents Maine with the opportunity to be at the forefront of 
investment in areas of biotechnology and biomanufacturing. 
Again, please vote ought to pass on L.D. 1475.
