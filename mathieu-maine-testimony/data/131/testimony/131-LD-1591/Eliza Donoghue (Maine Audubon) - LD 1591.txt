RE: LD 1591, An Act to Promote Economic Reuse of Contaminated Land Through Clean 
Energy Development 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Committee: 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 1591, An Act to 
Promote Economic Reuse of Contaminated Land Through Clean Energy Development, on behalf 
of Maine Audubon and our 30,000 members, supporters, and volunteers. Maine Audubon 
supports this legislation because it will (l) help Maine reach its renewable energy goals; (2) 
support farmers whose lands are contaminated by PFAS and are no longer suitable for 
agricultural purposes; and (3) support “thoughtfully sited” renewable energy development, 
among other reasons. 
LD 1591 would establish a competitive procurement for 5% of Maine’s 2021 retail 
electricity sales ~ roughly 400 MW. The procurement would be open to Class 1A resources~ 
which include solar and terrestrial wind energy generation facilities — located on previously 
developed or impacted land, including brownﬁeld sites, as well as agricultural land where the 
discovery of PFAS contamination has prevented agricultural activity. The bill would also allow 
for bids with colocated energy storage systems and would beneﬁt ratepayers by favoring 
competitively priced projects. 
Maine Audubon’s interest in this legislation is multifaceted. As mentioned previously, we 
support the bill because it would create an economic opportunity for farmers whose lands have 
been devastated by PFAS contamination. Currently, there is no way to remediate PFAS 
contamination in soils. Farms across Maine are facing the fact that their land is no longer usable 
for agricultural purposes. This has enormous implications for the ﬁnancial stability of farmers 
and their families. Locating renewable energy projects on these lands would provide a revenue 
stream on otherwise unusable land. 
Locating renewable energy infrastructure on PFAS-contaminated lands, as well as 
previously developed or otherwise impacted lands (including brownﬁeld sites), is also a leading 
example of thoughtful renewable energy siting that balances clean energy and natural resource 
conservation goals. New renewable energy development — likely any new development — if not

not thoughtfully sited, can displace wildlife habitat and otherwise negatively impact Maine’s 
natural resources, including agricultural resources. The natural resource values (i.e., habitat for 
vulnerable plant and animal species, large forest blocks, prime agricultural soils, etc.) of 
PFAS-contaminated lands, brownﬁeld sites, or previously-developed lands are minimal. By 
incentivizing development on those lands, LD l59l would serve to help Maine to achieve its 
clean energy goals, as well as its natural resource conservation goals. 
For these reasons and more, we strongly encourage the Committee to support LD 1591. 
Sincerely,
