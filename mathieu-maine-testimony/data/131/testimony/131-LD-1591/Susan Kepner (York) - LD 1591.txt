LD 1591
 As a consumer of farm raised food in Maine , I am very concerned about it's quality 
and safety with the impact of PFAS in the soil and water.  Bill LD 1591 is a good way
to keep the food grown in safe areas and then help the farmer use his land for solar 
energy that is clean and also safe. Solar energy is clean and environmentally friendly. 
While we do NOT want to put solar farms on viable farm land, this bill will allow it to
be sited on unusable land, enabling the farmer to still benefit from the polluted land. It
is a win-win for the farmers and the people of Maine to get more affordable, CLEAN 
energy.
