Senator l.a\\'rence, Representative '/.eigler and distinguished members of the _]oint Standing 
(Iominittee on lii1ei.' _g_\" , Litilities, and ili 
echnology, 
.\ly name is \‘{J'illiam it 
laryyood and I am here today, as Public .'\d\"ocate, to testify neither for 
nor against 141) 1591, “;\n .\ct to Promote llconomic Reuse of (Iontaminated land Through (Ilean 
lﬂnergy Development. ” 
.\s you are well aware, .\laine has a gi?<>\ving crisis in trying to balance the need for 
subsidizing renexyable energy to meet our climate goals and the need to keep rates afli orclable. ;\laine 
detinitely needs more solar, but l worry that it the Pill focuses on subsidizing more solar on 
contaminated land rather than solar on land, we may end up with less solar and ’,/or higher rates. 
Before we ask ratepayers to subsidize the generation of electricity, we should be conﬁdent of three 
tliiiigs: (ll) the environmental and economic beneﬁts oi the renewable energy project are real and 
substantial; (Z1) a subsidy is necessary to achieve those beneﬁts: and the subsidy is the smallest 
amount necessary to achieve those beneﬁts. 
lhe ()l);\ recommends that any additional subsidy for solar on contaminated land come 
from the taxpayers through the budget process instead of placing an added burden on Maine 
ratepayers. 
lhank you for your time, attention, and consideration of this testimony. lhe Uftice of the 
l’ubl._ic ;\d\'ocate looks forward to \V()1‘l{lI1g with the (iommittee on Idl) l5‘)l and will be available for 
the work session to assist the Committee in its consideration of this bill.
