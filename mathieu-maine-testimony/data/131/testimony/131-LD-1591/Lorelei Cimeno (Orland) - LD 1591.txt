LD 1591
Honorable members of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology committee. My name is 
Lorelei Cimeno, and I am a farmer in Orland, Maine. I am writing to urge your 
support of LD 1591. As a farmer, I have felt the effects of climate change, and the 
impacts it has had on our business. We need more renewable energy to address 
climate change. More solar energy production is necessary. However, we need to 
preserve farmland to address climate change too. In Maine, we have a finite amount 
of farmland left that is undeveloped. We need to preserve as much of it as we can, so 
we can grow food for Mainers. LD 1591 provides a good solution for both of these 
problems, by encouraging solar siting on land that is significantly contaminated with 
PFAS. It helps Maine meet our climate goals without sacrificing limited and valuable 
farmland. It seems like a no-brainer to me. Thank you for your consideration.
