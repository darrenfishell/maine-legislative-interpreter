Re: Testimony in support of LD 1591, “An Act to Promote Economic Reuse of 
Contaminated Land Through Clean Energy Development ” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Govermnent Affairs Group 
here to testify in support of LD 1591 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable Energy 
Association (“MREA”). 
This legislation tasks the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with administering a clean energy 
procurement bid process to contract for 5% of Maine’s 2021 retail electricity sales — this will 
amount to approximately 400 megawatts being placed under contract. Importantly, this 
procurement will create opportunities for farmers and landowners whose lands have been 
contaminated by PFAS and other contaminants to ﬁnancially beneﬁt through hosting clean 
energy projects. 
Similar but not identical to the successful gri<i:§g;;_i§__iii"t>curcment of a few years ago, this 
legislation instructs the PUC‘ to apply a weighting of 70% on cost/ratepayer beneﬁt, and 30% on 
the economic reuse of contaminated lands. As it considers costs factors, the PUC may only 
award a contract if the pricing will be less than the standard offer electric supply price in the 
same year as the PUC makes its award. 
Clean energy developments may be the only use of the land that can be approved at this time 
given the potential for long-term health hazards of contaminated lands. There are also other 
beneﬁts contained in the Inﬂation Reduction Act offering incentives helping to drive down the 
costs of developing renewables on these lands. 
Lastly, placing additional clean energy projects under long-term contract will help shield Maine 
consumers in the future from wild price swings associated with natural gas. 
We respectfully urge you to vote ought to pass. 
Thank you.
