LD 1591
Hello,
I am writing the committee to urge passage of LD 1591. Maine, in general, and Maine
farms in particular face two pressing and existential threats: a rapidly shifting climate 
and PFAS contamination. This Act would make it possible to support farmers who 
have been impacted by PFAS to make the most valuable use of the land for sustaining
our economy and agriculture.
Please move this bill forward and support Maine farms.
