LD 1591
LD 1591 proposes measures to promote the economic reuse of developed, impacted, 
or contaminated land, including farmland impacted by PFAS, through renewable 
energy projects that guarantee ratepayer savings. Since research on PFAS remediation
methods is still ongoing and we are still pursuing understanding of the potential for 
successful remediation, I support inclusion of agricultural land where significant 
PFAS contamination, as identified by Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation
and Forestry, prevents further agricultural production in the near-term. This bill would
allow farmers to realize value from land that may need to be restricted from farming 
for years to come. By locating renewable energy development on developed, 
impacted or contaminated land, LD 1591 would also advance Maine’s clean energy 
goals without negatively impacting Maine’s working farmland and high-value 
agricultural soils.
