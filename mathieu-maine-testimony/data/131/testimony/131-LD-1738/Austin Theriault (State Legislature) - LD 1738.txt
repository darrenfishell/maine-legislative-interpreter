An Act to Create Lodging for Legislators 
 
Maine is one of the most rural states in the Country and for years legislators have 
either had to stay in hotels 4 nights a week and eat out, or look to purchase a house 
to have decent housing with access to a way to cook. Until recently, traveling 
Legislators have been paying out of pocket to serve their constituents, and the State 
was making out on the positive side for something that should have been righted 
years ago. Since the rate of reimbursement was increased, it did create another 
conversation. Is taxpayer funding better spent, being invested internally? Would it 
be a better long-term investment for taxpayers to build and fund Legislative 
Housing, rather than providing a flat reimbursement fee in perpetuity? What will 
the Legislature do when hotel rates continue to increase and we end up right back 
where we were before? Let’s take the time to investigate. Please support this Act, so 
these questions can be explored, and we can walk away with a long-term 
economically sustainable plan so we can continue to do the people’s work in 
Augusta.  
 
 
 
Sincerely,
