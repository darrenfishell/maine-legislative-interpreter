RE: in Support of LD 147 
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Veterans and Legal Affairs: 
l'm Representative Dick Bradstreet and l represent House District 61, which is comprised of 
my home town of Vassalboro and most of Sidney. I'm pleased to support LD»147, An Act to 
Increase the Amount of Money Allowed to Be Raised for a Charitable Purpose by Certain Raffles. 
The issue giving rise to this bill was brought to my attention by the Mid Maine Chamber of 
Commerce, whose members come from many municipalities in the Waterville area. Each year, 
the Chamber raises money for its various members and the Alfond Youth Center through its 
Festival of Trees. Individuals can enter into a raffle by purchasing raffle tickets for the many 
trees that are donated and decorated by local businesses. These businesses also donate gifts 
that are included with the winning tickets, and many people are only too happy to help add to 
the generosity of these donors by purchasing even more tickets than the MMCC has predicted. 
This past year, the generosity was so substantial that the total number of tickets purchased was 
on the brink of exceeding the state's current limit. By increasing this cap, Maine will be able to 
help with the ability of MMCC and other similar organizations to donate more funds to worthy 
charitable causes, something that is very important and timely given how much more things 
cost these days!' 
Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope you will vote LD 147 as Ought to Pass. 
Representative Dick Bradstreet
