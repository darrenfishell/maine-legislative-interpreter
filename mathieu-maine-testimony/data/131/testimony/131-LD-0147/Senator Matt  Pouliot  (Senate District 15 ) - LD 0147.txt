TESTIMONY OF SENATOR MATTHEW POULIOT   
In Support of LD 147     
“An Act to Increase the Amount of Money Allowed to Be Raised for a Charitable Purpose by Certain 
Raffles”  
Public Hearing:   Monday, January 30, 2023  
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee  on Veterans and 
Legal Affairs. I am Senator Matt Pouliot and I represent Senate District 15, which includes the towns of 
Augusta, Belgrade, China, Mount Vernon, Sidney and Vassalboro.  I am writing in support of LD 147 “An 
Act to Increase the Amount of Mon ey Allowed to Be Raised for a Charitable Purpose by Certain Raffles.”  
 
This bill would help organizations in my district such as the Augusta Downtown Alliance and the Augusta 
Elks raise more at the annual festival of trees that they hold each year. These events are attended by a 
number of individuals each year and are successful events. They raise money to help a number of other 
organizations, schoolchildren, veterans, elderly and  the list goes on.  
 
We should be allowing these organizations to raise as much money as possible and not have roadblocks in 
place by the State of Maine. The more money they raise the more they can do for our communities and 
make them a better place to liv e and work.  
 
Thank for your time and I ask that you please support this legislation.
