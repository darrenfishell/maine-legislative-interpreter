As the need for more and more funds to be raised by various organizations throughout
our State for so many great causes so does the need to come up with fundraisers that 
will have a bigger impact on those budgets. We are all extremely busy, and limiting 
the amount of dollars that can be raised at a fundraiser, not only prevents 
organizations from raising the funds they need for all that they are doing, it also 
means more fundraisers need to be organized and executed.  We are all aware of the 
current labor shortage in Maine, well the volunteer shortage is just as significant. As 
organizations, we need the opportunity to make more money during our fundraisers to
maximize the volunteers that we do have and not burn them out with numerous 
events.  Thank you for your consideration.
