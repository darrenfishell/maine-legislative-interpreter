District 65: Waterville (part)Testimony from Representative Bruce White in Support of LD 147
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs: 
My name is Representative Bruce White and I proudly represent District 65 which consists of 
part of the City of Waterville in the Maine House of Representatives.  I write to this committee 
in support of LD 147, An Act to Increase the Amount of Money Allowed to Be Raised for a 
Charitable Purpose by Certain Raffles sponsored by Senator Dave LaFountain.
I have worked with many charitable organizations in my lifetime, and I know the funds that are 
raised by organizations using raffles do so much good to assist those in need. For example, 
raising the limit for non-cash prizes using raffles from $75,000 to $125,000 and doubling the 
amount of the cash prizes will allow eligible organizations to expand their reach with the 
community and will serve as a great tool for additional fundraising for good causes.
I personally know there are many organizations in Waterville that would greatly benefit from the 
proposed changes in LD 147. I am grateful for Sen. LaFountainâ€™s leadership on this issue that 
benefits not only Kennebec County but the entire state.  I strongly urge the Veterans and Legal 
Affairs Committee to move LD 147 forward to be considered by the full body of the Maine 
Legislature this session. 
Thank you so much for your consideration of my testimony.  If there is any additional assistance 
I can provide in your consideration of LD 147, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Best, 
Representative Bruce White
