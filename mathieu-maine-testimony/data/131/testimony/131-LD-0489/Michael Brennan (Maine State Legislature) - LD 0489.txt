Testimony of Representative Michael Brennan Introducing 
LD 489, An Act to Provide Equal Educational Opportunity by Adopting Rules 
Ensuring Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Protected Class Status in Educational 
Institutions 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Aﬂairs 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty and esteemed colleagues of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee. My name is Michael Brennan, and I am proud to serve as the co-chair of this Committee and 
sponsor of LD 489, An Act to Provide Equal Educational Opportunity by Adopting Rules Ensuring 
Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Protected Class Status in Educational Institutions. 
This bill is simple. It has been over two decades since the Maine Human Rights Commission and the 
Maine Department of Education have updated their joint rules related to preventing discrimination in 
public schools. In order to ensure the promise and fulﬁll the obligation to students guaranteed to them 
under the Maine Human Rights Act — that the public schools they attend be inclusive and safe learning 
environments for all — free from discrimination regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation or gender 
identity, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or national origin, it is time that these outdated 
rules be revised. 
In the past twenty years we have experienced shifts and changes in our laws, best practices, demographics 
and our understanding of how best to support all students ’ ability to learn. This bill will ensure that our 
non-discrimination rules are updated to reflect these changes. 
An update to the mles will also support our public schools by providing clarity and up-to-date guidance 
on best practices so that they may fulﬁll their obligation to the students and communities they serve and 
so they may protect against discrimination, as guaranteed under the Maine Human Rights Act.
