TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 489 
AN ACT TO PROVIDE EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY BY ADOPTING 
RULES ENSURING NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF PROTECTED 
. CLASS STATUS IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 489. 
Superintendents and School Boards are committed as school leaders to assure that all persons in our schools— 
students and staff — are treated with respect and not discriminated against regardless of their sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, disabilities, sex or sexual orientation, national origin, race, color or religion. 
Public schools must be safe havens for all the students we serve and the persons we employ. 
We therefore support the review of the rules around unlawful educational discrimination in Title 5 under the 
timelines specified in this bill to reinforce the message that discrimination for any reason will be investigated 
and not tolerated. 
It also is important there are lines of communication open in schools to allow persons who feel discriminated 
against to make their concerns known without fear of retaliation. That line of communication often starts with 
school counselors and social workers.
