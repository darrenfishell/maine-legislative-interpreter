Testimony in Opposition to LD 489, An Act to Provide Equal Educational Opportunity by Adopting Rules 
Ensuring Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Protected Class Status in Educational Institution
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:
Thank you for accepting this testimony in opposition to LD 489. My name is Jon Reisman. I have recently 
retired after 38 years at the University of Maine at Machias as an associate professor of economics and 
public policy. For a decade I was chair of the Professional Studies division which housed the Education 
program. In the 90’s I served as a special projects manager in the King administration, getting rid of car 
testing and rejecting school administration consolidation. I am a Selectman for the Town of Cooper, a 
weekly columnist for two Washington County weeklies and a Statler and Waldorf intern.
My opposition to LD 489 stems from concerns that the bill will:
Use opaque rulemaking to accomplish what the legislature was unwilling or unable to 
accomplish with regards to gender, sexuality, curriculum transparency, parental notification, 
First Amendment (free speech and religious freedom) and local control policies;
Reduce local control;
Under the cover of “best practices”:
oExpand “anti-racist” equity efforts that justify discrimination and racial preferences
oSustain affirmative action policies the Supreme Court is poised to strike down
oExtend the malign indoctrination influence the Maine Education Association continues 
to exercise on our children in public schools.
I would be glad to answer any questions at jreisman@maine.edu
