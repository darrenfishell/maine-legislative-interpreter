Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 489 An Act to Provide Equal Educational Opportunity by Adopting Rules Ensuring 
Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Protected Class Status in Educational Institutions , proposes t o 
require the Commissioner of Education  (DOE)  and the Maine Human Rights Commission  
(MHRC)  to review the rules made under Title 5, chapter 337, subchapter 5 -B on or before 
January 15, 2024, and at least once every 10 years thereafter. The bill also directs the 
Department of Education and the Maine Hu man Rights Commission to initiate rulemaking as 
soon as practicable if the review determines that amendments to the rules are necessary.  
Chapter 4: Equal Education Opportunity Regulations was repealed and replaced in 2000. Chapter 
4-A: Procedural Rule: Edu cation Opportunity Regulations was also re pealed and replaced in 
2000 and has been subsequently amended in 2010 and 2012. Since 2012, there have been 
statutory updates to the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA) that require corresponding changes 
in rule. Through  our on -going collaboration with the MHRC, the DOE will continue to cr aft 
rules that promote education, excellence, and equity for all Maine learners by ensuring that the 
rules reflect the policy of the MHRA, which  promotes inclusion and seeks to prevent 
discrimination.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 489 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Megan Welter  
Associate Commissioner of Public Education
