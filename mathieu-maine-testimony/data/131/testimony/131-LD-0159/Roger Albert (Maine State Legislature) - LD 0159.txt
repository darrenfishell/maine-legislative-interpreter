Good Morning Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and distinguished members 
of the Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry Committee. I am State Representative 
Roger Albert of Madawaska. I am currently serving my ﬁrst term in the Maine House of 
Representatives and I serve parts of the St. John Valley. 
I am honored to stand before you today to present my bill, LD 159 “An Act to Facilitate 
the Construction of a Firehouse by Sinclair Township ” Sinclair Township currently hasa 
ﬁre station building on leased land which belongs to the Diocese of Portland. At this 
time, the recently purchased ﬁretruck barely ﬁts in its current building. 5 inches in the 
front, and 5 inches in the back when the doors are closed. Sinclair Township is looking to 
purchase land and construct a Fire Station Building that will give them the space to 
provide maintenance on the truck, after a ﬁre emergency. The ﬁre station in Sinclair 
covers a majority of the unorganized territory in the area. 
At this time, Sinclair has a population of just under 400 and is currently in an 
Unorganized Territory. Ryan Pelletier, Aroostook County Commissioner has bolstered 
support for this legislation, as it would beneﬁt this ever- growing community. 
The cost of this project as researched by the County Commissioner would be in the area 
of $85 0,000 and would include land acquisition and construction of the ﬁre station. The 
land area would be approximately 10 acres. 
I would ask this cormnittee here today to seriously consider the impact a new ﬁre station 
would make not only for Sinclair but for the large portion of the Unorganized Territory it 
services. 
Sincerely,
