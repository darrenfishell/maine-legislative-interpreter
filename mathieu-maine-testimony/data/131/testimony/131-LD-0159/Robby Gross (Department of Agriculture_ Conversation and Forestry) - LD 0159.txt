Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry ,  
 
LD 159 , An Act to Facilitate the Construction of a Firehouse by Sinclair Township , is a concept 
draft  that does not provide sufficient information for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry (DACF) to take a position on the bill before us today.  
However, after speaking with the bill sponsor, we understand that the existing pre -commission 
firehouse is on a small lot in Sinclair Village on a property that Sinclair Township does not own.  
This fire station is part of a holistic North Lakes Fire Depar tment and a much -needed entity in the 
North.  The Maine Forest Service (MFS) works hand in hand with them regularly, and they play a vital 
role in our fire program response in northern Maine.  
If this proposal is developed further, department staff would hap pily attend an upcoming work session 
to answer any questions the Committee may have.  
 
Sincerely , 
 
Robby Gross, Chief Forest Ranger  
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry  
Maine Forest Service, Division of Forest Protection
