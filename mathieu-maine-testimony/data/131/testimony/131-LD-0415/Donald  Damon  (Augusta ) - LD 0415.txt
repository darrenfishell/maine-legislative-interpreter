Since the law change, we can no longer get sparkling cider for our customers that use 
it as a non alcoholic beverage for toasts, etc.  I believe this was an unintended 
consequence of the law and an adjustment is necessary to keep our options open and 
continue to serve our customers. I believe that all retailers, customers, and even cider 
makers would be okay with sparkling non-alcoholic cider being made legal to be 
available in the state of Maine again. 
Thank you
