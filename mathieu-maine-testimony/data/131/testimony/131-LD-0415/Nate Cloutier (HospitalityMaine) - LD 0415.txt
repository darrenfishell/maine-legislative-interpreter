Testimony of Nate Cloutier
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
March 15, 2023
In Support of LD 415, “An Act to Allow Nonalcoholic Sparkling Cider to Be Sold in Maine”
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and distinguished members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry: My name is Nate Cloutier, and I am here today on behalf of HospitalityMaine 
to offer support of LD 415. HospitalityMaine represents more than 1,200 restaurant and lodging operators 
of all sizes across the state.
We thank Senator Pouliot for submitting this legislation that fixes an unintended consequence in Maine’s 
existing cider laws. P.L. 2021 Chapter 111 enacted a law that prohibited any product labeled as “cider” 
from being sold if that product was heat treated. At the time, proponents of the legislation said this would 
promote fresh refrigerated cider produced from Maine orchards as opposed to cider that is imported from 
further away that is often heat-treated as a preservation measure.   
This law requires that any heat-treated apple cider offered for sale would need to be re-named. 
Unfortunately, non-alcoholic sparkling cider such as the brand “Martinelli” for example, is always heat 
treated and was not exempted from the law and is no longer able to be sold in Maine. Large companies 
like Martinelli are not going to create a label reading “sparkling apple juice” just for the state of Maine. Our 
members have enjoyed using tasty Martinelli’s sparkling cider as an alternative to champagne for most 
functions in their establishments and would like to be able to offer it again. 
LD 415 simply adds an exemption to the existing cider law by allowing for the sale of sparkling cider by 
larger companies like Martinelli while still preserving the original intent of the 2021 law. We urge you to 
vote ought to pass on LD 415. 
Thank you for your attention. I would be happy to answer any questions.
