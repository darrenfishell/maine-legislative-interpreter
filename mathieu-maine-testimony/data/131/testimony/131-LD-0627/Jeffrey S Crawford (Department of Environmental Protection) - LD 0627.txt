LD 627, An Act To Promote Clean and Affordable Maine-sourced Bioenergy by Amending the Law 
Regarding Outdoor Wood Boilers and Outdoor Pellet Boilers

Public Hearing: March 1, 2023

Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, l am 
Jeffrey S. Crawford, Director of the Bureau of Air Quality at the Department of 
Environmental Protection, speaking in opposition to L.D.627 
Maine families, businesses, and industries have a long tradition of burning wood to 
provide heat, hot water, steam, and electricity. The Department of Environmental 
Protection supports the responsible, efﬁcient, sustainable use of wood by Maine families 
and businesses to provide heat and hot water either as a primary or back-up source. 
Outdoor wood and pellet boilers have been used in Maine for many years, and in many 
cases, without incidence. However, in some cases, the use of outdoor wood and pellet 
boilers results in neighbors being impacted by odors, smoke, and other forms of air 
pollution from these devices. 
lt was these impacts that prompted the Legislature to direct the Department to regulate 
air emissions from outdoor wood and pellet boilers in 2007. In response, the 
Department adopted Chapter 150, entitled Control of Emissions from Outdoor Wood 
Boilers. Chapter 150 was submitted to EPA and approved as part of Maine’s State 
implementation Plan (SIP). As part of Maine’s SIP, Chapter 150 is federally 
enforceable, and any relaxation of its requirements would trigger EPA’s anti-backsliding 
provisions. 
Regardless of the legal ramiﬁcations in relaxing the standards, there are also real-world 
implications. The Department receives, responds to, and works to resolve dozens of 
complaints about these impacts each year statewide. Complaints about emissions from 
outdoor wood boilers are some of the most controversial and time-consuming 
complaints we deal with. Outdoor wood boiler complaints make up approximately 10% 
of the complaints we receive.

Chapter 150 contains requirements associated with the sale, installation, and operation 
of outdoor wood and pellet boilers including emission standards, set-back requirements, 
stack height requirements, operating requirements, and nuisance standards. ln 
accordance with Chapter 150, outdoor wood and pellet boilers sold and installed after 
April 1, 2010, must be certified to meet a particulate matter emission limit of 0.32 
lb/MMBtu on a heat output basis; the applicable set-back (50 feet from the nearest 
property line or 70 feet from the nearest dwelling); and stack height requirements (10 
feet above ground level or 2 feet higher than the peak of the structure being served, if 
an abutting residence is located less than 300 feet from the boiler) contained in 
Sections 3(B) and 3(C), respectively. An outdoor wood boiler certified to meet a lower 
particulate matter emission limit of 0.06 lb/MMBtu on a heat output basis is not subject 
to a set-back requirement if it meets the stack height requirements just described. 
LD 627, as proposed, would remove the set-back requirements for any outdoor wood or 
pellet boiler meeting a particulate matter emission limitof 0.32 lb/MMBtu on a heat 
output basis. This change would essentially allow all outdoor wood or pellet boilers 
(new or existing) to be installed in accordance with the applicable stack height 
requirements but with no set-back requirements, potentially to be located right up 
against a neighbor ’s property line. Based on the Departments experience, this change 
would significantly increase the number of complaints that we receive about outdoor 
wood boilers and would significantly increase the potential exposure of Maine citizens to 
emissions from outdoor wood boilers. ln our experience, the closer an outdoor wood 
boiler is to a neighboring property, the more likely neighbors are to be impacted by 
emissions from those units, and the more likely we are to receive complaints from the 
neighbors about odor, smoke, or other air pollutants. 
Chapter 150 currently includes a prohibition on nuisance smoke, such that no outdoor 
wood boiler or outdoor pellet boiler is allowed to operate if it produces visible emissions 
that cross onto an adjacent property for more than 12 minutes in any hour. LD 627,as

proposed, would also remove the nuisance condition criteria currently contained in 
Chapter 150 and would prevent the Department from establishing nuisance condition 
criteria to protect neighbors by prohibiting smoke from an outdoor wood boiler to cross 
onto a neighbor ’s property. This proposed change would severely hamper the 
Departments ability to address smoke-related complaints from people living adjacent to 
one or more outdoor wood boilers. The remaining recourse for impacted neighbors, 
other than through local ordinances, would be to seek resolution through the courts. 
As noted in my testimony for L.D. 400, the Department is supportive of efforts to 
examine setback and other requirements for outdoor wood boilers. At the same time, 
eliminating setback and visible emission (smoke) requirements forthese units is 
premature without a more fully developed understanding of emissions from both older 
generation (0.32 lb/MMBtu) and newer (0.10 lb/MMBtu) units. 
Thank you for your consideration in allowing this testimony. l’m joined here today by 
Bureau of Air Quality Licensing and Compliance Division staff, and together we would 
be happy to answer any questions that you might have.
