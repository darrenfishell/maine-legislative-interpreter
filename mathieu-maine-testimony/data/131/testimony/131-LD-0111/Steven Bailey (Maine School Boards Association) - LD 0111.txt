TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1 ll 
AN ACT REQUIRING THE STATE TO PAY A SHARE OF A RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEE ’S OR 
RETIRED TEACHER’S PREMIUM FOR MEDICARE PART B UNDER MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing. I am Steven 
Bailey, executive director for Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative 
committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents Association in 
support ofL.D. 111. 
Our members support this bill because it recognizes that it is a burden on many retired teachers to pay 
Medicare Part B premiums out of their pensions. 
This bill recognizes that pension beneﬁts differ for teachers, and essentially establishes a sliding scale based 
on the amount of their retirement beneﬁt. That scale goes from 100 percent to IO percent. 
We think this is a fair proposal and one that is overdue.
