My name is Michael A. Pinkham, I dedicated over 30 years of my life to the State Of 
Maine as a Maine Marine Patrol, protecting the marine resources of this State. I was 
told when I was hired that my Health Insurance would be paid by the State for my 
lifetime. It was disappointing that when I reached 65 years of age and found that I had
to start paying for Medicare Part B. I am only one of many State Employees who have
to step and pay for something that we were told would be taken care of. I appreciate 
your time and consideration in this matter. Thank You Retired Marine Patrol Office
