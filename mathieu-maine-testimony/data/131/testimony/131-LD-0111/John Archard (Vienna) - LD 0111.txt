TESTIMONY OF JOHN ARCHARD IN SUPPORT OF  
LD 111  
 
 Representative Tipping , Representative Roeder , members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee . My name is John Archard and I live in the Town of Vienna. I retired 
after serving 15 years as the State’ s first Tobacco Control Coordinator in the Attorney 
General ’s Office. I am testifying for LD111. I  have been a member of the state retiree ’s 
associati on since retiring and am  covered by the Maine Retirees Medicare Advantage 
Plan. I am in support of the proposal for the State to cover the additional Medicare 
Premium currently deducted f rom what I receive from Social Security. I currently suffer 
from Idio pathic Pulmonary Fibrosis which is incurable but can be treated with a lung 
transplant. Because there is no lung transplant program in Maine,  I have to travel to 
Boston for extensive testing to be considered for transplant. Just last week two trips were necessary. The Advantage plan does not cover the cost of travel for this testing which is significant.  The added coverage of the Medicare premium would help defray 
such costs.  
 My wife is also a PERS Retiree as a former school librarian. She does not 
receive the State’ s Medicare Advantage plan but also has the Medicare premium 
deducted from her already significantly reduced social security due to the Government Pension Offset provision. I would caution that if passed adding the Medicare premium to 
her PERS al location may adversely affect  the already considerable Government 
Pension offset.  
 Thank you for your consideration and I urge you to vote for this legislation,
