Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, Member of the Labor and Housing Committee. 
My name is Harold Booth, i live in Hallowell, and l'm a retired state employee, retiring in 1996. 
For most of my retirement, the State has paid for my health insurance, but when I reached 65, I became 
eligible for Medicare as a result of my spouse's Social Security qualification. When that happened, I had 
to move to Medicare and start paying the Medicare premium. 
Last week l called the state office that deals with employee health insurance matters. l wanted to 
ascertain what the difference in the state's cost was between paying the ‘full freight’ for a retiree's 
health insurance and the Aetna supplemental coverage that the state buys for Medicare-eligible 
retirees. 
The full-freight coverage is just above $995/month, while the Aetna supplemental is just above 
$237/m0., saving the state approximately $758/mo. ln the meantime, l now have to pay the Medicare 
premium [currently a bit north of$ 500/quarter] almost 10% of my pension. 
When I started with the state, they paid for my health insurance, and when l vested, that obligation 
extended until the end of my life. Because of my spouse's qualification, l became eligible for Medicare, 
but l don't think that should relieve the state of its obligation to pay for my health insurance until l die. 
Given that my being on Medicare saves the state a boatload of money, I think it's only fair that the state 
pick up the cost of my Medicare premium.
