Dear Labor and Housing Committee,
     I and my wife are both retired teachers; I from middle school at Elm Street School in 
Mechanic Falls, and her from 2nd grade at Poland Community School in Poland.  As such, 
we are comfortable, mostly because we built our own home in 1973, living in a tent for 6 
months.  So, no mortgage now for some time.  We're not destitute.
     But my retirement social security from various other jobs including 4 years in the USN, is 
cut nearly in half by the WEP law (a law Susan Collins has promised to fight for 
decades...not).  Both of us are cut with health care costs taken out.  We taught your children 
well for very minimal wages.  We could use the help LD 111 would afford us.  Please vote 
"ought to pass".
