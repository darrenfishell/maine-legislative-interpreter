Thank you Honorable Chairmen and Committee members for considering this change
in how much money that retired state employees and teachers are required to pay for 
health insurance premiums.  This has been a great burden for both my husband and 
myself after having been promised those fees would be covered by the state based on 
the number of years employees had been in the system.  We were also targeted for 
other cuts in our pensions at the time as well, that have made surviving on this 
reduced income for retirement a struggle.  I have had to take on part time jobs to 
make things work financially at a time when my health costs and issues are 
increasing.
Since many of us were forced to retire or lose that coverage back in 2012 itâ€™s finally 
time to honor the states previous promises.  We were targeted by the then gov Lepage 
to take an unfair burden of losses at that time.
Please help to restore what we were promised back then.
