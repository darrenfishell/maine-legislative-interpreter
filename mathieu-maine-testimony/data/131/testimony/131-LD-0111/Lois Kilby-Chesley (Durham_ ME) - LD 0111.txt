From Lois Kilby-Chesley
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee.
My name is Lois Kilby-Chesley and I am writing to you from my home in Durham, 
ME.
I am writing in support of LD 111 - Requiring the State to Pay a Share of a Retired 
State Employee’s or Retired Teacher's Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare 
Advantage.
I was a career teacher in Maine.  I contributed to MEPERS for 32 years, and I retired 
a few years ago. I also contributed to Social Security in other states at the beginning 
of my career and every summer and during some school years, as I supplemented my 
teaching salary which was never enough to pay all the bills as I raised two sons. I 
worked hard in both the classroom and in second jobs.  One would think that in 
retirement I could relax - and at the least - pay the bills.
Here’s what I am experiencing:
As you know GPO/WEP impacts educators in Maine so the amount I should be 
eligible for from Social Security has been reduced in my retirement.
My MEPERS check does not keep up with the pace of inflation.  Each year I have 
less spendable money for items I need but that are beyond how far I can stretch the 
check.  When inflation is 5.4% but COLA is 3% (even 4%), I have less to spend. 
Most recently inflation was 9.1% and the COLA was 3%.  This puts me in the 
position of having to decide what is most crucial to pay and buy since I have less and 
less money to purchase necessities.
Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!  If the State is able to pay a share 
of retired teachers’ Medicare Part B premium under a Medicare Advantage plan I 
would have more spendable income and would find some emotional relief on the days
bills come due.
Thank you for the work you do and for helping teacher retirees.
