RE: LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens ‘ Second Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of 
Firearms on Private Property That ls Within 500 Feet of School Property 
Members of the committee, l would like to express my Support of LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens ‘ 
Second Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That Is Within 500 Feet of 
School Property 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. l am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member. 
This bill simply affirms the Federal and Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. This right does not 
disappear simply because they live within 500ft of School property. 
Maine Title 17-A SS104 speciﬁes deadly force, but does not prohibit such action within 500ft of school property. 
The right to self defense should not be infringed simply due to the exercise of that right. Should Grandma ora 
single mother go to jail for defending herself’? No, this is a gap that should be closed. 
Please support closing the gap in the law, by supporting this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor 
Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun Owners of Maine
