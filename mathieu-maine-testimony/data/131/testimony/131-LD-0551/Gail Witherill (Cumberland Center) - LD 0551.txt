RE: LD 551 - An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second Amendment Rights by 
Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That Is Within 500 Feet 
of School Property in Certain Circumstances 
 
 
Dear Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, 
 
My name is Gail Witherill and I live in Cumberland.  I am writing to urge you to 
vote ONTP on LD 551.  More firearms in public do not make us safer.  In fact, it is 
the opposite as research already shows.  People allowed to have fireams  within 
500 feet of a school property , even if they are on private property,  does not make 
our schools safer.  Given the active shooter drills the kids already go thru, gun fire 
close to schools will exacerbate the situation.  Can you imagine how studentsâ€™ 
mental health will deteriorate even more?  Someone firing a gun within 500 feet 
of a school in the midst of an active shooter drill will cause undue stress and 
harm to the kids.  Just say NO to LD 551.   
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gail Witherill 
Cumberland
