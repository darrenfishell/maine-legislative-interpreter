LD 551
Dear members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee.
I urge you to oppose LD 551. Scientific research has shown that when more people 
are carrying firearms in public, violent crime rates rise. I want to feel safe in my 
community and I want families of school children to feel safe so firearms should not 
be allowed within 500 feet of school property. Please follow the science.
