LD 551
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
My name is Carol Riley, and I am a resident of Cumberland Center. I am opposed to 
the bill LD551. We don't even need to know that the research shows that when more 
people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime rates rise. It is apparent all over 
this country that we need tighter gun laws, not looser ones. To keep our children safe, 
firearms should not be allowed within 500 feet of school property. An overwhelming 
majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed citizens in or near places like 
schools would make their jobs harder.
I am asking for your "no" vote on this bill.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Carol Riley
