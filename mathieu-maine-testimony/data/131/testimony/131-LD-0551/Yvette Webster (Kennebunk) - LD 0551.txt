LD 551
Testimony of  Yvette Webster before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee regarding my opposition of LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' 
Second Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private 
Property That Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances.
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is  Yvette Webster and I am a resident of Kennebunk. I am a parent of young 
children. 
I oppose LD 551 because research shows that when more people are carrying firearms
in public, violent crime rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms 
should not be allowed within 500 feet of school property where children are playing 
and learning. A majority of law enforcement officers agree that guns have no place 
anywhere near schools.
Gun violence prevention measures for our schools should focus on educating kids and
parents about the dangers of firearms and importance of secure storage.
