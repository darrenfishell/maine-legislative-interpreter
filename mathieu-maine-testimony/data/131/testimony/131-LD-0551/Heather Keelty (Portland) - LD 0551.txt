LD 551
Distinguished members of the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name 
is Heather Keelty and I’m a resident of Portland. I am a mother of two young children
and although I have fortunately never been a victim of gun violence, seeing it in the 
news day, after day is wearing. I I am strongly opposing Bill LD551 and believe this 
will make schools more unsafe. Research shows that when people are carrying 
firearms in public violent crime rates rise, we want to keep our family safe so gun 
should not be within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and 
learning. I want my children to grow up feeling safe from the stress of gun violence. 
Federal and state laws ensuring that schools are gun free zones help make K-12 
school safer significantly reducing gun violence in these places, just look at the mass 
shootings as of the last few years. I don’t want Maine Schools to be next on that list.
