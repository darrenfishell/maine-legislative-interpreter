Testimony of Kristin Ricci,
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within
500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances. 
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Kristin Ricci and I am a resident of Scarborough. 
• Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent 
crime rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be 
allowed within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning.
• An overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed citizens in 
or near places like schools would make their jobs harder.
