LD 551
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:
My name is Kathleen Gibbons, and I am a resident of Old Orchard Beach. As a 
mother and grandmother, I OPPOSE this bill (LD 551) and I urge you to do the same. 
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning. In 
addition, an overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed 
citizens in or near places like schools would make their jobs harder.
Please vote against this bill.
