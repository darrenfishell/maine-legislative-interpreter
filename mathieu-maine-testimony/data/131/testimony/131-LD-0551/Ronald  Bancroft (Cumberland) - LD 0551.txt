Ronald  Bancroft
Cumberland
LD 551
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Ronald Bancroft  and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am a Maine native and
have grown up hunting and fishing in my home state. I am also a graduate of the U.S. 
Naval Academy and a Vietnam veteran.
I am writing to oppose LD 551. Let's leave the discharge of firearms in proximity to 
schools to law enforcement, the professionals.
