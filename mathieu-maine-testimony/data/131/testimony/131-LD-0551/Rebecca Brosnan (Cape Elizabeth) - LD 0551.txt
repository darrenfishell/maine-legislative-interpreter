LD 551
I am strongly opposed to LD 551. As a mother of two kids in Maine public schools, I 
cannot think of a worse idea than adding more guns to the equation. We need to pass 
laws to expand background checks, ban assault weapons and bump stocks, and 
require insurance for gun owners.
2nd Amendment rights should not trump all our other rights, including our right to 
public safety. 2nd Amendment rights should not make it easier for our kids to be shot 
in school. The 2nd Amendment has been misinterpreted and politicized, and people 
are being killed because of it. Enough is enough! 
My kids are thankfully not scared of being shot at school because we've managed to 
shield them, for now, from the disgusting reality in this country that guns are the #1 
cause of death for kids. 2nd Amendment fanatics are dangerous and delusional. Maine
must put the right to public safety above the right to own a gun.
