Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning. 
An overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed citizens in or
near places like schools would make their jobs harder.
