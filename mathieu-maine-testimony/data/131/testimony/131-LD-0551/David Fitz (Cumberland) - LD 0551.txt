LD 551 May 8, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee. 
My name is David Fitz. I live in Cumberland, Maine. I am a retired hand surgeon and plastic 
surgeon - I worked at the Maine Medical Center and Mercy Hospital having arrived as a surgery 
resident 43 years ago. 
I am a firearm owner and hunter, and was at one time certified to be a hunter safety instructor. I 
participated in a successful moose hunt in the North Maine Woods last fall. 
I am here today to oppose LD 551, An Act to “Strengthen ” Maine Citizens ’ 2nd Amendment 
Rights By Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property that is within 500 Feet of 
School Property in Certain Circumstances. 
This bill is actually a proposal to create a “stand your ground” law through a vague association 
with the safe zone around our schools. 
The bill also has nothing to do with strengthening my 2nd Amendment rights, and I don’t 
understand the phraseology. 
Maine does not need a “stand your ground” law, unless we are prepared to see what has 
happened around the country: 2 girls getting in the wrong car; a boy going to the wrong house 
to pick up his siblings; 2 girls driving to the wrong house: all being shot.' 
This bill as written is vague and inappropriate, as it is in direct conflict with Maine’s duty to_ 
retreat. 
Around the country where such laws have been passed, homicide rates have increased and 
such laws have been used by criminals as a defense.'

I refer you to a January 10, 2023 paper by the Rand Corporation. This is an updated accurate 
statistical analysis of “Effects of Stand-Your-Ground Laws on \ﬁolent Crime.” It is a review 
article that critiques all studies and statistics over the last 24 years. Below is the reference:

crime.html‘ 
We do not need LD 551 in Maine, and I hope you will vote “Ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
