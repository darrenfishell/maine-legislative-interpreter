LD 551
I'm writing in support of LD 551, "An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances." 
As we all know, current law prohibits a person from discharging a firearm within 500 
feet of public school property or the property of an approved private school. This bill 
establishes an exception for the discharge of a firearm by a person residing on private 
property for the purposes of self-defense or in order to protect the person's residence. 
This bill is a common sense measure to ensure that a persons inherent rights to protect
life and property isn't infringed. I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 
551.
Sincerely, James M Waite
