Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury and members of this Committee. 
I am here today in support of LDs 551, 624, 943, 1451 and 1561 and request an 
Ought to Pass for these bills. 
LD551 Returning the right of self defense and not being arrested for it because 
you live too close to a school seems to be a commonsense thing to do. The right 
to live should have never been taken from them. 
LD624 History is full of examples where government lists of certain people have 
been subject to being misused, subjugated and sometimes even eventually being 
murdered or imprisoned for being on that list. Even here in Maine there is recent 
example where of a list of Concealed Carry permit holders was being sought by 
the BDN for purpose of publishing it in the public domain. That was done in NY 
and the permit holders there were harassed, stalked and threated because they 
owned guns. It also provided a public map for thieves and robbers where they 
knew guns were kept, and that, is never a good thing! 
LD943 Much the same reasons as above plus, no civilian company should ever 
have access to a data base like this. Such a thing would be ripe for misuse. 
LD 1451 I ﬁnd this to be quite similar to a bill being heard this afternoon andI 
support both of them. 
LD1561 I wholly support this bill. I have a brother that is not and never wasa 
violent person. His right to hunt with a ﬁrearm was stripped over 40 years ago 
when he was young and maybe not so smart. He ﬁbbed to an ofﬁcer which had his 
charges elevated for a minor crime. He has raised children that are good, 
contributing members of society, just like their father. He's never been arrested 
since and I believe, has earned back his rights. 
Respectfully,
