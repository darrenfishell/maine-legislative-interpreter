LD 551
Testimony of Caroline Culbertson (Pownal, Maine) before the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances,
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning.
Additionally, an overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed
citizens in or near places like schools would make their jobs harder.
Please vote “ought not to pass” on this bill. We should be tightening gun laws, not 
loosening them, when gun related deaths have now become the LEADING cause of 
death for children and teens.
