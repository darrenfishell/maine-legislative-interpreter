LD 551
My name is Kristen Verrico and I live in Scarborough Maine and am writing in 
opposition of LD551. 
I have two children, a daughter who is 5 and entering kindergarten in the fall and a 
son who is 8 and will enter third grade. I spend an inordinate amount of time worrying
about the safety of my children in their schools or in public. 
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. Firearms should absolutely not be permitted within 500 feet of school 
property. In fact, I believe this distance should be much further. 
I'm deeply disappointed that this act is even in consideration at a time when we need 
stricter gun laws, not looser.
