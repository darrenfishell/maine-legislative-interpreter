I grew up in a home that was near an elementary school. Our back yard was near the 
school playground. Once in a while, a soccer ball would bounce onto our back yard. 
The students would come and retrieve it - no problem. With this law, if the 
homeowner who lives near a school felt threatened by a soccer ball on his lawn, he or 
she could shoot the child who had the nerve to walk onto his lawn. In court, he would 
say "I felt threatened." It doesn't matter if the parents of that dead child say - "but my 
child had no gun" or "why didn't you turn and go back into your home." That man 
would - very likely - not be charged with murder. He would be within the law, to 
stand his ground. 
Please reject this law. It does not specify what defending property is. It does not 
require a reasonable justification for shooting an intruder - even to intrude onto his 
lawn, let alone his home.
Our Maine children have been lucky to not have been shot - yet. This law is disaster 
in the making.
