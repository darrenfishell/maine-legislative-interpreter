TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 551 
 
AN ACT TO STRENGTHEN MAINE CITIZENS’ SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS BY  
ALLOWING THE DISCHARGE OF FIREARMS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT IS WITHIN  
500 FEET OF SCHOOL PROPERTY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES  
 
Senator Beebe -Center , Represen tative Salisbury, and members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety, I am Victoria Wallack, director of communications and government relations for Maine School 
Management Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards 
Associ ation and Maine School Superintendents Association in opposition to L.D. 551.  
 
The exceptions in the  law prohibiting a firearm within 500 feet of school property  were narrowly defined 
intentionally to make it clear we don’t want guns on or near school prop erty. The law has been on the books 
in Maine since 2009, and we believe most gun owners have long been aware of the prohibition.  This would 
include the discharge of a firearm within 500 feet of school property. Discharge of a firearm within 500 feet 
of school property, even for self -defense or to protect the person’s property, could still place school students 
or staff in jeopardy.  
 
School Boards and superintendents support th e current  law as one measure that can help keep students, 
teachers, and other school staff safe . 
 
The Secretary of State recently noted the prohibition of guns on school grounds makes her job a bit easier 
when it comes to enforcing the prohibition of guns at polling places, since many public schools are used for 
that purpose.  
 
We urge  you to keep current law in place and vote ought not to pass . The restriction in current law is a small 
inconvenience compared to the safety of the students we serve and the school staff we employ.
