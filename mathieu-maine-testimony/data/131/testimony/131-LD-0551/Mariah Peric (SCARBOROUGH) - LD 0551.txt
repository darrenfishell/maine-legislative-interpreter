LD 551
Testimony of Mariah Peric
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances.
I am deeply opposed to this bill for the following reasons:
1. Gun violence prevention measures for our schools should focus on educating kids 
and parents about the dangers of firearms and importance of secure storage.  The 
BeSmart program is a great tool to use.
2. An overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed citizens in
or near places like schools would make their jobs harder.  As someone with a long 
line of law enforcement officers in her family, I can assure you, this is the sentiment 
across the board.
Thank you.
