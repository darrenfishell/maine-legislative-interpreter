LD 551
Testimony of Miranda Gallo before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee
in OPPOSITION to LD551 - An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances. 
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Miranda Gallo and I am a resident of Yarmouth. When I heard of a shelter in 
place order due to an active shooter down the road from my house I instantly thought 
of my daughter and a need to confirm her safety. That she was safe at daycare in 
Portland, not in Yarmouth, was little comfort knowing of the multiple school 
shootings that occur in otherwise “safe” communities. That weapons of mass murder 
are legal in this country allows for this most primal fear that our children and their 
caregivers could be shot to death to have merit. 
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where
children are playing and learning. An overwhelming majority of law enforcement 
officers agree that armed citizens in or near places like schools would make their jobs 
harder.
Thank you for your time and consideration. This is not a matter of freedom – the 
freedom to own guns is not at question here, it is a matter of safety and common 
sense. 
Sincerely,
Miranda Gallo
