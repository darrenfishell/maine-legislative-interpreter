Testimony of Elizabeth Carlson before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee in OPPOSITION to LD551 - An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' 
Second Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private 
Property That is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances. 
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Elizabeth Carlson and I am a resident of South Portland. When I drove past 
exit 15 on 295 to see a car riddled with bullet holes and armed officers casing the 
woods due to an active shooter I instantly thought of my son and friends and a need to
confirm their safety. While they were safe at daycare in Portland, not in Yarmouth, 
was little comfort knowing of the multiple school shootings that occur in otherwise 
“safe” communities. That weapons of mass murder are legal in this country allows for
this most primal fear that our children and their caregivers could be shot to death to 
have merit. 
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning. An 
overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers agree that armed citizens in or 
near places like schools would make their jobs harder.
Thank you for your time and consideration. This is not a matter of freedom – the 
freedom to own guns is not at question here, it is a matter of safety and common 
sense. 
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Carlson
