LD 551
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
Name is Shawn Doil and I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to share my 
opposition to LD 551. 
Guns should never be allowed within 500 feet of school property. The majority of law
enforcement agree that guns by schools would make their jobs harder. Guns have no 
place at or by schools and as a mother of two school aged children I strongly oppose 
any effort that will make my kid's school an unsafe place. 
Thank you. Shawn
