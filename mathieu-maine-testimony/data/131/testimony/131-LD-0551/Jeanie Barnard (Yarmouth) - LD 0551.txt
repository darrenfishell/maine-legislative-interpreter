LD 551
Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Jeanie Barnard and I live in Yarmouth. I strongly object to LD 551. As a wife
of a former EMT and professional firefighter I listen carefully to the concerns of law 
enforcement personnel. Most law enforcement officers think that their job to protect 
us will be harder with armed citizens in or near places like schools. The federal and 
state laws we have now restricting guns within one thousand feet of schools have 
reduced student homicide rates. We want to keep our kids and school personnel safe 
not make their safety less likely. Thank you.
