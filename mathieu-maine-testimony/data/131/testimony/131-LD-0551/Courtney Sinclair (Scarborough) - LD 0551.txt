Testimony of Courtney Sinclair before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances,
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Courtney and I am a resident of Scarborough. 
Federal and state laws ensuring that schools are gun-free zones have helped make 
K-12 schools even safer, significantly reducing gun violence in these places.
School-associated student homicide rates decreased after the federal laws restricting 
guns within 1,000 feet of schools were adopted in the early 1990s.
When it comes to gun safety, when will we start looking to the data to drive policy? 
Aren’t we already asking enough of school aged students, making kindergarteners 
perform active shooter drills because it is necessary in today’s world? Allowing 
someone to be shooting 500 feet away, when misfires and stray bullets are possible is 
just reckless.
Thank you for your consideration.
