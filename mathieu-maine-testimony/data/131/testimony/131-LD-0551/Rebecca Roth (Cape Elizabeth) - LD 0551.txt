LD 551
My name is Rebecca Roth and I write in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to 
Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of 
Firearms on Private Property That Is Within 500 Feet of School Property in Certain 
Circumstances.
I would like to highlight two key reasons I oppose the bill. 1) Federal and state laws 
ensuring that schools are gun-free zones have helped make Kâ€“12 schools even safer, 
significantly reducing gun violence in these places. School-associated student 
homicide rates decreased after the federal laws restricting guns within 1,000 feet of 
schools were adopted in the early 1990s.  2) Gun violence prevention measures for 
our schools should focus on educating kids and parents about the dangers of firearms 
and importance of secure storage.
