Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 152, Resolve, Directing the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to 
Change the Term "Woodsman" to "Woodsperson" in the Junior Maine 
Guide Program 
Before the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 and the 
communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island. I am here before you today to 
present LD 152, Resolve, Directing the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to 
Change the Term "Woodsman" to "Woodsperson" in the Junior Maine Guide Program. 
This is a fairly straightforward resolve, and it came to me by request of a constituent. It requires 
the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to amend its rules governing the Junior Maine 
Guide Program to require that the program use the tenn "woodsperson" as a replacement for 
"Woodsman." However, after some discussion with the Department, this terminology is through 
a private entity. I would hope that group will work towards Ô¨Ånding a suitable gender-neutral 
term that is appropriate to use here. Therefore, I suggest you go into a workshop on this bill this 
afternoon and vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you for your time this afternoon. I would be happy to answer any questions you have for 
me.
