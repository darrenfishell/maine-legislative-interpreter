Testimony Neither for Nor Against LD 163 
An Act to lncrease Communication Between the Department of inland Fisheries and Wildlife and 
Lifetime License Holders by Requiring Free License Renewals Under Certain Circumstances 
February 6, 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members ofthe committee, my name is James Cote 
and l am here today on behalf of the Maine Professional Guides Association neitherfor nor against LD 
163. 
We understand that this legislation is born from the need to better understand how many lifetime 
license holders are actively intending to hunt, fish and trap each year in anticipation of future electronic 
tagging technologies and programs. The lifetime license program has been an overwhelming success, 
and we believe it has eliminated a major barrier to hunting, fishing and trapping. 
While we appreciate the Department's need to have accurate hunting, fishing and trapping license data, 
we are also concerned that this requirement could create an unfortunate barrier for lifetime license 
holders, especially youth and senior sportsmen and women. 
At a minimum, we would urge the Department and this committee to consider means of making his 
requirement as simple as possible for hunters, fishermen, and trappers. This may include exempting 
youth and seniors from this requirement, which the legislation does not appear to do, as well as phasing 
in this requirement over a period of seasons so that lifetime license holders can become accustomed to 
the process and requirements before an effective date where they could be found in violation. 
Thank you for your consideration and we would be glad to work with the committee and the 
Department in advance of the work session to alleviate these concerns. 
An organization of professional guides declicatr-ad to promoting a quality, ethical outdoor experience.
