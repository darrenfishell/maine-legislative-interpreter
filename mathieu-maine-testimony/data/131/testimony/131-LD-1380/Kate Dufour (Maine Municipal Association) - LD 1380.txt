In Support of  
LD 1380, An Act to Fund Municipal Administrative Costs Associated with the Senior Property 
Tax Stabilization Program  
 
April 12, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in support of LD 1380 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s Leg islative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest.   
Considering that the Property Tax Stabilization program, enacted by the Maine State 
Legislature in 2022,  shifts tremendous administrative burdens on to muni cipal officials, it is only 
fitting  that state  resources be used to  reimburs e municipalities for 100% of those costs, as 
proposed in LD 1380.  Failure to do so simply shifts additional property tax burdens onto 
younger homeowners and businesses owners.   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 592 -4038.
