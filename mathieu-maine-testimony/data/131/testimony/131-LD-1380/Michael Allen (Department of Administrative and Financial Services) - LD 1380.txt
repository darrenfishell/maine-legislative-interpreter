 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: 4/12/23 
  
LD 1380 – An Act to Fund Municipal Administrative Costs Associated with the 
Senior Property Tax Stabilization Program 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Against LD 1380 – An Act to Fund 
Municipal Administrative Costs Associated with the Senior Property Tax 
Stabilization Program. 
The Maine Constitution, Article IX, section 21 already requires the State to 
reimburse municipalities for 90% of the costs to administer the stabilization 
program.  The recently passed budget bill includes funding to pay those mandated 
costs.   
Considering the existing Constitutional requirement that the State reimburse 
municipalities for 90% of the costs to administer property tax exemptions, there is 
no reason to single out this program for 100% reimbursement. 
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the bill; 
representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide additional 
information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
