An Act Regar'di'* “g Calibration Requirements for Certain Testing and Measurement Equipment 
March 27, 2023 ~‘. 
Sen. Ingwersen, ?<.ep. Pluecker, and members of the Committee, my name is Celeste Poulin, and 
I am the Director of the Division of Quality Assurance and Regulation at the Department of 
Agriculture, Con; ervation and Forestry. I am writing in opposition to LD 1110, An Act 
Regarding Calib.-'-tztion Requirements for Certain Testing and Measurement Equipment. 
The Division of “Quality Assurance and Regulation (QAR) is tasked with implementing both 
state and federal law regarding commercial weighing and measuring devices. Beyond inspecting 
Weighing and measuring devices, our Consumer Protection Inspectors enforce the speciﬁcations, 
tolerances, and 0'' 
1er technical requirements for commercial weighing and measuring devices as 
adopted by the -tional Conference on Weights and Measures and published in the National 
Institute 0fSta11é :.rds and Technology (N IST) Handbook 44, “Speciﬁcations, Tolerances, and 
Other Technical' 
,?'" 
,_equirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices. ” 
Consumer Proteclion Inspectors also enforce State weights and measures regulations and Maine 
statute Title 10, Chapter 501: Weights and Measures Law. Title 10 §2402. Powers and duties 
includes 5. Exen lotions. Grant any exemptions ﬁom this chapter or any regulations promulgated 
pursuant thereto, ‘ when appropriate to the maintenance of good commercial practices within the 
State. '1' 
For the purposes of this bill, it is important to note that QAR exempts the testing of commercial 
water meters in use by municipal water utilities. That’s because those meters are already subject 
to the strict requirements dictated by the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), American 
National Standarus Institute (ANSI), and the American Water Works Association (AWWA). The 
MPUC laws 65-4;-O7, Part 6-Water Utilities, Chapter 620-Service Standards for Water Utilities § 
4 METERS, reqi, ires that meters adopt the AWWA manual M6 speciﬁcations. M6 requires that 
water meters have an error of 1.5% or less. This ﬁgure matches tolerances found in NIST 
Handbook 44 chapter 3.36. Water Meters. 
Were QAR to be "equired to inspect commercial water meters, it would have a signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial impact l 
>n the Division and require the addition of several inspectors and ofﬁce
