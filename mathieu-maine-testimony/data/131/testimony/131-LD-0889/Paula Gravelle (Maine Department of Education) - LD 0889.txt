Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 889, An Act to Better Support the Educational Attainment of Low and Moderate -income 
Communities by Providing Additional Funding to Certain School Administ rative Units , proposes 
to create the educational opportunity grant program for school administrative units ( SAUs ) in 
low and moderate -income communities.  
The Department a grees that targeting funds to low and moderate -income communities is a n 
important way to support schools and students.  In order to set up and manage a grant fund of 
this size the D epartment would require a dditional staffing.  The staff would be responsible for 
determining what qualifies as appropriate educational opportunities, creating an RFA process  
that is equitable across the state for both large and small SAUs, determining acceptable metrics 
for SAU reporting, assessing ap plicants, awarding funds, and managing the grant closeout 
process.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 889, An Act to Better 
Support the Educational Attainment of Low and Moderate -income Communities by Providing 
Additional Funding to Certain School Administrative Units  and respond to  any questions during 
the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Paula Gravelle  
Director of School Finance
