TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 889  
 
AN ACT TO BETTER SUP PORT THE EDUCATIONAL  ATTAINMENT OF 
LOW AND MODERATE -INCOME COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING ADDI-
TIONAL FUNDING TO CERTAIN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultur-
al Affairs Committee. I am Eileen King, executive director of the Maine School Su-
perintendents Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the 
Maine School Superintendents Association neither for nor against L.D. 889.  
 
Educational opportunities are those opportunities that aim to enable individuals to 
acquire knowledge and certain skills, and to cultivate certain capacities and the 
Maine School Superintendents Association believes that all students should have ac-
cess to educational opportunities.  
 
We support the concept of this bill, but we have many questions about what these 
educational opportunities will look like.   
 
• What will the educational opportunities focus on and how will they be deliv-
ered?   
• Will these educational opportunities take place during the day or will they be 
after school activities?  
• Who will be responsible for designing and implementing these educational 
opportunities?  
• Will these funds support the same educational opportunities across the state, 
or will eligible schools be able to tailor the opportunities based on their stu-
dents ’ needs?  
• What criteria will be used to measure the effectiveness of these educational 
opportunities?  
• Does the Department have the resources to carry out a 25 -million -dollar grant 
program?  
 
MSSA supports the intent of the bill, but are concerned about the cost of the grant 
program and the lack of criteria.
