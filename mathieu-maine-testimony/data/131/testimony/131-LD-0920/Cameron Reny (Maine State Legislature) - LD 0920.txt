Testimony of Senator Cameron Reny 
Introducing LD 920, “An Act to Allow Holders of Elver Fishing Licenses to Fish on 
Behalf of Other Elver Fishing License Holders” 
Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources 
April 27, 2023 
Representative Hepler and honorable colleagues of the Joint Standing Committee On Marine 
Resources, I am Senator Cameron Reny, and I represent Senate District 13, which includes most of 
Lincoln County and the towns of Washington and Windsor. Today, I am presenting LD 920, “An Act 
to Allow Holders of Elver Fishing Licenses to Fish on Behalf of Other Elver Fishing License Holders. ” 
This bill was brought to me by a constituent who has identiﬁed a speciﬁc concern with current 
requirements for elver harvesting. As an elected ofﬁcial, I believe it is important to support and give 
voice to the concerns and ideas of those I serve. 
I am presenting this bill on his behalf to give a platform for further discussion. I believe my constituent 
is present today and prepared to provide additional information, context, and address any questions you 
may have. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Cameron Reny 
State Senator, District 13 
Representing Lincoln County and the towns of Washington and Windsor
