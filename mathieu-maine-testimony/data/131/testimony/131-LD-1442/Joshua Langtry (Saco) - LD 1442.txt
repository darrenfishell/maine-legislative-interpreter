LD 1442
I am writing in support of LD 1442. As an early childhood educator I'd appreciate 
having my voice amplified in the statehouse. 
I'm hopeful for how passage of this bill could eventually lead to increasing the 
availability of benefits to early educators. So many of my colleagues don't have health
insurance or other benefits that are common for most of the workforce, this has led to 
extremely high turnover rates in the field and subsequently lower quality experiences 
for children and families. If we could get pooled health insurance affiliated with 
Maine AEYC that would be a game changer for so many of us who are already living 
from paycheck to paycheck who can't afford health insurance in the private market. 
I hope that the committee will recommend the passage of this bill.
