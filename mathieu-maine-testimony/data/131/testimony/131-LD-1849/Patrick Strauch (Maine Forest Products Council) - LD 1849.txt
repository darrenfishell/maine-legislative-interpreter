Patrick Strauch, Executive Director 
Good moming, Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the 
Committee on Agrrculture, Conservation and Forestry I’m Patrick Strauch, the 
Executive Director of the Maine Forest Products Council The Maine Forest Products 
Council 1S an organization representing more than 300 members from all facets of the 
forest products industry We also have more than 8 million acres of dues paying 
members 
I am here today to testify in opposition to LD 1849, “An Act to Ensure Fair and Timely 
Payment in the Harvesting of Forest Products ” We are testifying in opposition to this 
bill today because we feel that the current law adequately protects all parties involved 
PL 2013, c 154, §l already stipulates that, in the case of a service contract, the 
contracting party must notify the contractor of the price per ton to be paid under the 
contract pnor to the contractor providing the harvesting and/or hauling service The 
terms of payment for the service would be stipulated in the contract Under this bill, 
however, a new requirement to pay a contractor within 15 days of weighing longs (not 
delivering them) would be established 
The only place in the statute that we are able to find that references 15 days 1S with 
regards to wood scaling when weather, time of year or other circumstances prevent the 
Wood from being delivered in a tnnely manner to reflect the green wood Weight Title 
10 ss2363-A says, “When payment 1S made for seiyices harvesting wood, all weight 
measurements must be expressed on a green wood basis Except as otherwise provided 
by the state sealer, when the wood 1S not, or will not be, Weighed Withm 15 days of 
fellmg, the person performing the services may, prior to haulmg, require that the wood 
instead be measured by butt measure, or other authorized method of measurement” 
This takes into consideration that a delay in weighing wood will allow a reduction in 
weight due to diymg 
The only reference to the timing of payment in the statute refers to stumpage 
transactions in the absence of a written contract between a logger and a landowner, and 
the clock does not start running on this requirement until the harvested forest products 
are delivered Title 17 ss2512 says, “Absent a written contract that indicates different 
payment temis between the landowner and the person conducting a harvest operation, 
the person conducting the harvest operation shall provide to the landowner full payment 
for each truckload of harvested forest products transported to a handlmg or processing 
facility within 45 days of dehvery to the handlmg or processmg facility In accordance with Title 10, section 
2364A, subsection 2, paragraph G, the person conducting the harvest operation shall provide to the landowner a 
535 Civic Center Drive, Augusta ME 04330 207-622-9288 www.maineforest.org
copy of the measurement tally sheet or stumpage sheet for each truckload of forest products transported toa 
handlmg or processmg fac1l1ty when the person conductlng the harvest operatlon pays the landowner” 
To our knowledge, there are no s1gn1f1cant lssues under the current system, wh1ch1s predommantly covered 
w1th terms agreed to by both harvestlng and truckmg part1es under servlce contracts We do not see a reason to 
mvolve DACF 1n random mspectlons, and we aren’t clear what authonty th1s b1ll would glve the department to 
enforce the payment schedule That sa1d, 1f there 1s an lssue w1th the status quo, we would be happy to work 
w1th the b1ll sponsor to fmd a solut1on that makes sense for all pames lnvolved 
W1th that, I would be happy to answer any questrons that you may have
