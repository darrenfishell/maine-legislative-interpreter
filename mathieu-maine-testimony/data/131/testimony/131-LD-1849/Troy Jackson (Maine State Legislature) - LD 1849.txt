Presldent of the Senate 131st Leglslature Augusta, Ma1ne 04333 
Testimony 1n Support of LD 1849 
“An Act to Ensure Fair and Timely Payment in the Harvestmg of Forest Products" 
Ioint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservatlon, and Forestry 
May 15, 2 023 
Good mornlng Senator Ingwersen, Representat|ve Pluecker, and honorable members of the 
Jo|nt Stand|ng Comm|ttee on Agnculture, Conservatnon, and Forestry My name IS Troy Jackson 
and I have the honor of serv|ng as Senate Presldent representmg the good people of Aroostook 
County |n the Mame Leglslature I'm here today to mtroduce LD 1849, ”An Act to Ensure Falr 
and T|mely Payment |n the Harvestmg of Forest Products" 
Ensunng that loggers are treated and compensated falrly |s the reason I ﬁrst ran for OfflC6 
However, d€Spl1Z€ the laws on the books and the steps we've taken to protect falr and tlmely 
payouts, loggers and haulers are st|II not gettmg the compensatlon they deserve The b|I| before 
you slmply adds an enforcement mechan|sm to ex|st|ng state law — T|tIe 10 MRSA 2363 — to 
ensure the workers In the woods get what they are owed 
In too many cases, Ioggmg contractors fmd that the|r haul has been s|tt|ng out for months, 
dry|ng out and los|ng both wenght and value that they should be compensated for 
Unfortunately, these workers are unable to seek recourse and recenve a fa|r payment It's not 
rlght and IS affront to the laws on the books that were enacted to prevent th|s preclse sltuatlon 
Workmg |n the woods IS a demand|ng and gruelmgjob The folks domg th|s work deserve to be 
compensated fa|rIy It's clear that wlthout some degree of overslght and pressure for 
compllance, our current laws w||| s|mp|y not be as effectlve as they need to be 
The proposed leg|sIat|on w||| requnre m|n|mal resources from the Department but I belneve 
puttmg those resources towards the enforcement of laws that have already passed only makes 
sense It's about protectmg the mtegrnty of th|s |nst|tut|on and ensurmg the laws that we pass 
actually mean someth|ng to Mame people 
In Mame, we talk a lot about our herntage and the econom|c nmportance of the forest products 
Industry There |s no doubt that we should be proud of th|s herntage But we cannot forget the 
real|t\)'irar € thweriwo raéingimv tl’1€IW<1Zﬂ1’$ 4Foo1zﬁe*Iovgg|<rzg;:osvtra¢zo*rsmhmputsm-Imrgslwoursrandzdo

the d|ff|cu|t, dangerous and skrlled labor that makes up the foundatlon of th|s mdustry, It can 
feel hke a battle to slmply get pald It shouldn't and doesn't have to be th|s way 
Thus bl" presents an opportumty to support those Ioggmg contractors and gnve them conﬁdence 
that they w|ll get falr and t|me|y compensatfon for the labor they provlde and the |mportant 
product they brmg to the market I thunk that IS someth|ng we can all get behmd — fa|r and 
t|me|y payment for hard work 
Thank you for your tlme today I hope you wall _|O|ﬂ me |n supportmg th|s legrslatlon I'd be 
happy to take any questrons

tion through the Chair to the good Senator 
from Pennhscot, Senator Hayes, who may re-

l‘he Chair recognizes the Senator from Pe-

SI-2NA'l()R HAYES Mr President and Mem- 
bers of the Senate, the purpose of this amend- 
ment is to remove the discriminatory element 
of the Ilill, WI'll(.Il conﬁnes the requirements of 
the defensive driving program to those under 
twenty, and now would extend this to all new 
drivers This was discussed in Committee and it 
has the full support of the sponsor, and the 
Commission on Public Safety 
THE PRESIDENT The Chair recognizes the 
Senator from Aroostook, Senator Carpenter 
SENATOR CARPENTER Mr President and 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Senate, I also _|ust 
looked at this and I Just want to ask a question 
of somebody I believe that today when a per- 
son is issued a drivers license in the State of 
Maine, regardless of how old they are, for the 
ﬁrst year they are on probation, it is a provi- 
sional license, but that _|ust lasts for one year 
This would he that they must complete a de- fensive driinng course within two years after 
they are initially issued the provisional license 
So in actuality they would be into their second 
year, they would have their regular valid li- 
cense I wonder if this will create a problem” 
THE PRESIDENT The Chair recognizes the 
Senator from Penobscot, Senator Pray 
SENATOR PRAY I would also like to posea 
question through the Chair in reference to this 
amendment for a point of LI3l'lﬁC3.l'.l0l ‘l, so that 
the sponsor would have a chance to answer all 
of the questions I am curious as to how this 
would apply to an individual who holds a li- 
cense who has moved to this State from 
another state does that previous license count 
or would they, also, because it is now a new 
issued Maine license, have to complete this 
course no matter what their age would be‘?

Record 
SENATOR WOOD Mr President and Men 
and Women of the Senate, there has tome to 
myattention an ll'l(.ld €l'lt that I think the rest ol 
the Senate, and for that matter the whole Stat: 
should be aware of 
Last Friday was the historic day in this Legis 
lature in that it was the ﬁrst time that I have 
seen a number of people that actually work in 
the woods come down to testify on the Wood 
Measurement bill, it was not the lobbyists, it 
was not the large paper companies that have 
for too long controlled this State, but actually 
the people that go in there, fell the trees, twitch 
them out, yard them, that are here to testify on 
the Wood Measurement Bill These are the 
people that face the environmental elements 
to go into the woods and then they face the 
economic elements of not knowing exactly what 
it is that they are getting paid for They have no 
beneﬁts, they have no pension, they have no 
health insurance and they came to Augusta 
because we are their body of last resort for 
these people 
I would like to share with you a letter thatI 
received from one of the wives of the workers 
that came down “We want to express our grat 
itude to you for supporting improvements in 
the Wood Measurement Law For many years 
now the small guy, the logger, has been taken 
over the coals by the paper companies Every 
time that we spoke up for what we believe was 
right we were labeled as troublemakers, for the 
ﬁrst time at the Committee hearing Friday we 
felt that some of our problems were really 
being heard, it was encouraging 
Our livelihood depends upon a scale method 
that we understand and verify, we need strong 
penalties for companies that do not obey the 
law The only thing that we are asking is an 
honest days pay for an honest days work" 
During that hearing it came to our attention 
that one of the people, one of the workers that 
testiﬁed at a previous hearing had been visited 
by the company after he testiﬁed I have not 
been able to ascertain what the nature of that I’ Senator WOOD of York was granted Llndnl
LEGISLATIVE RECORD — SENATE, MARCH 
visit was but the implication was that it was to 
intimidate, as a. Body I ﬁnd that reprehensible 
These people are citizens like tie rest of us and 
they have the right to offer their testimony 
without fear of economic reprisals by the com- 
panies that they work for If that action is still 
going on by those companies I would urge them 
to cease and desist immediately 
It has, also come to my attention that these 
people that came down, and there were over 
twenty of them, are now going to be talked to 
individually, to show the errors of their ways, 
to show that this bill is really not workable, to 
show that this bill should be killed for their 
economic interest Again, I also find that terri- 
bly wrong So I want to let the company know 
and the people that are lobbying, and the peo- 
ple that are on their side that I,as Chairman of 
this Committee, will not allow intimidation of 
witnesses for the Committee We will act on the 
Bill, we will do what is right forthe workers, as 
well as, the company I have never been unwil- 
ling to compromise, but I and the people of this 
State will not be intimidated

should be killed for their economic interest. Again, I also find 
that terribly wrong. So I want to let the company know and the 
people that are lobbying, and the people that are on their side 
that I, as Chairman of this Committee, will not allow 
intimidation of witnesses for the Committee. We will act on the 
Bill, we will do what IS right for the workers, as well as, the 
company. I have never been unwilling to compromise, but I and 
the people of this State will not be intimidated.

TESTIMONY OF KAY EVANS 
DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF PUBLIC SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF 
AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL RESOURCES 
SUPPORTING L.D. 1768, AN ACT TO REVISE THE WOOD MEASUREMENT LAW 
SPONSORED BY SENATOR CARPENTER AND REPRESENTATIVE LOCKE 
BEFORE THE JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOOD MEASUREMENT LAW 
FRIDAY, MARcH 9, 198A 
SENATDR WDDD, REPRESENTATIVE JACQUES, AND MEMBERS OF THE 
JOINT SELEcT CDMMITTEE: 
MY NAME Is KAY EvANs. I AM DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC 
SERvIcE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FDDD AND RURAL 
REsDURcEs AND AM RESPONSIBLE FDR ADMINISTERING THE WEIGHTS AND 
MEASURES STATUTES INCLUDING THE LAws RELATING TD WOOD 
MEASUREMENT. I AM HERE TD TESTIFY IN sUPPDRT DF L.D. 1768 AN AcT 
To REVISE THE NDDD MEAsuREMENT LAW, 
THERE ARE Two FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WHICH L.D 1768 PRDPDsEs TD 
ADDREss. FIRsT OF ALL, THE BILL PRDvIDEs FOR ELIMINATION OF THE 
BUTT SCALE AS A BASIS DF PAYMENT FDR SERVICES AFTER APRIL 1, 
1985. THIS Is A PROVISION WHICH THE DEPARTMENT ENTHUsIAsTIcALLY 
ENDDRsEs. As YOU PROBABLY KNOW, DUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RESOLVING COMPLAINTS ABOUT BUTT SCALE MEASURES REDUIRE A cDsTLY 
AND COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF CHECKING VOLUME TABLES. NE WOULD 
ENCOURAGE ANY PRDPDsAL WHICH WOULD ENABLE US TD ESTABLISH 
TRACEABILITY, WHICH Is FUNDAMENTAL TD RESOLUTION DF MEASUREMENT 
_1._
MARCH 9, 198M 
ISSUES, I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN WITH THE BUTT SCALE 
PROVISIONS; AND THAT IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN BUTT SCALE IS 
USED, AS IT CAN BE WHEN PAYMENT FOR SERVICES IS NQI INVOLVED, A 
SIGNED COPY OF THE VOLUME TABLE FOR THE DESIGNATED HARVESTING 
AREA MUST BE FILED WITH THE STATE SEALER. THIS SEEMS TO US TO BE 
A RATHER BURDENSOME REQUIREMENT ON BOTH THE PARTIES INVOLVED AND 
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WE QUESTION WHETHER IT IS NOT 
SIMPLY ENOUGH TO REQUIRE THAT THE PARTIES OR THEIR AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVES AGREE IN WRITING ON A VOLUME TABLE. 
THE SECOND ISSUE WHICH L.D. 1768 ADDRESSES IS THE QUESTION 
OF QUALITY DEDUCTIONS IN PAYMENT FOR SERVICES WHEN WOOD IS CUT. 
THE BILL ELIMINATES DEDUCTIONS FOR QUALITY FACTORS ON PROPERLY 
PREPARED WOOD. THIs PROVISION Is cERTAINLY INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY 
WOOD MEASUREMENT ISSUES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE wooDcuTTER. 
IT MAY, ON THE OTHER HAND. coMPLIcATE THE coNTRAcT0R's EFFORTS To 
SET A PRICE FOR WOODCUTTING SERVICES. THIs PROPOSAL Is OFTEN 
DESCRIBED As A SIMPLE EFFORT T0 ELIMINATE MEASUREMENT DIsPuTEs. 
I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE WELL AwARE THAT THE REAL ISSUE IS MUCH 
MoRE THAN SIMPLE MEASUREMENT EFFICIENCY. THE EXTENSIVE 
DISCUSSIONS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLAcE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON 
THIS ISSUE ARE A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT THE WOOD MEASUREMENT 
SYSTEM HAS BECOME ENTANGLED WITH LABOR MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN THE 
FORESTRY INDUSTRY. WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, Fo0D AND 
RuRAL RESOURCES ARE NOT IN A POSITION T0 coMMENT ON THAT LABOR 
MANAGEMENT ISSUE. WE ARE HERE TO coMMENT ONLY ON THE TECHNICAL 
ASPECTS OF ENFORCING WHATEVER STATUTE Is ADOPTED.
