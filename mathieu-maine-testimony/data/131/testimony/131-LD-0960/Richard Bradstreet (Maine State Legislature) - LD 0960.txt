RE: LD 960 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on the Judiciary, my name is Richard Bradstreet. l represent House District 61, 
which is comprised of my home town of Vassalboro and most of Sidney. I'm here today to 
present to you LD 960, An Act Regarding the Limits on Civil Remedies Available Under the Maine 
Human Rights Act, on behalf of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce. 
This bill presents two technical clarifications of the Maine Human Rights Act that the 
Chamber believes are necessary due to recent decisions that have and will continue to harm 
employers of all sizes in Maine without action. 
The first is a clarification under Section 3, clarifying that the cap on compensatory and 
punitive damages set out in Section 1(c) cannot be waived. This seems obvious given that the 
caps are specifically delineated in the statute. All parties to these proceedings know what the 
caps are, because they are clearly stated. However, the United States District Court for the 
District of Maine is now treating damages caps as optional and waivable, which creates 
significant uncertainty for employers. This bill is an attempt to bring certainty for everyone 
going forward. 
Passing LD 960 would clarify that the damages caps are the actual caps and are not 
waivable. This would reduce needless filings seeking clarity on the caps and provide certainty 
to civil defendants. 
The second clarification that LD 960 provides is the prevention of double recovery under 
the Maine Human Rights Act. Again, the Act specifies the maximum amount of compensatory 
and punitive damages available to plaintiffs. That amount is completely up to the Legislature 
and the Legislature has set forth bands of caps starting at $50,000 for the smallest employers 
and $500,000 for the largest employers. The Judiciary, however, is now permitting litigants to 
exceed those caps by stacking damages.

The United States District Court for the District of Maine has acknowledged that 
whether a statute permits double punishment as well as the size of the caps is up to "legislative 
intent." That remains true here today. However, the Chamber believes the Legislature's intent 
of providing a higher cap than the ADA was to treat the federal law as the floor. It is my 
understanding that some states, like Texas, use the same damages as the federal law. Maine 
raised the floor, but I do not believe the Legislature meant to more than double the available 
damages. The Chamber, and I, do not think double punishment is appropriate, fair, or 
something the Legislature ever intended. This bill clarifies as such. 
I appreciate the opportunity to present this legislation. I can try and answer any 
questions you may have, but l know there is someone representing the Chamber coming 
behind me who is much better equipped to answer your specific questions on these proposed 
changes. Thank you for your time and consideration.
