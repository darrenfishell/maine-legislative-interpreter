ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO 
REDUCE THE JURY’S VERDICT  
Jon D. Levy , CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT 
JUDGE  
*1 At the October 2021 trial, the jury found that 
Defendant O’Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC (“O’Reilly 
Auto” ) had failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff 
Brian Bell as required by the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (“ADA”) and the Maine Human Rights Act 
(“MHRA”). The jury awarded Bell $42,000 in back pay 
and $75,000 in compensatory damages. The jury then 
found that O’Reilly Auto had violated both laws with 
malice or reckless indifference and awarded Bell 
$750,000 in punitive damages. O’Reilly Auto orally 
moved to reduce the jury’s verdict at the conclusion of the 
trial (ECF No. 242) and followed that with a w ritten 
motion (ECF No. 246) —which I treat as a single 
motion —citing the statutory damage caps that apply to 
compensatory and punitive awards under the ADA and 
MHRA. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981a(b)(3)  (West 2022); 5 M.R.S.A. § 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)  (West 2022).1 
 1 
 The availability of compensatory and punitive damages 
for Bell’s ADA claim and the applicable damage cap 
appear within the Civil Rights Act of 1991. See 42 
U.S.C.A. § 1981a(a)(2) , (b)(3) . This same cap 
provision also applies to certain non -ADA civil rights 
actions, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981a(a)(1) , (b)(3) , but I will 
refer to it as the ADA cap for con venience.  
 
 
Both the ADA and MHRA contain damage caps that limit 
liability as a function of how many people the defendant 
employs, and the highest cap under both laws applies to 
defendants with more than 500 employees. 42 U.S.C.A. § 
1981a(b)(3)(D) ; 5 M.R.S.A. § 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv) . 
Under the ADA’s cap, a defendant with more than 500 
employees faces up to $300,000 in compensatory and 
punitive damages. 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981a( b)(3)(D) . The 
MHRA’s cap for a defendant with more than 500 
employees is $500,000 in compensatory and punitive 
damages. 5 M.R.S.A. § 4613(2)(B)(8)(e)(iv) . O’Reilly 
Auto concedes that  the trial evidence demonstrates that it 
employed more than 500 people during all periods 
relevant to this case.  
  
 
I. WAIVER  
Bell’s primary argument is that the statutory dama ge caps 
are affirmative defenses waived by O’Reilly Auto 
because the company failed to plead them as required by 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c)  (“In responding to a 
pleading, a party m ust affirmatively state any avoidance 
or affirmative defense....”). “Affirmative defenses must be 
pled or they will generally be deemed waived and 
excluded from the case.” Jewelers Mut. Ins. v. N. Barquet, 
Inc., 410 F.3d 2, 11 (1st Cir. 2005) . O’Reilly Auto’s 
answer (ECF No. 7) did not assert the damage caps of the 
ADA or MHRA. O’ Reilly Auto contends that the two 
caps are not affirmative defenses.  
  
O’Reilly Auto’s argument that the caps are not 
affirmative defenses runs counter to long -standing First 
Circuit law. “While a statutory limitation on liability is 
not enumerated among t he listed defenses [of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) ], we think it falls within the 
Rule’s residuary clause” because the “defense shares the 
common characteristic of a bar to the righ t of recovery 
even if the general complaint were more or less admitted 
to.” Jakobsen v. Mass. Port Auth. , 520  F.2d 810, 813 (1st 
Cir. 1975)  (involving a statutory damage cap). Thus, “a 
statutory provision limiting damages to a fixed sum 
Bell v. O’Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC, Slip Copy (2022)   
 
 
 © 2023 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.  2 
 constitute[s] an affirmative defense for purposes of Rule 
8(c).” Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp. , 15 
F.3d 1222, 1226 (1st Cir. 1994) . That principle was 
reaffirmed last year, when the First Circuit concluded that 
a statutory damage cap “is a statutory limitation on 
liability, and ... the defendant ... has waived the defense 
by failing to include it in a responsive pleading.” 
Carrasquillo -Serrano v. Municipality of Canovanas , 991 
F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 2021) . Thus, I join the District of 
Puerto Rico in concluding that the First Circuit has 
“unequivocally ” characterized statutory limitations on 
liability —including damage caps —as affirmative 
defenses. Camacho v. San Juan Bautista Med. Ctr., Inc. , 
Civil No. 10 –1857, 2013 WL 653946, at *3 (D.P.R. Feb. 
21, 2013)  (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the ADA’s 
and MHRA’s damage  caps are properly treated as 
affirmative defenses.  
  
*2 O’Reilly Auto also contends that because the First 
Circuit has not addressed the specific damage caps at 
issue here, I should instead follow a decision from the 
Distri ct of Connecticut that held the ADA’s cap is not an 
affirmative defense. See Oliver v. Cole Gift Centers, Inc., 
85 F. Supp. 2d 109, 111 -12 (D. Conn. 2000) .2 In arriving 
at that conclusion, Oliver  distinguished the First Circuit’s 
decisions in Jakobsen  and Knapp Shoes  as focused on the 
potential for unfair surprise, a concern that is not 
applicable when “caps [are] evident on the face of the 
statutory schemes under which the plaintiffs had brought 
their claims.” Id. at 111 . The district court reasoned that 
“[n]o plaintiff ... can complain of unfair surprise, 
prejudice, or lack of opportunity to respond when 
confronted with the ... limitation of damages [under 42 
U.S.C.A. § 1981a(b)(3) ], because the limitation is part of 
the same statutory scheme under which the plaintiff has 
brought his or her claim.” Id. at 112 . 
 2 
 Oliver  addressed the statutory cap from 42 U.S.C.A. § 
1981a(b)(3)  in the context of a Title VII claim. See 
Oliver , 85 F. Supp. 2d at 110 -11; see supra  note 1.  
 
 
I part company with Oliver ’s characterization of Knapp 
Shoes . In Knapp Shoes , the plaintiff’s claims for damages 
arose in part under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, section 
2-715 (1994) and were possibly barred by Mass. Gen. 
Laws ch. 106, section 2 -719 (1994). Knapp Shoes , 15 
F.3d at 1226 . Both provisions are part of Massachusetts’s 
enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, so the 
availability of damages and the potential limitation were 
part of the same statutory scheme. Moreover, the First 
Circuit has never analyzed the obviousness of a statutory 
limitation on liability to decide whether a defense is 
affirmative or ordinary. See Jakobsen , 520 F.2d at 813 ; 
Knapp Shoes , 15 F.3d at 1226 ; Carrasquillo -Serrano , 991 F.3d at 42 -43. Instead, “[t]he First Circuit test for whether 
a given defense” is affirmative “is whether the defense 
‘shares the common characteristic of a bar to the right of 
recovery even if the general complaint were more or less 
admitted to.’ ” Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. , 71 
F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 1995)  (quoting Jakobsen , 520 F.2d 
at 813 ); see Knapp Shoes , 15 F.3d at 1226  (classifying a 
statutory limitation on liability as an affirmative defense 
because it “performs the same damage limitation 
function” as a damage cap). Thus, I do not adopt Oliver ’s 
reasoning or conclusion.  
  
O’Reilly Auto’s next argument is that the defendants in 
Knapp Shoes  and Carrasquillo -Serrano  waived the 
statutory limitations on damages only because the 
untimely assertion of those defenses would have denied 
the plaintiffs an opportunity to develop relevant evidence 
and counterarguments. O’ Reilly Auto asserts that a 
different result is appropriate here because Bell would not 
have benefitted from earlier notice of the company’s 
intent to invoke the damage caps. O’Reilly Auto reasons 
that, if the caps are not waived, there is no argument that 
they do not apply here, and, because O’Reilly Auto 
clearly employs more than 500 people, the company 
belongs in the highest tier within each cap and Bell could 
not have introduced evidence to establish the applicability 
of a higher cap. O’Reilly Auto also asserts that Bell was 
on notice of the caps because they are an intrinsic part of 
the statutory schemes under which he brought his claims.  
  
I treat O’Reilly Auto as arguing in the alternative that (1) 
considerations of prejudice and notice bear on whether  the 
caps should be classified as affirmative defenses and, 
separately, (2) O’Reilly Auto’s failure to plead the caps 
should be excused for those same reasons if the caps are 
affirmative defenses. The first argument is not persuasive 
because, as already me ntioned in my discussion of Oliver , 
the First Circuit test for affirmative defenses is not 
prejudice or notice but whether the defense would bar 
recovery even if the defendant conceded the accuracy of 
the complaint. And the First Circuit has thrice held th at 
statutory limitations on damages satisfy that standard. 
Jakobsen , 520 F.2d at 813 ; Knapp Shoes,  15 F.3d at 1226 ; 
Carrasquillo -Serrano , 991 F.3d at 43 . 
  
*3 O’Reilly Auto also argues that if the statutory caps are 
affirmative defenses, its failure to plead them should be 
excused due to  notice and lack of prejudice. This 
argument finds support in Jakobsen , in which the First 
Circuit observed that “[t]he ordinary consequence of 
failing to plead an affirmative defense is its forced waiver 
and its exclusion from the case” but, “when there i s no 
prejudice and when fairness dictates, the strictures of this 
rule may be relaxed.” 520 F.2d at 813 . In that case, 
Bell v. O’Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC, Slip Copy (2022)

 however, the court concluded that it would have been 
unfair to “treat[ ] the untimely [damage -cap] defense as a 
late amendment that should have been allowed” for 
multiple reasons, including that “[t]he delay undercut 
plaintiff’s ability to develop facts and fashion his case in a 
manner relevant to this defense.” Id. at 813 -14, 816 . In 
Knapp Sho es, the court characterized Jakobsen  as 
“referring favorably to the no -prejudice test” without 
adopting it. Knapp Shoes , 15 F.3d at 1226 . Knapp Shoes  
similarly did “not decide whether notice and no prejudice 
would ... serve as an excuse [for the late assertion of an 
affirmative defense] in this circuit.” Id. The court did 
explain, however, that “[t]he reas on why affirmative 
defenses under Rule 8(c)  must be pled in the answer is to 
give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance 
to develop evidence and offer arguments to controvert t he 
defense.” Id. 
  
In the years since Knapp Shoes , the First Circuit has more 
clearly “identified exceptions to Rule 8(c) ’s bar of 
untimely affirmative defenses, including when: (1) ‘the 
defendant asserts it without undue delay and the plaintiff 
is not unfairly prejudiced by any delay,’ or (2) ‘the 
circumstances  necessary to establish entitlement to the 
affirmative defense did not obtain at the time the answer 
was filed.’ ” O’Brien v. Town of Bellingham , 943 F.3d 
514, 528 (1st Cir. 2019)  (quoting Davignon v. Clemmey , 
322 F.3d 1 , 15 (1st Cir. 2003) ); accord  Shervin v. 
Partners Healthcare Sys., Inc. , 804 F.3d 23, 52 (1st Cir. 
2015)  (“A district court may relax the raise -or-waive rule 
when equity so dictates and there is no unfair prejudice to 
any opposing party.”). “Those cases which permit the 
interposition of an affirmative defense outside the 
pleadings generally have involved moderat e delays, such 
as an attempt to raise the defense in a pretrial motion to 
dismiss or for summary judgment, rather than at trial or in 
a postjudgment motion.” Davignon , 322 F.3d at 16 . And 
“postponements become far less tolerable where a 
defendant ... has tendered no justification whatsoever for 
the belated request.” Id. 
  
Here, it would be inequitable to allow O’ Reilly Auto to 
assert the statutory damage caps this late in the life of this 
unusually long civil proceeding. Although it was not 
known whether the jury would award damages in excess 
of the caps until the verdicts were announced, the 
statutory caps have a pplied to this case since its inception. 
As such, the circumstances necessary to establish 
entitlement to the affirmative defenses existed when 
O’Reilly Auto filed its answer five years ago. O’Reilly 
Auto’s argument that its failure to plead affirmative 
defenses should be excused is being made after the 
second trial of this case to a jury. Further, O’Reilly Auto 
has not argued that it did anything to put Bell on actual notice of its intent to invoke the caps, only that the caps 
are obvious. Finally, as to p rejudice, a litigant in Bell’s 
shoes would have been justified in thinking that the caps 
had been waived and may have made strategic litigation 
decisions in reliance on that assumption. See 
Hernández -Miranda v. Empresas Díaz Massó, Inc. , 651 
F.3d 167, 173 (1st Cir. 2011)  (reasoning that advance 
knowledge of which of the graduated caps within 42 
U.S.C.A. § 1981a(b)(3)  applies “allows for both sides to 
set realistic litigation budgets and evaluate whether cases 
are worth bringing and defending” and “ allow[s] litigants 
to make informed decisions about settlement”).3 
 3 
 O’Reilly Auto also argues that Hernández -Miranda , 
651 F.3d 167 , and Burnett v. Ocean Properties, Ltd. , 
422 F.Supp.3d 400 (D. Me. 2019) , support the 
conclusion that the ADA’s and MHRA’s caps cannot 
be waived. These citations are inapposite because they  
did not examine whether defendants had waived the 
caps by failing to plead them. In Hernández -Miranda , 
the First Circuit selected the appropriate damage cap 
under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981a(b)(3)  in light of the best 
available evidence of how many people the defendant 
employed. 651 F.3d at 170, 176 & n.7 . In Burnett , the 
court imposed the highest available caps under the 
ADA and MHRA because the defendant had failed to 
put on evidence that it had fewer than 500 employees. 
422 F.Supp.3d at 427 . In other words, these cases 
address how courts should select among the tiers within 
the ADA’s and MHRA’s caps wh en the caps have not 
been waived.  
 
 
*4 For the foregoing reasons, O’Reilly Auto forf eited the 
statutory damage caps under the ADA and MHRA by 
failing to plead the same as affirmative defenses. 
Accordingly, I do not address O’Reilly Auto’s argument 
that the jury’s award of compensatory and punitive 
damages should be reduced to $500,000 to avoid a double 
punishment.  
  
 
II. CONCLUSION  
Defendant O’Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC’s Motion to 
Reduce the Jury’s Verdict (ECF Nos. 242, 246) is 
DENIED . 
  
SO ORDERED.
