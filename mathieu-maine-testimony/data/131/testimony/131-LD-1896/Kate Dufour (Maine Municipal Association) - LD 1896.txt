In Opposition to  
LD 1896 , An Act to Index Workers’ Compensation Benefits to the Rate of Inflation  
 
May 11, 2023  
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 1896  
on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’ s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Municipal officials are concerned that the changes proposed in LD 1896 will significantly 
increase the cost of benefits provided under the Workers’ Compens ation Act, thereby shifting 
additional burdens onto the property taxpayers who simply cannot afford it.  Additionally, the 
bill advances a policy that is inconsistent with the consensus that was built around a 2019 
amendment to the Act that provides for a cost-of-living adjustment after an employee has 
received 260 weeks of total benefits.  From the perspective of municipal leaders, it is best to let 
the current  policy be more fully implemented before seeking additional amendments and 
refinements  to the law.  
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about the Association’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at
