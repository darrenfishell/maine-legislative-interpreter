Testimony of Senator Timothy Nangle introducing 
LD 1896, "An Act to Index Workers‘ Compensation Benefits to the Rate of 
Inﬂation" 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
May 11, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing, I am Senator Tim Nangle. I represent Senate District 26, which includes the 
communities of Windham, Raymond, Casco, Frye Island, and part of Westbrook. Today, I am here to 
introduce LD 1896, "An Act to Index Workers’ Compensation Beneﬁts to the Rate of Inﬂation." 
Inﬂation is a natural phenomenon that affects all aspects of our economy, including the cost of living for 
workers. As the prices of goods and services increase over time, the purchasing power of workers’ 
compensation beneﬁts decreases. This silent shrinkage places an undue burden on injured workers, who 
are often struggling to cope with everyday expenses as their earning capacity is compromised. 
LD 1896 proposes a simple yet powerful solution: index workers’ compensation beneﬁts to the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure compiled by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. This ensures that the real value of these beneﬁts stays constant, providing much-needed 
stability for our workers when they are most vulnerable. 
The beneﬁts of this approach are numerous. For workers, it means that an injury won't lead to a long- 
term economic setback, in addition to physical pain and suffering. It provides them with the conﬁdence 
that their beneﬁts will maintain pace with the cost of living, a basic right in a just society. 
For employers, the beneﬁts are subtle but equally signiﬁcant. By maintaining the purchasing power of 
workers‘ compensation beneﬁts, we reduce the ﬁnancial stress on our workforce. This can lead to 
increased productivity, higher job retention, and potentially lower insurance premiums and 
administrative costs. 
For disabled Mainers, particularly those unable to return to work, the importance of LD 1896 cannot be 
overstated. Where workers‘ compensation often serves as their primary or sole source of income, the 
purchasing power of their beneﬁts becomes a lifeline. When inﬂation erodes the value of these beneﬁts, 
it can make the difference between meeting basic needs and facing ﬁnancial hardship. 
This bill seeks to safeguard their ability to afford necessities and maintain a digniﬁed standard of living. 
It's a critical support for our fellow Mainers navigating life with Work-related disabilities, providing them 
with much-needed ﬁnancial stability in a world that often presents extra challenges for them. This bill is 
more than just an adjustment for inﬂation — it's a testament to our commitment to the well-being of all 
Mainers, particularly those living with work-related disabilities.

By creating a more secure and stable workforce, we are making an investment in the future of Maine 
and its citizens. We're supporting the resilience of our communities and boosting our local economy, 
creating a Win-win situation for all. 
In conclusion, LD 1896 is an investment in the people of Maine. It ensures that the ﬁnancial security 
promised by Workers’ compensation isn't eroded by the invisible hand of inﬂation. It recognizes the 
dignity and value of our Workers, while also acknowledging the pivotal role of businesses in our state's 
economy. 
I urge you to support this bill, to ensure that the Maine Workers’ Compensation Act of 1992 remains a 
relevant and effective tool for supporting our workforce in the face of changing economic realities. 
Thank you for your attention and consideration. I’m happy to answer any questions. 
Sincerely, 
“ll:/~ Umgk
