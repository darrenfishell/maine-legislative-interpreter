LD 1238
To the Esteemed Members of the Health and Human Services Comimitte: 
My name is Dixie Redmond. I live in Hampden, Maine.  I'm the mother of a grown 
son who is autistic and has a developmental disability. 
I urge you to vote YES on LD1238, which would require OADS to collect quarterly 
data on waiver participants and to what extent they are able to find services for which 
they are eligible. 
Why is this important?  Because someone can be "off the waitlist" but still be waiting 
for meaningful supports. For ten years my son has received less than half of the 
services he was eligible for. For many, many months of that time it was 5 hours a 
week out of the 32 hours he was eligible for. This impacted him and our family in 
profound ways, causing him to lose skills, and impacting his mental health greatly. 
My son needs 24-7 eyes on support. 
OADS is to be applauded for collecting anecdotal information in listening sessions in 
the last 4 years. Collecting quarterly data would more specifically shine a light on 
which waiver participants have the hardest time in finding services. It could also 
provide helpful information as OADS develops its new Lifespan Waiver. 
LD1238 would make the needs of disabled people more visible. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Dixie Redmond
Hampden, ME
