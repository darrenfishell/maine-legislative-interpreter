Tuesday, April 11, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and 
distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
I am State Representative David Woodsome, and I proudly 
represent District 139, Limerick, Parsonsfield, and a portion of 
Waterboro. It is an honor to appear before you today for the 
purpose of introducing L.D. 1262, “An Act to Amend the Law 
Governing the Credit Card and Debit Card Surcharge Prohibition. ” 
Under current law, a seller in a sales transaction may not 
impose a surcharge on a cardholder who uses a credit card or 
debit card in lieu of payment by cash, checks, or similar means. 
L.D. 1262 seeks to authorize a seller in a sales transaction to 
impose a surcharge as long as the seller is registered asa 
seller with the State for sales tax purposes and the seller uses 
an authorized Bﬁhparty payment service provider. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
