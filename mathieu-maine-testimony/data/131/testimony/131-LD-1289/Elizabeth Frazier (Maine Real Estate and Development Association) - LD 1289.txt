MEREDA LD 1289, An Act to Facilitate Property Redevelopment and Encourage Affordable Housing by 
Allowing the Conveyance of Unfinished Commercial Condominium Units 
Testimony in Support 
May 9, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Honorable Members ofthe Joint Select Committee on 
Housing, 
My name is Elizabeth Frazier and lam submitting this testimony in support of LD 1289, An Act to 
Facilitate Property Redevelopment and Encourage Affordable Housing by Allowing the Conveyance of 
Unfinished Commercial Condominium Units. 
MEREDA is a statewide, membership-based organization founded in 1985, whose members include real 
estate owners, for—profit and non—profit developers, bankers, property managers and other related 
professionals who are committed to supporting responsible development and real estate ownership 
throughout Maine. Through the work of its Public Policy Committee, MEREDA pursues a more fair, 
predictable, and practical policy environment. 
MEREDA supports LD 1289 because we believe it represents a common-sense amendment to modernize 
the Maine Condominium Act to allow for innovative use of spaces, including rehabilitated mills. LD 1289 
would change the Maine Condominium Act to allow for the conveyance of an unfinished condominium 
(condo). The purpose of this change is to allow a developer to rehabilitate a space, like an old mill 
building, divide it into condominium units, and then transfer those units to another developer who will 
fit out the space for the end-use. Let's explore this example further. 
Let's say a mill building in downtown Auburn needs rehabilitation. Given the size of the mill (roughly 
equivalent to two squared city blocks), it is necessary to find multiple uses for the space. The 
rehabilitating developer sets out to do the work of securing the building, adding new insulation, 
windows, roofing, etc., 
Meanwhile, given the current need for affordable housing, an affordable housing developer is interested 
in developing 100 affordable units in one wing ofthe rehabilitated mill building. Likewise, a local 
weaving company would like to set up a loom and spinning operation, and a brewery and group of small 
retailers would like to develop a premiere dining and retail space on the first floor. To accommodate all 
these uses and users, the original rehabilitator ofthe mill will carve up the mill into condo units. Those 
condo units can then be finished into the space necessary for the end-use. The affordable housing 
developer can now purchase one of condo units and build out the project. 
Under current law, it is challenging to complete the scenario mentioned above, because the current law 
disallows the transfer of an unfinished commercial condo unit. The use and function of the condo asa
disposition of real property has changed over the years, and we believe the time is right to modernize 
the law to allow the kind of example herein described to proceed expediently. 
MEREDA's proposed changes to the law will ensure that there are ample protections for the end user- 
including if that end user will be living in a dwelling unit. It modernizes the law to allow for transactions 
between sophisticated parties, and it contains guardrails to protect the end-user's interest. Specifically, 
upon conveyance of the property, both the seller-developer and the transferee-developer must enter 
into a written agreement to assign the responsibilities for completion of the condo unit — including if 
one condo unit will ultimately contain multiple dwelling units, such as in an affordable housing project. 
This fix is particularly important to affordable housing projects because they cannot take on other types 
of development and still qualify for state and federal incentives like the low-income housing tax credit. 
The affordable housing developer needs to be able to fit out just the affordable housing units and not 
take on responsibility for owning and fitting out any other uses like retail or dining. 
The proposed amendment to Maine's Condominium Act has been vetted by the MEREDA Public Policy 
Committee, including by two lawyers who practice affordable housing real estate law and two lawyers 
who practice title law. They have spent considerable time and effort to effectuate the intent of this 
proposal while ensuring protections for the ultimate end-user. 
We hope the Housing Committee will see the opportunities apparent in LD 1289 to fix some low-hanging 
fruit while expediting affordable housing projects and simplifying the rehabilitation process for some of 
Maine's most challenging properties — like the remaining rundown mills. We look forward to working 
with the committee to amend the bill as necessary and hope that we can adopt this commonsense 
approach to updating Maine's Condominium Act. 
Please vote Ought to Pass on LD 1289. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
Elizabeth M. Frazier
