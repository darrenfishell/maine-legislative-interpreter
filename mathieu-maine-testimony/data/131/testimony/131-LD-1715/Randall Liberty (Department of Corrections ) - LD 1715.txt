TESTIMONY OF  
 
RANDALL A. LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER  
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  
 
NFNA  
 
LD 1715 An Act to Replace Certain Stigmatizing Language in the Maine Revised Statutes, Titles 
22, 25 and 34 -A with Respectful Language  
 
Before the  
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee  
May 2, 2023  
 
 
Senator Beebe -Center and Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony neither for nor against LD 1715 . 
 
While the MDOC does not take a position on the bill we commend Representative Milliken for this bill. Her 
commitment to normalizing language and reducing stigma is admirable and will make a difference  
 
There are a few minor changes  that should be ma de for clarity purposes, but  nothing that changes the intent or 
substance of the work Representative Millikin has put in thus far.  
 
Our team has been in touch with the sponsor and will work with her prior to language review to go over the 
changes.  
 
Thank  You,  
 
Randall A. Liberty, Commissioner  
Maine Department of  Corrections
