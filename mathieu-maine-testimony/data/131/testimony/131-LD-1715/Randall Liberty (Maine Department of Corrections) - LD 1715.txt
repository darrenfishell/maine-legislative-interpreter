TESTIMONY OF 
RANDALL A. LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER 
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS 
NFNA N 
LD 1715 An Act to Replace Certain Stigmatizing Language in the Maine Revised Statutes, Titles 
22, 25 and 34-A with Respectful Language 
Before the 
Criminal Justice Public Safety Committee 
May 2, 2023 
Senator Beebe-Center and Representative Salisbury and other distinguished members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee, I am Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections 
providing testimony neither for nor against LD 1715. 
While the MDOC does not take a position on the bill we commend Representative Milliken for this bill. Her 
commitment to normalizing language and reducing stigma is admirable and will make a difference 
There are a few minor changes that should be made for clarity purposes, but nothing that changes the intent or 
substance of the work Representative Millikin has put in thus far. 
Our team has been in touch with the sponsor and will work with her prior to language review to go over the 
changes. 
Thank You, 
Randall A. Liberty, Connnissioner 
Maine Department of Corrections
