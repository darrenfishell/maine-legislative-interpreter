Re: Opposition to LD 383 , An Act to Restore Legislative Oversight of Rulemaking  
 
 
Senator Nangle , Representative Stover,  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government , I am writing regarding  LD 383,  An Act to Restore Legislative Oversight of Rulemaking . 
This bill would require all departmental rules to be major substantive rules. This would have a 
detrimental impact on the ability of the Department of Labor to deliver se rvices to the people of Maine 
and to comply with federal laws.  
 
The process for enacting or amending major substantive rules is outlined in Maine’s Administrative 
Procedures Act, Title 5 §8072.  
 
The Department of Labor rules encompass 72 chapters across ten agencies. Rules cover apprenticeship, 
vocational rehabilitation , safety and health, labor relations, and unemployment, among others. Of these 
rules, 70 are routine technical rules. Routine technical rules  allow agencies to set procedur al 
requirements, clarify  policies and  are authorized in legislation. In some cases, the ability to modify rules 
is required to remain in compliance with federal regulations.  
 
For example, the Maine Department of Labor’s has issued rules regarding post -employment services for 
people with disabilities.  These  rules define what types of services the department will continue to 
provide once an individual becomes employed, and for how long after  their employment begins. 
Recent ly, the federal Rehabilitation Services Agency issued an updated interpretation of the federal 
guidelines , changing the process we must use to continue to support these individuals. If a major 
substantive rule change was required, we would face the next 12 -18 months of either being out of 
compliance with federal regulations or having additional barriers and delays for support ing people with 
disabilities.  
 
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 383.
