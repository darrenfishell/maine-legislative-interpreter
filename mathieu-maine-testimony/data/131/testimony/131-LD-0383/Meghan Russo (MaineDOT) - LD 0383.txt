Testimony of Meghan Russo  
Maine Department of Transportation  
Before the 1 31st Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on State and Local 
Government  
 
In Opposition  
 
LD 383 
An Act to Restore Legislative Oversight of Rulemaking  
________________________________________________________________________  
 
Senator Nangle , Representative Stover , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State 
and Local Government , my name is  Meghan Russo , and I am the Legislative Liaison for the 
Maine Department of Transportation . MaineDOT  respectfully submits this testimony in 
opposition to LD 383, An Act to Restore Legislative Oversight of Rulemaking.   
 
Passage of the LD 383 would impose a significant burden on MaineDOT .  Requiring that all 
proposed rules go through the more lengthy and laborious process of major substantive 
rulemaking  would necessitate  the addition of at least a parttime, perhaps a fulltime paralegal 
position to our legal office staf f.  This requirement would also delay the mos t routine rulemaking 
and impede MaineDOT’s ability to implement the legislative intent of laws developed and 
enacted by the legislature.  
 
Checks and balances within the current rulemaking process already exist between the legislative 
and executive branches .  The legislature has the authority to determine which rules require 
additional oversight, major substantive, and which rules were routine in nature and need not be 
delayed, routine technical.  In addition,  every year MaineDOT, along with other state agen cies, is 
required to provide the legislature a copy of our regulatory agenda which must include a list of 
rules that we expect to propose .  This agenda is filed with the Secretary of State’s Office and 
submitted to our legislative committee of jurisdiction . 
 
The requirements set forth in LD 383 would slow routine rulemaking, require additional state 
resources, and  greatly expand the workload of all legislative committees .  It is for these reasons 
we request that you vote in opposition to LD 383.  Thank you.
