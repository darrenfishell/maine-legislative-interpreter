LD 383
We apologize for missing the hearing date. Please consider our written testimony in 
opposition to LD 383. Friends of Casco Bay is an organization dedicated to 
improving and protecting the health of the Casco Bay watershed. We monitor water 
quality and share our data with the State. We actively participate in both routine 
technical and major substantive rule-making. Both allow adequate public 
participation. The designation of certain rules as routine technical allows experts, with
input from stakeholders, to nimbly adjust rules to best protect Maine's environment.  
The legislature already sets which rules are routine technical and which are major 
substantive. You have the power to adjust these designations where warranted. We 
respectfully ask that this Committee vote that LD 383 ought not to pass.
