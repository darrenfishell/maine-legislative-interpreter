Re: L.D. 383 - An Act to Restore Legislative Oversight of Rulemaking
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government:
I am writing on behalf of the Sex Offender Management and Risk Assessment Advisory Commission 
in opposition to LD  383.  The bill seeks to make all rules major substantive rules and eliminate routing 
technical rules.
Since 1977 Maine agencies and other entities have been delegated authority to make rules to effectively 
implement the will of the Legislature.  In many cases these rules are essential to effectuate what the 
legislature has enacted by statute.  The rules are often highly detailed, technical and complex in nature.  
Because of the often technical nature and sheer volume of rules that are necessary, this task needs to be 
delegated to those who are most familiar with the subject matter.  Rules often deal with details and 
nuances most familiar by subject matter experts, namely the agencies that effectuate the rules.  Rules 
are utilized by most agencies, some on a daily basis and should be overseen by those very agencies.
Convicted sex offenders come under the purview of rules promulgated by the Sex Offender Registry, 
the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Corrections and the Department of Health and 
Human Services.  The agencies that supervise and oversee sex offenders should have the flexibility to 
make changes to rules that they utilize to keep the public safe from convicted sex offenders.
