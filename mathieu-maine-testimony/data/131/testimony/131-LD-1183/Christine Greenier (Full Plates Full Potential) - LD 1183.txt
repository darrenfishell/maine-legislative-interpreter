Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan abd esteemed members of the joint 
Standing Committee on ducation and Cultural Affairs. My name is Christine 
Greenier. I am a retired School Nutrition Director from RSU 22 and currently a 
consultant with Full Plates Full Potential.
Today I am submitting testimony in support of LD 1183 “An Act to Establish the 
School Meal Equipment and Program Improvement Fund”
When I was the School Nutrition Director in RSU 22 it was a worry and a struggle to 
maintain or replace kitchen equipment in our 7 schools. Hiring contracted services to 
repair equipment was very costly and not something that could be ignored or delayed. 
Often parts and labor was not available for equipment that was just too old! School 
Nutrition Programs should not be made to use equipment that is faulty and potentially
dangerous. When the only choice was to replace a necessary piece of equipment the 
cost was insurmountable. Many school districts like mine do not receive any, or 
minimal appropriation from the district budget. To me, this makes no sense! Feeding 
children is not an optional benefit. It is critical to the success of the child and the 
school system to ensure Maine kids’ nutritional needs are met. This means that the 
classroom known as the cafeteria is well equipped to meet this goal. 
Please support this bill to ensure that all schools in Maine are equipped to meet the 
needs of our children. It is not just important, it is critical. Thank you for your time 
and commitment to Maine’s children.
