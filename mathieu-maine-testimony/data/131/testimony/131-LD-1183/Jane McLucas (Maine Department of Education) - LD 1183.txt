Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 1183 , An Act to Establish the School Meal Equipment and Program Improvement Fund  
establishes the School Meal Equipment and Program Improvement Fund in the Department of 
Education to issue grants to eligible school administrative units  (SAUs)  to purchase school 
kitchen and cafeteria equipment needed to serve healthy meals, to improve food safety in school 
kitchens and cafeterias, to support the maintenance and expansion of the National School Lunch 
Program and School  Breakfast Program and to reimburse food costs , above the current 
reimbursement rate,  related to medically necessary dietary restrictions of students. It also 
requires the Department to apply for federal grants available to support these purposes  
Schools a cross the state need  updated equipment to support the serving of healthy  and nutriti ous 
meals to Maine students. In order to address this ongoing and very real need, t hrough an 
allotment of federal funds, t he Maine Department of Education (Maine DOE) Child  Nutrition 
team  has annually  provide d an opportunity for SAUs to apply for an equipment grant  since 2013 . 
Over the past three (3) years thi s has  equate d to $357,812.00 r eceived by a total of 39 SAUs for  
equipment such as dishwashers, coolers, freezers, steamers, ovens, serving counters, slicers, 
ranges, food processors, milk coolers, mobile serving units, warming cabinets.  These funds were 
distributed with a priority given to schools with a benefit level over 50% Free and  Reduced Meal 
Benefit  Level.  Apart from the current  school year, we received more applications than funds to 
be distributed , this year we were able to award to all applicants.  
Special Dietary Accommodations are a way for school  nutrition departments  to be able to meet 
the needs of students who have medical needs associated with food or food intake.  Procedures 
require that guardians submit a doctor's  note with appropriate substitutions for the student .  
When the school nutrition department  is meeting  the requirements of the doctor's  instructions,  
they may be reimbursed at the current reimbursement rate for the meal,  even if it does not meet 
the meal pattern guidelines for the program.   This bill would address additional costs, if  any for 
the accommodation to be met.

The Maine DOE does not collect data related to  related to special dietary accommodations.   In 
order for this section of the bill to be implemented , SAU’s would need to submit documentation 
of the student, current doctor ’s note, and receipts  for additional rei mbursement from the fund.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1183  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
