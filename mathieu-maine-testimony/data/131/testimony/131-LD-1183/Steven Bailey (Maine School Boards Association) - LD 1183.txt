 TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 1183  
 
AN ACT TO ESTABLISH THE SCHOOL MEAL EQUIPMENT  
AND PROGRAM IMPROVEM ENT FUND  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cul-
tural Affairs Committee. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine 
School Boards Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the 
Maine School Boards Association, in support of L.D. 1183.  
 
School boards support this bill because it supports our efforts to feed our students.  
It does this by creating a fund under the auspices of the Department of Education 
to provide grants to purchase school equipment, improve food safety, and expand 
the school lunch and breakfast programs. It also recognizes that some of our stu-
dents have dietary restrictions and we need to be able to prepare meals that meet 
those restrictions.  
 
The value of schools feeding kids was highlighted during the pandemic, when 
there was no school. Where possible, cafeterias were staffed to make sure food 
was prepared and distributed to families who relied on school meals to help keep 
their children fed.  
 
Not all or even most food programs break even so subsidy is essential. We support 
the department going after federal grants for food service programs to support the 
essential role schools play in keeping students fed so they can learn.
