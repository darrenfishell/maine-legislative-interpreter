L.D. 1381 
Senator Grohaski and Representative Perry and members of the 
Taxation Committee. I'm David Kent from Standish. l'm a member of 
Maine Farm Bureau and President of Cumberland County Farm Bureau. 
I'm testifying today in support of L.D. L.D. 1381. 
The present system of calculating the excise tax was put into effect in 
1969 or 54 years ago. Back then, vehicles were sold at or close to the 
MSRP. Before the pandemic, dealers were routinely advertising vehicles 
15 to 35% below the MSRP. Under the current method, that meant 
your constituents were constantly paying an excise tax on money that 
they never spent. During the pandemic that changed to closer to the 
MSRP. Now, post pandemic dealers are beginning to advertise new 
vehicles below the MSRP. L.D. 1381 corrects the flaw and bases the 
excise tax on the bill of sale or state sales tax document to verify the 
sales price. Thus, your constituents are no longer paying an excise tax 
on money that they did not spend. This bill also makes the 
municipalities whole by requiring the State to reimburse them for any 
loss of revenue in comparing the new method to the old method. 
You may hear testimony that the proposed change is not fair to those 
who are not good negotiators. Well life isn't always fair. You will also 
hear testimony about the cheaters. Unfortunately, we do have cheaters 
in our society. The proposed changes are acceptable to the State in 
collecting the sales tax, so why aren't they acceptable to the 
municipalities? We strongly support an out to pass on L.D. 1381. 
Thank you. Any questions?
