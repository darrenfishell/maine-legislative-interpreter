Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1381,
“An
Act
to
Create
Fairness
in
Maine's
Motor
Vehicle
Excise
Tax
by
Basing
the
Tax
on
the
Sale
Price”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
policy
analyst
for
Maine
Policy
Institute,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1381.
Maine’s
red
tape
and
regulations
surrounding
automobiles
are
tremendously
expensive
and
represent
yet
another
cost
that
everyday
Mainers
must
overcome.
These
policies
make
it
harder
for
low-income
earners
to
purchase
and
maintain
a
vehicle,
which
is
a
critical
tool
for
gainful
employment
in
a
rural
state.
Many
states
have
lower
car
taxes,
and
some—like
our
neighbor
New
Hampshire—don’t
have
any
automobile
sales
taxes
at
all.
A
U.S.
News
analysis
of
government
and
private
sector
data
revealed
that
the
average
annual
cost
to
own
a
car
in
Maine—when
insurance,
repairs,
taxes,
fees,
and
gasoline
expenses
were
calculated—is
more
than
$5,400.
1
Mainers
spend
more
than
the
national
average,
and
it’s
more
expensive
here
than
in
New
Hampshire
or
Vermont.
The
average
car
owner
in
Maine
pays
nearly
$900
in
taxes
and
fees
per
year,
9th-highest
of
any
state
in
the
nation.
Purchasing
a
vehicle
with
a
manufacturer’s
suggested
retail
price
(MSRP)
of
$20,000
in
Maine,
state
sales
tax
alone
would
be
$1,100.
If
that
vehicle
cost
$30,000,
the
buyer
would
pay
$1,650
in
sales
taxes.
Mainers
must
also
pay
an
annual
excise
tax
to
register
their
vehicle
with
their
municipality.
While
this
tax
varies
depending
on
the
age
of
the
vehicle,
but
the
burden
is
often
high,
especially
for
those
on
the
cusp
of
making
ends
meet.
If
those
$20,000
and
$30,000
vehicles
were
made
in
2020,
the
excise
taxes
on
each
would
be
$480
and
$720,
respectively.
Even
the
excise
tax
on
a
$20,000
car
manufactured
in
2010,
a
more
realistic
choice
for
a
low-income
family,
would
still
be
$80.
Maine’s
effective
tax
burden
on
new
automobiles
is
a
staggering
8%.
Including
registration
fee
and
possible
title
application
fee,
all
told,
the
owner
of
a
new
$20,000

vehicle
would
pay
more
than
$1,600
in
fees
and
taxes
the
first
year
they
purchased
their
car.
The
owner
of
a
new
$30,000
car
would
pay
more
than
$2,400.
This
is
not
a
good
position
for
a
state
where
the
cost
of
living
is
15%
higher
than
the
national
average,
2
with
only
the
33rd-highest
median
household
income.
3
The
vehicle
excise
tax
is
the
most
egregious
of
all
these
costs:
Mainers
are
forced—every
year—to
pay
for
something
they
already
own!
Savvy
Mainers
who
purchased
their
vehicle
in
a
private
sale,
or
even
negotiated
a
better
sale
price
with
a
dealer,
should
not
be
punished
by
being
taxed
on
a
price
they
did
not
ultimately
pay.
Please
deem
LD
1381
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
work
to
reduce
the
overall
costs
of
car
ownership
and
increase
availability
of
transportation
for
Mainers
living
in
poverty.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
