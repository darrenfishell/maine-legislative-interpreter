TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TAXATION 
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 1182 
An Act to Make Revisions to the Tax Increment Financing and Development District Laws 
April 18, 2023 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation, my name is Judy East, and I am the Director of the Bureau of Resource Information 
and Land Use Planning. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry (DACF) in opposition to LD 1182, An Act to Make Revisions to the Tax Increment 
Financing and Development District Laws.   
 
This bill amends the laws governing tax increment financing by removing the requirement that 
the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Department of Transportation 
review proposals for the designation of downtown tax increment financing districts. The bill also 
clarifies the approval condition related to a property being suitable for commercial or arts district 
uses.  
 
The Department does not support removing the review of a downtown tax increment financing 
(TIF) district by the Commissioner of Transportation or the Commissioner of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry. Such reviews can provide information to the Commissioner of 
Economic and Community Development about the growth management objectives of the 
municipality, and integration of the TIF proposal with the communityâ€™s vision as expressed in 
the Comprehensive Plan and downtown plans. Such reviews can also support the coordination of 
land use and transportation impacts enhanced by the TIF district. DACF reviews since 2009 have 
provided constructive recommendations about funding options for implementation and 
prioritizing investments, as well as providing helpful examples of other community approaches. 
Reviews have also identified missing elements critical to the analysis required by statute and 
suggested eligible planning and design studies that TIF funds support to further community 
goals. Inter-agency coordination and support to municipalities is an objective to be supported 
rather than reduced.  
 
Thank you for your time. I would happily answer any questions now or at the work session.
