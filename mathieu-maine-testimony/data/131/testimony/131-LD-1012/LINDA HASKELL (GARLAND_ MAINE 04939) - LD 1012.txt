LD1012  HP 648  RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of 
Maine Regarding the Timing of Judicial Review of the Determination of the Validity 
of Written Petitions   Opposition to LD1012 Testimony of LINDA P HASKELL 
GARLAND, MAINE  
The change of the wording on lines 12 and 13 --from "date of"-- to --"deadline for" 
would make a considerable difference in getting some petitions in on time and this 
would benefit the groups pushing this thru, instead of all parties working for a better 
system, a better state of legal process. I am against this Resolution. LINDA P
