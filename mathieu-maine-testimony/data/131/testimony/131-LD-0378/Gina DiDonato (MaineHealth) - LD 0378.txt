Testimony of Gina DiDonato, Spring Harbor Hospital, In 
Support of LD 378, “Resolve, to Eliminate the So-called Fail 
First Requirement for Children's Residential Services for 
Certain Individuals Whose Needs Are Unable to Be Met 
with Home and Community-based Services by Expanding 
Eligibility for Those Individuals ” 
Thursday, February 16, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, I am Gina 
DiDonato, Associate Chief Nursing Ofﬁcer at Spring Harbor Hospital, and 
I am here to testify in strong support of LD 378, “Resolve, to Eliminate 
the So-called Fail First Requirement for Children ‘s Residential Services 
for Certain Individuals Whose Needs Are Unable to Be Met with Home 
and Community-based Services by Expanding Eligibility for Those 
Individuals. ” 
MaineHealth is an integrated non-proﬁt health care system that provides 
the full continuum of health care services to the residents of eleven 
counties in Maine and one in New Hampshire. As part of our mission of 
“Working Together So Maine’s Communities are the Healthiest in 
America, ” MaineHealth provides a range of behavioral health services 
throughout our footprint. These range from community based outpatient 
therapy, medication management, substance use treatment and care 
management to inpatient treatment in four community hospitals and 
Spring Harbor Hospital. 
The bill before you today directs the Department of Health and Human 
Services to permanently repeal a MaineCare policy that requires a child to 
“fail” community or home-based services within the past two to six 
months before they will approve residential services. As you heard from 
the sponsor, most community or home-based services either maintain 
months-long waiting lists or simply don’t exist — especially in our mral 
communities. For children who do not have access to community-based 
services, including those in DHHS custody or those currently hospitalized, 
this MaineCare policy is preventing them from accessing the residential 
care that is needed to help them on their journey to stabilize and recover.

Attached to my testimony you’ll see the MaineCare policy that references the requirement for 
documentation that demonstrates the child’s functioning has not improved using outpatient or home and 
community-based treatment over the prior two to six months. 
I’d like to share one example of the disastrous impacts this policy can have. In December 2021, an 
adolescent was admitted to Spring Harbor Hospital after languishing in a hospital Emergency 
Department for approximately 7 weeks. Shortly after he was admitted, our clinical experts determined 
that the child needed residential care and completed the residential care application. The application was 
denied citing insufﬁcient information to support that the patient’s treatment needs could not be met bya 
lower level of care within the home or community. Our team requested reconsideration and it was again 
denied. The family, who had previously tried community-based services and could no longer safely care 
for their child at home, submitted a second appeal. A determination was not made until in early March 
2022 — over two months later — and, again, the appeal was denied. I would also note that the 
Department ’s CALOCUS-CASii, which is a process they use to determine a youth’s needed level of 
care, scored this adolescent as requiring residential care, but his application was still denied because he 
hadn’t failed a lower level of care within the past 6 months. 
In May 2022, our team re-submitted the residential application and DHHS ultimately made an exception 
to the “fail ﬁrst” rule and approved the application. It then took an additional 7 months to identify a 
residential facility that could safely care for this child’s needs. 
In December 2022, the child was transferred to a residential facility in Florida — one year after he was 
hospitalized at Spring Harbor Hospital. This patient experienced an entire year of holidays, a birthday, 
and a full year of his formative teen years in a hospital, further institutionalizing his experience at the 
highest level of care. The “fail ﬁrst” requirement prolonged his hospital stay for a full 5 months while 
we sought MaineCare ’s approval, and his year-long hospitalization cost the system $ 1.25 million. 
Unfortunately, this patient’s story is not unique. 
Spring Harbor Hospital is an acute care, locked, inpatient facility intended to safely assess and treat 
patients at the peak of their mental health crisis. Our length of stay is intended to be approximately 14 
days. It is not acceptable for a child to live in this extremely restrictive setting for a year. Based on that 
length of stay, we could have served 10 to ll other adolescent patients requiring inpatient level of care 
in the time that it took to seek MaineCare ’s approval for this one patient. 
Although DHHS is allowing exceptions to the “fail ﬁrst” rule, it is not without an extremely lengthy 
process of applications, denials, re-considerations, and appeals. This prolongs hospitalization 
unnecessarily, prevents us from providing services to patients languishing in hospital Emergency _ 
Departments with more acute treatment needs, and promotes institutionalization at an even more 
restrictive setting than residential environments. It is for that reason, I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” 
on LD 378 and permanently repeal this requirement for children in certain situations. 
Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

EPSDToCoverage for Children ’s Residential Care Facility Level of CareV 
1111121, 2022 
In certain exceptional and high-risk situations for youth under the age of 21 , the Oﬁice of MaineCare 
Services (OMS) will approve a MaineCare member’s clinical eligibility for services in a Children ’s 
Residential Care Facility (CRCF) under the Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) 
beneﬁt, MaineCare Beneﬁts Manual (MBM) Chapter II, Section 94, Without requiring an attempt to usea 
lower level of care. '' 
This exception process is targeted to situations where youth are unable to step down ﬁom long-term 
hospitalization due to a lack of community-based services, where youth are hospitalized long enough that 
they could never meet the criteria of having died home and community-based services in the prior six 
months, or where other exceptional circumstances prevent the member from being safe in a home or 
community setting. 
MaineCare members under age 21 are eligible under EPSDT for medically necessary treatment services, 
including behavioral health services, whose type, frequency, or duration exceeds what is speciﬁed in the 
MBM. MBM Section 94.05-2 describes the prior authorization (PA) process through which a provider may 
demonstrate the member’s medical need for EPSDT services, which includes addressing Why standard MBM 
services are inappropriate or insufficient to meet the mernber’s needs. For behavioral health services, Kepro, 
on behalf of the Department, conducts assessments using a standardized instrument (CALOCUS-CASII) 
with the goal of determining the appropriate level of care which would be the most effective and least 
restrictive enviromnent. 
Kepro will use deﬁned criteria that take into consideration the overall intent of MBM Section 97.02(A)(5) to 
promote the least restrictive level of care, as well as the EP SDT process under MBM Section 94.05-2 to 
approve CRCF services under EPSDT.
