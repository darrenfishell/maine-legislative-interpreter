In Support Of  
 
LD 1370 - An Act to Simplify the School Budget Validation Process  
 
May 2 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs 
Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony in support of  
LD 1370 on behalf of Maine Municipal  Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes 
the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Local leaders support the measure to consider p lacing t he article for the  continued use of the budget 
validation referendum process on the next general election ballot in November of the third year following 
the vote on that question. It has been proven that voter turnout is higher at an election held concurrently with a general election, and it makes sense to put the budget validation referendum process question on this ballot.  
 Of equal importance to municipal officials is ensuring that all community members have a voice. Allowing this question to be placed on the November ballot would capture the votes of those who may not typically 
cast a vote in a budget validation referendum election. Furthermore, this process would help to eliminate 
confusion by mirroring the process  used for a community to withdr aw from a Regional School Unit.  
 
The amendment presented yesterday would provide for opting  into the budget validation referendum 
process. This would still allow for local control and communities could do what is best for their residents.  
 For these reasons the LPC is supportive of LD 1370. T hank you for your time and for considering the 
municipal perspective on this issue.
