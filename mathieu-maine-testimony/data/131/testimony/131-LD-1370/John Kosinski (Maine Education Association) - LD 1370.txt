Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other esteemed members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, 
My name 1S John Kosinski (he/him), and I am proud to serve as the Director of Government Relations 
for the Maine Education Association ﬂ\/IEA) The MEA represents 24,000 educators in the state of 
Maine, including teachers and other professionals m nearly every public school in the state and faculty 
and other professional staff m the University of Maine and Community College Systems 
I am here today to testify on behalf of the MEA in opposition to LD 1300, An Act to Give the Governing 
Board of a Municipality Input into the Budget Developed by a School Board, in support of LD 1370, as 
amended, An Act to Simplijy the School Budget Validation Process, and in support of LD 1748, An Act 
to Reform the School, Budget Referendum Process by Limiting the Circumstances in Which Referenda 
Occur 
In opposition to LD 1300, An Act to Give the Governing Board of a Municipality Input into the Budget 
Developed by a School Board 
The MEA has been consistently frustrated about the current school budget process, particularly m 
municipal school districts In these cities, the school budget must ﬁrst be approved by the school 
committee and then approved by the city council prior to going to voters for approval This city council 
review of the school budget almost always results in school committees being told they need to cut their 
proposed budgets In fact, over the past few weeks, the city council n1 Lewiston has demanded cuts to 
the Lewiston School budget, this despite the fact the city 1S receiving $800,000 more in state aid and

despite the decline m the required local mil rate Repeatedly, city councils push school budgets 
downward before they will allow voters the ability to vote up or down This is especially frustratmg 
because school board members are often chosen by the exact same voters who decide city council races 
The structure seems ﬂawed whereby one set of councilors, elected by the same people, can thwart the 
ability of school board members to advocate for the budgets their schools need, and their students 
deserve (It is important to note, m some cities, the town budget does not require voter approval — only 
the school budget)‘ 
LD 1300 proposes to take this ﬂawed system and apply it to all school districts, mcluding regional 
school units (RSUs) and school adrmnistrative districts (SADs) Not only will this create a bottleneck in 
seeking voter approval of budgets as each town in a school district is given the opportimity to debate the 
school budget but will most certainly result m a further ratcheting down of school fimdmg across the 
state Any one town council m an RSU or SAD could refuse to allow a budget to go before voters 
without additional cuts Given what we have seen in our cities, we can only expect if this proposal 
moves forward that we will ﬁnd it even harder to get fair and adequate school budgets approved 
In support of LD 1370. as amended. An Act to Simpliﬁz the School Budget Validation Process and in 
support of LD 1748, An Act to Reform the School Budget Referendum Process by Limiting the 
Circumstances in Which Referenda Occur 
LD 1370, as amended, seeks to simplify the school budget validation process by removing the state 
mandate to require an election by voters of school budgets 
Already, school board members must be elected by voters to serve and often seats are up for election 
every three years What is more, RSUs and SADs must have budget meetings where residents get to 
learn about the lme items proposed m the school budget and get to approve or amend the proposed 
budget through votes We encourage the Committee to consider allowing duly elected school board 
members to establish school budgets through their local process The bill, as amended, would still allow 
a local ordinance or charter to require voter approval, but the state will no longer mandate these elections 
take place The school budget validation process is a remnant of the school consolidation laws and can 
and should be replaced 
We also support LD 1748 This too would remove the requirement to hold an election on the school 
budget every year, and mstead empower voters to petition for an election if they feel the budget is not 
suitable for their town(s) The bill proposes voters m a district submit a petition to the city within 30 
days of adoption of the school budget If enough signatures are collected, an election is held 
Both LD 1370 as amended, and LD 1748 provide a safety valve to address signiﬁcant community 
concem about school budgets should concerns arise

We all want and support public schools and we want students to thrive But the current structure for 
school budgets is cumbersome and complicated and often results in schools not securing the fundnig 
they need Many districts conduct an annual assessment of the funding pnorities in their district They 
propose a budget to the school board, which often gets whittled down In some cases, the city council 
then gets to demand additional cuts The cunrent structure is inhibiting the ability for school boards to 
advocate for the budgets they need Change 1S in order We hope the Comimttee will empower school 
boards by passing LD 1370 (as amended) and/or LD 1748 
Thank you for your time and your service to the people of Maine I will do my best to _ answer any 
questions you may have
