LD 1370
I am writing to oppose this well-intentioned legislation because under the right 
circumstances, it could create a perverse incentive for supporters of local school 
budgets not to vote in referenda. If a 25 percent turnout threshold is required for a 
school budget to fail, the smart move will be for supporters of the budget to not vote 
at all. The legislature should not adopt legislation which discourages people from 
voting, or makes their preferred outcome less likely if they turn out to vote for it.
Fortunately, there is another bill pending that better addresses the many problems 
with the current school budget referendum process. The Committee should adopt LD 
1748, and reject LD 1370.
