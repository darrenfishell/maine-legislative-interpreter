LD 1370
I want to voice my opposition to LD 1370, an act proposed to streamline the school 
budget validation procedure.
My concern is rooted in the belief that this act, if passed, would unduly empower 
school boards, consequently complicating the process for voters to dismiss 
unacceptable school budgets.
Under the present system in Maine, school budgets are subject to voter approval every
three years via a referendum. While this process may be time-consuming, it serves as 
an essential mechanism to enforce the accountability of schools towards the voters.
LD 1370, however, seeks to discard these referendums, allowing school boards the 
liberty to pass budgets without voter approval. In effect, this grants school boards 
greater control over our tax funds and reduces our ability to demand accountability 
from them.
Another concern is that LD 1370 could impede voters' ability to reject unfavorable 
school budgets. Presently, a budget is deemed rejected if a majority votes against it. 
But LD 1370 proposes a change where a budget would be rejected only if the majority
of the referendum voters vote against it. This amendment could result in a situation 
where a budget is approved, despite significant numbers of voters not participating in 
the referendum.
Considering the above points, I implore you to vote against LD 1370. Thank you for 
considering my viewpoint.
