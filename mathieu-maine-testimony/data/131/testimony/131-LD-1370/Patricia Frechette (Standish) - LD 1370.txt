LD 1370
Dear Committee Members:
My opposition to LD 1370 lies in that the referendum would become void, and allow 
the budget to pass, if less than 25% of those that voted in the last gubernatorial 
election vote during the budget referendum.  
This bill does not make sense at all.  Voting in years that are not big election years are
minimal.  Why would you want to increase the average to 25% unless you want to 
take away the rights of the voters?
PLEASE VOTE OUGHT NOT TO PASS, Thank you
