Re: LD 1370 – An Act for Simplify  the School  Budget  Validation  Process  
 
Position: Oppose 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is opposed to LD 1370 and we thank you for the 
opportunity to outline our points for your Committee. 
 
Our members expressed concern over changing the vote on the question of whether to continue 
the budget validation referendum process to the date of the general election in November. Doing 
so would create the need for an additional ballot, resulting in higher programming and printing 
costs. For hand-count municipalities, adding an additional ballot during a general election will 
greatly increase the time spent counting ballots after the close of polls. Furthermore, voting on 
this question on a date separate from the budget validation election will add to voter confusion. 
 
Clerks seek clarification on lines 33 through 39, which state that a budget validation referendum 
may not be considered valid unless 25% or more of the total number of voters who participated 
in the last gubernatorial election in the school district vote. The paragraph also states that if the 
number of voters is less than 25%, the budget is considered to be approved. These sentences are 
contradictory.   
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at
