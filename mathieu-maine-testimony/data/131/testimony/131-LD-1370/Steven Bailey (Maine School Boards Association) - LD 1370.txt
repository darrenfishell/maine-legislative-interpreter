TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1370 
AN ACT TO SIMPLTFY THE SCHOOL BUDGET VALIDATION PROCESS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 1370. 
The amended version of this legislation says districts no longer have to vote on the Budget Validation 
Referendum (BVR) every three years, but they can do so if they choose to at the ballot box. The language on 
the ballot will ask voters if they wish to use the budget validation process that would no longer be required by 
the state. 
An article asking that question can be put on the ballot either by a majority of the regional school board or by 
a written petition of 10% of voters voting in the last gubernatorial election. 
The vote on the question will be asked in the November election, when tumout is higher, and the opt-in 
language must be approved in an election where 25 percent of the total number of voters cast a ballot. We 
believe that helps assure there is representation of the community. 
MS SA and MSBA both support the language changes in L.D. 1370, given the experiences school districts 
have had since the implementation of the BVR. It has been seen that those districts who removed the need for 
the BVR continue to be happy with their decision, and those districts who have voted to continue the BVR 
continue to express their desire to keep it. L.D. 1370 would provide this option.
