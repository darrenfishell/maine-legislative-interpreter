LD 1698
LD1698 An Act to Eliminate Private Donations to the Maine Clean Elections Fund, 
LINDA HASKELL, I Oppose LD1698. There are "many" good features in LD1698 
that have been lined out. That certainly does not render this a Maine Clean Elections 
Fund by removing safety specifications. The title does not qualify for the damage that 
would be done to this Legal Document
Why was the time set to 9:05 instead of 9:00. Possibly to set people testifying off 
guard as to the introduction of this Act.
