Re: LD 1082 – An Act to Advance the Maine Retirement Savings Program 
 
This statement in support of Section 6 is on behalf of the thousands of small business owners in Maine 
who are members of the National Federation of Independent Business.  Member businesses collectively 
span a wide range of economic activities; provide jobs and paychecks to about 30,000 people; and, they 
help form the economic backbone of hundreds of communities and the state.  
 
A delay of the program phase-in and giving authority for the Retirement Savings board 
to learn from a pilot program will be welcome adjustments. 
 
NFIB members are concerned about the additional paperwork and compliance costs associated with the 
Retirement Savings Program.  Most small businesses do not have a human resource person on staff; the 
duties associated with the Retirement Savings Program will fall on the shoulders of people already 
tasked with numerous other duties.  Also, small employers with seasonal staffing fluctuations may 
experience extra compliance challenges – and, likewise, with small employers that have high turnover 
rates due to the nature of the business or characteristics of the workforce. 
 
NFIB looks forward to working with the Retirement Savings Board to facilitate understanding of among 
small employers of their new obligations. 
 
Thank you for considering the interests of Maine small business owners.
