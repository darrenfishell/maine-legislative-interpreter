Testimony in Support of LD 1082 " An Act to Advance the Maine Retirement Savings Program " 
 
Greetings Senator Bailey, Representative Perry , and honorable members of the Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services . 
 
My name is Alf Anderson  and I am an Advocacy and Outreach Director with  AARP 
Maine. AARP Maine is a non -partisan, non -profit organization with more than  200,000  
members statewide. I’m submitting this testimony  today IN SUPPORT OF  L.D. 1082 . 
 
The proposed changes to the Maine Retirement Savings Program  within this bill will allow the 
Maine Retirement Savings  Board to effectively roll out the program over a more realistic  
timeframe. Specifically, the implementation timeline will allow for more education of the 
program and afford employers a better understanding of their participation.  
 
AARP has been engaged  in launchin g similar programs in other states  over the past several  
years . This experience has demonstrated to us the importance of taking the necessary time to 
ensure that Maine’s  program will meet the needs of our workforce. AARP Maine is eager to see 
the Maine  Retirement Savings Program up and running so that all Mainers will be able to 
adequately save for their retirement.  
 
However, it is of the utmost importance that the program be implemented properly so that 
employees an d employers will be well positioned to take advantage from day one.  We hope 
you will take the se concerns to heart when deliberating on LD  1082.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on this important bill. If you have questions 
for me, I can be reached at aanderson@aarp.org  or at 207 -330-1147.  
 
Sincerely , 
 
Alf Anderson  
Associate State Director, Advocacy & Outreach
