SUBJECT:  Testimony on L.D. 1082  â€“ An Act to Advance the Maine Retirement Savings 
Program  
 
MainePERS is submitting written testimony neither for nor against L.D. 1082, specifically 
section 15 of the bill, which is the only section that pertains to MainePERS.  
 
In addition to the defined benefits that it administers, MainePERS provides 401(a), 457, and 
403(b) plans through its MaineSTART Program.  Those plans are currently available to 
employees  who are eligible for membership in one of the defined benefit programs 
administered by MainePERS and whose employers elect to participate in those plans.   L.D. 
1082 would  expand those eligible to participate in the defined contribution, deferred 
compensation and tax -shelter annuity plans offered by MainePERS to include employees of 
the Maine Retirement Savings Board.    
 
MainePERS has no concerns with this language as proposed.  
 
Thank you for your consideration of this testim ony.  We are available to attend your work 
session  if you have questions .
