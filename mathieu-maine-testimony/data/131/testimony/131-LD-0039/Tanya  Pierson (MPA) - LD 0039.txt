LD 39
“An Act to Amend the Maine Juvenile” 
Public Hearing Date: February 13, 2023

Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee
My name is Tanya Pierson and I am an Assistant District Attorney for York County Maine. I have 
spent the vast majority of my 33 year career helping to create and administer a juvenile docket in 
York County.  I am one of approximately eight prosecutors statewide who primarily handle a 
juvenile caseload.  I am here before you today on behalf of the Maine Prosecutors Association 
(MPA), specifically the District Attorneys, to provide testimony on LD 39.
Overall, the Maine Prosecutors Association is in support of LD 39, which we view primarily as a 
bill to clarify existing law without creating any significant substantive changes. Most of the 
proposed changes contained in LD 39 would help to define the implementation of the existing 
Juvenile Code and its purposes as laid out in Title 15 Section 3002. There are several specific 
recommendations the MPA has for the bill, and for this reason, as of today we are neither for nor 
against LD 39. These recommendations have been explained to the Department of Corrections; I 
anticipate amendments will be brought forth and discussed further at the workgroup session. If 
these amendments are proposed, the MPA is likely to be in full support of LD 39.
The MPA would suggest following amendments to LD 39:
1). Section 1.  15 MRSA Section 3003, sub-section 14    
Amendment of the definition of a “juvenile.” During the 130th Maine Legislature, LD 320 was 
passed which changed the definition of a “juvenile” under the Juvenile Code.  In the MPA’s 
opinion, this change was unnecessary and actually had the effect of removing youth from the 
jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court and the Department of Corrections’ Juvenile Services.  Under the 
definitional change that occurred with LD 320, youth who are adjudicated of a juvenile offense 
after they have turned 18, cannot be placed on a juvenile probation or be committed to the Long 
Creek Youth Development Center, unless they have engaged in new criminal conduct as an adult.   
We strongly support the Court’s authority to sentence youth to juvenile probation, or a commitment 
to Long Creek, for a juvenile offense, even if they have turned 18.   LD 39 attempts to address this      STATE OF MAINE144 SwedStreet

2issue, however it is the MPA’s position that the simplest fix is to return to the definition that existed 
prior to the passage of LD 320, which stated the following:
Juvenile. “Juvenile” means any person who has not attained 18 years of age (Italics 
added).
Along with other provisions contained within the Juvenile Code, this definition is the cleanest and 
most succinct wording and all that is necessary to ensure youth who are 18 years of age or older, 
but have outstanding juvenile charges, remain under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court and DOC 
for those juvenile offenses. 
Sec. 5  15 MRSA Section 3314-C, sub-section 8.
This amendment would bring the Juvenile Code into substantial compliance with the Adult 
Criminal Code simply for purposes of payment and collection of restitution.  However, LD 39 is 
lacking several provisions that are contained in Title 17-A that we believe should also be included 
in the proposed bill. Specifically Sections 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2018.  The restitution provisions 
under the Juvenile Code underwent significant legislative changes in 2019; the addition of these 
sections and those already outlined in LD 39 would not be in conflict with the existing law as 
amended in 2019.
The MPA would further respectfully request review of a provision that went into effect under the 
2019, legislative changes with regard to the definition of a “victim” under Title 15 Section       
3314-C(4).  Currently an authorized claimant can only be a natural person, or a dependent of a 
deceased victim (Italics added).  This definition of a victim prohibits the Juvenile Court from 
ordering a juvenile to pay restitution to a business or governmental entity.  
Thank you for your attention and time.
