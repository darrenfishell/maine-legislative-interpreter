Snapshot Analysis of Maine Supply and Demand 
Analysis 
By Dr. Michael Sofis 
Key Findings Comparing 2021 vs. 2022 Adult Use Supply and Demand 
Table 1 below shows estimated adult use demand and supply using the Regulatory Determinants of 
Cannabis Outcomes Survey data (demand) and track and trace data supplied by the Office of the 
Cannabis Policy (supply). Highlights are noted below: 
v Demand for adult use cannabis in Maine increased by about 25% from 2021 to 2022. 
o Cannabis supply (dry weight) about doubled from 30 to 78 million grams from 2021 to 2022. 
o The ratio of supply (grams) to adult use demand (grams), an increasing relevant index of market 
equilibrium, showed a statistically significant increase from a ratio of 3.21 to 4.79 (p <.01).1 
o Together, these findings suggest that despite considerable gains in demand for adult use 
cannabis when comparing 2022 to 2021, the increase in supply outpaced the rise in demand, 
therefore inducing a net increase in the ratio of supply to demand ratio. 
0 Although the exact optimal supply to demand ratio is unknown, multiple states with 2:1 ratios 
have seen rapid declines in price per gram in their adult use markets in 2022, which suggests that 
it would be prudent for state adult use programs like Maine to endeavor to reach ratios below 2:1 
supply to demand ratios. 
o In the fairly likely event that adult use demand in Maine stays relatively stable in 2023 relative to 
2022, there would need to be at least a 60% reduction in the amount of supply to reach a market 
equilibrium. A 60% correction is very unlikely to occur naturally as a part of a free-market 
adjustment.

Table 1. Supply and Demand in Grams 
Additional Supply-Side Context 
Figure 1 below shows that simply taking the month of adult use cannabis implementation in Maine 
accounts for 90% of all theoretically possible statistical prediction of rise in harvest plants. This finding is 
congruent with the findings from Table 1, and provides additional support for the assertion that supply is 
growing at a pace faster than would likely be ideal for obtaining market equilibrium. 
Moreover, given that Maine’s adult use program saw considerable adult use demand gains in 2021 
compared to 2020, and in 2022 compared to 2021, it is unlikely that similarly notable gains in demand will 
be achieved in 2023. Because of this, continued supply growth would be more problematic because there 
would be less growth in adult use demand to offset continued increases in oversupply.

Month of AU Implementation 
Notably, Figure 1 also shows that in the six months leading up to and through January of 2023, there 
appears to have been a disproportionate slowing in supply per month that is not accounted for by 
seasonality. In other words, Maine's adult use market may be partially self-correcting the current 
oversupply, although it is too early to identify if this trend is coincidental, or indicative of an ongoing trend. 
Despite this potential for a natural correction in the market, the level of correction needed to achieve less 
than a 2:1 supply to demand ratio is considerable. ln the fairly likely event that adult use demand stays 
relatively stable in 2023 relative to 2022, there would need to be at least a 60% reduction in the amount of 
supply to reach a likely equilibrium. It is unlikely that the remaining 60% correction that is needed will 
occur naturally. If it did, it would be unprecedented relative to what has been observed in the growing 
number of other states struggling with oversupply issues in their respective adult use markets.
