Public Testimony — LD 1391 ~— Opposed 
Good Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and distinguished members of the 
joint committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. My name is Joel Pepin, I ama 
resident of Standish. l am the President of the Maine Cannabis Industry 
Association. 
MCIA is opposed to LD 1391. This bill would limit the production and supply of 
cannabis in Maine's Adult Use ﬁannabis program. MCIA has always advocated for 
a regulated, fair and open market for all cannabis operators. This legislation would 
cap the market, essentially for the ﬁrst-time making cannabis a ‘limited license’ 
industry here in Maine. This goes against the collective values that MClA’s 
members share and against the rich cannabis history Maine has fostered over the 
last decade plus. 
MCIA is also frustrated to learn that OCP is in support of this legislation. We found 
out last week in a stakeholder conversation with OCP that they would be support 
1391, after we asked about OCP's position. MCIA has worked hard over the years 
to maintain an open and transparent relationship with our regulator. We urge OCP 
to focus on and support efforts that increase the size of our regulated cannabis 
markets, not stiﬂe it.
Please do not pass this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Joel Pepin 
President
