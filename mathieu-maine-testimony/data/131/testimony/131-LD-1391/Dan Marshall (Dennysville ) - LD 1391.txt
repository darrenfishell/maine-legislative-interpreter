Limited licenses are inherently unconstitutional, one large company could sue the 
state and gain access or capital. It also keeps marginalized groups from gaining access
to cannabis licenses. In my part of the state adult use licenses haven’t even been 
considered yet as it’s not viable with the taxing involved. This would cut off rural 
areas to licenses when it does become viable.
