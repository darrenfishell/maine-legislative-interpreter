Get Big or Get Out. 
With this statement, Earl Butz and the USDA used government overregulation and 
corporate bail-outs to drive the American small farmer out of business. These effects 
have been felt extremely hard here in Maine, by your local farmers. 
Over the past 5 decades, the decisions made by government based on this ideology 
have done more harm to our nation's health, stability, and wealth than most are aware 
of. 
This bill follows that same ideology, telling small farmers and producers that their 
success is not as important as the succes of large corporations and their shareholders.
This mentality pushes out families, splinters communities, and lowers the quality of 
medicine available to Mainers across the state. That is unacceptable. If they can't run 
a profitable business, it is not on us as taxpayers to pay to keep them afloat. 
Vote against LD 1391 and support small farmers, thank you.
