I am a maine medical caregiver that for the last 2 years have been battling to get my 
auduot use retail license.  I am now working on getting my grow license switched 
over to adult use cultivation.  I will be extremely disappointed if riggt as I go to get 
into adult use after 5 years of medical and 2 years of getting my town to pass their 
ordinance, that you guys would limit licenses.  Our market doesnâ€™t need more 
regulation. The only reason the black market exists is because of over regulation.  Do 
not csp the licenses. Maybe make size restrictions.  And definitely work on making 
the excise tax more affordable.  That will do a lot more for the program that needless 
over regulation
