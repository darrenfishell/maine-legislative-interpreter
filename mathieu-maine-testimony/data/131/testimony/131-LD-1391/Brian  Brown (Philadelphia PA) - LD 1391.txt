I currently live in a limited cannabis market state. Limiting cannabis producers creates
a market people do not want to use. In PA the entire market is limited to 22 
companies. The products are over-priced, low quality and mostly produced by out of 
state headquartered corporations. The state is capturing probably 10% of the stateâ€™s 
cannabis market. most people still use the traditional market or go out of state to 
better markets. Maine has long been known a place to get high quality cannabis 
grown by locals. Limiting the amount of licenses available will harm local small 
businesses and the consumers who want to patronize them. This would be an 
unnecessary step backwards for Maine. I never understood why free market 
competition is praises by both sides of the aisle except when it comes to cannabis.
