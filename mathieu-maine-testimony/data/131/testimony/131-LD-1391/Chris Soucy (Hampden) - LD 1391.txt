LD 1391
LD 1391 does not seek to "protect" the cannabis market in Maine. It seeks to protect 
the market share of existing large operators who've made bad investments and fear 
they'll be unable to profit in a free market with their subpar quality product. 
Reducing competition does not protect the quality of cannabis for consumers. 
Reducing competition does not help small cultivators (personal use and medical alike)
who may wish to enter the adult-use market at a later date as they grow their business.
In fact, it's decidedly working against this group. Reducing competition does, 
however, work to protect the investments of large operators with no interest in Maine 
cannabis cultivators, Maine cannabis consumers, or Maine cannabis culture. 
LD 1391 would hurt the Maine cannabis industry, and would only benefit a select, 
self-interested, few. It would enable mediocrity to thrive, reduce the options of 
consumers, and lead to greater inequity in our state's cannabis industry.
