Good morning Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and honorable members 
of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.  
I am submitting this testimony in opposition to ld 1391. This proposed controlled 
market is artificial.  A cap on canopy licensing as opposed to a cap on canopy size 
only helps the corporate monopolies push out the moms and pops of Maine. What is 
needed to control the overload in the market is a canopy cap that does not allow any 
one person not company to control more than 5000 to 7000 square foot of mature 
plant canopy. This would regulate the market supply allowing the best to survive 
market fluctuations. 
 Please deem the bill ought not to pass.
