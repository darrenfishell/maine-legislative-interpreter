 Tes�mony of Jeﬀ McCabe  
Maine Service Employees Associa�on, SEIU Local 1989  
 
In Support of LD 1513 , An Act to Improve Intensive Behavioral Health and Public Safety Case 
Management Services , 
Sponsored by Representa�ve Holly Stover  
 
Before the Joint Standing Commitee on Health and Human Services,  
1 PM Wednesday , May 3 , 203, Cross Building Room 209  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representa�ve Meyer, members of the Commitee on Health and Human Services, I’m Jeﬀ McCabe, director of poli�cs and legisla�on for the Maine Service Employees Associa�on, Local 1989 of the Service Employees Interna�onal Union. We are a labor union represen�ng over 13,000 Maine workers, including workers who serve as Intensive Case Managers for the Maine Department of Health 
and Human Services. We’re here in support of LD 1513 .  
 
This legisla�on would provide a s�pend of $5 per hour for workers in  the Intensive Case Manager job 
classiﬁca�on and a $1 per hour s�pend for those Intensive Case Managers who are holding or obtaining a relevant master’s degree. As you may know, similar s�pends are already being provided to caseworkers within the Maine  DHHS Oﬃce of Child and Family Services (OCFS) to aid in their 
recruitment and reten�on. LD 1513  merely would treat Intensive Case Managers the same as OCFS 
caseworkers in terms of s�pends.   LD 1513 , the subject of this hearing, focuses exclusively on  the Intensive Case Manager job classiﬁca�on 
at Maine DHHS. LD 1513  is necessary because the ongoing public employee recruitment and reten�on 
problem in Maine State Government is par�cularly acute for Intensive Case Managers. 
Please take a 
look at their job descrip�on linked here . It notes they provide crucial services in Maine to what the 
Maine Bureau of Human Resources calls a “ targeted group of high -risk mental health clients in a local 
community.  According to the bureau, the individuals with whom Intensive Case Managers work are 
“most problema�c/high risk mental health clients.” Intensive Case Managers are the ones who support 
their integra�on into the community.  
 This is clearly diﬃcult and dangerous work, yet the State has consistently fallen short when it comes to respec�ng, protec�ng and paying these workers fairly for their labor. Members of our union con�nue to 
demand the State make progress on addressing the low wages that Maine State Government pays State 
employees. As you may know, on average, State employees make 15% less than their counterparts throughout New England, even a�er adjus�ng for regional pay diﬀerences, according to the 
State of 
Maine Market Study Report d ated Nov. 20, 2020. The problem of recrui�ng and retaining state workers 
is rampant throughout all departments of Maine State Government  with  one in six posi�ons in Maine 
State Government currently vacant . O ur union’s past presiden t, Ramona Welton, highlighted  the 
recruitment and reten�on problem and the state employee pay gap, both as they relate to the recently projected state revenue surpluses, in 
an op -ed column in yesterday ’s Bangor Daily News . A copy of her 
column is atached to this tes�mony.  
 
You may remember that last session , the Commitee passed similar legisla�on, LD 1915; unfortunately, 
that legisla�on died on the Special Appropria�ons Table. Of the nine intensive case managers who 
tes�ﬁed  on LD 1915  last session, four of them are no longer working as ICMs. This is just one example of 
the reten�on issues among ICMs . Passing and ensuring funding for LD 1 915 would have gone a long way 
   
 
  2 
 toward retaining the talented and skilled intensive case managers currently serving in these roles. You 
can view the tes�monies  from LD 1915 here . 
 Fortunately,  there is a nother  solu�on to help recruit and retain Intensive Case Managers and to show 
them the respect they have  earned doing this most diﬃcult work on behalf of all Maine people. LD 1 513 
would go a  long way toward both addressing the pay gap and the recruitment and reten�on problem for 
these workers.  
 Thank you and I would be glad to answer any ques�ons.

Maine’s budget ‘surplus’ comes from 
underpaying state workers  
May 3, 2023  
Bangor  Daily News  
By Ramona Welton  
Ramona Welton of Augusta is the past president of the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union. She is in her 39th year as an auditor for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles within the Maine secretary of state’ s office.
 
As a process auditor in my 39th year of service with the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles, I know when things add up and when they don’t. 
 
Yet again, strong increases in state government revenues  are predicted for the coming years on 
top of the recently projected $283 million surplus . This follows a trend of several years of recent 
surpluses. While this is good news, there’s a caveat: These surpluses are a direct result of the state government underpaying thousands of state workers throughout our careers. Not one but two state -commissioned reports found the state consistently lowballs pay for state workers 
compared with other public- and private-sector workers throughout Maine and New England.
 
A 2009 report  documented that Maine Department of Transporta�on crews were underpaid by 21.6 
percent; professionals like engineers and chemists, 17 percent; ins�tu�onal workers, 11.8 percent; and 
supervisory workers, 9.6 percent. The Baldacci administra�on essen�ally responded by stamping the report “conﬁden�al” and ins�tu�ng 
20 unpaid state worker furlough days , further reducing state 
workers’ wages.  
Under the LePage administration, state workers went four years without raises and the pensions 
of state workers and teachers were cut  to pay for tax breaks that mostly benefited Maine’s 
wealthiest residents. LePage left hundreds of positions vacant, worsening a crisis in delivering 
services from plowing snow to answering 911 calls to staffing our psychiatric centers.  
Data from 2020  show we’re paid 15 percent less than our peers in the private and public sector in 
Maine and across New England. For some classifications, it’s worse: Accountants are underpaid by 20 percent to 33 percent; chemists, 24 percent; civil engineers, 20 percent to 25 percent; mechanics, 31 percent; and correctional officers, 16 percent.
 
Since then, wage growth for state workers has lagged far behind that of the average Maine worker. In 2022, Mainers saw average raises worth 8.6 percent
, while state workers’ pay 
increased only 4 percent. With most employers competing in a tightening labor market, the average worker saw double the nominal raises state workers did, and the pay gap continued to grow.

 State job postings  tell the story: Custodians, laborers, groundskeepers, park rangers and assistant 
rangers start at $15 an hour; legal secretaries, $15.85; egg and poultry inspectors, $16.20; 
accounts -payable clerks, $16.30; and accountants, $18.94. State commissioners , environmental 
groups , state workers  and their unions  all say the state must address this wage problem. The 
impact on services is real. One in 6 positions in state government is vacant  — totaling nearly 
2,100 vacancies. The reward for those who keep working for the state: forced overtime.  
When you’re plowing roads, answering 911 calls or working with children and families in crisis, the mental and physical exhaustion of excessive overtime runs the risk of becoming a serious public safety concern. And when the Maine Department of Environmental Protection or Maine 
State Ferry Service are understaffed, as they’ve been for years now, it affects our economy.
 
Currently state workers are in contract nego�a�ons, yet the Bureau of Human Resources has refused to 
meet with us . Given how far behind the state has fallen, it’s no mystery why the state HR director 
does n’t want to meet with all state workers. It’d be diﬃcult to defend this stark inequity in front of an 
audience of your own employees.  
As one of Maine’s largest employers, the state of Maine has a duty to create fair standards for 
workers across Maine. I nstead, the state is actually applying downward pressure on wages as it 
competes with industries for the same pool of workers.  
Some have suggested using the supposed surplus  for tax cuts for the wealthiest Mainers . This is 
offensive; the last round of income tax cuts in 2011 were paid for by dramatically cutting the retirement benefits of state workers and teachers, who don’t even receive Social Security benefits. 
 
To be clear, while neither Gov. Janet Mills nor the 131st Legislature created these issues, they have a responsibility to fix them.
