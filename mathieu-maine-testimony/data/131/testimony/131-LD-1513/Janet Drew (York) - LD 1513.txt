York
LD 1513
 I don't comment here on this bill's specific provisions, I do say that
 Maine and the US need to use proven interventions to address our mental health 
crisis.  We pay a lot of tax $$ for cops and jails, arresting & housing poor and sick 
people behind closed doors harming kids, families & communities
$upport struggling families, fund school and creative social supports & restorative 
justice
Please
Fund mental health care, as a chronic illness.
We pay big bucks for medical procedures and surgeries
We waste a fortune on 24/7 cops and jails, arresting poor and sick people & caging 
them out of sight. 
Please $upport struggling families, fund school, regional partnerships and social 
supports. Budgets matter !!
Fund mental health care, as a chronic illness.  
It isn't like surgery.
