My name is Craig Dore, former employee of Maine General. 22years of service, 
perfect attendance, management position, respected and appreciated by all.I  do miss 
the people. My director stated that he would hire me back in a heartbeat when/if 
mandate is dropped. I was also a former police officer, firefighter, substitute school 
teacher and owner of two businesses. I volunteered as a varsity soccer coach (from 
developmental level years ago). I also served my country right out of high-school. 
MaineGeneral was forced to fire me due to the mandate, alone. I now live in Florida 
working for the state as an Adult Protective Investigator. We still own our home in 
Benton and have three amazing daughters.
Thanks for listening. 
Craig Dore
