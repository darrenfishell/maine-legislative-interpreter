LD 172
I am hear testify in support of LD 172 and LD 59.
Children do not need COVID 19 vaccines because of their immunity strong bodies. 
Evidence has shown this vaccine does not help in preventing transmitting the disease 
and less children put in their body the better.  I am hearing that general vaccines is 
taking great negative effects on our kids in brain development.  Statistics has shown 
their are more kids today with Autism then ever before in history. So please carefully 
review the facts before passing LD 59.
LD 172 please vote to pass. We need to move forward not backwards in Maine and 
create incentives for top medical professionals from around the country into Maine to 
help Maine sickly citizens get better. I can witness to Since COVID, the hospitals, 
offices, are empty and shorthanded of staff and nurses and doctors. The staff and 
professionals are working overtime and probably burned out because of the shortage 
of workers.  There are long waiting lists 3 months for patients a person can die before 
they get any help from their doctor.
Please do not let Maine become like Canada with long waiting lists and lack of 
doctors. Please lift the immunization mandate and return our doctors and nurses to the
medical field.  I have a nurse friend who was fired because she refused the COVID 
vaccine. America was once the greatest in the world in the medical area for 
technology and expertise, but since COVID all the best doctors left Maine or found 
another profession.  Please restore our medical to be great again.  For the best of 
Maine.
Thank for your time.
