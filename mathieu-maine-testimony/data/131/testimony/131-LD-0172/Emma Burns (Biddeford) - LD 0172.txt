Testimony in favor of LD 172, An Act to Allow Health Care Workers to Return to 
Work by Reinstating Exemptions from Immunization Requirements
April 24, 2023
My name is Emma Burns, a registered nurse, wife, mother, and homeowner here in 
the state of Maine. My family has been greatly impacted from the passing of LD 798. 
I used to previously be granted an exemption until the law changed. I am no longer 
able to work as a nurse in the state of Maine due to the above laws. I'll be clear, I 
absolutely love being a nurse and I will be back in a heartbeat if this is overturned. I 
am one more nurse, one more healthcare professional that is being kept away from 
staffing a state that already has a serious staffing issue.
My family is impacted as well. My children will be added to the numbers that will not
attend the school system here in Maine. 
Due to the limitations of LD 798, if nothing changes, we will plan to relocate to a 
state where we will have more freedom. Maine will lose yet another young family, 
two more healthcare professionals (my husband being a Nurse Anesthetist), and three 
beautiful children who will not be brought up here. 
Please vote in favor of LD 172. Please allow this loving nurse back in employment in 
Maine, please keep a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist here in Maine, and 
please allow three young children to grow, thrive, and be the next generation here in 
Maine.
Thank you,
Emma Burns
