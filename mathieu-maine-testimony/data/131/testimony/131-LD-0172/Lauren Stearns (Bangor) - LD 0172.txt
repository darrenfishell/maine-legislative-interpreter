Testimony 
My name is Lauren Steams and I am a registered nurse of ten years, and a resident of Bangor, Maine. In August 2022, 
my employer, St. Joseph's hospital, was required by the state of Maine to stop honoring their covid vaccine exemption 
option for nursing moms that had been in place. l had been an RN in the recovery room for four years at that time and as 
I was still nursing my son and did not feel comfortable with the vaccination, l had to resign from my position, with no 
eligibility for unemployment or other resources. Three other RNs in my unit alone resigned for the same reason. Once 
resigned, because exemptions are not honored at this time, other job opportunities are extremely limited for healthcare 
workers. lt is hard on managers stafﬁng their units as well. The shift in finances is considerable for my family of course, 
yet a bigger issue that weighs on me was having to leave my coworkers and managers. I felt that they did not deserve to 
lose a valuable team member, three in fact, as a result of this mandate, in one small unit where staffing is already an 
issue. The burden that it creates not only for the displaced worker but for the units left without employees with years of 
invaluable training and healthcare experience is the reason I am testifying today for An Act to Allow Health Care Workers 
to Return to Work by Reinstating Exemptions from immunization Requirements. Thank you for your time.
