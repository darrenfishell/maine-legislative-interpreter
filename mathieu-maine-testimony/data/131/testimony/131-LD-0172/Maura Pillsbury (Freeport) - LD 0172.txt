Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services, my name is Maura Pillsbury and I am a resident of Freeport. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony in opposition to the vaccine 
bills before you today.
For some people, Covid is a terrible, devastating, and deadly disease. A member of 
my family was undergoing treatment for cancer, essentially meaning she had no 
immune system. And then she got Covid. We don’t know if it was in the hospital, 
during EMS transport, or from a family member. But she never recovered. Covid 
hastened her death, and made her final days worse. I was unable to be at her bedside 
when she died, after I too was infected because I was caring for her. 
Members of health care professions should be required to be vaccinated to protect 
their patients. Why would we expose vulnerable people to unnecessary risk if we have
another option? Vaccines reduce the incidence and severity of disease. 
We will never know if our loved one would have survived and beat cancer if she 
wasn’t infected with Covid. 
If people want to enter health professions and care for people, like my loved one, I 
implore them to get vaccinated or find another profession. It’s against their oath to do 
no harm to expose a patient to disease if they could possibly prevent it, or reduce the 
likelihood of contracting a disease and passing it on. Patients, and their loved ones, 
deserve better.
I urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on all of these bills. The health and 
safety of vulnerable patients is more important than the personal decision to decline a 
vaccine. Moreover, there are other better options to address health care and EMS 
worker shortages than endangering public health.
Thank you for your time and public service to our state.
