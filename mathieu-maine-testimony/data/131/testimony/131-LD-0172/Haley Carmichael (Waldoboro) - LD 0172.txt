committee. I am unable to submit online via the portal and talked with the secretary whom gave me this email to submit 
to. thank you 
Dear Members of the Health and Human Services Committee, 
l, Haley Carmichael RN, a resident of Waldoboro ask you to pass LD 172 "An act to allow healthcare workers to return to 
work by reinstating exemptions from immunization requirements." lam currently unemployed as a nurse in the state of 
Maine due to LD 798 an act that took our religious and philosophical exemptions away. Pass this bill to allow thousands 
of medical professionals to regain employment, helping to alleviate the healthcare crisis that exists in the state of Maine. 
I live my life with strong beliefs/religious convinctions that withheld me from getting an experimental injection into my 
body because I value and honor my natural body. Please pass this bill to allow me, a nurse with 16+ years experience to 
re-enter my career of choice. Pass LD172 to uphold the constitution and support the unalienable right to religious 
freedom. 
Haley Carmichael 
Waldoboro,ME.
