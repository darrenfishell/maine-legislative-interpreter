Good morning,
After a wonderful run of 33 years of Nursing, majority of which, was here in beautiful
Southern Maine, I was terminated by Mainehealth for my decision to not receive the 
Covid vaccine.  In no way am I an "anti vaxer".  I am fully vaccinated in every other 
way.  Aside from all the craziness that came along with the the pandemic, forcing an 
emergency use order on anyone, especially healthcare workers was, in my opinion, 
quite tragic.  If this was indeed a "clinical trial", it was not overseen as a scientific 
trial would have been. We now know, the vaccines did not stop the spread and though
Healthcare can declare that "maybe it lessened the severity" of the infection, there is 
no hard evidence of this yet.  
Changing careers has been daunting and I miss caring for patients deeply, though the 
establishment of Healthcare, I do not miss so much.  
When you look at the STATE OF MAINE
IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS
Note Section 4, part B:
Proof of Immunity
To demonstrate that an employee is immune to any of the diseases listed in Section 
5(A)(1)-(5), the employee may present the hospital/facility Designated Healthcare 
Facility with laboratory evidence demonstrating immunity, or other acceptable 
evidence 
of immunity. (See Section 7(-B) Individual Health Records.) No Proof of Immunity is
available for COVID-19 or Influenza.
We cannot prove that even with vaccination, there is no proof of immunity for Covid 
or influenza.  Influenza vaccines were thoroughly and scientifically proven to lessen 
the blow of flu.  Not so with Covid vaccines.
I humbly implore you to let us get back to the bedside to care for those we love, 
including our peers who are just as broken working in a flawed system.
(I am unable to zoom or attend on Monday, though wish I was.)
