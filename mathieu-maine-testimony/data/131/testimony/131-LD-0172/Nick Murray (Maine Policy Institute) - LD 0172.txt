Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
172:
“An
Act
to
Allow
Health
Care
Workers
to
Return
to
Work
by
Reinstating
Exemptions
from
Immunization
Requirements”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
172.
The
wave
of
COVID-19
vaccine
mandate
policies
which
swept
the
United
States
in
2021,
whether
on
the
federal,
state,
or
local
level,
were
each
grave
injustices.
Politicians
and
so-called
public
health
experts
coerced
Americans
to
take
brand
new
medical
products,
without
long-term
data
on
safety
or
even
efficacy
against
viral
transmission.
With
these
acts,
they
betrayed
the
public
trust.
They
will
go
down
in
history
as
some
of
the
most
ignorant
and
destructive
domestic
policies
in
decades.
We
understand
that
Representative
Boyer
has
submitted
substitute
bill
language
which
would
simply
strike
COVID-19
from
the
list
of
required
immunizations
for
employees
in
healthcare
settings
under
DHHS
rules.
LD
172
would
restore
the
jobs
of
nurses,
aides,
and
other
administrative,
non-patient-facing
workers
fired
after
Governor
Mills
mandated
that
employees
of
healthcare
systems
take
the
new
vaccines
for
fall
2021.
1
Just
after
Mills’
mandate
went
into
effect,
Central
Maine
Medical
Center
announced
that
it
would
be
cutting
back
services,
even
closing
entire
units.
2
These
issues
persist
today.
Maine
Health
Care
Association,
a
group
which
represents
more
than
200
long
term
care
facilities,
published
a
survey
of
its
membership
in
Spring
2022
which
noted
that
about
41%
are
“very
concerned”
about
their
workforce,
and
44%
report
being
at
“crisis
level”
staffing.
3
This
bill
should
be
a
critical
priority
for
this
Legislature.
The
governor
is
unwilling
to
admit
the
truth:
that
her
mandate
did
nothing
to
affect
COVID-19
transmission.
It
only
weakened
the
state’s
healthcare
system
in
a
time
of
crisis.

As
health
care
systems
across
Maine
continue
to
complain
of
persistent
staffing
shortages,
4
Rep.
Boyer’s
bill
would
help
increase
access
to
care
and
provide
some
downward
pressure
on
health
care
costs
in
Maine
(which
are
already
$1,000
more
than
the
national
average)
by
increasing
the
supply
of
available
providers.
Please
deem
LD
172
“Ought
To
Pass.”
It
is
the
least
that
this
Legislature
or
the
state
government
can
do
to
apologize
to
thousands
of
hard-working
Maine
professionals,
and
attempt
to
right
some
of
the
injustices
of
the
last
few
years.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
