I was employed as a full-time firefighter for the City of Portland and was fired 
because I did not receive the vaccination even though I feel in line with one of the 
cityâ€™s 3 criteria they put forward. Those 3 options were: 1. Proof of vaccination. 2. 
Laboratory proof of immunity. 3. Medical Exemption.
I provided laboratory proof of immunity (Antibody Test) and I went a step further and
provided a T-Cell test that not only proved I had already had covid, but my body was 
able to produce antibodies genetically which is far superior that any vaccination that 
was or has been produced for covid.
After I was terminated (October 8, 2021) the Portland Fire Department which was 
now 100% fully vaccinated (Email sent to the department from the Chief stating that),
the department had more people out with covid after that date than they did any time 
prior to my termination. I was terminated on the 8th of October 2021 and not even 
before the official date the Governor set up for termination 29th October, the 
department had more people out with covid. I was told by city officials as well as the 
Maine EME and CDC that I was a danger to the public which was proven wrong prior
to the 29th of October.
I would like to have my job back as well as all the back pay that is due. I should have 
never been fired and that was well know prior to October 29, 2021.
Thank You
John Cassidy
