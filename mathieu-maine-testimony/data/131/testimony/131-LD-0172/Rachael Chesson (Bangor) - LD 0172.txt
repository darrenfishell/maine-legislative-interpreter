LD 172
Hello,
I am writing a testimony in favor of LD172 to reinstate exemptions for health care 
workers from immunization requirements. I have worked in healthcare all of my adult
life. I worked as a respiratory therapist for 22 years where I was exposed constantly to
contagious infections/diseases. I worked tirelessly during covid taking care of the 
sickest patients. I was good enough then to take care of those patients, but not good 
enough once the mandate went into effect. I had to quit my job because I refuse to be 
subject/forced to put anything that I disagree with into my body. Especially something
so new. Not once while I worked at the hospital did I come down with covid, because 
of the appropriate PPE. That's what we have always used in healthcare including 
during the flu season. We as a state were facing a healthcare shortage prior to covid 
and the mandate made this worse. We went from hero to zero very quickly. Please 
consider passing this.
