I am a nurse practitioner who worked for Maine Health for nearly ten years. At the 
time of my firing in October of 2021 due to refusal to take the Covid vaccine, I was 
working at SMHC Walk In Clinics. I had countless patients come in days and weeks 
post covid vaccine with symptoms that could only be explained by the only new 
variable: the vaccine. Upon further investigation, I learned where the vaccines came 
from: aborted fetuses. The manner in which the vaccines were created is a violation of
my Christian beliefs. Furthermore, forcing a medical treatment upon someone violates
not only my medical and nursing teaching, but also my Christian principles. For those
who would argue that by receiving the vaccine, you are protecting others, the Maine 
CDC data has already showed that the vaccine is ineffective in both spreading and 
preventing the virus. With side effects rates (including miscarriage, cardiac side 
effects, neurological symptoms) higher than any other vaccine in the immunization 
schedule, it is extremely unethical for me to encourage my patients to receive, as well 
as for me to be forced to receive it. It violates my Christian values to set a dangerous 
precedent of medicine by force. In my clinical practice it would be obscene if I tell a 
patient that they must take what I prescribe or I will kick them out of my clinic.  The 
vaccine mandates without religious exemptions is no different. I would love to return 
to work, but as long as the vaccine mandate is in place without allowance for religious
exemptions, I will continue to be forced out of the very short staffed industry.
