LD 172
I am asking the committee to vote in favor of  LD172 and allow healthcare workers to
return to their jobs with acceptance of vaccine exemptions. I worked as a registered 
nurse for 39 years before I was forced to leave my job after my religious exemption 
for the Covid-19 vaccine was denied. I worked through that first year of the 
pandemic, agreeing to the protocols put in place but was deemed unsafe when 
legislation was put in place by our governing body. My love is still in nursing, though
I am not working as an RN at the present time. I worked in a specialty field, Neonatal 
Intensive Care, and had many years of experience in caring for sick neonates and their
families.  I know, from continued communication with my previous co-workers, that 
the ruling to prevent me and others from working in the healthcare field, has put a 
great strain and burden on the healthcare environment. I have been told repeatedly 
how much I am needed. I am asking for your support of LD 172 to help right this 
wrong and bring some relief and much needed experience back to the healthcare 
environments.  Thank you.
