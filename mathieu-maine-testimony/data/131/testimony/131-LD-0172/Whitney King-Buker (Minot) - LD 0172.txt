As a mother, healthcare worker my purpose in life has been to care for our children, 
our community, its citizens.
There are many more men and women like myself that want to help while our State is 
facing defined hardship when it comes to basic healthcare for the people of Maine.
Our State has one of the oldest populaces that have earned the right to quality 
caregiving. Our elders have built a solid foundation for the next generations. We owe 
it to them to give them the care that they deserve.
Quality hospital care is vital to economic growth and prosperity for our State. 
Families are unable to obtain primary care services.
Emergency rooms overflowing.
With the crisis of caregiver burn out and defined need for healthcare, our 
communities need its caregivers now more than ever, and their struggling caregivers 
need their State now more than ever.
Our time is now to expand quality healthcare in our State through harnessing capable 
local workforce. 
Please let us help.
