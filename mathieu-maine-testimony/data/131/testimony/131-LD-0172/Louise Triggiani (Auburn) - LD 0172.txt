Healthcare workers, like myself, deserve to have exemptions reinstated from 
immunization requirements, due to vaccines generally containing numerous 
scientifically proven carcinogens and toxins, including but not limited to aluminum, 
ammonium sulfate, animal cells, antibiotics (made from GMOs), formaldehyde, 
human diploid cells (originating from human aborted fetal tissue), MSG, peanut oil 
#65, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze), squalene and thimerosal (mercury).  
Of most importance to me is the use of aborted human fetal tissue in developing the 
vaccine.  I believe the life of a child is a gift from God and no human has a right to 
deny life.  So using human fetal tissue in this manner is morally unacceptable.     
The reason I became a nurse was not to abuse fellow human beings, but to care for 
them to the best of my ability. Most nurses and people who work in the healthcare 
field do so because of this very caring.   
I was fired from my position of over 24 years as a nurse because of my unwillingness 
to have vaccines injected into my body which go against my strongest beliefs, my 
belief in God.   
So if caring for each other is a trait you would like to continue to see in healthCARE, 
I urge you to not require these very people to change their beliefs in order to stay 
employed.   You may find the people of healthcare becoming the opposite.
