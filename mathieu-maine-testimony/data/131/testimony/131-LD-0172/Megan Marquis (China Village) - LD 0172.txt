LD 172
Dear Health and Human Services Committee,
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to oppose LD 172.
This affects me because I do not feel safe receiving healthcare from a person that isn't 
vaccinated. That alone put's my health at risk, when I'm already trying to receive 
health care. It also makes healthcare even more inaccessible for the 
immuno-compromised.  It also makes me question their competence. It might be an 
"exemption" but it could also mean medical bias (from possible misinformation) that 
prevents the accessibility of vaccines for other patients. The last thing I need from a 
medical professional is someone trying to make me feel afraid about accessing the 
only treatment that would prevent COVID due to their own personal bias, or 
misinformation (Which we still haven't found a way to resolve). The only sure thing 
we can do - is make sure all of our health care professionals are covered with 
appropriate vaccines - which ultimately make healthcare more accessible for all. 
So support LD 172.
