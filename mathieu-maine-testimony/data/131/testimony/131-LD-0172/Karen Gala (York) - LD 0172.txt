LD 172
Good morning,
My name is Karen Gala.I am giving testimony in support of Bill LD172 .The act to 
allow healthcare workers to work by reinstating exemptions from Immunizations 
requirements.
I have been a Registered Nurse since 1983.I was terminated on October 28th 2021 
from my job at York Family Practice / York Hospital for not receiving the Covid 
vaccine .This vaccine was issued under the EUA,and mandated by Governor Mills.I 
was unable to get a Religious exemption .I loved my job,and worked during the Covid
pandemic.I was also unable to claim unemployment benefits during this time due to 
my “ bring terminated”and not complying to the mandate.Since then I have had to live
off savings and my family.I am 61 years old and had worked in hospitals and health 
since I was 19 years old.I wish to work again in the State of Maine.Please pass 
LD172.Thank You
