LD 172
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and all Health and Human Services 
Committee members: My name is Jessie Boda and I'm from Poland. I am testifying in
favor of LD 172.  
I am the director of a Classical Christian hybrid school and I maintain my RN license 
since losing my job to Governor Mills' Covid-19 vaccine mandate in October of 2021.
My journey since then has been unjust and difficult, including being denied 
unemployment. Thankfully, the Lord had better plans for me, and I am at peace with 
my personal situation. However, I am very disturbed that so many intelligent, capable 
healthcare workers continued to be denied employment in Maine hospitals and 
nursing homes because of their vaccine status. 
Entire hospital units have closed, nursing homes have closed and thousands of 
healthcare workers have left the industry (or have decided not to enter it), moved out 
of state or signed on with travel agencies. Maine's loss is their gain.
I am well-informed and well-read. I think outside the box and know how to critically 
think. I don't just believe something because everyone else does. I don't just go along 
with the crowd. And I have deep, abiding convictions rooted in the ultimate wisdom 
of our Lord, Jesus Christ. History tells us those qualities are the making of great 
influential leaders. And, history tells us that those people are often persecuted for their
convictions and "crazy" ideas- only to be lauded later, when the truths they stood for 
are realized and accepted as a great benefit to society. 
Maine has lost me and many other healthcare workers like me because of vaccinate 
mandates and the loss of vaccine exemptions. We are the type of people you want 
working in our great state. We are the type of people you would want caring for 
yourself or your loved ones. I urge you to vote "ought to pass". Thank you.
