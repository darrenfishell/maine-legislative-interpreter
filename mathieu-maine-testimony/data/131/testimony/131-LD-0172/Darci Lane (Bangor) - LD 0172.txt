Hello and thank you for your time today. I know that you have 
all listened to many “emotional” testimonies both today and 
during other hearings.  I too am passionate about this mandate 
however I would rather take this time to focus on some facts 
and hard-core data about this matter.  I think emotion, one of 
them being fear, is what has contributed to this divide. We 
have been told that it is for patient “safety” that we cannot 
allow exemptions to any vaccine. Patient safety and safety of 
care is a much more complex issue. 
Today I would like to share some truths about my experience so 
that you understand some things that are going on due to this 
mandate.  However, I hope your vote is based on facts and the 
data that I present and how this decision is impacting the care 
or lack of care our community is experiencing . Most of my 
resources were gathered from the CDC, AHRQ (Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality) ,Patient Safety Network , and 
the Joint Commission the accrediting Quality body of CMS.  
Truths about me and my experience: I have been practicing as a 
nurse for 26 years, mostly in critical care. Prior to this mandate 
I was able to receive an exemption to the flu shot after having 5 
allergic reactions (so for 5 years this wasn’t an issue), however 
since the mandate I cannot get any provider to write a medical 
exemption and am told that my personal philosophical belief 
will be accepted. Many have stated that we weren’t fired for 
not getting the Covid shot, rather we would not be allowed to 
pick up shifts after October 28, 2021 . So, prior to being unable 
to pick up shifts ,I was doing Nursing Supervisor 24 hours a 
week and teaching Junior level Nursing students at Husson on 
the weekends.  I worked during the pandemic up until Oct 28, 
2021 (22 months from when Covid 19 originated). I caught 
Covid and was told that my natural immunity ( that I caught at 
work) wasn’t going to be accepted. There was no rational give 
just “we have decided not to accept that”.  We now know 
natural immunity is equivalent and in some studies 
superior. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/natural-

Facts about Patient Safety- 
Patient Safety is directly related to nursing ratios. When 
Nursing ratios go up so do errors and sentinel events ( a patient 
safety event that reaches a patient and results in death, 
permanent harm, or severe temporary harm). 
According to the Joint Commission the accrediting Quality body 
of CMS patients are not as safe as they could be in hospitals.  
Root cause analysis shows that communication is 63% , 
orientation and training is 58 % and staffing levels is 18%. When 
there is less staff, orientation and training is fast tracked, travel 
nurses on average get a  3 day orientation and communication 
is hurried when everyone is overloaded.

Some of the other areas that effect patient safety are : 
Medication 
 errors  
• 
The 
 FDA

 more 
 than 
 100,000 
 reports 
 every 
 year 
that 
 are 
associated 
 with 
 medication 
 errors 
 (FDA, 
 2019).  
• 
Forty-one 
 percent 
 of 
Americans 
 report 
 having 
 been 
involved 
 with 
 a 
medical

 either 
 personally 
 or 
secondhand 
 (Institute

 7 
million

impacted 
 by 
medication

about 
 an 
8%-
25% 
 median 
 medication

 rate 
 (Patient

 (Institute

5 
medication 
 doses 
 given 
 during 
 hospital 
 stays 
are 
given 
 in

 (DataRay,

About 
 530,00 
 injuries 
 happen 
 every 
 year 
 in 
outpatient 
clinics 
 because 
 of 
medical 
 errors 
 (HG.org).

Older 
 patients 
 are 
more 
 likely 
 to 
be 
affected 
 by 
a 
medical 
error 
 during 
 medical 
 care 
 because 
 they 
 tend 
 to 
take 
 more 
medications 
 than 
 younger 
 adults 
 (Paul

Perkins,

• 
Every 
 year, 
 7,000-9,000 
 Americans 
 die 
as 
a 
result 
 of 
a 
medication

 (NCBI,

 are 
the 
eighth 
 leading 
 cause 
 of 
death 
 in 
the 
U.S.

 one 
 death 
 every

• 
Medication

 injure 
 more

 1.3 
million 
 people 
every 
 year 
 in

• 
Thirty 
 percent 
 of

 due 
 to 
prescription 
 drugs 
 in 
hospital 
 settings 
 happen 
 because 
 of 
medication 
 errors 
(

The 
 cost 
 of 
medication 
 errors  
• 
The 
 U.S. 
 spends 
 more 
 than 
 $40 
 billion 
 each 
 year 
 on 
patients 
 who 
 have 
 been 
 affected 
 by 
medication 
 errors 
(NCBI, 
 2021).  
• 
Preventable 
 medication

 cost 
 the 
U.S. 
 more 
 than 
 $21 
billion 
 every 
 year 
 across 
 all 
care 
 settings 
 (

 is 
almost 
 1%

Patient falls- according to the CDC falls are the leading cause 
of injury related death in adult over age 65 . Most are 
considered preventable.  For year 2021 Maine’ s data on the 
CDC website showed 128 death rate per 100,000 – we had 325 
deaths . Our state is the 8th highest for fall deaths. 42 other 
states have lower fall mortality than Maine . 
https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/fall-deaths.html  
 
Infections- Health care–associated infections (HAIs) are a 
serious patient safety issue that result in increased morbidity 
and mortality as well as excessive health resource 
utilization .1 Recent estimates from the United States show that 
on any given day approximately 1 of every 25 inpatients in 
acute care hospitals has at least one HAI.2 The Joint 
Commission Journal of Quality and Patient Safety Fifty-four 
articles were included in the review. The majority of studies 
examined the relationship between nurse staffing and HAIs 
(n = 50, 92.6%) and found nurse staffing variables to be 
associated with an increase in HAI rates (n = 40, 74.1%).  
Conclusion 
Increased staffing is related to decreased risk of acquiring HAIs

Pressure injuries-( see Handout ) 2.5 million cases per year, 
Second most common diagnosis in health system billing records 
in the U.S.  60,000 deaths per year, Would make it the 8th most 
frequent cause of death in U.S. based on CDC reporting . 
Increased rate by 6% since 2014 U.S. AHRQ reports an 
increased pressure injury rate between 2014-2017; it is the only 
hospital-acquired condition rate currently increasing rather 
than improving nationwide.

Many health professionals have left the field or plan on leaving 
, 18 percent seems to be the most consistent number ( 1:5 
approximately) .   We have a shortage of RNs across the World 
and I do not understand why we are preventing qualified 
people from working under the guise of “ it’s for patient safety 
when clearly it is not’

Patient 
 Safety 
 is 
much 
 more 
 complex 
 than 
 I 
can 
get 
into 
 in 
3 
min 
 however 
 in 
every 
 study 
 shown 
 here, 
 better 
 nursing 
 ratios 
directly 
 impact 
 these 
 outcomes. 
 Better 
 nursing 
 ratios= 
 better, 
 “ 
safer” 
 care 
 . 
Not 
 allowing 
 nurses 
 to 
work 
 because 
 they 
 have 
 an 
allergy 
 or 
because 
 they 
 have 
 a 
personal 
 objection 
 is 
not 
what 
 is 
causing 
 “unsafe 
 “ 
health 
 care. 
 
The 
 least 
 safe 
 care 
 is 
the 
care 
 you 
 don’t 
 receive 
 or 
the 
care 
 you 
receive 
 too 
late. 
 
Thank 
 you 
 for 
your
