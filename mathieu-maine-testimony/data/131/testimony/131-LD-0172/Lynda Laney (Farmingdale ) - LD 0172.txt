To whom it may concern, 
I am a Registered Nurse since 2003.
I turned 60 in 2020. My plan was to continue doing a job I loved! So proud & 
honored  to care for our hero's I call them. All the Veterans who served our great 
Country!
Never did I imagine in a million years I would be asked to quit my job because I 
CHOSE what goes into my already healthy body.
I haven't had a flu shot in several years, again my choice.
Witnessed several friends family members who got the experiment & got Covid not 
once but twice.
I have a family member whose wife almost died in a local hospital after being put on 
a ventilator!
So being very healthy myself rarely sick ever. Who am I a threat too??
This is unconstitutional in so many ways .It's all about the money. Jabs jabs jabs 
profits in Politicians MDs pockets! So the good doctors who try to prevent illness 
with exercise diet vitamins get shot down because they don't follow the agenda. And 
don't get me started with masks on CHILDREN! 
ME was one of the first to place mandates on Healthcare workers. It made me so 
angry when I had to tell family members to come to a window to visit their Mom Dad
grandparent etc. The truth is out there. The vaccine (experiment) is NOT effective. 
Period! Carry on Patriots, We the people will NOT give up our rights!
I would love to have my job back, as living off my husband's retirement has taken a 
toll on us financially. I never got or applied for unemployment as I was told to quit. In
which I never verbally stated that. It was their words. 
Sincerely, Lynda L RN
