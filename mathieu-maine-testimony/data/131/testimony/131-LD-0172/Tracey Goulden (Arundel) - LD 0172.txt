My name is Tracey Goulden of Arundel, Maine.  I was a healthcare worker for over 
25 years. I left my job due to the unconstitutional and experimental covid vaccine. 
Not only did I loose my job I couldn't collect unemployment to help my families 
financial commitments. Finding employment that gave me comparable pay took over 
a year! The forcing of healthcare workers into taking a shot or loose a job at a time 
when we could not afford to loose healthcare workers was mind-boggling. I am not 
anti-vaccine. Let's face it this vaccine was not tested for any amount of time. It still 
hasn't been proven to be 100% safe or effective since the rollout. Are we going to just 
continue to go along with this mandate for the sake of going along? Or are we going 
to finally come to our senses and admit this was never a good idea?  At least let it be 
proven to be safe and effective prior to forcing it upon an already struggling industry. 
Hiring temporary workers from out of state for triple the pay is not the answer. Put us 
back to work!  Hospitals, clinics, and rehabs all over the state need us! Now is the 
time to say enough is enough!
