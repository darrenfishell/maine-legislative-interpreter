I,am one of many health care workers in the state of Maine that was displaced from 
my job in October 2021. I worked as a CNA for 8 years at MaineGeneral. Not only 
was I displaced from my work but I lost income for my family of 4! Reinstating the 
right for religious exemptions is so important not just for myself but many others 
displaced from their jobs and for the current staff working understaffed.
