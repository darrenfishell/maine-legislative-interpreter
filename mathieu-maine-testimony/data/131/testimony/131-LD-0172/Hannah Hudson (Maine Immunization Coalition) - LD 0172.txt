Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services  
Testimony of Hannah A. Hudson on behalf of Maine Immunization Coalition  
April 24, 2023  
 
In Opposition To:  
LD 172, An Act to Allow Health Care Workers to Return to Work by Reinstating 
Exemptions from Immunization Requirements  
Sponsored By: Representative Boyer  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health and Human Services , I am Hannah Hudson, a member of the Maine 
Immunization Coalition (MIC) and the Policy and Communications Manager at Maine 
Primary Care Association (MPCA). MPCA serves as the administrative home of the MIC.  
 
The MIC is a network of associations, health ca re systems, and providers working to 
protect Maine people across their lifespan against vaccine -preventable diseases, by 
increasing immunization rates through information sharing and collaboration. As a 
statewide group, we undertake collaborative advocacy on immunization. Our efforts 
promote evidence -based policies that result in improved immunization rates for 
children and adults in the State of Maine.  
 
We are opposed to LD 172 and the other bills being heard by the committee today 
related to COVID -19 vac cine mandates.  Maintaining i mmunization requirements for  
employees of designated health care facilities to reduce the risk of exposure to, and 
possible transmission of, vaccine -preventable diseases  is not new . The addition of the 
COVID -19 vaccine to the rules was done to protect Maine people, limit the spread o f the 
virus, and maintain our health care system.  
 
Covid -19 is a serious disease . Contracting it can cause pneumonia ,1 chronic fatigue2, 
injury to organs3, acute respiratory distress syndrome4, septic shock5, blood clots6, and 
death7. Patients have a right to be treated in a safe environment, as do staff working at 
health care facilities, especially those with medical conditions that put them at 
increased risk of harm in the event of an outbreak of disease.  
 
On behalf of the Maine Immu nization Coalition, we urge you to oppose this bill. Please 
do not hesitate to contact me directly at hhudson@mepca.org  if I can answer any 
questions.
