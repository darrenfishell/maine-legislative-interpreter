Vaccination is a vital public health issue, and we support vaccination requirements based on public health and medical best practices for the benefit of all Mainers. Therefore, we strongly urge you to reject this reckless and harmful bill.   American Atheists is a national civil rights organization that works to achieve religious equality for all Americans by protecting what Thomas Jefferson called the “wall of separation” between government and religion created by the First Amendment. We strive to create an environment where atheism and atheists are accepted as members of our nation’s communities and where casual bigotry against our community is seen as abhorrent and unacceptable. We promote understanding of atheists through education, outreach, and community-building and work to end the stigma associated with being an atheist in America. As advocates for the health, safety, and well-being of all Americans, American Atheists objects to efforts to subordinate medical care to the religious beliefs of providers and institutions.   LD 172 would increase the number of vaccination exemptions which allow employees to summarily waive the vaccination requirements. Public health experts believe that no exception should be made to neutral immunization requirements intended to protect public health. Specifically, non-essential exemptions to immunization requirements endanger all in order to accommodate the religious or philosophical beliefs of a few. Such exemptions are unacceptable from both a public health and moral perspective. Successful population immunity to disease depends upon a significant level of vaccination, as high as 95% for some diseases.1 Because  1 Salathe, Marcel. (Feb. 3, 2015).

Creating a loophole in Maine’s vaccination requirements will put all at risk, more specifically children. Children are at significant risk for contracting debilitating and potentially deadly infectious diseases. Children exempt from immunization requirements are more than 35 times more likely to contract measles2 and nearly 6 times more likely to contract pertussis (whooping cough),3 compared to immunized children. According to the CDC, the opt-out rate for vaccination in Maine is 5.3%, which is more than double the national average of 2.2%.4 Tragically, this difference is responsible for a public health epidemic: Maine has one of the highest rates of pertussis in the country and skyrocketing rates of chickenpox.5   History illustrates that outbreaks often occur in communities that are unsupportive of vaccination. For example, measles is a vaccine-preventable disease that has plagued multiple religious communities known to be either hesitant to vaccinate or completely against vaccination.6 However, lawmakers have a responsibility to protect all, regardless of their religion or lack thereof. No person should be subject to harm or illness based on the religious beliefs of their employees.  Furthermore, the rights of employees to request reasonable accommodations on the basis of their beliefs are already protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act7.  Under Title VII, an employer must offer a reasonable accommodation for an employee’s sincerely held religious belief unless an accommodation would impose an “undue hardship” on the employer.8 LD 172 would set a different standard leading to confusion and challenges in compliance for public employers and schools. After decades of experience providing accommodations under Title VII, public entities will be burdened with a new standard.    2 Salmon DA, Haber M, Gangarosa EJ, Phillips L, Smith NJ, Chen RT.

A number of states, including California, Mississippi, and West Virginia do not allow for these types of religious exemptions. As the US Supreme Court has made clear, “The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or child communicable disease, or the latter to ill health or death…. Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves.”9  We strongly urge you to reject ME LD 172 to protect Maine.
