Good morning,I am a nurse and lost my job,last year for not taking the shot..I am a 
Christian and tried to get a religious excemption,and was told no.I had Bellspalsy,as a 
baby and that was one of the side effects and was told no.I had nature immunity was 
confirmed twice with blood test and was told no..I was told yountake the shot or lose 
your job...Well as I said in the beginning I lose my job.I hope and pray that this 
committee will vote in favor of this bill..There are hundreds of people just like me 
that lost there jobs...Thankyou for taking the time to read my testimony..
