Pamela Vose
Union
LD 172
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.   I am writing in 
opposition to LD 172.   
Healthcare workers should never be exempted from vaccinations which help to 
protect us all.   They are in a position to do much harm to vulnerable populations if 
this were allowed.   
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on this misguided politically motivated bill.
