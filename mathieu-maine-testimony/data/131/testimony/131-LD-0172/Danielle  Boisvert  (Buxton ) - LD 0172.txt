Hi
 My name is Danielle. I’m 33yo. I have worked as a medical assistant since 2008. I 
had my son in 2019 as the pandemic was starting. I stayed home with my son for a 
year due to postpartum. When my mental health was better and I was able to find 
child care I was excited to get back to work and continue doing what I love. I was told
I could not return unless I was vaccinated against COVID 19. Healthcare was in a 
crisis and a shortage of workers across the U.S due to this pandemic. I was shocked 
that even with all the PPE that was required of everyone that a vaccine that was still 
so new could be pushed on healthcare workers. Saying “you must get a vaccine to 
work” put me in a tough situation. Do u get this vaccine and risk my health not 
knowing long term side effects? I had to make the tough decisions to not get it. I 
wanted so badly to go back to healthcare and work. My family suffered from me not 
working and so did my mental health. Here we are 2023 still mandating this vaccine 
even though we have seen first hand the horrible side effects from this. I want to get 
back to work, I want to support my family, I want to help others, I want to have better
mental health, I don’t want to be forced to get a vaccine. Please lift this vaccine 
mandate and get health care workers back to work.
