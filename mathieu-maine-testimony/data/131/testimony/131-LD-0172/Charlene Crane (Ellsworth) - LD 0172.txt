LD 172
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished Members of the 
Health and Human Services Committee,
My name is Charlene Crane and I am testifying in support of the passage of LD 172. 
While as an independent health practitioner not affiliated with any hospital or medical
clinic I personally was not subjected to the Faustian bargain that the large majority of 
Maine’s hospital and medical clinic health care workers and ambulance drivers were, 
I have profound sympathy for the nurses, doctors and EMS workers who were 
coerced through mandates that required for them to take the experimental and 
unproven Covid-19 mRNA shots or voluntarily lose their jobs. As a thirty-five years 
practicing LMT, who throughout the harrowing months of March to August of 2020 
experienced state quarantine enforced unemployment while receiving no 
compensation of any type (no state or federal Covid-19 pandemic payments), I get 
what it means to be suddenly cut off from a livelihood one is passionate and dedicated
to and to be denied access to an income that has been one’s sole source of monetary 
support for decades. It seems mighty silly to prevent people who want to work in their
jobs and who are sorely needed in those jobs from returning to them based on 
outdated belief and hypocritical dogma that insists that the Covid-19 shots are safe 
and effective*, that there’s no possible other preventatives** and that the therapeutics 
that have been available all along (even in early 2020 but whose use was suppressed 
by blatant censorship by government bad actors, Big Tech and Big Pharma) are not 
recognized as advantageous*** and beneficial.
 Where there is risk**** there must be choice. Health care workers in Maine were not
given a choice during the rollout of one of the most detrimental***** injections ever 
unleashed on the public.  Being that these drugs do not stop transmission or infection, 
that there have been multiple breakthrough cases****** (aka “vaccine failure” 
incidents) documented, that there is no proof of prevention of illness, nor boost in 
one’s immunity that can be attributed and that there is more harm than good that 
comes by coercing******* people to go against their will, the program needs to stop.
The medical authorities testifying in opposition here would have you believe there is 
no risk. But is that really true? I submit to you that it is far from true. It is well worth 
looking into the reasons why. 
Sincerely,
Charlene Crane, LMT
* From an April 20, 2021 publication in The Lancet: 
“Although attention has focused on vaccine efficacy and comparing the reduction of 
the number of symptomatic cases, fully understanding the efficacy and effectiveness 
of vaccines is less straightforward than it might seem. Depending on how the effect 
size is expressed, a quite different picture might emerge…”

*******We should not force COVID vaccines on anyone when the evidence shows 
that naturally acquired immunity is equal to or more robust and superior to existing 
vaccines. Instead, we should respect the right of the bodily integrity of individuals to 
decide for themselves. 
Public health officials and the medical establishment with the help of the politicized 
media are misleading the public with assertions that the COVID-19 shots provide 
greater protection than natural immunity
