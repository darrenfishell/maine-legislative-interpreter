LD 172
Dear Members of the HHS Committee,  
I am writing in reference to ~ LD 172: "An Act to Allow Health Care Workers to 
Return to Work by Reinstating Exemptions from Immunization Requirements"
 
Isn't it time for the charade to end! Facts are out and it's proven there has been no 
efficacy to the Cov.19 shots, and in fact studies have shown the extreme danger of 
having had them. Please do the research and find the stats. 
 People have lost their livelihoods because of it, and so many are now suffering, due 
to lack of health care providers.  Not only were our Maine Constitution First 
Amendment rights violated by the mandate but also the third, i.e. religious freedom.  
(No religious exemptions) 
It is outrageous how long this disaster has gone on, and it seems that there are those 
who would wish to destroy our lives, our State's economy, and for what reason?  
Could it be to gain Federal resources to booster a lack of budget keeping? 
The lies need to stop NOW!  Please make the right decision for the people of Maine!
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD 172: "An Act to Allow Health Care Workers to 
Return to Work by Reinstating Exemptions from Immunization Requirements"
