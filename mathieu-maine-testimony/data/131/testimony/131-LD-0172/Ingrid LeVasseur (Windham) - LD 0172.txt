LD 172
Dear Health and Human Services Committee,
I respectfully request that you vote 'ought to pass' on LD 172, An Act to Allow Health
Care Workers to Return to Work by Reinstating Exemptions from Immunization 
Requirements. 
It never made sense to remove workers from health care particularly since they 
worked for nearly a year prior to the availability of the mRNA Covid vaccines.  The 
state had a shortage of health care workers before the pandemic and now they are 
even more short-staffed.  Out of state workers are brought in to offset the shortfall in 
local staff. Funnily enough, the out of state workers are not required to take the 
vaccine and are costing the hospitals much more than they would have paid the 
regular employees.
How does any of this make any sense? How is this serving the public need for health 
care? The answers are: it doesn't make any sense and the public interest is not being 
served. 
You have a chance to correct these errors in judgment by voting "Ought to Pass" on 
LD 172.
Thank you for your time and service to the State of Maine,
Ingrid LeVasseur
