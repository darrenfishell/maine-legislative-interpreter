Before the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
May 10, 2023 
A 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Energy, Utilities and Technology: 
IECG respectfully offers testimony in opposition to LD 327, An Act to Provide Maine Ratepayers 
with Equitable Access to Interconnection of Distributed Energy Resources. 
The Legislation is well intended. However, the Bill proposes a dramatic change in Maine utility 
regulation that requires careful thought. Here are just a few of the issues: 
0 The Bill would be most impoitant to the projects which voluntarily have chosen the most 
difﬁcult and expensive projects or locations to interconnect with the grid. There are 
approximately 400 Mw of NEB projects tied up in cluster studies to which this legislation 
would be most attractive. These projects would suffer no penalty for their decisions to 
locate in a difficult place. 
0 The Bill proposes to give subsidies in unlimited amounts to the interconnection of one 
speciﬁc technology — solar — with no standards or principles. This could, and likely 
would, add millions to ratepayer costs. 
0 The Bill potentially would subsidize interconnection costs, including legal fees, of NEB 
projects, which already are charging ratepayers four to ﬁve times the cost of 
competitively procured solar, now more than 20 cents/ kWh. These are the last energy 
projects on earth needing another subsidy.

Q The funding of the ombudsman is highly inappropriate. This would allow the solar 
industry to fund the ombudsman. This is surely unintended. Private sector funding should 
not be allowed. 
We would be pleased to answer any questions.
