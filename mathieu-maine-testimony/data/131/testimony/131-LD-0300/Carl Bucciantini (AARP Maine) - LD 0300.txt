I	am	Carl	Bucciantini,	I	live	in	Greene	and	I	am	the	Volunteer	State	President	for	AARP	Maine.	Today	I	am	testifying	in	favor	of	LD	300:	An	Act	to	Establish	Pilot	Initiatives	to	Promote,	Grow	and	Sustain	Adult	Day	Care	and	Respite	Programs	in	Maine		AARP	is	the	nation’s	largest	nonproQit,	nonpartisan	organization	dedicated	to	empowering	Americans	50	and	older	to	choose	how	they	live	as	they	age.	On	behalf	of	our	more	than	200,000	members	statewide,	thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to	share	this	testimony	with	you	today.	Adult	day	care	programs	can	provide	caregivers	with	a	needed	break	while	giving	older	people	a	chance	to	socialize	with	their	peers	and	alleviate	the	isolation	and	loneliness	that	many	experience.	AARP’s	recently	published	Valuing	the	Invaluable	report	found	that	166,000	Mainers	provide	unpaid	care	for	a	loved	one.	These	unpaid	family	caregivers	provide	nearly	155	million	hours	of	care	that	is	valued	at	an	estimated	2.9	billion	dollars.		1Family	caregivers	are	truly	the	backbone	of	our	long-term	care	system.	They	do	this	work	often	without	thanks	and	with	great	stress.	On	top	of	the	stressors	associated	with	being	a	caregiver,	there	is	added	stress	for	those	who	work	on	top	of	their	caregiving	responsibilities.	In	fact,	4	in	10	employed	caregivers	(38	percent)	consider	their	caregiving	situation	to	be	highly	stressful,	while	1	in	4	(27	percent)	say	their	caregiving	experience	is	moderately	stressful	emotionally.	2These	caregivers	willingly	take	on	this	work	for	their	loved	ones,	often	putting	their	own	needs	aside.	Access	to	respite	is	critical	if	we	are	to	support	Maine’s	166,000	family	caregivers.	This	can	allow	them	to	care	for	themselves,	to	avoid	caregiver	burnout,	or	their	own	negative	health	consequences.			Reinhard,	Susan	C.,	Selena	Caldera,	Ari	Houser,	and	Rita	B.	Choula.

Access	to	adult	day	is	beneQicial	for	the	care	recipient	as	well.	According	to	a	2017	review	there	are	many	positive	outcomes	for	those	who	use	Adult	Day	Centers	including	positive	health,	social,	psychological	and	behavior	outcomes.	Further,	AARP’s	Home	and	Community	3Preferences	Survey	reports	that	77%	of	adults	50	and	older	want	to	remain	in	their	homes	for	the	long	term.	Many	in	need	of	care	do	not	wish	to	leave	their	homes	or	their	4communities.	Family	caregivers	are	the	ones	who	facilitate	this	home	and	community	based	care,	in	support	of	their	loved	ones	desire	to	remain	at	home.		LD	300	will	better	support	Maine’s	unpaid	family	caregivers	and	those	they	care	for	by	implementing	pilot	initiatives	to	promote,	grow	and	sustain	the	State's	adult	day	care	and	respite	programs.	Thank	you	for	the	opportunity	to	testify.	If	you	have	questions	for	you	can	connect	with	AARP	Associate	State	Director	Bridget	Quinn	at	bquinn@aarp.org	or	at	:	207-272-8563.
