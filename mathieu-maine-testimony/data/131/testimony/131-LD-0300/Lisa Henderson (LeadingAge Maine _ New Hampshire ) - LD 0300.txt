LD 300
Home and community-based services (HCBS) providers are at an inflection point, and
adult day services providers, in particular, are at risk. During the pandemic, many 
adult day centers closed either by mandate or voluntarily, and many saw most of their 
revenue streams evaporate overnight. Those that have since reopened have done so at 
reduced capacity and with fewer participants attending. This has led to centers 
closing, jeopardizing the availability of these services over the long run. 
A pilot program would enable proof of concept of other funding models to sustain this
vital service for older adults. 
LeadingAge Maine & New Hampshire is in full support of LD 300.
