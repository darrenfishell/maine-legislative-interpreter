Re: Testimony of The Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine In Opposition To LD 524, An Act 
Requiring The Installation Of Electric Vehicle Charger-Ready Spaces In New Commercial And Multifamily 
Parking Lot Construction 
 
On behalf of the Retail Lumber Dealers Association of Maine (RLDAM), which represents independent lumber 
and building material dealers, manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and other associated businesses in the 
state of Maine and an industry that employs more than 20,000 Maine residents, we ask you to oppose LD524 
which mandates the installation of electric vehicle charger-ready spaces. 
 
The RLDAM is not opposed to electric vehicles or charging stations. However, mandates that will place a 
significant cost on Maine small businesses is the wrong approach. Charging an electric vehicle is not like filling 
up a car with gas. Even the fast chargers can take 15-20 minutes and you only get a 60-80% charge, so the 
location of these chargers needs to be more deliberate instead of trying to force their installation everywhere.  
 
This bill would not only impact large retailers, like malls or the “big box” stores of the world, because the 
threshold of 25 or more parking spaces is essentially every small business who has parking, with few 
exceptions. And the cost of these chargers is upwards of $100,000 each, a large amount of money that most 
small businesses in our state do not have lying around to meet this mandate. 
 
The RLDAM believes incentives are the better approach, and we would enjoy the opportunity to work with the 
sponsor and others to develop a solution to the ever-growing need for more electric vehicle charging stations as 
more Mainers go electric with their vehicles. MEMO OF OPPOSITION
