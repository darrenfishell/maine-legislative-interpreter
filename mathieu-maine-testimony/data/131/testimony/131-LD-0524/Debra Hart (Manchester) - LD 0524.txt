Re: LD 524, An Act Requiring the Installation of Electric Vehicle Charger- 
ready spaces in New Commercial and Multfamily Parking Lot Construction 
My name if Debra Hart and I am a resident of Manchester, Maine. I am 
providing these comments in opposition to LD 524 on behalf of my client, the 
Vacation Rental Property Owners of Maine (VRPOM). 
The members of VRPOM manage rental properties all across the State and 
though the majority of the rentals are single family units, there are a number 
that have multi-family dwellings or 2 dwelling units on the same property for 
rent. We believe these vacation rental properties would also fall under 
‘lodging facilities ’ , which would require a at lease 10% of the parking be 
charger-ready spaces. Specifically, in the northern and western part of the 
State, there are sporting camps which have more than 2 dwelling units that 
are all rented and are lodging facilities by definition, as well as more 
traditional vacation rentals that may include a main lodging facility with. 
additional buildings on the property, such as cabins, that are also rented. 
Although, some owners of rental properties ‘may’ elect to install a charger- 
ready space for their guests, requiring charger-ready spaces for many of these 
rental properties seems an excessive expense and an overly burdensome 
requirement. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions 
you may have.
