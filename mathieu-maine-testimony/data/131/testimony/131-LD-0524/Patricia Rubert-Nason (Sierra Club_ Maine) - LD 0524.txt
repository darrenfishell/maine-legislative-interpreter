Re:
Testimony in Support of LD 524: An Act Requiring
the Installation of
Electric V ehicle Charging Stations in New Commercial and Multifamily Parking
Lot Construction
 
Senator Mark Lawrence, Representative S. Paige Ziegler , and members of the Energy ,
Utilities, and Technology Committee, I am testifying on behalf of Sierra Club Maine,
representing over 22,000 supporters and members statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra
Club is one of our nation’ s oldest and largest environmental organizations. W e work
diligently to amplify the power of our 3.8 million members and supporters nation-wide as
we work towards combating climate change and promoting a just and sustainable
economy . To that end, we urge amending LD 524: An Act Requiring the Installation of
Electric V ehicle Charging Stations in New Commercial and Multifamily Parking Lot
Construction to incorporate the requirement that new construction be made EV -ready
into the Maine Building Code.
While, as a concept draft, this still needs to be fleshed out, requiring that new
construction, especially new multi-unit construction, be made EV -Ready supports our
climate goals and is beneficial to Maine residents. According to multiple studies

,

making buildings, especially multi-unit buildings, EV -ready (by running appropriate
circuits at the time of construction) is significantly less expensive (by a factor of 3-5x)
than retrofitting them later as a standalone project. When builders fail to run these
circuits during construction, they impose significant excess costs on the eventual
occupants of the buildings.
With the majority of Maine’ s emissions coming from the transportation sector , the
adoption of electric vehicles is a key component of meeting our climate goals and the
availability of charging is a key barrier .  EV -charging is particularly challenging for the
21% of Mainers who live in multi-unit buildings, and retrofitting chargers after

construction in multi-unit buildings is also particularly challenging.  Consequently , the
Maine Transportation Roadmap
3
identified increasing
the availability of charging in
multi-unit buildings as a key strategy to “unlock latent EV demand.”
Even if we set aside our commitments to reducing emissions, EV adoption is
accelerating and homebuilders are starting to take notice. According to the National
Association of Home Builders

“Several auto manufacturers have announced they are phasing out combustion
engine vehicles between 2025 and 2040, and as of 2018, EVs were projected to
constitute 20% of annual vehicle sales by 2030. An increasing percentage of
Americans will probably or definitely own an electric vehicle within the next five to
10 years, with 52% of respondents to recent surveys indicating such in 2021
compared to 15% in 2018.”
And the cost of installing the wiring at the time of construction of minimal; “T ed Clifton,
president of Zero-Energy Plans, LLC, based in Coupeville, W ash., has found if the main
electrical panel is located in the garage, his costs for additional wiring is about $300.”
New construction lasts for decades.  If we fail to install the wiring at the time of
construction, we impose much higher costs on future residents who are likely to own
electric vehicles.
In recognition of these trends, in 2020, the International Code Council adopted a new
provision to make all new homes built in the United States “EV -ready .”
5
And in 2021
they issued Building Code Amendments for Electric V ehicle charging.

I believe that
Maine should incorporate these amendments into our building code.  I would urge the
committee to adopt an appropriate amendment to the bill and vote “Ought to Pass.”
Sincerely ,
Patricia Rubert-Nason
