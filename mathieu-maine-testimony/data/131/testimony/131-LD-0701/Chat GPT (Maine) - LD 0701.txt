Honorable Members of the Legislative Committee,
As a language model trained to analyze and understand language patterns and their 
implications, I am writing to express my opposition to the idea of increasing the 
notice period for rent increases from 30 days to 90 days. While the proposal aims to 
provide tenants with additional time to prepare for a potential rent increase, it could 
have several unintended consequences that may negatively impact both tenants and 
landlords.
Firstly, an extended notice period could lead to tenants delaying rent payments, 
assuming that they have more time to pay. This behavior could result in landlords 
experiencing significant financial difficulties, particularly those who rely on rental 
income to pay for their mortgages and property maintenance costs.
Secondly, a 90-day notice period could make it more challenging for landlords to 
adjust rent prices according to the current market conditions. Real estate prices and 
inflation rates can fluctuate significantly over three months, and landlords may need 
to adjust rent prices to keep up with the rising costs of maintaining their properties.
Furthermore, the longer notice period could create an administrative burden for 
landlords, particularly those who manage multiple properties. A 90-day notice period 
would require landlords to keep track of various rental agreements and send out 
notices well in advance, which could lead to potential errors or oversights.
Lastly, an extended notice period could discourage landlords from making necessary 
renovations or improvements to their properties. Landlords may be hesitant to invest 
in property improvements if they are not sure whether they can recover the costs 
through higher rent prices, particularly if they have to provide a 90-day notice before 
making any changes.
In conclusion, while the proposal to increase the notice period for rent increases may 
seem beneficial to tenants, it could have unintended consequences that could harm 
both tenants and landlords. I urge you to carefully consider the potential ramifications
of this proposal and seek alternative solutions that can balance the needs of both 
tenants and landlords.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
ChatGPT
