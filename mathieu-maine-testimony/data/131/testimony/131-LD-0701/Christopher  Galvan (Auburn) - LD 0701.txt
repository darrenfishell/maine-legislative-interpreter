Testimony in  OPPOSITION to LD 701: An Act to Increase the Notice Period for Rent Increases
To the Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary:
Paola and I are a working couple that purchased our first multi-unit in August 2022. Paola works full-time as a 
teacher, and I work part-time as an emergency department technician while attending school full-time. 
We are asking you to oppose LD 701: An Act to Increase the Notice Period for Rent Increases. 
Our rental income must at least cover the costs and protection from the liability of owning our property. 
Unfortunately, a 90-day notice is not provided to us when oil, gas, and electricity prices increase overnight. 
Additionally, a tenant who decides not to accept a rent increase will immediately provide a notice to move out. 
Unfortunately, most tenants REFUSE to pay their owed rent before leaving. We are limited in what we can 
require for move-in costs- current law would not cover 90 days of rent and potential damages. Should this bill 
pass, we will refuse to negotiate lower move-in prices, lower monthly rents, spend less on unnecessary 
improvements, and likely remove our property from the business. These measures will be taken to meet our 
expenses and potential expenses that arise. Lastly, there is a significant concern that a 90-day notice may 
significantly delay the purchase and sale of all property by extending closing dates, lowering the value, and 
encouraging corporate ownership with deep pockets of our rental stock.  
We urge you to oppose LD 701.
Best regards,
Christopher Galvan and Paola Santivanez
