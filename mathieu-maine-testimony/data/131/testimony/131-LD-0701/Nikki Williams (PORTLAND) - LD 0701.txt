Nikki Williams
PORTLAND
LD 701
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Judiciary Committee: my name is Nikki Williams, I am a resident of 
Portland and I am submitting testimony in favor of LD 701.
In this housing market, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find housing in 
Maine within 45 days. Not giving tenants adequate notice of rent increases makes it 
even harder for people to maintain their existing housing or find a new home. This is 
why it is important to increase the notice period for rent increases. This is not an 
onerous burden on landlords. 
Thanks so much for your time,
Nikki
