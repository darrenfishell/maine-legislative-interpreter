 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly on  
 LD 701, “An Act to Increase the Notice Period for Rent Increases” 
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Carney ,  Representative   Moonen   and  distinguished   members   of  the  Joint  
 Standing   Committee   on  Judiciary .  My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I  represent   House   District  
 127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  sharing   testimony   in  support   of  LD  701,  An  Act  to 
 Increase the Notice Period for Rent Incr eases   . 
 The  housing   crisis   is  one  of  the  most   pressing   issues   facing   our  state.   My  district   is  one  of  the 
 more   urban   districts   in  the  state,   with  many   of  my  constituents,   including   myself,   being   renters.  
 A  little  over  a  month   is  not  enough   time  for  renters   to  be  able  to  plan  for  rent  increases,   negotiate  
 with  their  landlord,   or  look  for  housing   in  an  already   tight,   expensive,   and  competitive   market.  
 Expanding   it  to  a  90-day   notice   for  rent  increases   will  give  renters   more   time  and  flexibility .  This 
 is a simple but helpful piece of legislation that will aid renters across the state.  
 I  urge  the  Judiciary   Committee   to  vote  ought   to  pass  for  LD  701  .  Thank   you  very  much   for  your 
 time and consideration.
