LD 701
LD 701, "An Act to Increase the Notice Period for Rent Increases", increases the 
notice period for rent increases to 90 days.
A rent increase notice of 45 days is often considered long enough for the following 
reasons:
Financial Planning: A 45-day notice gives tenants adequate time to adjust their budget
and plan for a rent increase. Tenants can review their finances and make necessary 
changes to accommodate the rent increase.
Tenant/Landlord Relationship: A 45-day notice can help maintain a positive 
tenant/landlord relationship. Tenants are more likely to feel that their landlord is being
fair and reasonable, which can lead to better communication and a more positive 
living experience.
The 45 Day notice has been in effect for years and works well, Making it longer is not
needed or necessary.
