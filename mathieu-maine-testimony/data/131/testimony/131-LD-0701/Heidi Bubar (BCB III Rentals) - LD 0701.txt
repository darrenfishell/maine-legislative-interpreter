BCB III Rentals
LD 701
I oppose LD 701.  Landlords could argue that a longer notice period could make it 
more difficult for them to manage their properties effectively and make necessary 
adjustments to rent levels in a timely manner. Landlords could also argue that the 
ability to increase rent is necessary to cover maintenance costs and ensure a fair return
on investment.
