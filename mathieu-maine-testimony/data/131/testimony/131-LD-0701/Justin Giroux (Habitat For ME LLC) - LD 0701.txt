RE: LD 701  
Dear Members of the Judiciary  Committee ,  
I’m oppo sed to LD 7 01. I believe the current 45 days’ notice  is sufficient  to give proper notice about rent 
increases.  
I’d remind you that most  of the pri ce increases in rental  housing  were  due to poor Federal monetary  
policy and the public health crises . That caused rampant  inflation in everythin g. The price of buying  
houses  and rental houses increased . In fact, our cost to buy small multifa mily home s in Waterville 
increased at least 2x since the pandemic , which obviously  put upward pressure on re nts.   
Since the Fed has increased interest rates, you have seen the housing market slow down. S lowly , but 
surely this is also starting to cause  rents to slow, flatline or decrease depending on which national 
market you are looking at. This trend is also occurring  locally here in Maine.   
I’d argue  that the  market is taking care of the problem you are t rying to solve  as rents are stabilizing . 
There is no need for additional regulation  on rent increases.  
I ask the member of the legislature  to stop the atta cks on the rental housing pr oviders of Maine. I ’d 
remind you that most of  us are s mall mom and pop providers.  We are you r neighbors  and we try to do 
well by our community  and our tenants .
