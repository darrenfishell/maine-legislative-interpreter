Chair Rafferty, Chair Brennan, Members of the Committee on Education and Cultural
Affairs:
My name is Tobin Williamson and I am the Advocacy Manager for the Maine 
Immigrants' Rights Coalition. I regret that my travels for a work conference prohibit 
me from joining you in the Public Hearing today.
I am writing in strong support of LD 1702 - Resolve, to Establish the Commission to 
Improve the Educational Experience of People Who Are Resettling in Maine.
Whenever significant communities of new arrivals settle in a town, one of the first 
things we hear about is the impact it has / will have on the local schools. Our 
educators are heroic, but many Maine schools are understaffed, underpaid, and 
overworked. Additionally, many are not trained or equipped with the types of 
additional services needed by these students; language access, transportation, 
trauma-informed care, cultural competency, and so forth.
In conversations with the Maine Education Association last year, we realized it might 
be a good idea for there to be a commission established in order to improve the 
educational experiences of people who are resettling in Maine. LD 1702 is the result 
of these and additional discussions, and I am proud to see it under consideration. By 
gathering a group of stakeholders who know the needs of this population, we are 
hopeful there will be improvements in the educational experience for all.
Additionally, my mother was an ESL teacher at the public school I attended from 
K-12, so this issue is a personal one for me. Through her work and her students, I saw
first-hand the successes and the challenges of immigrant communities in our small 
town as I grew up. That left an impression on me, and today I now work for an 
immigrants' rights organization.
Thank you again for your consideration of LD 1702. I encourage you to pass it with 
strong support.
