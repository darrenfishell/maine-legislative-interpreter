Re: L.D. 1244, An Act Regarding Timely Payment of Undisputed Insurance Claims 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance writes in opposition L.D. 1244.   
This bill would amend 24-A M.R.S. § 2436(3) to increase the interest rate an insurer owes on 
any past due, undisputed claims or any past due, undisputed part of a claim from 1 ½% per 
month to 10% per month – 120% per year. Under existing law, payment for a claim is due 30 
days after the insurer has received proof of loss. Unless the insurer requests additional 
information or disputes a claim, any claim not paid within that 30-day period is past due.  
The BOI does not receive many complaints about this from insureds or claimants because most 
complaints involve disputed claims. Property/casualty insurers generally pay the undisputed 
amount consistent with § 2436. Claim payments under health insurance policies typically go to 
providers, not to enrollees.  
This bill might cause rates to increase and some insurers to consider leaving the Maine market. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy N. Schott 
Acting Superintendent
