Testimony
in
Neither
For
Nor
Against
LD
1747:
“An
Act
to
Return
the
Sales
Tax
Rate
to
5
Percent”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
neither
for
nor
against
LD
1747
.
As
a
share
of
income,
Mainers
pay
the
3rd-most
in
the
country
in
taxes.
1
By
that
same
standard,
Mainers
pay
the
highest
in
property
taxes
than
residents
of
any
other
state,
on
average.
2
In
contrast,
our
sales
tax
burden
is
much
lower
compared
to
other
states;
the
absence
of
local
taxes
aids
that
standing.
3
The
sales
tax
is
considered
the
most
regressive
tax,
since
low-income
earners
must
spend
more
of
their
income
to
survive.
For
lawmakers
looking
to
provide
relief
predominantly
to
low-income
earners,
cutting
the
sales
tax
seems
like
a
prudent
move.
That
said,
we
believe
this
moment
in
Maine
state
budget
history
calls
for
lasting
and
enduring
income
tax
cuts.
Revenue
forecasts
should
be
used
to
cut
income
taxes
in
order
to
set
up
the
state
for
lasting
growth.
Income
taxes
are
different
from
any
other
tax.
When
the
state
taxes
your
income,
it
steals
the
direct
fruits
of
your
labor;
it
steals
your
time.
And,
Maine
taxes
income
made
up
to
$100,000
more
than
any
other
state
in
New
England.
It's
time
to
turn
this
ship
around
and
begin
to
attract
more
middle-income
and
working-class
people
to
live
and
build
their
lives
here.
Basically,
taxes
should
only
be
levied
on
the
same
dollar
once.
It
is
not
right
for
the
government
to
tax
your
earnings,
before
you
even
see
them,
then
also
tax
you
when
you
spend
those
earnings.
Of
course,
it
doesn’t
end
there.
The
state
also
taxes
your
property
after
you’ve
bought
it,
simply
for
owning
it
for
another
year,
and
the
state
taxes
whatever
you
have
left
when
you
die.
Our
tax
structure
is
far
from
fair

Because
sales
tax
payments
stem
from
some
voluntary
transaction,
it
is
somewhat
more
moral
than
the
income
tax,
or
other
taxes
which
take
from
us
even
though
we
haven’t
interacted
in
the
economy.
Please
take
this
critical
budgetary
opportunity
to
work
on
tax
reform
which
phases
out
the
immoral
and
unproductive
income
tax.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
