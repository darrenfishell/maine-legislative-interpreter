LD 462 
To Chairpersons Teresa Pierce, Traci Gere, and the members of the Housing Committee: 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham, Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and Managers 
Association, GBAOMA. 
0 l am also a member of the Legislative Council working closely with, Attorney and Lobbyist, Dan 
Bernier representing landlords and property owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, 
Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, Auburn, and Bangor areas. 
0 I have been a landlord since 1972. l have owned a 50-unit trailer park , multi—unit, and single- 
family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. l have mostly provided affordable housing to 
low-income tenants. 
0 I am speaking in SUPPORT of this Bill. 
0 As a landlord, and representative of a landlord group, lam well aware of the lack of available, 
affordable housing. l totally agree that this temporary waiver to allow additional funds to secure 
housing for the homeless is needed during a housing shortage. The lack of housing increases 
what some landlords charge for rents because of supply and demand. If the funding bills 
proposed to supply more housing are approved, this will help to stabilize the market and we will 
see a return of affordable rental units. 
0 lam here to ask you to SUPPORT LD 462 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. l would be happy to answer any questions.
