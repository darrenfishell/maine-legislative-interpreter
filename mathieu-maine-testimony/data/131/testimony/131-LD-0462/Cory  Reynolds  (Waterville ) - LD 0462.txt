SENATOR PIERCE, REPRESENTATIVE GERE, AND MEMBERS OF THE 
JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOUSING, MY NAME IS CORY, I AM 
TESTIFYING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF LD 462, AN ACT TO ASSIST 
PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN AREAS OF HIGH RENT BY 
SEEKING A WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
HOMELESSNESS IS GETTING WORSE IN MAINE AND AROUND THE 
COUNTRY. PLEASE SUPPORT LD 462 SO THAT WE CAN ALL WORK 
TOGETHER TO END AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN MAINE.
