Augusta, Maine 04333-0100 
Dear Colleagues: 
Thank you, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, I am Nathan Carlow, and I am 
proud to represent the good people of House District One-Thirty-Seven, which includes part of 
my hometown of Buxton and part of Hollis, Maine. 
It’s an honor to appear before you to present my bill L.D. 617, An Act to Foster Career 
and Technical Education in Maine Schools by Creating an Additional Pathway to Certiﬁ1 
Industrial Arts Teachers. 
It’s easy to blame all our problems on the Covid-19 pandemic, but the issue this 
legislation seeks to correct is one that predates the Coronavirus, which itself furthered the 
aggressive deterioration of the state of industrial art programs across Maine. 
That is why I am here today. 
I 
Maine is a dexterous state, and even though we have many capable teachers equipped to 
step into an industrial arts or technical education program, our schools have been struggling to 
fmd teachers who meet the onerous qualiﬁcations required to obtain that certiﬁcation.

REP. CARLOW TESTIMONY, CONTINUED 
PAGE2 
Many schools have gotten rid of these programs altogether due to these pervasive stafﬁng 
shortages, and too many industrial art teachers in our State are delaying their hard-earned 
retirement because they know there will be no one to replace them once they’ve left. 
We must ﬁnd new opportunities to expand the pool of eligible industrial art teachers by 
allowing qualiﬁed individuals, such as teachers who are properly certiﬁed to teach other subjects 
but also possess the requisite career and teclmical experience required to effectively step into an 
industrial arts program. 
And that is precisely what this legislation directs the State Board of Education to do. 
This legislation contemplates that in order for a teacher to be eligible for this 
endorsement, they must have completed an apprenticeship registered with a statewide or national 
apprenticeship and training organization, a two-year degree or certiﬁcate from an accredited 
technical institution, a minimum number of hours of paid applied employment or teaching in the 
endorsement area being sought, and completion of a minimum number of hours of experience 
learning the trade for which the endorsement is sought. 
At this point, I must acknowledge that this won’t permanently solve the underlying 
problem, but by amending the credentialing guidelines to allow a teacher to obtain an 
endorsement for industrial arts via an alternative pathway, we can provide some measure of 
relief for schools hoping to ﬁll some of these positions. 
Thank you again, I would be happy to take questions at this time. 
Sincerely,
