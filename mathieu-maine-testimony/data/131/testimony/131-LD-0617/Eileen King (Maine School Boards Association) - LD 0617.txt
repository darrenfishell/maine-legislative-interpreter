TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 617 
AN ACT TO FOSTER CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN MAINE SCHOOLS BY 
CREATING AN ADDITIONAL PATHWAY TO CERTIFY INDUSTRIAL ARTS TEACHERS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 617. 
The difﬁculty of ﬁnding qualiﬁed educators is not new. School districts face challenges in hiring staff at every 
level, and this is no different for our CTE centers and regions. Our organizations support this bill as it 
provides a meaningful alternative pathway to attain a teaching certiﬁcate for a component of industrial arts in 
a variety of subjects taught in CTE programs. 
The alternative pathway would remove barriers to those who work in the ﬁelds of automotive body repair, 
diagnostics and mechanics, welding, electrical, carpentry, and computer-aided design who are interested in 
teaching at a CTE center. The alternative pathway will allow professionals who are highly skilled in their ﬁeld 
to teach our students emphasizing current and relevant industry standards;' 
The pathway is rigorous and will ensure that our students are taught by professionals who are qualiﬁed and 
have work experience in the endorsement they are seeking.
