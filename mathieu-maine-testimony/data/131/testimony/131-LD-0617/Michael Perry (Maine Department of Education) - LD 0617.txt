LD 617, An Act to Foster Career and Technical Education in Maine Schools by Creating an 
Additional Pathway to Certify Industrial Arts Teachers  proposes to amend certification rules to create 
a pathway for an industrial arts  endorsement for currently certified teachers . 
Industrial arts is an educational focus that teaches students about wood and metal fabrication using a 
variety of hand, power, or machine tools.  These “shop” classes or vocational classes have largely 
been su pplanted by more comprehensive Career and Technical Education (CTE) which can include 
programs in small design and technology, graphics, industrial technology, and engineering, to name a 
few.   
At present, there is a clear distinction between the requirements for attaining an industrial arts 
teaching credential and the requirements to earn a CTE endorsement .  Industrial arts is considered a 
Pk-12 teaching area and as such, requires additional training, e.g . coursework in educational 
methods .  CTEs,  by contrast, focus on 6 -12 education in particular technical areas .  This bill would 
create a pathway for a currently certified teacher to earn an industrial arts  teaching endorsement . 
The Department  is open to additional flexibility for  certification pat hways . Workforce experience can 
be a viable alternative pathway, and we look forward to discussions around the particulars of how to  
make a workforce experience pathway work for teacher certification.   It is important to note that this 
bill would require the reopening of  rule Chapter  115: The Credentialing  of Educational Personnel,  
which  is a major substantive  rule of the State Board of Education  and was revised last session.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 617 and respond to  any 
questions during the upcoming work session.   
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Michael Perry  
Acting Director of Higher Education  & Educator Support  Services
