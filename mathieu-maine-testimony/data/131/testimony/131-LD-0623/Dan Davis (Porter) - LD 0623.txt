Senator Chipman, Representative Stover, and State & Local Government Committee 
members, 
I support modifying the Maine Motor Vehicle Inspection Standards to permit 
nonstructural corrosion that does not directly affect the passenger compartment. This 
is competent and reasonable given that this is Maine,  Mainer's have little control over
the weather or the usage and application of road salts, and new vehicles are 
increasingly priced out of grasp for a majority of Mainers. Please support LD623.
Thank you,
Dan
