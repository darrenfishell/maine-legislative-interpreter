VOTE NO ON LD 1947, “An Act to Amend the Maine Food Sovereignty Act”
I urge you to OPPOSE L.D. 1947. This bill as written is concerning as it potentially 
opens the door to ordinances allowing dangerous activities that undermine Maine’s 
regulations in place to protect wildlife, the environment, and landowners in the 
pursuit of food.
