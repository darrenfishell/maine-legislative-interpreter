Maine Dairy Industry Association testimony
IN OPPOSITION to LD 1947 ‘An Act to Amend the Food Sovereignty Act’
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker , members of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry
Committee,
I am writing today to testify on behalf of the Maine Dairy Industry Association (MDIA,) in opposition to LD
1947, An Act to Amend the Food Sovereignty Act.
The Maine Dairy Industry Association (MDIA), which represents all of Maine’ s cattle dairy farms, believes
this bill is problematic for both the Maine brand, as well as for our dairy farms. Food safety and quality
guidelines are in place to protect both our consumers as well as our farms. Removing the existing safeguards
by eliminating the authority of our state agencies on point of sale and consumer transactions presents a danger
to consumers who might not be adequately educated about food safety . Food safety is a critical component to
strong markets. The safety protocols we are required to adhere to as dairy farmers are a protection mechanism
for both ourselves and our consumers. T rust in our food system has already eroded enough, it is important that
we have a standard to which we are responsible that is understood by both farmers and consumers.
W e strongly ur ge you to vote ought-not-to-pass on LD 1974.

Annie Watson
President, MDIA
