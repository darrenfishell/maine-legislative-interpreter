Dear Committee Members: 
This is all terribly confusing. 
As a landowner and owner of berry-bushes, fiddlehead patches,various mushrooms 
and fruit bearing trees...all fairly near roadside, I feel that I and others just like me are 
now going to be posting our land in perpetuity.  
And what of the right of others to hunt when and where they wish, since our wildlife 
does not belong to the landowners. Will this over-burden our LMF public 
lands...where hunting (harvesting) has to be allowed ? 
I heard it said that lawyers will be the ones who get the greatest benefits of these new 
laws. I'm thinking that statement just might have some merit...unfortunately. 
BTW...I am a strong supporter of our small farms and small farm farmers.  Was also a
strong supporter of Craig Hickman. He promised that nothing would be changing for 
landowners because of his bill. I'd like to trust that this will be true...but I can honestly
tell you; I'm worried that can't possibly be accurate without posting, once the public 
learns of this ability to freely take of another's bounty.
