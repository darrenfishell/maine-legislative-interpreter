Re: In Opposition to LD #1947 "An Act to Amend the Maine food Sovereignty Act " 
May 22nd, 2023   
Sen. Ingwerson, Rep. Pluecker and distinguished members of the Committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry; 
My name is Gina Garey; I am a professional animal behaviorist at Animal Behavior and Healing 
in Portland and the Maine State Director for Animal Wellness Action and Center for a Humane 
Economy.  
I write today in opposition to LD 1947, (An Act to Amend the Maine Food Sovereignty Act), and 
respectfully ask the committee to VOTE NO on LD 1947. 
As written, the potential implications of the language in L.D. 1947 are far reaching and 
dangerous for Maine wildlife, food safety, public health and the environment. 
 
A review by general counsel at AWA/CHE offered the following assessment:  
 
This is essentially a rehash of the previous bill, LD 1823, with much of the same language and 
the same problems.  
 
For an idea of the scope of the problem, here is a list of some of the food and ag-related Title 
22 sections that the state would be powerless to enforce at the local level if this bill were to 
pass: 
Chapter 551: PURE FOODS AND DRUGS GENERALLY  §2151 - §2216  
Chapter 553: FLOUR  §2261 - §2268  
Chapter 555: INSPECTION AND SALE OF MILK  §2311 - §2314  
Chapter 562: EATING ESTABLISHMENTS, LODGING PLACES, CAMPGROUNDS, 
RECREATIONAL AND SPORTING CAMPS, YOUTH CAMPS, PUBLIC POOLS AND PUBLIC 
SPAS  §2491 - §2503  
Chapter 563: SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND MEAT PROCESSING PLANTS  §2531 - §2538  
Chapter 564: MAINE MEAT INSPECTION ACT  §2541 - §2589  

  
So, for example, the state could no longer enforce Chapter 551 §2157. Misbranded food 
provisions, thereby allowing local “food producers” to mislabel and misrepresent their products 
to the public and fail to provide accurate ingredient descriptions with potentially dangerous or 
lethal consequences.   
  
It’s simply irresponsible.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
