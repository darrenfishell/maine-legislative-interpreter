LD 1947
Members of the ACF Committee:
LD 1947 is the second bill with largely the same language to come before this 
committee after LD 1823 just a few days ago.  It’s entirely possible that a third similar
bill will also be submitted very soon, all as a result of the Right to Food Amendment 
recently approved.     It’s unlikely that all this activity is unrelated.  What it suggests 
is a coordinated plan.
We have a hint from Billy Bob Faulkingham, an active supporter of these bills, who 
stated in an April 19, 2023 OpEd in the Bangor Daily News :
“I am, and have always been, a supporter of giving Maine hunters the same right that 
most hunters around the world have, the right to hunt on Sunday. I even helped to 
pass Maine’s first in the nation “Right to Food” amendment.”
 That’s clear enough.  Even though Sunday Hunting has been widely opposed by 
Maine citizens and rejected many times by the legislature over the years, 
Faulkingham would circumvent it, coming in the back door because the front has 
been locked.
That’s the pattern with both LD 1823 and 1947.  They undermine the laws and 
regulations approved by the legislature, weakening their authority and that of state 
agencies to protect our wildlife, our environment and the rights of all Mainers, not 
just the relatively small minority who hunt.
 A third bill may very well be in the offing.  Like the others, it is the tip of a very 
large iceberg and should be recognized and rejected for what it is and what it seeks to 
accomplish.  In the meanwhile, the committee should vote ONTP for LD 1947.
