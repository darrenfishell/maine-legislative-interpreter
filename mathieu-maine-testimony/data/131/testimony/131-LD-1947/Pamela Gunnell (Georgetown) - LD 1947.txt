LD 1947
I am writing to oppose LD 1947. It would be a disaster to have hunting  regulations 
conducted in a piecemeal fashion where each county or even town could have a 
different code. What a nightmare for landowners and citizens. Maine needs to retain a
comprehensive plan that applies equally to all and needs to retain state over site to 
protect our wildlife and wild resources. Thank you.
