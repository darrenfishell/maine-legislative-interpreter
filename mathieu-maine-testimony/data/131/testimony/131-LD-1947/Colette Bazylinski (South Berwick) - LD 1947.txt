LD 1947
I am writing to express my strong opposition to LD 1947, An Act to Amend the 
Maine Food Sovereignty Act. Similarly, I opposed LD 1823, the original bill on 
which LD 1947 is based. The most problematic language in LD 1947 is that it would 
“prohibit the State from enforcing any law or rule, taking an enforcement action or 
interfering in any way with the activities authorized by a local food ordinance.” The 
meaning of this is clear: LD 1947 would challenge, weaken, or completely abolish 
existing environmental, animal welfare, and hunting laws (for example, the law 
banning Sunday hunting, which is supported by the majority of Mainers but is 
constantly under attack by the minority hunting/gun lobby). 
The state legislature should enforce and strengthen any laws related to protecting our 
wildlife and environment. LD 1947 would only undermine these laws under the guise 
of giving Mainers the right to food sovereignty. Please oppose this bill!
