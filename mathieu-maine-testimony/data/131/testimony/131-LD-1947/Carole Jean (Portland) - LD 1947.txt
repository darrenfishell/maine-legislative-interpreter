LD 1947
As a Mainer with a strong voting history, I implore the Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry Committee to appose LD 1947, An Act to Amend the Maine Food 
Sovereignty Act. Not only would it create a free for all in killing our Maine wildlife, 
it would also take away your power to regulate the mass murder of our beloved wild 
animals here in Maine.  I cannot fathom the thought process for those who proposed 
this mass murder and total disrespect for people and wildlife, and this would also 
encourage hunters from around the Globe to come to Maine and kill with no limits.  
Vietnam's bear bile production farms have mostly closed due to fading usage, this 
new legislation would urge hunters to kill bear for a tiny little gland, horrific.
