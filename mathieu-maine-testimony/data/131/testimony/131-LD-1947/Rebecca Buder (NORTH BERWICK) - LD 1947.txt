LD 1947
PLEASE VOTE NO ON LD 1947, “An Act to Amend the Maine Food Sovereignty 
Act”.
The bill as written is absolutely unacceptable. I urge you to OPPOSE L.D. 1947 
because it disrespects the
authority of both the legislature and the agencies that created these statutes to assure 
these absolutely vital protections. This is very important, and our wildlife, 
environment and Maine landowners must be protected.
