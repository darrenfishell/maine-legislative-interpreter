LD 1947
The bill as written is unacceptable. I urge you to OPPOSE L.D. 1947 because it 
threatens to undermine multiple Maine
statutes that offer critical protections to our wildlife, our environment, and Maine 
landowners. It also disrespects the
authority of the legislature and agencies that created these statutes to assure these vital
protections.  The current Maine hunting regulations should remain the same, as 
archaic as they are.
