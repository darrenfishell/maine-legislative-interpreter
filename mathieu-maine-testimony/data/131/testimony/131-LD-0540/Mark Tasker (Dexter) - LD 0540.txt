Good Afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Health and 
Human Senrices Committee, 
My name is Mark Tasker, I am a resident of Dexter and l am here today to testify in favor of LD 540 “An 
Act to Establish Peer Respite Services for Adults with Mental Health Challenges in Maine. 
If Respite had been around before my sister committed suicide, after she found our other sister 
murdered it may have saved her life. We just we just didn’t know how or where to get her help, I believe 
she would have been willing to go to a place like this to help her collect her thoughts and remember what 
life is really about. She would have been able to process what happened to our sister, work on her future 
goals and be reminded of who really cares/loves her rather than focus on how to end it all. 
I think if Respite is in place this will give people a place to go that are on “The Edge" to be able to 
collect their bearings and focus on the future and their goals before things get so bad they either needa 
mental hospital or choose to end their lives. 
in closing I urge you to pass LD 540. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Mark Tasker 
Dexter
