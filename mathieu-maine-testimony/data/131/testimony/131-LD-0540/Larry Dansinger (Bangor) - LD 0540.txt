LD 540
To members of the Committee on Health and Human Services:
I am writing in support of LD 540, “An Act to Establish Peer Respite Centers for 
Adults with Mental Health Challenges in Maine.” 
An extremely effective way to support individuals dealing with mental health issues is
for them to get support from, to work with, and to mentor, others with mental health 
issues, whether the same kind of problem or even something different. Twelve step 
groups could be an example of a method that can be very helpful to those struggling 
with their mental health. The Consumer Council System of Maine also provides peer 
relationships that have benefited the mental health of many Maine people. 
A respite facility can especially help those who may need more intensive support in 
addressing their own mental health struggles. I expect such respite centers are 
operating in other parts of our country.
Because such centers can address the causes of mental health problems and help those
who experience those problems to heal, it is an effort, whether experimental or not, 
that is very much worth doing and worth the money appropriated for it. If successful, 
it can be a model for other mental health programs in Maine.
