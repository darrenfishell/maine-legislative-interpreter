68. I have been hospitalized voluntarily for "Mental Health Issues" in the state of 
Maine on average 68 times in 28 years. That is twice a year that MaineCare was billed
for an Emergency room visit, a mental health crisis evaluation, a 5-10 day stay at a 
Maine inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, and a "step-down" intensive outpatient 
treatment program.  Yearly, I was costing taxpayers thousands of dollars. 
Why? I had no other place to go to find people who could provide me with emotional 
support, compassion, rest, and a sense of connection to others.  I hadn't somewhere to 
go to find people who understood how I was feeling and what I was going through. 
Having had no community connections, friends, or family who had not taken 
advantage, hurt, or abused me,  I had no place to go to stop myself from falling into a 
depression so deep that I was sure I would never resurface from it. I hadn't a place to 
go to catch my breath, rest, relax and regroup so I could soldier on. 
So, I waited. Alone. Until I couldn't. Until my choices seemed distilled down to live 
or die. I always wanted to choose life. And I did. But I could not get there on my own 
without someone who cared and understood how hard it was to feel what I feel and 
live life this alone. So, I would go to my local ER. to find connection and hope. 
Imagine if there was a place I could have gone that inspired me to keep going. To 
remind me that I had a community of people who understood and believed in my 
ability to move through the pain, heal, feel joy, and meaningfully contribute to my 
community and greater society.  A place that would not have cost thousands of Maine
citizen's hard earned dollars. A place that prevented the fall. 
Please consider, dear legislative community, creating the funding, building of, and 
access to Peer Run Respites for our people in the State of Maine.
