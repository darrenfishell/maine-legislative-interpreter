Testimony from Rep. Art Bell presenting 
LD 167: An Act Regarding Eligibility for the Maine Resident Homestead 
Tax Exemption 
Good afternoon Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and esteemed 
members of the Taxation Committee. l am Art Bell, and I represent House 
District #103, Yarmouth. 
l am here before you today to present LD 167: An Act Regarding Eligibility 
for the Maine Resident Homestead Tax Exemption. 
We all know that Maine is the oldest state in our countly As property taxes 
rise from year to year, it is becoming harder and harder for older Mainers 
on fixed incomes to stay in their longtime residences. Maine's “Homestead 
Exemption ” has addressed this issue by providing a reduction of up to 
$25,000 in the value of your home for property tax purposes. 
The Homestead Exemption is available to Mainers whose homes are held 
in a “Revocable Trust” but makes no accommodation for those properties 
that are held in an “lrrevocable Trust” . This bill simply aims to make the 
Homestead Exemption available to Mainers who have their property in an 
lrrevocable Trust, combined with a Life Lease. 
Ensuring that our seniors are truly able to stay in their homes in their 
“golden years” should be a priority. I hope that you will support LD 167 to 
enable more Mainer’s to stay in their homes. 
District 103 Yarmouth and Yarmouth
