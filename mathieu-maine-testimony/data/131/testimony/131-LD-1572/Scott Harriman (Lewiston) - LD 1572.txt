Good
afternoon
Senat or
Chipman,
Repr esentativ e
Williams,
and
honor able
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T r anspor tation.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
opposition
t o
LD
1572,
“ An
Act
t o
Ensur e
Pr oper
F unding
of
the
Highwa y
F und
b y
Imposing
a
Sur char ge
on
Electric
V ehicle
Registr ation. ”
Although
I
agr ee
that
all
users
should
help
pa y
t o
maintain
our
r oads,
this
pr oposal
would
only
add
t o
the
inequities
and
dispr opor tionalities
of
our
curr ent
funding
system:
the
mot or
v ehicle
ex cise
tax
and
the
fuel
tax.
Damage
t o
our
state ’ s
r oads
occurs
as
a
function
of
a
v ehicle ’ s
weight
and
how
many
miles
it
tr a v els
on
those
r oads.
It
has
nothing
t o
do
with
a
v ehicle ’ s
sales
price
or
how
much
fuel
it
uses.
Instead
of
adding
another
la y er
t o
this
ﬂawed
system,
I
would
pr opose
simply
r eplacing
the
curr ent
ex cise
and
fuel
tax es
with
an
annual
user
f ee
based
on
each
v ehicle ’ s
gr oss
weight
r ating
(GVWR)
and
the
number
of
miles
it
tr a v els.
The
GVWR
is
printed
on
each
v ehicle ’ s
saf ety
label,
and
it
could
also
be
obtained
fr om
a
database.
The
number
of
miles
tr a v eled
is
r epor ted
e v er y
time
a
v ehicle
r egistr ation
is
r enewed.
This
would
be
a
much
fair er
and
mor e
logical
wa y
t o
assess
a
f ee
based
on
each
v ehicle ’ s
contribution
t o
r oad
damage.
One
potential
downside
is
the
loss
of
fuel
tax
r e v enue
fr om
v ehicles
r egister ed
out
of
state,
which
would
include
many
commer cial
trucks
and
t ourists’
personal
v ehicles.
T o
alle viate
these
concerns,
this
change
could
be
limited
t o
all
v ehicles
ex cept
those
that
run
on
diesel.
A
combined
appr oach
could
also
work,
with
a
per-gallon
fuel
tax
being
le vied
during
the
summer
months
alongside
this
r e vised
user
f ee
formula.
F or
these
r easons
I
ask
y ou
t o
please
v ote
Ought
Not
T o
P ass
on
LD
1572.
Thank
y ou
for
y our
time
and
for
y our
ser vice
t o
our
state.
