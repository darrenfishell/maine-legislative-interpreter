Testimony of Nina Fisher 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131“ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
Neither for Nor Against LD 1572 
An Act to Ensure Proper Funding of the Highway Fund by Imposing a Surcharge on Electric 
Vehicle Registration 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, I am Nina Fisher, Deputy Commissioner of MaineDOT. MaineDOT is neither 
for nor against LD 1572, An Act to Ensure Proper Funding of the Highway Fund by Imposing a 
Surcharge on Electric Vehicle Registration, but would like to provide you some additional 
information. 
Passenger vehicles registered in Maine, whether EV, hybrid, or straight gasoline fueled, all pay 
an annual $35 registration fee and excise tax, which goes to the state’s Highway Fund. 
Passenger vehicles also pay a $33 title fee that also goes into the Highway Fund. For EV drivers, 
that is the extent of what they pay to operate on Maine’s infrastructure. 
Thirty-one states have laws requiring a special registration fee for plug-in electric vehicles. Of 
those, 18 states also assess a fee on plug-in hybrid vehicles, which this legislation does not 
currently propose. These fees are typically in addition to traditional motor vehicle registration 
fees. 
Ten states-—Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Washington and Wyoming—enacted laws in 2019 amending or adding new fees for plug-in 
electric and some plug-in hybrid vehicles. The fees range from $50 per year in Colorado, South 
Dakota and Hawaii to $225 for a plug-in electric vehicle in Washington. Alabama, Arkansas, 
Ohio and Wyoming all set or increased fees for electric vehicles to $200 annually. 
More recently, Oklahoma and South Dakota both enacted legislation in 2021 to impose new EV 
fees. South Dakota now imposes a ﬂat $50 fee for all PEVs, While Oklahoma has tiered EV fees

based on vehicle weight, with a $110 fee for EVs under 6,000 pounds. Idaho, meanwhile, 
considered legislation in 2021 that would have increased the state’s EV registration fee to $300 
annually, making it the nation's highest, and created an alternative 2.5 cents per mile fee that 
drivers can pay in lieu of the $300 fee. Louisiana enacted legislation in 2022 establishing a $110 
fee for EVs and a $60 fee for plug-in hybrids, which is effective starting in 2023. 
Eighteen states also impose a fee for plug-in hybrid vehicles that operate on a combination of 
electricity and gasoline. The fee for plug-in hybrid vehicles ranges from $48.75 in Iowa, as of 
2021, to $100 in Alabama, Arkansas, Ohio and West Virginia. South Carolina takes a different 
approach than an amual fee, and instead requires a payment of $120 for all-electric cars and $60 
for plug-in hybrid vehicles, every two years. 
At least ﬁve states California, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi and Utah-——structure the 
additional registration fees to grow over time by tying the fees to the consumer price index or 
another inﬂation-related metric. These states are striving to avoid the declining purchasing 
power of gas taxes due to years of ﬁxed-rate structures. 
LD 1572 suggests an annual surcharge paid at registration of $72. This would be less than the 
state road user fees paid through fuel taxes of the average Maine driver. Although the 
experience of individual drivers varies, the average licensed Maine driver travels an estimated 
14,200 miles per year. This is calculated by dividing total statewide vehicle miles traveled 
(VMT) by the number of licensed drivers. The EPA estimates the national 2022 ﬂeetwide 
efficiency average is about 26 mpg. Maine average mpg could be lower given the type and age 
of vehicles. Using these data points, the average Maine driver buys about 546 gallons of 
gasoline per year (14,200/26). Multiply this average number of gallons by the Maine state 
gasoline tax of 30 cents per gallon, yields an average road user fee of about $164 per year in state 
fuel taxes paid. Federal fuel tax would add another $100. 
We hope you have found this information of use. Thank you and I am happy to try to answer 
any questions you may have.
