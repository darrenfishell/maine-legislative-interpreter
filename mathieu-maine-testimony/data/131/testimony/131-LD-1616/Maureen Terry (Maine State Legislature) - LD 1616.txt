Testimony of Rep. Maureen Terry presenting 
LD 163?; An Act to Make the Description of the State Seal Gender-neutral and to Depict 
W One of the Human Images on the State Flag as Female 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and esteemed members of the State and Local 
Government Committee, I am Maureen Terry, representing part of Gorham in House District 
108. I am happy to be here to present LD 1649, An Act to Make the Description of the State 
Seal Gender-neutral and to Depict One of the Human Images on the State Flag as Female. 
Pm proud to introduce this bill that came to me from a constituent who is exceptionally 
passionate about Maine people being more equitably depicted on the Maine ﬂag. His proposal 
would do this by directing the Secretary of State to commission a redesign of the state flag 
depicting one of the ﬁgures as female. This bill seeks to bring our antiquated ﬂag into the 
modern era and acknowledge that men and Women are equal and proud contributors to our 
state’s economy and culture. 
The bill will also amend the law governing the state seal to similarly reﬂect the intention of the 
bill by making the descriptions of the ﬁgures on the seal gender-neutral. It would do this by 
changing “husbandman ” to “farmer” and “seaman” to “sailor”. 
I appreciate your time and am grateful for the opportunity to present this bill on behalf of my 
constituent. 
District I08: Gotham (part)
