Republican Cory R.
LD 1248
Good Morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Ziegler and HHS Committee 
Members, My name is Cory Reynolds, I live in Waterville, and I am testifying in 
support of LD 1248 
“An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water” and LD 73 “An Act to Require 
Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl 
Substances.” Regarding the grave public health threat posed by PFAS in Maine, 
I Believe The Bottle Water company needs to test the their bottled waters, to make 
sure there is no chemicals and PFAS in the water. The Government is trying to kill us 
with PFAS and other dirty chemicals and is not telling us about it. With that said I ask
you to vote Ought to pass on this bill. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
