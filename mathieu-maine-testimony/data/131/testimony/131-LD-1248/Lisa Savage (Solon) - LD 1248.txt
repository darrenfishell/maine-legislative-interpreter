LD 1248
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Ziegler and HHS Committee Members,
My name is Lisa Savage, I live in Solon, and I am testifying in support of LD 1248 
“An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water” and LD 73 “An Act to Require 
Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl 
Substances.”
Regarding the grave public health threat posed by PFAS in Maine, our voluntary 
“forever chemicals” reporting arrangement with water bottlers is inadequate. There 
are many bottling sites that are not voluntarily reporting. The legislature should 
demand compliance in line with all community water systems for drinking water 
standards.
Bottled water companies should not be exempt from reporting groundwater source 
contamination to the state because Maine needs this data to establish the extent of 
PFAS contamination and to repsond.
Please vote ought to pass on this bill's support for ongoing testing, monitoring, 
reporting and transparency between the bottled water industry and state agencies for 
accountability and public health.
