LD 1248
I am testifying in support of LD 1248 “An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled 
Water” and LD 73 “An Act to Require Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for 
Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances” and encourage you to combine these 
two bills for the protection of our water. 
We need more drinking water protections for the public and should require PFAS 
testing on water that is to be sold in bottles. 
In addition, origin of the groundwater source (not multiple sources) should appear on 
bottled water labeling for transparency and accountability.
Maine's  voluntary “forever chemicals” reporting arrangement with water bottlers is 
insufficient and there are many bottling sites that are not voluntarily reporting. Bottled
water is less regulated than tap water and is a matter of public health and 
safety.Demand compliance in line with all community water systems for drinking 
water standards.
Bottled water companies should not be exempt from reporting groundwater source 
contamination to the state. This data is important for the state to be more effective in 
assessing the extent of PFAS contamination and its response after identifying what 
sources may need remediation.
Support for ongoing testing, monitoring, reporting and transparency between the 
bottled water industry and state agencies for accountability and public health.
