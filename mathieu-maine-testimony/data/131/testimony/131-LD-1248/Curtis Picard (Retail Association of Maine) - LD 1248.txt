RE: Testimony  in OPPOSITION to LD 1248 , An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water  
Dear Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer  and members of the Health and Human Services  
Committee:  
 
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I am a 
resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and  represent retailers of all sizes. 
Maine’s retailers employ more than 85 ,000 Mainers. We are here today to testify in opposition to LD 
1248 . 
 
We take no issue with  requiring bottled water companies to test for the presence of P FAS. We are 
opposed, howe ver, to requiring bottled water companies to list the results of the t est on the label. The 
label ing requirements are regu lated under federal auth ority of the US FDA. Having a pat chwork of state -
by-state labeling requirements would create unnecessary burde ns, costs and be confusing for 
consumers. We would urge the committee to examine the federal re gulations and determin ing if federal 
auth ority would preempt any proposed state law in this arena.  
 
Additi onall y, when it comes to pr ivate label bott led water, we believe that the testing requirement 
should fall on the b ottle r, not the pr ivate label company. On ly the bottler would have the means and 
access to test the wa ter under whatever re gulation is required. Under Section 4 of the bill, it read s, “A 
bottler or a person who sells wa ter. . .” The section goes on to state that the label needs t o show the 
source, the test date, and the P FAS level.  These are things that only th e bottler will be able to produce, 
not the private label compan y. 
  
Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Curtis Picard, CAE  
President and CEO
