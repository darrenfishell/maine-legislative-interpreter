LD 1248
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Zeigler and HHS Committee Members, 
I ask you to please support LD 73 "An Act to Require Bottled  Water Companies to 
Monitor for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances" and LD 1248 "An Act to 
Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water".  Please also consider the combining of these 
two bills.
Bottled water companies should be held to the same standards as community water 
supplies for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of those who choose to 
consume it.  Maine's current voluntary reporting process does not offer any 
protections for consumers that may be unknowingly ingesting these harmful 
chemicals so correcting this unnecessary risk is important.  
It is not a stretch to think that most consumers could easily have the impression that 
their bottled water meets the same standards as their publicly supplied tap water as 
they consume it daily, all while Maine has no PFAS testing requirements which are 
being exposed in an overwhelming amount of locations. Correcting this dangerous 
issue is essential.
Requiring the bottled water companies to report identified contamination sites to the 
state is also important for the health and safety of the communities that these water 
exporters profit from along with the people who consume it. 
Finally, with Maine's unfortunate PFAS problem, including the source of extraction 
on the label of bottled water is important for transparency and should not be 
complicated for the bottler to do.    
Supporting these bills will help protect the health, safety and welfare of those who 
choose to consume bottled water which promotes the state of Maine as it's source.    
Thank you for your time and consideration on this important matter.
