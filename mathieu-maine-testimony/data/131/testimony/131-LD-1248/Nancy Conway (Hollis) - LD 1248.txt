LD 1248
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Ziegler and HHS Committee Members, 
My name is Nancy Conway.  I live in Hollis, ME and I am testifying in support of LD
1248 “An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water” and LD 73 “An Act to Require
Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl 
Substances”.
Passage of these bills requiring PFAS (“forever chemicals”) testing on water that is to
be sold in bottles is an important step to ensure consumers of bottled water are 
afforded the same drinking water protections as those acquiring water from 
community water systems.  
As a matter of public safety, bottled water should be regulated at the same standards 
as tap water.   Mandatory ongoing testing, monitoring and reporting by bottled water 
companies is necessary to achieve compliance.  
I believe the consumer has the right to know the specific groundwater source when 
purchasing bottled water.  After all, in many cases the assumption is that the water is 
coming from a spring in the Maine mountains when, in fact, it is coming from a 
community water system or from a previous farmland area.   While one area may be 
entirely free of “forever chemicals”, another may not.  Labeling with origin of 
groundwater source will go a long way to ensure accountability.  
Respectfully,
Nancy Conway
