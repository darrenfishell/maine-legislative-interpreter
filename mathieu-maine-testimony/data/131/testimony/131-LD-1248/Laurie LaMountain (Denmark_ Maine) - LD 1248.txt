LD 1248
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Ziegler and HHS Committee Members,
My name is Laurie LaMountain, I am a resident of Denmark, ME, and I am testifying 
in support of LD 1248 “An Act to Ensure the Quality of Bottled Water” and LD 73 
“An Act to Require Bottled Water Companies to Monitor for Perfluoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances.” I believe combining these two bills would create a 
commonsense response to the growing threat/occurrence of “forever chemicals” in 
our groundwater sources.
Consumers have a right to know what’s in their water, especially since most of them 
are buying bottled water expressly because they believe branding and marketing the 
bottled water industry in Maine uses to sell their product ensures they are drinking 
water that is safer and cleaner than the water that flows from their taps. Ironically, 
municipal tap water is currently more regulated than bottled water.
With more and more instances of PFAS contamination occurring in Maine, people 
have a right to know that the water they’re consuming is safe. LD 73 will do that. It 
makes total sense to take it a step further by requiring labeling that is site specific and 
identifies the precise source of water sold in bottles in Maine. Combining the two bills
would achieve complete transparency through testing, monitoring, and labeling. I 
hope you will support the combination and passage of these two proposed 
bills—because enhancing drinking water protections for Mainers is what it really 
means to be from Maine.
