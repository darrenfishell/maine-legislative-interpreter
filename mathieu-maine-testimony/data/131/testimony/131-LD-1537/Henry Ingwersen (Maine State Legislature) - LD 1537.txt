Testimony of Senator Henry Ingwersen 
Presenting LD 1537 “An Act to Amend the Laws Relating to the Prevention of Perﬂuoroalkyl 
and Polyﬂuoroalkyl Substances Pollution and to Provide Additional Funding” 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
April 26, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. My name is Senator Henry Ingwersen, and I represent Senate District 
32, including the City of Biddeford and the towns of Lyman, Dayton, Hollis, and Arundel. I 
am before you today to present and speak in support of LD 1537 “An Act to Amend the Laws 
Relating to the Prevention of Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution and to 
Provide Additional Funding”. 
As Maine started to grapple with the issue of PFAS contamination across the state, the 
legislature worked in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation to determine where the PFAS is 
coming from and to reduce the sources of PFAS entering into our bodies and in our 
environment. This led to the passage of LD 1503, a bill that requires manufacturers of 
products with intentionally added PFAS to report the presence of those substances in those 
products to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) beginning in 2023. It bans 
the sale of products containing intentionally added PFAS by 2030 unless the use of PFAS in 
that product has been designated as a currently unavoidable use by the department. LD 1503 
also allows the DEP to name categories of products to ban the use of PFAS in between now 
and 2030 before the the full ban goes into effect. The department is required to create a PFAS 
source reduction program that provides information, education and, to the extent funds are 
available, grants to publicly owned treatment works and municipalities to reduce PFAS 
entering air, water, or land. The bill had overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House 
and Senate. 
As the implementation of LD 1503 began, it became apparent that there were some technical 
ﬁxes needed to make the implementation go more smoothly. This bill, LD 1537, provides 
those technical ﬁxes. It does several things. First, the bill extends the deadline for reporting 
the use of perﬂuoroalkyl and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in products for sale until 
October 1, 2023. The Department is in the middle of rulemaking as We speak but does not yet 
have ﬁnalized rules that provide industry with the information they need to be able to report 
the uses of PFAS in their products as required under LD 1503. Extending the deadline will 
allow the Department to ﬁnalize the rules to provide guidance to those required to report. 
Second, this bill provides a small business exemption for businesses that have less than $20M 
in annual national sales. Those businesses will not be required to disclose if the products they 
manufacture contain PFAS. They will still not be able to sell products containing PFAS if 
those products are banned due to non-essential uses of PFAS under section 5 of the law.

This should protect Maine’s farms and small businesses from having to utilize resources to 
report the use of PFAS to the DEP. The original intent of LD 1503 was never to require small 
businesses to report this information. Most small businesses in Maine do not utilize PFAS in 
the manufacturing process. It also clariﬁes that packaging is exempt from this law as it is 
already regulated under a different statute. 
One of the biggest hurdles to implementing this law is the lack of staff and resources at the 
Department. Right now, the safer chemicals program under the DEP is woefully understaffed. 
So the next thing LD 1537 does is provide allocations for additional staff and resources to help 
make the implementation of the law go more smoothly. 
Current draft rules for LD 1503 from the Department require companies to report the amount 
of each intentionally added PFAS using a unique identification code, a chemical abstracts 
service registry number (CAS). But not all PFAS have CAS numbers. By implying that PFAS 
without a CAS cannot be registered, which is not the case, not all PFAS will be registered, 
allowing for the introduction and usage of novel chemicals that may worsen the PFAS crisis. 
In those circumstances there are alternatives to the CAS number that can be utilized 
including a PMN number, EPA accession number, a full chemical name and formula, or at 
least a generic chemical name. LD 1537 adds language that requires that the Department 
report the use of PFAS even if there is no CAS number associated with that particular PFAS. 
The point of LD 1503 is to reduce the sources of PFAS here in Maine to help stop further 
contamination of our environment. To do that we need the Department to move forward on 
banning other categories of products as allowed under LD 1503 that we know are 
unnecessary. We should not be focusing on the “unavoidable use” provision until we have 
made strides to reduce current sources of PFAS in our environment. Therefore, this bill will 
also require that the Department adopt a rule starting in 2025 identifying at least one product 
category or use that may not be sold, offered for sale or distributed in this State if it contains 
intentionally added PFAS. It prohibits the department prior to January 1, 2028, from 
providing an exemption for products in which the use of PFAS is a currently unavoidable use 
unless the department has adopted rules that identify a relevant related product category or 
use for a sales prohibition. Technology around PFAS is changing every day. What is necessary 
for use now may not be in 2, 3 or 4 years, so we should focus on phasing out the uses that we 
know are avoidable now and wait until closer to the implementation deadline of 2030 to 
deﬁne what is currently unavoidable. 
We did talk through these changes with the Department. Some of them they support, like 
providing a small business exemption, and some they do not, like requiring that there is at 
least one product category phased out each year starting in 2025. But, the point of the original 
statute was to protect the health and environment of Mainers from further PFAS 
contamination. We need to do all we can to make sure that we are doing that and these ﬁxes 
to LD 1503 that this bill provides will help move us in that direction.
