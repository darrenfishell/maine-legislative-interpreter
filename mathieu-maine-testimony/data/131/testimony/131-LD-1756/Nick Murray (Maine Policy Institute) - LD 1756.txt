Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1756:
“An
Act
to
Protect
Employee
Freedom
of
Speech”
Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1756
.
Ironically,
this
bill
seeks
to
protect
workers
from
being
fired
if
they
choose
to
not
attend
a
required
meeting
for
their
job.
If
an
employer
is
sponsoring
a
meeting
which
it
requires
as
a
condition
of
employment,
and
an
employee
refuses,
the
state
has
no
right
to
step
in
the
middle
of
that
relationship
and
give
the
employee
private
cause
of
action
to
sue.
It
is
simply
not
the
role
of
government
to
outline
the
minutiae
of
every
worker’s
job
description.
It
is
not
the
state’s
job
to
protect
employees
who
refuse
to
do
their
job.
Incredibly,
LD
1756
would
allow
employees
who
do
not
fulfill
the
requirements
of
their
job,
to
sue
their
employer.
It
is
absurd.
LD
1756
unintentionally
diminishes
the
First
Amendment
right
of
employers,
in
an
attempt
to
protect
the
rights
of
workers.
One’s
rights
end
where
another’s
begin,
therefore
the
government
cannot
protect
the
rights
of
one
if
doing
so
infringes
on
the
rights
of
another.
Tellingly,
this
bill
exempts
“religious
employers,”
presumably
because
the
sponsor
knows
that
it
would
infringe
on
that
employer's
free
speech
and
association
rights.
If
that
is
the
case,
then
what
makes
a
“non-religious
employer”
subject
to
this
sort
of
governmental
interference
into
their
free
association
rights?
The
irony
and
absurdity
of
this
bill
is
compounded
further
given
the
fact
that
the
sponsor
is
OK
with
workers
being
compelled
to
financially
support
a
union
as
a
condition
of
employment,
but
not
with
workers
being
compensated
to
attend
employer-sponsored
meetings.
This
bill
turns
the
status
quo
of
employment
law
on
its
head.
Please
deem
LD
1756
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
focus
on
protecting
the
free
association
rights
of
all
Mainers,
instead
of
on
boldly
unconstitutional
attempts
to
silence
the
speech
of
employers.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
