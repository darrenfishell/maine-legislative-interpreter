Re: LD 1756 – An Act to Protect E mployee Freedom of Speech  
Dear Committee Members:  
 
On behalf of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, I write to express our co ncerns with LD.1756 , 
which would  create  a so-called Captive Audience law in Maine.   
These bills typically masquerade as “protecting free speech in the workplace” bills, the text of these bills 
tends to reach beyond their intended purpose . As some examples:  
• An employer may now have to consider whether discussions involving its position on matters of 
public importance, such as public health measures  and COVID19 vaccine mandates, fall within 
the definition of legislation, regulation or polit ical matters.  
• Another emerging and common topic of conversation in the workplace is diversity, equity and 
inclusion. Like public health discussions, an employer may now have to consider whether DEI 
discussions and trainings fall within the undefined sco pe of an employer sponsored meeting with 
the primary purpose of communicating the employer's position on political matters. Under this 
law, employees could theoretically refuse to participate in employer -sponsored DEI discussions 
and trainings, claiming  that these meetings involve the employer's views on religious or political 
matters.  
It should be noted that only three states in the country have a similar  law – all of which have been 
challenged on First Amendment grounds. Connecticut passed a bill in 2022, but it is currently being 
challenged in Federal Court.
