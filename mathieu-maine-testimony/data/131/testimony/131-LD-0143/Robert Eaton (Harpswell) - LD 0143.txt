Testimony in support of LD 142, An Act to Fund Climate-related Service Work
 
To: Sen. Joseph Rafferty, Representative Michael Brennan, and Members of the Committee 
On Education and Cultural Affairs From: (YOUR NAME, TOWN, ORGANIZATIONAL 
AFFILIATION IF RELEVANT)
 
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Committee on Education
and Cultural Affairs, 
I am Bob Eaton and live in Harpswell.  I serve on town committees and am 
particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on our community. I am 
writing to testify in support of LD 142. 
Our family is currently hosting an Americorps volunteer.  We need more such young 
people to help communities in Maine to study, analyze, and take action to mitigate 
and then reverse the affects of climate change.  
 Thank you for your kind consideration of my letter,
Bob Eaton
