 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly pr esenting  
 LD 143, “  An Act to Support Rural Service Pr ogramming and Pr omote  
 Volunteerism”  
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs  
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Rafferty,  Representative   Brennan   and  distinguished   members   of  the 
 Joint   Standing   Committee   on  Education   &  Cultural   Affairs.   My  name   is  Morgan  Rielly ,  and  I 
 represent   House   District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  here  today   to  present   LD 
 143,  An  Act  To  Support   Rural   Service   Programming   and  Promote   Volunteerism   ,  which  
 would fully fund the existing   Maine Service Fellows (MSF)   Program.  
 Backgr ound of MSF:  
 First,   allow   me  to  give  a  brief   history   of  the  development   and  passage   of  the  program.   MSF   was 
 born  out  of  a  “service   think   tank”   that  Volunteer   Maine,   our  state  service   commission,   hosted   in 
 the  Fall  of  2020.   The  participants   represented   small   municipal   offices,   nonprofits,   school  
 districts,   elected   officials,   and  businesses   from   across   the  state.   All  those   present   recognized   that 
 Maine   needs   to  expand   service   programming   in  our  rural   communities   to  address   the  negative  
 economic   impact   rural   communities   have   faced   from   the  COVID-19   pandemic,   along   with 
 ongoing   issues   around   public   health,   housing,   and  environmental   concerns.   Those   in  attendance  
 identified   a  gap  in  our  service   infrastructure,   with  many   small   rural   communities   and 
 micro-or ganizations   unable   to  support   traditional   service   programs   like  AmeriCorps   in  their 
 communities   due  to  the  high  cost  and  federal   red  tape.   Another   key  issue   members   focused   on 
 was the need to retain younger Mainers here in the state, particularly in rural communities.  
 Volunteer   Maine,   stakeholders,   and  I  then  drafted   and  introduced   legislation   (LD  1010)   to 
 establish the MSF Program during the first session of the 130th Legislature.

 LD  1010,   like  LD  143,  was  a  bipartisan   piece   of  legislation.   The  bill  passed   in  the  State   and 
 Local   Government   Committee,   which   has  oversight   of  Volunteer   Maine,   with  bipartisan   support  
 before   being   enacted   in  the  House   and  Senate.   Governor   Janet   Mills   signed   LD  1010   into  law  in 
 June  of  2021.   Sadly ,  Volunteer   Maine   and  I  were   only  able  to  secure   enough   funding   for  one 
 fellow   during   the  second   session   and  the  commission   has  received   private   funding   for  only  one 
 other   fellow .  We  had  aimed   to  fund  the  pilot  program   at  $350,000   a  year  (for  three   years).   This 
 amount would have supported a small group of initial Fellows.  
 On  the  guidance   of  former   Representative   Will  Tuell,  then  a  member   of  State   and  Local,   we 
 amended   LD  1010   to  include   an  implementation   task  force   to  help  guide   the  program   in  its  early  
 stages   along   with  defining   “rural   communities.”   Volunteer   Maine   adopted   USDA ’s  RUCA   codes  
 to  determine   where   Maine   Service   Fellows   will  operate.   For  those   who  don’t  know ,  RUCA  
 stands   for  rural-urban   commuting   area  codes.   These   codes   are  used  to  classify   U.S.  Census   tracts  
 using measures of population density , urbanization, and daily commuting.  
 Currently ,  the  communities   that  are  eligible   for  the  Maine   Service   Fellows   program   are  in  the 
 following   counties:   Aroostook,   Franklin,   Hancock,   Knox,   Lincoln,   Oxford,   Piscatquis,   Somerset,  
 Waldo,   and  Washington.   There   are  also  some   towns   in  Penobscot   County   that  qualify   as  long  as 
 they  have   populations   under   5,000.   Eligible   sponsors   for  MSF   are  public   or  private   non-profits,  
 state/county/local   government,   education   institutions,   faith-based   organizations,   federally  
 recognized   tribes,   and  regional   organizations   that  are  based   within   the  communities   previously  
 mentioned.   Volunteer   Maine,   in  their  testimony ,  can  go  into  further   detail   about   sponsor  
 qualifications   and  sponsor   obligations.   They   can  also  discuss   the  commission's   obligations   and 
 the  application   process   for  both  Fellows   and  host  communities   and  organizations.   I  do  want   to 
 clarify   that  organizations   that  currently   host  AmeriCorps,   VIST As,  or  other   service-related  
 members are not eligible to sponsor a Service Fellow . 
 The  task  force   determined   six  key  areas   that  Maine   Service   Fellows   will  focus   on  that  include   the 
 following:   COVID-19   recovery ,  housing   (including   eviction   prevention),   workforce  
 development,   substance   use  prevention   and  recovery ,  public   health   (including   mental   health),  
 and  climate   action   areas.   Service   Fellows   devote   full-time   work,   around   1,800   hours   over  12

 months,   in  their  respective   communities.   They   commit   to  two-years   of  service,   are  paid  a  living  
 wage,   and  upon   completion   of  service   receive   an  educational   loan  payment   that  is  roughly  
 $5,700 or 2% of the living allowance.  
 MSF v . other existing service pr ograms:  
 During   the  130th   Legislature   there   was  confusion   about   the  Maine   Service   Fellows,   existing  
 AmeriCorps   programs,   and  the  Maine   Climate   Corps.   I  want   to  again   assure   the  Legislature   that 
 MSF   is  designed   to  complement,   not  compete,   with  the  existing   Maine   AmeriCorps   program   and 
 Maine’ s  Climate   Corps.   MSF   is  specifically   designed   for  our  small   communities   and 
 micro-or ganizations   in  defined   rural   areas,   allowing   for  a  quicker   implementation   of  the  program  
 on  the  ground   and,  therefore,   a  quicker   return   on  investment.   Communities   can  access   Fellows’  
 help  more   rapidly   because   the  application   process   and  accountability   requirements   are 
 streamlined.   As  a  state-based   service   program,   a  broader   set  of  community   needs   can  be 
 addressed,   as  opposed   to  federally-prescribed   funding   priorities.   Our  small   towns   know   what  
 they  need,   and  the  MSF   Program   will  give  them   the  support   to  take  on  these   issues   and  build  
 sustainable infrastructure that will continue to operate after Fellows have left these communities.  
 Goals of LD 143:  
 Currently ,  79  communities   qualify   for  Fellows   with  20  communities   having   already   requested  
 one.  Milinocket   has  requested   a  Fellow   to  provide   assistance   with  community   decisions   and 
 plans   related   to  economic   development.   Pleasant   Point   (Sipayik)   has  requested   a  Fellow   for 
 coordinating   a  community   home   weatherizing   project.   These   Fellows   will  be  starting   their 
 service   this  spring.   And,   a  coalition   of  10  Washington   County   ambulance   associations   requested  
 a  Fellow   to  help  lead  a  revitalization   of  EMS   volunteers.   Only   2  of  the  10  ambulance  
 associations can respond on a 24/7 basis.  
 Volunteer   Maine   cannot   operate   an  effective   program   with  only  two  Service   Fellows   and  there   is 
 a  strong   demand   and  need   among   our  rural   communities   for  a  Fellow .  Volunteer   Maine,

 communities   and  organizations   in  these   rural   parts   of  the  state,   and  myself   would   like  to  see  a 
 fully funded program, which LD 143 would accomplish.  
 Service   programs   in  Maine,   as  seen  with  Maine’ s  Conservation   Corps,   typically   generate   $3  in 
 return   investments   for  every   $1  that  is  spent,   which   stays   in  the  communities   service   members  
 operate   in.  AmeriCorps   programing   has  generated   roughly   $34  in  return   investment   for  every  
 federal   dollar   spent.   Volunteer   Maine   has  said  they  would   plan  to  see  a  return   on  investment   for 
 the  Maine   Service   Fellows   Program   with  the  money   staying   within   these   communities,   building  
 up  local   infrastructure   that  will  make   them   and  partner   organizations   self-sustaining   after 
 Fellows have left.  
 This  is  a  fiscally   smart   investment   that  will  leverage   state  and  private   monies   in  order   to  make  
 the  strongest   possible   impact   in  aiding   rural   communities   that  don’t  have   the  capacity   for 
 traditional   AmeriCorps   programming,   while   promoting   civic   engagement   and  volunteerism.  
 And,   it  will  help  with  workforce   development   while   retaining   younger   Mainers   in  state  and  in 
 our rural communities.  
 With  a  fully-funded   Maine   Service   Fellows   program   of  15  Fellows,   Volunteer   Maine   and  I  hope  
 that  we  will  be  able  to  use  the  work   of  these   Fellows   over  the  next  couple   of  years   to  promote  
 future   private-public   partnerships   that  will  provide   additional   private   funds   and  offset  future  
 costs of the program.  
 Thank   you  very  much   for  your  time  and  consideration.   I  would   be  happy   to  answer   any  questions  
 or to provide you with any information for your upcoming work session.
