Good morning Sen. Rafferty, Rep. Pierce and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
My name is Dave Miramant and I live in Camden. 
The past 2 years have shown that the COVID 19 vaccine does not prevent infection or
transmission of Covid. Despite this many folks are still trying to hang onto policies 
that have been proven wrong. 
The facts about the vaccines that were formerly deemed “misinformation” have been 
steadily revealed to have been correct from the beginning: 
Vaccines do not prevent the virus. 
Vaccines do have side effects that are harming and killing vulnerable individuals. 
Drug companies have immunity from prosecution even if their products harm and kill 
those who are getting the vaccines.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is the government-established 
reporting system to document vaccine injuries and death and the evidence is available 
there. Please look at the facts and represent your constituents.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
