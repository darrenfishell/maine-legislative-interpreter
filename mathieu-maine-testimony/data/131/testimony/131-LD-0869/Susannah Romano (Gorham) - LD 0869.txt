LD 869
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
committee, 
I am asking you today to vote ought to pass on LD869, an 
Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting a Mandate for Schoolchildren for a 
COVID-19 Vaccine or a Vaccine Under an Emergency Use Authorization.  I have 3 
school-aged children.  The Covid-19 vaccine, or any other vaccine under an 
“Emergency Use Authorization” should never be required to access education. 
Vaccines with EUA status should be available to those who want it, but never forced 
on those who do not.  Thank you for your time.
