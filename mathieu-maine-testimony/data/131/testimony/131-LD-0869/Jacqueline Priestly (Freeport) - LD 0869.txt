I am in favor of this bill. To require a vaccine for children to enjoy their right to free 
public education that has no long term safety data for an illness that has been 
determined to be low risk for that age group is unreasonable at best. These policies 
are meant to put every child's health and wellness first, not just those from families 
who share the same viewpoints. If we continue to require more and more 
immunizations for every illness we encounter, we are teaching our children that they 
are vectors for disease and their schools are hubs for infection that they must fear and 
in doing so, we continue to sacrifice their mental, physical and emotional health. We 
must allow our kids to be kids and teach them the value of caring for their bodies and 
their immune systems will do their job - especially for a disease with such low 
severity and high survival in children. We must also trust and allow all parents to 
make the choice that’s right for their children without judgement or segregation - 
whichever way they choose - as vaccines may be the right choice for some and not for
others, both on an intuitive and biological level. There has never been a one size fits 
all answer to ending or avoiding a virus and there never will be. Without the passing 
of this bill, we as a state will cause unnecessary harm to many children who are facing
segregation from their peers and would create an atmosphere that says it's ok to treat 
children differently based on lifestyle choices. It’s time for our Maine Department of 
Education and our communities to support ALL of the students and families they 
serve and pass this bill to protect students' right to education and prohibit and 
necessary COVID19 immunization requirement.
