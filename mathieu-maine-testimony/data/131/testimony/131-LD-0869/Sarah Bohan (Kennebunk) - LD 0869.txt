LD 869
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education & Cultural 
Affairs Committee, I am testifying in support of LD 869.
My eight-year-old son is autistic. He currently attends public school, which has 
helped his developmental progress tremendously. He is only able to be present at 
school because of the IEP exemption that was included in LD 798. After seeing how 
much school has helped his treatment, I cannot help but worry about children with 
new IEP’s who are excluded from the current special education exemption. It strikes 
me as being legally inconsistent from a disability-rights perspective to only allow 
exemptions for children who had existing individual education plans earlier than 
2021. All special-needs children deserve access to education. LD 869 would help 
protect my son’s access to school, which is vital to his well-being. The Covid 19 
vaccine should never be mandated for school children, and this bill would help ensure
that it does not. 
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Sarah Bohan, LMT
