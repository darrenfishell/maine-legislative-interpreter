LD 869
Dear distinguished members of the committee and Senators, my name is Heather 
Sprague I live in Cushing. I write in favor of LD869 to prohibit mandates for children 
to be jabbed with covid 19 vaccines not only because there are no exemptions to 
protect them from being kicked out of school or prohibited from going to public 
access schools because we know the vaccine doesnt prevent covid, they injure, mame 
and kill. I am a member of the Childrens Health Network run by Robert F Kennedy Jr
who is a democrat that has many statistics and facts backing up my statements. It 
seems to me that this is to control the people of Maine through emergency or not and 
should be against the law to mandate any of us to take a rushed, untested and 
dangerous vaccine. In fact the legislature and Governor has put many Mainers in 
jeopardy by mandating the vaccine. Thousands of nurses were fired for not wanting to
be experimented on with an experimental vaccine putting great strain on our hospitals 
putting more people in danger of not getting proper and safe care because they are 
overwhelmed with people who did take the covid19 vaccine. Please, I beg of you vote
yes to prohibit any other or further vaccine mandates that put us in more danger than 
with without them and realize that the facts are the covid vaccine does not work and 
there is no need for any kind of mandate or emergency. Its insanity to believe 
otherwise.
