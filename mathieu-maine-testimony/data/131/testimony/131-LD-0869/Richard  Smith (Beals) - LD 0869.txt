LD 869
Esteemed committee members, 
LD 869 ought to pass! Mainers should not be mandated to have their children injected
with Covid-19 vaccines in order to attend school. 
These vaccines were hastily made, and not enough is known of the long-term side 
effects to have them deemed safe. I cannot, in good conscience, force the Covid 
vaccine on my child. The government should not put Mainers in the position of 
choosing between their childrens' safety and their childrens' education.
Please pass LD 869!
Thank you, 
Richard Smith
