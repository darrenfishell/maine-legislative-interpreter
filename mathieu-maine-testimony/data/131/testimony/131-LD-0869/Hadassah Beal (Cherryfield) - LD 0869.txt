Testimony of Hadassah P . Beal
Testimony in Support of LD 869
An Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting a Mandate for
Schoolchildren for a COVID-19 Vaccine or a Vaccine Under an
Emergency Use Authorization 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Hadassah Beal of Cherryfield, Maine. I am writing in
support of LD 869, An Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting a Mandate for
Schoolchildren for a COVID-19 Vaccine or a Vaccine Under an Emergency Use Authorization.  
Mandates requiring schoolchildren to take a vaccine that their parents deem unnecessary, non-
beneficial, or dangerous to the child's health are an infringement upon parental rights. No one 
knows better than the parents of a child what is best and needful for them. The government 
must not be allowed to continue overstepping any longer. Please vote in favor of LD 869, 
removing this unnecessary, unconstitutional mandate. 
Thank you for your consideration.
Hadassah P . Beal
