LD 869
Distinguished members of the Education and Cultural Committee, 
I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 869. Maine's children, including my 
own, deserve the opportunity to attend school.  The parent's of Maine schoolchildren 
deserve to not have to make a choice between a COVID vaccine or other vaccines 
under emergency use authorization and their children being able to attend school.
Thank you,
Dorothy Kinchen
