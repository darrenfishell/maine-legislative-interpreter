LD 869   An Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting a
Mandate for Schoolchildren for a COVID-19 Vaccine or a
Vaccine Under an Emergency Use Authorization   
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield.  I urge you to support LD 869's prohibiting of a Covid-19 
vaccine mandate for school children.
Parents should be the ones to decide which vaccines their children will or will not receive, not the 
government.  And to require a vaccine that has been approved with little testing and via emergency use 
authorization is not only wrong, but also dangerous.
Where is the future of our country if not in the lives of the next generation? 
As of March 24, 2023, V AIRS COVID Vaccine Reports in children, ages 6 months - 17 years, reveal 
184 deaths, 601 permanently disabled, and 1,450 victims of myocarditis.  And those are just the 
numbers reported.  How many more have been injured or have died from this vaccine without it being 
reported as such?
So why are we requiring a new and insufficiently tested vaccine in order to attend public school?  It is 
irresponsible to force our young people to either be injected or be marginalized and excluded from the 
system.
It is for this reason that I ask you to support LD 869's prohibition of these mandates.
Thank you.
