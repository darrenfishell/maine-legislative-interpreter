LD 869
I am writing to urge you to support LD 869. The removal of religious and 
philosophical objections from vaccine requirements is wholly un-American and 
blatantly un-Constitutional. With the COVID-19 vaccine mandates, we saw an 
egregious misuse of the power of government. Friends and neighbors lost their 
healthcare jobs because they refused to compromise their principles to appease the 
Governor and her appointees. Nobody should ever be required to submit to a medical 
treatment or procedure they do not agree with for any reason. Nobody should ever 
have their right to an education contingent upon submitting to such treatment or 
procedure, and the same holds true for someone’s right to work. 
One may have any of a host of reasons to wish to abstain from any particular vaccine. 
Perhaps it is because it could have been developed from fetal cells. Or, it might be 
that one feels that the technology is too risky. In my case, my wife had her hearing 
damaged by a vaccine—something that we learned is all too common. Regardless of 
the reason, the decision is the individual’s not government’s.
Given that the government has so recently so often issued complete untruths about the
safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, the public has every reason to not trust 
public health officials, their recommendations, and any mandates based on them.
Please use your vote to support LD 869.
Sincerely,
Anthony Shostak
