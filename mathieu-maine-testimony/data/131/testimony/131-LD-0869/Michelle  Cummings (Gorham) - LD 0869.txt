LD 869
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
   I am testifying in SUPPORT of LD51, LD869, LD1098, LD1148, LD 1209 and LD 
1228. My family has been greatly impacted since the removal of religious and 
philosophical exemptions. We went from a two-income household to a single income 
household so that I can stay home to educate and care for our 2 children. This was not
our plan and has hurt us financially. It is devastating knowing that we are living in a 
state where not everyone has an equal opportunity to an education. Our roots are here 
in Maine, but we have made serious considerations to relocate to another state for a 
more promising future. I am in favor of these bills because they reinstate and support 
basic human rights to choose which medical interventions to undergo without 
coercion. Thank you for your time and consideration.
