I am in support of this bill.  It is our constitutional right to decide what is best for 
ourselves and our children's health.  Keeping children out of schools goes against the 
constitution in the pursuit of our God given rights of life and liberty.  Parental Rights 
are a God given right.  Mandates for emergency use vaccines are dangerous and not 
constitutional.  The effects of any new vaccine are not well known for at least ten 
years.  We've already seen the negative effects of this vaccine especially in the young.
