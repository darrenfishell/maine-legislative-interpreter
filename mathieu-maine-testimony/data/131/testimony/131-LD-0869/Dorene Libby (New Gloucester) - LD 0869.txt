LD 869
Chair and Members of this Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to support passage of LD869.  Those that serve are 
bound by oath to protect our private rights, including our right over our private health 
and that of our liberty interest in our children.  Compelling Maine children to inject a 
substance into their body as a prerequisite to education is simply wrong. Passage of 
LD 869 corrects this treasonous harm to the People and establishes honor to the oath 
each of you have taken to honor the Maine Constitution.  It is your duty to support 
passage of this bill.  Thank you.
