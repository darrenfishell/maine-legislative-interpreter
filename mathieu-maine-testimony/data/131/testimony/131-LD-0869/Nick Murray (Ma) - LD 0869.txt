Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
869,
LD
1148,
and
LD
1228.
Despite
recent
action
by
Maine’s
university
and
community
college
systems
to
rescind
their
COVID-19
vaccine
mandates
for
students
and
staff,
these
bills
are
still
very
important.
Without
them,
the
damage
caused
by
these
policies
in
the
last
few
years
would
occur
again
in
the
future.
Policies
which
mandate
young
people
take
an
emergency-use
vaccine
for
any
reason,
especially
to
protect
disease
for
which
they
face
a
minute
risk
of
severe
illness,
1
are
so
egregious
to
liberty
and
equality
that
the
Legislature
must
ensure
it
never
happens
again.
Our
higher
education
systems
coerced
students
to
take
the
COVID-19
vaccine
before
the
scientific
community
knew
how
effective
or
safe
it
was,
or
give
up
their
educational
path
and
future.
State
and
federal
officials,
despite
this
lack
of
knowledge,
continued
to
push
the
vaccine
on
younger
people.
The
people
who
spoke
out
against
the
sort
of
injustice
that
the
University
of
Maine
System,
Maine
Community
College
System,
Maine
Maritime
Academy,
and
other
institutions
of
higher
learning
across
the
nation
perpetrated
were
coerced,
canceled,
and
silenced
by
the
press
and
social
media
companies
at
the
encouragement
of
government
officials.

But,
ultimately
the
dissidents
were
right.
There
is
not
now,
nor
was
there
ever,
a
legitimate
public
health
reason
to
mandate
this
new
vaccine,
because
it
does
not
stop,
or
even
significantly
reduce
infection
or
transmission.
Data
presented
in
a
September
2022
letter
to
the
editors
of
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
show
that
the
protection
offered
by
COVID-19

vaccination
against
infection
for
children
wanes
precipitously,
as
is
the
case
for
adults
as
well.

A
recent
study
on
indoor
COVID-19
vaccine
mandates
in
nine
cities
found
no
significant
impacts
on
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake,
cases
or
deaths.

Lawmakers
should
act
to
protect
the
rights
of
Maine’s
youth,
and
ensure
students
are
never
again
treated
like
they
were
for
their
choices
regarding
the
COVID-19
vaccine.
Please
deem
LD
869,
LD
1148,
and
LD
1228
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
restore
respect
for
bodily
autonomy
in
Maine
law.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
