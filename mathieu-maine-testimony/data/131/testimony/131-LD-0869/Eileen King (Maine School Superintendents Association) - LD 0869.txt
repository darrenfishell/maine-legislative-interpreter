AN ACT TO PROTECT ED UCATION ACCESS BY PROHIBITING A MANDATE 
FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN FOR A COVID -19 VACCINE OR A V ACCINE

Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. I am Eileen King, executive director of Maine School Superin-
tendents Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine 
School Superintendents Association neither for nor against L.D. 869.  
 
There are immunizations, as you know that are required under a joint rule issued by 
the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Department of 
Education. They are designed to keep students safe. That rule currently covers im-
munizations for Diptheria, Measles, Meningococcal Meningitis, Mumps, Pertussis, 
Poliomyelitis Tetanus, Rubella, and Varicella. There already are medical exemptions 
and philosophical or religious exemptions in law, Title 20 -A, section 6355.  
 
Covid vaccinations are not required in schools. We are neither for nor against this 
legislation because while we don ’t want to mandate the vaccine, we believe Covid 
vaccinations can help prevent illness or the severity of illness for those who contract 
the virus.
