LD 869 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational & Cultural Affairs 
Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 869.  
LD 869 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable.  
It would prevent rules from including vaccines approved solely under emergency use. This is 
contrary to accepted science and introduces an unnecessary barrier to emergency response. It 
also specifically prohibits rules which reference COVID-19, which clearly labels this as a 
political issue and not one of public health.  
In the event of an emergency, the needs of public health demand that there be no barriers to 
emergency measures. Vaccines approved under emergency use help to prevent deaths.  
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
