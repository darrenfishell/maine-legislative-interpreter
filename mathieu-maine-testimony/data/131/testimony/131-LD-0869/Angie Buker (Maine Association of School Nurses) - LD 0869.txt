 Testimony of the Maine Association of School Nurses in Opposition of 
 LD 869 “An Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting a Mandate 
 for Schoolchildren for a COVID-19 Vaccine or a Vaccine Under an 
 Emergency Use Authorization”. 
 Angie Buker, MSN, RN, NCSN 
 President, Maine Association of School Nurses 
 abuker@aos94.org 
 Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan and distinguished members of 
 the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee:  My name is Angie Buker and I 
 am president of the Maine Association of School Nurses (MASN) and a 
 member of the National Association of School Nurses. MASN represents 
 more than half of Maine’s Pre K-12 school nurses.  Our mission is to optimize 
 student health and learning by advancing the practice of school nursing. 
 MASN has reviewed the above proposed legislation and has concluded that 
 we cannot support LD 869 “An Act to Protect Education Access by Prohibiting 
 a Mandate for Schoolchildren for a COVID-19 Vaccine or a Vaccine Under an 
 Emergency Use Authorization”. 
 NASN and MASN support the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
 Practices (ACIP) vaccine recommendations that are adopted by the Centers 
 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is necessary that school nurses 
 and primary care providers alike rely on the latest evidence provided by 
 agencies such as Maine CDC, and the Maine Department of Health and 
 Human Services for the most evidence-based information to guide 
 parent/guardian decisions. There are also times when school boards and 
 municipalities may have a legitimate need for more stringent vaccination 
 policies per the advice of the Maine CDC.  Maine is becoming a more diverse 
 state every day and the health care needs of individual municipalities and 
 districts may vary. 
 For these reasons, MASN urges the committee to vote  Ought Not to Pass 
 on LD 869.  Thank you for listening to the concerns of MASN as we strive to 
 keep our students healthy and in the classroom as well as support parents 
 making the best healthcare decisions for their children.
