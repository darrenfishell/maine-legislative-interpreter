Chairman Rafferty and Committee Members,
The Maine legislature has a moral, ethical and possibly legal obligation to ensure that 
people are not forced to submit to an intervention that has the potential to cause more 
harm than good.
One of the injuries to young people includes severe lung injury. We know this but it 
isn't being readily reported as they are trying to hide the adverse effects happening. 
But I saw one injury first hand....... The pitcher on my daughter's softball team was 
carried off in an ambulance during a game. She couldn't breathe. She was hospitalized
for a few days with spontaneous pleural effusion (inflammation of lining of lungs).  
She had been vaccinated a few weeks prior with covid vaccine. Doctors don't know 
yet if she has any long-term damage or consequences. 
Bottom line is that we DO NOT KNOW the long-term effects of this vaccine. By 
definition it's not even a vaccine, it's gene therapy.
But there is every reason to believe there will be significant immune system 
dysregulation namely autoimmune diseases.
 
We know that people under the age of 50 have very little risk from covid. According 
to the CDC survival rates for coronavirus are:
0-19 yrs -   99.997%
20-49 yrs -  9998%
50-69 yrs - 99.5%
70+ yrs -  94.6%
 
And this is without treatment.
The Surgeon General has announced on national television that the vaccine will not 
stop transmission of the virus so what is the
benefit?
The Maine legislature has a moral, ethical and possibly legal obligation to ensure that 
people are not forced to submit to an intervention that has the potential to cause more 
harm than good.
Please support the bill to prohibit mandatory covid 19 injections for all students.
