Befor e
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government
Good
morning
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover
and
honorable
members
of
the
State
and 
Local
Government
Committee.
My
name
is
Sophie
W arren,
and
I
represent
House
district
124, 
which
includes
coastal
Scarborough.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
present
LD
671,
An
Act 
to
Factor
Conservative
Pr ojections
of
Sea
Level
Rise
into
State
Planning
on
Climate 
Change
.
In
2019,
The
Inter governmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
(IPCC),
which
is
the
United
Nations 
body
for
assessing
the
science
related
to
climate
change,
released
a
report
that
details
the
ways
in 
which
the
ocean
and
cryosphere
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
impacted
by
climate
change.
According
to
the
report,
global
mean
sea
level
is
rising,
with
acceleration
in
recent
decades
due 
to
increasing
rates
of
ice
loss
from
the
Greenland
and
Antarctic
ice
sheets,
as
well
as
continued 
glacier
mass
loss
and
ocean
thermal
expansion.
Coastal
ecosystems
are
af fected
by
ocean 
warming,
including
intensified
marine
heatwaves,
acidification,
loss
of
oxygen,
salinity
intrusion 
and
sea
level
rise,
in
combination
with
adverse
ef fects
from
human
activities
on
ocean
and
land.
According
to
the
Maine
Climate
Council
,
Maine
has
already
experienced
eight
inches
of
sea 
level
rise.
Expectations
for
future
sea
level
rise
in
Maine
are
1.5
more
feet
by
2050
and
4
more 
feet
by
2100.
One
foot
of
sea
level
rise
increases
nuisance
flooding
over
15
times,
which
will 
af fect
Maine’ s
entire
coast
and
tidal
rivers,
causing
erosion
in
coastal
beaches,
dunes,
salt 
marshes
and
bluf fs,
coastal
groundwater
contamination,
and
loss
of
40
-
75%
of
dry
beach
area.
As
we
review
the
first
report
of
the
Maine
Climate
Council
in
2020,
and
anticipate
the
second
in 
2024,
now
seems
a
prudent
time
to
consider
ways
we
can
plan
for
the
dynamic
nature
of 
Sea-Level
Rise
projections
as
they
shift
to
allow
our
state
agencies
and
municipalities
to
plan
for 
updates
and
the
associated
costs.
Based
in
part
on
the
recommendations
of
the
Scientific
Assessment
of
Climate
Change
and
its 
Ef fects
in
Maine,
published
in
2020
by
the
Maine
Climate
Council’ s
Scientific
and
T echnical 
Subcommittee,
the
legislature
passed
LD
1572
in
2021.
This
bill
required
a
number
of
agencies 
to
report
back
on
which
of
their
programs
and
rules
needed
to
be
updated
to
account
for
the
sea 
level
rise
(SLR)
recommendations
from
the
climate
action
plan.
The
language
of
LD
1572,
and 
associated
legislation
on
sea-level
rise,
adopted
the
1.5
ft
projection
by
2050.
As
seen
on
Page
D i s t r i c t
1 2 4 :
P a r t
o f
S c a r b o r o u g h

105
of
the
Assessment,
there
was
both
a
likely
projection
of
1.5
ft
and
a
recommendation
for 
consideration
of
the
more
conservative
metric
of
3
ft
by
2050.
As
it
is
relevant
to
this
bill,
the
subcommittee
recommendations
here
acknowledge
the
likelihood 
of
evolving
data
that
is
subject
to
change
with
time.
For
example,
by
the
time
of
the
next
council 
report
in
2024,
those
projections
may
even
be
likely
to
shift
closer
to
1.8
ft
or
higher
(if
IPCC 
reports
are
a
likely
indicator
here).
This
bill
as
proposed
by
Sponsor
Amendment
submitted
to
this
Committee
on
March
10th 
proposes
two
periodic
measures
to
address
the
dynamic
nature
of
SLR
projections
and
assist 
future
legislators
to
make
appropriate
planning
decisions
based
on
the
work
of
the
Maine 
Climate
Council:
This
section
is
based
on
LD
1572
passed
in
2021:
Every
four
years,
the
Maine
Climate
Council 
will
report
to
the
committee
of
jurisdiction
the
likely
projections
of
sea
level
rise.
The 
Committee
of
jurisdiction
will
be
given
the
opportunity
to
submit
legislation
based
on
that
report 
to
required
a
number
of
agencies
to
report
back
on
which
of
their
programs
and
rules
needed
to 
be
updated
to
account
for
the
sea
level
rise
(SLR)
recommendations.
This
section
is
based
on
LD
563
passed
in
2019:
Every
four
years,
the
Maine
Climate
Council 
will
report
to
the
committee
of
jurisdiction
over
the
State’ s
growth
management
and
local 
land-use
planning
requirements
(at
T itle
30-A,
Chapter
187
of
the
Maine
Code;
and
T itle
30-A, 
Section
4326
of
the
Maine
Statutes).
The
Committee
of
jurisdiction
will
be
given
the 
opportunity
to
submit
legislation
based
on
that
report
to
allow
for
revised
recommendations
of 
likely
sea-level
rise
projections
for
municipal
planning
purposes
of
the
ef fects
of
sea-level
rise 
(SLR).
I
am
hopeful
with
this
bill
to
see
that
as
future
Climate
Council
reports
come
out
in
their 
statutory
four
year
cycles,
that
we
have
integrated
recommendations
to
specific
Legislative 
Committees
with
regular
and
consistent
action
items
that
give
potential
policy-focused 
recommendations
to
policy
makers
which
are
scientifically
informed
and
timely
as
the
realities 
of
climate
change
shift,
compound
and
unfold.
As
someone
who
represents
a
coastal
community ,
there
exists
fear
and
uncertainty
felt
by
my 
neighbors,
especially
those
who
worry
about
flooding,
storm
sur ges,
delicate
beach
and
marsh 
ecosystems,
and
even
displacement
due
to
rising
sea
levels.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
of
how
we
can
continue
and
further
our
ef forts
to 
address
climate
change.
I
am
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
you
have.
