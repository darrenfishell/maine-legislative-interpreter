Since putting in this bill, I have learned from the Secretary of State that the objectives of this bill 
have been accomplished by the new medical rules being put in place by the Maine Bureau of 
Motor Vehicles. This legislation is no longer needed. I want to thank the Secretary of State and 
her staff for the work on these new rules. I ask that the committee move ought not to pass on this 
bill. Thank you.
