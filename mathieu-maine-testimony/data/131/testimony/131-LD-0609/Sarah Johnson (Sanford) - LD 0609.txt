Testimony of Sarah Johnson
 IN SUPPORT OF LD 609   
 An Act to Ensure an Incarcerated Individual's Right to Make Free Telephone Calls 
Protected by Attorney-Client Privilege
Presented by Representative Hasenfus of Readfield
Before the Judiciary Committee, April 19, 2023 
 
Representative Hasenfus and Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Sarah Johnson.  I am a Software Support Specialist and I live in Sanford. 
I am a former volunteer instructor in York County and MDOC (17 years) and I 
recently worked in the education department for at the WNMCF in Grants, NM for 4 
years. 
I am writing to ask for your support of LD 609 simply based on the need for integrity 
in the correctional system. Every person should have the right to consult privately 
with their attorney. Any stand less than that jeopardizes all other rights afforded to all 
of us for privacy protection and representation and allows for the assumption of 
systemic corruption. 
Thank you for your consideration of support for LD609.
Sarah Johnson
