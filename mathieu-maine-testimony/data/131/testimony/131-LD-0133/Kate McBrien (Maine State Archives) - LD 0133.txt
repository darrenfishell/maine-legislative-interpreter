LD 133, “An Act to Include a Representative of Newspaper

Testimony Provided by Kate McBrz' en, Maine State Archivist 
January 3], 2023 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government: 
My name is Kate McBrien. I am a resident of Union and I serve as the Maine State 
Archivist. The Maine‘ State Archives fully supports LD 133 and welcomes the 
opportunity to add a member of the press to our Archives Advisory Board. 
The Archives Advisory Board already consists of nine skilled and dedicated 
professionals, each bringing their own unique expertise to the advisory role of the Board. 
The Board members represent important perspectives, such as legal, ﬁnancial, local 
government, historical, and state agency viewpoints. Their review and input greatly 
support the Archives ’ ability to develop and approve retention schedules for state records. 
The Maine State Archives seeks to add a member with a newspaper or other press interest 
to ensure public and press needs for information are met, so that State government can be 
appropriately transparent to all who have an interest. This addition to our Archives 
Advisory Board membership will greatly assist the Maine State Archives to serve the 
people of Maine. 
I thank you for your consideration and am available to answer any questions.
