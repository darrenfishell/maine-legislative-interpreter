 Testimony of  Maine Press Association  Honorable Tim Nangle, Senate Chair  Honorable Holly Stover, House Chair  Joint Committee on State and Local Government January 27, 2023 RE: LD 133, An Act to Include a Representative of Newspaper and Other Press Interests on the Archives Advisory Board Dear Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Members of  the Joint Committee on State and Local Government: The Maine Press Association supports this legislation. Comprising 43 print newspapers and digital news sites across the state, the MPA advocates for the interests of  open and transparent government. The Archives Advisory Board provides guidance to the State Archivist for retention schedules for public records maintained by state and local government, including municipalities, counties, schools, and special districts. Its work affects public access to governmental records, both now and decades — even centuries — into the future.  The Maine Press Association, founded in 1864, is one of  the oldest professional news organizations in the nation. Our goals include promoting and protecting the public’s right to know. While the Archives Advisory Board currently has two appointed members representing the interests of  public access to government records, the MPA supports adding a member who will represent news and media interests. This addition, we believe, will provide essential ‘Right to Know’ perspective, and be beneﬁcial to the Advisory Board. Thank you for your time and consideration, Maine Press Association Legislative Committee: Lynda Clancy, Editorial Director, Penobscot Bay Pilot Joe Charpentier, Lewiston Sun Journal  David Dahl, Editor, Maine Monitor Jodi Jalbert, Publisher, Sun Media Group Dan McLeod, Managing Editor, Bangor Daily News Judith Meyer, Executive Editor, Sun Journal, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel Marian McCue, Editor, Portland Phoenix Courtney Spencer, VP of  Advertising, Portland Press Herald Maia Zewert, Editor, Lincoln County News
