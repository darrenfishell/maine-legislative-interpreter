Testimony of Senator Mattie Daughtry introducing
LD 716, An Act to Assist Nonprofit Service Providers
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary
March 22, 2023
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Esteemed Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Mattie Daughtry, and I proudly represent Senate District 
23, which includes Brunswick, Freeport, Harpswell, Pownal, Chebeague Island, and part of 
Yarmouth. Today I am pleased to introduce my bill LD 716, “An Act to Assist Nonprofit Service 
Providers.”
Late last year, the Maine Association of Nonprofits (MANP) requested that I submit a 
placeholder concept draft – LD 716 – that could potentially develop into a bill that would 
improve contracting practices between the State of Maine, especially the Governor’s Office, and 
nonprofits. 
Since then, the Governor’s Office has been meeting with MANP and discussing some of the 
concerns with current contracting practices including late payments and unreasonably low 
allowances for administrative expenses. It’s my understanding that the Governor’s Office and 
MANP, in additional to engaging in discussions, will be convening a stakeholder group to study 
these issues – and more – and then identify areas for resolution. 
Having reached this point, I feel confident that we do not need to use this concept draft. I want to 
thank the Governor’s Office and MANP for making progress on this issue, independently of a 
legislative directive. I would ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 716.
I thank you for your time, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
