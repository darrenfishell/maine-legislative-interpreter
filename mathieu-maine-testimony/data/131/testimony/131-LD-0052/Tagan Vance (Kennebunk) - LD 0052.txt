Tagan Vance
Kennebunk
LD 52
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
Education &amp; Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Tagan Vance and I am a 
resident of Kennebunk – one of Senator Rafferty’s constituents. I am also a student at 
USM, about to enter into my final year, studying Elementary Education. I am opposed
to LD 52, which pre-supposes that school employees actually want to carry firearms. 
As a future teacher, I am frightened by the thought of my fellow faculty members 
carrying firearms within the school. The idea makes me question whether or not I am 
willing to become a teacher here in this state.
