Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 52 
An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms on School Property 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee: 
 
My name is Sandy Lovell, I live in Portland, and I have two grandchildren who attend 
Longfellow Elementary School in Portland. I also volunteer in an elementary school 
classroom once or twice a week.  
 
There are studies, stories and statistics about the ineffectiveness and unintended dangers 
of arming teachers. I will not cite any of that. All I want to do is be one more rational voice 
asking you to oppose L.D. 52.  
 
If we continue to tell the story that our schools are not safe by having guns on site, the 
learning environment changes. Not only the teachers, administrators and staff will know 
it, but the children will know it/feel it as well. If this is not the world we want for our 
children and grandchildren, then let’s not create it.  
 
Let’s support schools to put their full attention on creating a vibrant learning 
environment without distractions or fear. Let’s keep guns out of schools. Period. 
 
Please vote out not to pass L.D. 52.
