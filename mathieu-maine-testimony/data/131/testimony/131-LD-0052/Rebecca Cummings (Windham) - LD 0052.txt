LD 52
I write in support of LD52. I SUPPORT ANY LEGISLATION WHICH ALLOWS 
PROPERLY TRAINED PERSONNEL TO PROVIDED ARMED SECURITY ON 
SCHOOL PREMISES. 
I also support any legislation which prosecutes individuals who weaken 
school/campus security (e.g. forget to lock doors, failure to repair non-op equipment, 
prop doors open, etc.).
