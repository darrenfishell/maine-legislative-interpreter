LD 52
To the distinguished members of the Education committee,
I am writing today to express my opposition to LD 52. I oppose creating any 
exemption from the prohibition on guns on public or private school grounds.
I have worked in schools and don’t find it smart to militarize our schools. It’s guns 
that are killing kids. More guns in schools is not the answer to the gun problem in our 
country.
Please vote against this bill.
Thank you,
