Republican Cory Reynolds 
LD 52
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, My Name is Cory Reynolds and I am in 
support for LD- 52 -  An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms 
on School Property. I am Saddened to keep hearing of all the school shootings around
the country. these could be prevented i we stopped the criminals from running our 
streets. I believe what we need to do when a situation like this occurs though is to 
have to allow certain school employees that are trained to use a gun. I believe if we do
this it can save a life. We Need to Remember all these school shootings are happening
at a building that is Gun Free Zone,  so I please ask you to vote in support of LD - 52. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
