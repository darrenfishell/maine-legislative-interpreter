www.maineaap.org  Testimony in O pposition  to LD 52: “An Act to Allow Certain 
School Employees to Carry Firearms on School Property .” 
Senator R afferty, Representative Brennan,  and dis tinguished 
members of the Educa tion and Cultural Aff airs Committee, I am D r. 
Dan Hale of Kittery, Maine and a Board Member of the Maine AAP. . 
As a father, pediatrician, and responsible firearm owner I support 
commonsense measures to prevent firearm violence. There is no 
“easy” unifying intervention that will end firearm violence, but there 
are several measures that can move us in the right direc tion of 
saving lives. 
However, LD 52 does not add value as an attempt to keep our 
schools safe.  
I feel  this bill should not pass  because  unsecured firearms on school 
property have been documented to lead to accidental shootings.  In 
addition, in an active shooter situation, an armed person may be at 
risk of being shot by responding police officers who cannot tell who 
the “good guy” is  and who the “bad guy”  is. 
Finally, arming teachers overall would not be effective because a 
teacher would not have the training to effectively coordinate the 
protection  of students and confront an active shooter situation. 
Teachers should focus on getting students to safety while 
appropriate law enforcement personnel secure the scene.  
There is a long history of responsible firearm ownership in Main e. 
Families have been hunting and fishing together for centuries. The 
legislature should focus on measures that strengthen safety 
measures without causing potential inadvertent harm.  
Thank you for keeping our communities safe,  
Dan Hale, M.D.,  FAAP, SFHM
