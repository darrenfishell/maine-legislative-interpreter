LD 52
Please save our schools by not passing and allowing guns in schools. This will only 
hurt our schools and as an educator, most teachers I know do not support this AND do
not want to carry a gun. I know if teachers carried guns is my school, I would 
consider leaving the profession. I would not feel comfortable at all and it has been 
proven time and time again that it is NOT more safe.
LD 52, LD 518, LD 1326, and LD 1557 should not pass.  They are a danger to our 
schools and our community. More guns are not the answer.
