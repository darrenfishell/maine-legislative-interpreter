LD 52
I am a mother and grandmother speaking out on behalf of my children and 
grandchildren. Having more firearms in schools is NOT a solution to the epidemic of 
gun violence in our country, and I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to this legislation 
(LD52). More guns will only increase the potential for more violence and trauma for 
students, parents and teachers -- This is WRONG!
