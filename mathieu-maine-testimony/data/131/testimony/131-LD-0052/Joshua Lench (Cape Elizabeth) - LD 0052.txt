Honorable
Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
of
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs,
My
name
is
Joshua
Lench
and
I’m
a
senior
at
Cape
Elizabeth
High
School.
This
testimony
is
in
reference
to
LD
52
and
1557.
Firstly ,
I
want
to
thank
those
of
you
who
have
supported
legislation
for
your
initiative
to
address
the
issue
of
school
safety
in
relation
to
firearms.
However ,
as
a
student,
the
idea
of
arming
my
teachers
is
quite
alarming.
The
presence
of
a
firearm
in
any
location
is
conducive
to
tension
and
even
fear ,
and
fear
is
not
helpful
in
a
learning
environment.
Fighting
the
fear
of
active
shooters
in
schools
with
more
fear
is
not
a
good
option.
Instead,
regulated
gun
commerce
and
control
is
more
favorable.
Stronger
background
checks
to
obtain
a
firearm
is
the
way
to
prevent
the
tragic
events
that
have
become
more
and
more
frequent.
Instead
of
fighting
fear
with
fear ,
let’ s
fight
it
with
reason.
Thank
you
