Dear Maine Committee on Edu and  Cultural Affairs
I am very concerned about a bill that I believe your committee will be considering 
soon, LD 52, which allows certain employees to carry weapons in schools.  I was a 
classroom teacher in Portland for 20 years and retired recently.  I think LD 52 is a 
very bad idea.  All the studies I have read said that one is more likely to be injured or 
killed when “defense weapons” are brought into homes or workplaces.  I cannot 
imagine how a teacher or administrator could ever defend a classroom of children or 
colleagues while an active shooter would be in a school.  Where would the weapon be
stored?  How quickly could a person using it for defense unlock the gun from storage,
load it, and fire it?  My father had hunting rifles when I was growing up, but I see NO
PLACE in SCHOOLS for guns.
We have more guns in the U. S. than citizens.  Are we safe yet?   Do more guns make 
us safer?  The answer is no.
Sincerely,
Linda Stimpson
Portland, Maine
