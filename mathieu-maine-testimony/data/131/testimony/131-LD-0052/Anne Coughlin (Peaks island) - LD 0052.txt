LD 52
Iam writing to oppose LD 52.   I know “personal stories” are vital to humanize issues 
before the legislature.  However My goal is to raise awareness of two important facts.
Both are taken from an analysis of existing research into gun policy in America, 
published by the Rand Corporation, and updated in January 2023. 
First:  “most students killed with firearms are shot in their own homes, typically 
because of domestic disputes, accidental or negligent discharge of guns, or suicide.”  
Research published in 2019 found that only 1.2 percent of youth homicides and 0.2 
percent of youth suicide take place on school property. 
Second:  although 28 states already allowed schools to arm teachers or staff (other 
than guards or peace officers)as of 2021, analysts could find NO studies that showed 
these laws either INCREASED or DECREASED mass shootings, suicides, or 
unintentional injuries and deaths.   Good headlines, easy political mobilization….but 
no measurable impact!
I urge the legislature to focus its attention on actions and investments that will 
actually reduce firearm deaths in Maine.    Thank you.
