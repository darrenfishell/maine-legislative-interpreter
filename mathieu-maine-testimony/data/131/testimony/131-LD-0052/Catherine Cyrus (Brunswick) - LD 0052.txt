LD 52
I believe that allowing guns to be brought into the school environment is madness.  
More guns in more hands – trained or not - mean more guns being used (intentionally 
or by mistake) and more ruined lives and deaths.    I am not a statistician but it’s my 
understanding that the countries who have strict regulation of firearms have fewer gun
tragedies.  Our job as a civil society is to take weapons of war out of our communities
and to put reasonable regulation on the sale and availability of guns used for hunting 
or so called recreational and law enforcement purposes.   Please use your voice and 
leadership to vote against LD 52; LD 518 and LD 1557.
