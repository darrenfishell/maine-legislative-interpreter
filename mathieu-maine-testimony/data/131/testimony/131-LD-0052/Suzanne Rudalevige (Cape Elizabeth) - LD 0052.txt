Testimony for the 131st Session of the Maine Legislature 
 Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
 
Public Hearing: April 26, 2023 
 
 LD 52: An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms 
on School Property 
 
Chairperson Senator Joseph Rafferty and Representative Michael Brennan 
and Members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige and I 
live in Cape Elizabeth.  
 
I strongly oppose this bill. I do not believe that having a policy of allowing 
guns on school property contributes to the safety of the children and staff. 
The data is clear that the mere presence of a gun provides a risk to those 
whom it is meant to protect.  
Moreover, the teachers and staff at a school are there to give their full 
attention to educating the pupils. The school board also has its focus on 
educational planning and policy and should not be burdened with this task 
of providing standards and training and supervising gun possession on 
school property.  
 Please do not allow school employees to carry guns on school property. 
 Thank you.
