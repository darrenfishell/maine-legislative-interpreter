Thank you to the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee for reading my 
testimony. I am a mother, wife, active community member, voter, and school 
employee. My husband and sons hunt and our family does own guns. I understand the
urge to do something to protect our children and school staff from mass shootings and
other forms of violence at school. However, I resist the urge to fight violence with 
more guns. More access to weapons is not the answer to this complex issue. More 
guns in school will allow more access to guns and more opportunity for gun related 
violence. The US Secret Service document analyzing school violence points out that 
access to firearms is one of the determinants of school violence occurring. This 
document and many others note that safe, nurturing school and communities are the 
greatest protective factors. Sensible laws like: gun storage requirements; age limits on
gun purchasing, background checks, extreme risk laws, and reducing access to 
semiautomatic weapons are a big piece of the puzzle. And equally important is the 
need to increase in student supports like: more school support staff like guidance and 
social work staff, better training for staff on how to assess risk and best intervene, 
restorative justice practices; anonymous reporting of treats, and a detailed treat 
assessment process. Children are not criminals, children are struggling and suffering 
and it is the school’s role to provide a safe and nurturing environment to learn. Let’s 
focus on how to improve our schools, meet the needs of students and families in our 
communities, and reduce access to guns as the proven and most effective ways to 
increase safety and educate our next generation for a brighter future.
