I am writing OPPOSED to this bill.  I am a former teacher and currently work at a 
university to prepare teachers.  Bringing more guns into schools, even with certain 
safeguards, will not make schools safer.  It only increases the chances of an accidental
shooting.  We have seen countless examples of "a good guy with a gun" not working 
including in situations in schools with trained professionals who carry a gun.  I am 
FIRMLY against this bill passing.
