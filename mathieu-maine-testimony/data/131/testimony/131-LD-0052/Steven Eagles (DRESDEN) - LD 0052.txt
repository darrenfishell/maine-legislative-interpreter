In opposition to LD 52 
Greetings members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
My name is Steve Eagles and I ask that you vote not to pass LD 52, An act to allow 
Armed certain school employees to carry firearms on School Property.  All 3 of my 
children attended public school in Richmond, K-12 and I did NOT fear for their safety
when NO firearms were permitted on school grounds.  I would have feared for their 
safety had I known that firearms were permitted on school grounds.  As we know, 
guns do not kill people but if there are no guns present, no person will be able to use 
it.
I am also a long term Unitarian Universalist and am active in our denominational 
political action arm known as Maine Unitarian- Universalist State Advocacy 
Network.  As a believer in the democratic process and the power of Love, we do not 
believe that problems can be solved by the use of force.  Recent events have shown 
the futility of trained and armed police being available at schools.  In one situation the
armed person fled when an armed person arrived, in another instance there were 
armed and trained individuals who stood outside a classroom while shots were being 
fired.  Please do not believe that a committed and potentially deranged shooter can be 
stopped by having armed people on site.
I believe that, on occasion, a trained professional law enforcement official has 
mistakenly shot an innocent person and I do believe a misplaced or mishandled 
firearm is a much higher risk to our children than a potential shooter entering Maine 
public schools. 
Thank you for you work,
Steven Eagles
