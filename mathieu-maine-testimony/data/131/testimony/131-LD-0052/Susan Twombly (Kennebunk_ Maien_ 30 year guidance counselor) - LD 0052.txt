Dear Committee Members,
       As a retired high school guidance counselor, I am appalled that you are even 
considering allowing guns in schools.  This will not protect students and teachers; it 
will put them more at risk.   Who would be responsible for checking if those who 
volunteer would not be shooters themselves, or that they might become rattled and 
shoot?  How do students and teachers continue to do their jobs and feel safe if they 
suspect that someone is carrying a gun?  How do we keep guns out of the hands of 
our youth, and what lesson does this teach them?  That violence is the cure for 
violence?  If there are guns in the schools, students will have access to them.  I have 
had students die by suicide and be killed by a gun, but never in the school because 
guns were not in the schools.  I have also had at least one student who got into a 
locked file cabinet to steal a teacher's credit card.  If guns are in the school, students 
will get hold of them just as they do at home.
     Investing in security measures for all schools is a more rational solution.  At Old 
Orchard Beach High School and Massabesic High School, there was a policeman 
assigned to the school who not only served as a safety officer, but, in both cases, was 
involved in working with at-risk students.  This seems like a better investment in 
securing the safety of our students.
     Please do not be swayed by the interest of a highly financed interest group but 
listen to your teachers and students.  I loved my job, but I would not be able to work 
with the pressure of guns in schools.  For the safety and well being of our students 
and dedicated staff, please do not approve the measures to allow guns in school.
