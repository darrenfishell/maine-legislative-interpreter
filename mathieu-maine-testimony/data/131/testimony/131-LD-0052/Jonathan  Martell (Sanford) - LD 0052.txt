LD 52 - An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms on School Property 
  
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  April 26, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Education and Cultural Affairs.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 52 - An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms on School Property 
 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 52 - An Act to Allow Certain School 
Employees to Carry Firearms on School Property. 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
School shootings have been an issue since they were made into gun free zones in 1990. Title XVII, Section 
1702, of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, makes it 
illegal for any individual to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone. 
 
Clearly, the opposite of the intended effect has happened since we now hear of school shootings in various parts 
of the country Maine is the safest state in the country, except for our schools where everyone but possibly a 
School Resource Officer that may or may not be at a school based on funding and other factors. 
 
While I would like to see Gun Free Zones go away completely, this is a good first step in allowing teachers and 
other staff to be armed with suitable training  
 
 
Please support this bill as we need to better protect our children.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell
