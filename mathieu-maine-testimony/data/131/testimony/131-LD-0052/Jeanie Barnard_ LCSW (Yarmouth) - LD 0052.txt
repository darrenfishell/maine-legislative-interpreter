Dear Committee Members:
I write in strong opposition to this bill. First, as a psychotherapist with over 40 years 
of experience and having worked with many teachers over the years this bill shows a 
complete lack of understanding of what school employees want and need. They want 
and need respect, supplies, a living wage, and help with keeping guns out of schools, 
not asking them to add police work to their already difficult jobs, I can almost 
guarantee you that  arming teachers will drive more teachers, and probably others 
from the profession. In addition, there is no data that shows that arming teachers and 
other school personnel will keep anyone safer. Thank you
