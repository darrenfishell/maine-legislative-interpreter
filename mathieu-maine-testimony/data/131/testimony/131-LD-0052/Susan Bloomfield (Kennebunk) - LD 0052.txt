LD 52
Good day, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education 
& Cultural Affairs Committee. I am a resident of Kennebunk. I am opposed to LD 52.
My great concern is the bill’s flawed logic. As written, the  school employee possess 
or discharges a firearm “for the purpose of enhancing the safety and security of the 
school and in defense of students, staff and members of the public on the school 
premises.” Yet “the bill provides that the school employee is not authorized to 
exercise law enforcement powers.” ???
Enhancing the safety and security of the school and in defense of students, staff and 
members of the public is EXACTLY the definition of law enforcement powers.
See this for what it is, adding more weaponry in and around schools. Leave the 
teachers and administrators out if this and rely on trained law enforcement officials, if
need be.
