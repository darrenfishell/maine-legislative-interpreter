LD 52
I support LD 52 “An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry Firearms on 
School Property”, LD 518 “An Act to Allow Armed Security in Schools”, LD 1557 
“An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing Individuals with 
Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on School Property”, and LD 1326 
“An Act to Increase School Security Through Design and Protocol”.
By allowing permitted law-abiding Mainers to carry concealed firearms on school 
property, these bills will deter violent criminals by eliminating gun-free zones at 
Maine schools. Additionally, LD 1326 will look to ensure all entry points such as 
those that recent school shooters have used to gain entry into our children’s schools, 
are closed.
As we’ve seen time and time again throughout history, gun-free zones create soft 
targets for violent criminals. These areas are frequently targeted by criminals who 
seek to inflict as much damage as possible, because they know that there will be little,
or no, resistance. Because of this, gun-free zones create major vulnerabilities for 
students and staff at facilities throughout Maine and the nation. These are facts.
 We must find solutions that recognize law-abiding gun owners’ Second Amendment 
rights on school grounds, in order to deter violent criminals, and protect students, 
teachers, and parents, both during school hours and during extracurricular activities.
Again, I support LD 52 “An Act to Allow Certain School Employees to Carry 
Firearms on School Property”, LD 518 “An Act to Allow Armed Security in 
Schools”, LD 1557 “An Act to Increase and Enhance School Safety by Allowing 
Individuals with Concealed Carry Permits to Possess Handguns on School Property”, 
and LD 1326 “An Act to Increase School Security Through Design and Protocol”, 
and they “ought to pass”.
