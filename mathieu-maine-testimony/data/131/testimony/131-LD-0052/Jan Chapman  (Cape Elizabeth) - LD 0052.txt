There is no question we need to make school safer from gun violence but arming 
school personnel will not achieve that goal. Keeping guns out of the hands of people 
who shouldn't have them would be a far more effective approach. We should enact 
extreme risk laws that allow family members and law enforcement to intervene when 
a person is in crisis and considering harming themselves or others. Please oppose 
LD52.
