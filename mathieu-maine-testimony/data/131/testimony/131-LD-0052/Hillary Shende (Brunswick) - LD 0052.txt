Hillary Shende
Brunswick
LD 52
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennen, and esteeemed members of the Education 
and Cultural Affairs Commitee, My name is Hillary Shende, and I am here to testify 
against LD 52.
The most important thing you need to know about this bill is whether the presence of 
firearms  - in any circumstance - actually makes people safer from violence or not. 
And despite some folks’ claims that you can find a study that proves anything you 
want, this simply isn’t true.  There are scientifically sound studies, and there are 
flawed studies. And the scientifically sound studies are the ones that speak truth. In 
every case, the scientifically sound studies have all found the same thing: the presence
of firearms in any location makes that location LESS safe, not MORE safe, from gun 
violence. Studies published by The American Academy of Physicians, the Oxford 
University Press, The National Institutes of Health, Scientific American, the Rand 
Corporation, Harvard University, the journal Nature, the New England Journal of 
Medicine, Boston University, The Kaiser Family Foundation and many others all 
concluded that the presence of firearms significantly INCREASES the risk that people
in that vicinity will experience gun violence. 
So the facts are clear. If you vote for this bill, you are voting to increase the likelihood
of gun violence in Maine schools. Period.
So please vote against it.
Thanks for your time.
