Committee   
This bill (LD 122) is sadly just another example of how little regard elected officials have 
towards the citizens they are supposed to represent. Are you kidding? Are you not aware of 
what the energy costs are? 
    Take a look at where Efficiency Maine Trust get their money:
       
      Regional GreenHouse Initiative ($38,180,638)= CARBON TAX PASSED ON TO 
RATEPAYERS
Electric Efficiency Procurement ($68,007,029)= DIRECT TAX ON RATEPAYER BILLS @ 4 
% of BILL   
         
Maine Power Reliability Program Settlement ($645,827)= MONEY FROM CMP'S 
TRANSMISSION PROJECT DIRECTED TO EMT, NOT RATEPAYERS
Forward Capacity Market ($1,536,087)= MONEY MADE FROM AN ISO-NE 
DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM THAT PAYS FOR REDUCING NEED OF 
GENERATION SUPPLY. RATEPAYERS PAY AGAIN
FCM Heat Pump Initiative ($14,097,416)= ANOTHER ISO-NE FORWARD 
CAPACITY PROGRAM PAID BY RATEPAYERS
Natural Gas Efficiency Procurement($2,660,172)= TAX ON NATURAL GAS 
CUSTOMER BILLS
Energy Efficiency & Renewable Resource Fund($414,637)= A PROGRAM 
FUNDED BY VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
Agricultural Fairs($524,480) = MONEY FROM ASSESSMENTS ON UTILITIES 
(RATEPAYER MONEY AGAIN)
VW Settlement Funds($4,903,734)= PENALTY GIVEN VW FOR FAKING AUTO 
EMISSION TESTS 
NECEC Settlement Funds($6,857,919)= MONEY FROM THE STIPULATION 
AGREEMENT ARRANGED DURING THE PUC DELIBERATIONS OF NECEC
American Rescue Funds($18,000,000) = PART OF THE $ 50 MILLION 
TAXPAYER DOLLARS GIVEN TO EMT
LD 1955 Funds($3,500,000)= ?????????
Revolving Loan Funds($950,100)= INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EMT LOAN 
DEPARTMENT
FY 2023 TOTAL BUDGET =   $165,012,542.00 ( MOSTLY RATEPAYER 
MONEY)  
    The State's program to reach zero carbon is futile as evidenced by the uptick in 
carbon emissions in the electric sector over the past 3 years. (RGGI Data)
    All New England States served by ISO-NE have seen an uptick in natural gas and 
oil use to generate electricity for the past 3 years( EIA Data)
    Electricity Supply Prices have nearly tripled over the past 3 years.
   What will it take to convince the lawmakers that the policies undertaken will not 
work?
   It is past time to rethink this renewable thing. A colleague of mine, very adept at 
mathematics, extrapolated the data from the past 3 years and concluded it would take 
100 years to get to 50% renewables. 100 YEARS!!  and Trillions of Ratepayer 
money!!
   It is time to stop all this madness immediately and get a plan to reality.
