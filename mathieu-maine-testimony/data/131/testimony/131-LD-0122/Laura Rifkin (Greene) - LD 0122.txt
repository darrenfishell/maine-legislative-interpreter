Dear committee:
Thank you for accepting my testimony to support zero emission transportation options. I 
sincerely hope that you will include any purchase of any class e-bike for a rebate.  Not only 
does an e-bike offer an excellent short distance errand or to work option, but encourages our 
aging population an opportunity to stay in shape.  Our state should be ENCOURAGING our 
population to purchase e-bikes ..  I am a 71 year old person with bi-lateral knee 
replacements.  Without my e-bike, I would not be able to ride and enjoy doing errands while 
getting exercise.  I certainly hope you will support including e-bikes for a rebate as a no 
emission vehicle.
