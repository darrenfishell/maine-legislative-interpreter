Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1085:
“An
Act
to
Increase
Transparency
of
and
Lower
Health
Care
Costs”
Senator
Bailey,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
Coverage,
Insurance
and
Financial
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1085.
In
2017,
Maine
Policy
Institute
worked
hard
to
ensure
passage
of
Maine’s
Right-To-Shop
law
so
that
Mainers
could
better
understand
costs
of
medical
procedures.
1
LD
1085
would
continue
that
important
mission
by
allowing
more
Maine
health
insurance
customers
in
small
group
plans
access
to
price
transparency
tools
and
by
putting
in
place
more
potent
incentives
for
consumers
to
make
use
of
cost-savings.
Including
surgeries
in
the
definition
of
“comparable
health
services”
will
provide
clearer
price
information
for
patients
across
Maine
seeking
vital
procedures
that
have
historically
varied
widely
between
medical
providers,
especially
non-emergency
surgeries.
We
support
expanding
on
the
benefits
of
Maine’s
Right-To-Shop
law
because
it
has
helped
to
prevent
surprisingly
high
medical
bills
for
patients
who
did
not
know
the
costs
of
a
procedure
before
agreeing
to
it.
By
bringing
more
consumers
and
insurers
into
the
Right-To-Shop
fold,
the
law
can
aid
individuals
in
their
search
for
quality
care
at
the
most
affordable
price
possible.
This
bill
is
right
to
eliminate
the
law’s
repeal
date.
More
transparency
leads
to
more
comprehensive
consumer
information,
and
greater
satisfaction
among
patients.
Not
to
mention
that
Right-to-Shop-style
incentives
for
consumers
have
saved
hospitals,
self-insured
small
businesses,
and
patients
from
unnecessarily
high
costs
in
Maine,
New
Hampshire,
and
other
states
which
recently
enacted
their
own
programs.

Please
deem
LD
1085
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
build
on
the
success
of
Maine’s
Right-To-Shop
law
and
ensure
the
greatest
amount
of
patient
knowledge
possible
in
regards
to
their
health
care
decisions.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
