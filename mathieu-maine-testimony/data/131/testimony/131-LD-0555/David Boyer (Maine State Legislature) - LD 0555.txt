Testimony of Representative David Boyer 
Presenting L.D. 555, An Act to Increase the Number of Mature Plants Allowed for the 
Home Cultivation of Cannabis 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and distinguished members of the Veterans and Legal 
Affairs Committee, I am asking for your support of L.D. 555, An Act to Increase the Number of 
Mature Plants Allowed for the Home Cultivation of Cannabis. 
The citizen’s initiative to tax and regulate cannabis like alcohol was passed by Maine voters in 
2016. The initiative allowed for the home cultivation of cannabis by adults 21 years of age and 
older. As passed by voters, the initiative allowed speciﬁcally for six mature plants per adult. 
The Maine Legislature established a Joint Select Committee on Marijuana Legalization 
Implementation. This committee made substantive changes to the initiative, reducing the number 
of mature plants an adult can grow and stripping social clubs from law. In my humble opinion, 
this was a slap in the face of Maine voters. 
Over the last six years, Mainers have been allowed to cultivate cannabis for personal use. \7Vhile 
there may be some neighborly squabbles from time to time, the sky certainly hasn’t fallen like 
opponents predicted. 
We are simply asking the Legislature to uphold the will of Maine voters. 
There are practical reasons to restore the plant cotuit as well. Growing cannabis outdoors in 
Maine isn’t the easiest and with only three plants there isn’t much room left for error. The plants 
are vulnerable to frost, Wind, insects, and animals. 
By only allowing just three plants, Mainers will be encouraged to grow massive plants. Indeed, 
some plants can grow up to 20 ft tall. While other strains grow short and wide. Large plants can 
restrict airﬂow and create an environment susceptible to mold.

In keeping with the theme of the 2016 campaign, Americans are allowed to brew 200 gallons of 
beer per household. This equates to 2,133 l2oZ servings of beer or roughly three bottles of beera 
day, per person. 
But cannabis isn’t alcohol. Cannabis is safer than alcohol. For many Mainers it is a medicine and 
whether they are a patient or not, they use it as a such. We have a right to medicine and a Right 
to Food. Home cultivation allows for Mainers to know exactly how their cannabis is grown and 
provides a more affordable alternative to retail stores. 
I appreciate the committee ’s consideration of L.D. 555 and would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have.
