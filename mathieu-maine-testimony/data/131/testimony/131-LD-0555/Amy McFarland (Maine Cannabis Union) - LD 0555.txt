Good Afternoon, 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Amy McFarland, I am the President of the Maine Cannabis Union. We stand next to 
the Lobstermen ’s Union, and are afﬁliated with District 4. (The lntemational Association of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.) 
In addition to this, I am a patient and a cannabis fanner. 
Today I am testifying in support of LD# 555. 
Even though this bill does not affect our industry, we at the Maine Cannabis Union are still 
Mainers. We agree with increasing the plant count for home cultivation from 3 ﬂowering plants, 
to 6 ﬂowering plants. 
Thank you for your time, 
Amy McFarland 
President, Maine Cannabis Union
