I oppose any and all legislation which increases the number of marijuana plants an 
individual or business may possess within the state of Maine. I oppose any and all 
legislation which increases access to marijuana within the state of Maine.
Marijuana “is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, alongside heroin, LSD, 
and ecstasy. The US Drug Enforcement Agency defines Schedule 1 controlled 
substances as those that the DEA believes to have no currently accepted medical use 
and a high potential for abuse.”
It is still illegal at the federal level.
