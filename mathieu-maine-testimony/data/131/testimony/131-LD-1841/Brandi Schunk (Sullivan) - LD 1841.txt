Please oppose or amend LD 1841.
I am a homeschooling mother of two in Hancock County. Our family has lived in 
Maine and has been homeschooling since 2015. I am writing today to urge you to 
please help ensure that ANY EDUCATION FUNDING INITIATIVES 
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE HOMESCHOOLERS. Homeschooling does not need to
be expensive, and can, indeed, be practically free. Using citizen tax dollars for 
homeschooling is not only unnecessary, but also could result in the loss of 
homeschool freedom and a monopoly in the education marketplace.
As a volunteer and staff member of Homeschoolers of Maine, I have produced several
videos, print materials, and social media posts educating people on the dangers of 
"school choice" funding.
I would be happy to share resources with you for more background and information if
you are interested.
Thank you for your attention and for standing up for freedom.
Sincerely,
Brandi
