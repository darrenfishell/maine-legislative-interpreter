LD 1841
An Act to Create the Empowerment Scholarship Account Program
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield, and I ask you to oppose LD 1841. 
It is not the job of government to pay for the education of children.  This makes more families and 
students reliant on the government for educational subsidies and makes them accountable to the state 
for their educational expenditures.
We don't need more dependency.  We need more freedom.  Let's not create more slaves of the state.  
Rather, let's work to get government out of education so that families can keep their hard-earned money
and better afford to pay for their own children's education expenses.
So I ask you to oppose LD 1841.  Thank you for your time.
