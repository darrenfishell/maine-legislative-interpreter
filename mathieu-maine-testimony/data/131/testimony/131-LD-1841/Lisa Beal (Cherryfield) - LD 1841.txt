Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs:  
I am Lisa E. Beal of Cherryfield, Maine, and I am writing to testify AGAINST the passage of LD 1741,
1798, 1838, 1841, and 1860.
In my eldest daughter's testimony, she mentioned the desire that other Mainers would join her in 
saying, "Thank you, but no, state funding of homeschooling [or private schooling] would just not be 
best for our families."  I am here to stand with her and say the same.  We have the God-given 
responsibility and privilege of raising our own children.  He will provide for the work He has called us 
to do.  We do not need the state government to seize by taxation that which we have earned so to 
redistribute it to others, nor do we need to forge further the chains of our own slavery by receiving from
the hand of the state that which is not the state's to give. 
I also stand with my second-eldest, who submitted individually written testimonies for all five bills, 
when she says,  "This is dangerous territory.  It puts our hard-earned freedoms [to homeschool] at 
stake, and it's just not worth it.  With government money comes government oversight, and we must 
refute it and refuse that at every turn if we would retain the liberties we now enjoy."  Hear, hear!
To other homeschoolers who may be reading this, I would say:
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,
And be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.
Galatians 5:1
Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.  Please vote "Ought not to pass" on LD 1741,
1798, 1838, 1841, and 1860.
