Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1801:
“"Resolve,
to
Increase
Transparency
and
Evaluate
Emergency
Response
Through
a
COVID-19
Review
Commission”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1801.
Public
health
policy,
like
scientific
understanding,
can
shift
significantly
over
time.
When
legislative
power
is
ceded
to
the
executive
branch
in
an
emergency,
especially
under
an
extended
state
of
emergency,
officials
should
be
held
to
the
highest
standard
of
accountability.
Despite
the
warnings
from
many
public
health
officials
and
experts
pre-2020
of
confronting
a
respiratory
virus
outbreak
with
mass
lockdowns
and
mandates,
1
our
policymakers
betrayed
the
public
trust
and
pursued
these
medieval
tactics
anyway.
We
are
merely
beginning
to
account
for
the
staggering
loss
of
life
and
increase
in
morbidity
and
mortality
over
that
time,
especially
for
younger
populations
who
faced
very
low
health
risk
from
COVID-19,
over
2020
and
2021.
2
Mortality
from
drug-related
causes
for
Mainers
aged
25-49
jumped
significantly
in
2020.
3
There
is
little
doubt
that
the
hammer-and-nail
approach
taken
by
Gov.
Mills
that
year
played
a
role
in
inflaming
an
opioid
addiction
crisis
which
had
already
begun
to
spiral
out
of
control.

This
is
precisely
why
we
need
the
COVID-19
Review
Commission
that
LD
1801
proposes,
to
fully
account
for
the
decisions
which
took
place
among
the
Governor
Mills
and
her
secret
group
of
confidants
and
administration
staff,
and
rarely
with
legislators,
during
the
15-month
long
state
of
emergency
declared
to
respond
to
the
pandemic.

Unfortunately,
even
with
the
mountain
of
evidence
available
showing
their
failures,
neither
Governor
Mills
or
any
member
of
her
administration
has
admitted
that
wielding
lockdown-inspired
policies
in
Maine
was
a
grave
mistake.
On
balance,
they
brought
more
harm
than
good
to
public
health,
social
cohesion,
and
trust
in
government.
From
low
workforce
participation
4
,
to
lagging
business
confidence,
5
to
the
condition
of
youth,
whether
it
be
worsening
mental
health
or
lost
educational
progress,
6
Mainers
need
answers
to
why
their
government
pursued
the
policies
it
did.
Were
they
merely
following
the
orders
of
higher-ups
in
Washington
D.C.,
or
were
they
crafting
policy
based
on
a
comprehensive
cost-benefit
analysis,
taking
into
account
the
many
parts
of
daily
life
Mainers
rely
on
to
maintain
health
and
happiness?
Was
there
an
interest
in
reviewing
the
efficacy
of
particular
mitigation
policies
over
time,
or
did
the
administration
simply
buy
into
the
ethos
of
censorship
and
propaganda
that
consumed
the
federal
government
public
health
apparatus?
7
Please
deem
LD
1801
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
begin
the
formal
process
of
understanding
what
occurred
behind
closed
doors
during
the
15-month-long
state
of
emergency.
Mainers
deserve
full
knowledge
and
transparency.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
