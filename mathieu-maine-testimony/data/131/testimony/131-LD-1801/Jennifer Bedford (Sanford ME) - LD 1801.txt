LD 1801
Senator Baldacci and Representative Michele Meyer and Members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee, 
I write to you today and ask that you please deem LD 1801 Ought To Pass and begin 
the formal process of understanding what occurred behind closed doors during the 
15-month-long state of emergency. Mainers deserve full knowledge and transparency.
