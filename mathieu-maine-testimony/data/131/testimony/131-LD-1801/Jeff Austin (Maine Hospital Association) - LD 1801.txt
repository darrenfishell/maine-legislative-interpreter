 
  
TESTIMONY OF THE MAINE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION 
 
In Support Of 
 
LD 1801 - Resolve, to Increase Transparency and Evaluate Emergency Response  
Through a COVID-19 Review Commission 
 
May 8, 2023 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name is Jeffrey Austin and I am here on behalf of the Maine Hospital Association.   
I am offering this testimony in support for LD 1801. 
MHA represents Maine’s 36 private acute care, psychiatric hospital and rehabilitation hospitals. 
Obviously, no one believes all of the steps taken in response to COVID by the different agencies 
and actors was perfect. 
However, the more difficult question is whether we can agree on reasonable steps to improve our 
decisionmaking in the future. 
While we don’t know if such agreement is possible, we do believe it is worth trying. 
In addition, there were things that went remarkably well and we also want those efforts to be 
highlighted so that they are again utilized in the future. 
Maine Hospitals are ready and willing to participate in a review of Maine’s response to the COVID 
epidemic so that we might be even better prepared to respond to the next public health emergency. 
Thank you.
