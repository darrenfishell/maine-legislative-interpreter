LD 1327 — An Act to Limit the Requirements Regarding Leadership Political Action 
Committees and to Promote Clean Election Transparency 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
April 12, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the committee -1 am Martha Currier, 
the Assistant Director of the Maine Ethics Commission. The Commission is neither for nor 
against LD 1327, and We wish to provide information to assist your consideration of this 
legislation. 
LD 1327 proposes legislators who Want a PAC that only promotes policy related matters be 
excluded from forming a leadership PAC. A “leadership PAC” is deﬁned in statute to be directly 
or indirectly established or controlled by a current member of the Legislature. 21-A M.R.S.§ 
1052 (4-C). This deﬁnition means that the PAC is identiﬁed as having members of the 
Legislature in these roles on their registration fonn with the Commission. PL 2021, Chapter 74 
that took effect in January limits a leadership PAC from accepting donations from business 
entities and any other contributions are limited to $475 per year, Whereas PACs deemed as 
traditional do not have contribution limits. We currently have 12 leadership PACs — one 
identiﬁes as issue orientated and the remainder support candidates. 
LD 1327 also proposes Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) candidates collect the occupation and 
employer information for any person making a $5 qualifying contribution (QC). QCs are 
collected by MCEA candidates from voters in their district to obtain public funding for their 
campaigns. These candidates are already required to provide the name, date, and address on their 
QC forms submitted to our ofﬁce. The proposal is in the same vein of reporting as traditionally 
ﬁnanced candidates, PACs, and party committees that must obtain and report occupation and 
employer infonnation for individual donations of $50 or more. 21-A M.R.S. § 1016 3(B). 
Finally, as currently written the occupation and employer information would be conﬁdential 
under 21-A M.R.S. § 1125 3(1). 
Thank you for your time, I would be glad to answer any questions.
