Dear Committee Members:
It is common sense that able-bodied adults should be WORKING and not collecting 
WELFARE.  Maine has a problem with employment, the employer has more jobs 
than employees.  No one should be on welfare if they are able to work.  That's 
common sense,
I ask the you vote OUGHT to PASS, Thank you
