Honorable Senator BaldaccI and RepresentatIve Meyer and the members of the Health and Human 
ServIces CommIttee- 
My name Is Rev ChrIstIne Dyke, I am the Lead MInIster at FIrst ParIsh Church UCC In Gorham I am 
also a board member of Greater Portland FamIly PromIse 
Th|s summer FIrst ParIsh Church w|ll be convertIng a floor of our buIldIng Into housIng for asylum 
seekIng famIlIes through the Long-Term SolutIons Grant provlded for by the Leglslature FamIlIes w|ll 
use General Ass|stance to pay for the|r food and a portIon of the|r rent 
FamIly PromIse helps famIlIes to apply for and access publIc beneﬁts programs, housIng and food 
resources and they know the General Ass|stance program InsIde and out 
I am here today to testIfy In support LD I426, An Act to Secure HousIng for the Most Vulnerable 
MaIne ResIdents by Amendlng the Laws GovernIng MunIcIpal General Ass|stance, LD I664 An Act to 
Increase ReImbursement Under the General Ass|stance Program, and LD I675 An Act to Amend the 
Laws Governlng the General Ass|stance Program RegardIng ElIgIbIlIty, HousIng Ass|stance and State 
Re|mbursement and to EstabIIsh a WorkIng Group I am In support of these three bIIIs because they 
help to Increase access to General Ass|stance and help to sImplIfy the program 
We want bolster and strengthen new arrIvaIs, not Increase the|r stress and anxIety puttlng them and 
the|r famIIIes at a dIsadvantage 
People are better able to fully partIcIpate In the|r communItIes and thrIve when they have adequate 
shelter, nutrItIon, and health care General Ass|stance Invests In people and the|r wellbemg as they 
work towards fInancIal securIty General Ass|stance Is one of the many supports that helps MaIners to 
achIeve sustaInable Independence 
I am In favor of the proposed Improvements to the General Ass|stance program The General 
Ass|stance reImbursement rates are currently too low and don’t match the rental rates throughout the 
state Many landlords don’t accept GA vouchers because the reImbursement rate IS not hIgh enough 
The maxImum level of asslstance should be the same amount as a sectIon 8 voucher so that we level 
the playIng ﬁeld and gIve more famIIIes access to the housIng that they deserve. 
WhIIe FIrst ParIsh w|ll be requestIng a rent far below sectIon 8 vouchers, our goal wIth the program IS 
to be an InterIm place of housIng untII an apartment can be secured 
AddItIonal|y, every town In MaIne should be reImbursed 90% of the money they spend for GA 
Many munIcIpalItIes IImIt the amount of General Ass|stance funds that they grant because they aren't 
reImbursed enough from the state As a fIrst-tIme homeowner In Gorham I understand that an 
IndIvIdual town or cIty cannot bear the costs on the|r own, but together as a state we can

support those municipalities that have the needed resources for asylum seeking families given 
their statutory restrictions on earning income through employment Those resources include 
public transportation and English Language Learner classes in the schools I am proud to say that 
Gorham has both resources I am also in favor of families only needing to reapply or recertify for 
General Assistance every 6-I2 months to streamline and simply the process Then they can focus 
on completing their asylum applications 
Finally, I am in favor of requiring that municipalities complete a training on the requirements of the 
General Assistance program to support a more uniform and equal program implementation 
I am here to testify against LD I82, LD 268, and LD 454, these three bills impose harmful 
restrictions on the General Assistance program such as residency requirements, time limits and 
other restrictions that prevent people from having access to housing and food 
All Mainers want and need to be able to put a roof over our heads, food on our tables, and pay 
for other essenuals like medication and diapers 
I have run quite a few food panties in my career, and am astounded by the amount of time, 
energy, and resources, such as gas money, we require of people living in poverty, ]USt to provide 
themselves and their family with adequate nutrition Providing nutritional support through GA 
allows families to access food when they need it, rather than when it is convenient for food 
pantries and their volunteers to supply it 
When people have stable housing, adequate nutrition, and good health, they are better able to 
consistently participate in work Access to housing and food enhances the wellbeing of Mainers 
and reduces social service costs by providing targeted health and social services and helps end the 
cycle of poverty for families While families wait to receive their work authorization, they are 
working on furthering their education and increasing their skills, attending school, completing 
certificate and higher education degree programs 
I support the biills that simplifies and increase access to General Assistance I do not support 
restrictions and timelines that make it harder for people to access GA and further impact the 
homelessness crises that we are facing here in the State of Maine 
People need access to housing, food and other basic needs to be able to provide for themselves 
and their families The goal is to increase access to GA and simplify the program and not add 
further constraints and restrictions Any additional rules, penalties, residency requirements and 
time limits ]USt make it harder for families to access this essential program that supports families 
on the road to self-sufficiency 
I urge you to vote in support of the three separate bills (LD I426, LD I664, LD I675) that 
increase access to General Assistance or to vote in support of one combined bill that 
incorporates positive changes and improvements to this essential program 
Thank you
