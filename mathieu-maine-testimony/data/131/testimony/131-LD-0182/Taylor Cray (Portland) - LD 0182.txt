 Hello Chair Baldacci, Chair Meyer, and honorable members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Services,
My name is Taylor Cray, and I am the Outreach Team Leader with Preble Street’s 
Advocacy Team. I am here today to ask that you vote in opposition to the following bills:
- LD 182: An Act to Create a 9-month Time Limit on General Assistance Benefits for 
Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents
- LD 183: An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Program into Municipal General Assistance Programs
- LD 268: An Act to Establish a 45-day Municipal Residency Requirement for 
General Assistance Programs
- LD 364: An Act to Prohibit the Use of General Assistance as a Replacement for 
Available Resources
- LD 454: An Act to Establish a 180-day State Residency Requirement for Municipal 
General Assistance
This slate of bills, while attempting to address a shortage of resources in the State of 
Maine, approaches this issue in a way that will ultimately lead to increased suffering, 
instability, and fear among Maine people. The approach taken to address this issue needs 
to be one of compassion, one that considers the multifaceted challenges of poverty and 
seeks not to punish the poor by limiting their access to resources but instead to 
supplement existing resources and ensure that no Mainer goes without food, housing, 
healthcare, or access to other vital resources. 
Each of these bills proposes changes to General Assistance that would decrease access to 
what is often a life-saving resource. LD 182, which proposes time limits to GA access for 
able-bodied adults without dependents, puts an anxiety-inducing time limit on access to 
food and shelter. The struggles that Maine and the nation face with workforce 
participation will not be solved by limiting the population’s access to the essential 
resources necessary for survival. It is incredibly difficult to maintain stable employment 
when you are concerned about where your next meal is coming from or where you may 
spend the night. Similarly, limiting access to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF), as I suggested in LD 183, only ensures that parents and children live in constant 
fear of losing access to food. This does not improve the ability of parents to work, nor 
does it improve the ability of children to attend school. Limiting access to TANF nearly 
ensures that families in need will suffer unnecessary consequences through no fault of 
their own.

 LD 286 and LD 454 ask that those seeking General Assistance provide proof of residency 
for municipalities and the state, respectively, to receive assistance. Proof of residency is 
an incredibly limiting factor for folks who are unhoused, New Mainers, or otherwise 
unable to access a consistent mailing address. Particularly for unhoused folks, the inability 
to use a post office box as proof of residency presents a barrier that may be 
unsurpassable. Many folks living outside without access to a permanent address 
frequently use a post office box to ensure that they do not miss important mail even 
though they are frequently moving around. By implementing proof of residency 
requirements, we essentially deem folks unworthy of assistance if they are unlucky 
enough to be experiencing any difficulty that renders them unable to meet these criteria. 
The final bill in this collection, LD 364, would limit folks from accessing General Assistance 
if they have not already accessed all other available resources. This bill would penalize 
individuals and families for lack of knowledge about other available resources. For those 
attempting to navigate the complicated system of General Assistance on their own, this 
may be the only resource they are aware of. They look to General Assistance as a well-
known resource in their need for assistance. As with the other four of these bills, this 
legislation would only increase barriers to the help that folks are so desperate. With these 
barriers in mind, I ask you to vote against each of these bills for the sake of Mainers and 
the health and well-being of our state. 
Thank you for your time and consideration today. 
Sincerely, 
Taylor Cray
