.. Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 809, An Act to Allow Regional School Units with School Choice to Opt 
Out of School Choice 
Before the Education and Cultural Ajfairs Committee 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 and the 
communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island. I am here before you today to 
present LD 809, An Act to Allow Regional School Units with School Choice to Opt Out of 
School Choice. 
The bill before you today comes by request from a local town manager in my district. They 
shared with me that the cost of school choice has increased almost tenfold in the last ﬁve years, 
and you can imagine the strain this puts on our school budgets. 
This bill would allow a regional school unit whose reorganization plan includes school choice for 
the grade levels that had school choice in the prior school administrative units to holda 
referendum to amend the reorganization plan in order to opt out of the school choice provisions. 
Recognizing that this could disrupt the school year for students who are utilizing school choice at 
the time of the referendum, the bill requires that any amended school reorganization plan must 
include a transition period so that students are not adversely impacted. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I am happy to answer any questions you have of me. 
District 26: Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island
