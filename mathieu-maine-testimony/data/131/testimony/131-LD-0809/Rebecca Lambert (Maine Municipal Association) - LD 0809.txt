In Opposition to  
 
LD 809 - An Act to Allow Regional School Units with School Choice to Opt Out of School Choice  
 
March 30, 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs 
Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony in opposition to  
LD 809  on behalf of Maine Municipal  Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Currently, regional school units with a reorgan ization plan have the ability to amend their plans to exclude 
school choice if they wish, subject to approval by the Commissioner of Education and ratification by a majority of voters at a referendum. The impacts of school choice vary widely for different school districts across Maine, yet local officials agree that the opportunity for choice should remain a matter of local decision -making.  
 Considering the ability to amend a reorganization plan currently exists and that local leaders strongly support the n otion of local control , the LPC feels that any decision regarding school choice  should be left 
to local  decision -making authorities  to determine  if that is something they would like to bring forward to 
their voters.  
 
Thank you for your time and for conside ring the municipal perspective on this issue.
