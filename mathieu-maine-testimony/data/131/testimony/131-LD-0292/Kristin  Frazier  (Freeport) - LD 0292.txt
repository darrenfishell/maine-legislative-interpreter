We are writing in support of LD 292 An Act to Establish Maine Needham Day. Sorry we 
couldn't join you - we are busy selling heart-shaped chocolate boxes (and Needhams) and 
dipping strawberries in chocolate! Chocolatiers across Maine know that Needhams are on a 
short list of confections that must be made with the highest quality to consider yourself a 
"Maine Chocolatier." It is not enough to have a delicious coconut cream, it must contain 
Maine mashed potatoes to be considered a true Maine Needham. Maine chocolatiers take 
pride in representing the agricultural bounty of Maine in this delectable treat. We enjoy 
introducing "people from away" to the Maine Needham- it always brings a smile to peoples' 
faces to hear that potatoes are a main ingredient! But the magic is when they taste it and 
appreciate the subtle talents of potato as a moistening and binding agent that lets the soft 
coconut shine through. Our regular customers know and request this piece so much, enough 
that it is included in nearly all of our assortments. We think that this special day would be 
effective in highlighting the collective strengths of both Maine chocolatiers and the Maine 
potato industry. Thank you for your time and appreciation of the talents of your local Maine 
chocolatiers.
