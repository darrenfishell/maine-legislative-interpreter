Dear Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and Members of the Committee:
I am writing in support of LD292 ‘An Act to Establish Maine Needham Day’.  My 
wife and I own Old Port Candy Co, and Old Port Card Works.  Our stores sell and 
promote local companies that produce one of Maine’s best treats- Needham’s.  Most 
people from away want to take home something unique from Maine.  Needhams are 
the perfect gift to bring home.  They are made here in Maine with local products 
including Maine potatoes.  It’s a great way to promote Maine products, Maine farms, 
and Maine small businesses. I urge you to please support a Maine Needham Day.
Thank you!
Tom Largay
