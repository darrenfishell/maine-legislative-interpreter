Dear Senator Tim Nangle, Representative Holly Stover, and members of the Joint Committee on State 
and Locai Government, 
I am writing to you in support the Act to Establish Maine Needham Day as outlined in Legisiative 
Document No. 292 and initiated by Representative Maggie O'Neil. 
My husband, Gerard, and l are the owners of the Maine Needham Company, a Saco based business. We 
ﬁrst reached out to Rep. O'Neil, as our local Representative, last year with the idea to establish a Maine 
Needham Day in honor of the 150*‘ anniversary of the Needham, historically understood to be first 
created by Seavey's Confections in the early 1870's. While we were unsuccessful in our petition to the 
Governor at that time, Rep. O'Neil was inspired by the grand historical value of the tradition of the 
Maine Needham and continues to pursue a day of recognition for this uniquely Maine treat. 
Our purpose for supporting this initiative is solely historical. While we do make our living on the 
production of Needhams, we also highly value the tradition and history itself, as evidenced by our 
mission statement, “to presen/e, revitalize, and expand the tradition of the Maine Needham. ” We are 
proud of the heritage and Maine-centric identity of the Needham and feel it is important to honor and 
celebrate this sweet piece of our state history. Your approval of this act would go a long way toward 
"preserving and revitalizing ” the tradition of the Maine Needham for generations to come. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Kind regards,
'
