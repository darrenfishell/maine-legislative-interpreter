Testimony in Support of LD 1650, An Act to Create a Tiered Senior Resident Homestead Exemption  
April 25 , 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative  Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is Maura 
Pillsbury and I am an analyst at  the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am submitting this  testi mony  in 
support of LD 1650.  
 
LD 1650 would repeal the property tax stabilization program  for the  2024  tax year , and in its place enact  
a tiered homestead exemption for Mainers 65 and older.  The new tiered homestead  exemption  for 
older Mainers  would be $25,000  for those with 80  percent  or less of the regional median  family  income, 
and $15,000 for those with 80 -100 percent of regional medi an family income.   
 
The existing homestead exemption program allows for a property tax exemption  of up to  $25,000 of 
property value for  permanent Maine residents on their primary residence.  LD 1650  would allow 
participants to stack the  benefits on top of e ach other , allowing older Mainers with the greatest need to 
receive a property tax exemption for up to $50,000 of their property value , essentially doubling their 
existing homestead exemption.  
 
MECEP supports this bill because it is a more targeted benefit for  older Mainers who need it most , as 
opposed to the  property tax stabilization program, which provides a benefit  to even the wealthiest 
Mainers . As we testified previously, the property tax stabilization program  provides  disproportionately 
greate r benefits to Mainers with wealth because they have higher property values . 
 
A tiered homestead exemption  will reduce property taxes for older Mainers struggling the most to 
afford housing and other necessities.  The homestead exemption is an important prog ram for reducing 
property tax  liability , especially for homeowners who live in areas with low property values but high mil 
rates.  According to Maine Revenue Services, the average statewide mil rate for 2021 is 12.66 milsi 
($12.66 per $1,000 of property va lue), which would value the average full homestead exemption at 
$316.50 (12.66 x 25) . Adding a property tax exemption for an additional  $15,000  or $25,000  of 
property value  would provide an additional property tax reduction  of approximately $189.90 or 
$316.50  for older Mainers in need  (depending on their mil rate) .  
 
The bill tasks the State Tax Assessor with determining eligibility  annually and providing a list of eligible 
residents and their exemption levels to municipalities , which we believe is preferable to avoid 
administrative complexity and burden  on municipalities.  Because this program would be administered 
similar to the existing h omestead exemption, it would also eliminate the necessity for  an annual 
application.

i Equalized average state mil rate for 2021. There is wide variation among average mil rates , from 9.21 in Lincoln  
County  to 18.18 in Aroostook  County . Property taxes are calculated using local mil rates, therefore this is an 
approximation.  See Maine Revenue  Services website on full value tax rates.
