LD 1650
Listening to the testimony on Tuesday, 4/25/23, with respect to LD1650, I feel that 
some of the testifiers are missing the point.  The income eligibility issue shouldn't be 
just the income level relative to median income levels.  The test should be income 
level relative to the level of property taxes.  Someone who has income of $80,000, but
property taxes of only $1,000, might be fine and not need much, if any, help.  
Conversely, someone who has income of $110,000, but property taxes of $20,000 
might need some help.  It is not hard to visualize someone who bought their house on 
the water 30-40 years ago when the property taxes on the house were $1,000, but now
owes $20,000 due to appreciation and higher tax levels.  I think a fairer test would be 
looking at what percent of the individual's or couple's income has to go to paying 
property taxes.  This became even more important when the deduction for State and 
Local Taxes (SALT) were limited to $10k.
