Dear Senator Curry , Representative Roberts , and members of the Committee o n Innovation, 
Development, Economic Advancement and Business,  
 
As Director of the Office of Outdoor Recreation, I  am writing to share this letter in opposition to 
LD 281, An Act to Require Ski Area Safety Plans and Reporting.  
 
Outdoor recreation makes up 3.6% of Maine’s economy, $2.8 billion in value -added to GDP, 
making Maine one of the top five states in the country in the value outdoor recreation adds to 
statewide GDP.  Outdoor recreation supports more than 30,000  jobs in Maine, providing more than 
$1.2 billion in compensation. Snow sports contribute $51 million to those statewide numbers and 
have considerable positive impact particularly on rural local and regional economies. Ski areas are 
a critical part of the e conomy for many rural communities.  
 
The Office of Outdoor Recreation is opposed to this bill for several reasons. The provisions of this 
bill would establish an excessive  level of  documentation and monitoring. This has the potential to 
set precedent across  the US for ski areas. Sections of the proposed legislation may also violate 
patient privacy laws  under HIPPA .  
 
Safety is important to every ski operator across the Maine, and the entire United States. Ski areas 
have a long list of active safety measures they follow every day , constantly monitoring weather 
and mountain conditions and modifying operations when appropriate. Ski areas staff a trained ski 
patrol to provide first aid , assess mountain safety, post warnings and close trails when necessary.  
 
Maine, and most ski states, have an inherent risk statute that clearly outlines the personal 
responsibilities of th ose who participate in skiing and snowboarding . This statute is po sted at every 
single lift  and ticket office and is printed on every lift ticket. Skiers and snowboarders must follow 
the National Skier Responsibility Code which clearly outlines that participants must be in control.   
 
If enacted, this legislation would have a detrimental effect on Maine’s rural economy as this level 
of safety reporting could restrict operations to the extent that  skiers turn to our competitors in New 
Hampshire and Vermont.
