Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary 
My name IS Danae Kershner I am a board -certified family medicine physician, practicing in 
Maine and I represent the American Academy of Medical Ethics lam testifying in OppOSl’L‘lOf1 to 
LD 1735 ”An Act to Safeguard Gender Affirming Healthcare ” 
As physicians, we know that braih development is an ongoing process through adolescence, 
especially that of the frontal lobe which is where executive funchon occurs Executwe function 
is that part of the mind that is able to plan ahead, have emotional control, perceive cause and 
effect, and design and pursue goals That part of the brain IS not fully developed until 
adulthood Gender reassignment IS a mammoth decision for anyone, and should not even be 
considered outside the context of extensive counseling, and clear informed consent regarding 
the medical and surgical risks involved in both chemical and surgical gender transiuon Children 
do not have the frontal lobe development to fully understand the risks of making a gender 
transition, and can be easily inﬂuenced to make life altering, irreversible decisions which a\ re 
regretted later in life How can they understand that by making this change they are subjecting 
themselves to signiﬁcantly increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, and 
thrombot embolism as adults, and that mortality IS increased up to 50% over the general 
population? 1,2 Research tells us that 85% of children who report gender dysphoria are content 
in their assigned biologic gender when they become adults 3,4,5,6,7, An ever growing body of 
scientific research points to watchful waiting as the best practice during childhood and 
adolescence 
LD1735 not only promotes inappropriate medical treatment for this vulnerable population but 
categorizes parents who want to protect their children from making these decisions in 
childhood as child abusers It would allow the State to remove children from their protective 
homes and families In addition, it would provide sanctuary for physicians who have violated 
laws in other states regarding gender transition to minors It would inhibit cooperation with 
investigation or extradition of these medical violators, and handcuff the courts from intervening 
in child abduction for the purposes of gender reassignment In a world where human trafficking 
is of astronomical proportions, LD 1735 would prove to be an open door to people who want to 
manipulate our children for their own profit LD 1735 will violate the primary tenant of 
medicine by harming our children and l strongly urge you to vote, "Ought not to pass”
