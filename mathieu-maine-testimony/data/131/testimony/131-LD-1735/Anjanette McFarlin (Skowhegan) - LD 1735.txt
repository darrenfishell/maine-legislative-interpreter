LD 1735
LD 1735 is not a wise bill. Children are not mature enough to make irreversible life 
changing decisions. We as adults need to guide them and support them until they are 
old enough to fully understand their choices. We do not allow them to get tattoos or 
certain cosmetic procedures. It should be the same for "gender affirming health care."
Children will experiment, some more than others, and will shift through different 
gender roles. By the time they are old enough to drink, they will know with some 
certainty what they identify as and then we should offer support.
We as responsible adults need to protect our children from decisions which may turn 
out to be disastrous for them. We need to nurture them into adulthood where only 
then can they make informed decisions for themselves.
Thank you.
