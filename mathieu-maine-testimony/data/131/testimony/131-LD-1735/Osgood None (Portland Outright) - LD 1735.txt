Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and dlstmgurshed members of the Jomt 
Standmg Comnuttee on Jud1c1ary My name 1s Osgood, I use they/them pronotms, and I am the Executlve 
Dlrector of Portland Outnght, whlch has been representlng and advocatmg for Mame’s LGBTQF youth 
smce 1988 On behalf of our members and constltuents, LGBTQ+ young leaders and then commmntles, I 
urge you to support LD 1735 
Tlns afternoon, you w1ll have the opportumty to hear from my colleagues on the legal, medrcal, and 
natlonal context of thls b1ll I Wlll be usmg my trme to share the nnpacts of th1s leglslatlon on transgender 
sunnval, JOY, and futures 
I began my work wlth Portland Outrlght ten years ago, 1n my early 20’s Durtng these years I have had the 
chance to speak on many brlls, bmld strong pohcres, and orgamze dally wlthm Mame ’s LGBTQ+ 
commumty I have worked shoulder-to-shoulder w1th transgender youth and adults whose contr1but1ons to 
thls work have saved and enr1ched the llves of many I have been transfonned UI116 and tlme agam by the 
leadershlp of everyday people and the people m ﬂns chamber today As a young, publlcly queer and trans 
person I have expenenced a level of safety, acceptance, and support to llve and to advance a career 1n my 
state that my peers across the country often do not I have had the oppoltunlty to not only survlve, but to 
ﬂounsh, as a result of steady access to gender-a ﬁhmmg care and a commrtment from the state of Mame 
to protect, aﬂirm, and 1nvest1n trans commtuuttes I am a Joyful, thnvmg adult and commumty member 
as a result
LD1735 1s an opportumty for Mame to once agam comnnt to trans commumtles by actmg as a shleld to 
ﬂrose seekmg evldence-based health care m our state In th1s pohtrcal moment 1t 1s v1tal that we takea 
ﬁrm stand agalnst the crunlnalrzatron of transgender people and then loved ones 
We know that access to gender afﬁrmmg medrcal care and supportlve commumtles are THE 11fel1ne for 
LGBTQ+ young people Havmg Ma1ne _]011'1 a growmg number of states takrng a proactrve stance on 
transgender nghts sends a clear message to youth and famlhes, mcludmg your nelghbors and constrtuents, 
that they matter p 
When we talk of trans Joy, we mean the cntrcal need to celebrate and love each other ﬁercely 1n sp1te ofa 
world that was not bmlt to protect us It 1s the fuel to keep ﬁghtlng, as well as our own vers10n of a shleld 
In ten years at Portland Outnght, I have had the pnvrlege to support many young people, from here and 
from away, who have found safety and care 1n Mame Today, as we welgh the questlons before us, I hope 
we choose to create a shreld b1g enough to cover them and anyone else seekmg safety and care It would 
be an honor to say I worked alongsrde you to ensure thelr futures, therr ablhty to ﬂounsh as well, are 
protected here 1n Ma1ne 
Smcerely
