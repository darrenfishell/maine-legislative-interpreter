LD 1735
Honorable members of the Judiciary committee.
My name is Bob Roemmich and am writing in OPPOSITION to LD 1735.  
If I have read the bill and it's summary correctly, this bill would do MORE harm to 
young children that are making a mistake that will affect their lives for as long as they
live and the State of Maine is not doing itself a favor in declaring, in essence, a 
sanctuary state for, not only abortions, but for trans-gender activities.  
This is not the way Maine should go.  Not only should Maine NOT go down this road,
many minor youth do not get the truth about the trans gender process. And if they are 
informed about the whole truth of the processes, I would place a bet that most of them
would change their mind regarding the process.
I believe that if someone breaks the law in a state that has laws on the books, they 
should be held accountable for their actions.  Now those efforts to come a sanctuary 
state for all the medical persons who break those laws and if Maine can assist in at 
least helping to locate the offender and send that person back to the state they broke 
the law in.
Thank you for your time
Respectfully submitted 
Bob. Roemmich
