 Re:  LD 1735: An Act to Safeguard Gender -affirming Health Care  – LETTER OF SUPPORT  
 
Dear Representative OSHER , Senator  CARNEY , and  Representatives  MILLIKEN , MOONEN, SALISBURY, 
SHEEHAN,  and WORTH of Ellsworth : 
 
The Maine Psychological Association (MePA) is a membership organization representing psychologists in Maine who work in private practice, at Maine’s colleges and universities, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting health and human welfare.  
 
MePA supports LD 1735: An Act to Safeguard Gender -affirming Health Care, in a general sense. As an 
association for psychologists, we agree with the importance of protecting gender affirming healthcare . 
The American Psychological Association ( APA ), as well as other healthcare  organizations, (e.g., American 
Counseling Association, World Professional Association for Transgender Health ) have established 
empirically supported practice guidelines that encourage clinicians to use gender -affirming  practices 
when addressing gender  identity issues (ACA, 2010; APA , 2015; Coleman et al., 2012).  
We are available to provide additional input if requested.  
Thank you.  
Sincerely,  
 
 
Jamie Pratt, PsyD  
President
