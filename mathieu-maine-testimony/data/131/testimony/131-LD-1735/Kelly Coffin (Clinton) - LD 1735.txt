Kelly Coffin
Clinton
LD 1735
Honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, My name is Kelly Coffin from 
Clinton. LD1735 is crazy. Maine shouldn't consider anything to do with changing 
bodies of minors surgically or hormonally. This is SO dangerous. I have listened to 
several detransitioners, one named Chloe Cole, who regret permanently chang-
ing their bodies. The hormone blockers will cause IRREVERSIBLE conditions. 
Gender Dysphoria is MENTAL ILLNESS.  You don't play along with a lie you use 
truth. The truth is there is no real studies here or elsewhere that prove this reduces 
suicide. I believe if a real study were done it would prove the contrary. Some 
European countries are now reversing this type of care. Research Scott Newgent to 
hear the truth about it. (He) states I will die early from this.
