I implore you to reconsider this legislation that will essentially create a sanctuary state
in Maine for children identifying as trans and their families.  While I sympathize with 
these children, I cannot see how we can encourage them to experiment with 
life-altering and irreversible pharmaceutical treatments and surgeries WITH or 
WITHOUT their parents' knowledge.  Research has shown that many of these 
children have other diagnoses that can be better resolved with counseling, not drastic 
hormone treatments that affect their health forever, or disfiguring surgeries that 
cannot be corrected.
There is no consensus on the efficacy of this type of treatment for one thing.  But just 
as important, it is not the business of the government to determine the treatment of  
these children.  Please consider that you may be succumbing to confirmation bias, and
look into the data and research that cautions against both the irreversible treatments 
and the harms that come from the state's gross intervention into private lives.  The 
road to hell is paved with good intentions.
End this travesty.
Thank you,
Janet Ham
