I read this bill over and over and thought about the perhaps unintended consequences 
of taking such action.  It would mark Maine as a sanctuary state for those individuals 
who are prohibited by law to seek affirmation in their home states.  It pits child 
against parents who oppose this method of treatment.  It pits parent against parent and
state against state.  I forsee a court system overwhelmed already, becoming even more
overwhelmed.  The cost to Maine citizens is not only an expense that we need not 
take on but at a time when we have difficulty meeting the needs of residents and 
others due to rising costs in every aspect of life.  What does this law do?  It makes it 
clear that if you just get to Maine, Maine will not recognize the fundamental rights of 
parents to engage in opposition to gender affirmation care they deem a danger to the 
wellbeing of their child. If a child is abandoned, the state acts as the parent in a child's
right to choose.   I am opposed to this bill as it usurp the basic human rights of 
parents, sets Maine as a sanctuary state and with it, the burdens of tax funded care and
litigation and sets president for further erosion of the family at it core.
