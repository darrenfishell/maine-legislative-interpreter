LD 1735
Oppose this horrible bill LD1735 that may permanently damage young children from 
my state of New Hampshire without parental permission.  Anyone who supports this 
bill does not believe in God.  
Since when is gender affirming surgery or drugs an emergency. Are these children 
going to die without this misguided treatment. Please, please use common sense and 
kill this bill.
