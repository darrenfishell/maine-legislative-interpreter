LD 1735
It is imperative that you oppose this bill! As parents and grandparents, we are 
obligated to protect the children, they are all confused about who, and what they are 
throughout the course of their childhood. There is so much thatâ€™s going on in the 
world that causes great confusion in their minds.. I beg you to not approve this; 
decisions like this need to be made when somebody is an adult and has a better 
understanding of what the long-term affects are to having surgery and hormone 
treatments. Be an adult, be a parent, be a grandparent, do the right thing and OPPOSE
this Bill LD 1735!
