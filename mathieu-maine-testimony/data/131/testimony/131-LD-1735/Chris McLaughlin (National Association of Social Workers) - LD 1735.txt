Testrmony re LD 1735 “An Act to Safeguard Gender-af ﬁnnmg Health Care” — OUGHT TO PASS 
Senator Carney, Replesentatlve Moonen, and honorable members of the Jomt Standlng Commlttee on Jud1c1ary 
Thank you for the opportunlty to provlde these comments 1n strong support of LD 1735 My name 1s Chns McLaughlm, 
and I am a hcensed clnncal soc1a1 Worker w1th over 22 years of expenence prov1dmg behav1oral health serv1ces to ch11dren 
and fam1l1es across a vanety of treatment settmgs here 1n Ma1ne For all of those years, I have worked d1rectly 1n some 
capaclty w1th trans gender and gender d1verse youth and the1r parents and fam1l1es For 2 decades, I have prov1ded tra1mng 
to schools, commumty organlzatlons, and healthcare fac1l1t1es around the un1que needs of trans- and gender dlverse chents 
I am also hmnbed to be the Executlve Dlrector of the Ma1ne Chapter of the Nat1onal Assoc1at1on of Soc1al Workers 
(NASW-ME) A large part of my _|ob at NASW-l\/[E 1s to represent the mterests of Ma1ne’s soc1al workers as they endeavor 
to meet the behavloral health needs of Mame people across all settmgs and ages from Fort Kent to York and all places 1n 
between On behalf of our over 1000 members here 1n Mame, I’m honored to share thoughts on th1s 1mpo1tant proposed 
leglslatlon 
We are ﬁrmly 1n support of LD 1735 and would 11ke to offer our smcere gratltude to Representatlve Osher for her tlreless 
work on th1s rmportant 1ssue As you mrght know, gender afﬁnmng care encompasses a range of medrcal treatments and 
procedures that enable 1nd1v1duals to ahgn the1r physlcal appearance w1ththe1r gender 1dent1ty Th1S can 1nclude honnone 
therapy, gender conﬁrmatlon surgenes, and other forms of medlcal and psychologlcal care F01 many trans gender 
1nd1v1duals, gender afﬁrm1ng care 1s essentlal to thelr mental and physlcal well-bemg and denymg them access to these 
treatments can have devastatmg consequences Early mtervent1on 1s cruclal for mental and physrcal well-be1ng, help1ng to 
reduce mental health dlspantles and 1mprove overall quahty of l1fe L1m1t1ng access to gender-af ﬁrmmg care 1s dangerous 
Research has cons1stently shown that gender-af ﬁrmmg care s1gn1ﬁcantly reduces rates of dBp1'€SS1OI1, anxlety, and su1c1dal 
1deat1on among transgender youth Lead1ng med1ca1 organ1zat1ons, such as the Amerrcan Med1calAssoc1at1on, Amencan 
Psycholog1cal Ass0c1at1on, the Nat1onalAssoc1at1on of Soclal Workers, and the World Profess1onalAssoc1at1on for 
Transgender Health, endorse gender-af ﬁnnmg care as appropnate and necessary treatment for these young 1nd1v1duals 
Unfortunately, there are st1ll many barners to accessmg gender afﬁrmmg care, mcludmg d1scr1m1nat1on from healthcare 
prov1ders, l1m1ted 1nsurance cove1 age, and legrslatlve efforts to restuct access to these tleatments We have seen these 
leglslatlve restr1ct1ons emerge across the country In fact, at the tlme I am wntmg th1s test1mony today, the ACLU has 
1dent1ﬁed 469 ant1-LGBTQ+ b1l1s that have been 1ntroduced across the country Many of these b1lls are efforts to restnct 
gender-af ﬁrmmg care to some of the most vulnerable 1nd1v1duals m our country today transgender youth At the tune of 
th1s Wr1tmg, 12 states have enacted laws restnctmg or banmng access to gender-af ﬁrmmg care for m1nors S1mply put, 
Mame 1s better than th1s Representatlve Osher’s b1ll before you today ensures that the ent1re country also knows that 
Mame IS better than th1s 
To ensure equal access to treatment for all transgender youth, we must el1m1nate those barners to gender-af ﬁnmng care, 
such as ﬁI13.1Z1C1&l burdens, 1nsm'ance coverage, and geograph1call1m1tat1ons These barners not only hann 1nd1v1duals 
seekmg care, but also perpetuate hannful stereotypes and d1scr1m1nat1on agamst the transgender commumty as a whole 
Gender-af ﬁmnng care 1s not a one-s1ze- ﬁts-all approach, 1t 1s lmplemented through a tarlored treatment plan crafted 
between healthcare experts and then pat1ents and guard1ans that takes mto account each 1nd1v1dual's umque needs, goals, 
and cncumstances NASW ME beheves that 1t 1s essent1al whenever poss1ble to 1nvolve parents and guard1ans 1n the 
dcc1s1on-makmg process, ensurmg they are educated and mformed about then ch1ld's gender-affmmng care When 
clmrcally appropnate, lmplementlng an mformed consent model allows fol a thorough understand1ng of the potentlal 
beneﬁts, nsks, and altemat1ves assoclated w1th gender-af ﬁrmlng treatments and strengthens the emotronal support system 
that many transgender youth need to 11ve the1r best l1ves poss1ble Furthermore, 1ncreased educat1on and tra1mng for 
healthcare prov1ders, educators, and legrslators are necessary to better understand and support the umque needsof
transgender and gender-nonconformlng youth Addressmg the harmful 1mpact of d1scr1m1nat1on and strgma on transgender 
youth 1s v1tal, and gender-af ﬁnmng care plays a cr1t1cal role 1n m1t1gat1ng these effects It 1s 1mperat1ve that we work to 
remove these barners and ensure that all 11'1d1V1(l1l ﬂlS have access to the gender afﬁrmmg care they need Th1s 1ncludes 
passmg legrslatlon that protects transgender mdrvrduals, especrally youth, from drscnmmatlon 1n healthcare settlngs and 
ensunng that msurance coverage for gender afﬁnmng care 1s comprehensrve and affordable 
Protectmg gender afﬁrmlng care 1s not only a matter of 1nd1v1dual health and well-bemg, but also a matter of human nghts 
and equalxty It’s also a matter of d1gn1ty, respect, and safety New data from The Trevor PI'O]6Cl (2023) from a study of 
more than 28,000 LGBTQ young people (aged 13-24) across the Umted States found that nearly 2 m 3 LGBTQ young 
people sard that hearrng about potentlal state or local laws bamung people from dlscussmg LGBTQ people at school made 
then" mental health a lot worse By support1ng gender-af ﬁnmng care for youth, we are not only promot1ng therr mental and 
physlcal well-bemg, but also fostenng a mo1e 1nclus1ve and compasslonate soc1ety for all who hve, work, and play 1n our 
great State By pass1ng LD 1735, we are sendmg a very strong message to our state’s transgender and gender-dlverse youth 
that they DO belong here 1n Mame I urge th1s comm1ttee to take actlon to protect the nghts of transgender youth and 
ensure that they have access to the care they need to hve full and healthy lrves I want to thank you all for your work on 
th1s lssue Please do not hesltate to reach out to NASW ME for any support we can offer, rncluzdmg any soclal Work 
representatlon and part1c1pat1on 1n any future work sessrons for LD 1735 
Thank you aga1n,
