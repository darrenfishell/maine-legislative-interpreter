INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR THERAPEUTIC AND COUNSELLING CHOICE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO   LD1735, Gender Health Care, 2023-2024   May 11, 2023  
Dear Members of the House Committee on Judiciary,
I am Dr. Laura Haynes, psychologist, general board member, and U.S.A. Country Representative for the International Federation for Therapeutic and Counselling Choice (iftcc.org) that serves professionals in about 25 nations. Thank you for the opportunity to express our deep concerns about LD1735, Gender Health Care. Under ME LD1735, children can be kidnapped by parents who lost custody of their child in another state or can be traﬃcked or be runaways across states lines to Maine if the parent or child is seeking medical gender interventions for the child and the child’s home state does not permit these interventions that can sterilize them. A minor’s gender identity may not last, but the harms of al-tering their bodies can last a lifetime. Please consider the evidence.
1.“Gender identity” is the sex a person subjectively feels they are.  “Incongruent gender identity” is a gender identity that does not match a person’s sex. “Gen-der dysphoria” is the distress a person may feel over the mismatch between their gender identity and their sex. “Medical aﬃrmation” usually is giving pu-berty blockers plus cross sex hormones that can permanently sterilize mi-nors, surgical removal of breasts, and potentially sex surgeries. 2.A minor’s incongruent gender identity may not last. •Children who experience gender dysphoria before puberty overwhelm-ingly—85% to 98%—outgrow gender dysphoria, if not socially or med-ically aﬃrmed to live as another sex, according to 11 our of 11 studies and at least 9 professional organizations, including the Endocrine Society’s Guideline. But if children are socially aﬃrmed to live as another sex for 15 years, only 2.5% resolve. Most go on to be medically sterilized. 2•Even the American Psychological Association’s APA Handbook of Sex-uality and Psychology cautions that the gender aﬃrming approach may neglect individual problems a child is having and risk a child having to go 

through substantial stress in a second gender transition if the incongru-ent gender identity resolves.
3•Regarding adolescents, Sweden, Finland, England, and Norway have 4567now concluded that gender identity, like identity in general, is a tempo-rary search for identity in young people. Young people should not be permanently sterilized based on youthful identities.
3.Gender aﬃrmation—whether social or medical—is a path of serious and lasting harms: •96% to 100% of children who begin with puberty blockers go on to be given cross sex hormones and be sterilized for life    for a gender 891011identity they may have outgrown naturally if not aﬃrmed.
•After young people’s bodies were altered, 30% changed their minds within 4 years and discontinued the drugs despite having full ﬁnancial coverage in a rigorous U.S. population based study. More research has 12had similar ﬁndings.   But the body harms still last a lifetime. 131415•More than 75% of detransitioners did not tell the professionals who medically altered their bodies that they regretted it and detransitioned. Clinicians do not know.
16•Detransitioners grieve permanent losses of their health, ability to pro-create children, ability to function sexually and enjoy orgasm, ability to nurse a baby, and loss of their natural bodies. They face seeking a rela-tionship without having sexual function. 4.Gender aﬃrmation is built on a viewpoint that has never been scientiﬁcally substantiated that a gender identity that diﬀers from a person’s sex is a bio-logical thing, is who a person biologically is. It neglects psychiatric causes. •A highly regarded global consensus statement by endocrine societies around the world on intersex and related conditions rejects a view that incongruent gender identity is an intersex condition of the brain. They said there is no consistent evidence that the brains of gender incongruent people are diﬀerent from the brains of gender congruent people. The 17American Psychiatric Association’s oﬃcial diagnostic manual agrees. 18•At least 14 professional organizations agree that gender identity devel-ops from a mixture of biological, psychological/behavioral, social, and cultural inﬂuences. This is widely accepted. 19•Psychiatric conditions commonly pre-exist gender dysphoria in adoles-cents and may predispose young people to develop gender dysphoria. Rigorous research has found internationally     that a large major2021222324-
ity of adolescents had psychiatric conditions (psychiatric disorders, neu-rodevelopmental disabilities such as autism, self-injuring behavior, suicidali-ty, or confusion about their identity in many areas—not only about gen-der, and trauma from dysfunctional family histories), commonly severe, that frequently began BEFORE onset of gender dysphoria, seldom after, therefore may have led to their gender dysphoria. •The British Psychological Society and American Psychiatric Associa25-tion say an adolescent’s discordant gender identity may be due to a 26psychiatric disorder, and aﬃrmation may not be appropriate. Finland’s government recommends ﬁrst trying to resolve adolescent gender dysphoria by treating predisposing psychiatric disorders. Parents who do not con27-sent to medical interventions may be right about what is best for their child, but LD1735 does not appear to contemplate this. •Research evidence on the safety and eﬀectiveness of medical gender aﬃrming interventions is inconsistent and of low quality according to health authorities in England,  Sweden,      Finland,  28293031323334353637France, Norway, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand, and the En3839404142-docrine Society’s gender guidelines co-sponsored with 6 professional orga-nizations. The most representative studies have found mental health 43problems and suicidality continued at the same rate or even got worse after these treatments.    Maine should not mass produce this. 444546475.It would be dangerous and scientiﬁcally unfounded for politicians to send children down a medical conveyor belt based on a viewpoint that aﬃrmation is in the best interest of a child, a viewpoint on which professionals them-selves worldwide are not in agreement. •The health authorities of Sweden,   Finland, and England   48495051525354are moving away from the aﬃrmative approach. They all conducted re-search reviews and concluded that gender aﬃrmative treatment is experi-mental—not scientiﬁcally supported, and the risks do not outweigh the harms. Norway is the most recent nation to join their caution along with 55medical associations in France, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand.
56575859•Rigorous studies in Sweden  and the Netherlands of all gender dys606162-phoric people in entire national populations over nearly half a century show little to no improvement in suicidality, depression, and anxiety long term  from societal aﬃrmation and medical interference with natural bodies and health. In Sweden, transgender people who got cross sex hormones and surgeries were no better oﬀ in depression, anxiety, or hospitalizations following suicide attempts than those who did not get them. Recent stud63-ies of young people cannot show the long term outcomes in adulthood. •Countries having the longest experience with research and treatment for gender distress that far surpasses that of the United States are prioritiz-ing holistic treatment and psychotherapy over experimental medical af-
ﬁrmation now to resolve child and adolescent gender distress, which LD1735 would very foolishly jeopardize. LD1735 would be a DISASTER. •These nations are moving away from gender aﬃrmative guidelines and positions of those professional organizations that have been captured by biased advocacy science. America is increasingly an outlier on gender treatment. Worldwide, there is NOT a professional consensus in support of LD1735.
6.LD1735, if passed, would end in lawsuits to protect minors and therapists.  
•Maine would be taking upon itself tremendous liability for enticing chil-dren into crossing state lines under perilous circumstances, administer-ing exceedingly high doses of experimental, wrong sex hormones, cut-ting oﬀ breasts, sterilizing young people, and taking away sexual ca-pacity for the rest of their lives for a gender identity they may still out-grow. There will be demands for reparation. Do you want to be respon-sible for this? •Therapists are ethically required to inform clients of alternate therapy options. They must inform clients of the option of noninvasive psy-chotherapy increasingly prioritized in Europe to resolve rather than necessarily aﬃrm gender dysphoria or incongruence or be at risk of lawsuits. Can professionals fulﬁll this ethical obligation in Maine? They must thoroughly inform young people that they are risking their health and giving up sexual capacity for life for gender feelings that may change. How will Maine carry its burden of responsibility for what pro-fessionals do or fail to do? It is currently expected that 1,000 families will sue in England for gender aﬃrming treatment given to minors. A 64lawsuit has already begun in California.  Does Maine want to get on 65this train? •Activists pressuring legislators today for gender aﬃrmation may be su-ing the state tomorrow for promoting it unquestioningly. We urge you, vote NO.Sincerely,Laura Haynes, Ph.D., General Board Member, U.S.A.
