Margaret  Hall
Whiting
LD 1735
Senator Carney and members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Margaret Hall and I live in Whiting, ME. I strongly oppose LD 1735. 
It is self-evident that it is not loving to give children everything they want. Adults 
must guide and protect children, even sometimes denying children things they think 
they want because they are harmful. We have laws that require people to delay 
participation in certain activities until adulthood when development is at stake or is a 
necessary element in the activity. This is reasonable and good. 
The current transgender tsunami is a dangerous social experiment to which we are 
succumbing. Allowing our children to make such life-altering decisions is not wise 
and it is not loving. We are letting them change their bodies forever, when they are 
not allowed to even drive a car or vote in an election. Children need our guidance 
through these difficult phases of development. Some children need adults to deny 
them what they think will be good for them because we have the wisdom to see that it
may very well lead to lifelong regret and inability to participate in one of the most 
fulfilling parts of adulthood - raising your own children. 
Finally, setting ourselves up to be at odds with other states is a terrible idea. Putting 
parental rights in jeopardy across the country is a terrible idea. We need to return to 
common sense and wisdom. I strongly urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1735.
