I am a parent from Indiana and would like to strongly disapprove of this bill. 
Obviously, there are many issues here. The idea that a minor could come to your state
and make such a life changing decision with out parental permission or knowledge is 
beyond what your state should consider. To believe politically inspired educators 
should have this authority is wrong and very frightening to many people, Thank you 
for considering my brief opinion here. Iâ€™m very hopeful that Maine understands that 
this is beyond reasonable activity in a school setting.
