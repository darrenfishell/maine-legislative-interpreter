Before the Judlciary Committee

Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and dlstmgurshed members of the J o1nt Standmg 
Commrttee on Jud1c1ary I am Senator Stacey Guenn and I represent D1str1ct 4, Wh1Ch11'1Cl1ld6S 
all ofP1scataqu1s County and 11 commumtles 1n Penobscot County Please accept my testlmony 
1n oppos1t1on to L D 1735, An Act to Safeguard Gender-a ﬂirmmg Healthcare 
You’ve heard testnnony today of why tlns law should be passed In that test1mony, you’ve heard 
of the wealth of beneﬁts such leg1slat1on would provrde to a small segment of the populatron 
What you d1dn’t hear, however, are the nsks th1s b1ll 1s to our soc1ety 
I W111 rnform you of those soc1etal nsks now 
F1rst,th1s b1ll dlrectly threatens the sanctlty of parental nghts, enshrmed m many of our laws and 
those 1n other states Th1s b1ll not only threatens to destroy those nghts, but also the soc1etal 
fabnc and norms that order our soc1ety Parents and the famlly umt are the foundatronal fabncs 
of our soc1ety 
Second, th1s b1ll rad1cally threatens our systems of due process, law enforcement, and the legal 
system I’ll go 1nto several reasons why 
Q As wntten, the b1llw1ll render any ab1l1ty to enforce Amber Alerts obsolete All a parent 
who has kldnapped a chlld from another state would have to do 1s make 1t to the state 
l1ne, clarm he or she brought the ch1ld here for gender-af ﬁnnmg care, and cla1m asylum 
from the other _|ur1sd1ct1on 
0 It would prevent law enforcement from act1ng on leg1t1mate subpoenas or warrants that 
may not be based on any gender-af ﬁrmmg healthcare slmply by the parent clarmmg 1t 1s 
0 It would encourage at-nsk mmors to ﬂee to Ma1ne for any reason and prevent law 
enforcement from reumﬁcat1on w1th fam1ly slmply by the mlnor clarmmg the reason 1s 
for gender-af ﬁrmmg care Then, the m1nor would be the resp0ns1b1l1ty of Ma1ne 
taxpayers, mclud1ng th1s transrtronal care 
0 For all of the reasons above, we may end up v1olatmg one or more Constltutlonal nghts
‘p 
And thud, I ask Smce when 1s the ster1l1zat1on and mutrlatlon of cluldren ever acceptable ‘? Asa 
soclety, we’ve fought agalnst the persecut1on, dehuman1zat1on, trafﬁckmg and explo1tat1on of 
our prec1ous children across th1s entlre world Honorably, we have developed methods, practlces 
and plnlosoplnes to protect them Why would we allow procedures that cannot eas11y be reversed 
and 1nstead may have hfelong consequences and regret for our cluldren ‘? 
Th1s b1ll W111 do nothmg but pos1t1on the State of Ma1ne as the ch1ld trafﬁckmg caprtal of the 
U S As well 1ntent1oned as the sponsors may be, we need to also be real about 1t 
Please ]o1n me 1n protectmg our ch11dren by oppos1ng L D 1735
