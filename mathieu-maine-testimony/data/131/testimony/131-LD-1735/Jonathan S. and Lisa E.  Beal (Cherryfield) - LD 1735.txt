Regarding LD 1735â€”An Act to Safeguard Gender-Affirming Health Care
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the joint standing 
Committee on the Judiciary:
The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.  
The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
Psalm 37:12-13
The LORD gave children parents to protect them.  Children are not the property of the 
state; nor is it up to teachers, counselors, social workers, doctors, or any other "experts" 
to undermine the parents' authority or encourage a child to be anything other than the 
sex he or she was born to be.  
This bill is not about helping children; it's about aiding and abetting groomers and 
traffickers.  As a dear friend of ours said yesterday, when we are at the point that this is 
what is being brought forth for consideration by our legislators, "God help us all!"
We respectfully submit that each of you must know this bill is evil.  We pray that each of
you will have the courage to STAND and OPPOSE LD 1735 with a vote of NEVER 
IN MY STATE!   (which in legislative terms reads "ought not to pass").  Thank you.
