Maybe some of you aren't old enough to remember when so many people thought 
lobotomies were a good idea to help people feel better.  I knew some of these people, 
personally, as I took care of them in an institution.  How do you say, "I'm sorry!" after
the damage is done and there is no way to make a person whole again?
I'm not sure how we became a nation that believes human experimentation is 
acceptable.  It's rather obvious that anyone who votes for this insanity hasn't done 
research on what happens, medically, to transgenders.  And, wasn't it liberals who 
fought so hard against "genital mutilation?  There are detransitioners who are brave 
enough to describe the horrors that they now have to live with forever.  One is Cloe 
Cole (@ChoooCole on twitter), another calls himself Tullip Richie (@TullipR on 
twitter), another calls himself Shape Shifter (@ShifterofShapes on twitter).  Please 
have the compassion and decency to hear their stories.
