Cherryfield, Maine
LD 1735
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary, 
My name is Marie Wieninger, and I live in Cherryfield, Maine. I am writing to 
strongly urge you to oppose LD 1735. This bill will allow state sanction of child sex 
trafficking and kidnapping. It will also allow and encourage damaging, irreversible 
gender affirming treatments and procedures for underage children. Not only that, but 
it will strip parental rights and enable sex predators. There will be no legal grounds to 
rescue children and protect them from abusers if this bill is passed.
This rainbow cult perversion is highly dangerous to innocent children. It is in 
complete disagreement with the way life should be in Maine, and the work our 
lawmakers have done to protect our children and their safety through the years. It will
destroy young lives and their identity, and not allow them to be who God created 
them to be. I urge you to defend our children and vote against this destructive, 
devastating bill. Thank you.
