LD 1735
I write in opposition to LD 1735, and any subsequent legislation that attempts to sever
or drive a wedge between the parent-child bond, relationship, or open communication 
line. 
Any legislative bill which interferes with the parent-child relationship, while stripping
minors of their legal right to informed consent (e.g. parental notification, feedback or 
advice), is evil and therefore must be destroyed.
Gender dysphoria is a true medical condition, but the struggle to achieve 
self-acceptance (the only issue that really matters) does not go away with pills or 
surgery. 
It is extremely disingenuous for politicians (or medical professionals) to suggest that 
such costly and often irreversible treatments/procedures will lead to happiness or 
self-acceptance.
A few years ago politicians and the medical community wouldn't allow minors to visit
a tanning bed without parental consent and age restrictions, but somehow in 2023 
allowing minors (whose pre-frontal cortexes aren't fully developed until adulthood) 
are able to make permanent medical decisions?!?
I DO NOT support any bill that drives a wedge between the parent-child bond OR 
allows minors to make permanent medical decisions without parental notification and 
consent.
