Maine Parents’ Rights in Education Maine
LD 1735
Sorry, the previous one was a rough draft. 
Testimony of Allen Sarvinas
Parents’ Rights in Education Maine
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs
LD 1735 Ought Not To Pass
May 11, 2023
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and the distinguished members on the 
Committee of Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Allen Sarvinas and I serve 
as director of Parents’ Rights in Education Maine (PRE).  We are a nonpartisan, 
non-profit 501 (c) (3) that advocates for parents’ rights in education.
PRE opposes LD 1735 based upon the lack of data and information that ensures the 
outcomes will not not be additional unintended consequences that disrupt the family 
unit. 
The 14th Amendment of our United States Constitution protects a parent’s right to 
direct the educational upbringing of their child.  This right is as equally protected as a 
minor's right to mental health support, so for out-of-state parents, what is the 
procedure for providing due process while their child is in Maine’s subpar Child 
Protective Services. 
The number one common trend across successful education is the educational 
environment within the home.  LD 1735 incentivizes a situation which immediately 
subverts and irrevocably  harms the value of a child’s education.  This disrupted 
education most likely creates a lifelong dependence on the state from financial to 
health services.  
How do our parents in New Hampshire feel about this legislation? 
We must protect parents’ rights in education and by doing so we are protecting our 
youth and empowering the number one contributor to a successful education.  This 
legislation makes that task much harder forcing us to implore this esteemed 
committee vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 1735.
