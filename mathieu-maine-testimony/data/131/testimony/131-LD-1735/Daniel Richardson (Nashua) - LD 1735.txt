OPPOSING LD1735 
Your bill puts in danger children from NH by way of the absolute madness of 
so-called "gender-affirming care". Your contemplated legalized genital butchery of 
your minors is your perverted business, but disfigurement and permanent genital and 
psychological damage of NH children is not your province. Keep your perverts and 
evil to yourself. If you care at all about humanity stop the insanity and kill this bill.
