Transgender medical care for transgender adolescents and adults 1s safe and effectlve Healthcare 
provlders who speclahze 1n the treatment of gender dysphorla follow standards developed through 
decades of cl1n1ca1 study These well-establlshed standards of care for transgender adolescents 
have been endorsed and adopted by II1El_]01' U S medlcal and mental health assoclatrons 1nclud1ng,
