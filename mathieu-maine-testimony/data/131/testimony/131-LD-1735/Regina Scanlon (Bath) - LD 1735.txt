LD 1735
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
“Gender affirming care” is euphemism for hazardous, irreversible hormone therapy 
and major surgery which permanently removes healthy body parts and massively 
mutilates the human body.  This is horrific with or without parental consent, but now 
LD 1735 wants to take the parents out of the picture when this radical ideology is 
forced on their children by their schools, “councilors”, social media, etc.  Even if a 
parent moves out of a state and tries and raise their children protected from this evil, 
the state of Maine will allow their children to be taken away from them, brought to 
Maine and mutilated.  And on top of all of this, we, the taxpayers, would be forced to 
pay for this!  Unbelievably, this is not dramatic hyperbole, this is what this bill is 
proposing.  
Maine is purportedly “The way life should be.”  With bills such as LD 1735 and LD 
1619 the majority of our current legislature is swiftly morphing our state instead into 
a dystopian nightmare.  Children will be killed in the womb up until BIRTH for ANY 
reason.  Unlicensed abortionists will be simply slapped on the hand, if even that. 
(How can you say you care about women’s health?!)  Children will be taken from 
their parents and given major surgery, massively mutilating them and removing 
completely healthy body parts.  (For contrast … a person under 21 in Maine is not 
even permitted to buy a beer.  A person under 18 is not allowed to have a body 
piercing without their parent’s consent, or buy a cigarette.)  
PLEASE VOTE NO ON LD 1735!  I know many of you are under great pressure to 
vote “yes” for anything related to these radical ideologies, but please, be strong!!!  Be 
courageous!!! Help Maine to be a haven of Goodness, Truth and Love.  The people of
Maine will be behind you!!!
