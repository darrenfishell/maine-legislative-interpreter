Members of the judiciary committee:
I strongly advise that you vote a lot not to pass on 1735 regarding gender, affirming 
health care for out-of-state children. How dare this legislature encourage children 
from other states to come to MAINE  to have their sex changed. Are we encouraging 
parents to leave their states with their children so that Maine will remove sexual 
organs? This is crazy. What is wrong with this state that we would even consider such
a thing?? DONâ€™T WE HAVE MORE CURRENT SURNAME THINGS TO BE 
SPENDING OUR TIME ON THEN THIS RADICAL IDEA?
