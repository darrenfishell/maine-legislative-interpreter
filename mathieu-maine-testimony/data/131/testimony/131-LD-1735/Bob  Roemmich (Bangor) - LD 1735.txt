LD 1735
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary,
My name is Bob Roemmich from Bangor and I am here in OPPOSITION of LD 
1735.  
I have a couple of questions to put to this committee.
First,  no where in the document can I find the definition of a child.  What age group 
are we talking about?  This brings up a couple other minor questions.  What stage of 
childhood development are we addressing?  Is this bill throwing out all childhood 
development out the window?
Second question is what is the State doing to support families and individuals who are
comfortable with their gender at birth? 
This question leads into my next statement.  It appears to me that this bill gives a 
higher standing to a minority group and takes resources and pass laws supporting a 
specific minority group with no benefits to society at large.
This bill also shows that the state is going toward being a sanctuary state for criminals
from medical malpractice laws to abortions.
Does Maine want to be considered the “Sanctuary” state for the east coast?
Thank you for your time and I am willing to take any questions
Respectfully submitted,
Bob Roemmich
