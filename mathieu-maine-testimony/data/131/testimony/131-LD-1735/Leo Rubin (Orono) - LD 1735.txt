Dear
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee.
I
support
LD
1735
an
act
to
Safeguard
Gender -af firming
Health
Care.”
My
name
is
Leo,
and
I
am
an
out-of-state
student
at
the
University
of
Maine,
and
I
am
writing
to 
show
support
for
LD
1735
“An
Act
to
Safeguard
Gender -af firming
Health
Care”.
I
was
able
to
start
gender -af firming
care
in
Maine
without
fear
of
persecution
for
doing
such.
I 
was
able
to
be
a
student,
learn,
and
not
fear
a
lack
of
access
to
my
medication.
Currently ,
not
all 
students
are
able
to
say
the
same.
An
out-of-state
student
from
Missouri
who
needs
this
sort
of 
medical
care
should
not
be
risking
arrest
while
in
the
state
of
Maine,
where
it
is
completely
legal.
Many
of
the
anti-transgender
bills
that
have
been
passed
in
other
states
tar get
minors.
The 
younger
freshmen
arrive
at
the
university
at
17
years
old,
meaning
that
they
will
be
af fected
by 
these
bills
in
their
home
states.
However ,
LD
1735
will
prevent
this
from
happening.
Maine
has
been
known
and
is
a
leader
in
welcoming
queer
people
nationally .
This
bill
is
a 
reasonable
next
step
in
continuing
this
path
of
leadership
and
equality .
Because
of
this
state’ s 
leadership,
this
will
signal
to
other
states
that
are
friendly
to
transgender
people
to
also
create 
a
sanctuary
for
those
that
need
it.
Maine
is
a
great
state,
and
this
will
only
make
it
better .
Please
vote
in
support
of
LD
1735
to 
protect
those
that
are
already
being
mar ginalized
by
their
homes,
and
allow
Maine
to
be
their 
new
home
without
fear
of
criminalization.
