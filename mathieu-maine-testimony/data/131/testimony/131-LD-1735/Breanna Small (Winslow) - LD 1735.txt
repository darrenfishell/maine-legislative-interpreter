Breanna Small
Winslow
LD 1735
Madam/Mister Chair & Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Breanna Small and I am a resident of Winslow Maine, and I am writing 
today in opposition to LD1735.
This bill would allow a violation of human rights as children cannot consent to cross 
sex hormones and sterilization. Children do not have the fully developed brain 
capacity to undertake permanent sterilization. A nine year old cannot drink an 
alcoholic beverage because of the damage it can do to their underdeveloped brains, 
and yet they are allowed to take a cocktail of drugs and pills and gender hormones. 
Most children outgrow gender dysphoria before the age of 18, so why are we allowing
them to make the choice to remove their reproductive organs before they are even old 
enough to know what that means?
I am a parent of a toddler who likes to tell me that he’s a semi truck, and is fully 
convinced he is a semi truck. 
I am not replacing his eyes with headlights or his hands and feet with wheels, so why 
are we sterilizing children who tell us they are a different gender? 
This bill is evil, and abusive, and I urge you to vote “ought not to pass”.
