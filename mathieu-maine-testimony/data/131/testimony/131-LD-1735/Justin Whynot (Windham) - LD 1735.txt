Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, and esteemed members of the Judiciary Committee, 
l am Justin Whynot, a father and grandfather from Vlﬁndham, lifelong resident of Maine, and 
Co-Director of Parents Rights Maine l am here in opposition of LD 1735 
This bill would not only put Maine's children at nsk, it would potentially affect minors all over the 
United States This legislation would tum Maine into a sanctuary state for transitioning minors, 
bypassing laws in their parents‘ home states LD1735 would allow Maine children to be taken 
from their homes if parents refuse elective surgenes, phamiaceuticals, or other procedures for 
their children These procedures are known to have lasting detrimental effects on an individual ’s 
physical, emotional and mental health. 
LD1735 would also place “handcuffs ” on Maine law enforcement agencies when assisting with 
minors who run away from their homes Law enforcement efforts could be halted whena 
non-custodial parent takes a minor from their home Maine's Judicial system works diligently to 
ensure mnors are in a healthy environment, but this bill would undermine those eﬁorts by 
removingiheenfcrcementsldeof Mainelscustodlal laws. 'lThestateofMainecouldultimate1ybe

precedents set in ensuring the well-being of minors and the rights oflVlaine ’s parents 
Pemoving children from their family, especially when they’re in a vulnerable and confused state, 
would have lasting, harmful, psychological affects to the children of Maine Maine’s children are 
already burdened by complex emotional issues Please don't add to the seventy of this problem 
by allowing the state to remove children from their homes for being refused irreversible 
surgenes and treatments Or by tying the hands of Maines dedicated law-enforcement agencies 
which play a vital part in protecting the physical, emotional and mental health of Maine’s 
children 
That's why l'm here today to ask you to vote to not pass LD1735. Thank you for your time and 
consideration 
Justin Whynot
