My name is Nicholas Sevos, and I am a resident of Searsport. This proposition before 
us is nothing short of evil. "Gender affirming care" is nothing short of mutilation of 
children. Willfully allowing, confirming, and supporting this is unconscionable. You 
are doing no good for this child by doing so, only mutilating their young bodies into 
something that will not never become what it is meant to be, and won't even be able to
be surgically transformed into the twisted caricatures of men and women that you 
foolishly think they become. Early "gender affirming care" prevents, for example, a 
boys penis from growing to it's natural size which in turn prevents a twisted physician
from surgically altering it into a faux vagina, so that when this poor child is an adult, 
they can neither live as a man or woman and will most likely join the literally 42% of 
transgender people who commit suicide. Additionally, in what sane world would you 
allow a CHILD to make such decisions about themselves, a parent to mutilate a 
child's healthy body, or a doctor to take part in this abomination? Have you no soul, 
no sense of right and wrong? This is twisted and evil, there is no defense and no logic 
in this choice. Those who support this nonsense have, in my opinion, no honor or 
decency to speak of and I pray they will turn from this evil and realize the error of 
their ways. This is one of those moments in life wherein you, as a man or woman, will
have to make a clear decision as to what you see as right and wrong. SIMPLY NOT 
VOTING OR ABSTAINING IS NOT ENOUGH OF A REBUKE. You must firmly 
state NO to this evil.
