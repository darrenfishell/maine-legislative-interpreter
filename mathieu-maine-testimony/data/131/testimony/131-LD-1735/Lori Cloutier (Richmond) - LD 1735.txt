Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Hello, My name IS Lon Cloutier and I live in Richmond . 
LD 1735. An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming 
Health Care.‚Äù 
Here we are again. Yet, another extreme bill that we 
here in Maine refuse to support. Why is it we are so 
hell bent on making Maine a safe haven for mothers 
to murder their child (LD 1619) and allow doctors 
fleeing from other states protection into possible 
violations of such laws.(todays bill LD 1735).. 
* This policy is unconstitutional. 
* This bill would make Maine the most radical 
sanctuary state for gender surgeries not approved 
by parents. 
*This bill legalizes and protects kidnapping in Maine. 
It is unbelievable that adults would actually approve 
this. This is where America has come? 
It takes a lot of courage and strength to discern 
these recent bills being presented to you, I thank 
you for listening and urge you to oppose LD 1735.
\
This bill is inhumane strips parents of their 
constitutional rights, and endangers children 
The people of Maine support you, 
Thank you. 
Lori Cloutier
