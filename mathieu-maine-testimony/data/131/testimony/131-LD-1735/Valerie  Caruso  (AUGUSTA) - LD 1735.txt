LD 1735
I am moving to Maine next month from NH. I am a school psychologist for over 33 
years. Being a school psychologist means I know about psychological disorders, child
development, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning,  child 
maltreatment, educational practices, and most importantly the appropriate 
socialization of children. 
Several years ago I taught a community college class about Child Abuse and Neglect. 
At the time, pedophile priests were being exposed and the corruption of the Catholic 
Church to hide sexual abusers. After this horrific and necessary exposure of evil in the
church (I am a cradle Catholic), I had to take a course about being a mandated 
reporter (even though I knew that as a professional), in order to teach religious 
education and how pedophiles groom their victims and were successful in keeping 
their victims hidden from their parents under the guise of helping a needy child. 
THIS BILL IS THE SAME EVIL AGAINST CHILDREN. I THOUGHT I HAVE 
SEEN AND HEARD OF THE WORST OF THE WORST IN OUR SOCIETY BUT 
THIS IS THE BEYOND ANYTHING I COULD HAVE IMAGINED!!
  NOT ONLY IS IT IMMORAL AND AN INDICATION OF SERIOUS 
SOCIOPATHIC MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE SPONSORS AND CO-SPONSORS , 
IT IS IRRATIONAL AND WRONG BECAUSE:
1)A CHILD (UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE) IS NOT A KNOWLEDGEABLE  
PATIENT WHO CAN MAKE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES; 
WHERE IS THE PRECEDENT FOR THIS? THEY DO NOT HAVE THE 
INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY TO WEIGH PROS AND CONS OF THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF AGREEING TO IRREVERSIBLE MEDICAL MUTILATION 
AND DISRUPTION OF THEIR NATURAL GROWTH PROCESS AS A MALE OR
FEMALE.
2) IT IS AGAINST EVERYTHING WE HAVE EVER DONE IN EDUCATION 
AND HEALTHCARE BY REMOVING PARENTS FROM THE DECISION AND 
GIVING IT TO THE STATE. 
3)THIS IS STATE SANCTIONED SEX TRAFFICKING.
THINK THIS THROUGH TO EITHER YOUR INTENDED OR UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCES OF FURTHER VICTIMIZATION OF CHILDREN
4) THERE MUST BE A MONETARY INCENTIVE FOR THIS BILL  AND 
EVENTUALLY  IT WILL BE EXPOSED. BLOOD MONEY.
5) YOU SPONSORS ARE WOLVES IN SHEEPS CLOTHING. YOU ARE 
IMPOSING  YOUR OWN SICKNESS ONTO THE INNOCENT.  WE SEE YOU 
FOR WHO ARE AND SO DOES GOD.
6) CHILDREN WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT 
ACCOMPANIES GENDER DYSPHORIA WILL NEVER GET THE PROPER 
HELP THEY NEED BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. THEY DO NOT NEED GENDER 
AFFIRMING CARE. THEY NEED HEALING FROM THE INSIDE.  NO PILLS 
OR SURGERIES CAN FIX A TRAUMATIC BRAIN  A BROKEN MIND AND 
HEART FROM ABUSE, LOSS, AND LACK OF LOVE. 
7) YES I DISAGREE WITH THE STATE AND NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL 
PSYCH ORGANIZATIONS WHO BACK BILLS LIKE THIS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. THEY ARE LEMMINGS WHO CANT THINK FOR THEMSELVES 
AND OFTEN PROJECT THEIR GOD COMPLEX ONTO THEIR WORK.
Lastly I am so grateful that our children are grown now . I do not want grandchildren 
if they are to be raised in this society of evil. I am so sad to see that Maine is like 
California with DEMONcratic leaders who are immoral sociopaths. However I am 
going to speak out for the children of Maine and fight this war starting with this BILL
