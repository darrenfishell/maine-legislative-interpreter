LD 1735
Chairs and Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
I am writing in opposition to LD 1735, an Act to safeguard Gender affirming Health 
Care.
This bill is fundamentally evil. It's purpose is to separate parents from children. Many 
children will end up in foster care. So many have testified to great sexual abuse in the 
system.  It is about transgender trafficking, not different than any other form of 
trafficking. Puberty blockers alone will create a slow down of natural progression of 
physical and emotional growth. Mental stability will become a major issue. This bill 
is insane! Why are the Dems so hell bent on destroying this generation? Vote ought 
not to pass on LD 1735.
Sincerely outraged,
Renee Fortin
