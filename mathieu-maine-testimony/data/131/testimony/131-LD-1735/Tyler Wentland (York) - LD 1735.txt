To
the
Judiciary
Committee:
Are
parents
the
guardians
and
caregivers
of
their
children?
The
Maine
Judiciary
Committee
will
want
to
ask
that
question
as
it
debates
LD
1735
to
determine
whether
the
state
has
the
right
to
step
in
between
nonresident
parents
and
their
children
who
will
be
invited
to
Maine
for
‘gender-affirming
care’
if
this
bill
becomes
law.
‘Care’
that
many
of
those
parents
would
define
as
disfigurement,
chemical
castration,
and
sex-change-surgeries
for
children
too
young
to
consent
to
puberty
blockers
or
understand
the
implications
of
such
interventions.
Passing
this
bill
would
place
the
state
firmly
between
those
parents
and
that
minor
while
using
state
funding
to
pay
for
this
‘care,’
just
as
is
being
debated
regarding
Maine
parents
with
Ch.
117.
By
what
standard
do
Representatives
Osher,
Milliken,
Moonen,
Salisbury,
Sheenan,
Worth,
and
Senator
Carney,
judge
themselves
and
their
peers
better
guardians
and
caregivers
of
the
nation's
gender
dysphoric
youth
than
the
parents
of
those
minors?
Is
it
the
observable
fruits
reaped
by
more
progressive/egalitarian
nations
that
have
preceded
the
US
in
these
practices?
Consider
that
the
credibility
of
the
‘gender-affirming’
model
is
very
quickly
being
abandoned
by
nations
such
as
England
and
Sweden
along
with
relevant
therapies
and
clinics
because
they
have
done
far
more
harm
than
good
(“The
NHS
Ends”)
(“Sweden”).
Sweden
is
ranked
by
Pew
as
one
of
the
most
egalitarian
countries
on
the
face
of
the
earth
with
England
only
2
places
behind
(Rosenberg).
Is
it
improved
mental
health
outcomes?
Consider
a
2021
study
by
the
Department
of
Defense
which
showed
that
“trans-identified
youth
did
not
experience
improved
mental
health
after
hormone
therapy
but
instead
increased
their
prescriptions
for
psychotropic
medicine”
due
to
deteriorating
mental
health
(Ashton).
Is
it
improved
biological
health
outcomes?
Consider
the
forearms
of
young
girls
stripped
nearly
to
the
bone
in
effort
to
harvest
enough
flesh
to
create
an
ornamental
but
inoperative
phallus.
Or
the
young
man
put
on
puberty
blockers
as
a
child
who
never
grows
enough
penile
tissue
required
to
create
a
neo-vagina,
and
so
undergoes
surgery
to
harvest
a
section
of
his
bowel
to
create
the
desired
cavity.
An
18-year-old
Dutch
male
recently
died
after
contracting
necrotizing
fasciitis
days
after
this
very
surgery
was
performed
for
this
very
reason
(Ashton).
One
can
pepper
these
extreme
examples
with
increased
rates
of
osteoporosis,
cancers,
castration,
and
sterilization
as
a
result
of
this
‘care’
(“Managing”)
(Lancet).
This
begs
the
question:
if
these
practices
are
not
yielding
improved
mental
or
physical
health
outcomes
for
minors,
yet
the
state
is
s t i l l
considering
such
practices
worth
pursuing
and
implementing
against
parental
approval,
I
would
question
whether
putting
such
an
entity
in
place
of
a
child’s
parents
is
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
History
and
common
sense
would
agree
that
peaceful,
stable
societies
are
built
on
strong
families,
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances,
consisting
of
parents
raising
their
biological
children
(Wilcox).
Governmental
disruption
of
that
relationship
will
inevitably
lead
at
the
micro-level
to
individual
children
damaged
both
physically
and
psychologically,
and
at
the
macro-level
increased
civil
unrest,
institutional
distrust,
and
cultural
deterioration.
Study
after
study
demonstrates
that
children
do
better
by
all
metrics
living
with
their
biological
parents
and
are
at
“far
greater
risk
when
living
in
a
household
with
adults
unrelated
to
them”
(Stiffman).
Children
who
grow
up
without
both
of
their
biological
parents
are
more
likely
to
end
up
addicted,
imprisoned,
depressed,
suicidal,
participate
in
high-risk
behaviors,
experience
financial
hardship,
live
shorter
lives,
and
have
children
out
of
wedlock,
starting
the
cycle
over
again
(Soomar)
(ibid).
Yet
familial
disruption
and
the
‘gender-affirming’
path
is
being
pursued
despite
the
fact
that
60-90%
of
children
suffering
with
gender
dysphoria
will
desist
and
feel
comfortable
in
their
own
bodies
by
puberty
(Soh
141-149).
This
last
point
is
of
particular
importance
given
a
landmark
study
that
showed
“[t]en
to
15
years
after
surgical
reassignment,
the
suicide
rate
of
those
who
had
undergone
sex-reassignment
surgery
rose
to
20
times
that
of
comparable
peers”
(Anderson)
(
Dhejne
).
This
means
that
the
“treatment”
that
the
Maine
legislature
has
proposed
offering
the
nation’s
children
i n c r e a s e s
suicidal
tendencies,
rather
than
decreases
them,
in
a
population
the
majority
of
whom
would
grow
comfortable
in
their
own
bodies
if
they
were
allowed
to
reach
natural
puberty.
All
at
a
time
where
youth
are
particularly
vulnerable
as
sadness,
depression,
and
suicide
have
skyrocketed
(Akkas)
(“U.S.
Teen
Girls”).
Perhaps
the
goal
of
the
legislature
is
spiritual
in
nature.
Consider
that
OUT
Maine,
a
group
listed
as
a
resource
on
the
Maine
Dept
of
Education
website
defines
gender
as
“[a]
social
construct
based
on
emotional,
behavioral,
and
cultural
characteristics
attached
to
a
person’s
sex
assigned
at
birth.
Gender
has
several
components,
including
gender
identity,
gender
expression,
and
gender
role”
(“LGBTQ+”).
They
define
Gender
Identity
as
the
“internal
sense
of
who
they
are
in
regard
to
gender,
regardless
of
their
sex
assigned
at
birth”
(Ibid).
When
put
together
we
get
“the
internal
sense
of
who
they
are
in
regard
to
their
emotional,
behavioral,
and
cultural
characteristics
attached
to
their
sex
assigned
at
birth.”
While
it
is
debatable
whether
this
definition
adequately
defines
Gender,
it
does
clearly
distinguish
gender
from
sex
which
is
defined
as
“either
of
the
two
main
categories
(male
and
female)
into
which
humans
and
most
other
living
things
are
divided
on
the
basis
of
their
reproductive
functions”
(“Definition”).
If
sex
is
distinguished
from
gender
by
biological
materiality
and
gender
is
defined
as
an
“internal
sense”
but
separate
from
the
body,
it
reads
as
if
what
is
being
described
is
a
soul
or
similar
spiritual
reality
understood
as
intrinsic
to
the
body
but
separate
from
it.
If
that
is
the
case
the
state
has
begun
treading
into
theological
territory
which
would
be
ascribing
a
physical
solution
to
a
spiritual
problem.
This
would
be
like
affirming
those
suffering
from
bulimia
or
anorexia
in
their
delusion
that
they
are
overweight
and
offering
them
liposuction
or
stomach
stapling
as
a
solution
to
their
psychological
pain.
As
an
aside,
the
state
taking
such
a
spiritual
position
in
the
debate
raises
questions
regarding
the
U.S.
Constitution’s
separation
of
church
and
state.
If
the
standard
by
which
the
Representatives
and
the
Senator
are
making
judgment
is
not
based
on
outcomes
of
mental
health,
biological
health,
societal
health,
familial
health,
personal
health,
spiritual
health,
or
scientific
consensus,
then
I
am
perplexed.
If
there
is
a
moral
standard
by
which
such
a
judgment
is
being
made,
I
am
curious
to
know
by
w h a t
moral
standard
the
Representatives
and
Senator
deem
such
a
bill
morally
“correct,”
and
worth
proposing
to
the
legislature
in
spite
of
the
empirical
evidence
to
the
contrary?
No
child
is
born
in
the
wrong
body.
No
child
is
a
broken
thing
to
be
“fixed”.
Every
child
is
beautiful
and
worth
protecting.
This
bill
does
the
exact
opposite
of
that
by
proposing
the
state
disrupt
the
most
important
relationship
in
our
society
on
the
impossible
assumption
that
its
legislators
know
each
individual
child
better
than
those
who
birth,
nurture,
raise,
and
love
them
until
death.
The
same
people
who
will
have
to
pick
up
the
pieces
left
over
when
those
children
later
regret
the
irreversible
damage
done
by
surgeries
and
hormones
administered
under
the
purview
of
the
state,
as
we
see
with
detransitioners
speaking
out
today
(Pollock).
No
state
will
ever
love
a
child
more
than
their
parents
do.
I
appreciate
your
attention.
