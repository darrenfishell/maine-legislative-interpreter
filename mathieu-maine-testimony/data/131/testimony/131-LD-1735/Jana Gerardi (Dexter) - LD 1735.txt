Good afternoon.
My name is Jana Gerardi and I am from Dexter, Maine. Please oppose LD 1735.
To begin with, gender-affirming “care” is not truly care. It is one of the most 
far-reaching ways of yielding to one’s delusion because it flies in the face of reality. 
One’s gender is not assigned at birth; it is merely a recognition of what is and always 
has been a reality.
Those in leadership and influential positions such parents, teachers, medical 
professionals, and political leaders must show our young people their place in reality. 
We must model and teach that feelings must be tempered and governed with the 
fixed, unchanging truth.
Out of all these key figures, parents have a moral obligation to care for, love, train, 
and provide frontline protection for their children. This bill prevents parents from 
fulfilling this duty.
Studies show that the transgender affirming medical interventions damage children’s 
health and cause major problems for the rest of their lives. In addition, more than 50%
of youth claiming to be trans or non-binary considered suicide in 2022, and that 
transgender teens are 7.6 times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.
Perhaps the reason for this host of issues is because our young people are trying to be 
something that they were never designed or intended to be: the opposite sex, or 
something in between.
By making the state of Maine a “safe place” to get the gender-affirming counseling 
and medical interventions, we are no doubt going to add to the statistics shown above.
Please oppose LD 1735.
