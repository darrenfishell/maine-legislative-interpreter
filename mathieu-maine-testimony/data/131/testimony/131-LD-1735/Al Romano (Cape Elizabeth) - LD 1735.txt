LD 1735 - Ought NOT to Pass
The State of Maine should not insert itself between parents/guardians of a child from 
another US home state struggling with a response to gender dysphoria.  The bill does 
not differentiate between a child of 4 years and a child of 17 years.  The bill ought not
to pass.
