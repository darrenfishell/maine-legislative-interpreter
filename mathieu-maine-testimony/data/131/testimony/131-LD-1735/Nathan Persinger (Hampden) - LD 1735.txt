LD 1735
Dear Judiciary Committee Members,
Please vote Ought NOT to Pass on LD 1735. This bill is downright dangerous as it 
tries to legalize kidnapping for the purpose of receiving gender-affirming therapy 
(reference Sec. 8. 19-A MRSA ยง1752, sub-ยง4 "a court may not consider as a factor 
weighing against the petitioner any taking of the child, or retention of the child after a 
visit or other temporary relinquishment of physical custody, from the person who has 
legal custody, if there is evidence that the taking or retention of the child was for the 
purposes of obtaining gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health 
care for the child). 
This wicked bill also allows the courts to take custody of a child if his/her parent(s) 
don't consent to gender-affirming care (reference Sec. 6. 19-A MRSA ยง1748, sub-ยง1 
"A court of this State has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in 
this State and...the child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care or 
gender-affirming mental health care."). 
The truth is that all children belong to God. God creates these children and grants 
them to their parents, who have the God-given right and responsibility for the welfare 
of the children. That authority does not, and should not, rest with the state concerning 
matters of gender therapy. This bill is terrible for Maine and even worse for Maine 
children. Please vote Ought NOT to Pass.
