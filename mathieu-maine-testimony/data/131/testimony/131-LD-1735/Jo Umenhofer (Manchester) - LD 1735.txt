LD 1735
The rendering of the language of this bill is a horrific offense to the establishment of 
family as well as to what government is defined to be. Government was intended to 
help the family,  not tear it apart through legislation that borders on encouraging 
kidnapping,  all in the name of a cultural issue.  LD1735 reads as though the intention 
is to protect, but instead encourages the destruction of the integrity of family and 
parental rights. The government,  not in any of the Bill of Rights or our National or 
State Constitutions was meant to hold the powers this bill is attempting to provide it.  
For the families of Maine and all of New England, I submit this testimony in 
opposition to LD1735.It is my hope that as legislators of the State,  you would read 
through this blurring of the lines that intends to ruin and diminish the honor,  
responsibilities,  and duties of both the family unit and our governmental structure. If 
legality is given to the atrocities suggested in this bill, we will have then failed to 
protect our children and the future generations of the great State of Maine.
