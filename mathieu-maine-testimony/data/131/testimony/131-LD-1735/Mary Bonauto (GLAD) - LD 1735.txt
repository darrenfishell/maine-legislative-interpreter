Re LD T735, An Act to Safeguard Gendel r-aﬂirmmg hcealth Care - OTP 
Dear Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and Members of the Commlttee on Jud1c1ary 
GLAD, together w1th the ACLU of Mame, the Mame Women’s Lobby and Out Mame, 
strongly supports LD 1735 We thank Representatlve Osher, Senator Carney, Representatlve 
M1ll1ken, Representatrve Moonen, Representatwe Salrsbury, Representatlve Brddeford, and 
Representatlve Worth for br1ng1ng forth th1s trmely b1ll'

Access to medrcally necessary, best-practlce health care 1s central to the Well-belng of all 
people and communltles 1n Ma1ne We appreclate the hard work of Mame, health care pI‘OV1dCI'S 
to care for people across the state, through many and ongomg challenges, to keep the people of 
Mame healthy Q,
\ 
Ma1ne, too, has a deep commrtment to falrness and equalrty for all people, 1nclud1ng 
rat1ﬁcat1on of a ballot measure 1n 2005 to mclude transgender people 1n our nond1scr1m1nat1on 
laws, and to recogn1ze transgender people are v1tal parts of our fam1l1es and commun1t1es w1th 
respect to state 1dent1ﬁcat1on and forms, name changes, and addresslng healthcare needs 
Together, we have taken thoughtful steps’to mclude transgender people 1n our shared goal of 
bu1ld1ng an 1nclus1ve, thr1v1ng state1 
Through LD 1735, Marne would act to shreld Ma1ne prov1ders, patlents, and valuesfrom the 
threats posted by cruel and harmful actlons 1n other states to restrlct, c1v1lly and cr1m1nally, 
access to transgender health care State bans on transgender health care have been passmg th1s 
year at an alarm1ng rate \ I 
LD 1735 s1gnals that our state w1ll use 1ts resources (l) to ensure that mdivlduals, not the 
govermnent, are the ones makmg dec1s1ons about the1r own healthcare and well-belng and (2) to 
ensure that patrents and provlders are shielded as much as posslble from unfounded efforts to 
restnct or cr1m1nal1ze v1tal evldence-based health care when 1t 1s prov1ded1n Ma1ne ,
1 
The goals of th1s b1ll are so 1mportant at th1s t1me when transgender people and the1r fam111es 
are facmg unprecedented attacks 1n other states, most concermngly bans on medlcal care For

example, Alabama enacted a lawz that makes 1t a felony w1th a pOS\ S1bl6 ten-year pr1son sentence 
for a prov1der, parent, or anyone who ass1sts a young person accessmg medlcally necessary 
transgender-related health care serv1ces As of th1s wr1t1ng, 18 states have banned access to 
transgender care, 1nclud1ng Alabama, Ar1zona, Arkansas, F londa, Georgla, Idaho, Iowa, 1 
Indlana, Kentucky, M1ss1ss1pp1, M1ssour1, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, 
Tennessee, Utah, an/d West V1rg1n1a, and l6 of these bans passed 1n 2023 alone 3 
Th1s 
represents an alarm1ng lncrease on the rate of attacks on transgender people and thelr prov1ders 
Many states are actlng to protect the1r resldents and health care systems so that people can 
get the effect1ve and somet1mes l1fe-sav1ng care they need On May 10, w1th Governor Scott’s 
s1gn1ng of H 89/ S 37, Vermont became the 15"‘ state to enact a “shleld” law to protect access 
to health care, pratrents, and prov1ders 4 Those ﬁfteen states mclude n1ne states wrth expl1c1t 
protect1ons for transgender health care (Vermont, Colorado, Callfornla, Massachusetts,/ 
Mrnnesota, New Mexlco, Washmgton, Connectlcut, and Ill1no1s)5
, 
It 1s rmportant for Mame to enact a shreld b1ll to protect prov1ders, patrents, and access to 
health care 1n our state As currently draﬂed, th1s b1ll provrdes that (1) Mame court and law‘- 
enforcement resources w1ll not be used to further state bans on transgender health care that are 
tryrng to mtrude 1nto Mame and 1nﬂ1ct c1v1l and cnmmal l1ab1l1t1es on Ma1ne health care 
prov1ders who p1‘0V1Cl6 care that 1s legal 1n Mame, medrcally necessary for the 1nd1v1dual, and 1s 
the establ1shed standard of care, (2) Ma1ne courts are able to take temporary emergency 
]ur1sd1ct1on to protect ch1ldren ’s access to health' 
care, and (3) Ma1ne health care prov1ders do not 
have to dlsclose pnvate health lnformatron of patrents 1n resp’onse to efforts of other states to 
enforcebans on health care that'1s legal 1n ‘Mame 
Grven the el1m1nat1on of vltal health care 1n a number of states, and to keep our own health 
care system robust, 1t 1s lmportant that the Ma1ne shleld law to be clear and comprehens1ve In 
our v1ew, LD 1 735 would beneﬁt ﬂom amendments to ensure 1t reﬂects protect1ons evldent 1n 
sh1eld laws recently passed such as Vermont H 89 We look forward to work1ng wlth the 
sponsor, Rep Osher, the other sponsors and 1nterested partres on amendments to ensure th1s 
shreld law meets th1s d1re moment, 1s adapted to Ma1ne’s needs, and comprehensrvely protects 
prov1ders and pat1ents so that Mame 1s shrelded from the 1ntrus1on of other states’ bans Those 
amendments mclude , 
0 Prov1s1ons to ensure prov1ders are not Sllb_]CC1I6d to rate lncreases or changes 1n 
malpractlce msurance coverage on the basls of prov1d1ng transgender health care 
0 Prov1s1ons to ensure prov1ders do not lose therr Mame lrcenses or face d1sc1pl1ne 1n 
Ma1ne for prov1d1ng transgender health care
