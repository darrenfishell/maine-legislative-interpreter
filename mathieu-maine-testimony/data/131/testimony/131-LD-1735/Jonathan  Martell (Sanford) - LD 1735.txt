Memorandum of Opposition 
Date:  May 12, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Judiciary. 
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE: LD 1735 An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Health Care 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Opposition  of LD 1735 An Act to Safeguard Gender-
affirming Health Care 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, and lifelong resident of Maine.   
 
I'm almost at a loss for words with what I'm reading in this bill. Is the intent really to allow for kidnapping of 
children from another state for gender transition medical procedures that include everything up to surgery to 
remove breasts or other reproductive organs? This amounts to legalized kidnapping and mutilation of children.  
Personally, I don't know how any member of this committee can sleep at night even contemplating something 
this heinous.  
Section 4 talks about sharing investigation information with out of state entities with patient consent. We're 
talking about children under 18. They are unable to give consent in most cases.  
 
Section 6 is making the claim that the child is the same as abandoned in this state if they were able to be 
mutilated in their state. This is not the same as someone leaving a child at a rest stop. This is allowing 
kidnapping by anyone for any reason if they decide to bring a child here for child mutilation purposes.  
 
It also appears that the child can be forced to stay here as long as the kidnapper pleases. The court will not even 
recognize the out of state court.  
 
The same people that are so worried about children when it comes to firearms laws, can't kill them fast enough 
in the womb, or mutilate the ones that survive.  
 
Please recognize this for what it is, and vote ought not to pass.   
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor
