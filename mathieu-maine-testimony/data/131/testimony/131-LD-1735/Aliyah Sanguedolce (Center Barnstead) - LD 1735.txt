I am a mother of two who has been following this issue for some time now. After 
watching a couple videos on YouTube my son came up to me and said “mama  amI a 
girl?” In the sweetest little boy voice one can imagine. I found that the video had been
a blues clues episode that featured a drag queen and a new rainbow puppy to go along
with it. The topics of discussion were not appropriate for kids and my son would have
never thought that if someone didn’t first put that in his head. Along with every other 
concerned parent, I quickly explained that you cannot choose what you were born as, 
but you can work on things if you feel uncomfortable in your own body. My children 
are just that, mine, and I will have the final say in what happens with them period.
