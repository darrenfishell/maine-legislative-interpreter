The following bills ought-NOT-to pass as they constitute child trafficking and 
endangerment as well as promote coercion,intimidation and harm to children. 
One does not constitute medical care, but medical mutilation. 
If these bills pass, one day these days will be looked upon as a travesty perpetrated on
children in the name of profit and political heresy.
Thank you.
