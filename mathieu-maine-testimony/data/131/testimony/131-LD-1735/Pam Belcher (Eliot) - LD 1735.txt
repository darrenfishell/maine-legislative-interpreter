*Children* are not allowed to drive until they are 16. They are not allowed to vote 
until they are 18. They are not allowed in the military until they are 18. They are not 
allowed to smoke until they are 18. They are not allowed to drink alcohol until they 
are 21. Why? Because they are not mentally mature enough to make decisions that 
could negatively affect their health and physical growth. The decision making area of 
the brain, ie risk analysis, is not fully developed until our mid- to late twenties. Which
is why teenagers participate in riskier behaviors, and do things they wouldnâ€™t consider
once they are in their thirties and beyond. 
How can a *child* determine that they need life altering, irreversible surgery? How 
can a *child* cross state lines for initial surgery, hormone blockers and other 
medicine and follow up care and appointments, when their home state rightly prevents
them from having these procedures? Maine should not be a destination for the genital 
mutilation of children. Let them wait until they grow up and mature naturally and can 
make that decision as an adult - age 21.
