Transgenderism is a religion that teaches that children are born with immutable 
gendered souls, or gender identities, that manifest themselves through 
gender-stereotypical behavior. According to Jeremy Carswell, the head of Boston 
Children’s Hospital’s gender clinic, if your three-year-old son fights getting a haircut 
or daughter tries to pee standing up, or either of them play with opposite gender toys, 
they might be trans and need to be treated by the hospital staff.
Any effort to change a child’s gender identity or even a failure to recognize and 
celebrate it, will result in suicide, but it’s OK, even essential, to modify his body with 
chemicals and surgery to try to make it match the authentic self.
The fact that Transgenderism is a religion makes it much more dangerous and 
difficult to address. If we were discussing transgenderism only as public policy, we 
could discuss a few of the tenets -  what is a transgender child, how can a girl who has
never been a boy identify as a boy, and what is a boy anyway? - and the ideology 
would evaporate in the light of reason.
Transgenderism has become the established religion of academia, major medical 
societies, and an entire political party, and public policies and even scientific research 
are only valid to the degree they support the narrative that children can be born in the 
wrong body.
