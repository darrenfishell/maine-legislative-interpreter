RE:  LD1735
Dear Committee Members,
My husband and I are writing to you to ask you not to pass the bill LD1735.  Please 
do not confuse our children  or take away parental rights anymore than has already 
been done in Maine.  God created all of us as a man or woman.  If you allow the 
minority to continue to confuse the situation with their ideals, you will be going 
against God and He is not the author of confusion.  
Our children need to to be protected, loved, trained and educated in a mature way that
will allow them to make the decisions that will honor them as an adult.  They do not 
need to make life altering decisions that cannot be reversed before they can 
understand the consequences of their choices.  Please vote “ought not to pass” so that 
our children can remain children and not pawns of strangers who do not even care 
about them.
Sincerely,
Anita M Merritt
Paul A Merritt
