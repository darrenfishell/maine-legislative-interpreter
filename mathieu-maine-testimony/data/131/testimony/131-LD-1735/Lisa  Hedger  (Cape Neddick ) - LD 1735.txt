LD 1735
I do not support implementation of LD 1735. First of all, this is not providing 
healthcare to minors. Weâ€™re 50+ years into assuring women have reproductive rights 
and yet there are those actively supporting the destruction of the same in minors. This 
is abhorrent and the child should be provided with psychiatric/psychological care for 
an illness of the same. 
My additional opposition is the use of taxpayer funds to provide services especially to
those from another state. Mainers are already burdened with high taxes and the State 
should be focused on the needs of its citizens.
Thank you.
