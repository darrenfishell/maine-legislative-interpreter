Dear
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
I
am
writing
today
to
ask
you
to
support
LD
1735:
an
act
to
Safeguard
Gender -af firming
Health
Care.‚Äù
Recently ,
transgender
rights
have
been
under
attack
more
and
more
in
our
country .
Maine
must
continue
to
be
a
welcoming
place
for
all
people,
INCLUDING
trans
people.
It
must
not
become
a
state
of
exclusion
and
discrimination.
In
states
that
criminalize
transgender
medical
care,
the
receiver
of
the
medical
care
can
not
only
be
criminalized
but
also
the
parents
and
care
providers.
W e
must
not
be
a
state
that
continues
the
trend
of
discrimination
towards
people
accessing
gender -af firming
care,
for
this
care
is
a
right
that
provides
self-empowerment,
well-being,
and
non-discriminatory
support.
I
ur ge
you
to
support
this
bill
and
the
maintenance
of
Maine
as
a
place
of
welcomeness
and
kindness.
Thank
you.
