LD 1735
As a parent and  a concerned citizen for the well-being of our young people, LD 1735 
ought not to pass.
This proposed Bill is evil . Interventions to align a young person’s appearance or 
physical body with their gender identity  respects the gender identity of the patient, as 
experienced and defined by the patient is evil.  My child, our children , lack the  
maturity to decide as a patient to decide about having sex change surgery or 
interventions.  This is child mutilation advocacy and will lead to a great amount of 
problems and suicides in Maine. A child should not be allowed  to be taken across 
state lines to have sex change surgery or as stated: “interventions to suppress the 
development of endogenous secondary sex characteristics”. Those who would profit 
from this are the pharmaceutical and big medical entities . 
LD1735 would make Maine a trans-sanctuary state and invite human trafficking and 
abuses to prosper. This is evident in a quote statement : “A law enforcement agency 
may not knowingly make or participate in the arrest or extradition pursuant to an 
out-of-state arrest warrant for violation of another state's law against providing, 
receiving or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care”.
Another alarming quote: “It is the public policy of (Maine) that an out-of-state arrest 
warrant based on violating another state's law against providing, receiving or allowing
a child to receive gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care 
is the lowest law enforcement priority.”
LD 1735 would lead to physical health issues, physical mutilation and mental health 
troubles.  Trans trafficking of minors would make Maine a place of confusion for our 
kids and would invite child abuse regardless of where we live.  Parents and police 
would have no rights in this process. 
LD 1735 ought not to pass.
