LD 1735
Honorary Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
My name is Kristina Parker, I live in Sidney, Maine and I am seventeen years old. I 
am a conservative Christian. 
Where do we draw the line? Since the beginning of history, there has been male and 
female. There are very very simple ways that we are able to tell which is which. Why 
is it being questioned now? Furthermore, why are we trying to confuse children? The 
idea of male and female is amongst the most solid and logical ideas of humanity. If 
you pull the solid foundation of truth out from under an entire generationâ€™s feet, there 
will be no hope left for humanity. Passing a bill such as LD1735 will allow more and 
more absurdities to enter our country until everyone is confused and suicidal. Then 
where will we be? 
Do not pass LD1735 because it is extreme, ridiculous, bizarre, and dangerous. Woe to
anyone who supports or votes for this bill and let them not be re-elected because they 
are not doing their duty to the public.
