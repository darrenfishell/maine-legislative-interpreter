PubIIc Heanng for LD 1735 An Act to Safeguard Gender-affIrmIng Health Care (JudIcIary Comm|ttee) 
Testlmony submItted by Sara Bulkley (Cllnton, ME) 
Honorable Members ofthe JudIcIary CommIttee, my name Is Sara Bulkley and I am a resldent of ClInton 
Thank you for your servlce on th|s Commlttee PrIor to AprIl 3 of th|s year, I had never partlclpated In thIs 
process before but Its become clear that those runmng our state are not aware ofor IIstenIng to the volces 
of MaIners Th|s Is now the thIrd pubIIc hearmg I have attended In person, to ensure that changes On that 
note, I am here to speak In strong opposItIon to LD 1735
I 
ThIs bIll Is deeply troublIng Each tIme I read It, I am left wonderIng how the IndIvIduals who havejomed 
together to sponsor It could posslbly vIew th|s as a posItIve dIrectIon to move our state The nuclear famIly 
unIt forms the basls of a healthy soclety and parental rIghts are foundatlonal to maIntaInIng the IntegrIty 
of the famIIy Th|s bIll removes those parental rIghts when a mInor chIld Is struggllng wrth gender IdentIty 
Issues and Instead, grants them to the court system and anyone who claIms to be actIng In the best 
Interest of the chIld In addItIon, It completely tIes the hands of law enforcement to serve and protect 
vulnerable mmors, as Is theIr responsIbIlIty One must not be a rocket scIentIst to understand that thIs Is 
an Insane proposItIon and must not be allowed to become law here In our state 
Gender afﬁrmmg care Is known to be mental and physlcal health care that assumes a chIld's perceptlon 
of themselves IS accurate and the body IS then adapted chemIcally and/or surglcally to allevlate that 
”fee|Ing" of dlscomfort In theIr body I have found no Instances where th|s type of care Is substantlally 
geared towards helpIng a chIId become comfortable In theIr body as It exlsts But untIl a chIId reaches 
adulthood, It IS well understood by ratlonal people that theIr perceptlon and understandIng of theIr body 
and theIr braIn functlon and abIIIty to process Informatlon Is not mature For thIs reason, chIldren are not 
allowed to engage In many actIvItIes that we all agree are best reserved for adults Why would any 
responsIble, compasslonate adult suddenly thInk that It's a good Idea to provlde permanent treatment 
that results In sterIlIzatIon to chlldren who are stIll Immature and may be In a temporary struggle? The 
number of de-transItIonIng stones are growmg day by day and the devastatlon left In the wake of th|s 
antI-health care Is obvIous 
My questIon Is thIs why are members of thIs legIsIatIve body so eager to support what IS clearly chIld 
abuse? It IS a terrlble overstep and abuse of power and we all know It wIlI set a precedent for future battles 
where elected offIcIals and bureaucrats thmk they are somehow better qualIfIed to ralse other people's 
chIldren Do not go down th|s path I ask that you vote "Ought Not To Pass” on LD 1735 Thankyou
I
