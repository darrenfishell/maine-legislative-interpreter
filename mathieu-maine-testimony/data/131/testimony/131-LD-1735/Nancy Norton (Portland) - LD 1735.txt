LD 1735
To the Judiciary Committee, my name is Nancy Norton.
I am speaking in opposition to LD 1735.  
Our State does not need to be a sanctuary or a supporter of taking away a parents 
rights.  I am not transphobic.  I support each individuals right to express themselves 
when they are a ADULT.  Being an adult according to Maine laws starts at 18 for 
military service, voting, getting a tattoo and other freedoms.  According to our law 
you can not drink until 21 years.  Why then do we give a child the freedom to 
permanently change their bodies before they are considered an adult by other 
standards?  Why do we think a child knows better than their parents what is best for 
them?  This makes no sense.  This bill will wrongly represent many  Maine citizens 
beliefs of what it is to be a parent and family.  This is a wrong direction for our state.  
This is a waste of our time and tax payers dollars.  This bill will represent a very small
percentage of Maine citizens.   Thank you
