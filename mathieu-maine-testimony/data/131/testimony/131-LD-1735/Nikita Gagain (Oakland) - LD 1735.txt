Members of the Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, 
My name 1s N1k1ta Gagam, I am a resldent of Oakland, Mame, and I wrsh to add my name to the long 11st of 
supporters of LD 1735, An Act to Safeguard Gender-af ﬁrm1ng Health Care I unfortunately only found out 
about th1s heanng trme th1s mormng, so regretfully, I must apologrze that my po1nts are not as well developed 1n 
th1s message as I would prefer However, I st1l1w1sh to make my pos1t1on known, as I feel strongly that passlng 
th1s b1l1 1s an essentral protectron of hmnan r1ghts 
When I thmk of Mame, I thlnk of the phrase D1r1go, I lead I thrnk of how now, the natron needs Marne to lead 
the way 1n berng a safe haven I thmk 
it 1s absolutely lnhumane to cr1m1nal1ze accessmg and prov1d1ng access to gender afﬁrming healthcare, as some 
other states have done We know that such healthcare 1s frequently llfesavmg 
We should not be partrcrpatlng 1n the oppress1on of marglnahzed groups by condomng L11‘1_]1.1SlI, lnhumane, 
d1scr1m1natory laws That would not be acceptable LD 1735 protects access to l1fesav1ng healthcare for a h1gh- 
nsk marglnahzed demographrc 
I rmplore you to pass LD 1735 I wholeheartedly support th1s b111, and look forward to hearlng that you do, too 
Thank you for your t1me and publrc servlce,
