Good afternoon, chalrpersons Carney and Moonen, and all members of the JudIcIary,commIttee My 
name Is Jos|e PhIIlIps, and I am testIfyIng today as a res|dent of LewIston In favor of LD 1735 
My testImony today Is paInfuI for me I don’t IIke talkmg about my personal lIfe at work But I feel 
compelled to share a few thlngs about me today, In lnght of thIs bIII, and the bIIIs belng passed In state 
houses across the country 
The ﬁrst pIece of context about me Is that l’m transgender, In that I was born male and ralsed to bea 
man But despIte everyone ’s best efforts, well, It dIdn’t really stIck I started my transItIon whIIe 
attendnng college In Oklahoma and moved here from Oklahoma last year for my ]0b Oklahoma Is one 
of the many states pursulng a slate of antI-transgender IegIsIatIon that would make lIfe vIrtuaIIy 
Impossrble for people IIke me 
One Oklahoma bIII In partrcular stands out from the rest, HB 2177,‘ whIch passed through the state 
house of representatIves In February ThIs bIII would expIIcItIy ban best practlce, medlcally necessary 
gender affIrmIng care for mlnors, and would effectlvely prohIbIt thIs care for adults, too, by preventmg 
any care provIder receIvIng publlc fundIng from provIdIng gender afﬁrmlng care Any doctor who 
accepts MedIcaId patIents, for Instance, could be barred from treatmg transgender patIents, under thIs 
bIll 
If thIs bIII had been In effect when I was ﬁrst startlng my transItIon, I wouldn't be aIIve today That Isa 
deeply strange and uncomfortable thIng to say In a room full of strangers, but It’s the truth And It’s not 
just my truth, It’s the truth for many transgender people Before I began my transItIon, I was mIserable 
I had been experlenclng depressIon sInce chIldhood, and my dysphorIa —my sense of dlscomfort and 
dIsconnect from my body—was steadlly Increaslng wIth each passIng year DespIte many attempts to 
suppress or deny It, I reaIIzed that I needed to transItIon, and I was fully prepared to dIe If I couldn’t 
LuckIIy, I was able to receIve gender affIrmIng care through my unIversIty's clInIc I was ﬁnally able to 
feel comfortable In my own skIn and In my InteractIons wIth other people I was ﬁnally able to begIn 
buIIdIng a IIfe worth IIvIng for myself, and In doIng so, I have known joy that I never could have 
dreamed was possIble\ 
ThIs JOY, thIs Inner peace, Is what state legIsIatures across the country are trymg to strIp transgender 
people of ThIs Is what states are tryIng to crImInaIIze parents for provIdIng to theIr chlldren, and 
doctors for provIdIng to theIr patIents, despIte these bans belng opposed by an overvvheImIng majorlty 
of medlcal aSSOC|atlOTlS2 P0lItIcIans and actIvIsts In these states are attemptIng to deny transgender 
people our rIght to IIve They are attemptIng to InvestIgate our parents under fabrIcated claIms of chIld

abuse and removle children from loving homes 3 
They are calling us demons “ They are trying to brand 
us as pedophiles 5 
They are even, in some cases, outright calling for our elimination 6 These 
politicians are grotesquely capitalizing on their constituents ’ fear of what they do not understand for 
their own politicall gain,’ and in doing so, they are creating an atmosphere of terror for some of their 
states’ most vulné‘rable residents 
This political hostility bleeds into the social environment, as well Nationally, armed militias, including 
self-described Ch|l'lStl8l'I Fascists, ” have been disrupting Pride celebrations and other community 
events 9 There was a mass shooting in a queer club in Colorado 1° And in Tulsa, where I lived fora 
year, a donut shop that hosted a drag event was repeatedly vandalized, the second time by throwing 
a molotov cocktail through their front window 1‘
i 
All this makes mel feel unshakably afraid, for my future in this country and for the lives of my friends in 
states trying to crilminalize care My friends back in Oklahoma are scrambling to get out, in some 
cases leaving the‘only homes they've ever known They’re afraid of leaving, but they're even more 
afraid to stay

LD 1735 would e>%tend a lifeline to the people currently living under threat of these attempts at fear 
mongering and 8|lll'T'lll'\atlOl1 The bill would protect Maine doctors who provide gender afﬁrmmg care 
and make Maine a safe harbor to the parents of transgender children, parents who are just trying to 
provide their children the medical care they need to sun/ive LD 1735 would also send a message that 
in Maine, we don’t make life harder for our most vulnerable residents, and neither do we punish our 
medical professionals for providing high quality care to their patients Passing this bill would mean 
barely any dlff6l’e+C6 to the lives of most current Mainers, but it would mean everything to the people 
it protects Because of this, l implore you to pass LD 1735
