Hello,
I am a NH resident and oppose this bill because it will put NH families in danger.  
Parents have the right to oversee their children's healthcare, both medical and mental 
health.  This bill would allow gender-affirming care against the parents consent.  
Right now we are seeing a surge in detransitioning.  In so many cases permanent 
damage is done to the body resulting in disfigurement and sterility.
I ask you to oppose this bill.
Thank you.
