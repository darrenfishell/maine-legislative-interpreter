Doubts about the safety of "gender-affirming care" are coming from all corners of 
Europe, as well as from those in the United States who have been harmed by such 
treatment. The fact that there has been an explosion of "gender dysphoria" among 
teenage girls, a population whose susceptibility to social contagion is well 
documented, should give all authorities pause.
This bill has the potential to strip parents of their rights and duties to protect their 
children from these experimental practices. If this passes, the state of Maine could 
well be responsible for the destruction of the health of many young people and their 
families. If this bill passes, history will look upon Maine as we now look upon the 
eugenicists of the mid-20th century.
Children and families across the United States deserve better than this.
