To the members of the Judiciary Committee:
Do not support LD1735, support families and children instead.
Under the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (the UCCJEA), 
Maine is obligated to respect the child custody decisions made in other states just as 
other states are obligated to respect ours. The UCCJEA must not be ignored and risk 
our state being sued by loving parents who's children were taken from innocent 
parents.  Until and unless the parents are found to be abusivd in a court of law -- they 
remain innocent. No child deserves to be taken from parents who have not been ruled 
abusive by a court of proper jurisdiction.
Consider the mental and physical health of the minor child as if he or she were your 
own flesh and blood and DO NOT subject them to unnecessary medical procedures or
deem the custodial parents as abusive for wanting to keep their child healthy and 
whole. We all want ourselves to remain healthy as we raise our own children, keeping
children from loving parents harms the parents as well as the child.   A child cannot 
consent to being a ward of our state or taken from their loving parents. Many regret 
the alterations to their bodies -- mutilating one child is one too many. No child should 
be sentenced to be a patient for life jjust so they can express their personal style, 
wardrobes and hairstyles are not sex-specific.
Let children be loved, not mutilated.  
Sincerely, Kathy Johnson, Monson, Maine.
