LD 1735
My name is Tiffany Furbush and I live in Machias, Maine. I am writing in opposition 
of LD-1735. Not only does this bill represent a major overstep in the rights of parents 
with regard to their children, but it completely disregards the truth that individuals 
were created, by God, as a man or a woman and that is not to be changed. This bill, 
like many others, has taken the idea of a person's rights too far. You are protecting 
nothing, and destroying what God so perfectly and wisely created. Please vote "ought 
not to pass" on LD-1735. It is out of line.
