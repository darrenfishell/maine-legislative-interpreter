Tracy  Flewelling 
Northport 
LD 1735
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary:
My name is Tracy Flewelling and I live in Northport. Thank you for the opportunity 
to present this testimony and for your serving the State of Maine.
I stand opposed to LD1735 “An Act to Safeguard Gender Affirming Care”.
This legislation attempts to give power to the minority of Mainers who wish to 
promote the recent idea of gender fluidity across our state borders. It attempts to give 
them authority over the children of parents who reside in other states regardless of the
parents wishes or the laws of the state they reside in. It even forbids  our law 
enforcement to enforce out-of-state arrest warrants for violation of state laws.
It would be wise to stop spending Mainer’s tax dollars on legislation that is not about 
Maine or Maine residents, but will end up costing Maine residents more tax dollars.
As a voting member of the electorate who is opposed to irreversible surgeries and 
medications with long term harmful effects on unsuspecting children, as well as 
legislative interference with parental rights, I urge you to vote ought not to pass.
