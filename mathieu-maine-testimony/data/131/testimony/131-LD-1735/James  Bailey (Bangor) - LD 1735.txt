Dear
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee.
I
submit
this
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1735
-
An
Act
to
Safeguard
Gender -Af firming
Health
Care.
Maine
has
the
opportunity
to
become
a
safe
haven
for
citizens
that
have
had
their
existence
threatened
under
penalty
of
law
in
other
states
to
get
healthcare
that
is
recommended
and
approved
by
their
provider .
W e
can
continue
to
establish
Maine
as
a
welcoming
state
to
mar ginalized
people
and
value
their
safety
and
value
their
lives.
A
person
in
Maine
-
any
person
-
should
be
able
to
receive
healthcare
here
without
worrying
about
consequences
to
them
or
their
family
in
their
home
state
if
they
are
students
here,
vacationing,
or
traveling.
Maine
is
ranked
one
of
the
safest
states
in
the
country
and
we
should
continue
this
tradition
and
extend
it
to
every
person
that
resides,
schools,
vacations,
or
visits
our
state.
W e
must
not
let
a
small,
unwelcoming
fragment
of
our
population
whip
up
phantasms
of
fear
or
be
heralds
of
hate.
I
want
the
legislature
to
perpetuate
Maine’ s
reputation
as
a
leader ,
as
tolerant,
as
inclusive,
and
welcome
and
attract
those
who
may
face
the
oppressive
hand
of
bad
actors
utilizing
a
wave
of
exclusion
to
secure
and
wield
further
power .
Howard
Zinn
said
you
can’ t
stay
neutral
on
a
moving
train.
Some
states
are
loudly
proclaiming
their
exclusion,
their
threats
to
safety ,
and
their
hardness
in
their
hearts.
Maine
will
either
make
their
own
statement
of
welcoming,
safety ,
leadership,
and
inclusion
-
or
-
it’ s
silence
may
be
deafening
to
many
Mainers.
Thank
you,
James
Bailey
