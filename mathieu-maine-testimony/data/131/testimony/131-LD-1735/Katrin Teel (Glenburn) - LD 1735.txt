Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary:  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am here to testify in opposition of L.D. 1735, An Act to 
Safeguard Gender-affirming Health Care. 
 
After reading this bill, I am stunned that Maine would have the audacity to consider usurping the 
authority and jurisdiction of another state in our Union.  
 
For instance, I understand that if a doctor from a different state violates laws regarding sex 
change operations and then flees to Maine, Maine will refuse to cooperate with the 
investigation. Or if someone removes a child from their parentâ€™s custody so that the child will 
undergo such an operation, Maine courts will not intervene.  
 
What kind of arrogance is this? We do not have the right to tell other states how to conduct their 
business, just like we would not appreciate them conducting ours. This bill is an embarrassment 
to the state of Maine. 
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Ought Not to Pass on L.D.1735. Thank you for 
allowing me to contribute my testimony.
