LWVME Youth Council
LD 1735

RE:An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Health Care 
Good Afternoon, 
My name is Frankie Roberts.  I’m a resident of Unity. I am here today as a member of
LWVME’s Youth Council. This program helps young people to explore how Maine’s
government works and build their civic leadership skills. This testimony does not 
represent LWVME’s view only those of the Youth Council. I am testifying in support 
of LD 1735.
The Trevor Project recently uploaded the results of their 2022 National Survey on 
LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. This survey consisted of results from nearly 34,000 
LGBTQ youth aged 13 to 24 across the United States, with 48% being transgender or 
non-binary. There were various notable and worrying statistics throughout this survey
that mainly focused on transgender or non-binary youth. For example, fewer than 1 in
3 transgender and nonbinary youth find their homes to be gender affirming, 45% of 
LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide within the past year– which includes more
than half of transgender and nonbinary youth, and 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted 
suicide in the past year– including nearly 1 in 5 transgender of nonbinary youth. The 
rate of considered and attempted suicide was most prevelant in transgender boys/men 
and nonbinary/genderqueer individuals. 
This survey included a section specifically for anti-trans legislation. 93% of 
transgender and nonbinary youth reported that they have worried about transgender 
people being denied access to gender-affirming medical care due to state or local 
laws. As a nonbinary youth born and raised in Maine, I have always felt grateful for 
our state’s unwavering support for individuals like myself. I’ve rarely had to worry 
about my future and whether or not I will have access to gender affirming healthcare I
may seek– however, recently I have been worried about kids like me in other states 
that are being denied these basic rights and face detrimental effects on their mental 
health because of it. 
LD 1735 further guarantees the right to gender-affirming health care for the youth of 
Maine, and it also provides assistance to out of state kids seeking this same care that 
is necessary to their well being as individuals. Maine is known as a welcoming and 
accepting state for not only its own residences, but also for any outside visitors. I’m 
asking you to continue to support and protect individuals like myself, therefore I’m 
asking you to vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 1735. 
Thank you for your time,
Frankie Roberts
