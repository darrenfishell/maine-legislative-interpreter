I live in a NH city that borders Maine (Rochester). My entire life has been one of 
crossing into Maine for shopping,hiking,camping and religious experiences. I oppose 
this bill!
To even think of my loved one being being given the LIFE ALTERING services you 
are proposing in this legislation makes me absolutely sick!!! You are crossing into an 
area that will have GRAVE consequences for the State of Maine!!! 
If any person in Maine were to provide life altering medical procedures on my loved 
one, I vow to hold you personally responsible! This is NOT NECESSARY and would
leave children and their families in a health crisis!!! 
Mothers and fathers are responsible for raising their children!!! If a child opposes 
decisions their parents make, they can move out once they're legally an adult & are 
responsible for their own financial decisions!!! There are laws that protect children 
from abuse. This bill in itself is criminal!!!
You have crossed the line with this legislation!!! Legally and ethically!! This will 
destroy the State of Maine, economically!!
