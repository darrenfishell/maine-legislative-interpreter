I do not believe that it is the government's business to interfere in the matters of a 
family. The act of harboring a child without the consent or knowledge of a parent is 
KIDNAPPING. If this were to happen to your child how would you feel. Children are
the responsibility of the parents. I believe that is even a law, until they are out of high 
school or otherwise emancipated. Children can not buy alcohol, buy cigarettes or vote
so how do you condone allowing them to come to this state and ruin their lives. This 
is not what you were elected for!
