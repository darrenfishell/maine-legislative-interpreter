Good Afternoon, my name is Alicia Lawson l'rn a mother of 5 and a Winthrop resident here to testify 
is strong opposition to the bill LD-1735 
t will not sugar coat what it was like to raise a ciuestionsng child with autism spectrum disorder It was 
hell at times for all of us her four younger siblings, my husband, rnyselt, our marriage 
There were times where my husband and I took shifts doing suicide watch outside her bedroom door 
which lead to a crisis stay at the height of the Covid pandemic 
Even when my daughter's pediatrioiaii pushed to have us sign a reterral to the gender clinic, I clung to 
the hope l found in her l()Sy’Cl’ll&’[TlS‘3t’S words, children with A56 see gender as less black and white, 
but almost always grow out of it.“ 
I knew in my heart that if we could just get her over this hump, she would be okay And I'm here to tell 
you, I was right 
Puberty is hard Body changes are uncomfortable I remember feeling self conscious about my own 
growing breasts as a kid. It was humiliating at times, especially around boys But these changes are 
normal and necessary Unfortunately ihese normal changes have become pathologized into 
“something is wrong with you” 
I stand here to tell you, with my education and experience with working at an inpatient psychiatric 
hospital with children, adolescents, and young adults, what kids need today IS consistency, stability, 
attention, love and someone to protect theml 
Gender affirmation care does none of that 
My intelligent, once questioning, thoughtful 18 year old daughter Just completed her first year of 
college at the University of Maine iii Orono, studying climate sciences, and made the Dean's List all 
semesters She is a thriving, beautiful, intact female and I couldn't be more proud of how much she 
has overcome 
She didn't need gender affirming care She needed steady and strong parents to protect her 
In a text message I'll never forget, my daughter wrote, “I think you were nght, by the way, I'm not 
transgender, I'm a woman" 
I gave my daughter the gift of time Children need to be kids, let them be kids Do not allow bills, that 
support the medical mutilation of children, to pass If this passes, parents like me, who choose to 
wait, who choose to protect, could lose our rights to be the authority over our children Do not pass 
this l_D—1735 It is not good for families It is not good for kids It is not good for Maine
