LD 1735
I’m contacting you in opposition to LD 1735, An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming 
Health Care. 
This bill prohibits the enforcement of an order based on another state's law 
authorizing a child to be removed from the child's parent or guardian based on that 
parent or guardian allowing the child to receive gender-alteration. It is not the place of
Maine to interfere with another state’s law or to interfere in the relationship between 
parent and child. This bill prohibits a lot of other things that are none of your business
or concern, and in essence would make Maine a gender-alteration sanctuary state for 
minor children. You need to respect the rights of parents and leave our children alone.
I urge this committee to vote “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1735.
