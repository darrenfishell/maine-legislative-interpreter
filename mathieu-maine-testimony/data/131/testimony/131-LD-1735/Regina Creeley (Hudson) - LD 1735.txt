Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and d1st1ngu1shed members of the Jud1c1ary 
Commlttee 
My name 1s Reglna Creeley and I am testrfymg 1n oppos1t1on to L D 1375 My resldence 1s 1n Hudson 
and I’m a retlred mlddle school speclal educatron teacher In 2014, I was voted Specral Educatlon 
Professronal of the year (by the Mame Admmrstrators of Servrces for Chlldren w1th D1sab111t1es 
(MADSEC)) 
I l1ke to th1nk that th1s b1ll was crafted Wl[l'l the best of rntentrons but as all adults know the best of 
1ntent1ons often lead to unrntentronal paln It seems obvrous to me that thrs b1ll can be used as a tool by 
sexual predators There are all krnds of sexual predators When I was a teenager, I volunteered ata 
foster home There was a dehghtful three year old glrl there who got raped and almost dled I spent 
hours rocklng her and soothlng her when she woke from her nlghtmares I thought of that sexual 
predator and how he had ga1ned some sort of sat1sfact1on as he almost kllled the small chrld 
I have worked wrth chtldren my whole hfe and run rnto a number of sexual predators and reported any 
that threatened my students when I could recognlze them as such There are so many kmds I have 
met two that get sexually t1t1llated when chlldren cross dress They thought about that and planned for 
1t I taught mrddle school for thnty years and I knew people who llked to hsten to the chlldren talk 
about the1r new found sexuahty Some predators are rather obv1ous and others are undetectable and 
have very clean background checks that help them get professlonal ]0l)S worktng w1th chrldren 
It seems obvlous to me that some predators w11l gam the conﬁdence of adolescents and ask them how 
they are feelrng about thelr gender They could ask 1f Suzy or Jlmmy are st1llth1nk1ng about changlng 
the1r gender Are therr parents st11l refusmg to let them get gender changmg treatments ’? Are they k1nd 
of angry at the1r parents? Well, the predator w1ll let them know they can help by saylng, “I can dnve 
you to a place where you can get gender changlng treatments and your mom and dad can’t stop us In 
Ma1ne, they passed a law that says chrldren can get treatments and parents can’t stop them So how 
about you get 1n my car and we’ll dr1ve to Mame I’ll get us a hotel room and I’ll drlve you around to 
your appomtments” 
Any sane person can see that there are so many thlngs wrong wrth that scenarlo 
The vast ma]or1ty of parents protect the1r chrldren and want what 1s best for them Chrldren go through 
so many phases These phases can change 1n a flash and other tlmes last for years The parents l1ve 
through these phases w1th the1r chtldren Governmental laws should not spht chrldren from thelr mam 
protectors Parents are better protectors than overloaded Cl'11l(l servrce provlders There 1s no presslng 
need for th1s b1ll There 1s danger that 1t w1ll cause much harm and be used as a tool by shck sexual 
predators Vote ought not to pass
