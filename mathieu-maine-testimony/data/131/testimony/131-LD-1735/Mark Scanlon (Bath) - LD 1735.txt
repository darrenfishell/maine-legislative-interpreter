LD 1735
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
This is the first letter I have written regarding pending legislation.  I regret not 
writing a letter for LD 1619 (legislation that will increase the number of children 
being killed in the womb), so I’m writing with regard to LD 1735 (legislation that will
mutilate children outside of the womb).
How did we get here?  When did our Lawmakers lose the instinct to protect children
and, instead, propose legislation to kill or maim children?  I think every state has 
“statutory rape” laws.  These laws say that an adult cannot have sex with a child under
the age of 16 even if the child is completely willing.  The reasoning behind these laws
is that a child under 16 cannot consent to sex.  At that age, the child cannot 
understand all the implications of that decision.  This reasoning is sound.  Do you 
honestly believe a child understands the irreversible implications of puberty blockers, 
cross-sex hormones, and surgery?  To put this into perspective, a person under 18 is 
not allowed to have a body piercing without their parent’s consent.  LD 1735 ignores 
all protective logic and removes all safeguards for children to irreversibly mutilate 
themselves either by surgery or hormones.  Furthermore, it robs the parents (who 
completely understand all the implications of the decision) of any and all power to 
parent. 
Self-reporting in psychology is not reliable.  It is even less reliable for confused 
children who feel uncomfortable about their body.  But “Gender-Affirming” care 
forbids psychologists from questioning the child’s decision.  You must allow parents 
to be the voice of reason before their children head down this irreversible path.  
Please vote “NO” on LD 1735.  Children have always needed our protection and 
they need it even more in this confusing world we currently live in.
