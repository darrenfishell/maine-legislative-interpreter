Dear
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee.
I
am
here
to
advocate
for
LD
1735
to
be
further
workshopped
and
moved
to
the
next
legislative
session.
While
there
are
parts
of
it
that
need
work,
I
strongly
believe
in
the
importance
of
gender -af firming
care.
My
name
is
Sam
and
I
grew
up
in
Maine
and
I
am
proud
to
call
this
place
my
home.
I
am
transgender
and
I
use
she/her
pronouns.
T o
me,
what
makes
Maine
so
beautiful
is
the
strong
sense
of
the
transgender
community .
Having
experiences
of
gender -based
oppression,
safety
and
a
sense
of
togetherness
is
crucial.
Last
month,
I
or ganized
a
transgender
and
non-binary
celebration.
Over
70
people
came
to
celebrate
trans
joy ,
many
of
them
identifying
as
part
of
the
community .
This
was
just
for
people
in
Orono.
Attending
UMaine,
many
of
my
out-of-state
transgender
friends
rely
on
gender -af firming
care
in
Maine.
As
a
transgender
woman,
I
understand
the
need
for
this
care.
Growing
up
in
the
wrong
gender ,
I
became
suicidal.
Feeling
safe
and
confident
in
my
womanhood
has
saved
my
life.
Similarly ,
for
my
trans-out-of-state
friends,
the
care
they
receive
here
is
life-saving.
While
recognizing
applicable
parental
concerns,
it
is
crucial
to
see
how
gender -af firming
care
saves
lives.
That
is
why
this
bill
needs
further
revising.
W e
must
place
importance
on
my
communityâ€™ s
need
for
af firming
health
care.
Thank
you
for
your
strong
consideration
in
moving
LD
1735
to
the
next
legislative
session
for
further
workshopping.
