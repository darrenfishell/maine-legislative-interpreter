Testimony of Representative Laurie Osher presenting 
LD 1735, An Act to Safeguard Gender-af ﬁrming Health Care 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and esteemed colleagues of the J ud1c1ary Cormmttee, I am 
Laune Osher and I represent D1str1ct 25, the ma] onty of Orono Thank you for the opportumty to 
present LD 1735, An Act to Safeguard Gender-af ﬁrming Health Care, lmown as the “Sh1eld B111” 
At 1ts heart, LD 1735 1s about protectlng the wellbelng and medlcal pnvacy of young people and then 
fam1l1es Rlght now, wh1le other states are actlvely crlmlnallzmg safe, medlcally necessary health care, 
the stakes are h1 gher than ever 
Gender-af ﬁrmmg health care saves 11ves Research shows that access to gender-af ﬁrmmg care greatly 
lmproves mental health outcomes for transgender youth,‘ lowermg rates of depress1on, anxlety, gendel 
dysphorla, self-harm and su1c1dal1ty and unprovmg measures of res1l1ence and well-bemg2 
The research 1s so clear that every II121_]0I' medlcal orgamzatlon - lncludlng the Amencan Academy of 
Pedlatucs, the Amencan Medlcal Assoclatlon and the Amencan Psychlatrlc Assoc1at1on, among many 
others3 - supports prov1d1ng age-appropnate gender-af ﬁrmlng care for transgender and nonblnary 
young people Our medlcal professlonals know that access to gender-af ﬁrmmg care 1s essent1a1 for 
those who need 1t, and they also know that there are strong, evldence-based standards of care4 
Desplte the medlcal consensus, there IS a coordlnated natlonal attack on gender-af ﬁrmmg care,5 tummg

Testlmony of Rep. Laurie Osher, PhD, presenting LD 1735

17 2 A» llve 1n statel 
s that are conslderlng pol1c1es to restnct or ban gender-a ﬂflrmtng care 6 For the 
fam1l1es affected, these pol1c1es are hannful and cruel 
At least twelve states have already 1esponded by enactmg legal protectlons for those who prov1de th1s 
lmportant care and for those who seek 1t 7 Just th1s week 1n Vermont, Republlcan Governor Phll Scott 
stgned add1t1onalprotect1ons 1nto law8O 
In a statement on sigmng that b1ll, Governor Scott sa1d that the people of Vermont stand for prlvacy, 
personal autonomy and that med1cal prov1ders should be free to practlce W1thout fear 9 
I beheve that’s 
true of Malners, too 
er 
tlh LD 1735 seeks to potect Ma1ne’s medlcal p1ofess1onals who prov1de gender-af ﬁrmmg care and the 
people they treat h e 1n our state Our goal 1s to make 1t clear that Mame law sh1elds them from 
prosecutton by other states, protects the1r pnvacy and personal lnformatlon, and preserves access to 
th1s cr1t1cally lmportant medlcal care for adults and youth al1ke 
We are work1ng w1th stakeholders and the Ofﬁce of the Attorney General to ﬁnallze amendment 
language, and I respectfully request the comm1ttee conslder carrylng th1s measure over to allow
I 
sufﬁclent tlme for at work 
For transgender anri l non-b1nary young people, the most lmportant thmg the adults 1n thelr l1ves can do 
1s to be supportlve They are lookmg to us - leaders 1n thetr communltles and 1n thelr state - to 
understand whether they are valued, accepted and safe Here 1s what I would l1ke to say dlrectly to 
those young people You matter You are valued for the person you truly are - your authent1c self We 
W111 ﬁght for you, to keep you safe and to make sure you have the care and support you need to thnve 
To members of the pommlttee Mame has a long trad1t1on of promot1ng equal1ty and 1nclus1on, and we 
contmue to be a nat| 1onal leader when 1t comes to enactmg pol1c1es that protect and afﬁrm our 
LGBTQ+ communittes Mame voters and the rep1 esentatwes they elect have repeatedly chosen 
equal1ty m mamagie, wlth protectlons from d1scr1m1nat1on and vlolence, and 1n gender equahty I am 
so proud of th1s tradttton, wlnch 1s one of the many reasons I am so grateful to call th1s place my home 
Now 1s the tune to choose equahty and 1nclus1on once aga1n by enact1ng the cruc1al protectlons we are 
proposmg 
Thank you for your conslderatton I am happy to answer any questlons you may have for me
