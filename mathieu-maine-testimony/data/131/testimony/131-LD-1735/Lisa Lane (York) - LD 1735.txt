This is absurd! This sounds like human trafficking cleverly disguised as 
compassionate care for children! Who will accompany these kids over state borders? 
Who will accompany these children when they attend a medical appointment? Who 
will counsel them as a procedure ensues? What if a child changes their mind at the 
last minute? Who will they turn to? As I said..this is absurd and abusive and 
exploitative. CHILDREN CANNOT CONSENT
