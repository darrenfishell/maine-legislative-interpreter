Pete Harring
Washington
LD 1735
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Pete Harring and I am a resident of 
Washington. I am presenting my written testimony in opposition to LD 1735. 
Having been a child myself, I was not sure who I was, or what I really wanted 
probably a thousand times. Allowing gender reassignment surgery and puberty 
blocking drugs for minors is simply wrong. I see no problems with waiting until they 
reach adulthood. After such time people can do whatever they wish to their own body.
I ask that all of you do the moral and just thing and vote “OUGHT NOT TO PASS”. 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, Pete Harring
Have a Blessed day.
