As a mother of 3 children in New Hampshire I am adamantly opposed to this 
Legislation as my minor child is MINE...and NOT  a child of ANY government or 
state who has no business interfering with my parenting without my knowledge or 
consent. 
Should the state of Maine take custody of MY minor child for ANY reason 
whatsoever the lawsuit you will expose yourselves to will be quick, harsh and 
immense at all levels!! 
Thank you for opposing this egregiously Marxist Bill !!!
