Testimony 
In Opposition to 
LD 1735 “An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Healthcare ” 
Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee My 
name is Katrina Smith and l represent District 62, China, Palermo, Somerville, Windsor and Hibberts Gorel 
am here today to speak against LD 1735 “An Act to Safeguard Gender-affirming Healthcare" 
LD 1735 lS a dangerous and radical bill aimed to steal the future away from children It IS an assault on 
parental rights, a beckoning call for runaways, a push for unlimited opportunities for trafficking and gives 
blanket approval to the mutilation of children under the guise of gender affirmation 
LD 1735 allows the state of Maine to receive children from other states who want to obtain dangerous and 
harmful transgender treatments without the consent of both parents or even without the consent of any 
parent If a child arrives in Maine with the purpose of receiving mental or physical gender treatments 
without a parent that child can become a ward of the state and treatment Wlll be paid for by Maine 
taxpayers Free access to gender treatment lS directly advertising Maine as a haven for traffickers and 
runaways who are experiencing dysphoria, trauma and confusion I notice the fiscal note only mentions 
possible civil suits against the state, a huge concern in itself, but don't you think that advertising free 
surgery to people throughout the country Wlll bring insane financial consequences to the Maine taxpayer ’ 
This bill not only overrides parental consent it clearly states that if one parent brings a child to Maine to 
receive treatment and the other parent does NOT want their child to receive treatments Maine will 
automatically side with the parent who believes in so called “gender affirming care" Why would we assert 
the state of Maine in the middle of a family discussion ’ Why would we side and give haven to one parent 
when we know nothing about the intentions of either parent A State cannot love a child Only a parent 
can love a child 
The bill never defines the word child, and it presents life-altering treatments as the definitive and only cure 
for struggling youth If you are a parent at what age did you decide you wanted children ’ Even in your 
mid-twenties did you know you wanted to have kids yet’ This bill will take the fertility from countless 
children who haven't even had the adult thought of what their future family Wlll look like Castration, 
vaginoplasty and mastectomies not only remove the possibility of bearing children they completely take
sexual pleasure away for the rest of a person's life when they haven't even experienced what it is Whata 
horrible mistake 
Countless people are now seeking a way to restore their physical and mental health by de-transitioning, 
reversing their medical transitions There are now a myriad of stories being told how surgery to remove 
penises and breasts, puberty blockers and hormone therapy did not fix the trauma or pain inside of the 
person who received the aforementioned procedures Sadly, de-transitioning will never give them back 
fertility, pleasure or wholeness and that is a tragedy we should not be expediting for children Ina 
Swedish study it was found that adults who transitioned were 19 times more likely to kill themselves after 
transitioning and for females it was 40 times‘ 
Finland, Sweden and England have now turned back decades of transitioning services they previously 
allowed making it required that a child have mental health treatment before any hormones or treatment 
can commence France, Australia and Norway have banned or limited gender transitions in children 
Maine will be on the vwong side of history if we allow this bill to pass and we will most certainly be 
complicit in the mutilation, death and destruction of countless children and families I beg you to love 
children and support them, but don't allow this mutilation, this destruction of innocent bodies to prevail 
on our shores 
Thank you
