Lisa Dudley
Marshfield 
LD 1735
Senator Carney and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Lisa Dudley, I 
am a resident of Marshfield. 
I urge you to VOTE ought not to pass on LD 1735.
Between the ages of 15-17 I was introduced to bisexual and lesbian relationships. 
After a terrible break-up with a boyfriend of 2 years, I turned to same-sex 
relationships for over a year. When I found just as much confusion in all that goes on 
within a relationship I returned to choosing to pursue heterosexual relationship. 
Had all the pressure to think I was different or should be different, along with the 
medical procedures being encouraged and offered were available to me in those short 
12 or so months- I fear I would have made drastic decisions that I would have 
regretted. I do not think you realize what you are opening up with these choices.
Please protect our vulnerable youth as they are just trying to navigate their constantly 
changing bodies and all the emotions that go along with it.
We give them boundaries for cigarettes, drivers licenses, alcohol, voting..why is this 
severe body change not held at a much more important level of protection?
Please help us to protect our youth with a voice of reason- we all had to wait for many
things until "we were old enough" and we are not any worse off for the waiting.
Vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD1735
Thank you for your time.
