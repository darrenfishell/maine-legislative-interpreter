Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee:  
LD 477, Resolve, Directing the Department of Education, Maine School Safety Center to Convene a 
Stakeholder Group to Develop Best Practices for Lockdown Dril ls and Allowing Parents to Opt Out 
of Lockdown Drills for Their Children , directs the Maine Department of Education to convene a 
workgroup  to study lockdown drills implemented by school administrative units (SAUs)  to develop a 
compilation of best practices that minimize the traumatic impact these drills may have on students 
and staff. The workgroup will deliver a report to the Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature  
and the D epartment jointly with the Sta te Board of Education  will adopt rules amending C hapter  125:  
Basic Approval Standards: Public Schools and School Adminis trative Units , to allow parents to opt 
out of lockdown drills for their child.  
Title 20 -A, §1001(16) outlines the responsibility  for SAUs  to have a comprehensive health and safety 
emergency management plan. Rule Chapter 125 outlines the expectations for the numbers of 
evacuation and safety drills, however the specifics of those plans are local decisions.  Lock down 
drills should be part of a larger school safety plan and  are important for emergency preparation 
beyond active shooter or  high threat scenarios.  Currently , neither statute nor rules outline common 
standards or best practices for these drills.    
It will be important to have appro priate experts and stakeholders as part of the workgroup. In 
addition to representatives  from the Maine School Safety Center  and the Office of Special Services 
and Inclusive Education , the Department recommends the following  public safety professional  
groups be included:  Maine School Resource Officer Association, Maine State Police, Maine Sheriffs 
Association, Department of Public Safety, State E mergency Management Services Director, State 
Fire Marshalls, and the Maine Criminal Justice Academy.   
Conve ning a workgroup  and producing a report  requires dedicated staff time.  The Department 
recommends a fiscal note of $5,00 0.   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 477 and respond to  any 
questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Jonathan Shapiro  
Director, Maine School Safety Center
