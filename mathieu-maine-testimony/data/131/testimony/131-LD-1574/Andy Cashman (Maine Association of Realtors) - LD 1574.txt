Testimony in Opposition of LD 1574 (“An Act to Create Rent Stabilization and 
Amend the Laws Regarding Termination of Tenancy and Rent Increase Limitations ”) 
J. Andrew Cashman on behalf of the Maine Association of REALTORS® 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name IS Andy Cashman I am the Founder of Resolve 
Government Relations and we represent the Maine Association of REALTORS®, a 
professional trade association established in 1936 with over 6,500 members statewide 
REALTORS® grow Maine's economy and build Maine communities Our members 
represent buyers and sellers involved in both residential and commercial real estate 
transactions Our membership also includes industry affiliates, such as lenders, closing 
agents, title agents, appraisers, building inspectors, sun/eyors, etc The Maine 
Association is chartered by the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR), the largest 
trade association in the country 
The Maine Association of REALTORS® strongly opposes LD 1574 The bill would limit 
the property owner’s ability to terminate a tenancy at will with a 30-day notice, and it 
would extend the period to 90 days if the property owner compensates the tenant If the 
housing provider is leasing a dwelling that is 4-units or less, they are exempt This bill 
would also limit rental increases to once annually and limit percentages at which rent 
could increase All of these provisions violate the constitutional right of every individual 
to acquire, occupy, use and dispose of real properly 
In tenancy at will situations, neither the property owner nor the tenant has committed to 
the other forthe long term This provides both with flexibility and both parties understand 
that the agreement can end at any time Current law provides sufficient protections and 
an appropriate balance for both parties that should not be expanded upon 
Property owners who lease their units are operating Maine businesses They provide 
safe and decent housing and tenants pay a monthly rent that covers the cost of providing 
this housing This bill would place an additional burden on property owners who have 
chosen to enter their property into the rental market By tripling the notice period for some 
housing providers, it may make the market unfavorable for prospective property owners 
to want to enter the rental market or continue renting their property and could remove 
units from the rental stock Rental housing needs are best met through private investment 
and incentives to accomplish the development of rental housing, not additional 
regulations This bill would negatively impact the ability of the private sector to meet the 
needs and demands for rental property efficiently and effectively by making the market

W|th respect to the rent control pl'OVlSl0l'1S ln the blll, we understand that a rent 
mcrease can put an unexpected and conslderable straln on household ﬁnances, but 
that stram occurs for all, not just tenants A property owner needs to be able to at 
least match expenses (property carrylng costs and admmlstratlon) m order for the 
market to st|ll remaln deslrable Although the current housmg market can make 
f|nd|ng new housmg a challenge, markets w|ll change and permanent statutory 
changes In response to temporary cond|t|ons IS mappropnate 
For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1574 
Thank you for your tlme and conslderatlon
