To The D1st1ngu1shed Members of the Jud1c1ary Commlttee 
From Damel J Bermer, represent1ng the 
Central Ma1ne Apartment Owners Assoc1at1on work1ng 1n con]unct1on wrth the Rental 
Hous1ng Alhance of Southem Mame, the Greater Bangor Area Owners’ and Managers ’ 
Assocratlon, the Cap1tal Area Hous1ng Assoc1at1on, and Lewrston Auburn Landlord 
Assoc1at1on 
Re LD J 5 74 An Act to Create Rent Stabzlzzatzon and Amend the Laws Regardzng 
T ermznatzon of a Tenancy and Rent Increase Lzmztatzon 
I am wr1t1ng 1n oppos1t1on to th1s b1ll 
I W111 ﬁrst address Sectlon 3 Th1s sectron leads to more rent mcreases Landlords 
h1stor1cally have tended to go several years w1thout1ncreas1ng rent You may wart ﬁve (5) 
years and not 1ncrease rent and then mcrease rent twenty (20%) percent after ﬁve (5) years 
Under th1s 1f a landlord m1sses a smgle year of rent 1ncrease, they cannot make 1t up So, most 
leases under th1s statute would probably be redrafted to say that rent 1ncreases every year by 
seven (7%) percent plus the consumer pr1ce mdex In fact, 1n my leases I would probably 
spec1ﬁcally cross reference the statute saylng rent W111 be mcreased each year 1n accordance 
w1th 14 M R S A §6016 sub sectlon 2 that way the landlord 1s covered for follow1ng the law 
Th1s prov1s1on would be very counter product1ve for tenants 
In referencmg CPI, I trred to ﬁgure out what 1s 1ncluded 1n CPI, but 1t appears 1t 1s heav1ly 
geared towards food and factors that do not pertam to housmg Rent 1s generally rncreased 
based on 011 pnces, the cost of buymg housmg, bu1ld1ng mater1als because landlords are always 
mak1ng lmprovements and 1nterest rates 1f you have a var1ab1e rate loan CPI 1s not necessanly 
gomg to reﬂect those factors properly Usmg an 1ncorrectly mdex could work agarnst tenants or 
could work agamst landlords If food pnces went up drast1cally, but o1l and bu1ld1ng matenals 
rema1n stable th1s measure would l1kely lead to blgger rent mcreases It also appears we would 
be usmg a natronal measure and I do want to confess I a1n trymg to educate myself on exactly 
what CPI 1s composed of, but do to a short hear1ng not1ce I have not had t1me to get myselfa 
thoroughly educated as I could 
On the sect1on on Termination of a Tenancy, th1s would make tenants less safe 
and condemn landlords to be1ng harassed by tenants Essentrally 1t would do away w1th no

cause evrctrons unless you grve a nrnety (90) day notrce and pay the tenants one month’s rent 
The landlord I represented last summer who was berng harassed over then Hrspamc back 
ground would have to put up wrth 1t or pay the tenant one month rent and grve a 90 day notrce 
The landlord I represented a few years ago who was berng harassed over therr sexual preference 
would face the same drlemma If the tenant 1s threatemng other tenants 1n the bu1ld1ng, but the 
other tenants are afrard to testrfy so the landlord cannot prove cause, they would have to grve 
the tenant who 1s threatemng the other tenants a nmety (90) day notrce and pay them one 
month’s rent When you pay people to engage 1n bad behavror, you get more bad behavror 
On Sectron l of the b1ll, I am really not entrrely sure what 1t does and we may want to 
check 1s that _]llSl; gomg to apply to resrdentral verses commerc1al leases Generally a one (1) 
year lease w1ll say at the end of the year 1t goes month to month unless they srgn a new 
agreement There are some wntten leases that w1ll say at the end of the year they automatrcally 
renew for another year Those leases are really not 1n the best 1nterest of erther the landlord or 
the tenant and sometrmes landlords get them onlrne and not rea11z1ng 1t 1s not a very good lease 
I st1ll do not know thrs 1s a questron you want to address 1n statute If thrs were to apply to 
commercral leases rt could be a serrous problem, because commercral leases do usually renew 
for a longer perrod of trme Occasronally there are leases partrcularly on a bu1ld1ng where one 
person owns the bu1ld1ng a.nd one person owns the land and you would want the ab1l1ty to have 
leases to renew longer so I do not know 1f you want to totally forego the ab1l1ty to have leases 
that go year after year 
Thank you for your tlme and CO11S1d6I'8I1OI1 
Very truly yours,
