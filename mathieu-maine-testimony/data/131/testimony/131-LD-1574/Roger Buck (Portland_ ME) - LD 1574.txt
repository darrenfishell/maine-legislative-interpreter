I am Roger Buck from Portland, Maine. I am opposed to this bill. It will require a 
housing provider to pay a tenant one month's rent to terminate a tenancy, even with 90
days notice. It will make it very difficult for a provider to remove a problem tenant, to
the detriment of other, well behaved tenants. It imposes rent control, which has been 
shown in economic studies to reduce the quality and quantity of rental housing.
