Dear Committee:  
RE: LD1574  
I am w riting in op position to this bil l. 
Sec 1.5 – allowing this bill to pass  would encourage ba d behav ior in tenants  by allowing 3 lease viola tions 
before allowing termi nation of the lease.  Rewarding bad behavior is not a good solution.  
Sec 2.2 – are you wanting land lords to pay for a tenant to leave? Th at seems to be unfair and  will on ly 
increase re nts and vacancies . What happen s if the landlo rd wants to sell and needs to have a vacant unit. 
90 days is a long ti me to give someone which I am fine with . It’s the  paying them to leave that is not 
right. If the landlord want s to do renovations and a unit has to be vacated then what? It  is full of holes 
and making enemies out of the l andlord. I a ssume that is not the intent of this proposed bill.  
In regards to rent increase  regulations : 
Will the gover nment subsidize when heating and elect ric costs spike like they have over the pas t 2 years ? 
Utilities and maintenance costs have increase 15 -20% and more . As a landlord, I have had to  increase 
rents just to cover the costs. This will prevent landlords from making i mprovements to b uildings  as well.  
Will you tell Walmart or Hannaford that their food price inc reases are  only allow able to a certain 
percentage ? Will you limit  the amount of incre ases in interest rates, insurance rates, repair costs on 
these lar ge cor porations? Heating oil and propane costs? CMP increases? Labor costs?  All th ese costs  are 
part of why rents have had to increase . 
Again, this bill should be not conside red for passing.  
Thank you,
