"I vote no on LD1574
 Providing housing is becoming very expensive because the cost of buildings, labor 
and materials have gone up substantially.
-This will stop development in our state and prevent additional units from coming 
online.
-Rent control will force housing providers to take the maximum rent increase each 
year, while many of us don't increase the rent on our tenants. 
-We need 30 day notices to get problematic tenants out when they are causing issues 
to the building and neighbors.
