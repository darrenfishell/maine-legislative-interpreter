LD 1574
 I am opposed to LD 1574.
The passage of this bill would ironically result in less housing stock as many investors
and or landlords would reduce rental work in this state.
I work full time at least 40 hours a week 7 days a week fixing up rundown houses/ 
units. Per hour my income is equivalent to minimum wage.
I understand the plight of those needing afforable housing as I was in that boat sort of 
speak for many years as a single mother.
However, at the same it is unethical to bring the income of landlords down. There are 
many landlords who like myself, depend on their earnings to make ends meet. They 
are not like the steriotypical millionaire Landlord.
If the bill is passed, the rental incomes will go down,then at least some of us would be
put into a dire financial plight.
It would make more sense to raise the housing assistance funds so that landlords can 
financially be able to afford to be offer so called "low income housing."
