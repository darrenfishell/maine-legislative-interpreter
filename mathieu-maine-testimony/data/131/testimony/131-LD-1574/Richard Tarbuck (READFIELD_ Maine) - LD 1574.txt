LD 1574
I oppose LD 1574 on the overall grounds that it DISCOURAGES rather than 
encourages the development of new rental housing.  Furthermore, this legislation 
seems to complicate unnecessarily the joint tenant-landlord tenancy at will agreement 
which currently benefits both parties. If a tenant finds a new job in a new location, 
there is no lease impeding his or her accepting it. Introducing restrictions does not 
seem to provide any such benefit to the landlord. Of course, statewide rent control 
only adds one more hurdle for landlords and will only serve to depress interest in 
developing new housing units.
