Good
morning,
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary.
My
name
is
Frank
D’Alessandro,
and
I
am
the
Legal
Services
Director
of
Maine
Equal
Justice.
We
are
a
civil
legal
services
organization,
and
we
work
with
and
for
people
with
low
income
seeking
solutions
to
poverty
through
policy,
education,
and
legal
representation.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
offer
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1574.
Maine
Equal
Justice
supports
LD
1574.
Mainers’
health,
wellbeing,
and
economic
stability
all
start
at
home,
and
there
is
no
worse
threat
to
a
family’s
stability
than
eviction—or
the
forcible
removal
from
that
home.
Eviction
is
not
just
a
condition
of
poverty,
but
a
cause
of
it,
as
it
forces
families
out
of
their
communities
away
from
their
support
systems,
makes
children
change
schools,
negatively
affects
mental
health,
and
causes
job
loss.
No
one
should
lose
their
home
and
risk
becoming
homeless
if
they
haven’t
done
anything
wrong.
LD
1574
will
help
prevent
unnecessary
evictions
and
ensure
housing
stability
for
Mainers.
What
This
Bill
Does
Under
current
law
a
landlord
may
terminate
a
tenancy
at
will
by
serving
the
tenant
with
either
a
30
day
notice
or
a
7
day
notice.
Under
current
law
and
this
bill,
a
landlord
may
serve
at
tenant
with
a
7
day
notice
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
14
M.R.S.
§
6001(2):
A.
The
tenant,
the
tenant's
family
or
an
invitee
of
the
tenant
has
caused
substantial

that
the
tenant
has
not
repaired
or
caused
to
be
repaired
before
the
giving
of
the
notice
provided
in
this
subsection;
B.
The
tenant,
the

human
habitation
or
has
violated
or
permitted
a
violation
of
the
law
regarding
the
tenancy;

C.
The
tenant
is
7
days
or
more
in
arrears
in
the
payment
of
rent;
D.
The

is
a
perpetrator
of
domestic
violence,
sexual
assault
or
stalking
and
the
victim
is
also
a
tenant;
E.
The
tenant
or
the
tenant's
guest
or
invitee
is
the
perpetrator
of
violence,
a
threat
of
violence
or
sexual
assault
against
another
tenant,
a
tenant's
guest,
the
landlord
or
the
landlord's
employee
or
agent,
except
that
this
paragraph
does
not
apply
to
a
tenant
who
is
a
victim
as
defined
in
section
6000,
subsection
4
and
who
has
taken
reasonable
action
under
the
circumstances
to
comply
with
the
landlord's
request
for
protection
of
the
tenant,
another
tenant,
a
tenant's
guest
or
invitee,
the
landlord
or
the
landlord's
employee
or
agent
or
of
the
landlord's
property;
or
F.
The
person
occupying
the
premises
is
not
an
authorized
occupant
of
the
premises.
What
This
Bill
Does
Not
Do
●
This
bill
does
not
extend
the
time
to
evict
tenants
who
have
done
something
wrong
●
This
bill
does
not
prevent
a
landlord
from
terminating
a
tenancy
according
to
the
terms
of
a
lease
agreement
●
This
bill
does
not
prevent
a
landlord
from
terminating
a
tenancy
with
a
30
days
notice
at
the
end
of
a
lease
term
●
This
bill
does
not
change
the
law
for
terminating
a
tenancy
for
dwelling
units
that
contain
no
more
than
4
dwelling
units
one
of
which
is
occupied
by
the
landlord.
What
This
Bill
Does
Do
●
This
bill
will
prevent
a
landlord
from
terminating
a
tenancy
for
a
tenant
at
will
for
no
reason
unless
the
landlord
gives
the
tenant
90
days
notice
and
pays
to
the
tenant
the
equivalent
of
one
month
rent.
The
Practical
Consequences
of
This
Bill
An
at-will
tenancy
is
one
where
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
is
not
governed
by
a
lease
agreement
for
one
year
or
another
set
time
period.
It
is
sometimes
called
a“month-to-month”
tenancy.
A
study
of
Maine’s
eviction
records
done
by
Pine
Tree
Legal
Assistance
from
2019
to
2022
estimated
that
no-cause
evictions
account
for
an
average
of
19%
of
all
eviction
filings
in
Maine.With
no
cause
evictions
making
up
nearly
27%
of
all
evictions
in
2021.
Landlords
file
the
overwhelming
majority
of
evictions
in
Maine
(87%)
for
non-payment
or
another
cause.
1
According
to
Pine
Tree
Legal
Assistance,
only
5%
of
no
cause
eviction
cases
were
related
to
an
underlying
cause
due
to
tenant
behavior.
On
average
this
accounts
for
less
than
1%
of
all
eviction
cases
filed
in
the
State
of
Maine.
According
to
records
kept
by
Pine
Tree
Legal
Assistance
a
change
to
the
City
of
Portland
Ordinance
similar
to
that
proposed
in
this
bill
resulted
in
a
25%
reduction
in
no
cause
evictions
for
tenants
located
in
Portland
Maine
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
State.
This
bill
will
improve
stability
for
tenants
by
giving
them
more
time
to
plan
around
a
potential
end-date
to
their
tenancy.
As
a
result
of
this
bill,
landlords
may
also
look
increasingly
to
evict
at-will
tenants
with
7
day
notices
for
the
causes
described
above.
Though
this
will
result
in
a
shorter
notice
period,
it
will
provide
tenants
with
the
opportunity
to
defend
themselves.
Under
current
law,
tenants
have
virtually
no
defense
against
a
30
day
no-cause
eviction
notice.
Why
Maine
Equal
Justice
Supports
LD
1574
Ending
No
Cause
Evictions
W ill
Not
Decr ease
the
Development
of
Rental
Units
Initially,
it
is
important
to
note
the
private
market
in
Maine
has
consistently
failed
to
produce
a
sufficient
amount
of
rental
housing.
According
to
a
report
conducted
by
the
Maine
State
Housing
Authority
there
are
154,919
rental
housing
units
in
Maine.
Only
15,232
(less
than
10%)
of
those
units
have
been
created
since
2000.
2
Given
the
private
market’s
documented
failure
to
create
the
rental
housing
that
Maine
so
sorely
needs,
the
argument
that
the
passage
of
LD
1574
will
somehow
prevent
private
developers
from
engaging
in
a
sudden
turnaround
in
creating
new
rental
housing
seems
less
than
persuasive.
Other
states
have
a
ban
on
no
cause
evictions.
Maine’s
neighbor,
the
State
of
New
Hampshire,
has
a
ban
on
no
cause
evictions.
(N.H.
R.S.A,
Section
540,
Section
540:2).
This
section
of
law
was
initially
enacted
in
1985
and
was
last
been
amended
in
2010.
3
Maine
and
New
Hampshire
are
nearly
identical
in
population.
According
to
the
U.S.
Census
Bureau
in
2022
Maine
had
a
population
of
1,385,340
people
while
New
Hampshire
had
a
population
of
1,395,231
people.

.

Maine
has
a
shortage
of
22,498
affordable
housing
units.
5
In
comparison
New

has
a
shortage
of
20,358

units.
6
Despite
having
a
slightly
higher
population
the
need
for
affordable
housing
units
in
New
Hampshire
is
10%
less
than
what
exists
in
Maine.
In
short
there
is
no
evidence
that
passing
a
law
that
will
prevent
the
no
cause
eviction
of
tenants
will
harm
Maine’s
rental
housing
market.
Eviction
Cr eates
Disastr ous
Consequences
for
Families
No
one
should
lose
their
home
and
risk
becoming
homeless
if
they
haven’t
done
anything
wrong.
Finding
affordable
housing
in
Maine
has
become
so
difficult
that
many
Mainers
become
homeless
simply
because
they
can’t
find
an
apartment
that
meets
their
budget.
When
a
tenant
gets
a
30
day
no-cause
eviction
notice,
they
are
put
in
the
impossible
position
of
finding
a
new
apartment
and
moving
within
30
days’
notice,
or
risk
going
to
eviction
court
and
being
forcibly
removed
from
their
home.
Eviction—or
the
forcible
removal
of
a
family
from
their
home—is
often
a
traumatic
and
highly
consequential
event,
especially
for
low-income
families.
The
Eviction
Lab
at
Princeton
University,
a
leading
team
of
researchers
working
to
highlight
the
prevalence,
causes,
and
consequences
of
evictions
nationwide,
describes
the
fallout
of
eviction
this
way:
Eviction
causes
a
family
to
lose
their
home.
They
often
are
also
expelled
from
their
community
and
their
children
have
to
switch
schools.
Families
regularly
lose
their
possessions,
too,
which
are
piled
on
the
sidewalk
or
placed
in
storage,
only
to
be
reclaimed
after
paying
a
fee.
A
legal
eviction
comes
with
a
court
record,
which
can
prevent
families
from
relocating
to
decent
housing
in
a
safe
neighborhood,
because
many
landlords
screen
for
recent
evictions.
Studies
also
show
that
eviction
causes
job
loss,
as
the
stressful
and
drawn-out
process
of
being
forcibly
expelled
from
a
home
causes
people
to
make
mistakes
at
work
and
lose
their
job.
Eviction
also
has
been
shown
to
affect
people's
mental
health:
one
study
found
that
mothers
who
experienced
eviction
reported
higher
rates
of
depression
two
years
after
their
move.
The
evidence
strongly
indicates
that
eviction
is
not
just
a
condition
of
poverty,
it
is
a
cause
of
it.
Clearly,
eviction
causes
financial
losses
to
families
who
often
lose
their
possessions
and
lose
their
jobs
when
they’re
forced
from
their
homes
and
communities.
7
It
also
causes
enormous
personal
trauma
with
significant
repercussions
to
economic
and
personal
well-being.
Research
in
the
wake
of
the
foreclosure
crisis
has
tracked
how
housing
instability
negatively
influences

well-being
including
increasing
the
risk
of

in
mothers.
8
Eviction
also
increases
suicide
and
anxiety.
9
For
children,
it
results
in
emotional
and
educational
decline.
10
People
who
have
been
evicted
go
on
to
be
shadowed
by
an
eviction
judgment
on
their
record
and
damaged
credit
that
prevents
them
from
moving
forward
and
rebuilding
their
finances.
Evidence
shows
that
many
housing
providers
screen
prospective
tenants
out
of
the
application
process
based
on
the
existence
of
an
eviction
filing
in
a
tenant’s
name,
regardless
of
the
basis
or
the
legal
outcome.
11
As
a
result,
families
who
have
been
evicted
are
often
forced
into
poorer
neighborhoods
and
substandard
housing.
No
tenant
in
Maine
should
have
to
suffer
these
consequences.
But
it
is
especially
unfair
to
tenants
whose
landlords
evict
them
with
30
days’
notice
without
cause.
Though
these
tenants
have
done
nothing
wrong
except
fail
the
impossible
task
of
finding
a
new
home
and
moving
within
30
days,
they
can
suffer
devastating
financial
and
health
fallout
from
eviction
and
be
barred
from
future
housing
opportunities.
All
the
evidence
shows
that
Mainers’
health
and
well-being
starts
with
having
a
stable
home
and
the
opportunities
that
come
with
it.
LD
1574
is
a
crucial
policy
measure
because
it
will
help
prevent
unnecessary
evictions
and
ensure
housing
stability
for
more
Mainers.
Maine’ s
Housing
Crisis
Highlights
Deep
Racial
Inequality
While
housing
instability
and
eviction
is
always
tragic,
it
is
not
a
tragedy
that
befalls
all
families
equally.
Though
Maine
does
not
have
a
centralized
database
for
evictions
in
the
state,
data
from
Maine
State
Housing
Authority
has
shown
that
34%
of
Maine’s
homeless
population
on
any
given
night
is
Black
or
African
American,
though
only
1.4%
of
Maine’s
population
is
Black
or
African
American.
12
Pine
Tree
Legal
Assistance
has
also
provided
statistics
that
12%
of
households
they
represented
in
eviction
court
were
non-white,
though
only
5%
of
Maine’s
population
is
non-white.
This
reflects
national
data
evidencing
extreme
racial
disparities
in
evictions
across
the
country;
myriad
studies
have
shown
that
Black
women
are

13
Maine’s
housing
market
is
no
exception.
The
Impacts
of
No-Cause
Evictions
on
Communities
No-cause
eviction
notices
allow
landlords
to
clear
out
tenants
as
neighborhoods
gentrify.
Many
parts
of
Maine
have
been
gentrifying
for
decades,
14
but
the
pandemic
has
put
unprecedented
pressure
on
Maine’s
housing
market.
While
so
many
people
are
buying
and
renting
new
Maine
homes,
many
Mainers
are
struggling
to
stay
in
theirs.
Increasing
property
values
are
linked
to
gentrification.
Gentrification
is
a
process
which
displaces
low-income
community
members,
usually
renters,
when
more
affluent
people
move
in.
Gentrification
is
spurred
by
speculation
in
the
real
estate
market
which
incentivizes
landlords
to
raise
rents
and/or
evict
tenants
to
pursue
higher-end
development.
This
is
occurring
not
only
in
Maine’s
cities,
but
also
in
rural
parts
of
the
State
15
where
houses
and
apartments
are
increasingly
rented
out
short-term
on
platforms
like
Airbnb.
16
The
pandemic
has
only
highlighted
and
widened
power
and
wealth
disparities
between
landlords
and
tenants.
Tenants
don’t
get
any
benefits
from
the
right
to
give
their
landlord
30
days’
notice
to
end
the
tenancy
because
tenants
have
nowhere
to
move
to
since
Maine’s
rental
market
is
more
expensive
and
competitive
than
ever
before.
Maine’s
housing
market
has
gotten
so
tight
that
even
those
with
the

published
an

about
a

in
midcoast
Maine
who
are
facing
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
state
because
they
cannot
find
a

in

The
article
reports
there
are

posting
on

looking
for
apartments
than
there
are
landlords
seeking
tenants.

confront
that

in
losses

and
take
steps
to
protect
tenants
in
Maine’s
housing

The

is
tenants

would
at
minimum

tenants

and
competitive
rental

instead
of

Extr eme
Costs
to
Society
The
costs
to
families
of
displacement
and
disruption
arising
from
eviction
also
create
extreme
costs
to
society.
In
2018,
the
Philadelphia
Bar
Association
commissioned
a
comprehensive
study
on
the
cost
of
eviction
in
Philadelphia.
The
study
highlighted
the
costs
to
communities,
hospitals,
state
and
local
governments,
and
the
economy
in
general
when
people
are
evicted
from
their
homes.
Research
showed
eviction
increases
emergency
shelter
costs,
hospital
costs
(emergency
room
and
in-patient),
mental
health
costs,
administrative
burden
for
courts,
and
the
deterioration
of
communities
when
people
move
away
from
their
support
systems.
19
These
costs
are
even
greater
during
housing
shortages
when
low-income
tenants
can’t
find
replacement
housing.
Indeed,
in
Maine,
when
a
landlord
evicts
a
tenant
and
they
cannot
find
other
housing,
the
landlord
shifts
the
tenant’s
shelter
and
relocation
cost
to
the
municipality
without
cause.
The
state
General
Assistance
statute
requires
all
municipalities
to
provide
emergency
housing
assistance
to
homeless
people
who
cannot
afford
their
own
accommodations.
20
Evictions
trap
people
in
poverty
because
unstable
housing
makes
it
extremely
difficult
to
maintain
steady
employment.
21
Evictions
have
been
linked
to
psychological
trauma
and
have
been
identified
“as
a
risk
factor
for
suicide.”
22
Those
evicted
have
63%
higher
odds
of
losing
Medicaid
coverage,
and
getting
prescriptions
filled
or
storing
prescriptions
becomes
extremely
difficult.
23
A
housing
change
during
childhood
can
lead
to
half
a
year
of
loss
in
school.
24
Children
that
are
forced
to
move
three
or
more
times
generally
have
lower
earnings,
fewer
work
hours,
and
less
educational
attainment.
25
Children
with
unstable
housing
“are
more
likely
to
be
truant,
and
are
more
likely
to
drop
out”
26
and
they
“are
at
higher
risk
for
developmental
delay,
decreased
academic
achievement,
anxiety,
depression,
behavioral
disturbances,

By
giving
renters
90
days,
instead
of
the
current
30
days,
many
of
the
ill
effects
of
unstable
housing
that
come
with
eviction
can
be
mitigated.
This
Bill
Does
Not
Interfer e
W ith
Landlords’
Rights
Landlords
may
argue
that
this
bill
eliminates
an
important
landlord
right:
the
right
to
recover
their
property
at
any
time,
for
any
reason
(or
without
a
reason),
with
30
days’
notice.
However,
this
is
a
mischaracterization
of
the
30
day
no-cause
notice
provision
in
14
M.R.S.
§
6002.
It
does
not
exist
to
protect
a
landlord’s
property
rights.
It
is
a
tenant
protection.
The
Legislature
can
and
should
strengthen
it
to
protect
tenants’
and
society’s
interests
in
stable
housing.
Property
owners
have
the
privilege,
not
the
right,
to
profit
by
renting
their
buildings
out
to
tenants.
Landlords
are
justifiably
subject
to
regulation
to
ensure
that
their
business
operations
do
not
harm
others.
This
includes
keeping
up
the
health
and
safety
conditions
of
their
buildings
under
state
and
local
code,
renting
to
tenants
on
fair
and
conscionable
terms,
and
not
forcibly
removing
tenants
from
their
homes
without
due
process.
Maine’s
requirement
of
a
minimum
30
days’
written
notice
to
terminate
a
tenancy-at-will
dates
to
1863.
Shortly
after
its
enactment,
the
Law
Court
explained,
“The
object
of
the
statute
undoubtedly
was
to
prevent
a
breach
of
the
peace,
by
protecting
the
tenant
from
molestation
at
the
hands
of
his
landlord,
until
he
shall
have
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
provide
himself
with
other
accommodations.”
28
As
far
back
as
1863,
the
Maine
Legislature
recognized
that
government
must
protect
tenants
in
evictions
to
prevent
the
hardship
caused
when
tenants
are
evicted
and
can’t
find
replacement
housing.
As
the
Law
Court
described,
these
outcomes
affect
not
only
tenants,
but
also
the
public
by
creating
a
“breach
of
the
peace.”
The
policy
reasons
for
protecting
tenants’
rights
in
eviction
have
even
more
weight
today.
Maine’s
rental
market
has
gotten
more
competitive
and
expensive
than
ever.
We
know
that
the
social
and
economic
costs
of
eviction
and
homelessness
are
vast.
The
effects
of
eviction
ripple
far
beyond
an
individual
landlord’s
building
and
business
and
must
be
taken
into
account
in
devising
sensible
policy
solutions
for
the
housing
crisis.
The
Legislature
can
and
should
strengthen
protections
for
tenants
by
extending
the
30
day
no
cause
notice
provision
to
90
days
for
tenants
at
will.
This
will
promote
housing
stability
and
help
ensure
that
low-income
tenants
do
not
become
homeless
when
they
have
not
done
anything
wrong.

that
Maine

immediately
as
a

towards
ending
Maine’s
