Neither for n or Against  
 
LD 1402  - An Act to Provide an Additional Allocation in the School Funding Formula to Cover Tax -
exempt Property or a Large Economically Disadvantaged Student Population  
 
April 12 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony neither for nor against   
LD 1402 on behalf of Maine Municipal  Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 For municipalities  that have a multitude of tax -exempt  organizations operating within their borders, LD 
1402 would essentially level the playing field, as  those communities are unable to tax such organizations  
to support public education. It would also benefit those communities  where at least 50% of the students 
are economically disadvantaged.  
 However, this would not benefit all municipalities and as such causes concern that this bill would have the potential to pit communities against each other. Local leaders also expressed concern that the funding mechanism proposed would use funds that are typically carried over thus reducing the strain to raise local dollars.   
 
For these reasons the LPC is neither for nor against LD 1402. T hank you for your time and for considering 
the municipal perspective on this issue.
