Cultural Affairs Committee : 
 
LD 1402 , An Act to Provide an Additional Allocation in the School Funding Formula to Cover Tax -
exempt Property or a Large Economically Disadvantaged Student  Population  (EMERGENCY) , 
proposes to provide an additional allocation of school funding for a school administrative unit in 
which at least 15% of the school administrative unit (SAU) has tax -exempt property that cannot 
be levied.  
 
While the Department of Education is in support of considering alternative metrics for 
distributing the local and state share of educational costs, it is not certain that the specified data 
would deliver more equity. One concern is that adding another adjustment to SAU s with at l east 
a 50% population of economically disadvantaged students is going to further complicate the 
already difficult process of collecting data related to the current  definition of economically 
disadvantaged students.  Further, t he Department does not have access to the information that 
provides tax exempt property status , and the Maine  Revenue Services is unable to provide the 
necessary data.   
 
As outlined in Title 20 -A, Chapter 606 -B ยง15686 -A the Maine Department of Education is 
engaged in on -going review of the metrics that contribute to the Essential Programs and Services 
(EPS) funding formula. In addition, our Title I Team is exploring the data points that inform 
those allocations to SAUs. Ma ine currently uses alternative data sets to make these calculations 
that include post -pandemic information, district -certified student counts, implementation of no -
cost meals, and a weighted per -pupil allocation.   
 
It is also important to note the interco nnectedness of EPS funding formula components. 
Individual component adjustments to the EPS formula always have positive and negative impacts 
on SAUs.  Given the finite amount of funding, a calculation to increase one segment will 
necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine any one element in the 
context of a comprehensive study.  In order to make equitable decisions that cause the  least harm

to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate time and resources to analyze the implications 
of any change.  
 
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1402  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
