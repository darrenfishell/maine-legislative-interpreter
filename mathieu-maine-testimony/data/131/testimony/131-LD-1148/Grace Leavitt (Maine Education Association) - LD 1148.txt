Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
April 3, 2023 
  
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee,  
 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher.  The MEA 
represents nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well 
as in our institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine 
Community College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired 
educators. 
 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in opposition to LD 1148 An Act to Prohibit COVID-19 Vaccine 
Mandates for Students Enrolled in Public Institutions of Learning, and LD 1228 An Act to Prohibit 
Certain Higher Education Institutions from Requiring Vaccines Approved Under Emergency Use 
Authorization for Admission or Attendance. 
 
We all agree on one thing, I am sure. And that is that we hope never to see another pandemic like what 
we have been experiencing since COVID-19 hit us in the spring of 2020.  
 
But as much as we may all have this hope, the reality is that this could be something we face again. If we 
should be so unfortunate as to have this happen, our institutions of higher education should be able to 
determine what is in the best interests of their students, as well as faculty and staff, in order to keep 
everyone as safe as possible. 
 
For anyone who has been a student on a college or university campus, you know that typically there is a 
close sense of community. And most, if not all, students reside on campus in close quarters. It is best to 
have those who are responsible for providing safe learning as well as safe living conditions for the 
campus community be the ones to make the decisions about what actions might need to be taken should 
we again need to deal with an unforeseen situation such as a global pandemic. 
 
We urge you to oppose LD 1148 and LD 1228.
