LD 1148, An Act to Prohibit COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates for
Students Enrolled in Public Institutions of Learning
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield.  I urge you to support LD 1148's prohibiting of Covid-19 
vaccine mandates for public school students.
Regardless of individual's varying beliefs about the safety and efficacy of this or any given vaccine, it 
is wrong for governments to mandate certain health procedures, medications, or immunizations.
To take or not to take any immunization is a significant health decision. And in some cases it is a life or
death decision.
In the case of children and students, parents should be the ones to decide which vaccines they will or 
will not receive, not the government.
We are supposed to be living in a Constitutional Republic in which the people grant the government 
certain, specific powers, and this is not one of them.  For the government to take this power upon itself 
is to violate our rights as citizens.
How? Because the Fourteenth Amendment of Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from 
unjustly depriving us of life, liberty, or property.  It also prohibits the making of laws which abridge the
privileges or immunities of U.S. Citizens.
Vaccine mandates effectually violate both these prohibitions. Therefore, I ask you not to only support 
LD 1148 but also to fight for the freedom we ought to have to make our own immunization decisions 
without having to go begging for it. Thank you.
