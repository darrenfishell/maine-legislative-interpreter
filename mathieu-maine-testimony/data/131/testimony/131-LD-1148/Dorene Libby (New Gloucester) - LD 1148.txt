LD 1148
Chair and Members of this Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to support passage of LD 1148 Those of you that 
choose to serve are bound by oath to protect the private rights of the People.  Access 
to education should not be dependent on relinquishing the natural rights of the People.
Passage of LD 1148 restores the liberty interests of the People, which includes our 
liberty interest over the health determinations for our children.  Passage of LD 1148 is
a great example of government servants adhering to their oath to honor the Maine 
Constitution and to protect rights.
