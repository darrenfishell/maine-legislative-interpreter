LD 1148
Distinguished members of the Education and Cultural Committee, 
I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD 1148. Maine's children, including my 
own, deserve the opportunity to attend school.  The parent's of Maine schoolchildren 
deserve to not have to make a choice between a COVID vaccine and their children 
being able to attend school.
Thank you,
Dorothy Kinchen
