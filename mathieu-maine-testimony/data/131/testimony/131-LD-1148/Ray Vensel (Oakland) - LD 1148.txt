LD 1148  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational & Cultural Affairs 
Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1148.  
LD 1148 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable.  
Prohibiting the schools mentioned from requiring emergency use vaccines is a barrier to 
emergency responses to an immediate public health danger. This is contrary to accepted science 
and introduces an unnecessary barrier to emergency response.  
In the event of an emergency, the needs of public health demand that there be no barriers to 
emergency measures. Vaccines approved under emergency use help to prevent deaths.  
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
