TESTIMONY IQ MAINE LEGISLATURE HJDICIARY COMMITTEE 
MAY 8, 2023' 
RE: LD 657 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Cormnittee: 
My name is William Richards. I live in the Brookside Condominium Association in Yarmouth. 
Although I am a past president of the Association, I am not speaking for the Association. I am 
here today as one of several individual members who believe our current condo fees, assessments, 
etc., are grossly unfair.‘ 
As you may know, each unit owner in a condominium has a percentage share of “undivided 
common interest ” in the common area of the association: that is, the land, the shell of the buildings, 
and amenities. This percentage determines the condo fee and any special assessment. 
Brookside has six unit plans, ranging in size from 2,000 square feet to l,600 square feet (and one 
of l,l00 square feet, because the second floor was never built out). 
The developers assigned each plan a different percentage of undivided common interest, and thus 
different condo fees. Size was not a factor: Four plans have higher fees than the largest plan. On 
the other side is a table showing size, the percentage of undivided interest assigned to each plan, 
and its current condo fee. 
The only rationale the developers gave for their percentage assignments was differences in “market 
value.” They did not offer any explanation of how those values were determined. They ignored 
the fact that for any given unit plan, most had basements but some did not. They also ignored the 
fact that values of individual units would change over time, some more than others, depending on 
owner upgrades and renovations. 
The consequence for us is that the highest monthly condo fee is 25% higher than the lowest fee— 
$502 compared to $402. . For the record, I own that 1,100 square feet unit. My fee is $500.49. 
Over 30 years of ownership, we have paid about $3 0,000 more in fees, plus signiﬁcantly more in 
assessments. 
Recognizing how unfair our fees are, many members would -be willing to change the percentage 
structure. But “many” is not enough. Under current law, “all” have to agree to a change. If you 
were paying $401.61, you might not want to increase your payment. 
This bill is a welcome start, and I hope you pass it. However, it would likely have no impact on 
what the developers stuck us with. In our situation, 44 out of 48 votes would be required. Just5 
owners can quash the change. 9 of our members are paying the lowest fee. 
So, rushing in where angels fear to tread, I ask you to consider 75% as the required percentage. 
That’s the same percentage required for a change in our Declaration. Brookside and other 
associations with unfair fees would then have a reasonable chance to move to equal fees for all 
units. 
Finally, I also ask you to clarify paragraph (d)(2). It seems to conflict with paragraph (d)(l). 
Thank you for your time here today and for your service to the people of Maine.
