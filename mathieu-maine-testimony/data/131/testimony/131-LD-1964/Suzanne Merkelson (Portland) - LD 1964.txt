Testimony of Suzanne Merkelson before the Labor and Housing Committee in 
SUPPORT of LD 1964.
Distinguished members of the Labor and Housing Committee, my name is Suzanne 
Merkelson and I am a resident of Portland. I am also a new mom -- my son was born 
6 months ago after a difficult labor. I was extremely lucky to have nearly 6 months of 
paid parental leave given by my employer, but I recognize that I am in the minority of
Mainers in having that much time. However, I really needed that time to recover and 
take care of my baby. 12 weeks should be the bare minimum available to birthing 
parents. Additionally, even with 6 months leave for myself and 6 weeks for my 
husband, we still have a significant gap before we're able to get our child into full 
time childcare (even though I signed up for 12 daycare waitlists when I was 8 weeks 
pregnant!). I urge you to pass this important bill to support Maine families and 
empower Maine employers.
