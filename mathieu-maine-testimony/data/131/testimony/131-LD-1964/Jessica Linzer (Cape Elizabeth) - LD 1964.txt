Re: Testimony regarding LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to 
Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program 
Position:  Support 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and Distinguished Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
I am writing in support of LD1964, a bill whose time has come and whose benefits 
would make a tremendous difference in the lives of Maine workers and families. 
I retired to Maine in 2010 after a 35 year career with the Social Security Administration 
in NY and NJ.  Over the decades, I helped countless individuals and families apply for 
permanent disability benefits when the state based benefits they received in those 
states expired after 26 weeks of temporary disability. The residents there were very 
fortunate that they were covered by a source of income for 5 months when illness or 
injury struck and a person could not work.   
In Maine, the Earned Pay Leave Law, enacted January 1, 2021, allows only 5 days of 
paid leave for employees.  For those who are diagnosed with an illness or injury where 
they need treatment, or for those who welcome a new child to their family, and 
especially for those whose employer does not provide paid family or medical leave, 40 
hours is woefully inadequate.  
We all know that life and health can change in an instant. When it does change, we 
need to be able pay our rent, our mortgages, our taxes, buy food, put the lights and heat  
on and just deal with getting well instead of worrying about a total loss of income. 
Please help strengthen the economic fabric of Maine families by passing the Paid 
Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.   
Please vote “Ought to Pass” on LD1964.  
Thank you for all you do, 
Sincerely, 
Jessica D Linzer (aka Jessica Simpson)
