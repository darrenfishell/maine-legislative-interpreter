I am holding my newborn baby girl while typing this. At 4 weeks postpartum, I will 
be returning to work in the service industry. This is before my stitches will have been 
removed and before the recommended 12 weeks down time by both my doctors and 
pediatricians. 
My situation is not unique and I ﬁnd myself in the same position of having to choose 
between ﬁnancial or physical health, and both are interconnected. 
My partner works full time in flooring and has been unable to take any time off in 
order to continue to try and support both of us during these 4 weeks. The cost of 
living over the years has increased astronomically and of course we want to raise our 
family safely. 
This program would help our family thrive in Maine. We are good Workers, we are 
good parents, and this program would help us be sure we could return to the 
workforce.
