Testimony In Support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to 
Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program 
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Anne White and I live in Greene. I am testifying in support of LD 1964 which seeks to 
implement the recommendations of the commission to develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave 
benefits program. Too many Mainers must make the difficult decision of how to provide care for a loved 
one when they are working without the benefit of paid time off. This includes adult children researching 
ways to care for a parent suffering from dementia, women caring for their infant after childbirth or 
perhaps a Mainer caring for a family member recovering from an accident. Oftentimes, these are people 
in lower paying jobs who can least afford to take unpaid time off. Passage of this bill will help to relieve 
some of the stress many Mainers face with these challenges. 
I urge you to pass LD 1964. Thank you for your time. 
Anne White
