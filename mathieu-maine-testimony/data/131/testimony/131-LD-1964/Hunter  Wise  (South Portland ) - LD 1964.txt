PFML is long overdue. I am not a  parent but I strongly believe that Maine should 
have a mandated paid family medical leave program of AT LEAST 12 weeks. That is 
the base minimum new parents should be able to have with their new children - 
employers can then tack on more if they'd like. Thank you!
