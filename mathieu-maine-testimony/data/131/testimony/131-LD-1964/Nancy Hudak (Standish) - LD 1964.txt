LD 1964
I urge the Committee to support An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program. The 
Commission spent a great deal of time considering the implications of the bill and 
determined that such leave would be beneficial to employees, employers, and the 
state.
Although subject to improvement, either this year or in future legislative sessions, 
LD1964 is vital to the well-being of Maine citizens. The business coalition objection 
that such a law is not feasible is belied by the fact that many other states - and almost 
all countries around the world - have similar laws. 
The federal Family Medical Leave Act is valuable, but it does not provide *paid* 
leave. Many Maine workers have difficulty taking time off from work for even a day, 
let alone several weeks, and the FMLA can be tricky to navigate.
At a time the state is looking to attract workers, this law would be a boon to the state's
economy and to the businesses which object to it.  Both employees and employers 
would contribute to the program, so the impact would felt - like Worker's 
Compensation - by both parties.
