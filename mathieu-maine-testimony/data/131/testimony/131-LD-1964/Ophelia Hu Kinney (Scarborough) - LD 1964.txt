My name is Ophelia Hu Kinney, and I live in Scarborough with my wife and our 
newborn daughter.
Today, I happen to finish my three-month parental leave made possible by my 
employer. We are thrilled to be raising our family here in Maine. The postpartum 
experience has been perhaps the most challenging thing I've done in my life, and I can
scarcely understand how new parents undertake this without paid family leave.
In the first two weeks postpartum, my body was exhausted and my hormones were 
regulating. I worked around the clock to feed our child and attempt to take care of 
myself. For many weeks after that, I was still acclimating to life with a newborn.
My postpartum experience included the best of scenarios. Most new parents are less 
fortunate than I was. If we value families in Maine, then we must not penalize them 
for growing. Requiring paid family leave is the least our state can do to protect 
families and give our children a healthy start in life.
