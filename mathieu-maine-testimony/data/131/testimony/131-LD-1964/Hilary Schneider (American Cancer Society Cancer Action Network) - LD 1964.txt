Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director,  
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  
 
In Support of LD 1964  “An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid 
Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program ” 
May 24, 2023  
Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder , and members of the Labor and Housing  Committee . My name is Hilary 
Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the North Atlantic  Region for the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the lead Government Relations Director 
for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer Society, supports 
evidence -based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health problem. As the 
nation’s leading advocate for public policies that ar e helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures that cancer 
patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public policy matters at all levels of government.  
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to submit the following testimony  in support of LD 1964  because 
ACS CAN supports policies at the national, state and local levels that increase access to job -protected paid family 
& medical leave that can be used for cancer treatments, survivorship care, and caregiving as well as other 
illnes ses. 
The need for access to paid medical & family leave became clearer nationwide during the COVID -19 Public 
Health Emergency. The availability of paid family and medical leave for people with and caring for individuals 
who have a serious  illness or health  condition is vital, as treatment for and recovery from serious illnesses and 
conditions are often  difficult and time consuming. The flexibility to balance treatment and employment is 
essential for patients and  caregivers. For example, multiple studies sho w that cancer patients and caregivers 
who have paid leave have  higher rates of job retention and lower rates of financial burden than those who do 
not have access to paid  leave.i,ii,iii Not all patients or caregivers have access to paid family and medical leave, and 
without it they risk  financial hardship or not getting the care they or their loved ones need . 
 
The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) conducted multiple surveys in 2017 - 2021 to 
explore the impact of paid family and  medical leave on  cancer patients, survivors and caregivers.iv The survey 
results showed that access to paid medical/family leave makes an important difference for cancer patients, 
survivors and their caregivers; contributing to positive outcomes like bein g able to complete treatment, manage 
symptoms and side effects and afford treatments.  The survey results also showed that, access to paid leave is a 
health equity issue.  Respondents who reported having issues with cancer/caregiving and their job – includin g the 
quality of their work suffering, having to take two or more days off of work in a row, or having to leave work 
early – most often tended to be those in lower income households, those with lower levels of education, 
younger respondents, and those work ing in smaller companies.  Additionally, those respondents who had paid 
medical/family leave were less likely to report experiencing problems related to financial pressures than those 
who did not have it.

  fight cancer.org | 1.800 .227.2345  About 1 in 4 employees (24 percent) in the private sector workforce have access to paid family leavev  and only 
two in five have access to short -term disability insurance through their jobs that allows them to receive partial 
pay while they recover from their own serious health issue.vi People of color and those with low er incomes are 
less likely to have access to paid family medical leave. These groups of people are also disproportionately 
impacted by diseases like cancer  - meaning the very patients who are more likely to need to use paid family and 
medical leave are the ones least likely to have acc ess to it . 
 
For the above reasons, we urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1964 . We appreciate your time and 
consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about this testimony.
