LD 1964
As a small business owner here in Maine with 10 employees the proposed Act LD 
1964, although laudable in its desire to provide additional protections to employees 
appears in my opinion to be overly broad, ill defined and will result in further adverse 
impacts on the overall employment picture here in Maine.  Although our business 
enjoys a level of success which enables us to provide these benefits through the 
insurance marketplace, I believe that forcing this onto all employers regardless of size
imposes an undue burden.
