Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing,  
 
My name is Rachel and I live in Portland, Maine. I am here today in support of paid family and medical 
leave for Maine.  
 
As a full-time working mom of two, I have experienced this issue first hand. While I was fortunate to 
take 12 weeks of leave after the birth of each of my children, most of it was unpaid. It was financially 
difficult to do so and created a lot of stress for my husband and me as we coped with a decreased 
income and increased expenses due to our expanding family.  
 
Many women in Maine return to work only weeks after giving birth because of the lack of paid leave. 
This negatively impacts the womenâ€™s health and the health of their newborns. It takes weeks to heal 
from birth and those early weeks are critical for mother-baby bonding.  
 
If Maine had paid leave, women and children would benefit, but so would employers and our 
community as a whole. If we want to support young families, passing paid leave is a critical piece of the 
puzzle. Knowing they have time to heal and bond with their baby while also receiving their income 
would be life-changing for new mothers.  
 
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening to my story and others shared today.  
 
Sincerely,  
Rachel Katyl
