LD 1964
Dear Labor and Housing Committee, my name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China 
Village. I am writing today to ask you to support LD1964. 
This affects me, because this bill would have helped me so much when I was taking 
care of my grandfather while I was finishing my last years of college. As the only 
other adult in my family, my mom didn't have paid leave- in fact she was under so 
much scrutiny from her corporate employer, because they were readily firing people 
who were thinking about retiring. This meant that I had to transfer schools, move 
across the country with what little I had in my savings, to keep my grandfather alive, 
while I was finishing up my education. I didn't have a traditional college experience, I
had to find work that would accept the fact that I was taking care of my grandfather, 
so I could still pay bills, finish school, and help him. I learned the hard way, that 
companies don't care about their workers, unless the government incentivizes them 
too- and it's affected my work history, my mental health, my savings account, my 
relationships - compared to other people my age. If there was a system like Paid leave
that could have helped me earlier on, I probably would have started my career on 
more equal footing, earned more money, had better mental health, and my mom 
would have been able to be there for her father too at the very beginning. This is why 
I support LD1964. This bill was needed a long time ago- and it's about time we enact 
it.
