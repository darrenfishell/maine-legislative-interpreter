Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Greg Soutiea and we live in St. George. I am writing today to oppose the 
Sponsor’s amendment LD 1964, “An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.” This 
proposal is one of the most benefit rich and
expensive in the country and is not in line with the needs of Maine’s businesses.
We purchased our business about 4 years ago and have grown it from a sleepy 
inn/restaurant employing about 7 people seasonally to employing about 50 in peak 
season and keeping a year round staff of 25-30. These tax increases would cut into 
our ALREADY THIN margins of running a restaurant and negatively impact our 
staff. 
Please vote LD 1964 ought not to pass. As crafted this proposal would likely cause 
harm to my business, and other Maine businesses as well as the state's greater 
economy. 
Sincerely, 
Greg and Lauren Soutiea
