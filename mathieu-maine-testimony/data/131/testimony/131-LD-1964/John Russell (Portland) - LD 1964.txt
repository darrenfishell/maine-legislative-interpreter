LD 1964
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and distinguished Members of the 
Committee,
My name is John Russell, and I am an owner of The Merchant Company on Congress 
Street in Portland, Maine. I request you vote to support LD 1964, An Act to 
Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and 
Medical Leave Benefits Program.
My business, the Merchant Company, has been in business since 2011. Our 
consignment shop is filled with the work of hundreds of local artists. Like our fellow 
small businesses, we’re a vital thread in the tapestry of our local economy. 
I am calling on you to pass LD 1964 to provide small business owners like me and 
employees with much-needed financial security to deal with major life events without
jeopardizing our livelihoods. As a small business owner, I do not currently have 
access to paid family and medical leave. Since we’re all human beings who can get 
sick or hurt, any of us could need the safety net that paid leave provides. 
While I am relieved that the bill exempts employers of less than 15 employees from 
paying the employer contribution, I do not support an exemption for small businesses 
relating to retaliation or job protection. If employees of small businesses can’t take 
leave without the fear of retaliation or losing their jobs, they cannot access the 
program. I urge you to make sure that no one faces retaliation or job loss for taking 
leave that they need and deserve. 
I also believe this program should be a public insurance plan administered by our 
government. Privatization often leads to higher costs and worse services while a big 
insurance company makes a profit. 
Please vote to support LD 1964 to provide paid family and medical leave for all 
Mainers!
Sincerely,
John Russell
Portland, ME
