As a full time working mother who experienced an extremely difficult labor and 
recovery I know firsthand how important it is to have paid family and medical leave. 
Almost every developed country has this for families but the US. Having the time to 
heal, take care of newborns, and develop as a family should not be up to luck and 
privilege. This is a right that everyone should have, Mainers included! It’s still not 
enough but it’s a start and it’s the right thing to do. I support paid family and medical 
leave benefits for Maine.
