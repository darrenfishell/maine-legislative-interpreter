LD 1964 is not right for Maine small business Right Now!
As the owner of 5 restaurants in the southern part of the state , I am deeply concerned 
about the impact of this bill.    At at time when most businesses can't find proper 
staffing or have to pay exorbitant wages to keep staff, the timing is not right.  The 
burden placed on small business in the post covid era continues to make it a difficult 
environment and at some point it will not be worth the risk in a state made of  
primarily small business.    My understanding is that that similar bills in some of our 
neighboring New England states are on a volunteer basis so please don't force another
unwanted tax on us .  Instead, 
 perhaps monies can be devoted to child care so that more can go back into the 
workforce in this time of crisis.
