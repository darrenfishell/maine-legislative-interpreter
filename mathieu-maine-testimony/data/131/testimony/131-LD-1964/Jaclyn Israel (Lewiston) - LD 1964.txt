As someone who has helped pregnant people deliver hundreds of babies, the body 
requires time to heal. As someone who has provided medical care to those hundreds 
of babies and watched them grow up, the early childhood period is the most essential 
for healthy development. The care to both parent and child during this time period is 
crucial and we should be supporting people through that time by granting people the 
right to care for their newborn children, protected from fear of retribution, instability, 
etc. These children are the future of Maine. Please vote in favor of paid family and 
medical leave benefits to support the future of Maine.
