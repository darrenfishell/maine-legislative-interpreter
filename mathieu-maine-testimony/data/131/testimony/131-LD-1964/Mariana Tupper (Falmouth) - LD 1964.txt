THIS IS WHY I SUPPORT PAID FAMILY LEAVE: “Countries that make the 
deepest investments in their people, particularly through universal programs that 
benefit all citizens, have the lowest rates of poverty, including among households 
headed by single mothers. We could follow suit by investing in programs to help 
single parents balance work and family life, programs such as PAID FAMILY 
LEAVE, affordable childcare, and universal pre-K. Instead, we’ve increasingly 
privatized daycare...[effectively making it]... impossible for many single parents to go
back to school or work full-time. Choosing to have a child outside of marriage may be
an individual choice, but condemning many of those parents and their children to a 
life of poverty is a societal one.”
