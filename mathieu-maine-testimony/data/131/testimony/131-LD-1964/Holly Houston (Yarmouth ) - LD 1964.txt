Testimony In Support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program

Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Holly Houston and I live in Yarmouth. I am testifying in support of paid 
family and medical leave for Maine. 
My husband and I have two amazing children.  I am a public school teacher and feel 
very lucky to have been able to take leave to be with each of them for the first few 
months of their lives.  It not only helped me adjust to being a mother, but allowed me 
to breastfeed my children and recover from some minor birthing-related health issues.
I believe every woman in Maine deserves the chance to be with her child for at least a
few months after birth- without fear of losing her job or not being paid.
The United States is one of the very few countries in the WORLD that does not have 
a paid family leave system and that is inexcusable and fixable.  Let's fix that statistic 
for Maine! 
If this law passed, Maine families would be assured their children would have a 
healthier start to the world, possibly having fewer expensive health issues later in life.
Stress on mothers and families would be reduced and quality of family life would be 
improved. 
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, Iâ€™m happy to answer any 
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Holly Houston
