Testimony in Favor of L.D. 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and Esteemed Members of the Committee on
Labor and Housing,
I write in strong support of L.D. 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of
the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.  As 
I write to you today, my eldest daughter is one and a half weeks away from delivering
my first grandchild.  After living in Spain for four years, she returned to Maine (to my
delight) about 3 years ago.  She is fortunate to work for a company that offers a 
generous maternity leave package that combined with her earned vacation time, will 
allow her to take several months off after her delivery.  Her partner, however, is in a 
very different situation.  
His company will only allow 2 weeks of paid vacation time for his paternity leave.  
Their financial situation is such that he cannot take off without pay.  They are 
fortunate to have myself and my husband nearby, as should my daughter be ill, or 
have any post-birth complications, we can step afford to step in to help if needed.  I 
think about all those families who do not have other that option.  Or if Jeff would 
have more time with the baby if there was a statewide paid family leave program.
I also believe that such a program will attract more young families to Maine, or keep 
them here.  As one of the oldest states in the nation, we need to attract and retain 
many more young families to fulfill our workforce needs.
I ask you to vote to pass L.D. 1964 and thank you for your time and hard work.
