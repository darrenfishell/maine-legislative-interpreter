Sarah Roberts
Peaks Island
LD 1964
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Committee,
My name is Sarah Roberts, and I am a resident of Peaks Island, Maine. Today I am 
asking you to support LD 1964.
I never expected to become a member of the sandwich generation, caring for both 
young children and an incapacitated parent at the age of 34, when my youngest child 
was barely one year old. But last summer, just six months after returning from 
maternity leave, still living in a fog of post-partum anxiety, and trying to keep up with
my work and day-to-day life as a parent, my dad was injured in a freak accident. He 
suffered a spinal cord injury, was unable to move any part of his body below his 
chest, couldn’t speak, and breathed with the assistance of a ventilator. He passed 
away due to complications after 7 weeks in an intensive care unit.
I am incredibly fortunate to have an accommodating employer who allowed me 
flexibility to work when I could. This allowed me to listen in on rounds with the 
doctors, advocate for my dad’s comfort, and support my stunned and grieving mother.
Most importantly it allowed me to spend my dad’s last days right where I belonged, 
with him.
I am not sure what I would have done without that flexibility, and it pains me to think 
of the many caregivers who simply do not have this option. People should not have to 
choose between putting food on the table and caring for a loved one, or themselves. 
LD 1964 would mean that more Mainers would not have to make these impossible 
decisions during some of the most difficult moments of their lives. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Sarah Goodman
