Testimony to the 131st Maine Legislature  
Committee on Labor and Housing  
 
Gree�ngs, Senator Tipping, Representa�ve Roeder, and honorable members of the Commitee. My name 
is Jim Roche, President of the Maine Bankers Associa�on. We are the state- wide trade associa�on 
represen�ng Maine’s banking industry.  Maine’s twenty -nine retail banks operate 443 oﬃces in nearly 
every community across the state, employ 9,000 work ing men and women, and assist Maine ci�zens and 
businesses with ﬁnancial decisions that improve the quality of life for everyone. With assets exceeding 
$41 billion, the Maine banking industry provides the ﬁnancial fuel that powers the state’s economy. Banks 
in Maine provide safe and secure deposit services for our communi�es and are a cri�cal source of 
ﬁnancing for homeownership and small businesses. Last year, our banks provided over $4.7 billion in business loans, and another $4.6 billion in residen �al real estate loans.    
  
The Maine Bankers Associa�on oﬀers this tes�mony regarding L.D. 1964, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Beneﬁts Program . We 
respec�ully oppose the bill in i ts current form.  
  
The proposed program would be funded by a new income tax increase for all workers, with mandatory universal par�cipa�on. We are deeply concerned about the ability of Maine workers to absorb an addi�onal cost increase amidst record inﬂ a�on and price increases for nearly all essen�al goods and 
services. Addi�onally, this program will increase taxes for employers across the state. Maine already has a challenging climate for business. This proposal will increase and exacerbate those ch allenges. Our state 
must consider the compe��veness of our business environment rela�ve to other states, and this bill would clearly put Maine at a further disadvantage.   
  
Many employers, certainly most banks, already oﬀer generous paid family leave b eneﬁts. In today’s �ght 
labor market, employers are keenly aware that they must oﬀer atrac�ve compensa�on and employee 
beneﬁts to atract and keep the caliber of employees they need to operate successfully. The case for paid 
leave beneﬁts is alread y being made by the very �ght and compe��ve labor market we ﬁnd ourselves in. 
It’s inappropriate for government to interfere with the marketplace by overriding employer beneﬁt 
choices. Banks already oﬀer some of the strongest beneﬁts packages of any  employers, but they do so as 
an inten�onal choice. This is a business decision each enterprise makes independently.  
 In addi�on to paid family leave beneﬁts, most banks and many employers oﬀer some form of insured or self- funded short term disability  compensa�on, along with long term disability insurance, when 
employees are out of work due to an injury or illness, or to compensate them when they must assist in 
caring for a family member.  We’re concerned that this proposal will incen�vize some worker s to stay out 
longer than is required for a full recovery. Employers work with their employees to get them back to work 
as soon as prac�cal. To do otherwise places a burden on remaining employees, especially in this �ght labor market, who must pick up th e absent employee’s workload.   
  
While concerned with the cost and expansiveness of this proposal, our associa�on is open to considering a paid leave program in other forms. For example, our neighbors in New Hampshire and Vermont

 established a voluntary “ opt-in” paid family leave program. This type of program allows individuals and 
businesses the choice to determine their own cost- beneﬁt analysis most appropriate for their own needs 
and responsibili�es. Another alterna�ve would be an updated version of the family leave established 
under federal law. This op�on would provide more certainty around eligibility rules, along with guidelines 
more consistent with employer expecta�ons.  
  
In conclusion, we are open to discussion of a paid family leave program w hich me ets the needs of 
employees and businesses; however, the current proposal is too costly, too expansive, and too uncertain. 
At a �me when employers are naviga�ng the challenges of atrac�ng worker talent to their enterprises, 
high inﬂa�on, and a sluggish economy (which may soon worsen), this program is ill- �med and ill -
conceived.  
 
We thank the Committee for its consideration.  
 Respectfully Submitted,  
 
James Roche  
President
