Honorable members of the Committee on Labor and Housing,
As a father and son and worker, I would like to express my support of paid family and
medical leave. When done right, PFML can improve the health of Maineâ€™s people and
economy. Senator Daughtry aptly represent me and my Pownal neighbors in the 
legislature and I laude her work on this important issue. I am involved in a number of 
business groups, like the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce, and encourage 
you to listen to the concerns raised by nonprofit and private employers. The current 
bill has room for improvement and I believe we are close to reaching a consensus 
around PFML as long we continue to nurture the Maine tradition of collaboration and 
civility. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this profoundly impactful 
legislation.
