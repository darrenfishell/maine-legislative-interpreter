LD 1964
I would like to thank the committee members for their time and allowing me to 
submit my testimony regarding LD 1964. 
LD 1964, in my opinion, places yet another finical burden not only on the employer 
but also the employee at a time where both parties are trying their best to manage 
expenses. 
To place an additional finical burden on employers and employees, instituting a 
program that could create yet another barrier to Maine's economy/business growth, 
and the use of extremely generalized wording of program usage is of concern. I 
believe that it is in Maine's best interest that this bill ought not to pass.
Again, thank you for the opportunity and your time.
