Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Rachel Bouttenot and I live in Bath. I am writing to fully support paid 
family and medical leave for Maine.
I just had my second child in October 2022. Having time off after giving birth is 
absolutely essential to bonding with the baby and being able to be present for the 
entire family. Giving birth and the weeks afterwards are really physically intense and 
full of hormonal changes. I cannot imagine trying to return to work while recovering 
from labor and while taking care of a newborn around the clock (with very little 
sleep). 
All parents should be granted at least 12 paid weeks of leave. At least! Ideally, more 
like 6-9, or even 12, months. Having a baby is hard! Babies need lots of care and 
attention. Imagine the impact on our children if their parents could actually attend to 
their needs for months rather than days or weeks following their birth. Plus, the birth 
parent should be given all the time and resources to breast/chest feed the baby. Since 
breast milk should ideally be the only source of nutrition for the first six months, that 
entire time should be paid leave. Returning to work puts the breastfeeding relationship
in jeopardy, which can have major negative effects on the health and wellbeing of the 
baby.
The cost/benefit analysis of paid family leave is clear: allowing parents to stay home 
during this critical time means fewer healthcare and educational costs as well as 
greater productivity and economic contributions by the parents.
We hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, Iâ€™m happy to answer any
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Rachel Bouttenot
