Testimony in Support of LD 1964   Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, Distinguished Members of the Labor and Housing Committee:  My name is Dr. Jay Naliboff and I am a retired OB/Gyn from Franklin County. Often I would see families with a newborn baby where the postpartum person’s partner had to go back to work shortly after the birth, depriving the mother of essential family support. Paid family leave, as  envisioned by LD 1964 would provide the opportunity for more support in this common situation.  Paid family leave would benefit Mainers in many ways. It would send a message to potential job seekers from other states that Maine is a place that respects families and “the way life should be”. It would ease the burden on families experiencing a health emergency. It simply is humane and makes sense.  I urge you therefore to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1964.  Respectfully submitted,  Jay Naliboff MD
