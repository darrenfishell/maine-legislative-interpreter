Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing,
My name is Laura and I live in Portland, Maine. I'm writing today in support of paid 
family and medical leave for Maine.
As a part-time working mom of one, I have experienced this issue first hand. While I 
was fortunate to take 8 weeks of leave after the birth of my child, it was unpaid. It 
was financially difficult to do so and created a lot of stress for my husband and me as 
we coped with a decreased income and increased expenses due to our expanding 
family.
Many women in Maine return to work only weeks after giving birth because of the 
lack of paid leave. This negatively impacts the womenâ€™s health and the health of their 
newborns. It takes weeks to heal from birth and those early weeks are critical for 
mother-baby bonding.
If Maine had paid leave, women and children would benefit, but so would employers 
and our community as a whole. If we want to support young families, passing paid 
leave is a critical piece of the puzzle. Knowing they have time to heal and bond with 
their baby while also receiving their income would be life-changing for new mothers.
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening to my story and others 
shared today.
Sincerely,
Laura Rosenberg
