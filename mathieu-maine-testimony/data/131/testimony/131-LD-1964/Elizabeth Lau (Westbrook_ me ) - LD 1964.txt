To whom it may concern, 
Giving birth is a traumatic event: physically, emotionally and mentally. It is life 
changing in so many ways and there is no way to truly prepare a person for it. We 
send mothers back into the world torn apart, literally and physically and tell them to 
get over it. After giving birth I could not physically sit down without excruciating 
pain for 6+ weeks. I am a dance teacher and I couldn’t even dream about dancing 
until the 3 month mark. And yet I was supposed to be back at work based on the 
standards of this country. Meanwhile I was so sleep deprived I wasn’t sure I should be
driving because sleep deprivation has real physical manifestations and detrimental 
affects on the body. My marriage suffered because of all that just explained and so 
much of it was because my husband went back to work 2 weeks after our baby was 
born even though I was in pain in so many ways and so ill equipped to care for an 
infant alone after the trauma that is birth. We must give our mothers the decency to 
heal at the very least. But really we should give them more. More time to adjust with 
support by their side, to acclimate to their new normal and to rest and not work after 
working all night to care for an infant. It’s inhumane. We are one of the most 
advanced countries in the world and our mothers are not being taken care of. Post 
Partum care does not exist. There should be free pelvic floor Pt and mental health 
counseling, and absolutely months of paid leave for them to do the biggest job of all. I
ask you today to support this much needed bill in an effort to give other moms the 
time they need to grieve, heal and survive the early months of motherhood.
