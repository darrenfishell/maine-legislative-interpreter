As a small year round business employing less than 5 employees, this bill would 
cripple our ability to operate by holding us financially responsible for a staff member 
for 12 weeks at a time when profit margins for restaurants, cafes and bakeries have 
never been thinner. The challenge to simply obtain staff has put immense pressure 
and additional costs on our industry, and then to try to find a 12 week gap employee 
to cover staffing, potentially during a busy tourist season, would be impossible. Our 
experience has shown that paid medical leave is also frequently abused by employees 
in our industry, and this bill as written will allow virtually brand new employees to 
take paid leave after a period of time that is barely enough to train them to be up to 
full performance.
