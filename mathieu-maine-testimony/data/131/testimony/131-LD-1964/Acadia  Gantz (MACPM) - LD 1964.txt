 
MACPM Letter of Support for LD1964:  An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program 
 
 
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, an honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, 
 
The Maine Association of Certified Professional Midwives is testifying in support of paid family 
and medical leave for Maine.  
 
As an organization of care providers who work closely with birthing people, we see the direct 
impact a lack of paid family and medical leave has on Maine families. We know, both from 
personal experience and also from research, that having paid and supported time off for both 
the birthing person and their partner, leads to better health outcomes for the birthing person and 
the newborn. This includes lower incidence of postpartum mood disorders, higher rates of 
breastfeeding and lower likelihood of exposure to infectious diseases for the newborn.  
 
With the passage of LD1964 Maine families would benefit from increased support and lower 
stress levels in the postpartum period.  
 
We hope you will support LD1964. Thank you for listening to our perspective. We are happy to 
answer any questions you may have and can be reached at contactmacpm@gmail.com .  
 
Sincerely,  
The MACPM Board
