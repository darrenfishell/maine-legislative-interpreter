LD 1964
We, Calais and Orono IGA's are opposed to LD 1964, the proposed Paid Family 
Medical Leave Medical Program, period.  We have our own systems to help 
employees if they are out.  We are continuously squeezed with higher utility costs, 
insurance costs, minimum wage increases, plastic bag bans, foam tray bans....the list 
goes on.  At what point will it not be worth even being in business?  That day is 
coming as retailers are being pushed out with all these increases.  Why are we the 
targets to compensate for increases that we have no control over?  We are forced to 
pay higher wages but landlords aren't forced to lower their rents, gas stations are not 
forced to lower their gas prices, insurance is not forced to lower their premiums, and 
manufacturers are not forced to lower their cost of goods.  Instead, solve everything 
by forcing business owners to pay more out of pocket costs to help people pay for all 
the increases?  It's not right. 
We are 100% against the minimum wage increase and 100% against this Paid Family 
Medical Leave.  If the state wants to pay people to be out of work, then they should 
utilize the unemployment system that is already in place instead of making us pay.  
Thank you for your time.
