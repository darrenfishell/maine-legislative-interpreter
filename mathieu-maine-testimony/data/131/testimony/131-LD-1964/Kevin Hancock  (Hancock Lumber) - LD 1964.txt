LD 1964
Hello!  
My three biggest concerns with LD 1964 are…
 
#1. The state creating bureaucracy & capacity to administer the finances (collect and 
disperse the money).  When you think about it, it’s very inefficient for all the funding 
to come from our employees and our company and then get sent to Augusta to then 
get sent back to the employees.  I don’t so much mind the concept of the leave but 
rather the state’s interference in administering it.
 
#2.  This act takes Hancock Lumber (and all companies) beyond being responsible for
managing leave in a great way for our employees and makes us financially 
responsibly for all companies and all employees.  The companies and employees that 
do the best job with the program will then be subsidizing and paying for those that do 
the worst job.  
 
#3.  It’s inflationary.  This will further increase the cost of labor which will then 
further increase the cost of everything.
Thank you!
