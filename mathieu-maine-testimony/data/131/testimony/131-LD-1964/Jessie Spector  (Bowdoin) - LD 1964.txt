LD 1964
Dear members of the committee. 
My name is Jessie, and I live in Bowdoin. I am writing today to ask you to support  
LD 1964 - An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to 
Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program. 
As the mother of a three year old, it is ONLY because I am one of the lucky ones who
already had paid leave (from an out-of-state remote job) that I and my spouse did not 
have to drop out of the workforce altogether to care for our child. We were each able 
to take sufficient leave from our jobs to care for our infant and then return to work 
once she was of an age that she could attend school. I know countless people who 
have had to drop out of the workforce to care for children, parents, or other loved 
ones - resulting in impoverishment, loss of quality workers, and worse. Simply giving
people the time they need to care for loved ones in the short-term, enables all of us to 
have a stronger and more secure workforce - and thus economy - in the long term. 
Please support  LD 1964. 
Thank you for your time.
