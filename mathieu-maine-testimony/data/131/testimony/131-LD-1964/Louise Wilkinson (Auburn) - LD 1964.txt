This would be a significant burden to our business, which is seasonal in it's 
manufacturing.  We are a small company and having an individual out on this type of 
long of leave would be 50% of their total employment time with us in a typical year.  
Our positions are all integrated, this will likely create shutdowns on a regular basis 
that would not be sustainable. Replacing just one person on a temporary basis while 
they are on leave is difficult.  Who is going to fill all of these gaps as we are already 
struggling with a worker shortage?
Also, most of our employees can simply not afford to pay this additional tax on their 
income. They are hard working individuals who should not have to pay more in 
income taxes. As far as the the company paying the additional tax, we would likely 
have to increase health insurance deductibles or reduce benefits to pay for this tax.
