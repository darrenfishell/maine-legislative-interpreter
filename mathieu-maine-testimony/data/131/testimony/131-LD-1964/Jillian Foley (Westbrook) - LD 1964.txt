Dear Senator Tipping, Representa�ve Roeder, and honorable members of the Commitee,  
 My name is Jillian Foley  and I live in Westbrook, ME . I am submi�ng this tes�mony today in support of paid family and 
medical leave for Maine.  
As a mom of three young children, this issue is very personal to me. I was lucky with my ﬁrst born to have a job where I 
received paid leave for 12 weeks.  My husband did not receive any leave and took a total of 2 weeks oﬀ unpaid to help. 
He has always felt he missed out on the early days and was not able to support me in my recovery. I also have 6 -month -
old twins. This �me around I was not lucky enough to have paid leave. My twins were born 5 weeks early and spent 3 
weeks in the NICU. My husband and I chose to take money out of savings and go into credit card debt to  stay home with 
them longer. He took 6 weeks unpaid. I took 17 weeks. NICU parents and parents of mul�ples have very litle choice in 
going back to work even if they want to. The demands of NICU stays and the amount of care required for newborn twins 
requires is hard to imagine un�l you experience it. It is even more complicated when you have older children. Paid leave would have been extremely helpful and made this �me much easier. I hope that in the future other Maine families will have this op�on.  
I also hold a Master’s degree in Public Policy and I can tell you that this is not only a parent’s issue, but this is an equity issue. The majority of care work is done by women and women are the ones losing out on pay when they need to take 
family leave. This is also sound economic policy and a public health mater. All of the research about paid leave points to 
the fact that it is shown to improve outcomes  such as the  health and wellbeing for both mothers and their babies in the 
short and long term. It not only improves maternal mental health, but it also impacts success rates of breas�eeding , 
which also suﬀers when mom’s return to work too early.  In addi�on, parental leave for non -birthing partners allows for a 
more equal distribu�on of child rearing care and responsibili�es. In the case of mul�ples, or parents with older siblings,  
dual parent leave is essen�al. However, not every family has the privilege to take unpaid leave and no parent should have 
to make these tough choices.  
Furthermore, this bill would also beneﬁt any Maine worker who needs to take family or medical leave, not just parents. Those who may need to care for aging parents, or those who need a medical procedure can do so without losing income. The opposi�on is concerned about the funding, but this bill outlines a clear plan for funding this program with minimal burden on employers and employees.  
This is one of the most important bills to support Maine’s families and it will have  a huge impact on the long -term 
stability of our communi�es. For these reasons, I ask that you vote in support of LD 1964. Thank you.  
 
Sincerely,  
Jillian Foley
