Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the 
Committee:
My name is Karen Foley and I live in Skowhegan. I am submitting this testimony 
today in support of paid family and medical leave for Maine.
I have five grandchildren under the age of five. My daughters are college educated 
women, who waited until their thirties, when they were financially stable, to have 
children. One is employed in the university system, and one runs her own business, 
and yet, I have watched them struggle to find affordable, safe solutions to caring for 
their children. Twelve weeks of leave is simply not enough for a newborn. Neither 
mother nor baby are ready to separate at that point. In the case of two of my 
grandchildren, they were born prematurely, and needed extra care, and going into day 
care right away was a health risk for them. Yet, families need two incomes to survive 
in this economy. Even when they are ready, affordable day care is a luxury, and 
waiting lists are often a year or more. 
It is a given that healthy babies and healthy mothers are essential to a thriving 
community. It is obvious that if families have the ability to take care of their loved 
ones at home, whether itâ€™s a newborn baby or a sick family member, or an elderly 
parent, that we not only have healthier, happier, safer families, but we save 
considerable money in the long run. 
For these reasons, I ask that you vote in support of LD 1964. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Karen M. Foley
