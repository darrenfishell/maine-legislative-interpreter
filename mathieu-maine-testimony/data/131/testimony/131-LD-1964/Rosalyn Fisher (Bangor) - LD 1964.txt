Testimony in Suppport of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of 
the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing
My Name is Rosalyn Fisher and I live  in Bangor.  I am writing in support of Paid 
Family and Medical Leave for Maine.
I am a retired occupational therapist with experience working with infants who were 
born prematuraly and required long stays in Neonatal Intensive Care Units.  Parents 
of these infrants lost wages and sometimes jobs due to a lack of support for them 
while they attended to the needs of their infants.  Currently, 77@ of Maine workers 
do not have paid leave. 
Caring for a family member who is elderly or recuperating from an injury  or surgery 
would also be covered by the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program.
Health insurance may cover medical bills for a worker, but does not pay for lost 
wages that would be supported in LD1964.
Therefore, I urge you to support LD 1964 for Maine workers who  do not have paid 
family and medical leave through their employers.
