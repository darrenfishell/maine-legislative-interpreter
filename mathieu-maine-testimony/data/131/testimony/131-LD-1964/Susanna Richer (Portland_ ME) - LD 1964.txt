LD 1964
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and esteemed members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee, just a short note to encourage you to vote IN SUPPORT of LD 
1964.
Creating a system that requires paid family leave can only benefit us all.  Maine has a 
rapidly aging population (present company included).  
When family cannot take time off to care for loved ones causes stress for everyone 
involved – the person who needs the care, the family member responsible for 
providing care and an employer who is receiving a sub-par effort from an employee 
because the worker’s attention is divided between work and a family crisis.
Maine is such a community-focused states, which is why I have moved back here 
twice! We really try to support each other.  Please make it possible for families to 
support their own by passing L.D. 1964.
Thank you for your consideration.
