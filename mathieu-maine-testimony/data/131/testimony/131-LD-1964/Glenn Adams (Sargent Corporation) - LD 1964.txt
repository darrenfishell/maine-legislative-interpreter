 “An Act to Implement the Recommendations of  the Commission to Develop a Paid Family 
and Medical Leave Benefits Program” 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, a nd members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor and Housing, my name is Glenn Adams, and I am a resident of Oakland. I am the 
Business Development Director and an employee -owner at Sargent Corporation, and I am 
submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 1964.   Sargent Corporation has a long history of buildin g Maine, beginning nearly 100 years ago in the 
small town of Alton. This mont h we achieved a significant milest one, celebrating 10 years as a 
100% employee-owned company. Our more than 440 employees work in seven states along the 
east coast, and over 325 are fortuna te enough to call Maine home.  
 There are many concerns that we have with this  proposed legislation. Be sides creating a new tax 
that puts an unnecessary addi tional financial burden on the co mpany and our employees, we 
worry about the potential misuse of the program and the expansive definition of family members 
that is highly subjective.  Our project staffing is 100% crew  based, meaning that if one cr ew member fails to show up as 
planned, it affects the production on that specific project. With the workforce shortage where it 
currently is, replacing those indivi duals that should choos e to utilize this program in a dishonest 
fashion could also lead to safety issues re sulting from overworked a nd overstressed employees 
that choose to be at work.  This proposed legislation would further weaken Main e’s already low economic and demographic 
rankings in the U.S. and cause many businesses to  pass the increased cost s resulting from this 
proposed legislation onto the consumers.  I am asking you to vote “ought  not to pass” on LD 1964.
