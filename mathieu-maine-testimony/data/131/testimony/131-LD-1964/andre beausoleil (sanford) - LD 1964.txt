LD1964 
I am writing today simply to say that we 
don’t need this new law, this would 
increase taxes on business that are 
already struggling the fix for family leave 
is very simple. 
All you have to do is change the rules on 
the disability and add it there it’s a win 
win and nobody get hurt the insurance 
will cover it 
 
 
Thank you
