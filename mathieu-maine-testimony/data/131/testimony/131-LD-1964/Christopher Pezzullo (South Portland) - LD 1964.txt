My name is Christopher Pezzullo, and I am a pediatrician who lives in South Portland, Maine. I write 
today in support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to 
Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program. 
 
As a pediatrician, I am continually dismayed at the short time period new moms and dads have with 
their newborn babies. As a concerned clinician, I know that the bond formed between a baby and 
its parents is forged in the first year of life. The stress and separation for child and parents that 
comes from early parental return to work is one that Maine should be able to assist with. I am 
amazed that those parents fortunate enough to work locally for TD BankNorth—a Canadian 
company—are able to have 3 months paid leave and an additional 3 months unpaid—because that 
is how Canada takes care of its citizens. We can do better! These young families are the future of 
our country. We must stop being so short-sighted and look to improving our future! 
 
Here are some facts I’ve gleaned about this issue:  
• 25% of new moms return to work in the first postpartum month 
• Mainers live in overwhelmingly rural situations and have an even more acute need for paid 
leave as they have longer waits and must travel further distances for their care 
• Nearby states have instituted paid leave; their small businesses support it, and furthermore 
will attract new individuals to our state 
 
As a trauma informed pediatrician, I know this law could assist in reducing the overwhelming stress 
for young families, thereby reducing the potential and future trauma for children in our state. 
 
I urge the committee to support LD 1964. Thank you for your time and consideration on this 
important issue. I would be happy to discuss this with you further.
