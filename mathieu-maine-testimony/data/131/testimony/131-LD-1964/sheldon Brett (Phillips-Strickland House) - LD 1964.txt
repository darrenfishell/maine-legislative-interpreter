To whom it may concern 
  
 I am writing you as the Administrator of Phillips Strickland House, a non-profit assisted living 
facility located in Bangor Maine. I have read that the legislature is proposing to enact policy LD 1964, 
which amongst other things includes passing paid FMLA for all workers funded through increased payroll 
taxes for businesses and for employees.  
 I wish to express, on behalf of Phillips-Strickland House, the concern we have regarding this 
policy and the ramifications for our business if passed. We are a relatively small non-profit organization 
that operates on a very thin budget because we rely on State funding for the services we provide. The 
increase in payroll taxes alone would cut over $20K from our revenue stream, which we cannot at this 
point afford. This would further jeopardize our ability to remain in business and provide needed 
assistance to our low-income seniors. Secondly, and just as important, this could have devastating 
effects on our ability to maintain state mandated staffing ratios. Much like many industries in our area 
finding and keeping staff has been a challenge. We are just now attaining adequate staff post pandemic, 
as many people seem to be coming back to work after a period of remaining home. To reintroduce a 
means for people to stay at home and receive income will be crippling to industries already having to 
work with minimum support. In addition, the wording of the bill using someone with “significant 
personal bond” is very expansive and ambiguous making it possible for someone to claim FMLA under 
false pretenses.  
 I am asking you to consider the long and short-term effects on small and medium businesses 
with in the state of Maine prior to passing such a policy. I would hate to see more businesses fail due to 
higher taxes and more labor shortages.  
 
 
       Sincerely
