As a new mom, a working mom, it is so essential that this bill is passed here in Maine.
I moved here from the Netherlands and paid leave is 20 weeks over there, which is 
modest compared to other European countries, but this bill is a great step into the 
right direction for Maine. Families should receive the space to recover, bond, and be 
together for these first weeks of life. A good start together is so crucial. Even if you 
have an uncomplicated birth, it still takes all of your focus and energy to get through 
the sleepless first weeks and get to know your new baby. To have to stress and worry 
about your job and your income is simply inhumane. We deserve better.
