I am writing to show my support for LD 1964  - An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave 
Benefits Program. As a parent and physician, I know first hand how important family 
leave can be to individuals. Too often are people forced to choose between caring for 
their loved ones or returning to the work force. Enacting family leave in Maine will 
help individuals make the choice to help and care for those around them when needed.
As a parent, I know firsthand how important family leave can be. The first year of 
transition into parenthood, whatever form that may be, is a critical time for 
development.  By affording parents the ability to stay home with their children, we 
are helping to foster that bond and development. Paid family leave will help Maine's 
families thrive.
