Maine Commercial Tire, Inc.
LD 1964
Maine Commercial Tire has been in business for over thirty years and we have been a
100% Employee Owned company for 7 years and we feel LD 1964 is not good for 
employees. Each employee will be taxed more, those not on leave will be asked to do 
more in an already understaffed environment. Companies with only 16 or 17 
employees could be terminated to stay under the 15 mark. Companies will have 
working capital diverted to paying even more tax and will struggle to improve their 
company. Maine is already at the bottom of the barrel compared to all other states; 
there should be a comprehensive study of  Maine's standing compared to other states 
and goals and limits should be made to make Maine more competitive. This LD is 
effectively a wealth transfer from working people who do not claim family leave to 
those who do. There is a cost with no offsetting benefit to workers who do not claim 
leave. And finally, to not include businesses with 15 or less people is wrong; think of 
all the lawyers, doctors, accountants, investment firms that have small staffs but are 
high earners, makes no sense for them to be excluded if they are to benefit from this. 
Our company needs less regulations and less tax if you expect us to survive.
