LD 1964
 My name is Terri Crocker I am a small business owner of a childcare center located 
in Bath I am writing in support of LD1964 Paid Family and Medical Leave would be 
a huge win in my business in childcare you have Maine State Licensing requirements 
with ratios and background checks health and safety trainings that are required before 
first day of employment if there is an emergency and staff or god forbid myself is out 
for a period of time I either close classrooms or go without pay our small businesses 
can't compete with larger businesses we can't keep our staff we don't have the 
availability to offer benefits I see so many families working and trying to grow there 
family and suffering to make it happen moms trying to get back to there jobs after a 
few weeks of having a baby because they have no pay but then realize they can't have 
childcare until the child is 6weeks old so then families struggle more we need our 
employees healthy which keeps our businesses healthy and then helps keep our 
economy healthy small businesses are what run our communities its us  and the 
people and families we serve please remember that if we can't compete with the larger
businesses we won't retain the staff needed to stay afloat we will continue to sink 
and to all the small businesses that are worried about employees being out think about
the fact that it could be your family and this could be the one benefit that allows you 
to hire staff to take your place while allowing you to stay financially stable to take 
care of your family and keep your business healthy and running All of  Maine 
Workforce needs pfml it needs to be an option
