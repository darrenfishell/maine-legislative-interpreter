Testimony In Support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program

Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing,
My name is Raina Overskride and I live in Lewiston. I am testifying in support of 
paid family and medical leave for Maine.
In 2020 my stepfather had gastral complications and had to miss work for a few 
weeks to recover. During this period we fell behind on our bills and our pantry and 
fridge became scarce with food. To say this was a difficult time would be an 
understatement. We had to rely on food banks most of the time. The food banks did 
not have much to give and we were lucky my partner was able to send some money 
for food. It took close to a year to attain the stability we had before my stepfather 
missed work due to illness.   
Many in our situation go hungry or worse lose their housing and face further crisis 
creating a spiral into suffering and homelessness thus facing violence and even death. 
With the lack of safety nets like Paid Medical and Family Leave many suffer. The 
suffering can easily be avoided with a bill like LD 1964.   
If my stepfather had Paid Medical and Family Leave in 2020 we would have been 
able to be food secure and stay ahead of our bills. We would have been at ease 
knowing where our next meal was coming from, that our bills were paid, and that we 
had housing stability. There are people like my stepfather all over this state with 
similar or worse situations who need this bill.
I urge all of you to support LD 1964
Please do the right thing for the working-class people of Maine.
Thank you for taking a look at my testimony
Sincerely,
Raina Overskride
