Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and distinguished members of the  Joint Standing  
Committee on Labor and Housing , my name is Joe Anderson.  I am a reside nt of Portland, a 
hospital -based pediatrician in Lewiston, and I s it on the Board of the Maine C hapter of the 
American Academy of P ediatrics.  Dr. Laura B laisdell  has submitted testimony on beh alf of the 
Maine AAP in support of LD 1964: An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a P aid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.  I would like to 
voice m y strong personal  support  as well and  urge you to vote ou ght to pass to establish this 
important and valuable program . As both a dedicated pediatrician and a prospe ctive adoptive 
parent, I hope to  convey  the pressing need for such a program to ensure the well -being of 
families during critical life events.  
As a pediatrician, I have had the privilege of caring for numerous families throughout my career. 
Time  and time again, I have witnessed the challenges faced by parents who are forced to make 
difficult choices between providing necessary care for their children and maintaining financial 
stability. The absence of a paid family medical leave program puts fami lies in an untenable 
position, often leading to prolonged separations during crucial moments of a child's life.  
The first few months of a child's life are of utmost importance for their development, and the 
presence of a nurturing caregiver during this pe riod greatly influences their future well -being. 
However, without a paid family medical leave program, many parents are forced to return to 
work shortly after their child is born, resulting in increased stress and decreased bonding 
opportunities. This not only affects the parent -child relationship but also hampers the child's 
overall health and development.  
Furthermore, as a prospective adoptive parent, I have an acute understanding of the  significant 
financial burdens and emotional st ress many families experience  due to the lack of paid leave 
options. Adoption is a beautiful yet complex journey that demands time, patience, and emotional 
stability. The absence of a comprehensive paid family medical leave program forces adoptive 
parents to navigate the adoption process while juggling work responsibilities, often to the 
detriment of their well -being and that of the child they are bringing into their family.   As a 
physician, I have the resources available to be able t o take unpaid time off when we are lucky 
enough to bring home our future child, but this is not a reali ty for most families.  
Studies have consistently shown that paid family medical leave prog rams lead to positive 
outcomes for both parents and children. It promotes healthier families, increases employee

satisfaction and productivity, and reduces the need for costly public assistance programs. By 
implementing such a program, Maine would join a g rowing number of forward -thinking states 
that prioritize the well -being of families and recognize the fundamental importance of nurturing 
caregivers during critical life events.  
I urge you to support the proposed legislation for a paid family medical leav e program in Maine. 
By doing so, you will be championing the well -being of families, ensuring a brighter future for 
our children, and strengthening the fabric of our communities. I believe that this program aligns 
with our shared values of compassion, fair ness, and the recognition that investing in families is 
an investment in our collective future.  
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I have faith in your leadership and commitment to 
making a positive difference in the lives of Maine's families. P lease feel free to reach out to me if 
you have any questions or if I can provide further information to support the passage of this 
crucial legislation.  
With warm regards ,
