Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program

Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Meredith Torrey and I live in Holden. I am testifying in support of paid 
family and medical leave for Maine. 
I recently had a son, he just turned one on the 21st of May. His name is Marshall. I 
was able to spend three short months with him at home before I had to return to work.
10 out of the 12 weeks were unpaid. I have missed some of my son’s first milestones 
because I was not able to stay home with him due to unpaid leave. Marshall’s father? 
He got 6 days total. Our son needed us more; babies need love and connection.
Studies have shown that mothers should stay home with their babies for three years to
promote bonding, safety, and health. The United States falls greatly behind every 
other developed country in this aspect. It’s time we catch up to build a healthier state 
and nation for all!
More Maine children would grow up in healthy, loving, safe homes. Maine has the 
highest instance of child abuse and neglect in the nation; implementing a paid family 
leave would directly impact all Maine families and children to make a more thriving 
state. 
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, I’m happy to answer any 
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Meredith Torrey
