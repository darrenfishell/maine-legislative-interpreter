 Senator Mike Tipping , Representa�ve Amy Roeder , and dis�nguished members of the 
Commitee on Labor and Housing:  
 
My name is Anne Gass . I’m a resident of Gray, Maine  and I write to urge your support for  LD 
1964, An Act to Implement the Recommenda�ons of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family 
and Medical Leave Beneﬁts Program.  
I am a small business owner and an appointed member of Maine ’s Permanent Commission on 
the Status of Women  (PCSW). The PCSW has tes�ﬁed in favor of this bill; my tes�mony 
represents my own views, however.  
According to the Bureau of Labor Sta�s�cs, more than half (54.9%) of Maine women par�cipate 
in the labo r force . Studies show  that women also spend far more � me caring for loved ones, 
whether it ’s their young children, family members with disabili�es, or aging parents. Simply put, 
both our families and our economy are heavily  dependent on women .  
There are �m es when a loved one ’s need for care requires women to step aside from  work. 
However, with the soaring cost of housing, medical care, transporta�on  and rela ted cost s, 
women a nd their families are caught in a ﬁnancial bind. Medical emergencies may require them 
to leave work, but they cannot aﬀord to do so. The stress th is inﬂicts o n families is incalculable.  
In addi�on, since women are more likely to work part -�me  or to leave  the workforce  en�re ly in 
order to care for family members, they are  hit doubly hard. They earn less money to cover their 
household expenses, and they pay less into Social Secu rity or into some other savings 
mechanism  to cover their re�rement. As  women are more likely to live longer than men, they 
are le� with less money to f und their re�rement;  in large part due to their taking on a larger 
share of uncompensated family care .  
I have a sister whose  adult son has a complex array of cogni� ve and physical impairments. She 
works a demanding , more than  full-�me job  and at the same �me has full responsibility for 
managing  her son ’s care , including his health car e, Social Sec urity  Disability, and Medicare . Last 
winter he had two serious health cris es that  almost  ended his life. Both �mes he was 
hospi talized for a week  and s he was forced to use her paid leave (vaca�on and sick) �me in 
order to respond to these emergencies. She was fortunate to have accrued enough �me to do 
that, but she essen�ally used up all of her leave in doin g so. If  her son  had had another medical 
emergency right on the he els of the other s, or if his medical emergencies had lasted longer , she 
would have been force d to take unpaid leave in order to care for him , making it diﬃcult to meet 
her personal  ﬁnancial obliga�ons.  
My nephew ’s care needs create  ongoing and unrelen�ng  dem ands on my sister, and on other 
families just like hers. I can ’t express to you how diﬃcult it is to wa tch her struggle with this 
enormous res ponsibility, with litle relief . She can ’t aﬀord to take vaca�ons in part because  she 
has to reserve as much paid �me oﬀ as possible for her son ’s next medical emergency. While my 
2 
 sister doesn ’t live in Maine, I know there  are thousands of families in Maine with stories very 
similar to hers.  
LD 19 64 comes out of the recommenda�ons of a commission convened by the legislature to 
study this issue. As it is funded by par�cipa�ng employees and businesses it will not cost Maine 
taxpayers, and it is ﬂe xible enough to cover Maine ’s larger corpora�ons as well as small 
businesse s like mine.  
Thos e of us who are currently  healthy and able , and have healthy families,  canno t count on this 
being true  forever . At some point  we, or someone in our families , will need care. LD 1964 will 
create a system that will help oﬀset some of the ﬁnancial costs of providing care to loved ones. I 
urge you to  support LD 196 4.
