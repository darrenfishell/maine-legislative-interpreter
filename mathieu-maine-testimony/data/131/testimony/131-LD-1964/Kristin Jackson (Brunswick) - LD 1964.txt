LD 1964
My name is Kristin Jackson, I'm a Brunswick resident, and I'm submitting testimony 
in strong support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.
In 2021, I gave birth to my first child. I was lucky enough to have 12 weeks of 
parental leave from my employer, and my husband was given 4 weeks of half-paid 
leave to take with me. And that leave was incredibly critical. For the first two weeks 
of my child's life we had feeding issues, and every 3 hours around the clock we had to
do a feeding regimen that took an hour with both of us involved. This meant never 
sleeping for more than an hour at a time if we were lucky. If either of us had had to 
work it simply wouldn't have been possible - we were barely functioning. If I had had 
to return to work, I would have quit. 
And regardless of issues, a baby is meant to be with its parents. We don't allow 
puppies to be separated from their mothers until they're at least 8 weeks old, but we 
don't give the same decency for our community members. Young babies are also 
incredibly fragile. My daughter got a stomach bug from daycare when she was five 
months old, and because she was so young and it hit her so hard, we had to take her to
the ER for dehydration. Had she been older and sturdier, that likely would not have 
been the case. 
Additionally, our state is facing a childcare crisis. I've had multiple friends leave the 
workforce because they can't find childcare for their children. We got our daughter 
into one daycare, but have been on other waitlists for over a year and a half. If each 
parent gets 12 weeks of leave, there's more time to find the childcare you need to go 
back to work. 
Thank you for your time, and please do the right thing for Maine families and pass 
LD 1964.
