I’m contacting you in opposition to LD 1964, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave 
Benefits Program.
Employment compensation is between the employer and the employee, not an 
increasingly intrusive and socialist government. In a competitive free market society 
employers offer benefits to attract and retain good employees. Just because some 
employers don’t, that doesn’t mean it’s on the rest of us to make up for their 
shortcomings. Employees, by law, are already allowed twelve weeks off for unpaid 
family leave and medical leave. Now, you want to take more money from the people, 
and dole it out as you sit fit to pay for it. How much of that money will be used to 
create new government jobs, government jobs that have benefits much better than 
most people? How much of that money will be wasted on administration fees?
Employers are not the nannies of their employees, and the government is not the 
nanny of the people. What we get out of life is up to the individual, not our employers
and certainly not our government. Your intentions may be good, but the consequences
will inevitably be bad.
Remember this, when the cost of hiring a worker rises, demand for that worker falls. 
Mandated paid family and medical leave is a terrible idea and I urge the committee to 
vote “Ought Not To Pass.”
