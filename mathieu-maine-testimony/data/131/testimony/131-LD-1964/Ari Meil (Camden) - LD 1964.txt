Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Ari Meil and i live in Camden. l'm testifying in support of LD 1964, in favor of paid 
leave for Maine's workers. I am part owner of Naretiv, a design ﬁrm which employs four people 
in Maine. My employees are the absolute core of my business. Their health and well-being has 
an enormous impact on my bottom line every day. 
Paid family leave is important to me and my employees for so many reasons. The most 
important is the peace of mind knowing that during a signiﬁcant event we can safely and 
without worry take the time we need, whether it is an emergency, or a meaningful milestone in 
our or our family's lives. Butjust as important to me as a business owner is the mental and 
physical health of my staff. I need to be able to count on them giving me their best work. And 
they can only do that when they are able to take the time they need to focus on themselves and 
their families. 
At Naretiv, we feel so strongly about the importance of paid leave, that we have an unlimited 
paid time off policy for all employees. Never once has anyone abused the privilege. But 
everyday I reap the beneﬁts of a staff that is dedicated and passionate about our company. My 
staff feel respected and cared for, they stick around, and they go above and beyond on a daily 
basis. Every business owner in Maine, no matter how small, should be able to reap these 
beneﬁts, and LD 1964 would help them do so. 
l am very sensitive to the fact that not everyone could implement a policy like ours. Which is 
why this bill is so important. I know that paid time off for Maine's workers will translate intoa 
happier more productive and dedicated work force. 
Thank you, and l urge you to support LD 1964. 
Ari Meil
