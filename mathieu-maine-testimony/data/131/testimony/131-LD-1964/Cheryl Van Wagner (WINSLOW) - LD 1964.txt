LD 1964 
Small business are already trying to survive with a devastated work force in Maine.  If this LD 1964 is 
passed this could potentially shut down those businesses barely hanging on after the Covid 19 crisis.  
The production lost to workers on leave will indirectly create more workplace injuries and costly 
mistakes by meeting deadlines and haphazard mistakes rejecting safety protocols and standards. Our 
employees’ jobs are protected by the current Family Medical Leave Act – WE CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY 
EMPLOYEES TO STAY HOME.  Restaurants, small convenience stores, salons and many more will be 
trying to stay under the 15-employee mark therefore reducing the workforce ever further. 
Health Care costs are at an all-time high and rising this bill could potentially eliminate short term 
disability in the State of Maine and have an enormous effect on long term disability for employees.  
With this the employers will lose the credit associated with bundling these insurances which will pass 
more cost on to the employees.  Not to mention the employees that will be affected in various 
insurance agencies throughout the State.  In addition, it reduces private employers’ ability to attract 
talent with competitive benefit packages.    
 
With the current way the LD reads an employee can start receiving 10 weeks of compensation after 6 
weeks of employment this tells us the LD 1964 is not sustainable.  This is an attractive way for people to 
stay home instead of earning their income and boosting the economy.
