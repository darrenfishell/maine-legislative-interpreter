When my second child was born I was entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per the 
FMLA, and through my employer was offered short term disability: 6 weeks of half 
time pay to recover from birth, relearn to breastfeed, and bond with my new baby. 
Because my employer did not offer a fully paid leave, and they continued to deduct 
the cost of my health insurance from a paycheck I wasn’t receiving, I ended up owing 
my employer nearly $1000 when I returned from giving birth. This was a crushing 
financial blow to our family which I wasn’t prepared for because it wasn't 
communicated to me before I left to have my baby.
This experience left me feeling betrayed and humiliated by my employer, and I ended 
up leaving this job not long after.
In Maine it is illegal to separate a puppy from its mother before 7 weeks, but no such 
protections are in place for human babies. As many as 1 in 4 American mothers must 
return to work 10 days after giving birth which puts them and their babies at higher 
risk for physical and mental health complications. 
If we claim to care about families, it is time we catch up with the rest of the developed
world and offer humane structures of support for parents and children. Please reach 
out to your local legislator, or have a chat with the person collecting signatures on 
election day to learn more.
