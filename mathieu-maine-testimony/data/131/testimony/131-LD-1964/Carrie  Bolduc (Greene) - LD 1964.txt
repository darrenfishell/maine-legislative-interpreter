LD 1964
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing,
My name is Carrie Bolduc.  I am a resident of Greene, Maine and I have worked as a 
Human Resources Professional for twenty years.  I have personally experienced being
forced to return to work 10 days after the birth of my first child due to lack of 
resources and financial inability to support my newborn.  This impacted my ability to 
fully recover from a traumatic labor and took valuable opportunity to care for and 
bond with my infant.  
As a human resources professional, I have worked to create company policies that 
would support new parents as well as older employees who needed time to care for 
their parents or adult disabled children.  According to the MDOL Report - 
Demographics of Maine's Workforce, 11/30/2021, the average weekly wage in Maine
is $1,005, women are more likely to work part time, and as we have known for 
several years, there are not enough new Mainers to fill the jobs of those aging out of 
the workforce.  Combine that with people leaving the state for better opportunities, 
our workforce is in poor shape.  
The policies that businesses have developed to support their employees when they 
need to care for family or their own medical needs have led to higher retention rates, 
increased morale, and overall improvement to employee wellbeing.  For employees, 
this has provided economic security, improved health outcomes, and supported career 
development.  
I believe from personal and professional experience that this bill will benefit both 
employers and employees in Maine.  In Maine, we take care of each other.  This is 
bill is the right thing to do. I hope you will support LD 1964.
