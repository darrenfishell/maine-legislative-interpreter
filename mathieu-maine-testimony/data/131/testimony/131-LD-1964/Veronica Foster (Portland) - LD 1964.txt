The ability to take parental leave after the birth of my daughter in 2022 was essential, 
but also the product of a number of privileges not all Mainers share. I was eligible for 
FMLA, had built up sick time that I could use for maternity leave, and had a spouse 
whose job was able to support us during the weeks of my leave that were unpaid. 
Without these privileges, I might have been back at work within a matter of weeks, 
like so many postpartum parents. I would likely have missed out on having the 
feeding support I needed when breastfeeding was challenging, missed out on the 
therapy I needed to combat postpartum depression, and missed out on those glorious, 
impossible first months with my first child. I remember turning to my husband on the 
day my daughter turned 6 weeks old and asking, "Can you believe there are people 
having to go back to work right now?" The idea was horrifying. I urge this committee 
to develop a paid leave program to ensure that both new mothers and our youngest 
Mainers have the love and structure they need to thrive in the tenuous and challenging
weeks after birth.
