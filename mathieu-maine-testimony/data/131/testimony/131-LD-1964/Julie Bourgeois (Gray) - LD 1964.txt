LD 1964
My name is Julie Bourgeois and I'm from Gray, Maine. I write today in support of LD
1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a 
Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.
 
I recently had to take an extended leave to care for my father during his final stages 
with Parkinson's disease. Caring for my dad was the most fulfilling thing I have ever 
done in my life, but it was also the most challenging.  I was able to take advantage of 
a week-long paid leave program offered by my employer, and I was also incredibly 
lucky to be in an financial position to afford taking 2 additional weeks off, unpaid. I'm
so grateful that I did not have to choose between my family and my work, but 
unfortunately my situation is not the norm. Most Mainers are forced to choose - do 
they take unpaid leave to care for themselves or their loved ones, or do they continue 
to work to keep up with their finances.  This is a heartbreaking decision, and it's 
completely avoidable if Maine enacts a paid leave program. Workers need to be able 
to take the time off to care for their families without fearing job loss, so itâ€™s important 
to make sure that job protections are a strong part of the bill. Therefore, I ask the 
committee to support LD 1964. Thank you for your time and consideration on this 
important issue.
