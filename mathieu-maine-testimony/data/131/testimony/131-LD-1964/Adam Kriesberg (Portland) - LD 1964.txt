While working in another state, paid family leave was an incredible resource to me 
and my family after the birth of our first child. It is a tangible and urgently needed 
support for new parents who are nurturing new lives and should not have to worry 
about losing their jobs or pay during this transition period. In the wealthiest nation on 
earth we can find a way to support families in the first months after they have a child. 
Maine has the opportunity to be a leader in this trend across the country!
