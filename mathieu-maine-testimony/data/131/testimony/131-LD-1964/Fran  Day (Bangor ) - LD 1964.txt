I support paid family leave for Maine because caregiving is often an unexpected need 
for so many families. Being available to provide care for our loved ones is the right 
thing to do. It’s unfortunate to worry about keeping our job or loosing wages due to a 
family member needing care to stay at home. 
When I was working I needing to take time off to help my father who was dying of 
cancer. He checked out nursing facilities, and decided to stay home as long as he 
could. I was fortunate to have family medical leave so I didn’t worry about loosing 
my job. Being able to help care for my father was the right thing to do.
Please support LD 1964. It would set up a planned program to support family 
members that require support and job security,  if need to become a  caregiver for a 
loved one.. life changes quickly and medical emergencies could occur at unexpected 
time. As an older adult, I hope my children will be able to take time off to help me, if 
needed in the future.  It’s the right thing too do.
