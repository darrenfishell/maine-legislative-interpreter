Testimony in support of LD 1964, "An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission 
to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program." 
James Myall, Economic Policy Analyst 
May 25, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of thejoint Standing Committee 
on Labor and Housing. My name isjames Myall, and l'm an economic policy analyst at the Maine Center 
for Economic Policy. I'm here before you to testify in support of LD 1964, "An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program." LD 
1964 would make our economy and our workforce stronger, and benefit tens of thousands of Mainers 
each year who currently face an impossible choice between a paycheck and caring for themselves ora 
loved one. 
The paid family and medical leave proposal outlined in LD 1964 is in line with similar programs that have 
been enacted in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Many other states are also considering 
implementing programs this year. I think it's important to note that the proposal in LD 1964 is relatively 
modest. For example, Minnesota's governor is poised to sign a paid family and medical leave bill which 
will provide more weeks of leave, and has more robustjob protections than are envisaged in LD 1964.‘ 
Nonetheless, LD 1964 would represent substantial progress for Maine's workers and our economy. 
A state paid family and medical leave program will make our economy fairer and stronger. Currently, 
thousands of Mainers are kept out of the workforce, or are forced to work fewer hours than they would 
like, because of care needs. Currently, almost 85,000 Mainers list a care obligation, their own sickness, or 
a disability, as a reason for not working? While only a portion of these individuals would enter the labor 
force if a paid family and medical leave program were in effect, it gives a sense of the scale of the 
problem. And it's important to know that the duty of care still falls disproportionately on women - who 
are almost six times as likely to be out of work due to child care duties than men, and more than twice as 
likely to be caring for an older relative and out of work? Because both men and women receiving equal 
leave rights under LD 1964, it will help to right this gender imbalance. 
This committee has heard plenty of testimony over the past year about the trouble some employers are 
having in finding workers. LD 1964 is one answer to that problem. Maine actually has more people 
working today than before the pandemic, and one of the highest rates of employment participation in 
our history. ‘ The problem is thatjobs are being created faster than they can be ﬁlled with our current 
workforce. We can address this issue by attracting more people to come to Maine to live and work, and 
we can make it easier for current Mainers to work. LD 1964 will help accomplish both. 
Research has found that implementing a paid family and medical leave program in California and New 
Jersey reduced new mothers’ labor force dropout rates by 20 percent? Other studies show similar 
impacts on people facing the need to care for a sick or injured spouse." Economists have pointed to the

United States’ lack of paid leave policies as a significant part of the reason that women here are not able 
to work as much as women in other developed countries. ’ 
Regarding the overall sustainability of the program, the legislative commission has done a very thorough 
job of assessing the potential costs with the help of a professional actuarial firm. Their estimates are 
similar to my own independent modelling of the potential costs of the program, and are in line with the 
experience of other states. I anticipate that the program design laid out in the sponsors ’ amendment (90 
percent wage replacement up to half of the average weekly wage, and 75 percent above that, toa 
maximum of the average weekly wage) would require a payroll contribution of 0.83 percent. l've included 
examples of how this would work for different kinds of workers in Maine. For the typical worker, the cost 
of the program would be equivalent to a cup of coffee ($3.50) a week. For a business with 25 employees, 
the payroll contributions would be approximately $5,800 a year, or around $230 per employee.

Note: Assumes LD T964 with a sponsor amendment that would create a benefit rate of 90% of a recipient's usual wages up to 
half the statewide average weekly wage, plus 75% of wages above that level, with a total benefit capped at statewide average 
weekly wage. Uses the current SAWW of $ 7,036. Assumed contribution rate is based on each worker having a 70% chance of 
using the program each year and taking an average leave of 44 days (6.3 weeks). The contribution rate includes 0 5% 
administrative overhead and repayment of a $50 million bond for start-up costs. 
For businesses, there are benefits to offset the costs of these payroll contributions. Businesses which 
offer paid family and medical leave report lower turnover rates, improved morale and productivity, and 
better talent attraction. “ That's why most large companies offer this benefit. The advantage of a state 
program as proposed in LD 1964 is that it levels the playing field for small businesses. By sharing the 
costs among the whole state, it allows small businesses to afford a plan that they otherwise could not, 
and allows them to compete with the large companies which are already offering this benefit. A sun/ey of 
New York employers after the implementation of that state's program found that most employers were 
supportive of the new program, and that it made it easier for employers to plan for worker absences - 
likely because workers now gave clearer timelines for how long they would be absent?
Our understanding is that the sponsor's amendment contains a "hardship exemption" for small 
businesses which would absolve them of the need to retain job and benefit protections for workers on 
leave. Maine Center for Economic Policy is very concerned about the potential for this to becomea 
general exclusion for the 114,000 Mainers who work for businesses with fewer than 15 employees. These 
Mainers have been excluded from existing family and medical leave legislation, and currently have no 
right even to unpaid leave. There's no reason they should be disadvantaged once again. 
LD 1964 already exempts small employers from paying any contributions into the fund, and the research 
does not support the idea that a paid family and medical leave program presents a significant "hardship" 
for these employers. And without the guarantee of a return to work or the continuation of benefits 
during the leave period, leave becomes a very difficult prospect for many Mainers, especially people 
without savings to fall back on. 
LD 1964 would provide security for the tens of thousands of working Mainers each year who must take 
time away from work temporarily to welcome a new child, to take care of a loved one, or to recover from 
a serious illness. lt would do so in a thoughtful way, with a program designed to consider the needs of 
workers, businesses, and our economy. As a result, it would not only make workers more secure, but 
strengthen our economy overall. I urge you to vote "ought to pass" on the legislation. 
Thank you. l'll be happy to take any questions.
