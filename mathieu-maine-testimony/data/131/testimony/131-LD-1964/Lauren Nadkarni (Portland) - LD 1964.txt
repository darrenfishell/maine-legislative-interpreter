LD 1964
I strongly support LD 1964 and hope that it will be passed as soon as possible. PFML 
stabilizes the ongoing workforce crisis and prevents young families from leaving the 
state, it mitigates the childcare crisis, it decreases turnover costs for small businesses, 
improves overall health of the population, and most importantly is the right thing to 
do to support new or growing families to support bonding and positive health 
outcomes for new family members. There are many other states in the US with a 
formal PFML policy (such as Massachussetts) and the US is well behind the standards
of other developed nation in terms of supporting PFML. As a physician, this is one of 
the most important supports for new or growing families that can provide long-lasting
benefits to all family members for many years to come. Thank you for your 
consideration.
