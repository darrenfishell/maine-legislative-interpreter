LD 1964
My name is Alex Kai and I am a resident of Woodstock. I am submitting testimony in
support of  LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission 
to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.
Last year my wife needed surgery to fix a chronic hernia problem. She was unable to 
do much around the home for about a month before the actual surgery itself due to her
condition. After the surgery, she was given a six week recovery time, but due to her 
chronic health problems, those six weeks became eight. So for three months my wife 
was completely out of commission and unable to work or care for our young 
daughter.
During this time I was working a fulltime job, in which I had to take several unpaid 
days off to take care of my wife and help care for the kiddo. I am grateful to my job 
for giving me the time off, and not risking my overall employment. Throughout all of 
this, I kept my job and still work there today. But because the days off were unpaid, 
my paychecks couldn't cover the costs of living and we fell behind on bills, and 
struggled to keep food on the table.
Having the Paid Family Medical Leave Act would have been the difference between 
three months of stress, food insecurities, and falling behind on bills, with three 
months of being able to focus on my wife's recovery. Having the ability to take time 
off without worrying about being able to pay bills or put food on the table, would 
have made all the difference to my family during one of the toughest times in recent 
years for us. We need a strong Paid Family and Medical Leave program here in 
Maine so workers like me donâ€™t have to make the difficult choices I did.
Thank you.
