Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Tracey Falla and I live in Cumberland. I am testifying in support of paid 
family and medical leave for Maine. 
My personal story of requiring medical leave involves being T-boned by a drunk 
driver who ran a red light. My high school age daughter and I had concussions, 
whiplash and rib injuries along with bruises and lacerations. I absolutely could not 
work for at least 4 weeks due to my own injuries and I also had to take care of my 
daughter. As the breadwinner of my family it was essential that I had paid leave. 
Quitting my job due to this temporary disability would not have helped my employer, 
family or the community. Through no fault of my own I needed paid time off from 
work and thankfully I was able to receive it. Everyone deserves this coverage.
As an Occupational Therapist I know the power of purposeful and meaningful work. I
also understand accidents happen - we are humans, not robots - and need to be treated 
as such to heal properly.  
I truly believe that what supports and heals our individual workers pays huge 
dividends to a healthy and productive society. We donâ€™t want sick/hurt people coming
to work. We also know this policy would boost women and minority groups the most 
and equity matters. 
I hope you will support LD 1964. 
Sincerely, 
Tracey Falla, Occupational Therapist
