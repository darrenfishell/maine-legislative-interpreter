Dear Labor and Housing Committee members,
I am in strong support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the
Commission to Develop a Paid Family Medical Leave Benefits Program. A PFML 
program is essential to providing adequate support for families after the birth of a 
child or in the event of another family member's illness.
