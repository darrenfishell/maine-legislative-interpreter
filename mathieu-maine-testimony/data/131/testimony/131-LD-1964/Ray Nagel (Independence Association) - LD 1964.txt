Dear Members of the Department of Labor and Housing Committee, 
My name is Ray Nagel.  I am the Executive Director of Independence Association in 
Brunswick, Maine.  I am extremely concerned about the costs associated with this 
bill. I believe Senator Daughtry's intention is honorable, but such a sweeping measure
disproportionately impacts non-profit agencies whose primary form of revenue is 
MaineCare.  If passed as is, this will be an additional $35,000 in non-reimbursable 
expenses.  We already provide a healthy PTO benefit that enables staff to use time off
as they desire. If passed, we will be forced to reduce our PTO accrual to pay for this 
new entitlement.  Similar to the Earned Paid Leave Act, and Portland's minimum 
wage, agencies that rely on State funding are disproportionately hurt the most. Rates 
to serve people with Intellectual Disabilities are already too low to attract staff.  
Please exempt agencies like Independence Association from this law.  
In my heart, I agree with the intent of this bill, but unless DHHS agrees to increase 
rates to meet this increase in cost, my pocketbook cannot afford it.
