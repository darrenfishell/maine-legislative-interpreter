I write in support of paid family and medical leave for the citizens of Maine, speaking
on my own behalf and not as a representative of my employer. My position is 
influenced by my role as a mother, having had two children over the course of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a physician. Fortunately my position did allow me to
have partially paid leave (via short term disability) after two Caesarian section births 
and the subsequent recovery, and my husband's employer similarly afforded him paid 
family leave. Our children benefitted greatly from this - there is clear data supporting 
better childhood (and maternal) health outcomes when parents are able to be at home 
in the early weeks of infancy. However, for so many people including many of my 
patients, there is no resource for paid family or medical leave, and it is not financially 
viable to have time away from work without that benefit in place. I have many, many 
times seen patients make decisions about returning to work when it is not medically 
advisable because they simply have no other choice. There are significant physical 
and emotional health ramifications to these decisions, and there is an increased risk of
medical or psychiatric complication, re-injury, etc. While there is an economic cost to
paid family and medical leave, there are also economic and societal downsides to 
returning to work too quickly, including the need for future missed work or 
withdrawal from the workforce entirely. In particular, the benefits of paid parental 
leave on children, our most vulnerable citizens, is clear, and offering paid family and 
medical leave is an opportunity to help children get a healthy start to life.
