Good
afternoon
Senat or
Tipping,
Repr esentativ e
Roeder ,
and
honor able
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman,
I
liv e
in
Lewist on,
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1964,
“ An
Act
t o
Implement
the
Recommendations
of
the

t o
De v elop

Lik e
many
of
my
f ellow
Mainers,
I
ha v e
experienced
se v er al
occasions
wher e
I
ha v e
needed
t o
tak e
an
extended
amount
of
time
off
fr om
work.
In
my
case,
it
has
mostly
been
due
t o
injuries
and
chr onic
physical
issues
which
limited
my
ability
t o
continue
doing
my
job.
During
these
times,
I
had
t o
go
without
a
pa y check
and
I
struggled
ﬁnancially
in
addition
t o
physically .
I
also
ha v e
family
members
who
ar e
curr ently
going
thr ough
a
t ough
situation
with
their
y oung
daughter ,
who
is
under going
tr eatment
for
cancer .
The y
ha v e
tak en
numer ous
unpaid
lea v es
of
absence
fr om
work
t o
tak e
car e
of
her
medical
needs,
enduring
all
the
ﬁnancial
str ain
that
goes
along
with
that
while
also
r aising
their
two
other
childr en.
Their
friends
and
community
r ecently
or ganiz ed
a
beneﬁt
dinner
and
a
r aﬄe
as
a
fundr aiser
for
them,
but
the y
ar e
just
one
family
out
of
many
acr oss
Maine
who
ﬁnd
themselv es
in
situations
lik e
this.
Maine
also
has
the
oldest
population
of
any
state
in
the
countr y
and
we ’r e
only
getting
older .
As
our
par ents
and
gr andpar ents
continue
t o
age,
the y
ar e
going
t o
r equir e
mor e
car e
fr om
y ounger
family
members,
especially
giv en
the
challenge
that
emplo y ers
ar e
ha ving
ﬁlling
job
openings
for
car egiv ers.
This
bill
will
affor d
people
the
ability
t o
pr o vide
that
necessar y
car e
t o
their
family
without
experiencing
se v er e
