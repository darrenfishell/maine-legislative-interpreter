Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Caitlin Wright and I live in Brunswick. I write today in support of LD 
1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a 
Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program. 
I gave birth last June, and was thankfully able to utilize some paid leave through my 
employer, although the bulk of my time on leave was unpaid. My husband did not 
have any paid or unpaid leave, so the time off he took to care for and bond with our 
son left us without his paycheck. Lack of paid leave was a factor of how long we each
were able to take off to be home with our baby, and created a lot of heartache and a 
stress in an already fragile time. I was not ready to return to work, but felt I had no 
choice. This absolutely was detrimental to my mental health.
I know my story is similarly played out by many Mainers across our stateâ€”LD 1964 
would allow us to write a different ending. Having support in the form of paid leave 
for families will help all of us in the long run, and I believe that is why there is such 
strong support for it from our communities.
If this law is passed, I know if I choose to have another child, my husband and I will 
be able to have room to breathe and focus on what is most important, our children. 
Paid family leave creates healthier families who thrive, in turn creating a healthier, 
stronger Maine.  
I urge the committee to please support LD 1964. Thank you for time and 
consideration on this immensely important issue. 
Sincerely, 
Caitlin Wright
