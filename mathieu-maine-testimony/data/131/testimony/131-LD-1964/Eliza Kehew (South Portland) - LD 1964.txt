Testimony In Support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program

Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Eliza Kehew and I live in South Portland, Maine. I am testifying in 
support of paid family and medical leave for Maine. 
As a mother, a private practice clinician in Maine, and the primary financial provider 
in my household, my family depends on the income brought in by my practice. The 
threat of not being able to take a leave if myself or a member of my family should 
need it has caused me to question leaving the field all together. 
I believe that everyone deserves the right to a safety net. To be able to take care of 
ourselves or our families if we have to, without the threat of losing everything if we 
need to take a leave. Maine residents should feel supported in pursuing their dreams 
of owning independent businesses, and this legislation would greatly support those 
ventures. 
In a time where mental health practitioners are needed more than ever, Maine should 
be taking tangible and proactive steps to support and protect small and independent 
private practice clinicians. Passing LD 1964 would be a step in that direction.
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, Iâ€™m happy to answer any 
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Eliza Kehew
