LD 1964
I am Andrew Stewart of Lisa-Marie’s Made In Maine, Inc.  We have locations in Bath
and Portland.  We employee between 17 and 23 employees depending on the seasonal
changes in store traffic.
I am opposed to passing LD 1964.
Doing business in Maine is expensive already.   Adding a Family Medical Leave Act 
to list the list of expenses will be burden to both employers and employees.  My 
conservative estimate is that the company will have to carry additional costs of more 
than $4,000 annually. 
I also believe that the initial costs are just the start up costs and that, if implemented, 
the program and its administrative bureaucracy will come up with justification to 
expand and cost more over time.
This is happening as we are entering a period of inflation with energy and material 
costs are already biting into the overhead budget.
From the employee’s perspective, I believe that most, given the choice, would rather 
have the money in their pocket than in supporting a state-run insurance 
administration.
The requirement that we hold positions open for 12 weeks will make a difficult 
staffing situation harder to navigate.  For a business of our size, we would be just over
the 15-person threshold.  I can tell you from experience that asking fellow employees 
to fill the void with additional hours while someone is out causes frustration and they 
leave making the absence worse.
Finding employees at every level of the job market is extremely difficult now and it 
doesn't look like there is any improvement in sight.  Employers like us would rather 
have the resources to increase compensation for current and prospective employees.  
In the end it is compensation and work environment that will drive the employees 
decision to sign on or stay with a company. 
Thank you for your time,
Andrew Stewart
