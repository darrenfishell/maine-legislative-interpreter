Testimony In Support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program

Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Christina Correnti and I live in Portland. I am writing today in support of 
paid family and medical leave for Maine. 
When my daughter was born in 2017, I had no paid leave available. I had to choose 
between taking unpaid leave, or returning to work while still recovering from labor 
and delivery. Ultimately I took 11 weeks of unpaid leave from my job, which erased 
much of our family's hard-earned savings. Still, I was luckier than many other parents 
who do not have the financial option of taking any unpaid leave. 
Paid leave would offer parents much-needed time to bond with their newborns, and 
offer birthing parents a chance to recover physically before returning to work. It 
would also make it easier for companies to retain employees who become new 
parents. 
We hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, Iâ€™m happy to answer any
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Christina Correnti
