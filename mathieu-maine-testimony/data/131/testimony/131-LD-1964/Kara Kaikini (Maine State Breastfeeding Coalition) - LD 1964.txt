At-Large Direrlnr In Support of LD 1964: An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program 
May 25, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the ]oint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Kara Kaikini and I live in Freeport. I am here today to speak in support of 
LD 1964 as a Lactation Consultant and as the Executive Director of the Maine State 
Breastfeeding Coalition Q/ISBC). 
Feeding breast milk exclusively for the first six months of life (and continued for2 
years) is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.1 This is based ona 
significant amount of evidence supporting human milk for this amount of time. 
Most mothers want to meet these recommendations. Most don’t make it. Mothers who 
have a lack of maternity leave are less likely to even start breastfeeding due to barriers 
to expressing and collecting their milk in their workplace (Snyder et al, 2018). 
In 2019 86.6% of Maine’s new mothers started breastfeeding. The rate of exclusive 
breastfeeding at 3 months dropped to 50.5% and by 6 months, it was as low as 28.7%.? 
Far from What the AAP recommends. 
So what happens in those early months for the majority of new parents? They havea 
ﬁnancial need to return to work. 
The Maine State Breastfeeding Coalition aims to make it easier for new parents to reach 
their infant feeding goals. But we know that despite better maternity care, and more 
support and education, families are still going to struggle to meet their goals (and the 
recommendations of healthcare organizations) without policy and systems like paid 
family & medical leave. This kind of policy would remove a signiﬁcant barrier and 
Would increase rates of human milk feeding.

One recent study showed that a 1-month increase in the legislated duration of paid maternity leave was associated 
with a 7.4 percent increase of early initiation of breastfeeding, a 5.9 percent increase in exclusive breastfeeding, and 
a 2.2- month increase in breastfeeding duration.-" ’ 
A strong, accessible policy like LD1964 is critical for improving breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and therefore 
the lifelong public health of Maine’s citizens. 
As a result of health beneﬁts associated with breastfeeding, a study on the economics of breastfeeding showed that 
if 90% of infants were breastfed in 2016 then Federal Medicaid costs would have decreased by at least $111.6 
million, resulting in an estimated increase of $140.9 million in combined Federal WIC and Medicaid costs. On the 
other hand, health-related cost savings that accrue to WIC households or their health insurance providers would 
have totaled $9 billion. This is what can happen if families have systems in place that help make exclusive 
breastfeeding a reality for them.4 
Mothers often blame themselves when breastfeeding doesn’t work out despite the fact that they are doing 
everything they can to meet their goals. We need to come together to implement a system of support that will 
reduce some of these external barriers. 
I urge you to support the ﬁnancial, mental and physical health of new parents and their babies by voting for, and 
ﬁzncling, the kind of systemic support LD 1964 would bring. 
Thank you,
