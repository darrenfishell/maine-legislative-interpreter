LD 1964
Senator Mike Tipping and Representative Amy Roeder. My name is Samantha 
Rogers and I am a resident of Wilton. I am here to speak in support of LD 1964, “An 
Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family
and Medical Leave Benefits Program”
My partner and I were living independently when I got pregnant. At the time, neither 
of us had jobs that allowed paid time off. In order to give our starting family the best 
chance, both my partner and I had to make the decision to drastically reduce our 
spending, our bills, our living situation, and more. We moved in with our family - my 
mother - for housing. We had to sacrifice our independence, both physically and 
financially in order to be prepared for our baby.
If our careers had paid leave, we could have remained independent and contributing 
members of society for those three months. However, we were forced to leave our 
community for more affordable living circumstances. We had to find new careers that
could better support our future. Paid Family Medical Leave would have allowed us to 
provide for our family and return to our chosen careers. Additionally, it would have 
prevented our prior and new employers from costly turnover costs.
Mainers deserve to care for themselves, their children, their loved ones, and be 
financially stable. Job security and financial stability keep our economy and Maine 
families thriving, and Paid Family Medical Leave is how we bridge that gap as a 
community. 
Thank you.
