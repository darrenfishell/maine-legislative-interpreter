LD 1964
Dear Committee Members,
I am writing to oppose LD 1964 and urge an “ought not to pass” vote. 
This is burdensome and harmful for small businesses, many of whom are already 
struggling just to scrape by and survive in the current economy. There's a lot of 
nuance to the issues it presents that are being completely ignored.
Imagine that 2 people at a 15-person company are suddenly out for family medical 
leave at the company's busiest time of year. Now the owner is burdened with having 
to hire and train replacements just to get by when there's limited time and resources to
do so, and then what - be forced to terminate them upon return of the original 
employees? Or otherwise, be forced to spread around the same amount of work to 
more people, which upsets employees and leads them to quit.
It's also very clear with the broad language of "significant personal bond" as the only 
qualification that it would be rampantly abused. We've seen that incentivizing people 
to not work as we did over the last few years of Covid did exactly that - people stayed
home.  We're still in a workforce shortage crisis, and this LD is promoting more of the
same.
Let's focus on helping and making an environment where Maine businesses can start, 
grow, and thrive, rather than crushing small businesses and continuing to hand over 
our local jobs and revenue to big box chains and out-of-state companies.
Thank you,
Brittany Wiggins
