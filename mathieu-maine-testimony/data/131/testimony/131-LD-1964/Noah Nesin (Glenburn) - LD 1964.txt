Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the committee: 
 
I thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of LD 1964.  My name is Noah Nesin and 
I am a family doctor. I grew up in Howland, Maine where my dad was the sole doctor for the 
community. He was my role model, and I followed in his footsteps. Over my nearly 4 decades as a family 
doctor, medicine has grown ever more sophisticated, with more resources, more tests, more 
treatments, and in turn, more financial barriers for people. Even patients with top-of-the-line insurance 
are vulnerable to healthcare related financial insecurity.  
Too often, people are forced to delay or deny themselves care because they can’t afford to take time off 
from work. When each paycheck means the difference between having a full plate of food or not, or 
heating their home or not, oftentimes their health is forced to the back burner. I, like every doctor, took 
an oath to care for my patients. And that care is all-encompassing.  It doesn’t end when I recommend a 
treatment, or when they leave my office.   
That is why I’m asking you to pass comprehensive Paid Family & Medical Leave policy as laid out in this 
bill. This bill will provide workers with the time they need, to care for a member of their family or 
address a personal medical issue. It would allow them to seek care, get treatment, and heal without 
risking their livelihood. This is good policy, it is sound policy and It is necessary policy.  And it needs to be 
passed, for the health of our patients, their families and our communities. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Noah Nesin, MD, FAAFP
