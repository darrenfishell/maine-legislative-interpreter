Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Webster Reed and I live in Bangor. I am writing in support of paid family
medical leave for Maine. 
As a former employee of a small business in Maine, I witnessed firsthand the 
incredible challenges faced by individuals who are unable to take time off work to 
care for their loved ones during critical moments. I want to share my story to 
emphasize the urgent need for paid family medical leave in our state and the profound
impact it can have on families facing unimaginable circumstances.
Several years ago, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. 
The news devastated our family, and we knew that the time we had left with her was 
limited. It was an emotionally tumultuous period, filled with doctor's appointments, 
hospital visits, and the constant worry about her well-being.
As the primary caregiver, I felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility to be by her 
side and provide the support she needed during this challenging journey. However, 
my commitment to my job and the financial strain that taking time off would impose 
on my family made it nearly impossible for me to be there for her as much as I 
wanted to be.
Without a paid family medical leave policy in place, I had to make an agonizing 
choice between caring for my terminally ill mother and maintaining my livelihood. I 
had to juggle work responsibilities while constantly worrying about my mother's 
deteriorating condition. The stress and guilt of not being able to fully support her 
during those precious moments were immeasurable.
Maine needs paid family medical leave to alleviate the burden placed on individuals 
like me who are torn between work and caring for their loved ones. A paid family 
medical leave program would provide financial assistance and job protection, 
ensuring that employees can take the time they need to be with their families during 
life-altering moments without sacrificing their income or job security.
By implementing paid family medical leave, Maine can join the ranks of states that 
recognize the importance of supporting their citizens during times of immense 
personal difficulty. It would not only benefit employees and their families but also 
contribute to a more compassionate and equitable society.
By passing this bill, you would not only provide financial relief but also offer 
emotional support and peace of mind to families going through trying times. It would 
allow individuals to focus on what truly matters – the well-being of their loved ones –
without the constant worry of losing their job or struggling to make ends meet.
As a state, Maine has always valued the importance of community and compassion. 
By passing LD 1964, we can live up to these values and demonstrate our commitment
to the well-being of our citizens. I urge lawmakers, employers, and fellow community
members to support and advocate for paid family medical leave in Maine, ensuring 
that no one has to face the heartbreaking choice between work and caring for their 
loved ones in their greatest time of need.
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for taking the time to read about my 
experience and for your consideration on this important issue.
Sincerely, 
Webster Reed
