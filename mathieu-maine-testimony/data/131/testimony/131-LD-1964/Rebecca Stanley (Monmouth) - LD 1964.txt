Monmouth
LD 1964
Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Honorable 
    Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Rebecca Stanley and I am live in Monmouth, ME.  I write today in 
support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission 
to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program.
Maine is experiencing and will continue to experience a great shortage of workers for 
some time. In order to attract workers, the State needs to offer multiple programs to 
make employment attractive. These programs will also help to keep current workers 
in the work force. LD 1964 will improve the lives of our families and our economy at 
the same time.
It has proven to be a successful program in other states. It is time to pass this bill and 
fund paid leave for all Maine workers. It is an investment in our workforce that will 
pay multiple dividends over the years. 
This bill is also about gender equity. Women have borne most of the responsibility for
taking care of family members, and have been forced to choose between their jobs 
and caregiving. This inequity must be addressed by passing this legislation.
Therefore, I urge the committee to support LD 1964. Thank you for your time and 
consideration on this important issue.
