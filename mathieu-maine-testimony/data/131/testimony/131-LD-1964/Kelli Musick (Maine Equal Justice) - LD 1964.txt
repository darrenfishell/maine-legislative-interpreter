Testimony of Kelli Musick, Maine Equal Justice 
In support of LD 1964, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the 
Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program 
May 25, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Kelli Musick, I use she/her pronouns, and I ama 
policy advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonproﬁt legal aid and economic justice organization 
working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. I am testifying 
in support of LD 1964. 
This bill is the result of thousands of hours of discussion, research, and compromise to ensure that 
workers, families, and employers are all better off with its passage. As we return to normal 
following the pandemic, many Mainers — particularly low-income folks, older workers, those with 
less education, people of color, and those in rural, low-income areas — face difficulties attaining 
good, reliable employment that offers the kind of security that this bill would provide. These folks 
often work in low wage jobs that provide less access to any form of leave, paid or unpaid, since they 
are more often employed in jobs with part~time or uncertain work schedules, have shorter job 
tenures, and typically work for smaller business that may not even meet the threshold for unpaid 
leave under the current Family and Medical Leave Act or Maine’s Family and Medical Leave 
statute. ‘ 
Many of the challenges deliberated by this Committee - especially the labor shortage in Maine— 
can be addressed with the creation of a paid family leave program. I have sat with laid-off parents 
who are desperately seeking reemployment but worry what may happen when their child or an 
elderly family member gets sick and needs their care. Without paid family and medical leave, many 
workers are forced into impossible positions when trying to balance work and family. Whether they 
lose their job, or must take leave without pay, many folks have no choice but to tum to public 
assistance to make ends meet?

Access to paid family and medical leave can reduce these taxpayer-funded costs. Researchers from 
Rutgers University ’s Center for Women and Work found that when paid family and medical leave 
is available, it has reduced the number of women who relied on public assistance.3 Without it, the 
data demonstrates that low-Wage workers cover their lost Wages by borrowing money, if they are 
able to, and receiving public beneﬁts.4 Getting access to these beneﬁt programs is oftena 
complicated and drawn-out process that adds additional burdens to a person already in a precarious 
ﬁnancial situation. Paid family leave allows a more seamless transition when a worker encounters a 
family or health emergency. 
While it is evident that the creation of a paid family and medical leave beneﬁts program would 
improve the lives of working families across Maine, doing so would also be beneﬁcial to businesses 
of all sizes throughout the state. In California, which has had a state paid leave program for more 
than a decade, 87% of businesses surveyed reported no increased costs after the program was 
implemented, and 9% reported cost savings resulting ﬁ"om lower worker turnover.5 In addition to 
potential monetary savings, paid family leave policies improve worker participation and retention. 
A partnership study between the March of Dimes’ Center for Social Science Research and the 
Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) found a 20% reduction in the number of women 
leaving their jobs in the ﬁrst year after having a child and up to 50% reduction after ﬁve years in 
states implementing a paid family and medical leave program.6 Furthermore, 83% of workers in 
“lower quality” jobs who used the program returned to their previous employer — a 10-point 
improvement compared to workers who did not use the program.7 This policy provides workers and 
employers increased stability and security in an ever-changing economy. 
Finally, paid family and medical leave helps small businesses compete in the labor market. Larger 
companies are more likely to offer paid leave policies, and when given the choice, working families 
will choose the job with better beneﬁts. Many low-income Mainers work in small businesses, and it 
is imperative that they have the same access to paid leave as other workers. We urge you to remove 
the provision in §850-J that would exempt small businesses from parts of the law relating to 
retaliation or job protection. We must ensure that no one faces retaliation or job loss for taking leave 
that they need and deserve. If small businesses are not offering the same job protections as larger 
employers, they won’t reap the beneﬁts of a state-wide program. If this exemption is not removed, 
marry low-income Mainers will not take leave because they will fear losing their jobs. Job loss can 
quickly cause families with low incomes to become homeless, experience food insecurity, and 
experience ﬁnancial hardships that have long-lasting effects.

While LD 1964 allows for the state to privatize nearly all of the paid leave program, we would 
strongly urge that the program be implemented as a public insurance plan. The data shows that 
administrative costs of state-run paid family and medical leave programs are lower than those run 
by the private sector. Additionally, the higher costs of privatized plans often come at the expense of 
reduced services.8 This program should be a public insurance plan, administered by and for the 
public. Of the states that have paid family and medical leave programs, only one, Connecticut, has 
used a private third party to administer the beneﬁts.9 Connecticut has experienced higher 
administrative costs and higher erroneous claim denial rates than other states. 
Mainers will be better served by keeping this program within state government with strong due 
process avenues for individuals accessing the program, state workers accustomed to implementing 
state laws, and strong oversight from the Legislature. The protections afforded Mainers by state 
agencies rather than private entities can be critical to program success. Overall, the experience of 
states other than Connecticut in administering their programs has been very effective. Here, as the 
Paid Leave Authority establishes program rules and processes for implementation, it can assess the 
best opportunities to contract out aspects of implementation while preserving strong public 
oversight and clear metrics for success. ” 
You should not have to risk your job to take care of your family, nor should you be forced deeper 
into poverty simply to take care of a sick loved one. 
For all the families in our state, I urge you to pass LD 1964 so that we can begin the process of 
creating a paid leave system for Maine. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.
