W e ’ v e
implemented
a
generous
paid
leave
policy
as
a
way
to
support
our
employees
and
company
culture.
W e
hope
that
our
policy
would
raise
the
bar
for
all
employers.
Having
access
to
a
Paid
Family
and
Medical
Leave
Benefits
Program
would
help
break
down
some
of
the
barriers
that
companies
and
small
businesses
face
with
instituting
such
policies.
The
research
shows
that
the
benefits
of
providing
paid
family
leave
are
overwhelming
impactful
to
families.
US
Labor
Laws
are
outdated,
our
workforce
is
not
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
and
laws
need
to
be
put
into
place
to
support
this.
It’ s
not
enough
to
protect
jobs.
Employees,
mothers
and
families
need
to
be
paid.
It
has
also
been
shown
that
proving
paid
leave
decreases
employee
turnover
and
increases
employee
retention.
