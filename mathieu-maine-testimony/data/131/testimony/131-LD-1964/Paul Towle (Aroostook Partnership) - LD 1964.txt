Re: LD 19 64 ‘An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family 
and Medical Leave Benefits Program . 
 
Dear Chairs and Members of the Committee on Labor and Housing ,  
  
I represent the Aroostook Partnership  (AP) , a unique private -public partnership of nearly 100 businesses, 
the Northern Maine Development Commission and the four colleges in Aroostook County. The mission 
of the Partnership is, essentially, to grow Aroostook County’s economy and support our resident s, 
communities, and our quality of life.  
  
On behalf of the Aroostook Partnership, I submit this letter in opposition to LD 1964.  
 
By now you have heard the numerous reasons businesses and residents are opposed to implementing this 
PFMLA in Maine.  Repres enting nearly 100 member -employers in Maine, I have not heard support from 
a single person or business representative for this bill  in the last year I have been assessing the program .  
What I have heard to justify their opposition are the following concern s: 
1. Additional undue financial burdens on their small business  
2. Additional undue financial burdens and confusion regarding qualifications of existing leave/benefits 
programs already offered by  most  larger employers . 
3. Uncertainty on how much this program will eventually cost Maine businesses and employees . 
4. Lack of confidence in the ability to prevent fraud and abuse in the program, especially given the 
DOL’s tendency to side with employees for unemployment benefits regardless of reasons for 
termination . 
5. Lack of  trust in an equitable process to define and enforce “affinity relationships” and the 
vulnerability of HR personnel for questioning leaves based on these hard to define  and sometimes 
vague  relationships . 
6. The difficulty to sustain operations due to staffing  WITHOUT a PFMLA program enticing further 
absenteeism . 
7. Challenges involved in juggling staff to cover extended leaves that will certainly result from such a 
program . 
8. Seemingly no appetite for legislative reforms in unemployment terms leading to a continued  decline 
in workforce participation rates in almost ever y age range yet enthusiasm to promote further 
workplace absenteeism though a PFMLA . 
                                                                      www. aroostookpartnership .org

program . 
10. “If empl oyees feel they need additional insurance against possible leaves from work then they have 
the right to purchase various policies, they shouldn’t be forced to buy one through a payroll tax.”  
11. PFMLA’s inability to move the needle in attracting new workers to  Aroostook County  
 
18 months ago , the Aroostook Partnership convened a “Workforce Crisis Summit” to address the 
increasing challenge to secure enough qualified workers for our existing businesses.  The result was AP 
making workforce development our #1 priority going forward. A PFML progra m in Maine will only 
create headwinds for the many initiatives we are taking on to grow our workforce and sustain our 
businesses, let alone our ability to staff new investments and businesses  attempting to launch in 
Aroostook County.  We simply don’t have enough workers  now and PFML  will subtract from our 
workforce, not add to it.  
 
Without strong businesses to support families and their rural communities, those communities will slowly  
recede .  Our residents will either become more dependent on safety net pr ograms or they’ll  be forced to 
relocate, often seeking the security of larger towns and cit ies downstate.  Aroostook has experienced too 
much of this already and we need policies that support  and grow our businesses which create well -paying 
jobs and are  the lifeblood of our communities.  
 
I realize support for this bill is largely divided along political lines but, before you just follow the will of 
your caucus, I ask you to please consider helping our rural communities thrive and become more self -
sustaining  but voting Ought Not To Pass on LD 1964.  
 
 
Respectfully,
