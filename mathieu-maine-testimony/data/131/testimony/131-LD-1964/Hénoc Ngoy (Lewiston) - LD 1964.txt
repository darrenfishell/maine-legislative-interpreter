Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Labor and 
Housing Committee: My name is Hénoc Ngoy, I live in Lewiston, and I submit this 
testimony in support of LD 1964.
The Maine State Legislature should pass LD 1964 to provide paid leave for Maine 
workers who are unable to work because they or their loved ones need care.  
When Covid-19 hit our community, before rapid testing for the virus was available, I 
got a serious case of the flu. I was sick for three months, unable to work.  Because it 
could have been Covid-19, I was in quarantine for a month. I had no paid sick leave, 
and after that first month, my employer insisted that I resign. That meant I lost my 
medical insurance, and I had no income for 3 months. I had to use up most of my 
savings just to survive. 
It’s very important to pass LD 1964, because for people without savings, if they or 
someone they love gets sick and needs their help, they would be on the street very 
quickly without their wages. Mainers who work hard should have help when they or 
their family needs medical care. This should be a basic human right. I urge you to 
vote “ought to pass” on LD 1964 for the well-being of everyone in our community.  
Thank you.
