Labor and Housing, my name is Pamela Morin, and I am the Executive Direc tor of Family Violence Project, the 
domestic violence resource center serving and supporting survivors of domestic abuse and violence in 
Kennebec and Somerset Counties . On behalf of our organization and the survivors we serve, I urge you to 
support paid safe leave for survivors of domestic abuse and violence in Maine.  
Safe leave wou ld be so impactful for the survivors that work with Family Violence Project. One 
survivor we have worked with recently is employed by a local, small retail store. Her employers are 
understanding about her situation. And, in compliance wi th cu rrent law, the y have given her and will continue 
to give her days off to deal with what she has to deal with to keep her and her daughter safe. However, she does 
not get time off with pay, and she can only take the time if she finds her own shift cove rage.   This survivo r is a 
crime victim whose abuser of ten years "evicted" her from their shared residence while he was in jail for bail 
violation. She had only 30 days to relocate.  She and her daughter found a place to move into, but she couldn't 
afford enoug h time off to completely move out of the complex. If she had had safe leave coverage, she might 
have been able to expeditiously complete the move out without having to work around her work schedule. As it 
is now, many of her possessions remain at the abuse r's home, incl uding social security numbers for herself and 
her children. He had sworn to make her life a living hell if she ever called the police and she feared  that he will 
throw away everything of hers. This is only one recent example, but reflect ive of  the experien ce of so many 
survivors we work with.  
Thank you for the opportunity to share our support for universal paid family leave and, in particular, the 
ability of survivors to have paid leave while they accomplish the tasks essential to keeping them and their 
children safe.
