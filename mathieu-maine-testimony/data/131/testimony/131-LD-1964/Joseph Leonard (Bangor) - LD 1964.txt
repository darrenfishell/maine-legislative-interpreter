LD 1964
Chairman, esteemed members of the Maine Committee on Labor and Housing, I 
come before you today to emphasize the urgent need for the implementation of paid 
family and medical leave benefits through LD 1964, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave 
Benefits Program. I implore you to recognize the profound economic benefits that 
such a policy would unleash, fostering a healthier economy and a more resilient 
workforce for the great state of Maine.
Let us first draw inspiration from countries across the globe that have already 
embraced pro-labor practices, including paid family and medical leave. Nations such 
as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have long recognized the inherent value of 
investing in their workforce, leading to robust economies and enviable standards of 
living. These countries understand that a healthy labor force is not merely a cost but a 
valuable asset that drives productivity, innovation, and economic growth.
By implementing paid family and medical leave, we send a powerful message to 
workers in Maineâ€”that we prioritize their well-being, their families, and their ability 
to balance work and personal responsibilities. This policy not only ensures that 
workers have the necessary support during crucial life events but also nurtures their 
loyalty, commitment, and productivity. A healthier workforce leads to reduced 
turnover, increased employee satisfaction, and heightened levels of engagement, all of
which directly contribute to a more prosperous economy.
Moreover, paid family and medical leave is not an economic burden but a wise 
investment in our society. Studies from around the world consistently demonstrate 
that such policies yield positive economic outcomes. For instance, a study conducted 
by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that
countries with generous family leave policies experienced higher female labor force 
participation rates, contributing to stronger economic growth. In fact, for every 10 
percentage points increase in female employment, GDP per capita rose by nearly 3%.
Let us not fall into the trap of short-sighted thinking, my esteemed committee 
members. Failure to invest in our workforce, to provide the support and protection 
they deserve, can have disastrous consequences for our economy. It leads to increased
turnover, reduced productivity, and diminished worker morale. It perpetuates a cycle 
of inequality, wherein those who cannot afford to take time off work face undue 
hardships, and the most vulnerable among us suffer the most.
As Upton Sinclair, the great American author and advocate for workers' rights, once 
wrote, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends 
upon his not understanding it." We must rise above personal interests and embrace the
undeniable truth that investing in our workforce, ensuring their well-being, and 
granting them paid family and medical leave is not only morally right but also 
economically imperative.
The time has come to take a stand, to create a robust safety net that supports the 
workers of Maine. By passing LD 1964 and implementing a paid family and medical 
leave benefits program, we declare that we are committed to cultivating a healthier 
economy, a more equitable society, and a workforce that thrives. Let us not shy away 
from our responsibility, but rather embrace the vision of a brighter future, where 
workers are empowered, families are supported, and our economy flourishes. The 
choice is clear, my friends. Let us choose progress, let us choose compassion, and let 
us choose economic prosperity. Thank you.
