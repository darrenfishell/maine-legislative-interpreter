Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Ed Fallon, I live in Lewiston, I 
am 84 years of age and I am here today to testify about the importance of LD 1964, "An 
Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family 
and Medical Leave (PFML) Benefits Program" to the people of Maine. 
Like many seniors, I cannot do a lot of simple chores such as laundry, cooking and 
housework on a daily basis. However, when illness strikes, or other emergencies 
happen, I need even more help. l receive a lot of help now from my granddaughter who 
cares enough to call me every morning to help me get going for the day. However, she 
does not have a PFML program at work, so she depends on her employer for time off.I 
am afraid it I need to be cared for an extended time, she will not be able to do so. What 
do I do then? 
I wish l could pay my granddaughter to care for me, but I am a Veteran on Social 
Security who has little to spend except on rent and food. With a strong PFML program 
in Maine she could take the time to care for me without fear of losing wages to help 
support her own family, or losing herjob if she does so. 
Lots of Seniors will face the same situation. Having family members who are willing to 
help, but not able to do so.. We need a PFML program desperately in Maine. 
I hope you will give the PFML program extraordinary diligence in your deliberation. 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. 
Ed Fallon
