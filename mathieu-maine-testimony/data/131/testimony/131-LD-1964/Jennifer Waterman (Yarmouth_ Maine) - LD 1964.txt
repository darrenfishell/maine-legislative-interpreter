Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Jennifer Waterman and I live in Yarmouth, Maine. I am testifying in 
support of paid family and medical leave for Maine. 
As a small business owner of a private clinical mental health practice, I am not only 
one of Maine’s essential service providers, I also do not get paid if I do not see my 
clients. When caring for my dying mother recently, I was unable to take the time off I 
needed to care for her. I could not afford to loose my income…and the care she 
needed was unavailable from health services. The anguish and pain of this 
predicament haunts me.  The financial costs continue to burden me.
Where our health care systems, including child care and elder care, routinely fail us, 
we as individuals have been forced to bear the financial and emotional cost of caring 
for ourselves and our loved ones. This is an impossible task that leaves us with 
financial crisis and health crisis.
If I had access to Maine State paid family medical leave in the time leading up to my 
mother’s passing, she could have passed with the dignity and care we each deserve.  I 
would have avoided incurring debt, which has been a struggle to pay off.
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for listening, I’m happy to answer any 
questions. 
Sincerely, 
Jennifer Waterman
