Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program  
 
May 25 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony neither for nor against  LD 
1964  on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’ s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Please forgive the brevity of this testimony, as our policy committee met a few hours ago 
to establish positions  on a variety of bills , includ ing LD 1964.  
Municipal leaders  are general ly support ive of  the concept, as several communi ties 
provide a version of the benefits described in LD 1964 to municipal  employ ees.  However, l ocal 
leaders do have questions  with respect to how th e proposal  could  impact , potentially positively, 
the municipal costs associated with other  employee benefit programs su ch as workers’  
compensati on and local income protection programs .  Additionally, municipal officials  are 
interested in exploring the possibility  of an alternate , but similar  program  and requirement , that 
consider  the unique functions, operations and funding of local government operations . 
In a nutshell,  to extend there is opportunity to further di scuss a nd refine  the proposal , 
MMA is willing to assist  in the pro cess. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 1-800-452-8786 
or kdufour@memun.org . 
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective.
