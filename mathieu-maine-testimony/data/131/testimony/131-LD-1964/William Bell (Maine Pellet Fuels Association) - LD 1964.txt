Statement in Opposition to LD 1964, An Act to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Commission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical 
Leave Benefits Program. 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing:  
 
Our Association is a standard trade association incorporated in the State of Maine. 
Our members include Maine’s four heating pellet manufacturers, located in 
Ashland, Athens, Strong, and Sanford; a major pellet heating equipment assembly 
firm in Bethel; a number of heating system installers, and several non-profit 
organizations concerned with the economy of rural Maine.  
 
Our pellet manufacturing firms provide an important market for what is essentially 
the waste wood from Maine’s sawmills. The FOR/Maine forest opportunity 
roadmap identifies the importance of our sector to Maine’s rural economy.  
 
However, as a survey of wood pellet retailers will readily reveal, our product faces 
stiff competition from wood pellets manufactured in Quebec and New Brunswick 
Provinces. The International Trade Commission provides for an anti-dumping 
countervailing duty on Canadian softwood lumber entering the U.S. but this duty 
does not apply to wood heating pellets from right across Maine’s border.  
 
Our manufacturing members, who greatly value their employees especially during 
the current workforce shortages in Maine, strongly oppose the far-reaching 
mandates incorporated in LD 1964 and urge the Maine’s Legislature’s defeat of 
this economically threatening proposal.
