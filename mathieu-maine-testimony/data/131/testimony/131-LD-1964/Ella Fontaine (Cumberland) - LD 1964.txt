Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Ella Fontaine and I have lived in Cumberland, Maine for 19 years, my 
whole life. I am testifying in support of paid family and medical leave for Maine. 
Please take the time to read the following facts related to the urgency of paid family 
medical leave: 
The United States is the only high-income country that does not provide paid family 
leave.
Womenâ€™s incomes drop 30 percent after the birth of their first child and never catch 
up. Meanwhile, men make roughly 20 percent more once they have children.
74 percent of working women would have no savings left if they took eight weeks of 
unpaid maternity leave.
In 2021, 38 million family caregivers in the US provided an estimated 36 billion 
hours of unpaid care to older or disabled adult family members, worth $600 billion. 
The number of Americans needing long-term care services will more than double 
from 12 million people in 2010 to 27 million people by 2050. At the same time, the 
number of potential caregivers for people ages 80 and older will decline by more than 
half in that same timeframe. 
I expect to see your support LD 1964 if you support the working class of Maine. 
Sincerely, 
Ella Fontaine
