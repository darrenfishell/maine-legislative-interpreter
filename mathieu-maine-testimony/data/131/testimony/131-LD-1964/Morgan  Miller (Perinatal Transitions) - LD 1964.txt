Perinatal Transitions Letter of Support for LD1964:  An Act to Implement the Recommendations of theCommission to Develop a Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, an honorable members of the Joint StandingCommittee on Labor and Housing, Perinatal Transitions is testifying in support of paid family and medical leave for Maine. Our organization is devoted to protecting growing families in Maine and we know the direct impacts of limited paid family and medical leave.  Research is clear that having paid and supported time off for both the birthing person and their partner, leads to better health outcomes for the birthing person and the newborn. This includes lower incidence of postpartum mood disorders, higher rates of breastfeeding and lower likelihood of exposure to infectious diseases for the newborn. With the passage of LD1964 Maine families would benefit from increased support and lower stress levels in the postpartum period. We hope you will support LD1964. Thank you for listening to our perspective. We are happy to answer any questions you may have and can be reached at perinataltransitions@gmail.com. Sincerely, The Perinatal Transitions Collaborative
