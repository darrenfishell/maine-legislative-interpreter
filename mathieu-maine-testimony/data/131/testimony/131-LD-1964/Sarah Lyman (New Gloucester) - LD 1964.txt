Dear Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Labor and Housing, 
My name is Sarah Lyman and I live in New Gloucester, ME. I am writing in support 
of paid family and medical leave for Maine. 
As a Maine resident who has a family history of serious health conditions and is a 
primary support system for multiple people who live some distance from me, having 
access to the Paid Family and Medical Leave program would be an incredible stress 
relief. 70% of Mainers agree with me because they want to be able to keep their jobs 
and care for their loved ones.
The caregivers I know, mostly women, have had to make extremely difficult 
decisions. How do you choose between caring for the child or parent that needs you 
and having the pay you need to provide for them?
These decisions are made even more difficult for Mainers living in rural areas, 
working for small businesses, and lower income folks, who have additional 
challenges when having to make these impossible choices. 
Please develop and fund a public Paid Family and Medical Leave Benefits Program to
show Mainers that they are valued even when they choose to care for a loved one or 
themselves. That they can relax knowing that they can be a caregiver when they need 
to be and still return to their work without retaliation or risk of being fired. This 
program is about Mainers caring for Mainers. Isn't that the Maine way? 
I hope you will support LD 1964. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Sarah
