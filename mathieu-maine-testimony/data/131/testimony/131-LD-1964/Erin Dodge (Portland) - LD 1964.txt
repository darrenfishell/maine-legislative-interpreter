Being able to take time off from work is such an enormous boon to working people 
, and a great equalizer for caregivers, women, disabled, chronically ill people in 
particular. The pandemic has shown us that our health and well-being depends so 
much on the health and well-being of everyone else, and being able to stay home 
when sick or caring for a sick loved one is so so vital. It is time to pass and FUND 
paid leave for all Maine workers!
