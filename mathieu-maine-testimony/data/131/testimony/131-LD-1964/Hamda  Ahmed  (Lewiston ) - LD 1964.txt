Senator Tipping and Representative Roeder and the esteemed committee of Labor & 
Housing: My name is Hamda Ahmed, I live in Lewiston and currently work for the Office 
of Population Health Equity at Maine CDC. I am writing this testimony to support the 
creation of paid family and medical leave for Maine.  
 
Previous to my current job, during the pandemic, I was a case manager and a program 
manager at New Mainers Public Health Initiative, one of the largest ethnic-based 
organizations in the Lewiston/Auburn area. I worked with some of the most vulnerable 
populations, essential workers who lived paycheck to paycheck. Some community 
members were severely impacted by Covid-19 and were forced to go back to work 
without fully recovering. Some of them lost their jobs, and others lived with the stress of 
being sick and fearing to lose their jobs without any income to survive.  
 
No one deserves to be under the stress of financial burden while taking care of their 
health or the health of their loved ones. LD 1964 will allow workers to have up to 12 
weeks of paid leave. People are working 2 or 3 jobs and still having difficulties 
maintaining financial stability. I believe that if this bill passes, it will help workers that do 
not have this opportunity yet to be more secure.  
 
I am urging the committee to vote for this bill and give Maine workers the freedom to 
take care of their health and take care of their loved ones when needed.
