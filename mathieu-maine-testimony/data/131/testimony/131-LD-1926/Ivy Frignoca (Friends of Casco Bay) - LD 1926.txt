RE: Friends of Casco Bay Testimony in Support of LD 1926, An Act to 
Impose a Morat orium on New Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the 
Lower Presumpscot River  
 Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of 
the Committee,  
 Friends of Casco Bay supports LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Morat orium on 
New Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River  
and respectfully requests that the Committee vote that the bill Ought T o Pass. This 
bill p laces  a four year hold on new point source disc harges into  the lower 
Presumpscot River , from Sac carappa Falls in Westbrook to head of tide in 
Falmouth . This section of river is designated as a Class C water, but  functions at or 
near the Class B  water quality standard, following years of restoration efforts.  This 
is a remarkable improvement in water quality . The  lower Presumpscot was once 
known as “the dirtiest little section of river in the state,” and could not even meet 
the Class C water quality standard!

 The bill will not  affect operation of the Westbrook wastewater treatment plant or 
of the Sappi Mill. It will not prevent new businesses from being covered under existing stormwater permits, especially the M ulti-Sector G eneral P ermit designed 
to reduce stormwater pollution fr om most commercial and industrial sources and 
the MS4 general permit which regulates stormwater discharged from municipal  
separate storm sewer system s.  
 The bill will temporarily ban new industry from obtaining permits  to discharge pollution from  new  
individual point sources, such as another mill  with its own treatment plant. The intent is to allow time 
for the remaining scientific studies to be conducted on the lower Presumpscot and for the Department  of 
Environmental Protection and EPA to determine how that data should be interpreted, to inform whether the segment should be upgraded to Class B. Once we know that, any new industry can be permitted and its discharge limits c ould be set to ensure water quality remains at current or higher levels .  
 We believe the existing anti- degredation provision of Maine’s water quality standards will be inadequate 
to protect existing water quality. That provision allows a certain amount of degredation and will not 
consider that the segment mostly or entirely functions  at a Class B level.

Protecting the health of the lower Presumpscot matters to us. For over 30 years, Friends of Casco Bay 
has worked to improve and protect the environmental health of Casco Bay. We care deeply about the health of the Presumpscot  River . It drains two -thirds  of our watershed, flowing from pristine headlands 
through some of Maine’s most urbanized areas. The restoration of water quality in the lower Presumpscot has  brought back habitat for many fish, birds, and other wildlife  that depend on both salt 
and fresh water habitats . The river brings significant flows of fresh water to the estuary, making it a rich 
nursery ground for many species. It also delivers significant loads of pollutants that we and others have worked hard to reduce  to improv e and protect environmental health.  We do not want to see any reversal 
in water quality. The Clean Water Act, in fact, prohibits any degradation in water quality.  
 The restored lower Presumpscot supports increased human use of  the river  in some of Maine’s most 
diverse neighborhoods. Urban trails and access points allow all residents to hike, fish, swim, boat  and 
seek solace along the river. The healthier waters form the backbone of Westbrook’s emergence as a desirable Portland suburb. We  have appended a Fact Sheet with more details about the river, which you 
may receive from multiple sources. It is worth reading.  
 For the foregoing reasons, w e respectfully  request  you vote that LD 1926 Ought T o Pass. Thank you for 
considering our comment s.  
 Respectfully submitted,
