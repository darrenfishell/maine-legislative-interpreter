Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point
Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River
Greetings and thank you for your continued efforts as we approach the summer break.
My name is Karen Staples Prieto - I grew up in Topsham, and now live in Brunswick 
after many years out of state.
As a citizen who has reconnected with the natural world around us, and realized that 
we must proactively protect our state's beautiful resources, I ask you to please vote 
"ought to pass" for LD 1926. 
Through the Friends of Casco Bay (a nonprofit dedicated to protecting this nationally 
significant estuary from pollution and local impact of climate change), I have learned 
that the Presumpscot is the largest freshwater river flowing into Casco Bay and thus 
has a major influence on the health of the estuary and all of its wildlife.
Water quality in the lower Presumpscot has greatly improved - resulting in restored 
wildlife habitat, popular recreation, and commercial opportunities - but additional 
study is needed to identify best methods for permanently protecting this important 
watershed. 
The temporary moratorium described in LD 1926 will preserve our progress while a 
long term solution is identified, with no impact to existing discharges (Portland Water
District, Westbrook Wastewater Treatment Facility, and the Sappi Mill). 
Mainers have a fundamental right to clean air and water. With this in mind, please 
support LD 1926. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
