Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee, 
My name is Mary M. Cerullo. I live at 129 Christopher Road, North Yarmouth.
I am writing to ask you to support LD 1926:  An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New
Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River
I am very familiar with the history of recent efforts that have resulted in remarkable 
improvements in the water quality of the lower Presumpscot River. I served as 
Associate Director of  Friends of Casco Bay from 1998 to 2020. The mission of 
Friends of Casco Bay is to improve and protect the water quality of Casco Bay.
One of our early efforts was a collaborative campaign to require Sappi to meet the 
same water quality standards that it had instituted elsewhere. Instead, the company 
closed the worst  polluting aspect of its operation, resulting in a startling and rapid 
improvement in the water quality of the river (and the smell in Westbrook!).
Many colleagues and community members have continued to  push for further 
improvements. This bill will allow for long-term planning. It is the next logical step to
ensure that this highly populated and popular region continues on the right path for 
years to come.
I urge you to support LD 1926, to institute a temporary moratorium on new 
discharges. The new law will not affect existing discharges by the Portland Water 
District, Westbrook Wastewater Treatment Facility, and the Sappi Mill.  
Thank you for your consideration and for your service to the State of Maine.
Sincerely yours,
 Mary M. Cerullo
