LD 1926
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the members of the 
Committee of Environmental and Natural Resources,
My name is Edward Kaynor and I live in Portland. I am writing today to ask you to 
support LD 1926: An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste 
Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River.
I have a masters in Native American Studies and know how the natural landscape is 
an integral part of Native American beliefs and worship.  I know that rivers and 
watersheds are life sustaining forces of nature that should not be tampered with much 
less polluted.  Since returning to Portland I have joined Friends of the Presumpscot 
River and plan to continue advocating for the river as well as for the abundant natural 
resources we find in the Maine environment.
Thank you for your work on this committee.
Edward Kaynor
