LD 1926
My nose can testify to the improved scent of the Presumpscot River since I was a 
child in the 1960s.
Growing up downriver from SD Warrren was a breathtaking experience, especially on
foggy days that held the scent around my home. 
The situation has been so much better in recent years! Now I write in support of LD 
1926.
Riverwater quality is an important ongoing issue. Definitely we need to allow time for
thorough study before allowing any discharge into the river. I support a 4-year 
moratorium on issuing new waste discharge licenses.
