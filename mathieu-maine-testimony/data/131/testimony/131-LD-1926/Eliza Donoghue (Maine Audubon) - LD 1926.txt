Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1926,
An
Act
to
Impose
a
Moratorium
on
New
Point
Source
W aste
Dischar ge
Licenses
on
the
Lower
Presumpscot
River ,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
In
2022,
Maine
Audubon
joined
scores
of
other
conservation
advocates
in
advocating
before
the
129th
Legislature
to
update
the
lower
Presumpscot
River
“from
Saccarappa
Falls
to
tidewater”
from
Class
C
to
Class
B.
That
specific
ef fort
was
not
successful.
This
bill
will
support
future
ef forts
to
upgrade
this
river
that
is
important
to
so
many .
The
Presumpscot
River
runs
past
Maine
Audubon’ s
headquarters
at
Gilsland
Farm
in
Falmouth,
and
is
a
treasured
resource
by
all
who
visit
us.
W e
lead
weekly
bird
walks
all
year
long
and
enjoy
seeing
the
many
shorebirds,
ducks,
herons,
osprey ,
and
eagles
that
frequent
the
river .
In
addition,
our
educators
and
students
visit
the
Presumpscot
to
teach
about
water
quality ,
riparian
habitat,
and
the
connections
between
the
upper
watershed,
the
lower
watershed,
and
Casco
Bay .
W e
have
seen
first-hand
how
the
river
has
gone
from
being
intensely
polluted
to
today’ s
much
cleaner
and
more
vibrant
waterway .
It
is
thrilling
to
see
the
fish
return
and
also
see
people
boating,
birding,
fishing,
and
swimming
where
previously
the
river
was
shunned.
W ith
that
background
and
a
review
of
the
Friends
of
Presumpscot
River ’ s
water
quality
testing
data,
Maine
Audubon
supported
–
and
continues
to
support
–
reclassification.
W e
believe
the
Friends
have
demonstrated
that
this
river
reach
already
meets
or
exceeds
higher
water
quality
standards.
However ,
that
demonstrated
quality
may
be
jeopardized
if
the
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
issues
new
waste
dischar ge
licenses
for
that
portion
of
the
river .
LD
1926
would
impose
a
moratorium
on
new
licenses
until
January
1,
2028,
by
which
time,
hopefully ,
the
river
will
be
reclassified
and
ultimately
be
subject
to
stronger
projections.

W e
ur ge
the
Committee
to
support
this
important
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
