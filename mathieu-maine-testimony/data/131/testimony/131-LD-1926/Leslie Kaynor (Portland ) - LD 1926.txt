LD 1926
Greetings Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the members of the 
Committee of Environmental and Natural Resources,
My name is Leslie Kaynor and I live in Portland. I am writing today to ask you to 
support LD 1926: An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste 
Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River.
The Lower Presumpscot River needs this emergency and temporary protection of its 
water quality, a quality that many have long fought hard for. As a member of Friends 
of Presumpscot River I have been involved with numerous events to learn about the 
river, its history and the restoration of habitat for fish, birds and other wildlife. I have 
taken many walks along the trails and really appreciated the beauty and health of the 
river. Having worked in the past on watershed mapping for the City of Portland, I am 
well aware of the significance that the health of the Presumpscot River has on the 
health of Casco Bay estuary, as the river drains two thirds of the Casco Bay 
Watershed. The four year moratorium on new pollution discharges will give time 
needed to figure out ways to protect and to further improve the water quality of this 
great resource.
Thank you for your work on this committee.
