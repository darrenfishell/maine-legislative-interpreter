LD 1926
Good Day Senator Brenner (Senate Chair of the Committee) and Representative
Gramlich {House Chair of the Committee}, and members of the committee. My name
is Janice Erickson, and I live in Westbrook. I am writing today to ask you to support:
LD 1926; An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge 
Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River
Please support protecting the lower section of the Presumpscot River. Great strides 
have been made to make this great river great again - its critical for our community to 
have support for this river. Protect this river supports all those that use it and there are
many. We have a treasure, lets protect it.
The lower Presumpscot River and its’s impacts on the Presumpscot and Casco Bay 
and support the
communities along it and in the region must be seen as precious and in need of 
protection. I live on the river and walk it everyday. I see more and more river wild life
each year! It’s spectacular. I kayak with my friends and swim in it as well. It’s very 
dear to all who live along and near this great body of water.
Please support LD 1926. 
Thank you for your time and I would gladly answer any questions I could.
