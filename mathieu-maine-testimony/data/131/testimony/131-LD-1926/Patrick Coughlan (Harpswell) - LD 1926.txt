Protecting the Presumpscot River is crucial to the clean up and preservation of Casco 
Bay.  The lower Presumpscott River through hard work and dedication has gone from 
sewers like water quality to acceptable.  A 4 year moratorium on "new" discharges 
will give the river a chance to establish it recover, and the State an opportunity to 
develop appropriate regulations to keep the river clean.
