Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
members
of
the
committee:
My
name
is
Paul
Drinan,
and
I
live
in
W estbrook.
I
am
writing
today
to
ask
you
to
support
LD
1926.
For
many
years,
my
friends
and
family
have
joined
me
on
excursions
on
the
Presumpsoct
River
which
flows
through
Windham,
W estbrook,
Portland,
and
then
on
to
Casco
Bay .
The
lower
Presumpscot
River
is
heavily
used
for
recreation.
People
swim
and
fish
in
areas
that
were
once
too
polluted
for
human
contact
and
fish
consumption.
The
lower
Presumpscot
hosts
public
trails,
preserves,
and
boat
launches.
There
are
many
areas
for
fishing,
as
well
as
locations
for
swimming,
tubing
and
white
water
kayaking.
Its
waters
flow
past
Maine
Audubon’ s
Gilsland
Farm
as
it
enters
the
bay ,
another
highly
visited
nature
preserve
that
showcases
the
ecology
of
the
estuary ,
such
as
jumping
sturgeon.
Additionally ,
my
job
requires
me
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
Casco
Bay
where
I’ve
witnessed
greatly
improved
water
quality
-
undoubtedly
the
result
of
years
of
advocacy
and
partnerships
between
organizations
such
as
Friends
of
The
Presumpscot
River ,
Friends
of
Casco
Bay ,
and
Portland
W ater
District,
to
name
a
few .
In
an
ef fort
to
continue
providing
a
safe
recreational
resource
and
approriate
environmental
stewardship,
I
ask
that
you
support
LD
1926,
An
Act
to
Impose
a
Moratorium
on
New
Point
Source
W aste
Discharge
Licenses
on
the
Lower
Presumpscot
River .
Thank
you,
Paul
Drinan
W estbrook,
Maine
