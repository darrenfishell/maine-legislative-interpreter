The Presumpscot River is vital to the health of the communities it runs through and to
Casco Bay. This is a critical bill calling for a 4-year moratorium to allow time to plan 
and implement permanent water quality protection for the lower Presumpscot River.  
The lower river has made great gains in the water quality. Because of this the fish and
wildlife are returning, this area of the river is highly utilized recreationally, and the 
positive effects are felt far out into Casco Bay.
However, without protections these gains can be lost. This bill would still allow for 
growth and it would not alter the license capacity of Portland Water District, 
Westbrook or Sappi. It only restricts any new discharge licenses.
