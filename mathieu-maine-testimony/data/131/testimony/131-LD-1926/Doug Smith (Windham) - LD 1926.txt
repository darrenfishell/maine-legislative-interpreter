LD 1926
My name is Doug Smith.  I have been a resident of South Windham for 20 years and 
live on the Presumpscot River.  The quality of the river water is very much a back 
yard issue for me as is my concern about quality of waters flowing into Casco Bay 
and fish migration.  The Presumpscot River is an ecosystem from the watershed to the
Casco Bay.   
I write today to ask you to vote OUGHT TO PASS for LD1926.  This is a critical bill 
that calls for a 4-year moratorium.
More specifically, until the necessary testing is completed this bill will provide 
protection for the lower river water quality.  To date the lower river has made great 
gains in the water quality.  As a result the fish and wildlife are returning, this area of 
the river is highly utilized by boaters and fisherman and has had a remarkable, 
positive effects felt far out into Casco Bay. 
But, without protections offered by LD1926, these gains can be lost.  This bill allows 
for growth and orderly development, it would not alter the license capacity of 
Portland Water District, Westbrook or Sappi.  It only restricts any NEW discharge 
licenses.
Please vote  Ought to Support on "Ought to Pass" on May 17.
Thank You,
Doug Smith
