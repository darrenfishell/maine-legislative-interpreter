 May 17, 20231  LD 1926: An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River  Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee:  Thank you for this opportunity to submit this testimony in support of LD 1926: An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River. The Presumpscot River is vital part of Westbrook, a precious resource that represents the City’s vibrant future. We support the objectives of this new initiative because it’s our understanding that the river stretch from Saccarappa Falls to the tidal section is virtually in attainment of Class B standards now, and should not be put at risk for non-attainment of these standards. In 2022 we shared our support for “LD 1964: An Act To Update Certain Water Quality Standards and To Reclassify Certain Waters of the State, with the amendment introduced by Representative Bell to upgrade the Presumpscot River from Saccarappa Falls to tidewater to Class B.” It is our understanding that the 2022 effort and proposed Presumpscot upgrade was held back because of issues of concern to Maine DEP as they interpreted and modeled data collected by continuous monitoring, technology which was not present when the original water quality standards were put in place. It is our understanding that the goal of this current initiative is to keep the river from slipping out of attaining Class B standards so further data collection can definitively confirm the river attains Class B and is eligible for upgrade under M.R.S. 38 §464.4.F(4) . We believe this effort deserves your thorough consideration. Thank you,    Landis Hudson Executive Director
