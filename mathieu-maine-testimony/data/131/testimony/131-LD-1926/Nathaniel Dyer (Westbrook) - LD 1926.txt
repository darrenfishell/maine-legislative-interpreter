LD 1926
Hello, my name is Nathaniel Dyer and I live at 10 Burnham Street Westbrook, ME. I 
am writing in support of the LD 1926 - An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point
Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River. I use the 
Presumpscot River frequently above and below the Saccarappa falls, and am very 
aware of how point source pollution is impacting the river water quality and it's 
recreational uses. I like to kayak, fish, and swim in the river with my family, but am 
wary of any existing outfall pipes, and the CSO discharge that occurs when we have 
rain events. I will not use the river after these events for a few days for the water to 
clear and the pollution. This issue is one created in the past when river water quality 
was not a concern, Now with modern water treatment processes and water quality 
control methods there is absolutely no reason we should be allowing any additional 
point source pollution into our recovering waters under any circumstances. 
Developers may argue that the cost is prohibitive to properly treat and discharge 
polluted water through non-point source means, but I would argue that the cost of 
allowing any additional point source discharge in our fragile and recovering river 
ecosystem would be vastly higher to the river, and the individuals and communities 
that use it and rely on it for recreation, tourism, and the many other uses and activities
that benefit from clean water and healthy ecosystems. Please adopt this LD 1926 to 
protect our river and the future of our natural resources. The Presumpscot river needs 
protection and stewardship not more pollution. Nathaniel  Dyer - member Westbrook 
Recreation and Conservation Commission.
