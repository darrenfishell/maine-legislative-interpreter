LD 1926
Good morning Senator Brenner and Representative Gramlich, and members of the 
committee. My name is Justin Lacroix, and I live in Gorham, Maine. I am writing 
today to ask you to support:
LD 1926; An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge 
Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River. 
Last fall I was with my daughters at the Presumpscot in Westbrook and we saw a 
loon. I had never seen one in that section of river before. I'm not a biologist but Iâ€™ll 
assume that means the river is healthy and recovering from years upon years of abuse.
I am a dad though and do know I want my kids to keep seeing the positive change in 
the river like that loon, plus more fish and more recreation opportunities.  It would be 
a shame to go backwards with protecting the river. We have done enough damage to 
the Presumpscot and it's time to treat it less as our personal sewer and more like the 
one of a kind natural resource it is. 
Thank you for your time
Justin
