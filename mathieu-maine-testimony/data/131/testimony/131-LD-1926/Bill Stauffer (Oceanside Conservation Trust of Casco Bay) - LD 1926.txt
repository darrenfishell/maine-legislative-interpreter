Dear Maine State Legislature, 
 
Our organization, Oceanside Conservation Trust of Casco Bay supports 
LD1926. As a Portland, Maine based conservation trust responsible for 
conserving natural habitat in Casco Bay, we understand the importance 
of preserving the quality of the water that enters Casco Bay. Our board 
includes wildlife biologists and environmental scientists. One of the 
responsibilities in our land stewardship is inventorying bird and other 
wildlife populations, all of which are affected by the quality of the water 
in Casco Bay. Our organization is not against commercial activity and 
growth, as long as it is regulated and done with the protection of the 
surrounding environment in mind. We hope that you will pass LD1926.  
Thank you. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Bill Stauffer 
Vice President, Oceanside Conservation Trust of Casco Bay
