Wayne Cobb
Portland
LD 1926
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee. My name
is Wayne Cobb, and I live in Portland. The lower Presumpscot River runs just two 
miles from my doorstep, and I visit it often. I am writing today to ask you to support 
LD 1926; An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge 
Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot.
Several decades ago, wastewater from growing municipal and industrial development 
introduced toxic chemicals into the river, causing the Presumpscot to be declared one 
of the nation's “most endangered rivers.” I remember the noxious smell of the river 
from those times.
Since the 1970’s the river has undergone a profound transformation. Fish are 
returning from the ocean to the river’s main stem and tributaries. My partner and I 
participate in annual fish counts at the Highland Lake dam.
We have before us a chance to return much of the river to its natural beauty, bounty 
and flow. Temporarily preventing new discharges will protect the Presumpscot’s 
substantial restorative gains in water quality until stakeholders agree on a plan for 
long-term protection.
Please support LD 1926.
