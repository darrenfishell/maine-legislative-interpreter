Testimony in support of LD 1926 by Will Plumley, Friends of the Presumpscot River 
May 17, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, 
My name is Will Plumley I am a board member and founder of Friends of the Presumpscot 
River and live at 46 Main Street in Windham 
I am tesufying in support of LD 1926: An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source 
Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River 
I testify today to brieï¬‚y explain why Friends of the Presumpscot River initiated this bill, why it is 
so important to pass it, and what IS at risk if it does not pass 
At its core, this issue and this bill are very simple Water quality in the lower Presumpscot has 
improved to the point where, even under the most adverse conditions, actual water quality 
greatly exceeds the minimum requirements for its Class C status Specifically, under the worst 
conditions, actual dissolved oxygen (D0) levels in the lower river are now approximately 70 
Parts Per Million (PPM) Minimum requirement for Class C is only 5 0 PPM So, the current 
water quality exceeds Class C by about 2 0 PPM Dissolved oxygen is critically important to fish 
and the overall health of the ecosystem 
This 2 0 PPM gap between required and actual DO IS referred to as "the remaining assimilauve 
capacity" And this is how much of the water quality will remain at risk without this temporary 
moratorium DEP's Antidegradation Policy (Brian Kavanah, June 13, 2001) spells it out No new 
discharge IS allowed to consume more than 20% of the remaining assimilative capacity So, for 
the lower Presumpscot River, if an applicant for a new discharge appears, DEP could issuea 
license for a discharge expected to consume O 4 PPM, thereby reducing actual dissolved to 66 
PPM Then additional licenses could be issued for up to 20% of the remaining assimilative 
capacity each t1me In this formula, 5 0 acts as an asymptote and allows new licenses to be 
issued right down to the Class C minimum D0 of 5 O PPM in the river 
Many people believe the lower Presumpscot should have received the requested reclassification 
to Class B in the recent Triennial process An upgrade to Class B would protect the current level 
of water quality 
Without the upgrade to Class B, we are left with a situation where the DEP will only protect 71% 
of the dissolved oxygen in the river, leaving it at risk of significant deterioration 
Testing and discussion of the lower Presumpscot continue, and we need to maintain the gains 
we have made to allow time to either reclassify the lower Presumpscot River to Class B or 
create a long-term plan to protect the health of these waters in a different way Without this 
moratorium, the health of the lower Presumpscot remains at risk This moratorium IS a prudent 
and much-needed precautionary action 
If DEP testifies against this moratorium, which they may, l implore you to pass it anyway
