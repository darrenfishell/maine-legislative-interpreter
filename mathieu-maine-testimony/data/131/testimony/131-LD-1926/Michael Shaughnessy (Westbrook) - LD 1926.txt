Good Morning, Senate Chair Brenner and House Chair Gramlich and all members of the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee Thank you for hearing this bill I ask for your support for LD 1926 
My name is Michael Shaughnessy. I live in Westbrook. I am President and a founder of the Friends of the Presumpscot RiverI 
want to thank Representative Art Bell for his sponsorship and Representatives Reilly, Salisbury and Gattine, for being co-sponsors. 
Prior to the industrialization the Presumpscot River it had vast runs of Alewife and Blueback Herring, Shad, and Salmon It had 
thirteen sets of falls and a total drop of 250 feet over 27 miles The Abenaki that lived along and from it For many years Presumpscot 
River was an open sewer with residential and industrial discharges ﬂowing into it The river could be seen, and smelled, far into Casco 
Bay Over time Industrial effects have lessened and waste treatment measures have made a tremendously positive impact on water 
quality Once shunned the lower Presumpscot River now has multiple trails and parks and young and old regularly tube, paddle, ﬁsh 
and swim within it Due to ﬁsh passage and dam removals anadromous ﬁsh are also returning 
However, with all the gains and the rivers inherent resiliency, rt is still fragile and dependent on the care we offer rt It IS vulnerable to 
high temperature, low dissolved oxygen levels and a lacking in micro-invertebrates The river should be seen less as a means of 
carrying waste and more as a resource that while having discharges continues to be enhanced We must recognize that the health 
and well-being of the communities the river touches is intricately tied to the health of the river Also, that the care we show, and the 
lengths we go, in protecting the river is a direct reﬂection on our values toward the environment and toward future generations 
The Presumpscot River runs through the some of the most densely populated and diverse sections of the state bearing both new 
Mainers and those that have been here for generations For many this is the river they come to know rivers through 
I am a Westbrook City Councilor While I do not speak for the Administration or for the Council I can say unequivocally that those that 
I represent deeply value this river There was a survey done a few years ago in Westbrook by USM students under Professor Rachel 
Bouvier In this two kinds of value were most emphasized relative to the river "Existence Value" where the public values its simple 
existence with no regard for personal use or beneﬁt, and "Heritage Value" where it is valued as a legacy to be passed down to future 
generations 
There are other signs of the lower rivers returning health It is increasingly a focal of the revitalization of the Downtown Westbrook 
with a soon to be extended river walk In 2019 the Falmouth Town Council emphasized the river's resurgence by adopting a 
resolution designating the section of the river within it as ”The Lower Presumpscot Natural River Corridor" The Maine DEP in the 
interactive Waterbody Classiﬁcation History Case Studies Map A case study titled the Presumpscot River Biological monitoring and 
water quality modeling, it states that “Class C aquatic life standards had been achieved, and as of 2015 improvement has been such 
that standards for Class B aquatic life has been attained" This river is coming back 
Westbrook and neighboring communities are growing and a burden of that growth is felt on the river As our infrastructure, services 
and schools must be invested in to keep up with that growth so must our capacity to care for the river This moratorium will allow us 
time to gauge the full health of the river and ﬁnd a balance toward a responsible use and stewardship in a time of unprecedented 
and unpredictable growth This is critical and of immediate concern not for what we know is occurring But for what we do not know 
and expect This moratorium will not put an end to residential or commercial development There IS still ample capacity within the 
9#Sﬂﬂ discharge licenses The river should not bear the burden of our growth unaided but instead should be a point of pride in our 
capacity to allow future growth while creating an increasingly healthy Presumpscot River and Casco Bay into which it ﬂows 
Please offer your leadership toward the revival of this river by supporting LD 1926 Thank You,
