LD 1926
Dear Senator Stacy Brenner, Rep. Lori Gramlich and Members of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee:
I am writing to urge you to pass LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New 
Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot.
--Water quality in the lower Presumpscot River has improved dramatically in the past 
20 years, restoring the river’s environmental health and the area’s economic value.  
--The Presumpscot is extremely important to the health of the Casco Bay watershed, 
both freshwater and saltwater habitats and our fishing industry.
--LD 1926 secures a four-year moratorium on new industrial discharges will preserve 
the river’s health while a long term solution is identified. 
--The four years allotted in this moratorium will allow time to finish studies of the 
lower Presumpscot River and determine the best means of protecting water quality.
I urge you to pass this important bill.
Sincerely,
Linda Stimpson
