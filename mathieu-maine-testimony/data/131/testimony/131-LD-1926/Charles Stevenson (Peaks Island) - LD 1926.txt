Dear Senator Brenner and Representative Gramlich and members of the committee:   My name is C. Ian Stevenson, and I live on Peaks Island. I am writing today to ask you to support:  LD 1926; An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River  I am very concerned about the health of the Presumpscot River both because of its impacts on Casco Bay, where I live, but also because of the recreational, environmental, and educational opportunities it provides for those living in the greater Portland area.  My son has done science experiments and ﬁeld trips to this portion of the river as well as Maine Audubon’s Gilsland Farm with his Peaks Island Elementary School, studying the river’s native ﬁsh, birds, and plant life. Furthermore, I recreationally ﬂy ﬁsh for brook trout on this river and care for its overall health.  This proposed bill will not interfere with current discharge users of the river but future ones, which seems like a fair balance. Thus, this bill allows for growth but also the maintenance of our natural resources. I sincerely urge you to pass this legislation.  Thank you,    C. Ian Stevenson, PhD
