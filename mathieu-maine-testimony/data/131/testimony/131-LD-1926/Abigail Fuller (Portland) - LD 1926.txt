Dear Senator Stacy Brenner, Representative Lori Gramlich and Distinguished 
Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
Please pass LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste 
Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River. The water quality in the lower 
Presumpscot River is improving, enabling wildlife to return and recreational 
activities. In addition, preventing new discharge into the river is vital to protecting the
quality of Casco Bay and the flora and fauna there. This four-year moratorium on new
industrial discharges will preserve the riverâ€™s significant advances in water quality 
while a long term solution is identified. A temporary moratorium allows for continued
operation of existing discharges and will not thwart urban growth. 
Sincerely,
Abigail Fuller
Portland, Maine
