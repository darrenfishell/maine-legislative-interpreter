Dear Senator Stacy Brenner, Representative Lori Gramlich and Distinguished 
Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, 
I am writing to ask that the Environment and Natural Resources Committee vote that 
LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste Discharge 
Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River, be passed.
I am 56 years old and I grew up in Falmouth.  As a kid, we would never have 
dreamed of swimming in the Presumpscot River for fear of getting sick from the 
filthy water.  All these years later, we live on the river and it has been a center of our 
family's entertainment and joy.  Most days I walk our dog on the trails.  (She sits at 
the door and begs until I do!) She swims.  Our kids swim, and swing and float, as do 
all of their friends.  The river is a place of refuge and gratitude and I see people, and 
wildlife, loving it daily it in so many ways - boating, fishing, picnicking, exploring, 
classroom field trips, and simply reading on a rock with toes dangling in the river as 
an eagle swoops by.
Please take the time to research the effects of companies dumping waste into the river 
that not only flows through this incredible, cherished, public resource for year-round 
pleasure, health and well-being, but that flows right into our incredible Casco Bay.  
Sounds kind of insane that it would even be considered after we have come so far and 
with how much we now know about the importance of protecting our precious 
environment.  
Let's keep 'Maine, the way life should be' and pass this Moratorium to learn more 
about how to continue to keep our water safe for all.
Sincerely,
Sally Scribner
