As I sit here at the edge of the river, near the Allen Ave Ext bridge, I reflect on the 
importance of this river to me and my family. We chose to buy our house because of 
the river. We wanted water access to Casco Bay, but the protection of being up river.  
It is a gorgeous location. I have been told about the grotesque history of this river. As 
I look out at the river today, I am so thankful to be able to smell the blooming 
flowers, watch the osprey catch a fish so elegantly, listen to a family walk the trails 
across the river bank and comfortably dip my toes in the rushing water.
We are so lucky to enjoy this river by relaxing along its banks, swimming, paddle 
boarding up to the falls and fly fishing from the left over rocks of the previous dam. 
We have memories of paddle boarding through the thick poggies running up the river 
last spring, canoeing down the river while watching an eagle and her juvenile learn 
skills, watching right from our dock the seal pups learn how to fish from their mom.
My wish is that the river continues to be respected by animal and human alike. Its 
future of health and prosperity to our environment will be a gift to our community. It 
is even more important as it flows into Casco Bay.
Casco Bay is showing significant signs of stress from elevated nitrogen levels. No 
doubt that the waste flowing down the river is an impactful issue to our bay.
I am proud of all the work that has been done over the past decade to make the once 
grotesque river a historical nightmare. Please pass this bill so that you and your family
can enjoy the river and Casco Bay safely with good health in mind going forward in 
our future.
