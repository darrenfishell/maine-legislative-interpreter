LD 1926
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
I am writing to ask that the Environment and Natural Resources Committee vote to 
pass LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point Source Waste 
Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River.
I regularly swim and fish in the Presumpscopt River and would like to continue doing 
so in clean, unpolluted water.  I also boat, fish and swim in Casco Bay where the river
discharges and believe we should protect the waterways and estuarys from further 
pollution.  Water quality has drastically improved over the past decades and efforts 
should be made to preserve and further improve this progress.
Thank you,
Brian Stornelli
