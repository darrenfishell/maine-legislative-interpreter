LD 1926
Dear Fellow Mainers,
I urge you to support: LD 1926, An Act to Impose a Moratorium on New Point 
Source Waste Discharge Licenses on the Lower Presumpscot River. 
The lower Presumpscot River was once known as “the dirtiest little section of river in 
the state.” After years of restoration, today it is a place where people swim and fish!
This bill provides temporary and necessary protection from pollution for the lower 
Presumpscot River by placing a 4-year moratorium on new industrial discharges 
while long-term solutions are identified. 
We need a healthy Presumpscot to have a healthy Casco Bay. Supporting this bill 
builds on our efforts to upgrade the Clean Water Act classification of the lower 
Presumpscot, which remains a long-term goal. 
Thank you for protecting the health of Casco Bay,
