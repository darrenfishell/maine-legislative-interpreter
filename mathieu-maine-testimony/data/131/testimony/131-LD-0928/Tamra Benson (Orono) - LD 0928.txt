LD 928
My name is Tamra Benson and I am a fourth-year student at the University of Maine. 
I am writing as a student, activist, and, concerned citizen, to urge you to vote “ought 
to pass” on LD 928.
I am a firm believer that we are here to heal each other. As a collective, I believe that 
we are here to honor our relationship and responsibility to the land and each other, to 
minimize suffering and maximize authentic joy, and to work for the collective healing
and liberation of the planet and the ecosystems and people that inhabit it.
The Pine Tree Amendment will encourage sustainable and forward-thinking 
development, industry, and business growth, and create a robust legal pathway for 
protecting Maine's ecosystems. This issue is essential to Mainers and the PTA has the 
capacity to make a significant impact in protecting Maine’s environment. It will also 
incentivize government officials to make decisions that will accomplish economic and
business objectives while also protecting water, air, soils, food, forests, wetlands, 
climate, and other natural resources. Our environment is critical to sustaining healthy, 
safe, and successful lives and economies, and Maine’s constitution should reflect that 
fact. 
All people in Maine deserve the right to clean air, clean water, and a healthy 
environment, and they deserve it now. This is truly the bare minimum in terms of 
what people in Maine should have for rights, and yet these rights are not stated or 
protected by Maine’s Constitution. The Pine Tree Amendment would change that, 
ensuring that these constitutionally protected rights are upheld by Maine state and 
local governments.
The Pine Tree Amendment is a powerful way to honor our relationship and 
responsibility to the land and each other, to minimize suffering and maximize 
authentic joy, and to work for the collective healing and liberation of people and the 
planet. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Tamra Benson
