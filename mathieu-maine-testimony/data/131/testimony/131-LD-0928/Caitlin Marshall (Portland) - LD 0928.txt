Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Caitlin Marshall and I live in Portland, Maine. 
I am speaking as a parent to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
As a mother, I know deep in my bones that my most important priority is to provide 
for my kids.  I cannot do that if all of us, and especially those in leadership, fail to 
protect our fundamental right to a healthy, clean environment.  
– Our food supply, the safety of our homes and the stability of our economy all 
necessarily rest on the natural resources of our state.  The Pine Tree Amendment 
offers the hope that my kids (and yours, all our kids!) will have a livable future here 
in Maine.
– The PTA would ensure that all legislatures uphold this right. Laws can be made and 
unmade, but the Constitution is permanent.
– The PTA will strengthen environmental justice by ensuring all communities – 
regardless of race, ethnicity or income – have the same rights to clean water and air.
I care fiercely for my kids.  And I believe all parents do, including those who might 
often oppose environmental legislation.  But the Pine Tree Amendment is a 
bi-partisan bill with broad support.  It accurately reflects our reality today, and is the 
only truly responsible choice in the face of climate chaos.  
We can be cowardly, and pass off increasingly insurmountable challenges to our kids,
or we can face the facts that our resources have limits, and it’s up to us protect them 
for generations to come.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
Respectfully submitted, 
Caitlin Marshall
