In
support
of
the
LD928
:
Proposing
an
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
Maine
to
Establish
a
Right
to
a
Clean
and
Healthy
Environment
Thank
you,
Senator
Stacy
Brenner ,
Representative
Lori
Gramlich,
and
honorable
members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
Environment
and
Natural
Resources.
My
name
is
Angie
T ehuitzil,
I
live
in
Farmington,
Maine,
and
I
am
a
Maine
Y outh
Power
as
a
legislative
fellow ,
a
youth-led,
youth
movement
throughout
rural
and
suburban
Maine
fighting
to
win
human
dignity ,
equity ,
and
a
livable
future
for
all.
I
am
here
today
to
ask
that
you
support
the
LD928:
Proposing
an
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
Maine
to
Establish
a
Right
to
a
Clean
and
Healthy
Environment
(the
Pine
T ree
Amendment
testimony).
Upon
moving
to
Maine
almost
two
years
ago,
I
worried
I'd
miss
the
state
I
grew
up
in
and
the
stunning
outdoors
from
my
long
hikes,
running
trails,
and
camping.
But
during
my
time
in
Maine,
I
have
learned
and
appreciated
the
similar
yet
unique
cultural
identity
of
their
outdoors.
Along
with
others,
I
genuinely
enjoy
living
near
incredible
and
beautiful
natural
landscapes
I've
encountered
in
Maine
from
its
woods,
oceans,
mountains,
lakes,
trails,
etc.
Which
is
why
I
am
ur gently
asking
to
pass
this
bill
to
ensure
no
environmental
harm,
along
with
that
we
conserve
and
protect
the
land
for
future
generations
to
have
healthy
ecosystems.
Maine
must
also
continue
to
provide
clean
natural
resources
such
as
water
and
air
for
the
community's
health.
This
is
especially
important
for
families
that
have
migrated
to
Maine
and
come
from
a
place
where
proper
clean
resources
were
not
available.
Lastly ,
Climate
action
is
highly
substantial
to
youth.
They
have
put
a
lot
of
ef fort
into
encouraging
global
environmental
change
to
preserve
the
beauty
of
the
environment
and
fighting
for
a
clean
state.
This
bill
would
guarantee
the
State
of
Maine
the
right
to
a
clean
and
healthy
environment
and
avoid
any
threat
to
our
state's
natural
resources.
I,
therefore,
encourage
the
committee
to
support
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
