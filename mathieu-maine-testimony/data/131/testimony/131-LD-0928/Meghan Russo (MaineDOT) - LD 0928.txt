________________________________________________________________________  
 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources, my name is Meghan Russo, Manager of Legislative and 
Constituent Services at MaineDOT.  MaineDOT submits this testimony in opposition to LD 928, 
Resolution, Proposing An Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a 
Clean and Healthy Environment.  
The passage of this bill  could have unintended consequences to potentially all MaineDOT 
projects.   As drafted the bill could create  a whirlwind of litigation on any development.   For 
example, the bill reads: “The people of the State have the right to a clean and healthy 
environment and to the preservation of the natural, cultural and healthful qualities of the 
environment. The State m ay not infringe upon these rights. The State shall conserve, protect and 
maintain the State’s natural resources, including, but not limited to, its air, water, land and 
ecosystems for the benefit of all the people, including generations yet to come.”   Due to the 
broadness of this language we believe that its passage could allow any one person or entity who 
opposes a proposed MaineDOT project, anywhere from a bridge replacement, rehabilitation of 
rail lines, construction of a bike path, or port development a nd all points in between, to bring a 
court challenge halting the project.   That opposition could make the argument that the project in 
question infringes upon their right to a clean and healthy environment.   
MaineDOT’s  process, whether dictated by federal  oversight on federally funded projects, or state 
requirements on state funded projects, already requires and allows for significant public 
involvement.   We fully  support a healthy natural environment, and our employees and 
contracting partners design and build infrastructure to support that goal.   Should this 
 
 
 
Constitutional Amendment pass as drafted, we fear that projects could be delayed in court, such 
as what we  recently  experienced  with the Frank J. Wood Bridge replacement project.    
It is for these rea sons we urge the committee to vote in opposition to LD 928.  Thank you.
