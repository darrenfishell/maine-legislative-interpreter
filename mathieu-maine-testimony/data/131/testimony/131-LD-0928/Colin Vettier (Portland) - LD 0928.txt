Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Colin Vettier and I live in Portland. 
I am writing as a concerned citizen to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
For years I have witnessed governements hand in hand with corporation, shortchange 
the people by selling our commons for a handful of cash. This has to stop and our 
right to a clean environment - a right to a future, really - should be a given, not 
something we have to compete for with financial interests. For this reason, I couldn't 
bring myself to bring children into this world were they might not have a future at all.
The PTA ensures that all Mainers have the right to a clean and healthy environment 
for generations to come. 
Our right to a clean and healthy environment should be as fundamental as our right to 
vote.
The PTA would ensure that all Legislatures, Governors, laws, and permits will honor 
the rights we should have to a healthy environment. Laws can be made and unmade, 
but the Constitution is permanent.
No person in Maine, whether today or decades into the future, should have to question
their right to a clean and healthy environment.
Respectfully submitted, 
[Your name]
