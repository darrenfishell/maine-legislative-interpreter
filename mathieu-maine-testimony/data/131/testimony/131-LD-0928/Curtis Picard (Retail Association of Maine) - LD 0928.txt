RE: Testimony  in OPPOSITION to LD 928, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a  Right to a Clean and Healthy Environment  
Dear Senator Brenner,  Representative Gramlich , and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources  Committee:  
My name is Curtis Picard and I am the President and CEO  of the Retail Association of Maine. I 
am a resident of Topsham.  We have more than 350  members statewide and represent retailers 
of all sizes. Maine’s retailers employ more than 85 ,000 Mainers.  
 
I am writing to exp ress our  opposition to the proposed constitutional amendm ent, LD 928,  to 
establish a right to a healthy environment. While I understand the intentions behind this 
proposal, I believe that it would have serious negative consequences for our society and our 
economy.  
 
Firstly, enshrining a right to a healthy environment in t he constitution would create a legal 
framework that is overly vague and difficult to interpret. What exactly would constitute a 
healthy environment? How would this right be balanced against other rights and interests, such 
as property rights or economic de velopment? These questions are difficult to answer, and 
would likely lead to a flood of litigation and uncertainty.   
 
Recently, Maine added a ‘Right to Fo od’ to Maine ’s Constituti on, and there are now concerns 
that it could lead to overturning Maine ’s ban on Sunday hunting. Simply, while the legislative 
process can sometimes be messy, it is a process that allows for inpu t from a variety of 
stakeholder s, discussion, and compr omise. This proposed amendment looks to usurp that 
process.  Our current legal framework already provides protection for the environment through 
various environmental laws and regulations. These laws have been developed over many years 

and are constantly evolving to keep up with changing en vironmental challenges. Therefore, I 
see no need for a constitutional amendment to protect the environment.  
 
Secondly, this proposal could have a chilling effect on economic developme nt and job creation. 
If businesses and industries believe that their activities may be challenged on environmental 
grounds, they may choose to invest elsewhere, leading to a loss of jobs and economic growth. 
While environmental protection is certainly impo rtant, it must be balanced against other 
legitimate societal goals, such as economic prosperity and job creation.  
 
Thirdly, the proposed amendment could have unintended consequences for individual 
freedoms and property rights. For example, if a person's pro perty is deemed to be harming the 
environment, they could be forced to take costly and burdensome measures to remediate the 
situation, or even face expropriation of their property. This would be a serious violation of 
individual rights and could  lead to a number of unintended consequences.  
  
Finally, I believe that individual responsibility and community action are the most effective 
ways to protect the environment. Rather than relying on a constitutional ame ndment, we 
should encourage individuals and communities to take action to reduce their environmental 
impact and advocate for stronger environmental policies at the local and national level.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to share our thought s with you , and we look forward to the 
discussion.  
 
Sincerely,   
 
Curtis Picard, CAE  
President and CEO
