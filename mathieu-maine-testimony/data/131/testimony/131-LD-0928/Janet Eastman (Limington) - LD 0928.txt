LD 928
To: Senator Stacy Brenner and Representative Lori Gramlich and honorable members
of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee.
From : Janet Eastman of Limington, ME
The Pine Tree Amendment (LD 928) is a proposed amendment to the Bill of Rights of the 
Maine Constitution. This bill will guarantee protections for Maine's "air, water, land, and 
ecosystems for the benefit of all the people, including generations to come."
As part of the Constitution, it will require the government to protect the peoples' right to a 
clean and healthy environment.   Just like the Constitution protects our other rights.  Just like 
we would have redress if a constitutional right were not enforced.
To me, this is a principle that will reflect our state's dedication to public health for ALL people. 
It is the bedrock of environmental justice. 
Other states have similar constitutional amendments--Pennsylvania, Montana, and 
New York,  As I understand, proposals are in at least 10 other states currently.
This is our opportunity to stand up for the Environment and to ensure that the 
generations behind us will have a planet that provides them food, air, peace and 
beauty.
Please do the right thing and support this bill.
Many thanks,
Janet Eastman
