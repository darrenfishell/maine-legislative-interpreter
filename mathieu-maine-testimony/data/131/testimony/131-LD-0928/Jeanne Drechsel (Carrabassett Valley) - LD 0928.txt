LD 928
I want to be counted among those opposed to LD 928. 
Transferring environmental protection decisions to a judge, one individual who could 
have his or her personal agenda cloud decisions, is a scary prospect fraught with risks 
of a situation with too much power in one person's hands. 
Our economy in Maine is fragile at best, while forestry and fishing (two of the largest 
contributors to that economy) are being attacked on all sides by environmental 
extremism.
Allowing individuals or groups to challenge in court lawful agency or municipal 
decisions would clog courts and delay indefinitely lawful undertakings by the citizens
of Maine.
Please stop LD 928 here and now.
Thank you.
