Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Fallon Culley and I am a high schooler at Waynflete.
I am writing as a student and Maine citizen to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
I was born and raised in Maine. I grew up searching for frogs in the pond across the 
street. My older brother taught me how to snakes so they wouldn't bite me. I grew up 
with Saturday hikes and summer days spent in lakes and the ocean. Autumns meant 
colorful leaves and fresh, crisp air, and apple picking. In testifying today, I hope to 
encourage the right to a clean environment for all Maine citizens so others can grow 
up as I did. 
Maine relies on the environment for many things: food, enjoyment, and bringing in 
tourists. If Maine is susceptible to polluted air and environments, tourists could 
decrease causing the economy to suffer. Maine needs the pine tree amendment to 
protect the jobs and economy of its citizens. Additionally, the health of Maine citizens
could suffer without a clean air and environment. Hospitals could become 
overwhelmed and the overall quality of Maine life would go down. Finally, us 
Mainers, in the event of a destroyed environment, would not be able to enjoy this 
beautiful state like I have for the past sixteen years.
Respectfully submitted, 
Fallon Culley
