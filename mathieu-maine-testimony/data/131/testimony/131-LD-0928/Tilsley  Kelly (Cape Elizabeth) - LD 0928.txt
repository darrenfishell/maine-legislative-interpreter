Tilsley  Kelly
Cape Elizabeth
LD 928
Hello Representative Rebecca J. Millett, my name is Tilsley Kelly and I am your 
constituent who lives in Cape Elizabeth. Iâ€™m calling in support of the Pine Tree 
Amendment, LD 928, which ensures that all Mainers have the right to a clean and 
healthy environment for generations to come. I care about the PTA because I want my
kids to grow up in a world where we are doing everything we can create a healthy 
environment, so they do not have to worry. I am concerned about water pollution 
because swimming in the ocean and in lakes in Maine is a big part of my life. Thank 
you for your time and I hope you support LD 928.
