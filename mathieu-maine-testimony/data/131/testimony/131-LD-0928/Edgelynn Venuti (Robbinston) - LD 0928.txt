Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Edgelynn Venuti and I live in Robbinston and I go to school in East 
Machias, Maine at Washington Academy. I am writing as a student, activist and a 
concerned young citizen to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
The Pine Tree Amendment ensures that all Mainers have the right to a clean and 
healthy environment for generations to come. Our right to a clean and healthy 
environment should be as fundamental as our right to vote. It is a human right and the 
government should support that. The PTA would ensure that all Legislatures, 
Governors, laws, and permits will honor the rights we should have to a healthy 
environment. Laws can be made and unmade, but the Constitution is permanent.
Part of our Maine identity is about our love for the outdoors- the waterways, the 
woods, and the swimming and hiking and hunting, and fishing that go along with that.
All Mainers- past, present and future- deserve a right to this way of life. After all the 
state motto is - "the way life should be." No person in Maine, whether today or 
decades into the future, should have to question whether they will get to experience a 
clean, healthy safe environment or not. 
Take action to defend the environment, for the future of Maine and everyone in it. 
Support and make sure that LD 928- the Pine Tree Amendment passes. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Edgelynn Venuti
