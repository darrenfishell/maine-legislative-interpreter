As the Communications Coordinator for the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy, 
based in Norway, I strongly support the Pine Tree Amendment for the simple reason 
that the PTA ensures that all Mainers have the right to a clean and healthy 
environment for generations to come.
· The PTA will ensure that all Legislatures, Governors, laws, and permits will honor 
our rights to a healthy environment. Laws can be made and unmade, but the 
Constitution is a more effective way to protect these essential rights.
· The PTA will strengthen environmental justice by ensuring all communities – regardless of 
race, ethnicity, or income – have the same rights to clean water and air and healthy 
environments. It will be the duty of all government officials to protect all communities 
equitably.
· Pennsylvania, Montana, and New York have already passed this kind of environmental 
amendment. They are being used to prevent harmful gold mining operations; advance 
drinking water protections from PFAS contamination; prevent state legislators from raiding 
environmental protection funds; require consideration of science and impacts before 
permitting environmentally damaging operations; secure cleanup of toxic contamination, and 
more.
On behalf of the board and staff of CEBE, we believe we have an
obligation to do our best to protect our environment as occupiers of stolen
land; as farmers; as parents; as fisherpeople; as skiers; as homesteaders; as
humans who are not separate from the natural environment but part of it. Thank you for your 
thoughtful consideration.
