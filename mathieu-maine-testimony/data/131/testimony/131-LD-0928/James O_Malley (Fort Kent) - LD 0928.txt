LD 928
Good morning -
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in opposition to LD 928 - a proposed 
amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to Clean and Healthy 
Environment.
As it's written, this proposal is much too vague and provides little guidance on how it 
would be implemented - this could lead to confusion and potential legal challenges.
This resolution could well result in increased regulations or restrictions of both 
logging and mining. While I have no experience in the mining sector, I've been a 
forester in Maine for more than forty years now - our current laws have proven to 
protect our environment while allowing multiple generations of Mainers earn good 
livelihoods. 
My last concern that I'll share is the potential cost of implementation.  This 
amendment will require new resources to enforce and implement.  Our State doesn't 
need this additional burden.
