RESOLUTION,
Proposing

Amendment

to
Establish

Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
928,
RESOLUTION,
Proposing
an
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
Maine
to
Establish
a
Right
to
a
Clean
and
Healthy
Environment,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members
and
supporters.
Maine
Audubon
is
Maine’ s
oldest
and
lar gest
wildlife
conservation
non-profit.
It’ s
a
common
saying
amongst
our
or ganization
that
“when
Maine’ s
wildlife
thrives,
Maine
thrives”.
The
legions
of
advocates
behind
the
“Pine
T ree
Amendment”
tout
this
extraordinary
policy
ef fort
as
assurance
that
all
Maine
people
will
have
the
right
to
a
clean
and
healthy
environment.
W e
posit
that
under
the
Pine
T ree
Amendment,
“when
Maine
people
thrive,
Maine’ s
wildlife
thrive”.
It
is
in
that
spirit
that
Maine
Audubon
brings
our
support
to
LD
928.
Indeed,
Maine
is
defined
by
its
extraordinary
landscape,
clean
water ,
fresh
air ,
natural
resources,
and
biodiversity .
Protecting
the
health
of
these
resources
is
essential
to
our
collective
well-being
and
prosperity .
Maine
Audubon
is
pleased
to
support
this
legislation.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
