TESTIMONY OF 
MELANIE LOYZIM, COMMISSIONER 
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
SPEAKING NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
L.D. 928 “RESOLUTION, PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION 
OF MAINE TO ESTABLISH A RIGHT TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT ” 
SPONSORED BY REP. O’NEIL 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
HEARING DATE: 
MARCH 22, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Enviromnent and Natural Resources, I am Melanie Loyzim, Commissioner of the Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP), providing this testimony neither for nor against L.D. 928. 
Maine’s natural resources and enviromnental qualities underpin much of our economy 
and culture. A statement in Maine’s Constitution that every citizen has the right to a clean and 
healthy enviromnent would reﬂect Maine’s values. As drafted, L.D. 928 would have no direct 
effect on the laws administered by the Department. Its actual effect would only be established 
through litigation and judicial precedent.

LD 928, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Establish a Right toa 
Healthy Environment 
Testimony of: Melanie Loyzim/ Maine DEP 
Public Hearing: March 22, 2023 
Page 2 of2 
In 2021, a similar resolution with much more detail was introduced as L.D. 489 and 
opposed by the Department. A majority of this Committee voted in support of an amendment to 
L.D. 489, which later failed ﬁnal passage in 2022. That failed amendment is now before you 
again as L.D. 928. 
This constitutional amendment does not modify any statutes or rules governing the 
enviromnental impact of activities in Maine. Its only apparent purpose is to serve as a broad goal 
statement to be cited in objections ﬁled with the judicial branch to activities perceived as 
infringing on the rights provided by this constitutional amendment. The Department cannot 
predict how this would be interpreted by the courts, and therefore has no position on this 
legislation as drafted.
