From: Anna Siegel
Three years ago I summited Mount Katahdin with my dad.  We woke up incredibly 
early on an August morning and threw ourselves onto the Abol Trail, navigating 
massive boulders before the coffee and hot chocolate had kicked in. I didn’t raise my 
head from my muddy boots until we had reached the top with its scraggly wooden 
sign: “Mt. Katahdin: 5,269 feet.” My state seemed as big as the world. A collage of 
fields, roads, woods, and rivers spread out below. It looked fragile from such a great 
height. I am a student who has many years of hiking ahead of me. I want to keep 
exploring, searching, striving for ever higher mountain peaks—and for that, Maine 
needs the Pine Tree Amendment. Amending the Maine Constitution in this way writes
environmental protections into the highest state law and legally solidifies what would 
otherwise be empty words of “sustainability” and “action.” The amendment has a lens
of equity too, as it would protect clean water, clean air, and a healthy environment for 
all people. Spring is on its way, and I think more and more these days about my time 
on Katahdin and the summer hiking to come. I think about my future and what would 
be left of without a healthy environment. As a birder, I also think of oncoming spring 
migration and how it becomes more distorted every year. Natural processes are 
becoming mutated because of anthropogenic climate change. Maine is a haven for 
declining bird species that breed here, and if we protect our clean water and air it will 
stay that way. So as a birder, a hiker, a climate justice activist, a Mainer, and a young 
person trying to make my way through a changing world, I support the Pine Tree 
Amendment and take comfort in how it would safeguard my environmental rights.
Respectfully submitted,
Anna Siegel
