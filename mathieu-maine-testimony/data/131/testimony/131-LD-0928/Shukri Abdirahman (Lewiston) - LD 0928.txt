LD 928: Pine Tree Amendment
Senator Stacy Brenner, Representative Lori Gramlich, and Honorable members of the committee
My name is Shukri Abdirahman and I live in Lewiston Maine. I am a co-director of Maine Youth Power,
a youth-led, youth movement throughout rural and suburban Maine ﬁghting to win human dignity,
equity and a livable future for all. I am here today to ask that you support
LD 928, a Resolution
Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
As a social justice activist, I urge for the passing of this bill. Coming from a background of having no
access to clean and safe water, I am someone who appreciates the safe clean water we have here in
Maine. I support this bill to help protect our precious drinking water and to ensure that our future
generations will have clean safe water to drink. Water is important for survival and therefore a huge
commodity to protect. The Pine Tree Amendment ensures that all the good work that has been done
here in Maine on behalf of the environment will not be rolled back by a future administration or
legislature and will give all people in Maine conﬁdence that future generations will be able to enjoy
the beauty of this place we call home.
I believe all Mainers have the right to a clean and healthy environment for generations to come.
No person in Maine, whether today or decades into the future, should have to question their right to a clean
and healthy environment. Healthy communities need a clean and healthy environment.  The Pine Tree
Amendment will help safeguard our right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
Sincerely,
Shukri Abdirahman
