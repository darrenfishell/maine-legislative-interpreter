Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Environment
and
Natural
Resources:
I
am
submitting
testimony
today
as
a
lifelong
Mainer ,
a
mother ,
and
an
educator .
I
do
not
speak
on
behalf
of
the
University
of
Maine
system,
but
I
do
draw
insights
from
my
decades
of
teaching
in
the
area
of
social
justice
and
social
change.
A
majority
of
people,
in
Maine
and
across
the
country ,
are
fearful
about
the
future
1
.
We
know
we
face
unprecedented
problems
and
we
do
not
believe
we
can
or
will
work
together
to
forge
solutions
that
include
all
of
us.
Instead,
we
imagine
scenarios
where
a
small
number
hoard
resources
and
leave
everyone
else
to
do
the
hardest
work
with
little
chance
of
thriving.
Stories
of
our
incapacity
or
unwillingness
to
cooperate
have
taken
root
more
than
the
stories
of
remarkable
collective
action
for
justice
and
change.
We
have
a
chance
to
change
the
narrative,
and
the
reality
for
many ,
with
the
passage
of
the
Pine
Tree
Amendment
.
My
students
sometimes
express
a
sense
of
nihilism
–
even
trying
to
make
a
change
for
the
better
seems
pointless
given
the
levels
of
corruption
they
perceive
in
business,
Government,
and
throughout
our
communities.
Others
advocate
for
individual
action,
but
grow
angry
when
they
compare
the
yield
of
their
work
to
give
up
“fast
fashion”
and
single
use
plastic
in
comparison
to
the
carbon
released
by
private
jets
leaving
the
Super
Bowl
.
Many
advocate
not
giving
up
–
they
acknowledge
that
the
work
is
hard
and
the
odds
may
be
low,
but
they
see
the
value
of
trying.
These
students
show
up
to
groups
like
Maine
Youth
for
Climate
Justice
and
generate
new
ideas,
like
the
Pine
Tree
Amendment.
I
am
in
this
camp
–
increasingly
fearful
as
I
track
the
ecological
changes
in
my
favorite
places,
but
not
ready
to
throw
in
the
towel
on
a
liveable
future
for
all
of
us.
I
believe
most
in
Maine
are
right
there
with
me
-
we
are
not
quitters.
I
a
submitting
testimony
today
as
a
parent
and
educator ,
concerned
about
the
well
being
of
today’ s
young
people
and
committed
to
partnering
with
them
as
we
forge
ahead
into
uncertain
climate
conditions.
It
would
be
so
much
if
our
elected
leaders
make
a
similar
commitment
–
we
will
not
simply
pass
our
problems
onto
them
by
delaying
action.

A
2021
study
2
quantified
the
emotional
burden
that
youth
are
carrying,
as
they
live
with
the
consequences
of
climate
catastrophes
that
infringe
on
their
current
and
future
security ,
“
Respondents
across
all
countries
were
worried
about
climate
change
(59%
were
very
or
extremely
worried
and
84%
were
at
least
moderately
worried).
More
than
50%
reported
each
of
the
following
emotions:
sad,
anxious,
angry ,
powerless,
helpless,
and
guilty .
More
than
45%
of
respondents
said
their
feelings
about
climate
change
negatively
affected
their
daily
life
and
functioning,
and
many
reported
a
high
number
of
negative
thoughts
about
climate
change
(eg,
75%
said
that
they
think
the
future
is
frightening
and
83%
said
that
they
think
people
have
failed
to
take
care
of
the
planet).“
58%
of
American
youth
said
they
feel
anxious,
54%
afraid,
and
46%
reported
feeling
helpless
about
their
futures.
Only
24%
of
respondents
from
the
United
States,
and
only
30%
of
young
people
world
wide,
feel
optimistic
about
the
future.
These
statistics
challenge
our
narrative
that
“the
kids
will
save
us”
or
that
“the
kids
are
alright.”
They
challenge
our
national
story
of
faith
in
“a
better
future”.
Maine’ s
own
data
on
adolescent
well-being
shows
an
even
more
disturbing
trend.
According
to
the
2021
Maine
Integrated
Youth
Health
Survey
3
,
49%
of
high
school
students
and
45
%
of
middle
school
students
believe
they
do
not
matter
in
the
communities
where
they
live.
Less
than
half
of
high
school
students
experience
support
from
adults
who
are
not
their
parents.
Again,
we
have
a
chance
to
step
up,
to
be
the
adults
students
look
toward
for
support.
The
IPCC
report
4
released
on
March
20th
2023
amplifies
all
of
these
anxieties.
Young
people
are
not
wrong
to
worry
that
adults
in
power
will
make
short
term
decisions
that
fail
to
take
their
needs
into
account.
Let’s
show
them
another
way!
The
passage
of
the
Pine
Tree
Amendment
is
not
a
promise
that
our
climate
emergency
will
be
solved,
or
that
we
will
necessarily
find
solutions
everyone
agrees
with.
Instead,

it’s
a
communication
to
our
Government
that
we
expect
good-faith
effort
to
create
policy
that
prioritizes
our
collective
survival
–
clean
air,
water
and
soil
-
and
that
we
will
not
make
decisions
or
allocate
resources
that
presumes
there
is
a
clean-up-crew
coming
in
the
shape
of
our
kids,
grandkids
and
great-grandkids.
It
is
a
communication
to
our
kids
that
we
are
listening,
that
we
will
not
abandon
them
for
our
short-term
gain,
that
we
are
not
leaving
anyone
behind
as
we
navigate
the
uncertainties
ahead.
Your
vote
for
the
Pine
Tree
Amendment
will
send
it
out
to
ratification,
engaging
Mainers
in
a
very
necessary
conversation
about
the
future
we
wish
to
create
with
each
other .
Help
move
us
beyond
fear
and
cynicism
and
toward
enacting
our
genuine
commitment
to
a
liveable
future
for
all
of
us.
