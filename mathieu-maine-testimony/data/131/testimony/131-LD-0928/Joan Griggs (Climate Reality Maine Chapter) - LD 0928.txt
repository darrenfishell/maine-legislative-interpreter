The Maine Chapter of Climate Reality supports LD 928 The Pine Tree Amendment. The Maine 
Chapterâ€™s members reside in cities and small towns and rural areas across the state, from Lovell to 
Eastport and from Desert Island to Caribou.  They participate in all types of occupation and have 
been focused on educating their communities about the real effects of climate change on Maine life 
and helping those communities to be resilient.
We recognize that climate change can exacerbate existing inequalities in our population; causing 
the negative impact of climate change to weigh most heavily on people of color, indigenous peoples, 
and low-income families and communities.  
The proposed PTA amendment ensures that Maine will create policies and actions that protect 
against the negative health or economic impacts of climate change and development on all its 
citizens. Everyone will have the same rights to clean water and air and healthy environments. The 
PTA makes clear that it is the duty of all officials at every level of government to protect all 
communities.
