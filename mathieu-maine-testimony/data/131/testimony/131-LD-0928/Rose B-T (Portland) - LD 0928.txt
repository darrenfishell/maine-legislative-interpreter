Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Rose and I live and go to school in Portland Maine.
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
I grew up on a farm in Wells Maine with my big family and many animals. In the 
summers I always live on an island in Casco Bay. Both of these places have always 
been very important to me and because of their close connections to the Maine 
environment, I strongly believe they should be maintained for years to come.
Healthy communities need a clean and healthy environment.  The Pine Tree Amendment will 
help safeguard our right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
Part of the Maine identity is the environment and the community around it, The Pine Tree 
Amendment will keep this intact. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Rose
