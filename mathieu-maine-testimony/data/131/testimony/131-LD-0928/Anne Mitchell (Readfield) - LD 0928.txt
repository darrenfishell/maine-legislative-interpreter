LD 928
To:  Committee on Environment and Natural Resources
Re:  LD 928 "Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish 
a Right to a Clean and Healthy Environment."
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources.  I appreciate this opportunity to present my comments 
in OPPOSITION to LD928.  
This proposed amendment to our state Constitution is flawed from the get-go in its vague 
wording and lack of clarity.  The use of terms like “clean and healthy” and “natural, cultural 
qualities” are highly subjective and left to individual interpretation. There is no legal clarity in 
these terms if such decisions are left to one individual, a judge who may have her or his own 
interpretation. 
We Maine people treasure our beautiful environment.  We have a long history of protecting 
our natural resources through regulatory agencies that oversee the use of our air, water, and 
land.  Our state and municipal regulatory agencies are elected officials who represent all the 
people.  If such decisions were left to one appointed judge, power is taken away from the 
Maine people. 
This proposed amendment is designed specifically to bypass the usual process of creating 
and enacting environmental regulations, and that includes the work before this committee.   
Individuals and groups who don’t want to go through the usual legal route to enact public 
policy will use this amendment to bypass the Legislature and thus take that power away from 
the Maine people. 
With our strong, specific environmental regulations and representative agencies already in 
place, LD 928 is unneeded and would be a dangerous change to our constitution. 
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 928. Thank you.
