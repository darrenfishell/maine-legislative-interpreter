Maine Immigrants' Rights Coalition
LD 928
Dear Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee:
My name is Tobin Williamson and I work for the Maine Immigrants' Rights 
Coalition, a statewide network of almost 100 member organizations working to 
enhance the lives of Maine's immigrant communities.
It is our understanding that LD 928 "will strengthen environmental justice by ensuring
all communities – regardless of race, ethnicity, or income – have the same rights to 
clean water and air and healthy environments" and make it "the duty of all 
government officials to protect all communities equitably."
As an organization who wholeheartedly supports the idea of environmental justice, 
we encourage you to pass LD 928.
Thank you for your consideration.
