Re: Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Lily West and I go to school at Freeport High School in Freeport Maine.
I am writing as a student to urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 928.
The climate is entering a new phase as we speak. We have already done enough 
damage that as a young person, my hope often feels futile. I come to you today not 
with a message of positives or negatives.  I will not preach destruction nor complete 
security of the future but instead I ask that you seek to hear the feeling I am writing 
of. What does it feel like, to you all, to know that the earth you are passing down for 
us to watch over, is dangerously over polluted, overpopulated and managed without 
care for the people that live here? What is the feeling of loving the world around you, 
and then watching others see money where you see flowers? See oil and industry 
where you see arctic and sea life? For me, it hurts beyond what I can describe in these
words. For this reason I ask you all to support the Pine Tree Amendment. There is so 
much community support for the PTA it’s truely incredible to watch. We need the 
PTA to lay the foundation on which real climate action can happen. I am relying on 
your ability to work together to ensure that we all have the right to the basic 
necessities in life. Clean air, clean water, and a clean environment in Maine.
Respectfully submitted,
