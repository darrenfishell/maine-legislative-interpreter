LD 928
LD 928 ought-NOT-to pass. While it is a noble goal to protect the natural resources of
Maine, changing the constitution could and would likely result in citizens having to 
give up other rights under the constitution including ownership of property use of 
natural resources. 
It is best to discuss these issues on a case by case bases in order to determine what is 
acceptable to the people of this state.
Thank you.
