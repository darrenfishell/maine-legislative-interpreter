LD 928
Testimony in Support of LD 928, a Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Healthy Environment
My name is Natasha Mayers and I live in Whitefield, a town where sludge was spread
in the 90's and my neighbors can't drink their water. 
As an artist, mother, grandmother, nature lover, I hope you will vote “ought to pass” 
on LD 928, to ensure that we shall have the right to a clean and healthy environment 
way into the future. Protecting the health of our land and water and wildlife is 
essential to our Maine identity, our well-being and prosperity. The PTA will 
strengthen environmental justice by ensuring all communities – regardless of race, 
ethnicity or income – have the same rights to clean water and air and healthy 
environments. It is the duty of all government officials to protect all communities 
equitably.
Maine must pass this kind of environmental amendment, like Pennsylvania, Montana and 
most recently New York have done to prevent harmful mining operations, protect water and 
land from PFAS contamination, require consideration of impacts before permitting 
environmentally damaging operations, secure cleanup of toxic contamination, and more.
Thank you for conserving and protecting our future.
