Testimony LD928
Senator Stacy Brenner, Representative Lori Gramlich, and Honorable members of the 
Environment and Natural Resources committee, my name is Joan Saxe and I reside in 
Freeport. I am testifying today in support of LD928 2023-2024 RESOLUTION, Proposing 
an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to a Clean and Healthy 
Environment.
 As a retired Maine Recreational Guide, a life long advocate for environmental protection 
and a grandmother who recognizes the dangers of the climate crises we are in, I feel, of all 
the bills before the 131st legislature this is the one that stands out as  a must pass.  
The IPCC said yesterday the planet has “one last chance to shift course” A wide 
array of renewable energy solutions, as well as adaptation and mitigations will be 
necessary to shift the course.  The state of Maine already has an abundance of 
companies and industries that want to be first in line to exploit our natural resources 
toshift the course. This bill enshrined in the constitution will protect our rights, the 
Commons and natural resources from  mismanagement.
 
I understand Montana has passed such legislation.  If Montana can do it, so can 
Maine!
Please, for my grandchildren and yours vote:
Ought to PASS.
 
Respectfully submitted,
