I have a camp on Meddybemps Lake where I have been going my whole life (72 
years). I lived there full time for 7 years but now just 6 months a year……just like the
loons. I participate in the Annual Loon Count every year and although our counts 
have remained steady, not many if any chicks are counted. Eventually that lack of 
chicks will show in the count. Loons with lead poisoning do not rear chicks or even 
produce eggs so it is imperative that we all do everything we can to reduce lead in the 
environment. It is not that hard to do! Please pass this bill to keep our loons from 
getting exposed to lead.
