Challenge to all aspects of the environment are massive and often insurmountable.  
This bill to further protect loons from exposure to lead is one straightforward means 
to limit risks to these birds with little hardship or inconvenience to humans.  I believe 
the strengthening of prohibitions on lead is a tangible way to keep Maine's loon 
population from declining.
As a property owner on a pond in southern Maine I have observed many threats to 
loons.  The pair in residence produced only few chicks in the twenty years I have 
lived on this pond.  I have witnessed the destruction of eggs and killing of chicks by 
predators.  Three years ago one of the pair was killed.  Several years ago I discovered 
a dead loon on the shore with no visible sign of attack and suspected it could have 
been a death due to lead poisoning.
Even if loons were not the beloved bird of Maine and the archetypal symbol of the 
state's wild identity, they must be protected in any ways possible.  Limiting lead jigs 
of all types is one uncomplicated way to do this.
