LD 958
I am in favor of LD 958 to expand protections to Maine Loons from lead poisoning. 
My husband and I have owned lake front property in Maine for over 30 years and in 
that time we have been alarmed at the decreasing number of loons on the lake. We 
know that lead poisoning is impacting the population on our lake because the lake 
association has had bodies of the dead loons analyzed. 
Currently, I am a board member of the North Pond Association in Smithfield, ME.
It is frustrating to know that loons are dying from something that is preventable. 
I urge lawmakers to support bill LD 958 and prohibit the sale and use of painted lead 
jigs. Thank you.
