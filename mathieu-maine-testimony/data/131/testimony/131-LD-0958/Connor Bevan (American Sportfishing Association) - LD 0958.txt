 Re: LD  958, An Act to Expand Protections to Maine's Loons from Lead Poisoning by Prohibiting the Sale 
and Use of Certain Painted Lead Jigs  
 
Dear Chair LaFountain, Chair Landry, and Members of the Committee :  
 
The undersigned organizations, representing thousands of anglers in Maine , and tens of thousands 
nationally, strongly oppose  LD 958, which would ban the use and sale of painted lead jigs in Maine’s 
waters. The bill would ban  traditional, commonly used tackle which has been sold and used across the 
state of Maine for decades. Given that it remains unclear if  painted lead jigs  are even toxic for loons, and 
the fact that Maine loon  populations continue to increase in size despite the current use of painted jigs by 
anglers, banning the use of painted led jigs will not address any identified, science -based need. We 
encourage the members of the Committee to oppose this legislation.  
Several studies[1,2] have found that there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the use of lead tackle in 
recreational fishing has adverse impacts on loons and swans at the population level. Loon populations are 
stable or increasing throughout their range and are assessed as a species of least concern by the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature .3 Furthermore, Maine Audubon’s annual loon count 
shows a progressive recovery of the state’s loon population over the past four decades .4 As wildlife is 
managed by state fish and wildlife agencies on the population- level , there is no scientific evidence that 
suggests that painted lead jigs  impact loons  beyond isolated, individual instances . 
A ban on the sale and use of  painted lead jigs would be detrimental not only to Maine’s economy as a 
whole, but to  funding for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (DIFW) as well. 
Through the unique “user pa ys – public benefits” approach of the American System of Conservation 
Funding, state agencies like the DIFW derive significant portions of their funding through license sales and excise taxes on outdoor goods such as fishing rods , motorboat fuel and tackle  such as painted lead 
jigs. The bans proposed by LD 958 would mandate anglers switch to costlier  tackle alternatives, 
discouraging the purchasing of a fishing license  as well as other sportfishing goods.

In 2019, the sale of fishing licenses alone provided the  DIFW  with more than $ 8.34 million, and the 2023 
Maine apportionment from excise taxes revenues provided an additional $4.24 million.[5,6] Banning 
painted jig heads creates a barrier to participation that jeopardizes  this crucial  conservation funding.  
On behalf of the  following organizations , we urge  the Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife  to 
oppose the passage of LD 958 . As there is no scientific evidence that suggest painted lead jigs  impact the 
health of the common loon population, legislation to ban the sale and use of popular, traditional tackle is 
unwarranted. The consequences of unnecessary regulations forcing anglers to purchase new, more costly alternatives may discourage participation in recreational fishing, leadi ng to declining revenues for the 
DIFW and fewer resources for conservation. Thank you for your consideration and for the opportunity to 
comment  on this proposal.  
Sincerely,
