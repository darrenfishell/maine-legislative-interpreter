James Cote
Maine Professional Guides Association 
LD 958
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and members of the committee, my name
is James Cote and I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the Maine Professional 
Guides Association neither for nor against LD 958. 
First, the Maine Professional Guides Association is a strong supporter of the State’s 
loon conservation efforts, and we recognize the impacts that certain lead tackle can 
have on loons. 
Having said that, the MPGA Fishing Committee is also concerned about the 
availability of alternative painted and non-painted lead-free tackle, and question 
whether the length and weight thresholds contained in LD 958 may be overly 
conservative specific to painted tackle. 
MPGA represents hundreds of fishing guides and our goal is to ensure maximum 
effectiveness while at the same time doing right by Maine’s loon population. We urge
the committee to consider and balance the dynamics associated with these objectives 
as you make decisions in regard to LD 958. 
Thank you for your consideration.
