Hello Legislators, thank you for your service --
Lead poisoning remains a leading cause of death in loons and eagles in Maine and 
elsewhere.  
Please close the loophole and prohibit the use of certain lead jigs or weighted hooks. 
Current law allows the use of painted jigs but bans use of unpainted, "bare" lead jigs 
weighing one once or less and measuring 2.5 inches or less in length.
