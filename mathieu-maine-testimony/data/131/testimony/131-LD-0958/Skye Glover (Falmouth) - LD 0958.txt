LD 958
Dear Committee Members,
Loons are amazing, beautiful creatures, and are a symbol of Maine. I am 13 years 
old. I have grown up seeing them and hearing them and watching them, and it 
horrifies me to know that they are in danger. If there is a way to help them, and we 
take the easier route, that is a betrayal of what humans are as a species. We build up, 
we create, and we admire. I canâ€™t control what happens today, but know that there are 
people watching you, that will base their future decision off of what you do.
I hope you will support LD 958.
Sincerely, Skye Glover
