THE MAINE SENATE 
13 1 st Leglslature 
Testimony of Senator Richard Bennett 
before the J olnt Standmg Commlttee on Health and Human Services 
LD 1753, “An Act to Establ1sh an Independent Ad]ud1catory Process Regardrng the Department of 
Health and Human Servrces ” 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Baldaccr, Representatlve Meyer, and esteemed members of the J o1nt Standrng Commrttee on 
Health and Htunan Servlces I am Senator Rrck Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of servlng 14 
commumtres 1n Western Marne 1n the State Senate I am pleased to rntroduce LD 1753, “An Act to 
Estabhsh an Independent AdJud1catory Process Regardlng the Department of Health and Human 
Servrces” 
Th1s b11l 1s modeled after a New Hampsh1re ’s Adm1n1strat1ve Appeals Un1t (AAU) law The New 
Hampshlre AAU 1s lndependent of DHHS Program D1v1s1ons It has a m1ss1on to conduct 1mpart1al 
hearlngs and render dec1s1ons Any 1nd1v1dual or orgamzatlon d1ssat1s ﬁed w1th any matter w1th1n the 
]ur1sd1ct1on of DHHS may request an adm1n1strat1ve appeal hearmg 
I have heard from numerous constrtuents who have ser1ous d1sagreements w1th dec1s1ons reached by 
the Department of Health and Human Serv1ces When they appeal the Department ’s dec1s1ons, the 
Department oversees the appeal Desp1te berng an 1nterested party, they are oversee1ng themselves 
For example, one of my constltuents has formed a fr1endsh1p w1th a young man wrth severe d1sab1l1t1es 
and he moved 1n to an apartment connected to her home They both en] oyed the arrangement but, after 
a number of years, the woman determlned that she could no longer afford to keep h1m W1th her w1thout 
some rermbursement from the State Havlng suffered from physrcal and sexual abuse by men 1n the 
past, he does not Want to l1ve 1n a group home He wants to l1ve w1th her and she wants h1m to l1ve 
w1th her She has recently become certlﬁed as a caretaker 
It has been an extremely arduous process dealrng w1th the Department After re] ectmg h1s Med1ca1d 
serv1ces for a year, DHHS has ﬁnally been forced, by the Mame Probate Court, to remove the 
admlmstratrve barrrers that depr1ved hnn access to h1s dedrcated HCB fund1ng 
But 1t doesn’t end there Medlcal assessments determrne that he needs care 24/7 (168 hours a week) but 
the Department says that they W111 only pay for 112 hours a week and that 1f he changes to a group 
home, they w1ll pay for the 168 hours per week If he 1s to rema1n1n hrs home, he 1s supposed to find 
someone to “volunteer ” the rema1n1ng 56 hours a Week Nobody wants to do th1s so he st1ll cannot 
return to h1s home 
I would l1ke to see a truly rndependent appeals process Where a th1rd party oversees these appeals 
Partres w1th a vested rnterest should not be the sole arb1ters of a statute’s rnterpretatlon 
The current system essent1al1y has the fox guardrng the hen house

LD 1753 requ1res that, 1n an ad_|ud1catory proceedlng regardmg the Department of Health and Human 
Servrces, the Attomey General must appomt the pres1d1ng ofﬁcer from a 11st of qual1ﬁed persons, who 
l Must be l1censed attorneys or knowledgeable 1n health and human servlces law, 
2 Must enter 1nto a contract w1th the Attorney General, 
3 May not be an employee of a state agency or have a personal or professronal conﬂlct that 
would prevent the person from bemg fa1r and 1mpart1al, 
4 Must attend per1od1c tra1n1ng sessrons 1n health and human servrces pract1ces and law, 
,5 Does not have a cl1ent1nvolved 1n a health and human servrces matter 1n the State, and 
6 May not presrde over a matter 1n wh1ch there 1s a party who the person represented w1th1n 
the pr1or 12 months or who employed the person w1th1n the pr1or 3 years 
In 1ts next term, the U S Supreme Court 1s expected to reconsrder the long held precedent from the 
1984 case of Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Counczl Chevron deference 1s a pr1nc1ple of 
adm1n1strat1ve law requ1r1ng courts to defer to lnterpretatrons made by the government agenc1es 
charged w1th enforcrng them, unless such 1nterpretat1ons are unreasonable 
In recent years, the h1gh court has taken up a ser1es of cases that seemed to spell doom 
for Chevron deference, but has stepped back from the brmk each t1me However, most of the cases 
managed to brush back the regulators by reJect1ng the1r legal mterpretatlons In the last s1x years, 
agenc1es lost 70 percent of Supreme Court cases that addressed Chevron In 2020, Justrce Clarence 
Thomas wrote, “Chevron 1s 1n serrous tensron w1th the Constrtutron” 
S1m1larly, Auer v Robb1ns 1s a 1997 Supreme Court case that courts should accept an agency’s 
1nterpretat1on of 1ts own ambrguous regulatron unless that 1nterpretat1on 1s clearly erroneous, 
unreasonable, or ﬂatly 1ncons1stent w1th the text of the regulat1on 
In a 2019 case, Kzsor v Wzlkze, the op1n1on of the court narrowed the l1m1tat1ons of Auer so that 1t only 
krcks 1n when a regulat1on 1s “genumely ambrguous ” and explamed that stare deczszs 1s the reason 1t 
should not be overruled 
In a concurrence to Kzsor, Justrce Gorsuch Wrote “Th1s rule creates a systemat1c ]ud1c1a1 bras 1n favor 
of the federal government, the most powerful of partles, and agarnst everyone else A leglon of 
academ1cs, lower court Judges, and Members of th1s Court—even Auer’s author—has called on us to 
abandon Auer” 
In oppos1t1on to thls b1ll, the Department ra1ses several questrons and concerns I beheve these may be 
addressed 1n the model I proposed and would be vv1l11ng to consrder amend1ng the language If New 
Hampshlre has an Independent system that comphes w1th federal law, there 1s no reason that Marne 
cannot as well Add1t1onally, there 1s no need to use pnvate contractors for th1s change We could 
transfer the current system to be under the superv1s1on of the Attorney General 
It 1s a senous threat to the separatlon of powers to have one branch oversee1ng ltself 
Thank you I would be happy to answer any questrons
