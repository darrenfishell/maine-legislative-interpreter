1nd1v1duals to serve as p1‘6Sld1I1g ofﬁcers for adm1n1strat1ve hearmgs regardmg the Department

as heanng ofﬁcers 
I w1ll p1‘OV1d6 some background on the ex1stmg admlmstratlve appeals process and then focus on 
concerns regardlng the blll 
The D1v1s1on of Adm1n1strat1ve Hear1ngs handles all adm1n1strat1ve appeals of DHHS dec1s1ons 
We are not assoclated W1th any of the serv1ce-prov1d1ng Ofﬁces w1th1n the Department and are 
under the purv1ew of the Comm1ss1oner ’s Ofﬁce We conduct hearmgs pursuant to the 
Admmlstratwe Procedure Act and the Department ’s Admmlstratlve Hear1ng Regulatlons (10- 
144 CMR Ch 1) Hearmg Ofﬁcers are requtred to be l.1I1lI)l3.S €d and to have no pnor mvolvement 
1n the dec1s1on bemg appealed The P3111168 are not allowed to have contact w1th the Hearmg 
Ofﬁcer wlthout the other party be1ng present Hear1ngs are conducted under a de novo I'6V16W 
standard Facts are determlned anew There 1s no presumptlon made for or agamst the 
Department Testnnony 1s submltted under oath SL1l'J_]6ClI to cross-exam1nat1on The appellant may 
call h1s or her own w1tnesses or subpoena w1tnesses 1f he or she WlSl'16S The Hearmg Ofﬁcer 1s 
requ1red to 1ssue an mdependent d6ClS1Ol ’l wlthout deference to the act1on bemg appealed 
Hearmg Oﬁicers do not rubber stamp Department dec1s1ons Hearmg Officers reverse 
Department dec1s1ons every tune 1t 1s warranted 
For most appeals, the Hearmg Ofﬁcer 1SSl16S a ﬁnal dec1s1on, wh1ch constltutes ﬁnal agency 
actron The appellant can further appeal to the Super1or Court For some matters, the
\ 
COl'I1I1'1lSS1Ol'16I ‘ reserves ﬁnal dec1s1on-makmg authonty Such matters mclude gr1evances, ch1ld 
and adult protect1ve substant1at1ons for abuse or neglect, MameCare nurs1ng fac1l1ty el1g1b1l1ty, 
aud1ts, and certam l1cens1ng act1ons For these matters, the Heanng Ofﬁcer lSS116S a 
Recommended Dec1s1on to the Comm1ss1oner The partles are typ1cally glven twenty days to 
subm1t except1ons and responses to the Recommended Dec1s1on The Recommended Dec1s1on 
and any except1ons and responses are then subm1tted to the Commlssloner, who makes the ﬁnal 
dec1s1on If the Comm1ss1oner upholds the Recommended Dec1s10n, then the appellant can 
appeal to the Supenor Court 
The Department 1s Sllb_]6C1Z to a number of drfferent federal requ1rements regardmg adm1n1strat1ve 
hear1ngs Under federal Med1ca1d regulatlons, the Department 1s responslble for determmmg 
el1g1b1l1ty for all 1nd1v1duals applymg for or recezvmg beneﬁts, as well as for prov1d1ng fa1r 
hearmgs 42 C F R § 431 l0(b)(3) Although these regulatlons contemplate that the Department 
may delegate author1ty to conduct fa1r hear1ngs, 1t may do so only to “a government agency 
whlch mamtams personnel standards on a merlt basrs ” 42 C F R § 431 10 (c)(2) Identlcal 
requ1rements extend to appeals of transfers and dlscharges from Med1care and Med1ca1d nursmg 
fac1l1t1es 42 C F R §§ 438 200, 483 204 
In a s1m1lar veln, federal regulat1ons perta1n1ng to SNAP requ1re that hear1ng ofﬁcers meet 
certa1n enumerated cr1ter1a wh1ch would not be poss1ble under th1s b1ll 1 
7 C F R §273 15(m) 
TANF regulatlons, 1n tum, requlre that hearmg be held before the Department by elther an 
ofﬁclal or a desrgnee of the Department 45 C F R § 205 10 Were th1s b1ll to pass, the 
Department would be unable to meet these federal requnements Jeopardlzmg federal fundmg for 
these and other essentral serv1ces 
As I ment1oned, we handle all adm1n1strat1ve hear1ngs for DI-IHS Hearmg Ofﬁcers are requrred 
to know a WlCl6 vanety of state and federal rules and laws Hearmg Ofﬁcers tmdergo an 
extens1ve tra1n1ng process Our appeals 1nclude, but are not l1m1ted to, the followmg areas Chlld 
support establ1shment and enforcement, TANF el1g1b1l1ty, SNAP el1g1b1l1ty, ASPIRE, Intent1onal 
program v1olat1ons for TANF, SNAP, and Ma1neCare, Ma1neCare el1g1b1l1ty, Ma1neCare 
beneﬁts, nurslng home dlscharges, res1dent1al care fac1l1ty dlscharges, L1cens1ng and CDC 
enforcement, WIC term1nat1on hearmgs, Intellectual d1sab1l1ty serv1ces el1g1b1l1ty, Ch1ld 
protectlve substant1at1ons, Adult protect1ve substant1at1ons, CNA reg1stry annotat1ons, ch1ld care 
l1cens1ng revocatlons, Mental health gnevances regardmg the Department and other pnvate 
ent1t1es, Intellectual d1sab1l1ty gr1evances regardlng the Department and other pnvate ent1t1es, 
audlts of Ma1neCare provlders, and Involuntary Med1cat1on Heanngs 
Dunng the pandemlc, there was a reductlon 1n hearmgs due to the federal COVID-19 rel1ef laws 
Under the CARES act, the Department was not allowed to termmate most MameCare el1g1b1l1ty 
unt1l the Pubhc Health Emergency ended The Department 1s now start1ng the “unwlndmg ” 
process, at wh1ch pomt we expect these appeals to 1ncrease In 2019, the last full year before the 
‘ These requnements are as follows “The heanng ofﬁclal shall be (1) An employee of the State agency, (11) An 
1X1Cl1Vldl13.l under contract w1tl1 the State agency, (111) An employee of another publ1c agency deslgnated by the State 
agency to conduct hearmgs, (1v) A member or ofﬁclal of a statutory board or other legal entlty deslgnated by the 
State agency to conduct heanngs, or (v) An execut1ve officer of the State agency, a panel of ofﬁclals of the State 
agency or a person or persons expressly appomted to conduct State level heanngs or to l'6Vl6W State and/or local 
level hearmg dec1s1ons ” 7 C F R § 273 15(m)

pandemlc, We had 1,770 hearmgs scheduled For 2023, We are already on track to have more 
than 1,000 hearmgs scheduled and We have not started recetvmg Ma1neCare el1g1b1l1ty appeals 
We do not antlclpate rece1v1ng those unt1l June For the next ﬁscal year, I antrcrpate we W111 be 
seemg numbers that are more reﬂectrve of the status quo before the pandemrc 
Federal regulatrons not only l1m1t who can hold adm1n1strat1ve hearlngs, but they also govern 
how soon a dec1s1on must be rssued There are a multltude of federal regulatrons Wrth drfferent 
deadlmes for dlfferent programs For WIC beneﬁcrary appeals, dec1s1ons must be lssued W1th1n 
45 days of the appeal request Th1s means that the hearmg must be scheduled, held, anda 
dec1s1on rssued w1th1n 45 days of when the Department recerved the appeal Under SNAP rules, 
a ﬁnal dec1s1on must generally be lssued W1th1n 60 days of the appeal request The federal 
govemment does audrts of the Department to ensure that the Department 1s rssumg tnnely 
dec1s1ons 1n SNAP cases Federal Med1ca1d regulatlons also have requ1rements regardmg 
hearrngs In general, Med1ca1d regulatlons requrre a dec1s1on to be rssued Wrthm 90 days of an 
appeal bemg requested Med1ca1d also requrres that there be a process to handle expedrted appeal 
requests In the event of an expedrted appeal request, a dec1s1on must be rssued wrthm 7 worklng 
days of the expedrted appeal request Th1s rs a trght trmehne, and the Department faces 
consequences 1f federal regulatrons are not met Federal funds are at r1sk 1f federal regulatlons 
are not followed 
State laws and regulat1ons also rmpose some trght deadl1nes For example, Ch1ldren ’s Behav1oral 
Health Servrces grlevances are expedrted Unless deadlmes are Walved, hearmgs must be held 
wrthm 5 days of recerpt of the gnevance, and the dec1s1on must be rssued wrthm 7 days of the 
recelpt of the gnevance Nursmg facrlrty transfer appeals requlre a dec1s1on w1th1n 3 workrng 
days of the hearrng Ch1ld support decrsrons are generally due Wrthm 30 days of hearmg 
In general, state and federal requ1rements typrcally requlre a dec1s1on to be lssued w1th1n 60 to 90 
days of the appeal bemg requested There are vanous types of cases that requ1re expedlted 
appeals, whrch mrght requlre a dec1s1on to be 1ssued w1thm 7 days of an appeal bemg requested 
Currently, the D1v1s1on ofAdmm1strat1ve Hearmgs has 8 Hearmg Officers (1nclud1ng the Chlet) 
and 3 secretanes Hearmg requests need to be recelved, tracked, and scheduled Hearmgs are 
scheduled by phone, by vrdeo, and 1n person F1l6S need to be securely ma1nta1ned, stored, and 
archrved Subpoena requests need to be recerved and ruled upon Smce Admmlstratlve appeals 
mvolve sens1t1ve conﬁdentral matenals, the Department 1s requ1red to follow HIPAA and other 
federal and state conﬁdentrallty laws 
There are a number of concems about th1s brll If LD 1753 1s enacted, who 1s gomg to momtor 
the contractors ‘? Who rs gomg to schedule the hear1ngs ‘7 Where are the hearmgs gomg to be held‘? 
If hearlngs are to be held 1n DI-IHS ofﬁces, who 1s reservmg space? If the heanngs are bemg 
done by telephone, how 1s the conference l1ne bemg set up‘? Srnce hearmgs rnvolve people wrth 
l1rn1ted mcome, the phone numbers need to be toll free The heanngs need to be recorded What 
steps w1ll be taken to ensure that rnformatlon 1s kept conﬁdentral‘? Are the contractors ’ st0r1ng 
recordmgs or other 1nformat1on on therr personal computers ‘? How secure are these prrvate 
computers ‘? Who else has access? Who 1s rssumg subpoenas ’? What prov1s1ons are bemg made 
for ADA requests related to hear1ngs'?

In summary, We bel1eve there would be several negatlve consequences 1f th1s b11lwere to pass
