LD 1610
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans & Legal Affairs:
I’m writing in support of LD 1610/IB 1, “An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending by 
Foreign Governments and Promote an Anticorruption Amendment to the United 
States Constitution.”  Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of
this critically important bill. 
LD1610 affirms Maine’s support for an anti-corruption amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. It directs Maine’s congressional delegation to advance such an 
amendment that would allow for reasonable campaign fundraising and spending 
limits in Maine and across the country and also charges the Maine Ethics Commission
to report annually on the progress made by Maine’s delegation – an important 
accountability measure.
As a small business owner, my voice has been drowned out by the millions spent by 
deep-pocketed corporations. It is time for Maine to take back our right to set sensible 
limits on political contributions so that small business owners – the backbone of the 
Maine economy – can once again join the conversation. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Pete Dufour
