Testimony in Support of LD 1610/ 1B l, "An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending 
by Foreign Governments and Promote an Anti-Corruption Amendment to the 
United States Constitution" 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans 
and Legal Affairs. Thank you this opportunity to speak to you today. I am Joyce Polyniak from 
Topsham and I have been concerned about the unfairness of outside inﬂuence in elections ever sinceI 
got mad at Debbie Wasserman Schultz and sent money to her opponent in a Florida election. Why 
should a person from Maine have inﬂuence in Florida? It's legal but it's wrong. 
We have sold so much of our natural resources and public landmarks to other colmtries. We have 
even allowed foreign companies to exercise eminent domain to take our land. Everything in America 
is for sale. I will ﬁght to protect my vote. My vote is my only power and I cannot sit idly by and 
watch its power be diluted by the inﬂuence of foreign money. I have enough trouble sorting fact from 
ﬁction in the American press, I do not need it complicated by any foreign money put in the mix. 
The American people need the truth as best we can discern it. We do not need outside money that 
can further warp our grasp on reality and weaken our ability to be an informed voter. 
Respect the people, respect the vote, respect yourselves and stand with Maine voters by passing LD 
1610/lB 1 outright. 
Thank you and good luck to us all.
