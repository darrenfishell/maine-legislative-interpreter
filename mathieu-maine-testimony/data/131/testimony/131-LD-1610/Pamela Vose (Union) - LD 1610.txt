LD 1610
April 30, 2023
To members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee:
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.
I am writing in strong support of LD 1610 - An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending 
by Foreign Governments and Promote an Anticorruption Amendment to the United 
States Constitution.  
Unlimited money that has flowed into our political process ever since the Citizens 
United decision has caused the voice of the average citizen to be drowned out by 
special interests.  Our political process has become a farce turning our democratic 
republic into an oligarchy.   It is past time for this to end and to make politicians 
obligated to the only voice they should hear; the individual voter.
All special interest spending is bad, but foreign special interest spending in our 
politics is the worst of the worst.
I encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on this bill and send a strong message to the 
full Legislature that this may be the most important piece of legislation you ever vote 
on.
Respectfully,
Pamela W Vose
Union, Maine
