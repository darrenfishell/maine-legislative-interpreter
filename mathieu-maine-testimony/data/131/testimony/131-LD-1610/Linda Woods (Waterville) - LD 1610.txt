Re: Testimony in Support of LD 1610, “An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending by 
Foreign Governments and Promote an Anti-Corruption Amendment to the United 
States Constitution”
Date:  April 28, 2023
My volunteering with the Say No to the New England Clean Energy Connect 
campaign opened my eyes to an injustice that occurs in Maine elections. Perhaps I 
was naive, but I had no idea that foreign money could be used to influence the 
outcomes of important Maine legislation.  
Once I verified this to be true, I helped collect signatures for the Protect Maine 
Elections citizen initiative. Most everyone I talk to listened, agreed with me, and 
signed the petition. 
Mainers want our state to be for us and about us: we reject influence from outside 
entities.  While foreign governments are not permitted to contribute to candidate 
campaigns, the Federal Elections Commission recently ruled that it has no jurisdiction
over state referendums, creating a dangerous loophole that allows corporations 
controlled by foreign governments to spend in Maine elections unless explicitly 
prohibited by state law.  Many people share my views that this loophole that allows 
foreign money to influence Maine referendum questions needs to be closed.  Passing 
this bill is an opportunity for you to support a bipartisan bill: 86% of Republicans, 
90% of Democrats, and 87% of Independents agreed with the statement that ‘The 
influence of money in politics is a threat to our democracy” according to a recent poll.
You have the opportunity to protect the integrity of our elections and to restore 
confidence in our democracy.   Let Maine issues be decided by Maine voters. I urge 
you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1610 in support of prohibiting foreign 
governments from spending money to influence Maine elections.
