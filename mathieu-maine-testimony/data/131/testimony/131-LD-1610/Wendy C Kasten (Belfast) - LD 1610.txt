LD 1610
Dear Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Honorable Members of this 
committee:
I, Wendy C. Kasten, live in Belfast. I helped collect signatures to get LD1610 on the 
agenda. Here is why I support this effort.
I believe money from foreign sources is seeping into U.S. elections from sources 
whose goal is to do us harm. We live in a time when powerful nations have become 
aggressive, and some of these have goals counter to our treasured democracy. Do we 
really want candidates who have been backed by Russia? China? North Korea? Iran?
Our democracy is under threat from internal and external sources. We CAN control 
monies, while other threats may be more complicated and pernicious. This is a sound 
step that Maine can take - and set an example for other States (as we often do). 
Let's control this aspect of our elections and prohibit foreign donations, or 
foreign-backed election ads. Let's keep our elections and their influences at home, In 
Maine, where they belong.
