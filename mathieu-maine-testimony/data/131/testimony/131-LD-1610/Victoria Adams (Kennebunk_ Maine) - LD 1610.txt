Victoria Adams
Kennebunk, Maine
LD 1610
I am strongly in favor of this bill, and helped to gather signatures in favor of it. 
I have seen many advertisements from foreign corporations, not obviously from 
foreign countries, and received mane large, color post cards from such entities, 
representing campaigns and soliciting our votes. These are obviously expensive 
campaigns, far outspending the Maine organizations on the other side of the issues. I 
see this as interference in our election process, and unfair to the voters of Maine. 
Please support Bill 1610.
