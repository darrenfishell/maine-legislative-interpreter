Protect Maine Elections Testimony
Hello. I am very concerned about the state of our democratic republic, where dark 
money contributions have been influencing, if not actively directing, the policies that 
our supposed governmental representatives are enacting into law. This is to the 
detriment of the regular citizen who works hard, pays his/her share of taxes, 
participates in voting but does not see the special interests behind the candidates. Who
is signing the campaign checks? What kind of pressure does a candidate receive from 
contributors? We should know these things in order to make a decision.
Thankfully, Maineâ€™s Clean Elections Act addresses some campaign finance issues. As
I understand it, the Protect Maine Elections bill will prohibit election campaign 
spending by foreign governments and related corporate entities in Maine, as we 
witnessed recently in the Corridor debate. 60% of Mainers bucked the heavy 
advertising and supported the referendum. In a similar vein, I saw Ranked Choice 
Voting as a way to neutralize the forces of special interests by forcing candidates to 
appeal to second choice voters with policies that benefit a true majority of citizens. I 
am proud of the leadership Maine has shown in supporting the integrity of our 
election systems, ensuring that Maine citizen votes are meaningful at the same time as
very accessible -- thus keeping Maine for Mainers.
Thank you, Charlotte Brown
