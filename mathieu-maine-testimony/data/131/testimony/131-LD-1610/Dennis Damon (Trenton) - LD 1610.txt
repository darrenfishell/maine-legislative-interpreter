LD 1610
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans & Legal Affairs:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 1610/IB 1, “An 
Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending by Foreign Governments and Promote an 
Anticorruption Amendment to the United States Constitution.” 
I was honored to represent Hancock County in the Maine Senate from 2002 - 2010. 
While no longer in office, I feel it is important to speak out in support of efforts that 
would benefit Hancock County as well as the rest of Maine. Now is one of those 
times. 
I firmly believe our democracy works best when centered on the Maine voters. 
However, right now the voices of Maine voters are being drowned out each election 
cycle by millions of dollars in spending by dark money special interest groups, and 
even foreign governments. 
It is unconscionable that foreign governments are currently allowed to spend in 
Maine’s referendum campaigns, the very tool by which Maine voters can affect state 
laws. I understand this is because of a loophole recently created by the Federal 
Elections Commission. Maine must act immediately to close this loophole to protect 
our democracy. It would be negligent not to. 
I strongly urge you to join the 82% of Maine voters who support prohibiting foreign 
government spending in our elections and vote in support of LD 1610. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Senator Dennis S. Damon
Trenton, Maine
