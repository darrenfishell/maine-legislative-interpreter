LD 1610
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans & Legal Affairs:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 1610/IB 1, “An 
Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending by Foreign Governments and Promote an 
Anticorruption Amendment to the United States Constitution.” I regret that I am 
unable to present my statement to you in person today, but I am currently traveling 
out of state.
After serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, I served as Deputy Director of the
United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In this role, I witnessed 
firsthand how foreign governments try to disrupt our democracy for their own benefit.
This is not some phantom fear, it is a reality we face every day. 
LD 1610 is long overdue and should be passed immediately in order to protect our 
elections as well as our national security.  To not pass this bill borders on negligence. 
I strongly encourage you to vote in support of LD 1610. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Hon. Dave Emery
