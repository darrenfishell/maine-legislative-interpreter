LD 1610
Dear Veterans and Legal Affairs committee, 
My name is Colin Vettier, I'm a Portland ME resident, and I'd like to share my love 
for democracy in Maine and my support in favor of LD 1610.
Maine is not for sale to foreign governments or wealthy campaign contributors. Maine
belongs to the Maine people. 
Unlimited, unchecked spending in campaigns by corporations, special interests groups
and wealthy donors has silenced the voices of the Maine people. So I believe Maine 
deserves an anti-corruption amendment to the U.S. Constitution that will restore the 
power of our people and legislature to fully regulate our campaign finance laws.
To protect our elections, I urge you to support LD 1610. 
Kindly
