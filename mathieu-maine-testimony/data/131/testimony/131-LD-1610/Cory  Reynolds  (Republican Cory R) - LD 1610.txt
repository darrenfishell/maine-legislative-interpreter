LD 1610
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs, I am Cory Reynolds and I am testifying 
today in Support Of LD-1610 because I believe in clean elections, in 2020 our 
Election was stolen and that’s why Joe Biden and Gov Janet Mills won. 
I am sick and tired of our government controlling us. Monday night Maine people 
were shutdown to testify in only 1 min while letting people that fit your agenda got 3 
mins to speak. this was very disappointing to the Maine People. You work for the 
Maine people not for yourself. I don’t want a New World Order. 
please vote ought to pass on LD-1610.
Thank You,
