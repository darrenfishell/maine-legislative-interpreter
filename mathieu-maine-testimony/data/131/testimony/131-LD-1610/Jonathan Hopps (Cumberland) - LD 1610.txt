LD 1610
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
I would like to offer my support for LD 1610 An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending 
by Foreign Governments and Promote an Anticorruption Amendment to the United 
States Constitution.
Over the past year I have volunteered my time to go towns around Southern Maine to 
collect signatures in favor of this act and the  support both with Maine citizens 
signatures and their verbal support  was overwhelming and inspiring that people do 
care to even the playing field with political campaign monies so Maine voters have an
equitable voice in how our state is run. I urged you to endorse LD 1610 and move on 
with other legislative priorities, 
Sincerely,
Jonathan Hopps
Cumberland, Maine
