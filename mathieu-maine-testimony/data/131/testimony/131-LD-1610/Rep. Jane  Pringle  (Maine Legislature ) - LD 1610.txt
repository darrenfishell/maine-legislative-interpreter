District 107: Windham (Part) 
  
Testimony of Rep. Jane Pringle in opposition to 
LD 1610, An Act to Prohibit Campaign Spending by Foreign Governments and Promote 
an Anticorruption Amendment to the United States Constitution 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, I am Representative Jane Pringle, and I live in and represent District 
107, part of Windham. I ask the Committee to not pass LD 1610, An Act to Prohibit Campaign 
Spending by Foreign Governments and Promote an Anticorruption Amendment to the 
United States Constitution as written. 
I am a strong supporter of clean elections, spending limits and transparency for all election 
issues. I do not support excluding “foreign” countries or businesses from providing information 
that helps us decide election issues that pertain to them. 
 
Maine shares a large border with Canada, along with many friends, neighbors and family in 
Canada. Maine also has a long ocean coastline and many businesses that contribute to our 
economy and people. 
 
I believe that they should be able to communicate their interests within the transparency and 
spending limits we impose.  If the bill is amended to reflect that I would be able to support it.  
 
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony.
