Dear Senator Craig Hickman, Representative Laura Supica and Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans' and Legal Affairs,
The provisions of this bill address grave threats to our democracy and I hope  it will 
be a "no-brainer"for you to vigorously support this bill.  I was surprised to learn that 
"foreign governments, foreign government-owned entities, and foreign 
government-influenced entities" are allowed to spend money influencing maine 
elections, both of candidates and measures, in the first place! 
I have no problem with this passing via the statehouse instead of going to a 
referendum because it is so clear that there is broad bipartisan support for it.  It is 
worrisome that Governor Mills has once vetoed such a measure but trust she will do 
the will of the people this time.
Thanks for your work on behalf of the people of Maine.
Best regards,
Leda Beth
