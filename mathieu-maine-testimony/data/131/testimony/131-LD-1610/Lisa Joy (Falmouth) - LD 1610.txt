This bill needs reworking.
Its most important part is minimized at the end. 
“Free speech” is not a wide open gate for knowingly deceiving and/or monetarily 
corrupting our representative (“of the people, by the people, for the people”) brand of 
government, which today retains a thin, chipped veneer of checks and balances 
underneath which is rot at all structural levels.
The grossly debilitating and destabilizing influence of deep— and now dark— 
pockets of individual, family and corporate (industry) billionaires have imperiled “the
people,” accelerating erasure of the American Dream of home ownership, further 
shrinking and subjugating our “middle class” by co-opting its wallet, while 
minimizing financial, environmental, health and consumer protections by corrupting 
(or making anemic) regulators and regulatory agencies.
Legislation to reverse this tsunami is of paramount importance. Write a bill with teeth 
for that item alone calling on our national representatives to sponsor a constitutional 
amendment that ends dark money and caps PAC monies (e.g. at average amounts 
historically raised in races and referenda by legitimate (non-industry-sponsored) 
consumer advocacy and grassroots groups.) In other words, sponsor a bill calling on 
our national reps to level the playing field.
Regarding the top-heavy portion of this bill:
Mainers need Versant Power, do they not? If they do, then the parent company should
not be held hostage to poorly-crafted Maine law that doesn’t allow legitimate 
exceptions.
Why does the Maine State Chamber of Commerce and the Maine Forest Products 
Council oppose this type of legislation? Surely those entities understand the bigger 
picture that voters triggered by superficially-appealing phrasing do not.
Create a separate bill (no federal anti-corruption mandate stuck on) and amend it to 
include legitimate common-sense exceptions, and I will support it.
Thank you
