LD 1610
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs:
My name is Linnea Maravell.  I live in Saco. I am testifying in support of LD1610
We have seen the barrage of ads foreign entities have rained down upon us.  
None of this is free.  Mainers end up paying for these ads in more ways than one.
Whether it is money missing out of our pockets via higher costs and/or decisions that 
don't benefit us, none of it should be controlled by foreign powers.  
I urge you to vote "ought to pass" on LD 1610.
Thank you,
Linnea Maravell
