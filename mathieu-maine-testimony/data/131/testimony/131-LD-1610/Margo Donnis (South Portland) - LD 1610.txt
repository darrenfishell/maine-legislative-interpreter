I support this bill. I want to block foreign governments from donating to Maine 
elections. And, I feel strongly that Citizens United should be overturned. Corporations
have been unrestricted in their spending to influence elections. Average Americans 
who work and are raising families have a hard time following candidates, and so are 
being influenced by misleading advertisements for candidates.  Working Americans 
do not have the time to figure out if these ads are truthful.
