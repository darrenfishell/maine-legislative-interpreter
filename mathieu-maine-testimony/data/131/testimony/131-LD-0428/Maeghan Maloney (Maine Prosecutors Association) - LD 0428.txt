ATTORNEY GENERAL 
March 6, 2023 
Senator Beebe—Center, Representative Salisbury, and 
Honorable members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, my name is Maeghan Maloney, I ain the District 
Attorney for Kennebec and Somerset Counties and the President of 
the Maine Prosecutors Association (“MPA”) and I am submitting this 
Written testimony in support of LD 428 and 429 — An Act to ,; A’ 
Reclassify Certain Offenses under the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
Laws and Increase the Efficiency of the Criminal Justice System, 
and An Act to Reclassify Certain Offenses Under the Motor Vehicle 
Laws and Increase the Efficiency of the Criminal Justice System. 
The Maine Prosecutors Association is pleased to testify in 
support of LD 428 and 429. The proposed legislation is designed to 
reclassify many Class E crimes found in'Tit1e 12 (our hunting laws) 
and Title 29-A (our motor vehicle laws) to civil and traffic violations. 
The impact of this legislation will be meaningful to the State of 
Maine in many Ways. The most significant change is that 
individuals Who commit these offenses will no longer be classified 
as criminals. A criminal conviction can have significant 
consequences. The reclassification still allows for a level of~ 
accountability when the offenses are committed and charged 
individuals will still be afforded an opportunity for a hearing to 
contest any charges. However, the end result would be an 
adjudication on a civil violation or traffic infraction and nota
criminal conviction. Another meaningful change would occur within the criminal justice system as a whole. It is no secret that our criminal justice system was already overwhelmed prior to March of 2020. Since the pandemic, the backlog of cases has dramatically increased. This legislation would re-direct the traffic infractions to the Judicial Branch’s Violations Bureau and traffic court. The civil 
violations from Title 12 would remain in the District Court but would most likely be resolved on a single hearing date after 
arraignment. The result will be a much more efficient processing of these cases. Finally, this legislation is an example of a successful collaboration of many government agencies and branches of 
government. We are grateful for the time and analysis provided by the Department of Inland Fisheries, Department of Public Safety, the Secretary of State’s Office, and our legislative sponsor, Rep. Bill 
Pluecker. The MPA believes this legislation is an 6X8II1pl6 of how We can make significant positive changes to our criminal justice system by Working together. Thank you. 
We urge you to vote in favor of LD 428 and LD 429. 
Thank you for your consideration,
