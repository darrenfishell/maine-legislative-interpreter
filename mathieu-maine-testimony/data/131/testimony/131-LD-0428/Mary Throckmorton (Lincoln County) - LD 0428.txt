LD 428
Dear Committee Chairs and Members,
In opposition to LD 428 
An Act to Reclassify Certain Offenses Under the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Laws and 
Increase the Efficiency of the Criminal Justice System.
This bill weakens or eliminates penalties for hunting and fishing violations. In most 
cases, it removes the wording "minimum fine of $50" to "may be imposed" and 
eliminates any potential for jail sentencing in repeat offenders.
Why follow laws if you can get away with breaking them with no consequences?
I think back on some of the fines I have paid in my lifetime- no haggling, here is a 
speeding ticket for $200 for going 30 in a 25. Yet gun owners and those who are 
supposed to be policing them don't deserve a $50 minimum fine for wielding a loaded
weapon on say, public lands, without paying a ridiculously low amount for a license? 
The inconvenience of buying a license on an annual basis was removed years ago 
with the ability to purchase a "lifetime license".  
Wouldn't it be nice to purchase a lifetime driver's license in Maine and not suffer any 
penalties for traffic infractions? Yet that is what this bill is proposing for a select "in" 
group -apparently one that has trouble following very generous rules for luring bear 
with bait over an extended period of time, loosing packs of hounds in the woods to 
terrorize wildlife and landowners, claiming prime shooting spots in Merrymeeting 
Bay, which is supposed to be a waterfowl sanctuary, purchasing at token cost a 
license and ensuring supervision of youth hunters, etc etc.
Please oppose  LD 428 
An Act to Reclassify Certain Offenses Under the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Laws and 
Increase the Efficiency of the Criminal Justice System and perhaps suggest to the sponsors 
that next session they return with a bill that supports stronger rules and larger fines for 
violators of Maine's minimal game laws.
Thank you.
