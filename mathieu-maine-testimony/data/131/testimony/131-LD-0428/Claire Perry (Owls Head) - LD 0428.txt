Dear Honorable Committee Members: 
As a landowner of over 100 acres of prime hunting land and avid hunter for many 
years, I fail to see how this bill will benefit ethical hunters or our citizenry and 
landowners in general. 
Much, if not most of the land that hunters in Maine are using, is not theirs. It is privately 
owned. Unposted land is currently considered open to hunting; a privilege that is becoming 
more and more tenuous as time passes. This uncommon privilege should not be taken lightly.
  
 Maine citizens are a trusting bunch. They trust that hunters entering their property, carrying a
lethal weapon, are going to be responsible in all areas of Maine's hunting laws.
Thus, to lessen the penalties for breaking those laws and regulations benefits one 
party and one party only; the offenders.
Also, please know: Our game wardens have the ability to assess any tenuous hunting 
situation. The decision to write up a hunter or not, is theirs alone to make. I feel the 
vast majority of them are capable of doing a good job. 
 Therefore, I encourage you to vote in opposition to  this bill's passage. 
Thank you.
