LD 3
Hello,
I’m writing regarding LD3- An Act to Establish Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program. Please support reconsidering LD1 Emergency 
Funding for Housing BEFORE the holiday break.
Before moving to Brunswick, I lived in areas of Portland close to where a lot of 
unhoused neighbors camped outside or busked for change. I had people store 
belongings below my windows and camp in my backyard and it was never a problem.
In fact my unhoused neighbors were often more friendly and conscientious than I’ve 
seen in other areas of the city. These folks were struggling, and I was horrified to 
learn in 2021 when Joy Cyr froze to death around the block from my apartment. 
I believe that we all have a responsibility to care for the most vulnerable members of 
our communities, locally and especially in state government. The individuals and 
families who will be displaced in the next few weeks don’t have time to wait. The 
incredible work of nonprofits like Maine Needs can only go so far. Please support 
LD1 and any efforts to direct government assistance to people who desperately need 
assistance. 
Thank you
