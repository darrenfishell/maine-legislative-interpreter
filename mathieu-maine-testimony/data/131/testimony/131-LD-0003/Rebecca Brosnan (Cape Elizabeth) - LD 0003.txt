Please reconsider funding for emergency heat and rental assistance. I am a concerned 
citizen and a mother, and I am very worried for folks who are without housing or 
getting evicted this winter. The shelters are full, and GA-accepting hotels are full, and
many people have no choice but to sleep out in the cold. People will die unless we 
help them. Some of these people are veterans. Some of these people are very sick. 
Some of these people are children. 
While I try to make the holidays magical for my kids, I am struck by how fortunate 
we are to have our basic needs met and the ability to do extra things to make 
Christmas special. My heart breaks for those less fortunate. I am so grateful for the 
case workers who are trying with all their might to find solutions to keep people off 
the streets, and if that fails, to keep them from freezing to death by finding tents and 
sleeping bags. But it’s not enough! Please, can we at least just fund these programs 
for a few more months until the coldest months are behind us? People won’t get an 
opportunity to turn their lives around if they don’t even survive the winter.
The causes of poverty and homelessness are complex, and we may not be able to solve 
them with this bill, but in the short-term, this is absolutely critical to protect our neighbors from
a cruel and preventable worsening or shortening of their lives.
