LD 3
As a public library worker in Portland, Maine, over the last nine years I have seen the 
devastating effect of being unhoused, unseen, and unheard. More Mainers -   families 
and children, veterans, those who have endured the effects of systemic racism and 
generational poverty, than ever are facing the reality of being unhoused and 
potentially dying, yes, dying, because we still do not prioritize our neighbors. 
You have the chance to stand up for your unhoused neighbors and reconsider LD1 
now. Three weeks is too long to wait. Imagine sleeping in your car tonight as you 
crawl into your warm bed. Do you have children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews?
Can you decide today to speak up for those countless, yes countless, children who can
not speak for themselves. Those who will sleep in a car, on a floor or couch, those 
who will not make it into a shelter tonight because there is just no more room. The 
parents sitting upright all night so a child may sleep at their feet for safety. 
Even I, with a “good city job” have been forced out of Portland due to the outrageous 
cost of rents that have outpaced my pay increases, and spent three months this fall 
staying with friends and moving place to place. I can not afford to live in the city 
where I work and was technically unhoused and I have all the resources and safety 
nets of family, friends, and thankfully some savings and was still in this position. 
We respectfully ask you to do the real will of the people of Maine and care for those 
truly most in need this winter. The people of Maine are compassionate caring big 
hearted folks who want you to help them take care of each other. Together we can 
absolutely make a difference in peoples lives. 
In solidarity,
