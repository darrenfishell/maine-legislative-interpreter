Our job is to be neighbors to one another. This is a particularly cruel time of year for 
families and individuals to find themselves without the amenities we all deserve as 
basic human rights: protection from the elements, a home...
As a devout Christian, I implore you during this high holiday season for many faiths 
to do what many of our religious traditions ask us to do: to extend compassion 
without inquiring whether or not another family deserves the comforts we enjoy.
