LD 3
Testimony to the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
regarding LD3# An act to establish the winter energy relief payment program to aid 
residents with high heating costs and to finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment
Program. Public Hearing scheduled for December 21, 2022
Chairs Senator Troy Jackson and Representative Rachel Talbot Ross and members of 
the committee
My name is Priscilla Payne and I am a resident of Windham, Maine and a member of my faith
community Cumberland Congregational Church, UCC.  I am writing in strong support of LD 
#3.
When I think of the elderly, families with children and all those who live and work in Maine but
their income does not allow them to keep up with the cost of heating, housing,  electricity and 
rising food costs it tears at my heart.  We who are more fortunate must do all that we can to 
help these people.
As a state we have been neglectful in our care of those less fortunate folks.  Even the 
proposed $450.00 assistance for heating will not fill a 250 gallon oil tank at todayâ€™s 
prices.  The rental assistance monies are truly needed also.  I know of a single mother 
who has five young children who is due to be evicted at the end of this month.  Where
will they go when all the shelters are full and there are no affordable apartments for 
them to live in? She and her children will be out in the cold.
I urge all members of the committee to support LD#3.  I have contacted my State 
Senator Tim Nangle and my Representative Jane Pringle and they are both supportive 
of this bill.  Then in this legislative session you must all work to solve the problem of 
high heating costs and the lack of affordable housing.  Both are daunting tasks but I 
have faith that good people will work to solve these critical issues.
Sincerely,
Priscilla Payne
