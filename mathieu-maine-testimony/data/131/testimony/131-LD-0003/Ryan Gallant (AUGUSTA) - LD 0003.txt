I am writing in regards to the use of funds from Mainecare, particularly Sect 21 and 
Sect 29, to assist with funding this bill.  I am strongly opposed to use of any funds 
from Sect 21 and Sect 29 for this bill.  These services are already at a critical stage 
due to lack of staffing and any extra funding should be directly appropriated to 
address the staffing crisis,  which puts thousands of Mainers at risk if left 
unaddressed.
