My income is under $100,000. 00 and, gratefully, I don't want or need fuel assistance.  I think 
weatherization should be required and square footage should be a factor.  Also, heating costs
are no different if recipients are married or not.  Before my husband died, our fuel usage was 
the same as it is now.  The house requires a certain amount of fuel to maintain heat no matter
how many people live in it.
I wish there were a better way to assist those in need.
