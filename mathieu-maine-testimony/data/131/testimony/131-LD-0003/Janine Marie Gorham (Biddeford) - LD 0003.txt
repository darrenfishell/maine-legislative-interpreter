Dear Committee Members 
I am writing to you so you can hear how important this bill is to working class and disabled 
Mainers.
I am a survivor of Domestic Violence, and life is not easy.  The monies you are voting on 
goes to things like heat and new tires for my car so I can get back and forth to not only Dr's 
appointments but to visit with Loved ones to maintain my mental health.  
I have not received my 850.00 that each Mainer was promised, as a person with a disability it 
took me a while to make sure all of my tax paperwork was in order to mail in, and the monies 
has run out.
Those 850.00 dollars make a world of difference in my life, do not let the most in need, those 
like me, who struggle with paperwork and the details of life on our own and disabled, go 
without what other Mainers have received.
Thank you for your service to our Great State of Maine
