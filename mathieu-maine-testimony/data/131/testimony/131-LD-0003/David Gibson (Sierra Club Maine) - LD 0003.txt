 My name is Da vid Gibson. In addition t o serving as a member of the Sierr a Club MaineExecuti ve Committ ee, I am the Dir ector of Ener gy at College of the A tlantic and a r esident ofMorrill. My t estimon y is on behalf of m yself, the Legislati ve Team of Sierr a Club Maine, andour 22,000 members and support ers acr oss the stat e.
Firstl y, I w ould lik e to recognize the ur gency of this moment . Man y Mainers f ace a dualchallenge of rising and unpr ecedent ed heating costs, as w ell as the end of Emer gencyRental Assistance, just as wint er is starting. This issue is lit erally a matt er of lif e or death f orsome of our most vulner able r esidents. I w ould lik e to emphasize a dir e need f or heatingassistance and emer gency housing assistance in an y emer gency r elief pack age and e xpressgratitude t o the legislatur e for tr eating this matt er with the seriousness it deserv es.
However, I w ould also lik e to emphasize the need f or addr essing the s ystemic r oot of thisdual crisis thr ough investing in our clean ener gy futur e. I am a Certified Ener gy Managerand Building P erformance Institut e Building Anal yst. I ha ve transitioned mor e than a dozenbuildings in Maine entir ely off of f ossil fuels, including m y own home.
High ener gy costs ar e a comple x and long-t erm pr oblem. The y are caused b y inefficientbuildings, widespr ead dependence on f ossil fuels, and the price v olatility of g lobal mar ketsand int ernational e vents. While ther e is little our small stat e can do t o impact int ernationalsuppl y issues and g lobal price fluctuation, opportunities still e xist t o saf eguar d ag ainstsimilar futur e crises. Heating costs ha ve roughly doubled fr om tw o years ago; and ther e’sno w ay to kno w with certainty w hat the cost of our r eliance on f ossil fuels will be tw o, five,or ten y ears fr om no w.
To trul y addr ess the pr oblem, w e need t o impr ove the efficiency of hundr eds of thousandsof homes acr oss the stat e, and educat e Mainers on opportunities t o save mone y thr oughener gy efficient habits and adoption of clean heating t echnologies – f ocusing first onMainers most at risk. Prioritizing lo w-income and w orking class r esidents w on’t just ensur egreater resilience in times of crisis, it will sa ve families and w orkers thousands of dollars inthe long run.

In this legislation or a futur e bill, I r ecommend the f ollowing st eps t o reduce the risk offutur e heating crises:
1.I would hig hly encour age y ou to allocat e a portion of the funds (10%) t owardscreating a r evolving-loan fund (in the Efficiency Maine Clean Ener gy A cceler ator) t ooffer 0% int erest loans f or home efficiency impr ovements. This will help r educelong-t erm ener gy costs, pr eventing the curr ent emer gency fr om r epeating y ear aft eryear.
2.It would also be wise t o invest a small portion of these funds t o support a dedicat edcoor dinat or or tw o in the Go vernor’s office and Efficiency Maine t o help coor dinat ework betw een Maine’s agencies. The person in this r ole w ould collabor ate with ourFeder al deleg ation and the Biden A dministr ation t o help shape the rules f or theallocation of funds fr om the multi-y ear allocations of the Inflation R eduction A ct andto secur e funds fr om that A ct and other F eder al sour ces f or pr ograms and pr ojects inMaine and t o impr ove the r egional grid serving Maine. These eff orts w ould helpreduce long-t erm ener gy costs.
3.I would also encour age y ou to allocat e a portion of funds annuall y to grow Maine 'sworkforce and e xpand the pool of ener gy efficiency and electrification installers inthe stat e. Thousands of Mainers need little persuasion t o invest in efficiencyupgr ades, but the per ennial challenge is finding trust ed, skilled contr actors t o do thework. A str onger w orkforce w ould allo w mor e Mainers t o tak e ad vantage of e xistingincenti ves and, o ver time, r educe the t otal demand f or heating fuels stat ewide. Asthe ener gy efficiency field continues t o grow, investing in the w orkforce isincr easing ly a win-win f or both Maine r esidents and our stat e’s econom y.
Thank y ou Go vernor Janet Mills, Senat e Pr esident T roy Jack son, and Speak er Talbot R oss f orbringing this legislation f orw ard and acting s wiftl y to save lives this wint er.
