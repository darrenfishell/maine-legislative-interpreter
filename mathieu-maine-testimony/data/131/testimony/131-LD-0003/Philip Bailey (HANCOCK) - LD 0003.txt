I want to keep this simple. I don't think it's a Red or Blue issue, it's a people issue. For
me, it's the retired guy in my town who is too scared to turn the thermostat above 50 
and is basically living in a sleeping bag in his house. It's the guy I buy fish from at the
store who told me the home they rent needs insulation and they can't get help. I'm sure
that every member of this committee has seen and heard from many people. We're 
Mainers and when people get burned out of a home we pull together and get them 
help. This is an opportunity to help people get through winter without raising taxes, 
it's targeted and effective. Beyond the checks for heating, which is the quickest way to
get needed support, housing is a critical need. Please heed the call and help the most 
people possible.
