hello
I am all for the heating assistance  (and the federal funds)
 
I am unhappy with the $450 checks going to too many people. Should be targeted to those 
most in need. I prefer the income limits proposed later in a compromise (I think 50K for 
individuals and $75 for married couples?)   FYI_I would be getting a check under the bill 
recently defeated, but NOT in the newer version proposed as compromise above â€“ and I think
that is correct!!  There are others far needier than myself! This should be truly needs-based!  
And immediate!
