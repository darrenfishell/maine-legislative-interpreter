Senator Jackson, Representative Ross, members of the Committee on Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs:
My name is Frederick Samp, a resident of Saco, Maine, and I would like to testify neither for nor 
against LD3.  Rather, I would like to address the eligibility criteria for the proposed Winter Energy Relief 
Payment Program in Section B-3.  
Both this Program and the recent pandemic relief program enacted by the 130th Legislature 
appear to be intended to provide relief to low- and middle-income Mainers and to limit program costs 
by excluding wealthy Mainers.  Presumably for the sake of administrative simplicity and speed the 
earlier Legislature chose to base eligibility on a single criterion – the amount reported on 2021 Maine 
tax returns as federal adjusted gross income (AGI).  I trust that Legislators at the time recognized that 
AGI for a single year was at best a crude measure of Mainers’ wealth and that the program would 
necessarily exclude some Maine residents who were far needier than other taxpayers who were 
included.  The use of a single tax year may well not be representative of a taxpayer’s wealth – a single 
capital transaction can drastically affect AGI – and an isolated snapshot of income does not necessarily 
give a true picture of a taxpayer’s financial situation.  The roughness of the measures was also 
exacerbated by the fact that eligibility was all or nothing – a taxpayer with AGI just $1 above the cutoff 
qualified for no relief while one with AGI $1 below the cutoff qualified for the full amount.
Recognizing that the earlier program necessarily resulted in unfairness in individual cases, 
adoption of exactly the same eligibility criteria, as is being proposed for this program, simply compounds 
the problem.  It would be relatively simple to vary or modify the eligibility criteria for this Winter Energy 
Relief Program to avoid compounding any unfairness, for example, by adding AGI in tax year 2020 or 
2022 to the available measures or by using a different measure altogether.
