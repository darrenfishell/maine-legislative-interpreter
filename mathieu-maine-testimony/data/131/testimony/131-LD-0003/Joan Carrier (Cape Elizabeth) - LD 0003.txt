Pandemic housing protection programs are ending. This is leaving many Mainers, 
including asylum seekers, with the prospect of becoming unhoused/unsheltered in the 
very near future, just as winter is setting in.  Families with pregnant mothers and 
newborn babies among those being affected. And to top it off, asylum seekers who 
have not been in the U.S. for at least 5 months are not allowed to work.
Please pass this bill in order to prevent the worst from happening. To do otherwise 
would be unconscionable
