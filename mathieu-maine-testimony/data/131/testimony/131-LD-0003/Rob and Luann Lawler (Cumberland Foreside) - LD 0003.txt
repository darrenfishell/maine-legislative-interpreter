Although we support heating assistance for needy Mainers, we are TOTALLY 
AGAINST $35 million coming out of Home and Community Based Services.  Instead
of taking $35 million out of HCBS, the state should leave the money in HCBS and 
use it to address the  MASSIVE workforce crisis caused by too-low wages for direct 
support professionals.  As the parents of a developmentally disabled daughter who 
needs 24/7 coverage, we are witnessing first hand the continuous turnover and lack of 
direct care staff. This is providing tremendous anxiety for both her and us as parents. 
Why do the disabled of Maine always seen to come in last??!!!???
