Please do not reappropriate funds that are already designated for sections 29 and 21.  
The programs supporting these folks are already having a hard time hiring staff 
because they cannot pay enough to compete for employees.  Many folks are on 
waiting lists to access services for which they are eligible but there is not enough 
funding.  I am so disappointed to see this callous moving of funds.  I realize the fed is 
supposed to add the funds back in but there should be MORE funding so the waitlists 
can be shortened.  This seems like a bad move, is there really no other place to get the
funds when the State is saying there will be a surplus next year?
