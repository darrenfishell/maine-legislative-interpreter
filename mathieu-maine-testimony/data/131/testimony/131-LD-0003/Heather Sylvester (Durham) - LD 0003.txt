LD 3
It is a deep concern that there is no plan and no aid for hundreds of Mainers who will no 
longer benefit from Emergency Relief Assistance on December 31st. 
We have entered winter, and temperatures at night are below freezing. The State must pass 
LD3 to bring aid for this statewide crisis or people will be dying on our streets.
