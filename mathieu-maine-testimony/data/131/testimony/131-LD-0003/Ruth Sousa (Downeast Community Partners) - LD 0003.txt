I urge the Maine Legislature to approve this funding bill to ensure that our neighbors can 
survive this yearâ€™s Maine Winter. 
It is true that heating costs have skyrocketed and - especially during this week of plummeting 
temperatures - I fear for my neighbors. And this is only December!
This bill will provide help for 92% of Mainers! What on Earth is the hold up?!
These moneys are being drawn from surplus funds, and I cannot imagine a more worthy 
cause. 
Thank you for your consideration.
