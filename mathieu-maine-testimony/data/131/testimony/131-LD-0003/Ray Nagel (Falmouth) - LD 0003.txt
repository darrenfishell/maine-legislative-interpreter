I am Ray Nagel, the Executive Director of Independence Association.  We are a 
non-profit organization dedicated to supporting individuals with developmental 
disabilities since 1966. I do NOT support using money for heating costs by taking it 
from Section 21 and 29.  MaineCare continues to overlook the needs of people with 
intellectual disabilities and the money which has been earmarked for people served by
Section 21/29 is NOT the way to offset the problem of heating. Giving individuals a 
check for $450 is not a targeted program when people of any financial background 
receives the same amount.  There must be other opportunities to provide heating 
relief.  Stop taking advantage of people with intellectual disabilities.  They do not 
have the ability to fight back.
