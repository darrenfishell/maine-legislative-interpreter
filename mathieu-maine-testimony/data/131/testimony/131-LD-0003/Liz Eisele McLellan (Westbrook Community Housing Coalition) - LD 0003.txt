PLEASE REPLACE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED TESTIMONY WITH THIS 
VERSION. THANK YOU.
Thank you for holding this Public Hearing. 
We are a group of community members, faith leaders, school and city representatives, and 
nonprofit organizations looking to help ease the burden of becoming unhoused for our friends 
and neighbors. Partnering with One Westbrook, we have organized as the Westbrook 
Community Housing Coalition and have been working together to address the housing crisis 
within Westbrook. 
The impact of losing the ERA funding at the onset of winter has exacerbated the 
current housing situation. As we head into a Maine winter, we are fearful for Mainers 
who live paycheck to paycheck or have already found themselves out in the cold. As 
the temperatures drop, and oil and electricity prices soar, there is no doubt that people 
will suffer.  
In Westbrook, we have 52 students (and their families) that are unhoused and over 
200 families that have already lost their ERA funding. These numbers do not include 
unhoused individuals who do not have children in the school system and are living in 
their cars or on the streets. In surrounding towns, there are 700 families that are losing
their ERA funding at the end of the month. 
We are trying to stem a tsunami in the middle of a nor'easter. We encounter obstacles 
at every turn. Even when we know who to send someone to, they do not have enough 
resources to help. We also have a lot of new Mainers living in Westbrook, many who 
are not yet eligible to work, who need to get through the winter. 
The challenges are many, but they can be faced together. Emerging from the current 
crisis is going to take all of us. It cannot be put on individuals, volunteers and 
organizations. We need support and financing from the State of Maine. Our friends 
and neighbors, our fellow Mainers, need your help to survive the winter. 
Please listen to these stories and testimonies with compassion. You have the ability 
and the budget to help the people in Maine that need it most. Do the right thing.
