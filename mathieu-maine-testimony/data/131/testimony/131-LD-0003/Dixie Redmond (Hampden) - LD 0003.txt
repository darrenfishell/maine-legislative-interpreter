LD 3
To the honorable and esteemed chairs and members of the appropriations and financial 
affairs committee:
 
I'm Dixie Redmond and I am against LD 3 as currently proposed. I am the mom of a young 
man who is autistic and needs 24-7 support. I do support home heating oil assistance but do 
not support taking money away from Home and Community Programs, which are deeply 
behind in achieving their mission. Please consider the alternative proposal from Senators 
Bennett & Grohoski.
 
As of September 2022, 218 people with developmental disabilities were still waiting for day 
services.  There are 2,028 people waiting for necessary housing through the Section 21 
waiver. Many are these are people who are at risk without staff support and housing. And yet 
they wait and wait and wait. My own son has only been able to access about 1/2 of eligible 
staff support hours in ten years. 
Recently in the news, it was highlighted that a man with intellectual/developmental 
disabilities was homeless for 3 months and had finally been placed in a safe living 
situation. Many people with developmental disabilities are trapped in emergency 
room scenarios because Maine has not followed through in making a path for people 
with disabilities to live their lives. The federal dollars provided was to have helped 
make a path for people with developmental disabilities to NOT be homeless before 
getting housing supports. 
Surely there are better solutions.  Again, please consider the alternative proposal from
Senators Bennett & Grohoski. 
I am deeply appreciative of the hard decisions that must be made, and ask that the most 
needy not be pitted against each other. 
 
I urge you to defeat this proposal. 
Thank you, 
Dixie Redmond
