Hands off our money!
Taking money from persons with disabilities to fund another check to Mainers just to 
grab a headline for political points is wrong in so many ways!
Adults with disabilities have not done well during the pandemic and were left 
forgotten in regards to their mental health needs during months and months of endless
isolation.
My daughter, who is 18 and has Down syndrome, waited for 18 months for 
counseling to deal with the stress of an upside down world following the advent of 
COVID 19. During this time, she aged out of childrens’ services, and has been in 
limbo ever since.
She is still waiting, and on the waiting list for section 29. She has no services, and 
spends most of her freetime on Youtube. I do what I can, and pay out of pocket for a 
friend to come take her out to the community once a week for two hours. As a single 
parent, I can’t afford much more than that. Yet, I realize that I am/she is one of the 
lucky ones - at least she has that two hours a week.
Don’t take our money! Parents and adult children with special needs are just holding on!
Take some responsibility, like Paul LePage did, and FULLY FUND section 21 and 29 
services.
Don’t rob us, support us!
