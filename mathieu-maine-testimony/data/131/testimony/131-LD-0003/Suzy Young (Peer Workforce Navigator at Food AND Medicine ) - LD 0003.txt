Suzy Young
Peer Workforce Navigator at Food AND Medicine 
LD 3
President Troy Jackson, Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs.
My name is Suzy Young and I am the Peer Workforce Navigator at Food AND Medicine in 
Brewer. I work with community members every day, from young families to the elderly, that 
are worried about whether they will make it through the cold winter months. Those are the 
very same people many of you talked to while knocking on doors in the fall and I am sure this 
comes as no surprise to anyone. Many of them are choosing between heating oil and other 
basic needs to survive and be the valuable members of their community that they are. 
Growing up in a small town in Maine as the daughter of a Fire Chief, I am also 
concerned about the community members well being. If they canâ€™t afford to purchase 
heating oil to properly heat their homes, my concern is they may use makeshift 
heating sources that could lead to either carbon monoxide poisoning  or setting their 
residence on fire. This could lead to more than one dwelling burning and displacing 
one or many from their homes out into an already established housing crisis here in 
Maine. I know this scenario to be true as in April 1983, my grandmother lost her life 
in a house fire after running out of heating oil in the middle of the night and did just 
that, using a makeshift heating source. Mainers are resilient and they are going to do 
what they need to do to survive.
Although LD 3 isn't a permanent solution, it would give many Maine residents a hand up to be
safe this winter. 
I urge you to pass LD3 and ensure that it goes into effect as quickly as possible.
