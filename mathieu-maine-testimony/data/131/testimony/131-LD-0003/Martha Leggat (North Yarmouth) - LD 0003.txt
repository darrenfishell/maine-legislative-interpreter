LD 3
I strongly urge legislators to vote in favor of LD3. I am deeply concerned about 
thousands of families (including 126 families with small children) who will be 
literally out in the cold and homeless with no shelter and no options on Dec. 31.  This 
is just one example of the hardship and suffering for our neighbors that will unfold if 
LD3 does not pass. We look out for our neighbors in Maine. Please support LD3.
