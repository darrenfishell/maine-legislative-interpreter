This aid is much needed for Maine families who will certainly experience 
homelessness without these benefits, at the coldest time of the year no less. Or 
families and individuals will have to make the impossible choice between heat or 
food. All families and individuals should have a basic right to the ability to keep 
themselves safe, housed, warm, and fed. The entire county/world, and particularly 
more rural areas like Maine, is feeling the heavy weight of the pandemic, rising costs 
for basic necessities (including but certainly not limited to child care, housing, food, 
healthcare, transportation, and heat), inconsistent and unreliable transportation to 
schools/childcare, intense illnesses like RSV/COVID/influenza, crowded shelters, and
chronic underemployment - and it’s hard to know when to stop that list because 
unfortunately I could go on for paragraphs and paragraphs. Whether you’re looking at
the state, federal, or international level, there’s only so much progress we can make as
a people if some in that number don’t have their very basic needs met. We’re missing 
out on valuable social and economic contributions from people whose only focus has 
to be keeping themselves alive. If this assistance is not rendered, a decline in what 
should be a very basic quality of life for many Mainers is inevitable. Please do your 
part in keeping Maine families alive, warm, and housed. Thank you.
