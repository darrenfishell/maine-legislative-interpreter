I object to this bill and the wide range of income eligible persons who don't need heating 
assistance; $450 will not buy 100 gal. of oil; how pitiful is this?
The balance of the money appropriated for this bill is intended to house people who illegally 
entered this country and Maine citizens are being asked to pay for their hotel rooms. We are 
being overwhelmed with skyrocketing gas prices, cost to heat our rooms, electricity costs and 
basic food needs.  When are we going to say No!
