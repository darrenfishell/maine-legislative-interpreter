To Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross, and Members of the Appropriations 
and Financial Affairs Committee:
My name is Christina Cataldo. I am a pastor in Winthrop, Maine,  and I live in 
Sidney, Maine. I have personally seen how much people are struggling to afford to 
stay housed and warm this season. My church keeps a modest fund to help people pay
emergency bills. We are regularly getting calls with requests to help pay rent and 
heating and asking for help to cover emergency short term lodging in hotels. I spoke 
with one family recently that, due to health issues and changes in jobs, just couldn't 
afford their heating bill. This week, I've also spoken with someone who is actively 
homeless, living out of their undrivable car, because the shelters in Augusta are full. 
In fact, there are multiple families in the small town where I serve that are living in 
cars. We also recently helped another person who has been trying to find a job closer 
to home, but can't, and who is having a hard time affording rent because their gas bill 
is so much more than it used to be. While my church is happy to share what we can, 
we know the funds we share are simply a short-term fix. The state of Maine need 
some larger systemic support to address the crisis many of our neighbors are facing. 
We must choose to prevent the suffering of so many people. In order to love our 
neighbors, we must help them stay in safe and warm housing. And, it will take more 
money than small churches like mine can raise.
