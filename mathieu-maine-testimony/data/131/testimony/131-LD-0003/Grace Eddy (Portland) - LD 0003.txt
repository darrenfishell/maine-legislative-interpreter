TESTIMONY OF GRACE EDDY SUPPORTING LD 3
An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High
Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program
Wednesday, December 21, 2022
Augusta, Maine
Hello Representatives,
My name is Grace Eddy, and I am writing in
SUPPORT
of LD 3
. I live in Portland and
am a full time student and part time social worker. As our coldest months approach and living
costs remain high I believe LD 3 is incredibly important in ensuring that all Mainers have a safe
winter.
As a social worker, I work with people who experience poverty and housing insecurity. I
can testify that for people living on no, little or fixed incomes, programs like Emergency Rental
Assistance and LIHEAP are life savers. Funding for these programs keeps people safe, housed
and part of our communities. We canâ€™t forget that the people who access these programs are
some of our friends and family. We need to take care of each other.
LD 3 will expand access for heating assistance that would otherwise not be available to
many hard-working Mainers. We are all feeling the impact of increased energy bills and housing
costs. I know I am. As a student, my budget is tight. My last heat bill was almost double the
price I paid this time last year, it is stressful. Relief payments will be welcomed by myself and
other hard-working, deserving Maine residents. I urge you to pass this bill.
Respectfully,
Grace Eddy
