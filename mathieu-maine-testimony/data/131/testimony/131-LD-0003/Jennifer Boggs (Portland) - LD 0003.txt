Portland
LD 3
My name is Jen Boggs, and I live in Portland. As a mother, small business owner, 
citizen, Christian, and community member, I strongly urge you to pass LD3 as soon 
as you are able. Families, children, and older Mainers need to be warm and sheltered. 
The alternative is wrong -- and avoidable. Please do everything you can to help us, 
Maine citizens, to help one another, especially in the winter, especially in this season 
of hope and love.
Thank you, in advance, for doing the right thing!
