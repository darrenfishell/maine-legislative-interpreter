My name is Tobin Williamson and I live in Lewiston. I am asking you to pass the 
emergency legislation, and emphasizing the need to include both housing and heating 
funding in the package. The upcoming Maine winter season is a matter of life or death
for Maine people. With the end of the federal Emergency Rental Assistance program, 
hundreds of Maine households are at-risk of eviction. Heating costs are challenging 
Mainers' budgets like never before. We cannot turn our back on our fellow residents 
and leave them out in the cold (literally!). I encourage you to allocate resources for 
both heating assistance and housing assistance in this legislation without delay. Thank
you.
