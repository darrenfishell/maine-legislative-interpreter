President Jackson, Speaker Talbot  Ross, Distinguished Members of the Committee:  
My name is Alan Cobo -Lewis. I live in Orono.  
I am testifying neither for nor against LD 3, but against the deappropriations  from Home and 
Community Based Services (HCBS) accounts Z211, Z212, Z210, Z218, and Z217 —services for 
Mainers  with intellectual disability, autism, brain injury, and other related conditions . These 
deappropriations total $35.2 million ( 7.3% of what’s neces sary to support all the spending in LD 
3—see bar charts  in my testimony ). 
I have two 22 -year -old adult children, one of whom has a significant disability and is on the 
Section 21 waiver.  Because of the work force crisis, he went SEVEN MONTHS without a SING LE 
HOUR of HCBS -funded direct support.  
The support he did get came from private health insurance —because that reimbursed at a rate 
that, unlike MaineCare’s, was sufficient to pay wages that were competitive in today’s labor 
market.  
The 130th Legislature co nsidered a unanimous committee report to eliminate HCBS wait lists1—
but that bill died on the  table . As of September 2022, t here are 2,377  people on wait lists for 
HCBS , a 24% increase from three years earlier2. The money LD 3 take s out of HCBS could be 
used to address wait lists.  
The 130th Legislature didn’t touch the Section 21 wait list  (now grown to 2,028  people ). It didn’t 
touch the Section 18 wait list  (now 184 people ) or the Section 20 wait list (now 23 people ). And 
it just tread  water on the Section 29 wait list, so that still stands at 218 peop le—even though 
there was no Section 29 wait list at all for the 3.5 years leading up to the 2019 inauguration and 
the opening of the 129th Legislature ! 
The 130th Legislature also raised wa ges for direct care workers to 125% of minimum wage —a 
prepandemic recommendation that has proven noncompetitive in today’s labor market. The 
money being taken out of HCBS could be used to address direct support professional wages.  
The administration is tec hnically correct that the deappropriation of state HCBS money does 
not directly cut existing service  because it is backfilled with federal HCBS money —but only 
because existing HCBS services for Mainers with disabilities are not fully funded . Instead of 
using the additional federal HCBS funds to address waitlist and work force crises that covid has 
exacerbated, LD 3 is making a choice to redirect those HCBS funds to other uses.  
If you want to be an ally to Mainers with disabilities then please make a differe nt choice.  
The bar charts  in my testimony, prepared directly from the text of LD 3, reveal that the HCBS 
deappropriation could be eliminated with little impact on the desired expenditures. For 
 
1 LD 1360 in 130th Legislature as amended by Committee Amendment “A”

example, if you do the 
right thing and strike 
the deappropriation 
from HCBS , you  could 
leave the heating and 
housing aid intact and 
choose from among 
the following:  
• Lower the direct 
payments from 
$450 to $410  
• Keep the dir ect 
payments at $450 
and lower the 
income threshold 
slightly  
• Take the $35.2 
million from the 
surplus, if 
available.  
You also might 
consider an 
amendment along the 
lines of the 
Bennett/Groh oski 
proposal . 
Such actions would not 
solve the wait list and 
workforce crisis, but 
they would serve as a 
needed down payment 
on addressing those 
crises that the existing 
budget and LD 3 leave 
unsolved. Then you 
could use budget bills 
in the rest of session to 
finish the  job in the 
next biennium.
