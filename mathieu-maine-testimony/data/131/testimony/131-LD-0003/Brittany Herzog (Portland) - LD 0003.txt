I am a resident of the City of Portland and I am adding my written testimony to 
support the passage of this bill. Maine winters are harsh as we all know. We cannot sit
ideally by as our fellow citizens are freezing due to lack of shelter or heating 
assistance. I urge everyone regardless of political beliefs to support this bill. This is 
about human decency.
