LD 3 - An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating 
Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program
I SUPPORT LD 3, in particular the Emergency Rental Assistance program. Without this assistance the 
homeless population of Maine will grow significantly, even as the coldest months arrive. My faith has 
called me to assist people who likely would have become unhoused had Rental Assistance not been 
available. It is so apparent that this assistance is needed until longer term solutions are in place.
Respectfully, 
Marjorie Titcomb, Yarmouth Maine
