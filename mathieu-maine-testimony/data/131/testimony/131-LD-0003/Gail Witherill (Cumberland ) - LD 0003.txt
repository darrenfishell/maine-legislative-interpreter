Chairpersons Jackson and  Talbot-Ross and esteemed members of the Appropriations and 
Financial Affairs Committee,
I am writing today to express my firm support for LD 3, the emergency bill regarding heating 
and housing assistance and urge your passage of the emergency bill as soon as possible.  
Winter is here and the cost of heating fuel and electricity has become a larger burden than 
usual due to market factors.  Families are having to make tough choices between heating, 
food and rental costs. They need help.  Housing is in crisis mode in Maine and there are few 
options for families and elders who find themselves evicted.  In the Portland area, there are 
over a hundred families that will be evicted from area hotels that have been used as overflow 
housing. Neighbors try to take care of neighbors and faith communities and non profit 
organizations have been scrambling to find housing options, but itâ€™s not enough.  Help is 
needed from the state.  All over Maine there are families, veterans. elderly that are facing 
eviction due to the discontinuation of federal ERA funds or lack of GA funding.  We can get 
through this if the state of Maine steps up to help with much needed funds to get us through 
this crisis.  Please vote Yes on LD3.  The funds are imperative to keep people safe this 
winter.
Sincerely,
Gail Witherill
