Re: Testimony in favor of LD 3: An Act To Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program

Program 
____________________________________________________________________________
Senate President Jackson, Speaker Talbot Ross, and members of the Committee on 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs. My name is Jess Falero. I am a resident in Portland, Maine 
and the Climate Justice Co-Coordinator for both Maine Youth For Climate Justice and Maine 
Climate Action NOW! I’m also the founder of Maine People’s Housing Coalition as well as the 
Harm Reduction Outreach specialist for the Church of Safe Injection. The work I do crosses the  
intersections of Housing, mental health care, substance use disorder, and climate change.  I am 
writing in support of LD 3: An Act To Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to 
Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment 
Program. 
In the middle of an unprecedented housing crisis Emergency Rental Relief and high heating 
costs, it is our legislators responsibility to pass emergency funds to those in highest need. As 
someone who has lived in this state for 8 years after aging out of the foster care system in 
Connecticut, I hold many experiences of what it means to sleep outside during the winter, sleep 
inside with no heat, and lose friends due to freezing temperatures. I hope my vulnerability in the 
next couple paragraphs will fill you with the urgency that we know is not only necessary but has 
already been present for those highly impacted and those who support them. 
After spending nearly a decade in foster care, I was moved to Maine and promptly ended up on 
the streets of Lewiston. I had just arrived to the state a measly 4 months previously and was 
completely new to the area. Shortly after I ended up at Hope Haven Homeless Mission, I was 
sexually assaulted by a man who lived on the second floor.
I was then sent  to Portland to the teen shelter where I would find myself unhoused for the better 
half of 6 years. From the teen shelter, to the Florence House Women's shelter I would be 
trafficked, sexually assaulted two more times, sleep in the snow, among many other 
traumatizing things that our most vulnerable face. 
At 21 I found housing in the outskirts of the Portland area, but oil was too expensive for us to 
afford. Which meant that I would have to dress in layers, under multiple blankets and still shiver 
down to my bones. During this time I remember calling the crisis hotline. I was so cold that I just 
wanted to die. The crisis worker would come to my house, sit on a stool in my bedroom and ask 
me what it is that I am struggling with, all while wearing his jacket because of how cold it was in 
the house. By the end of the visit he recognized there wasn’t anything he could do for me, 
because the one thing I needed was heating assistance. This would then cause me to go back 
into homelessness and sleeping in the park because the Women's Shelter did not have a bed 
open and the Oxford Street shelter is extremely unsafe. 
In March of 2021 I got a call around 10 in the morning.  My friend Joy Cyr was found frozen to 
death on the sidewalk of a 7-11. 
In all of these experiences there's more to be talked about, not only from what I’ve faced trying 
to make my way in this society but from the many stories like mine. The crisis is real, the need 
has been here, and the compounding factors of inflation and the pandemic have exacerbated 
the problem. If this bill is not passed more folks are going to be layering up in their homes, 
shivering uncontrollably under multiple blankets at risk of homelessness or death. 
It's never been a moral failing but a systemic failure that we force our most vulnerable people to 
endure such trauma that folks like you couldn't begin to understand. So believe us when we say 
the emergency is real. I urge you to vote yes on LD 3 and save lives this winter.
