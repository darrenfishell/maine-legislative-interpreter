Testimony Against LD 3: An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid 
Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program.  
Speaker Talbot Ross, President Jackson, Members of the Appropriations Committee, 
My name is Eric McVay, and I am a self-advocate from Bangor, Maine, a member of different self-advocacy 
organizations including Speaking Up For Us, the Self-Advocate Faculty for Maine Lend, and a board member 
at Disability Rights Maine.  
Please accept this written testimony against LD 3 “An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment 
Program.”
Thank you to the committee.  I am here to testify in opposition of LD 3.   I do not feel we should be taking 
money out of the funds for Home and Community Based Services for People with Disabilities.  Especially at a 
time when providers are struggling to hire and retain staff.  Also, the fact that we have years long waitlists of 
people waiting to receive services.  My belief is that this money is earmarked for people receiving services and 
can not be replaced.  Contrary to what the governor is saying these funds are earmarked for a specific purpose.  
I would urge ought not to pass on LD 3.  
I would also ask the committee to look at alternatives to fund Home and Community Based Services to reduce 
waitlists and hire support staff.   
Sincerely,
Eric McVay
