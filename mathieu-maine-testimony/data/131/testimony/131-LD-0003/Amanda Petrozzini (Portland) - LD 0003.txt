LD 3
Hello, my name is Amanda Petrozzini ,and I live in Portland. I am deeply concerned 
about thousands of families (including 126 families with small children) who will be 
literally out in the cold and homeless with no shelter and no options on Dec. 31. This 
is just one example of the hardship and suffering for our neighbors that will unfold if 
LD-3 does not pass. Please help these families. Thank you in advance for doing the 
right thing and pass LD-3!
