LD 3
Dear members of the Appropriations committee, 
There's not much I can say that others haven't said.  
Simply put, you have to work something out & pass LD 3, or something very much like it, very
soon.   
The alternative is letting people freeze.  
Those are your choices.    
Don't let people freeze.  It's a bad way to die.
Sincerely, 
~Winston
