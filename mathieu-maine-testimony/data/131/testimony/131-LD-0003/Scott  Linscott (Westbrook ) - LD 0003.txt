As a pastor in Westbrook, I see elderly and low income people going without food 
and medicine and other essentials . Added to the stress of increasing housing costs, I 
see members of my congregation truly struggling.
I was in shock when legislators stood against the emergency bill providing real and 
necessary help to our families and those on the edge of homelessness. How I wish I 
could get them to look in the deep brown eyes of a precious child and tell them they 
do not deserve shelter.
Please ACT and ACT NOW! Hosting public hearings and dragging this out until until
June on procedural grounds leaves the people you were elected to represent high and 
dry.
