My name is Rev. Sara Gavit and I am the priest serving St. Anne’s Episcopal 
Church and the people of Calais.  I strongly support LD3 and encourage our 
elected lawmakers to do all they can to provide emergency aid to those in 
need.  
In the past three days, the church received six requests for fuel assistance. 
That’s six families – our neighbors, families, and friends – who don’t have 
enough money to heat their homes.  Almost every day since mid-November, I 
have received pleas for help. People sign up for HEAP, and yet don’t have 
interviews until January or February. The situation is particularly dire this 
winter due to high fuel oil costs, as well as other economic stressors. The folks 
who ask for help are desperate. Elders on fixed incomes, folks with 
disabilities, families with young children, are struggling the most.  The most 
vulnerable members of our community. People are making hard choices 
between buying food and medicine, paying rent, or adding a few gallons of 
fuel oil to the tanks.    
  
The people of Washington County take care of one another and, if they can, 
make donations to fuel funds available through churches, food pantries and 
non-profits.  It still isn’t enough. The need for assistance is much greater than 
the resources available. 
As a faith leader, as a mother and grandmother, I implore you to help the 
people of Maine who need the most support. The health of our neighbors and 
the health of our communities in which we live, requires all of us working 
together.  Please do your part and pass emergency relief measures.
Respectfully,
Rev. Sara Gavit
