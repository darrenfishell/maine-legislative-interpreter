Where do you all get your arbitrary income amounts and levels? Low income 
households are not the only ones that pay for heat and other increased expenses.  
What about the middle-class households that are still having trouble paying for heat 
and electric make too much to qualify for assistance programs like LIHEAP, SNAP, 
etc? Yes, those like me may have two cars, two cats, and a home are paid for by two 
working adults with medium-level income, but we still need to stay warm and pay for 
electric.
Many low-income households are renters, where the cost of heat and such is usually 
included in the rent. Yes, there are some that must pay, and like other, should get 
some help, but those that do not have a resource that is unavailable to the rest.
I hate to be the elephant in the room, but the middle-class MUST have a voice. Those 
of us that aren't rich, and those of us that are not low-income and qualify for the slew 
of other assistance sources out there can use help as well. From skyrocketing 
expenses, fuel costs, taxes... we get little to no reprieve because we either do not make
enough to have a buffer in our bank accounts, or we make just too much to qualify for
any help.
