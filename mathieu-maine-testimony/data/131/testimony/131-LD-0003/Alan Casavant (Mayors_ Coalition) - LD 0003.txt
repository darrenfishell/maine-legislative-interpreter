  Testimony in Support of LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program  December 21, 2022   President Jackson, Speaker Talbot Ross and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs,  The Mayors’ Coalition is a nonpartisan group representing the Mayors of ten Maine communities – Auburn, Augusta, Biddeford, Lewiston, Portland, Rockland, Saco, Sanford, South Portland and Westbrook. The Coalition advocates on behalf of our citizens and municipalities for policies that recognize the vital services Maine cities provide and the positive impact Maine cities have on our state. The Coalition seeks to work in partnership with state elected officials to meet the needs of Maine people.   We are writing in support of LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program. As you’re all well aware, LD 3 comes at a critical time for so many Maine families with winter weather setting in and energy costs continuing to rise. This bill will provide essential assistance – as well as welcome relief – to people all across our state. It will also provide emergency housing support for Maine residents seeking shelter in these cold winter months.   We appreciate the urgency with which you are addressing these pressing needs. While we support LD 3, we remain concerned about funding for existing programs and encourage the state to fully meet its statutory obligations.  Thank you for your work on this important legislation. Please let us know if we can be of assistance as LD 3 moves forward.
