My name is Georgia West I live in Caribou, and I am a self-advocate.  I oppose LD3.  I have lived in this 
state for 10 years and itâ€™s not fair to take money from the HCBS Maine Care fund.  This is a necessary 
fund for the people that the HCBS fund serves and who should have more of a say about how the money 
is spent. 
ACAP has helped me with my rent and that has been very helpful which made my money more available 
to spend on other living costs.  We should find another avenue to pay for heating assistance.  
Thank You,
Georgia West
