I am opposed to "robbing Peter to pay Paul" to fund this bill.  Proposing to take 
money away from the Maincare Home and Community Based Service Waivers 
(HCBS) which supports Mainers with Autism, intellectual disabilities (Section 21/29),
brain disorders (Section 18) and other related conditions (Section 20), is unjust.
While my adult child receives funding under Section 29,  I know there are many less 
fortunate families that are struggling and need supports unavailable to them due to 
lack of funding.  A much better plan is to use waiver funding to address the ever 
increasing wait lists.
I encourage you to reject reappropriating funds allocated to the Maincare HCBS 
Waivers so these funds can be used to help reduce the wait lists.
