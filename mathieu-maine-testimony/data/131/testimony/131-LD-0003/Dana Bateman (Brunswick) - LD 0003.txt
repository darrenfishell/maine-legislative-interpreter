LD 3
Dear Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee: 
I am writing to urge you to pass LD3.  Here in Brunswick, families are struggling with high 
costs related to heating, rent, and overall cost of living. This bill is necessary to keep children 
safely housed, and could help stabilize situations for those who may lose their housing. 
Please vote yes to assist so many friends, neighbors and coworkers who need this help!
