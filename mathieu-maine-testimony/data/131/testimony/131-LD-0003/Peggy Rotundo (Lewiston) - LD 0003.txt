Testimony in support of LD 3 “An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program”
President Jackson, Speaker Talbot Ross, and distinguished members of the Legislature’s 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Peggy Rotundo and I proudly 
represent the people of Lewiston in Senate District 21.
I am here today to testify in support of LD 3, an emergency measure that would provide 
direct heating and housing relief to Mainers. When I was going door-to-door to meet my 
constituents throughout the fall, I was told countless times that we needed to do something 
about housing and heating costs. This issue affects every one of our communities, and the 
people who have chosen us to represent them need our help now more than ever. 
Mainers need relief, and while this proposal is not perfect, it will allow us to provide that 
relief immediately. This bill has strong bipartisan support, and is a testament of compromise 
that will allow us to aid our constituents. With this in mind, I urge to you all to vote ought to 
pass on LD 3. Thank you.
Margaret R. Rotundo
State Senator
