Sass Borodkin
Skowhegan
LD 3
Good afternoon Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross, and Members of the 
Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee,
My name is Sass Borodkin, I’m from Skowhegan, and I’m offering this testimony to 
implore you to pass LD 3 - An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program. When I fill the front of my grocery cart where 
kids usually sit I’m getting to the cash register and finding my bill hovering closer to 
$100. I live alone, and this is the bill for just me and my two cats weekly. The price of
everything has gone way up while wages have remained largely stagnant. My propane
bill last week was for $400, which is how I heat my house and my water, and I 
anticipate another coming before the end of January, which will be right around the 
same amount, if not more because it’s getting colder. Because of the need for 
electricity to be pumping the heat out my most recent electric bill was over $200! This
is not a sustainable way to get through the cold season, and I could really use this 
help. This money will come from a surplus in the state’s budget, and I can’t really 
think of a better way to spend that money than to give it back to your constituents 
who are literally looking at freezing to death without some help. As it is we watched 
rent relief end right as the cold season was beginning. Please use the money we’ve 
paid into you to help keep us warm by passing LD 3. Thanks for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Sass Borodkin
