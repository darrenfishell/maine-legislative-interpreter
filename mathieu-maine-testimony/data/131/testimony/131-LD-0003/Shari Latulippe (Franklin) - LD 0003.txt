LD 3
Good Afternoon Appropriations and Affairs Committee,
I would like to share my thoughts regarding LD 3, the Emergency 
Heating Assistance Bill.
I am particularly concerned with the proposal  to send $450.00 
dollar checks to people to assist with heating and utility expenses,
regardless of their income level.
All the money for this proposal should be appropriated to existing
heating assistance programs and other qualifying programs, so
that those who are truly in need of help with heating expenses
will benefit.
As proposed by Senators Nicole Grohoski and Rick Bennet, 
lowering the income thresholds to qualify for assistance is a very
good idea, to avoid money being sent to households who do not
need help paying their heating bills.
As an example, We do not have any oil or gas appliances and heat our house with a new, 
very efficient wood stove.  And our electricity
is supplied by 16 grid-tied solar panels. Sending us a check for
$450.00 dollars would be silly and a waste of resources, which 
would take away from someone who truly needs assistance.
Sincerely
Shari Latulippe,    Franklin, Maine
