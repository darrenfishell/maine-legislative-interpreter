Hi, I am Regina Bowie I live in Presque Isle, and I am a self-advocate.  I oppose LD 3. 
I feel we need to save the money in the HCBS Maine Care fund and have that go to Direct Service 
Providers and the people that receive services through the waiver programs. We need to focus on Direct 
Service Providers and pay them a competitive wage as well as address the wait list for waiver programs.
Thank You, 
Regina Bowie
