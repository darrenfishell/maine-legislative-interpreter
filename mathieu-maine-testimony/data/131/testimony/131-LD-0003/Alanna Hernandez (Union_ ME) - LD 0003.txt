LD 3
Hello,
I am a resident of Union, ME. I am writing to ask you to consider quickly passing 
LD3 to provide emergency housing relief to Mainers. The housing crisis that is 
happening everywhere is in full force here in Maine. I have worked in the public 
schools in my area and can see firsthand how families and kids are struggling to stay 
in stable living environments. High rent costs are making basic housing unaffordable 
to the working class, especially those working in service positions that are so badly in 
need of workers right now. If you work one of those essential jobs, it is so hard to 
afford rent on your own, let alone if you have kids. I could go on and on and on about 
the importance of stable environments for children, working full time and still not 
affording rent, but mostly I just want you to know that this problem is very real for so 
many Mainers.
Of course, the root causes of the housing crisis will need to be discussed and 
addressed to fully solve this problem, but for now, I am asking you to pass LD3 for 
emergency housing relief to keep families off the street for now. As soon as humanly 
possible.
Thank you,
