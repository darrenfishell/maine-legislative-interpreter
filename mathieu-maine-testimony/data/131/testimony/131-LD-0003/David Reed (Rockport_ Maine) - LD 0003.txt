LD 3
Emergency Maine Legislative Bill LD 3, “An Act to Provide Funding for Winter 
Emergency Energy Relief and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment 
Program.”  Sponsors Troy Jackson and Talbot Ross.  We urge that Bill LD 3 not be 
passed as an emergency measure, but be resubmitted as two separate measures. The 
bill allocates some $50 million to send a $450 energy relief check to qualified Maine 
households, but the total price tag for the bill is $445 million! Only 10% of the bill 
goes to alleviating actual heating fuel expenses. The remaining $400 million goes to 
other non-emergency projects. To attempt to ram this bill through as an emergency is 
a disgrace, and thoughtful legislators who put on the brakes are to be commended. 
Our legislators should be creative enough to legitimately split off the $50 million for 
emergency fuel relief. The remainder needs to be sent back to committee for review 
and systematic deliberation. Bill sponsors have hijacked an emergency measure to 
enact a massive spending bill that pushes many nonemergency pet projects, 
essentially holding needy Maine families hostage to an egregious abuse of their 
emergency legislative powers.
