To the Honorable Members of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee:
I am writing in support of LD3: An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid 
Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program.
My husband and I live in Westbrook, Maine. We own our home and thankfully are not at risk of a 
landlord suddenly increasing our rent or telling us we have to move within a month. Looking back over 
our life, we can remember a time when one of us was unemployed and an extended family member 
paid our home mortgage for a year. Most people do not have the financial support we had nor do they 
have the personal reserves to deal with periods of unemployment, fluctuating rent and energy costs. We 
are all subject to forces beyond our control and my require help from government programs.
To be without shelter in Maine in the winter with very limited housing available and homeless shelters 
strained or full is a cruel and deadly situation. We would not allow that for our worst criminal 
offenders, and yet families with children are facing the prospect.
I implore you to swiftly pass LD3. Legislation is a moral statement.  I'd like to believe we care about 
the people living within our state and will work together to help those in crisis.
