LD 3
Winter officially arrives in Maine today. This brings with it cold and rainy / snowy weather. 
These conditions make the possibility of hypothermia acute, especially for those who are very
young, elderly or infirm. We have thousands of Mainers who are challenged to stay warm and
dry. There very lives are in our hands. They need LD3 to survive.
Please keep us all safe. 
Sincerely,
Rev, Ann O'Sullivan
