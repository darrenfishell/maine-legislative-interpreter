LD 3
As a native Mainer, mother, and pediatric nurse, I feel called to write to you today 
regarding LD3 and my hope that there will be reconsideration for emergency funding 
for housing before the winter break. 
As a nurse, I am all too familiar with the effect of homelessness or housing insecurity 
on children and their families.  It leads to a wide array of physical and psychological 
damage.  As I hear stories about mothers with infant babies sleeping in tents or on the 
street while it snows outside, I feel helpless.  There are only so many tents, sleeping 
bags, coats, and warmth kits I can supply as one person.  
I understand the importance of a budget and balancing funds and the impetus placed 
upon you to make good choices for your constituents, but I simply can't shake the 
feeling that this is not at all the way things should be playing out.  Those afflicted 
with homelessness are often parents working three jobs at a time, "the working poor." 
They are those afflicted with disease (mental or psychiatric), drug addicts, those who 
have fallen down on their luck, veterans.
Did you know the average lifespan of a homeless person is 48 years old?  Such an 
absolute shame. Inflation and costs of oil have made life unbearably difficult for 
many of us, even those of us with good wages.  We need to have compassion for our 
neighbors in need, especially in the winter in Maine.  I beg you to push for 
reconsideration of this funding before the winter break.
