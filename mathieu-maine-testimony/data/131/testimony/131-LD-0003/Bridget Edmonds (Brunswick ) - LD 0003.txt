LD 3
I am writing to ask for your help in supporting Maine’s families everywhere in 
keeping them housed this winter by supporting LD3. My kids and I live in Brunswick,
and we already see tents set up in the woods in our neighborhood. There isn’t enough 
housing, and what exists is too expensive. Please help families stay where they are 
this winter to avoid sending folks into the cold over Christmas. It would be utterly 
traumatizing to children at a time of year that should be safe and magical. Please 
show them how much you care by passing legislation immediately to keep them 
safely in their homes this winter.
Thank you,
