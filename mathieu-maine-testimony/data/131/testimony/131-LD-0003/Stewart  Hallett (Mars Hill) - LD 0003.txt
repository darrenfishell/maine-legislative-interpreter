My name is Stewart Hallett, I live in Mars Hill, and I am a self-advocate. I oppose LD 3
I think it’s wrong for people to take money from day programs. I think our program would be shut down 
if we didn’t have enough staff.  It’s important to help people that need help heating their homes, but we 
should find a different way to pay for it.
Thank You, 
Stewart Hallett
