   TESTIMONY of Megan Diver                        Vice President Maine Energy Marketers Association   BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee In SUPPORT to LD 3  President Jackson, Speaker Talbot Ross , and members of the (temporary) Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, my name is Megan Diver, I am the Vice President of the Maine Energy Marketers Association (MEMA).  MEMA is a trade association composed of approximately 300-member companies and over 5,000 direct and 5,000 indirect people working in energy delivery and servicing businesses delivering heating oil, biofuels, motor fuels, propane, pellets and kerosene and offering service and installations on the equipment that operates these fuels. In addition, our members own and operate 70% of Maine's 1,300 convenience stores in Maine and employ approximately 10,000 Maine people and sell more than 1 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel each year. Our members also sell more than 90% of all the propane sold in our state every year. We provide education and training to the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, weatherization, and energy auditing trades for hundreds of Maine citizens annually through our courses at our own state of the art training facility MEMA Technical Education Center (MTEC) in Brunswick.  MEMA is committed to working to ensure that all Mainers have access to the fuels necessary to ensure their warmth and safety.  Many Mainers will appreciate and benefit from this, especially those on fixed-incomes, as well as and fuel retailers who have been working tirelessly to ensure all who they serve have the heating fuels they need this winter season.  As we navigate our way through these challenging times, the men and women of the Maine Energy Marketers Association remain steadfast in their commitment to provide the citizens of Maine with safe, reliable, liquid heating fuels. We ask that the committee not hesitate to contact us if we can be a resource to them going forward.   MEMA would also like to recognize and support Sec. E-1.  38 MRSA ยง603-A, sub-ยง7-A. The Emergency variance giving the commissioner, without hearing, authority to suspend any of the sulfur content requirements of subsection 2 if the commissioner finds that the expected availability of fuel that complies with those requirements is inadequate to meet the needs of residential, commercial or 

industrial users in this State and that such expected unavailability constitutes an immediate threat to public health, safety or the general welfare.    Thank you to all.
