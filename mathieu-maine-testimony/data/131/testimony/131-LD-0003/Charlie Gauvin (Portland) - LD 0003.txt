The funds to support ongoing emergency rental assistance and shelter solutions are of 
critical importance to ensure that Mainers who have been able to find temporary or 
transitional housing with emergency support will not be forced out onto the street at 
the harshest time of year to be unhoused. Many of the most vulnerable individuals and
families are facing homelessness in the coming months without sufficient emergency 
housing assistance have come to Maine to exercise their human right to seek asylum 
and should not be exposed to the dangerous experience of homelessness in Maine 
winters for being here to do that. The federal rent relief and assistance programs that 
were put in place during the pandemic were able to kick the can down the road, so to 
speak, with regards to the affordable housing crisis in Maine, but it is time now for 
our state legislators to address the lack of availability and affordability of housing 
with a meaningful legislative response, and passing this bill would be a very 
important first step to doing so.
