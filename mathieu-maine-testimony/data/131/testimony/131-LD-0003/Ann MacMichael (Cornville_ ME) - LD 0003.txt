I will say I was flabbergasted that the energy assistance bill was originally written to give 
checks to people earning $100,000/year or couples earning $200,000/year. Those salaries 
should enable people to live comfortably without financial “assistance.”
Those earnings are far above my social security sole income of slightly over $20,000. If I can 
“get by,” the people earning those salaries should certainly be able to make do.
Thank you for your part in making the revised bill more reasonable.
