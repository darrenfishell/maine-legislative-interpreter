Vernon Lickfeld
Lisbon
LD 3
My name is Vernon Lickfeld. I am a resident of Lisbon. I am writing this afternoon to
express my disappointment with the Maine Senate's failure to pass emergency relief 
despite bipartisan and public support and to plead for reconsideration on the 
upcoming vote for LD 3. 
The statement given from the Republican party to justify blocking this 
initiative--citing the lack of a public hearing, committee discussion, or long-term 
solution--is utter hogwash. Not only is this decision nakedly partisan, it is one that 
could cost much more than its proposed expense. Without crucial support, the cost for
heating the homes of Maine's poorest and oldest families will be an impossible task 
this winter. 
I cannot imagine being so devoid of a conscience as to vote down a bill because of the
view that it is "a bandaid on a gaping wound," when that wound is one that is felt 
globally and can in no way be remedied in its entirety by the Maine state legislature. 
It is senseless to pooh-pooh a bandaid because a doctor with stitches MIGHT be 
coming soon, or the bleeding MIGHT stop on its own. It is altogether another 
scapegoating of the governor's office by the GOP, suggesting that she is at once solely
responsible for the high price of heating oil but irresponsible when it comes to 
remedying it. 
I want to remind those senators who voted down LD 1 that they do not arrive in 
Augusta on magic carpets. They are sent to represent their neighbors, many of whom 
will freeze to death in their homes this winter without the support offered by LD 3. I 
generously hope that this concept was merely forgotten by the senators who voted no 
or didn't show up; I would be devastated if it was a deliberate callousness and 
disregard for constituents' wellbeing.
Thank you for your time. Happy holidays. I hope those of you hearing these 
statements today are able to stay warm.
