Judith Brown
Freeport Community Services
LD 3
I write as a concerned neighbor, board member of Freeport Community Services, member of 
South Freeport Congregational Church, and proud native Mainer. I urge you to vote to pass 
LD-3. 
As we do to the least of our neighbors, so do we reveal the true  nature of our own hearts. 
May Mainers lead the way in demonstrating our commitment to justice: acting boldly -- with 
responsibility, caring and concern for all. 
May we speak this in one sweet chorus. Amen.
