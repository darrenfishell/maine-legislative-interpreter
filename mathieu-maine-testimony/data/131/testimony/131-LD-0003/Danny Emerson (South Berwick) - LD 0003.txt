I oppose LD 3 in its current form (An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic 
Relief Payment Program), and it ought not to pass unless amended.
I understand this bill provides one-time funding to support emergency housing and 
emergency shelters to prevent people from experiencing homelessness this winter. I 
would expect this bill to be amended to apply to legal Maine residents and legally 
processed asylum seekers only.
I understand there will be relief funds distributed to eligible households to offset the 
exorbitant high costs of energy to heat our homes. I would expect this bill to be 
amended to provided accountability for any funds issued. These funds are for heating 
assistance, not alcohol, drugs, big screen TVs, etc. Period.
What is the legislature going to do to fix the problems causing you to throw money at 
us? What are the long-term solutions? The current administration, both Federal and 
state, are killing the fossil fuel industry, causing this mess. What are you going to do?
Why are our taxes so high? Why is there extra money for you to “give” to us? How 
about tax reform? I want the opportunity to keep my own money, and due what I want 
with it, not wait for the state to give me a few crumbs back!
Again, I oppose LD 3 in its current form (An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief 
Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program), and it ought not to pass unless amended to fix the 
above problems.
