Dear Members of the Committee for Appropriations and Financial Affairs
This bill makes me very angry, and I strongly encourage you to recommend that this 
bill ought not to pass.  
I understand that a lot of Maine Citizens will have difficulty paying for heat this 
winter, but I believe that this bill will do little to solve the problem.  Just sending out a
check to everyone who meets the criteria of the bill is reckless and does not make 
sense.  Providing $450 to individuals will not solve the problem. Yes, a lot of people 
will be happy to receive the money, but $450 will not go far when paying for heat and
most of intended recipients according to the bill can just tighten their belts a little and 
deal with it.   The people that are at risk will need more than $450, but this bill will 
not ensure they get the help they need.   
 I recommend that if you determine who truly needs the assistance and then target 
only those people and use the same process that is used now to provide heating 
assistance.  
Maine citizens deserve better than this poorly constructed bill that appears to be more 
of an income redistribution bill or a buy a vote bill, than a bill targeted to solve a 
problem.  
Sincerely,
John Jansen
