LD 3
I submit that I am in favor of this bill, LD3. With winter upon us in the midst of 
inflation and the rising cost of living, it is imperative that we make heating assistance 
available.  Lives and good health are at risk here and this is not a bill for which we 
neeed to be conservative or frugal.
Please pass this legislation, and our neighbors.
My thanks to you.
