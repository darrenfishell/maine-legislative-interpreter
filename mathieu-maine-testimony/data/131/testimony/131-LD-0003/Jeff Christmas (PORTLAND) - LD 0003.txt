As a Maine resident I am deeply concerned about thousands of families (including 
126 families with small children) who will be literally out in the cold and homeless 
with no shelter and no options on Dec. 31. This is unacceptable in our state. Please do
what is right and pass this act to protect "the least of these" our neighbors and friends.
