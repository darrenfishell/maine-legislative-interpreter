Testimony Against LD 3: An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid 
Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program.  
Speaker Talbot Ross, President Jackson, Members of the Appropriations Committee, 
My name is Jon McGovern, and I am a self-advocate from Bangor, Maine and a staff member at Speaking Up 
For Us.
Please accept this written testimony against LD 3 “An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment 
Program.”
Thank you to the committee.  I am writing to testify in opposition of LD 3. I would like to see the money for 
HCBS stay where it is to help people on waiver services.  I would like to see the legislature find a different 
solution.   
I want to see people come off the waitlists and get services.  Taking the money from the waivers will make it so 
people will keep waiting. I think we should look at making heating costs cheaper to help people out. 
While heating aid is important, I would urge the legislature to find funding elsewhere.  
I would ask you not to pass LD 3.  
Sincerely,
Jon McGovern
