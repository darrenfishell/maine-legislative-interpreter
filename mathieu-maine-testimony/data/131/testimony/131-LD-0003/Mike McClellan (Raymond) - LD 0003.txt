Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross and the Appropriations Committee 
Members:
I live in Raymond, Maine and am a former Maine House member. I appreciate this 
opportunity for public comment but see this bill as a band aid, given the problems in 
Maine are much bigger. As to this bill, I recently filled a partial tank of heating fuel 
and it cost over $900. While $450 of taxpayer supplied money would pay some of 
that, it is not a solution. As a former program director for street programs, I know of 
many instances where people received targeted support (like this proposal) and then 
used it for other uses, not what was targeted.
It is my dream that this legislature come in and decide to do things differently, not 
post 2,000 new (proposed) laws and go through the motions. Imagine the leadership 
that would pick 5(?) Maine issues (such as Energy, Housing, Infrastructure-school 
buildings and bridges, homelessness and  say...our youth leaving). Then seek to solve 
these issues.
It would be outside the box for sure. I again thank you for this public hearing but am hopeful 
this will not be a business as usual year.
I and many others are praying for you!
Mike
