LD 3
I strongly support LD 3. Many families with young children are struggling to make 
ends meet after the pandemic closures, and our limited housing options leave many 
with difficult or awful choices. I urge the Legislature to help families, especially those
with young children who need stability and warmth this winter. We are blessed as a 
state to have a surplus and these expenditures make sense at this time.
