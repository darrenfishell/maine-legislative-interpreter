Good afternoon, Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Appropriations an Financial Affairs,
My name is Simonne Maline.  I am the Executive Director for the Consumer Council System of Maine 
(CCSM). I am writing on behalf of the CCSM to testify neither for nor against on LD 3 “An Act to 
Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and 
to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program.”
The Consumer Council System of Maine is a public instrumentality written into State Statute by the Maine 
Legislature to serve in an advisory capacity and to provide legislators with guidance and advice regarding 
the delivery of effective and appropriate adult mental health services from those served by them.
The CCSM heartily supports helping Maine residents defray mounting heating costs but, we are opposed 
to the fact that a significant amount of money for this proposal is to be paid for by funds originally allocated 
to other needed programs such as the Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for Mainers with an 
intellectual/developmental disability, autism, brain injury, and other related conditions. As it stands now, it is 
our understanding there is a long wait list for individuals who are eligible for these services. We would urge 
you to look for other monetary sources to help people who are needing assistance with heating costs.
We also would ask that you be mindful of renters who have heating included, but despite that their rent has 
been increased significantly which puts a financial burden on them as well.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Simonne Maline
Executive Director
