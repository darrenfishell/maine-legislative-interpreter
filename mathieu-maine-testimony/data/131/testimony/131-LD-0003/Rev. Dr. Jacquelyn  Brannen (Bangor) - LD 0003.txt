My name is Rev. Dr. Jacquelyn Brannen and I serve as the District Superintendent of 
the New England Conference of the United Methodist Church. As followers of Christ,
we have been taught to love our neighbor as ourselves. I can think of no need more 
basic than safe housing and for those who find themselves unable to access that, I 
think it is the duty and privledge for those of us who have all we nee,  to provide for 
them. If the pandiemic has taught us anything, it is that hardship can come to anyone 
of us. It is by God's grace that many of us have our basic needs met this year. For 
those who do not, I hope that we fellow citizens are compelled to lend a hand. I know 
that society benefits and is raised to a higher level when our lowest citizens are raised 
up. Please help us all by supporting this bill.
