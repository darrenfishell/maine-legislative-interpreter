Heating oil prices are driving out young, middle income residents like myself and my 
family. We choose to live here despite being able to make more money in similar 
positions in almost any other state, despite being taxed at a higher rate than many 
other states, and despite having to pay extra bills (such as heating oil) that would be 
much lower or non existent in other states. Heating pil prices are nearly 75% higher 
than they were the last time crude oil was at a comparable price to what it is right 
now. So until both the Maine government and the federal government can stand up to 
companies price gouging regular American citizens, you owe us some relief in the 
form of our tax money coming back to us. Until that happens this state will continue 
to lose young, skilled workers, becoming older and older, and relying more and more 
on tourism than ever before. This state is collapsing quickly and changes need to be 
made. Also Veto that useless flag. No one wants it.
