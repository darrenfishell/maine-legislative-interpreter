Supports LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief 
Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to 
Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program
December 20, 2022
Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross, ladies and 
gentlemen of the Joint Committee of Appropriations  and Financial 
Affairs, I am Donna M. Kelley LCSW, President and CEO of Waldo 
Community Action Partners and President of Maine Community 
Action Partnership, and we support LD 3 An Act to Establish the 
Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High 
Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief 
Payment Program.
For more than 50 years, Community Action has served as a 
dynamic and community-based force in addressing the causes 
and conditions of poverty throughout Maine and the country. Our 
ten Community Action Agencies (CAAs) deliver programs and 
services for people with low and moderate income, including the 
Home Energy Assistance Program, or HEAP; workforce 
development; the Emergency Rental Relief program; Head Start / 
Early Head Start, childcare and more.
This bill will allow our most vulnerable Mainers to stay warm this 
winter and ensure a warm and safe place to be for others who 
have no place to go. Unfortunately, many in our in great state of 
Maine live on fixed incomes which do not meet the most basic of 
household needs. Many of our fixed income and low-income 
households are our most vulnerable community members 
including those living on social security, disability, or in low-income 
households including many families with children. There is no 
other time in the year when the impact of those low incomes is felt 
more than winter in Maine. 
Your local Community Action Agencies have seen an increase 
demand for Heating Assistance in the last few months and the 
need is increasing as we get further into the colder months of the 
season. Currently over 1000 individuals and families including 
those with children are in hotels previously supported by 
Emergency Rental Assistance needing continued support so they 
can stay warm and dry this winter.  Without support the burden will 
shift to our local communities already burdened with COVID 
impact and winter needs. There are many more families seeking 
access to these resources both heating assistance and access to 
hotels as they have no place to call their own. 
All Maine households should have access to  basic needs such as a warm, safe, and dry place to 
be in our Maine winter. Please support  LD 3  so we can continue to meet the needs of our most 
vulnerable Mainers this winter.
Thank you for your time, I am happy to answer any questions that I can.
