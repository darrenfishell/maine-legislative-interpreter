LD 3
As a resident of Portland and the state of Maine, I write to strongly urge the passage of LD 3 -
An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High 
Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program.   Thousands of
Mainers face rising heating and energy costs they are unable to manage, as we approach the
official start of winter. Others are on the brink of losing housing, and need the assistance this 
bill will provide until longer term solutions can be found.  At this season which many mark as 
at time of light and hope, let us pass this bill and demonstrate our compassion, and the 
willingness we have as Mainers to take care of one another.
Please pass LD 3.
