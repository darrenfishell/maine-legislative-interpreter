Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs,    
  
My name is Amelia Lyons Rukema, and I am the McKinney -Vento Homeless Education Specialist for 
the Maine Department of Education. I am writing in support o f LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter 
Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program (EMERGENCY) .  Section A -3 which will provide to the Maine 
State Housing Authority funds for use in addressing emergency housing needs occurring between 
December 1, 2022 and April 30, 2023, for those households that were experiencing homelessness or 
housing instability in the State prior to December 1, 2022, will have a direct, positive impact  on 
thousands of Maine students.     
  
The McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act is a federal education law that protects studentsâ€™ rights 
to access their education, no matter what is happening in their home life. It supports students who are 
lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This includes students in substandard 
housing, which may include missing any fundamental utilities, like heat.   
 
Maine has thousands of students (Pre -K through grade 12) sharing housing, couch surfing, stay ing in 
hotels, campgrounds, shelters, or inadequate living situations. These numbers are increasing drastically, 
with some communities seeing 400 -600% increase in identified students from one year to the next. 
Statewide, we have identified over 1 ,500 stude nts as McKinney -Vento. In 2022, 23% of these students 
qualified because of staying in a hotel or motel. 11% of the children identified were truly unsheltered.   
  
Progress in supporting these students is well underway, in part due to the American Rescue Plan -
Homeless Children and Youth funding. The Maine Department of Education has partnered with 
dedicated community -based organizations serving homeless populations t hroughout the State to 
facilitate capacity -building, awareness, and identification in schools. These efforts are building 
community collaboration and connecting students and families with essential services and support 
programs. Additionally, in partnershi p with Gateway Community Services, the Maine Department of 
Education McKinney -Vento Program is coordinating how to better support historically underserved 
populations of multilingual students, students of color, and immigrant students in our State. All wor k 
under the ARP -Homeless Children and Youth funding is reviewed and approved by the Maine Youth 
Action Board, a group of young people who have lived experiences in many systems in our State.

As I have heard directly from parents and school staff, we hav e children in Maine sleeping outdoors, or 
in trailers, and other unheated and unsheltered environments. Their fundamental needs for sleep, 
nutrition, warmth, shelter, medical care, are often going unmet. When these students arrive in the 
classroom, they ar e unable to focus because of their physiological and safety needs. Research has found 
that youth and young adult homelessness is highly correlated with students dropping out of high school. 
Housing insecurity and homelessness is also associated with delays  in meeting developmental 
benchmarks. Together, we must do all we can to ensure the children in our communities will have 
access to their education, regardless of what is happening with their housing situation.     
 
By providing emergency housing assistance  to our most vulnerable families, we can remove a 
significant barrier to students who are experiencing housing insecurity face when accessing their 
education. The funds for short -term emergency housing proposed in this bill will help stabilize housing 
for the families of many students in our schools. Other provisions in LD 3 will provide needed 
assistance to families who are often balancing the demands of paying for rent or paying for heating.     
 
For these reasons the Department of Education supports LD 3 , An Act to Establish the Winter Energy 
Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program (EMERGENCY) . I would be happy to answer any questions the 
Committee may have and will be availa ble for work sessions on this bill.    
 
  
Sincerely,    
  
 
Amelia Lyons Rukema   
McKinney -Vento Homeless Education Specialist
