LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with 
High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program
December 21, 2022
Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot-Ross, and the distinguished members of the Committee 
on Appropriations & Financial Affairs, I appreciate the opportunity for a public hearing on LD 3. 
I talked to multiple seniors going door-to-door that did not receive the $850 checks that the state 
sent out over the summer. They could have benefitted from the assistance but did not realize they 
needed to file an income tax return. These same folks would not receive the proposed $450 
check since it uses 2021 tax returns to determine eligibility. 
I hope the committee can craft an enrollment window to allow those folks, some that need it the 
most, a way to apply for the latest round of relief checks. 
Additionally, I hope the committee can identify and address long-term solutions that would 
improve Maineâ€™s energy costs and our economy. 
Thank you for your consideration.
