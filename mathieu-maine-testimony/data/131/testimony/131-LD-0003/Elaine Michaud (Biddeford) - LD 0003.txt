I am reaching out to you, as a senior citizen and homeowner.  My husband and I are 
both in our 70's and retired.  We both worked full time for our entire lives and were 
fortunate to never ask for any government assistance, even during difficult times.
Never before have we ever felt threatened by or concerned about making ends meet.  
With the ever-rising cost of living, property taxes, food, electricity, heating oil, 
healthcare...
I must admit, we were truly happy and relieved to hear Governor Mills propose the 
emergency heating funding.  The proposed amount ($450) that was voted down would
really make a difference to our getting by without too much pain.  
We truly understand that the lower income can also use extra help but must admit that
this time we feel somewhat slighted.   We are just over the limit to qualify for any 
assistance of any kind, whereas the lower income are able to get assistance for 
housing, medical, dental, optical, food, heating, transportation, internet and so on.  
We, however, have the same needs but must pay our own healthcare, food, heating, 
and so on, as well as pay taxes, both state and federal for the minimal amount or 
retirement we receive.
We truly encourage you to please consider people like us who really, truly need this 
additional help.  Now we are also paying for all the refugees coming from everywhere
through our taxes, which I must admit, we feel slighted and ignored.
Again, please seriously consider supporting Governor Mills original proposal.
Thank You.
