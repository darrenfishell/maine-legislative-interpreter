LD 3
My name is Vivianne Courant and I am here to testify in support of LD 3. While I 
cannot speak to a personal story that relates to why the funding of this bill is a 
necessity, I still urge you to fund it. Housing is a human right, no matter who you are. 
This winter has been freezing, wet, and brutal. I fear for the people in my community 
who must fight to get through it. I have listened to personal stories of how people 
desperately struggle to pay rent, live in their cars, in tents, or otherwise; their 
situations are unacceptable and they deserve far more support than what they have 
right now. People's lives are at stake, and there is so much intervention that can be 
done to mitigate the hardships that come with housing insecurity and homelessness. 
This bill will help to provide that mitigation and safety.
