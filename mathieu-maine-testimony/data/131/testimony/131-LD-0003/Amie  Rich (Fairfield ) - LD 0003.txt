I am against reappropriating HCBS funds. This is the bill that would send out $450 checks to 
most Mainers.
The bill includes a reappropriation of state money from MaineCare. About one-third of that is 
$35 million coming out of Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for Mainers with 
autism or intellectual disability (Section 21/29), brain injury (Section 18), and other related 
conditions (Section
20).
The Administration and Legislative Leadership are saying that this won't impact services 
because it's replaced by federal money.
However, this is perhaps because Section 21/29/18/20 aren't currently fully funded. There are
still massive wait lists and a massive workforce crisis caused by too-low wages for direct 
support professionals.
Instead of taking $35 million out of HCBS, the state should leave that money in HCBS and 
use it to start addressing wait list and work force. This would have a very small effect on the 
payments (keeping about 90% of them).
