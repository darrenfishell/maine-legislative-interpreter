Testimony Regarding LD 3
Good morning Honorable Committee Members. I am Pedro A. Vazquez, current chair of 
the South Portland Human Rights Commission, living on unceded Wabanaki land now 
known as South Portland. I am speaking in favor of LD 3, An Act to Establish the Winter 
Energy Relief Payment Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to 
Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program. I will be brief.
My understanding of the legislative process is that it is meant to provide benefits and 
obligations to all affected citizens.That is the job of this body. The people of this state 
have been ravaged by the effects of this enduring tripledemic. Many are forced to make 
impossible decisions choosing between food, shelter, and heat. You have the means 
and the authority to provide relief to real human beings in these circumstances. You 
also have the moral obligation to do so as fellow human beings. Voting against LD3 or 
operating as an instrument to block it makes you a Grinch, a Scrooge, or even a Hans 
Gruber. And while those are fictional and sometimes amusing characters, think for a 
moment today about the undisputable fact that people will suffer and some will die in 
Maine this winter if you fail to support LD3 or stand in its way. 
Today Iâ€™m here to encourage you to take measures to prevent this unnecessary 
suffering and loss of life by supporting LD3. Look within yourself individually and resolve 
whatever political posturing is preventing you from acting from a place of love for your 
fellow human beings.
As a State that is a leader in seeking a more equitable society, we have an ethical 
obligation to be what we say we are. For the Legislature this is particularly important 
since your policies and decisions affect all of us in Maine. I (we) urge you to support 
LD3.
Thank you.
