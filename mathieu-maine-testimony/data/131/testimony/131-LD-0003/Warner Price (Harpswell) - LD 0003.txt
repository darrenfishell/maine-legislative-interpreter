To Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee
Maine State Legislature
 I am writing in support of the Emergency Winter Energy Relief Bill and its provisions 
proposed by Governor Mills. I believe this bill if enacted would provide immediate financial 
relief for the vast majority of Mainers who are faced with significant hardships in today’s 
inflationary environment.
I was stunned to read that a small group of Senators opposed, and prevented, passage 
of what was a bipartisan effort to distribute surplus funds and federal grant funds for 
heating assistance to alleviate the high heating costs all Mainers currently face. The 
alternative proposal subsequently offered by Republican Senators is an inadequate 
substitution to Governor Mills’ well-designed plan.
Seniors, like my wife and me, living on essentially fixed income budgets, can certainly 
use the one-time boost, and all the low-income Mainers who would have benefited from 
the $50M assistance package can absolutely use the assistance.
To put things in perspective, we have contracted for oil and propane deliveries through 
an annual budget program for over 50 years. In 2021, our monthly payment was $238. In 
2022 the monthly amount increased to $390. This heating season the monthly amount 
has gone up to $709.That calculates to an increase of 198% over our cost in 2021. Our 
Social Security payments and retirement savings have not increased correspondingly.
Thank you for considering these comments.
