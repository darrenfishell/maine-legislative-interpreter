Im speaking on behalf of someone I know and love that could really use the $450 towards 
heating bills. That someone is my elderly mom. She's retired and worked crazy amount of 
hours and shifts to enable my brother and I go to college. 
Luckily she has a place to live because her retirement salary could never afford the rent 
prices we are seeing these days around the southern Maine area in addition to the crunch 
many Mainers are feeling as the price of groceries, clothing, gasoline, and just about 
everything has soared due to inflation.
The cost for a gallon of heating oil in Maine this Fall had hit a record high.
Mainers were paying an average of $5.71 per gallon for number two heating oil and 
$7.07 per gallon of kerosene.
That was the highest price in three decades for home heating fuel in Maine, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration
Most Mainers will need at least 1,000 gallons of oil to get through the winter, based on Fall 
prices that works out to about $5,710 dollars. Thatâ€™s an increase of more than $2550 over 
what the same amount of fuel would have cost with the prices from FALL last year.
Given the recent soaring cost of staying warm this winter, I ask you all to please support and 
advance this emergency energy relief bill and get the  $450 checks out to Maine people to 
help with heating assistance and energy relief as soon as possible . 
Lastly, I would encourage you to direct assistance to the struggling middle and low 
income households. I do not think someone earning $100,000 comes anywhere near 
the scale of the federal poverty level. And more can be given to those with less. 
Thank you!
