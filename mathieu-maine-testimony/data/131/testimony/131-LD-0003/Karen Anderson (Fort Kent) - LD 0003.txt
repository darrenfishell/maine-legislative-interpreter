My husband and I are both public workers and with gas and oil and electricity being 
unbelievably high, even we struggle sometimes to put oil in out tank! So if weâ€™re both
working and have to think twice about how much oil we should buy, imagine the 
elderly or people on disability having to make this same decision.  These utility prices
and FOOD prices are ridiculously and incredibly high. This bill needs to past and then
some!  Thank you for you time listening
