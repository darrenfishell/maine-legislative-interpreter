LD 3
We are deeply deeply concerned about thousands of families including 126 families 
with small children who will be literally out in the cold and homeless with no shelter 
and no options on Dec. 31.  This is just one example of the hardship and suffering for 
our neighbors that will unfold if LD3 does not pass.
