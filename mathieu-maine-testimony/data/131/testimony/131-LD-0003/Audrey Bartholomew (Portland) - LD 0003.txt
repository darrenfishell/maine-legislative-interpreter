Audrey Bartholomew

LD 3
My name is Audrey Bartholomew and I live in Portland. I am presenting testimony against 
deappropriations from Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) in order to partially 
fund LD 3. I have worked in the disability-related field for over 20 years across a variety of 
states and have not seen a crisis such as this one. The waiting lists for HCBS for individuals 
with high support needs are lengthy and the money proposed can be used to alleviate some 
of this wait. I fully support heating aid for Maine families but the small percentage that this 
would cover in that fund would make a significant impact for Maine families with individuals 
with complex needs. While this money will be backfilled by federal funds, itâ€™s important to note
that that still does not address the current crisis of waiting lists. 
We have the opportunity to make improvements in supporting Mainers with the highest 
needs, please do not let them down.
