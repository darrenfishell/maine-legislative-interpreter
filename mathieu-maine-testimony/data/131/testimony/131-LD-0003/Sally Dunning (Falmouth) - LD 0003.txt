LD 3
I am writing to urge passage of bill LD 3 - while many Mainers face difficult circumstances 
which the bill will help alleviate, New Mainers and homeless families face dire circumstances. 
If the bill does not pass, these families, many of whom have endured unimaginable trauma, 
will be subjected to homelessness in frigid temperatures. 
We must act humanely and responsibly, shielding these most vulnerable people from even 
more injustice and cruelty. Please do the right thing and pass this funding bill.  It is not a 
perfect solution, but while that is searched for, protect those who look to us for kindness and 
at the very least help them survive our Maine winter. 
Thank you
