My name is Olivia. I am 18 and have Down syndrome. I am waiting for section 29 
services. When I turned 18, my respite services stopped. These were important to me 
because I got to go places and do things with my BFF (my respite provider). Now, I 
don’t get to see my BFF.
I don’t have section 28 services, I don’t have any workers to take me places except 
one. I do things once a week for two hours with a friend of the family. My mom pays 
for this.
My mom is 62, and I live with her and my dog, Cordelia. My mom just had surgery 
and she can’t walk. I have been trying to take care of her, but it is not easy.
What do I do, as my mom gets older, and she can’t help me anymore?
Why are you taking money away from people like us - expecting us to wait…wait for 
what?
You are just making excuses for taking OUR MONEY and giving it away…Why treat
us like we are invisible and unimportant?
We want FULLY FUNDED section 21 and section 29 services. Don’t make weak 
excuses. 
Respect us - we are here and need the support. 
Fund us - we can’t wait anymore.
