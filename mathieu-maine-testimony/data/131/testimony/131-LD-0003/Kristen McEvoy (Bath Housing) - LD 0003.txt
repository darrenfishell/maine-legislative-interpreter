Bath Housing
LD 3
We staff Comfortably Home, a Bath Housing program that provides safety checks, 
accessibility modifications and minor home repairs for homeowners within a 15-mile 
radius of Bath who have low incomes and are 55+ or any age with a disability.  
During our home visits, we are increasingly encountering homeowners who are 
struggling with not only major home repair needs and some dire, unsafe living 
situations but also access to resources.  Though we do not provide fuel or heating 
assistance, fears about both navigating, and in some cases surviving, this yearâ€™s 
heating season are part of almost every interaction that we have.  We meet 
homeowners who are confident that many older adults will freeze to death in their 
homes this winter, homeowners who have already run out of fuel and have not known
where to turn, homeowners who are panicked about the impossibility of increased fuel
costs on fixed incomes, homeowners who are already receiving heating assistance but 
finding that this year they cannot cover the remainder of the costs and homeowners 
who have never before accessed any kind of public benefits but know that they now 
need to find some kind of support just to make it through this heating season.  
The intersection of cold Maine winters and current energy costs is dangerous.  We consider 
warm, safe housing to be a non-negotiable need of every Maine resident and ask that you 
lend your support to LD3 to provide more Mainers with the opportunity for essential warmth 
and safety.
