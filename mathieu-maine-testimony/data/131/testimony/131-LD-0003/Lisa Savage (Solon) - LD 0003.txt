Thank you for considering the needs of low-income and fixed-income Mainers during
these inflationary times. As a retired teacher I know how families often struggle 
through the cold weather months to keep themselves warm. A first grader told us he 
was sleeping in an unheated camper with his family, but he would soon move schools 
because it was getting too cold. His story is the tip of the iceberg.
Using federal funds to help people with heating costs this winter is a great idea. 
Fussing over means tests for this relief is a waste of time and people are cold right 
now. I urge the Maine legislature to get 'er done.
I notice that my senator was absent when the vote on the previous version of this bill 
was taken. Possibly he was vacationing in a warm place? I hope he will not forget the 
cold little kids among his constituents, and that he will vote in favor this time around.
