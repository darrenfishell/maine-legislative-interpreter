LD 3
As a citizen of Portland, I am deeply concerned about the welfare of  individuals and 
families who are subject to eviction in the dead of winter. We are experiencing a 
housing crisis of extreme proportions. We rely one hundred percent on you, our 
governing body to make decisions with compassion and the welfare of our most 
vulnerable citizens. Please pass LD3 that will be a step towards protecting Mainers 
from the cold and homelessness,
