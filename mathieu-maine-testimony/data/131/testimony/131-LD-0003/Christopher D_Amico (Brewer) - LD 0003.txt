Hey Folks,
We are in the middle of a global pandemic, and in the middle of it's  'Winter of Triple-Demic'.
We have helped so many and needed to help so many more. We had done well and 
we could have done better.
We have the opportunity to now to help Mainers with Winter Heating, even while 
many of us are helping the Ukrainians.  Pandemics and Wars.
I am certainly willing to forego any proposed further pandemic/economic outlays, if 
they can be redirected, dollar for dollar, to this Relief Payment Program, aside from 
any decisions you make about this.
Further, I believe we can find the funds in our taxes to make this happen, regardless.  
We do NOT need to heap pneumonia upon folks contracting all of the circulating 
respiratory illnesses this winter while they are sitting in their freezing cold housing.
Thank you for your time.
