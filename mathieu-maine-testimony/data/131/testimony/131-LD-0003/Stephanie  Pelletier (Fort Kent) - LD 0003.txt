Hi, my name is Stephanie Pelletier, I live in Fort Kent, Maine and I am a self-advocate.  I oppose LD 3 
because itâ€™s not right and they need to find a different fund to take from for the heating assistance. They 
should keep the money for HCBS Maine Care.  I would like to see Waiver services blossom for other 
people and people with waiver services need to feel confident that they are respected.  Thank You for 
listening.
Thank You,
Stephanie Pelletier
