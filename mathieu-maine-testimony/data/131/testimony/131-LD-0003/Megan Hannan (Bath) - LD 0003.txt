207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 3:  
An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment Program to 
Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID 
Pandemic Relief Payment Program  
December  21, 2022 
 
 
Senator Jackson, Representative Talbot Ross, ladi es and gentlemen of 
the Committee On Appropriations and Financial Affairs , I am Megan 
Hannan, Exec utive Director of Maine Community Action Partnership, the 
association of the ten community action agencies in Maine and we 
support LD 3 "An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment 
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the 
COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program .” 
 
As we all know, heating fuel prices are at an all  time high this y ear, and 
although ou r shar e of the  federally  funded Low Income Home Energy  
Assistance Program  (LIHEAP, or HEAP) is a little above least year ’s 
funding, the higher price of fuel means we can either  serve  fewer people 
with the same benefit as l ast year, or the same number of households will 
receive a lower benefit. My organization has been lucky to receive donations for supporting families who are struggling with  heating costs, 
but the demand far outweighs the supply.  
 Putting $50,000,000 in the hands of community action agencies, who are 
the local administrators of HEAP fund s, means that many more 
households will be safe and warm this winter. Of that sum, $10 million will 
be accessed by those who are not eligible  for HEAP funds, either by 
being just over the income lim its or having already used their  HEAP 
benefit. We will make sure that those funds are low barrier to access and 
not subject to the lengthy process Federal HEAP fund s require. The other 
$40 million, of course, will be accessible through the regular HEAP 
process to assure proper distribution. 
 
This bill also addresses our current housing crisis. The $21,000,000 
allocated in this bill will allow our  emergency rental assistance program to 
finish payments to eligible households for the winter, averting a potential 
crisis of homeless families in the dead of our coldest season . We know 
we need a medium - and long-term  solution to this problem and that this 
only buys us some ti me to address th ose pressing needs  and we are 
working on that; in the meantime, we do need this bridge to assure 
families are safe during the winter.  
 
Finally, this bill also puts money directly in the pockets of those who need 
it most. We know the simple solution to being able to eat, heat and pay bills is having money with  which to do so, and this  second r ound of relief 
goes a long way to doing that. 
 
Thank you for your time and attention today. I am happy to answer any 
questions you have.
