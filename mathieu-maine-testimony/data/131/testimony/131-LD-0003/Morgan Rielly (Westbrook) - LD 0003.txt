 To the Committee of Appropriations & Financial Af fairs:  
 Earlier this month, on December 7th, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents came  
 together in the House of Representatives to vote overwhelmingly to enact LD 1 with a 125-16  
 vote. LD 1 should have been signed into law earlier this month, but failed in the Senate.  I am  
 writing to you to now strongly support the passage of LD 3. This crucial piece of legislation will  
 help Mainers in need during the winter months to heat their homes and needs immediate action.  
 A failure to pass this legislation will have a devastating and even deadly consequences for  
 Mainers across the state. Inadequate funding of housing and shelters will result in people across  
 the state experiencing homelessness. No one should have to experience homelessness, especially  
 during Maineâ€™ s winter . 
 We have heard for months from our constituents that they are afraid for themselves, for  
 their family members, and for their neighbors about being unable to af ford to heat their homes  
 this winter . Immediate action is essential. I ur ge for quick passage of this legislation and further  
 legislation to address long-term issues regarding housing and af fordability of heating to be made  
 a priority during the 131st Legislature.
