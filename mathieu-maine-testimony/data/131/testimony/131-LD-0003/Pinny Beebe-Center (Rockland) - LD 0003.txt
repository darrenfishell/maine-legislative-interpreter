Testimony in support of LD 3 “An Act to Establish the Winter Energy Relief Payment
Program to Aid Residents with High Heating Costs and to Finalize the COVID Pandemic Relief 
Payment Program”
President Jackson, Speaker Talbot Ross, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs, my name is Pinny Beebe-Center and I 
proudly represent the people of Senate District 12, which includes the towns of Appleton, 
Camden, Criehaven UT, Cushing, Friendship, Hope, Matinicus Isle Plantation, Muscle Ridge 
Islands 156 UT, North Haven, Owls Head; Rockland, Rockport; Saint George, South Thomaston, 
Thomaston, Union, Vinalhaven, and Warren.
I am here today to testify in support LD 3, an emergency measure that provides 
direct heating and housing relief to Mainers. I have had countless conversations with my 
constituents regarding the issues that this bill aims to address: high heating costs, emergency 
rental relief and sending out the last of the COVID relief checks. The amount of people who are 
at risk of eviction or are wondering how they are going to keep their family warm this winter, is 
absolutely heartbreaking. I believe we have a duty to assist those who have trusted us to 
represent them. Doing anything less would be a disservice to the good people of Maine.
It is time for us to help our fellow Mainers, and give some much needed relief as temperatures 
drop. I urge you all to pass LD 3, so that we can begin to address what will become a much 
larger issue moving forward.
