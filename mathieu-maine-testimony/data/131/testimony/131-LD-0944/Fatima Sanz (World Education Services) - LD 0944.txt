World Education Services Statement of Support for LD 944  
World Education Services (WES) supports Maine’s LD 944, which would extend residency -based in -
state tuition rates to eligible refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers who enroll in the University of 
Maine System, the Maine Community College System , and the Maine Maritime Academy.  
WES is a non -profit social enterprise dedicated to helping international students, immigrants, and 
refugees achieve their educational and career goals in th e U.S. and Canada. For more than 45 
years, WES has set the standard of excellence in the field of international academic credential 
evaluation. Through WES Global Talent Bridge, the organization joins with institutional partners, 
community -based organizati ons, and policymakers to help immigrants and refugees who hold 
international credentials fully utilize their talents and education to achieve their academic and 
professional goals. Through its grantmaking, impact investing, and partnerships, the WES Mariam  
Assefa Fund seeks to advance economic and social inclusion for immigrants and refugees.   
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that only 6  percent  of 
refugees globally are enrolled in higher education institutions,1 compared to a n average of 40  
percent  participation in tertiary education.2 According to the UNHCR, cos t—along  with language 
barriers and secondary credential recognition —is one of the top barriers to access to higher 
education for refugees  worldwide .3  
According to a report published by the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the Maine 
Development Foundation, and Educate Maine, there are approximately 87,000 immigrants,  
refugees , and asylum seekers in Maine.4 Exte nding in -state tuition benefits to these populations 
will increase access to higher education opportunities bolstering the economic vitality of local 
communities.

Last year, Maine offered free community college to students graduating high school from 202 0 to 
2023 .5 This temporary initiative led to an  11 percent  increase in  community college  summer 
applications compared to the previous year.6  
Given the success of similar efforts in the state, LD 944 is an example of evidence -based policy 
making. Extending in -state tuition rates to eligible refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers  is an 
investment in Maine’s future workforce and the state’s economic and social vitality . 
One improvement WES  recommend s for LD 944 is to include Temporary Protected Status  (TPS)  
holders as another category of displaced students eligible for in -state tui tion. This  could benefit 
people from Afghanistan and Ukraine who may not otherwise be included .  
Additionally,  other categories of non -citizens could be eligible for in -state tuition (see for example 
Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 3, 102 S.Ct. 2977, 73 L.Ed.2 d 563 , 1982 ). LD 944 should be modified to  
clarify  that it does not preclude other non -citizen categories who qualify for in -state tuition based 
on other eligibility grounds.  
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement of support.
