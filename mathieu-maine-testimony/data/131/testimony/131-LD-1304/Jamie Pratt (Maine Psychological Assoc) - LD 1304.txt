Re:  LD 1304 Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Barriers to Achieving  
Behavioral Health Integration and Parity  
 
Dear Representative Perry and  Senator Bailey, and Representatives Brennan, Dhalac, and Madigan:   
 
The Maine Psychological Associa�on (MePA ) is a membership organiza�on represen�ng psychologists in 
Maine who work in private prac�ce, at Maine’s colleges and universi�es, and in the public sector. Our 
mission is to advance psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promo�ng  health and 
human welfare.   
 
MePA  is in s upport of this critical emergency legislation  to establish a task for ce to study  service barriers 
to behavioral health treatment  in Maine. At a time when there is a serious shortage of mental health 
providers across the state, on the heels of a national pandemic, we have an  unprecedented shortage of 
BH services for every sector of the population, from school children to the elderly.  
 
Today,  an appointment  with a BH provider is five times more likely to be out -of-network than a primary 
care appointment , causing patients to travel long distances, pay high costs, wait long periods , or forgo  
critical treatment.  Coupled with special insurance req uirements placed on BH providers, including extra 
authorizations and credentialling, the roadblocks are  compounded.  
 We are asking for your support to develop this task force to identify the barriers that private and public 
insurance  providers place  on BH treatment services . Only by understanding these roadblocks in our 
insurance system can we  improve access , encourage i ntegration with primary care,  and streamline our 
state’s ability to provide BH treatment to people of all ages.  
 Respectfully submitted,  
 
Jamie Pratt , PsyD
