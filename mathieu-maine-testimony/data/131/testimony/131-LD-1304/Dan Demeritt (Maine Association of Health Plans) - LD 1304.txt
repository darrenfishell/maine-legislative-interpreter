Testimony of Dan Demeritt  – April 11, 2023  
 Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
Neither For Nor Against  LD 1304  
Resolve , to Establish the Task Force to Study Barriers to Achieving Behavioral Health Integration and Parity  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance, and Financial Services:  
  
My name is Dan Demeritt. I am the Executive Director of the Maine Associat ion of Health Plans (MeAHP). 
Our member plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, Community Health 
Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and UnitedHealthcare . Our private and non -profit plans  provide or 
administer health insuranc e coverage to about 600,000  Maine people . Our mission as an association is to 
improve the health of Maine people by promoting affordable, safe, and coordinated healthcare.  
___________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Healthcare and health insurance  in Maine  are highly regulated industries  working to deliver the best possible 
care while  confronting growing workforce and cost pressures . The Board of the Maine Association of Health 
Plans appreciates the sponsor bringing this bill for ward in the spirit of improved access to appropriate and 
effective  behavioral health treatment.  
 
We are concerned, however, that the language  directing the task force to study barriers  “imposed by insurers 
and experienced by provi ders” unfairly characterizes the  intent of payors and too narrowly limits the scope of 
the review.  
 
A better and fairer purpose would be a n amended  directive to “study barriers among patients in accessing 
appro priate behavioral  health services .”  
 
In addition to that language change, we suggest the committee include a directive that the  task force 
membership include s a representative of a Maine insurance carrier  knowledgeable about or involved in 
providing insurance coverage for behavioral health tr eatment .  
 
Finally, more than half of all Mainers receiv e health coverage through public payors – about 400,000  Mainers 
are enrolled in MaineCare1 and another 360,00 0 receive Medicare.2 An examination of barriers to behavioral 
health integration and parity should also include public programs within its scope.  
 
Thank you . We look forward to being a resource as the committee works on  this bill.
