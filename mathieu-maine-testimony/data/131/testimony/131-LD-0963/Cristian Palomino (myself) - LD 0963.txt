As a citizen of the United States of America I have experienced the harassment, 
retaliation, and discrimination from your local government. It is my right to finally be 
able to share my story and talk about how the problems in your local government 
affect us all. Until last week I have still been illegally surveilled so I will show myself
to you all.
