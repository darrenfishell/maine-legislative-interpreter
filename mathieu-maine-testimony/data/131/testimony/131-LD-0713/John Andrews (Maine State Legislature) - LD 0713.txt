Testimony in Support of LD 713 
“RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Dedicate a 
Portion of Sales and Use Taxes from All Motor Vehicle Sales and Motor Vehicle-related 
Sales to the Highway Fund for Road and Bridge Capital lmprovements ” 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, my name is John Andrews and l represent House District 79 in 
the foothills of western Maine. l am here today to present my Resolution LD 713, 
“RESOLUTlON, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Dedicate a Portion of 
Sales and Use Taxes from All Motor Vehicle Sales and Motor Vehicle-related Sales to the 
Highway Fund for Road and Bridge Capital Improvements ”. 
This resolution proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to dedicate 50% of sales and use 
tax revenue from sales of motor vehicles and sales related to motor vehicles to the Highway 
Fund for road and bridge capital improvements. lt only makes sense that we use a vehicle tax 
that has been in place forever, to help benefit the roads that our vehicles drive on. 
We are always struggling to find money to do infrastructure projects on roads and bridges and 
this is a great opportunity to add money to the Highway Fund to help fund these projects that we 
desperately need. 
l urge you to vote ought to pass on this Resolution, as l think it would be helpful to the struggles 
we are having in regards to infrastructure projects. 
Thank you for your time and commitment to public service, 
John Andrews
