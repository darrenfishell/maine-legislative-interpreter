Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
This bill is the reason our forefathers included wording about unreasonable searches 
in the constitution.
What goes on in my house is no one's business but the people who live in my house.
This is nothing but government intervention, intrusion and a power move.
I thought I was disgusted to the limit with other bills offered to this committee, but 
this one takes the cake.
Excuse me as I shove another log into the fireplace and get my gas stove to burning 
ready to cook supper.
