An Act to Support Lower Home Energy Costs by Establishing a Home Energy Scoring System  
March 30, 2023  
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler , and Honorable Members of the  Energy, Utilities, and 
Technology ; 
On behalf of the American Institute for Architects, Maine Chapter (AIA Maine), I am pleased to 
submit this testimony in support of LD  1101 , An Act to Support Lower Home Energy Costs by 
Establishing a Home Energy Scoring System . 
 
AIA Maine supports LD 1101 because it would  help inform both buyers and sellers about the 
value of their home with respect to home efficiency. For those who want it, this will mean a 
useful tool to market both homes and the kind of clean and efficient energy systems that we 
need to address climate change. This legislation meets a consumer demand while moving the 
needle on public awareness regarding home energy efficiency.  
 
Maineâ€™s building stock is the oldest in the country, and with rising en ergy prices and more 
dramatic changes in weather, we have a heightened need to provide Mainers with a reliable and 
science -based standard for scoring home energy efficient through an auditing system  for 
residential homes.  
 
AIA Maine applauds PassivhausMAIN E for its efforts in bringing forward this legislation, and for 
GrowSmart Maine and BuildMaine for helping advance the bill as part of Policy Action 2023. We 
welcome the opportunity to support a well -crafted, voluntary program that looks toward the 
current  and future needs of Maine residents in managing their energy consumption at home.  
 
We encourage the EUT Committee to pass LD 1101 with an Ought to Pass report.  
 
Sincerely,  
Elizabeth M. Frazier
