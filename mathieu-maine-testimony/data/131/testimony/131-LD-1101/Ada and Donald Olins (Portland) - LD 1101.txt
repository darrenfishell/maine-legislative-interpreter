LD 1101
We support LD1101.  As long-time residents of Portland, ME we want to take every 
opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint and save our planet.  
We live in a large apartment house/condo.  When we remodeled our unit we also 
insulated our external walls.  Very few others in our building have done this.  We 
have a warmer apartment than most of our neighbors but have not received any 
financial benefits since heating costs are shared on a “per square foot” basis.  Resale 
values are difficult to estimate without a measurement of the value of our insulation.
Please join us in supporting LD1101.
