Maine Indoo r Air Quality Council Testimony  in Support of LD 1101: An Act to Support Lower Home 
Energy Costs by Establishing a Home Energy Scoring System  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council (“MIAQC” or the “Council” ) is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization  
dedicated to creating healthy, productive and environmentally sustainable  indoor environments in 
Maine.  Our efforts focus on the development of education , communications, and  advocacy for safe and 
healthy indoor environments where Maine citizens live, work, play and learn.  
 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Energy, Utilities and Technology:  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quali ty Council supports Maine’s efforts to reduce energy use in our buildings.  
However, we know that e nergy conservation efforts may compromise both the quality of an indoor 
envi ronment  as well as the building structure, increasing  the risk of adverse occupant health  effects .  
We support LD 1101, but are concerned that as currently drafted it inadequately addresses  the need to 
assess ventilation , radon, and moisture  as part of any energy auditing process or assignment of a home 
energy “score.”   (Note:  A copy of  our full Policy Statement on Energy Efficiency and Indoor Air Quality 
is attached at the end of this testimony for your review.)  
 
Recommended Amendment  
 
The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council recommends  the following  be included in the required list of 
items to be contained in the proposed energy audit report (shown in Item 4, section B (2) of the bill ): 
 
 A list of current mechanical ventilation  in the home , specifically :  a. No me chanic al ventilation b. 
exhaust -only ventilation (kitchen fan vented outdoors) c. exhaust only ventilation (bath fan vented 
outdoors); d: recovery ventilation (ERV or HRV).   Recommendations for ensuring minimum 
acceptable ventilation  per ASHRAE 62.2 should be included in the list of prioritized actions for 
improvement.  
 
 Radon status:  a .) Has the home been t ested for radon in air  and wha t the test result  was, and b. 
whe ther a radon system is currently installed in the home .  Recommenda tions for ensuring energy 
upgrades don’t negatively impact radon levels should be included in the list of prioritized actions 
for improvement.  
 
 Evidence of moisture problems, such as bas ement or roof leaks or chronic high relative humidity .  
Recom mendations for repairing leaks and reducing humidity should be included in the list of 
prioritized actions for improvement.

MIAQC Policy Statement on Energy Efficiency and Indoor Air Quality  
Adopted by MIAQC Board of Directors in 2003, Revised in 2009 and 2017.  
 
 The Maine Indoor Air Quality Council supports efforts to increase energy efficiency in the 
operation and maintenance of buildings.  
 
 Energy efficiency and indoor air quality are not mutually exclusive goals. You can have both.  
 
 Energy conservation efforts can compromise both the quality of indoor environments as well as 
the mechanical systems and building structure, leading to the ris k of adverse health effects and 
reduced productivity.  
 
 Energy efficiency efforts must take the following into consideration:  
 Pre-project evaluation of the building for conditions that could negatively impact indoor 
air quality, specifically moisture, radon, and ventilation  
 Sufficient ventilation for fresh air and dilution of pollutants to maintain health and 
safety of occupants  
 Moisture control to prevent water intrusion or excessive humidity  
 Technical ability of energy contractors to address both indo or air quality and energy 
efficiency  
 Technical ability of building operators to maintain the systems  
 
 A proper balance between energy efficiency and indoor air quality can be achieved if designers, 
contractors, building owners and facility managers make we ll-reasoned decisions based on 
existing best practice guidance, specifically ASHRAE 90.1 (Energy Standard for Buildings) and 
ASHRAE 62.1 (Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality) And ASHRAE 62.2 (Ventilation for 
Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low -Rise Residential Buildings)
