Testimony of Senator Eric Brakey 
L.D. 725, An Act to Add an Adult Education Pathway to a High School Diploma 
Before the Maine LegisIature ’s Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
Wednesday, March 29, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, I am Senator Eric Brakey, representing 
the people of Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland, and Durham. Today, I am here to 
present L.D. 725, “An Act to Add an Adult Education Pathway to a High School 
Dip|oma. ” 
The traditional education track is not always the best for every student. Fortunately, in 
recent years, more options have become available for students allowing them to 
complete their education. For any number of reasons, Adult Education classes can 
sometimes be a better fit for some students. 
This legislation provides that a high school student who has opted to take Adult 
Education courses and completes the courses required by the Commissioner of 
Education in four years would be eligible to receive a high school equivalent diploma. 
While not on the traditional track, students enrolled in Adult Education courses 
are dedicated to completing their studies. 
In addition to supporting this legislation, I am asking that a provision be added that 
would count these diplomas toward the school districts rate of completion. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I will gladly take questions.
