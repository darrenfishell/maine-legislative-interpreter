Melissa McLeod 
Principal, Franklin Alternative School 
Auburn School Department 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the proposed legislation 
that would create an adult education diploma pathway for Maine students. My name is 
Melissa McLeod and l am the principal of the Franklin Alternative School in Auburn, 
Maine. The Franklin School serves the educational needs of students in grades 7-12 
who are at-risk of not graduating and has been in operation since 1978. l have been an 
alternative educator for 14 years. l am grateful for the opportunity to share some of my 
experience of working collaboratively with adult education to meet the diverse needs of 
my students. l’m here today to implore this committee to recognize the combined 
efforts of our students and school districts to make a high school diploma attainable for 
all. 
As educators, we must always seek ways to meet the evolving needs of our students 
and communities. The traditional route to a high school diploma is the most familiar but 
it is not appropriate or accessible to all students. Increasingly, a significant number of 
high school aged students are being challenged to take on the role of supporting 
themselves and their families. Often these adult responsibilities can interfere with 
accessing the traditional high school model. For a number of Maine teenagers, the 
choice to stay in a traditional day school directly impacts their ability to support 
themselves. We are likely to lose these students due to drop out if we cannot provide 
another valid pathway that meets their needs. 
Recently, l had a young woman who was in her senior year and was employed through 
our work-study program at a local nursing home. Her home life was difficult, she did not 
receive the support she needed and the environment was often abusive and 
demoralizing. She was given the opportunity to take advantage of an on-the-job training 
program that would provide her with her CNA credential that would open the door to

additional training and promotion. This certification was a lifeline for her to gather the 
resources she needed to be independent and self-sufficient. Despite our best efforts, 
the only feasible way for this student to access this program was for her to drop-out of 
day school and transition to our adult education program to earn her diploma. For the 
final semester of what would have been her senior year of high school, this student was 
in CNA training from 7:00am to 4:30pm and then attended adult education classes from 
5:30 - 8:30pm four days a week. She earned both her CNA credential and a 20 credit 
adult education diploma by June of what would have been her senior year. Despite her 
incredible dedication to bettering herself professionally and academically, she is still 
considered a drop out for the Auburn School Department. 
Adult education diploma students often represent some of the most hard-working, 
resilient and determined young people in our district. in my experience, students who 
make the difficult decision to leave a traditional day school model and enroll in an adult 
education program, are facing challenges that most of us never dreamed of facing at 
their age. These students are often trying to break the cycle of generational poverty, 
substance misuse, unstable housing, teen parenting, and a multitude of other complex 
situations. These students don’t want to give up on school, they want better for 
themselves and their families. They want and need a pathway to graduate on time that 
works for them. This option exists through adult education programs and these students 
should be recognized as on-time completers. 
Choice is the central message l give my students when talking about a high school 
diploma. Every achievement, diploma, training, course, etc opens another door- 
provides another option. Our students need every option we can provide to attain a high 
school diploma and grow to become the citizens that the state of Maine needs to thrive. 
Now you have the choice - this proposed legislation is the right choice for recognizing 
the efforts of school districts and students to utilize an adult education pathway fora 
diploma without being considered a dropout.
