In Opposition To  
LD 750, An Act t o Eliminate the Limits on Candidates’ Speech at the Polls  
 
March 8, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 750 
on behalf of Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, t he LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Until the early 1900s, the polls looked very different than they do today where lines of 
constituents are quietly lined up waiting for their turn to cast their vote in a curtain- lined booth. 
Early elections were contentious with voters on either side of the ballot often turning to violence 
to gain votes. In factory towns, managers would often stand at the door to be sure those in attendance voted “the right way.”  
At this point in time, states began passing laws to protect voters from being harassed or 
intimidated into voting a certain way , and w ith the development of social media platforms, voters 
are bombarded with information about candi dates leading up to the elections and, generally 
speaking, have already decided who they will be cast ing their vote for.  
There have been several bills presented this session to address election fraud and prevent 
harassment at the polls, yet it seems that LD 750 would reverse those efforts by essentially removing the sanctity of the polls.  
For these reasons, the LPC is opposed to LD 750. Thank you for  your time and for  
considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
