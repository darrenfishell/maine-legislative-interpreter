Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 10, 2023   Senator Anne Carney, Chair Representative Matt Moonen, Chair Committee on Judiciary 100 State House Station, Room 438 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 585: An Act To Allow Equitable Tolling of Post-conviction Review Filings   Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Committee on Judiciary:  MACDL submits this testimony in support of LD 585: An Act To Allow Equitable Tolling of Post-conviction Review Filings.  “Equitable” means what is fair, what is just. To prevent the deficiencies of another from preventing a convicted person to pursue justice—that is what is at stake with this proposed legislation. For people who sit in our prisons, languishing due to the oversights or negligence of counsel or the nefariousness of people as-yet unknown, the time always must be right to do what is right.  Whenever there is an effort to amend the laws around time limits of post-conviction review, prosecutor inevitably decry that doing so would undercut “finality” for victims of crime and would open the floodgates to PCR petitions. Let me address both of these contentions in turn.  First, the paramount consideration here must be justice, not finality. If an innocent person or an aggrieved person has been deprived an opportunity—due to no fault of their own—to pursue a claim on post-conviction review, that opportunity must be afforded to them. Finality means nothing if a wrongful conviction is the result.  Second, the very language of this bill should eliminate any concerns around “floodgate” openings. The limitations of the bill are spelled out in the text: “extraordinary circumstances” and “good cause shown.” This is not mere verbiage. These terms have meanings in the law. Extraordinary circumstances, in common usage, means circumstances beyond one’s own control, i.e. deficiencies of counsel. “Good cause shown” has a similar meaning: a compelling reason, beyond the ordinary “oversight” or “busy-ness” excuses, for the lateness of a filing.  As a practical matter, the men and women who would comprise the potential “late filers” represent an extremely small number of Maine’s incarcerated population—most likely those convicted of the most serious crimes with the harshest of penalties.  I currently represent one of those men. Due to his attorney’s ignoring of his pleas to file a timely petition for post-conviction review based on newly discovered evidence in 2017, upon a motion by the State of Maine, the PCR court dismissed the petition as untimely—which dismissal the Law Court upheld without argument in 2020. Under a new theory, we have preserved this PCR for the client—but his claims that were dismissed back in 2019 may still be procedurally defaulted at the end of the day. We do not know what will 
happen to those claims because there is no law precisely on point that would protect a client from the lack of diligence by counsel.  You may hear a prosecutor or two argue before you today that this legislation is unnecessary, that judges “know how to do the right thing.” Unfortunately, for my client and for any client, we cannot merely depend on the beneficence of judges. We need to have the legislature craft a law upon which judges can hang their equitable hats. Maine needs to say, explicitly, that clients will no longer pay for the mistakes of their counsel when filing a “late” petition for PCR. That due process and basic principles of fairness require more than “Ooops! You are out of time! Sorry about that!” for PCR petitioners.  If we care about truth, if we care about justice, if we care about fairness: we will pass this bill.  Thank you for your consideration and your attention to this matter. I will make myself available for any Committee questions at the as-yet to-be-scheduled work session, as this is an important bill that requires close attention and swift action.                     Sincerely,        /s/ Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                                MACDL Executive Director
