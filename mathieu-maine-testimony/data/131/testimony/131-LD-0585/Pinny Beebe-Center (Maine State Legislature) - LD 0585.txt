Testimony of Senator Pinny Beebe-Center introducing LD 585 “An Act to Allow Equitable Tolling of 
Post-Conviction Review Filings” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
April 10, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Distinguished Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary. I am Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, and I represent all of Knox County, 
except for Isle Au Haut and the town of Washington. I am here to introduce LD 585, “An Act to Allow 
Equitable Tolling of Post-Conviction Review Filings. ” 
The purpose of this legislation is to allow equitable tolling to assist petitioners seeking to ﬁle a post- 
conviction review if there were unable to file before the limitations have expired due to extraordinary 
circumstances. Equitable tolling is a principle that allows a petition to be ﬁled after a period of set 
limitations if the petitioner proves that the petitioner pursued the petitioner ’s rights diligently and with 
reasonable care, but failed to meet he limitations due to extraordinary circumstances. This is often used to 
prevent those who have done wrong from continuing got beneﬁt from their wrongdoing, and is often 
raised by a plaintiff in response to a statute of limitations request. 
I thank you for your time and consideration. I invite you to direct your questions to Tina Nadeau of the
