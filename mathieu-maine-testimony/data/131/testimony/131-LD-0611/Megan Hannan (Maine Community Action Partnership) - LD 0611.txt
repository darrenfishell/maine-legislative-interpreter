207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 611 An Act to 
Create the Whole Home Repairs Program 
April’ 2a, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Special Committee 
on Housing, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership, the membership organization of the ten 
Community Action Agencies in Maine, and we support the Sponsor’s 
Amendment to LD 611 An Act to Create the Whole Home Repairs 
Program.V
t 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people's possibilities. In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a family's capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the family's well-being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success. 
To that end, among other programs and services, we administer 
MaineHousing weatherization programs to help keep Maine residents 
“Warm and Dry,” as we call the program. This bill addresses one of the 
frustrations we have had over time: when we come to a house that 
needs extensive repairs, we do not have the funding mechanism to do 
that, so we have to leave it behind rather than do the general 
weatherization work, for which we do have funds. It has been a pen/erse 
disincentive to the work. 
My agencies ’ crews do this work through multiple channels, but none 
have had the ability to really fix the big problem first. To have access to 
this complimentary program, do fix the roof and windows before we 
weatherproof them, for example, makes so much sense. It will allow us 
to serve customers we have not been able to serve before, which is, as 
you know, especially important now, when we need to help keep people 
safe in their homes for as long as possible, due to the lack of housing for 
anyone to move to. . 
l have not seen the ﬁscal note, but l would ask that if you choose to pass 
this bill, you really fund it, as well. The need is there, and like 
MaineHousing has been saying about a predictable, sustained funding 
source for building homes, that predictability and sustained funding is 
equally true here. 
Thank you very much for your time and attention, I am happy to answer 
your questions if l can.
