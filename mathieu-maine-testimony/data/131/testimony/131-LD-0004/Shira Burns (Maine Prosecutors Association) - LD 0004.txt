LD 4 
“An Act to Update Provisions of the Department of Corrections La w Regarding Operation and 
Administration of Jails, Women’s Services and Juvenile Detention ”  
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
 
Public Hearing Date: February 1 3, 2023  
Testimony in Support of  LD 4  
 
Senator Beebe -Center, Representative Salisbury  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety . My name is Shira Burns and I represent th e Maine Prosecutors 
Association. I am here to testify in support of LD 4 in regard to section 5, Setof f of victim 
restitution against lottery winnings, and provide some clarifying language.  
 
Section 5 allows another way for the Department of Corrections to collect court ordered restitution 
for crime victims. This bill only affect s restitution paid through  the Department of Corrections. A 
bill will be coming before you this session that will address this same issue, but pertains to 
restitution pai d through the District Attorney’s Office  and Office of the Attorney General.  
 
The language used in section 5 sa ys “restitution payable through the department and imposed by a 
court under  Title 17 -A.” This could lead to confusion if this statute is meant to limit its applicability 
to 17 -A crimes or applies more broadly to any court ordered restitution. Since restitu tion can be part 
of a disposition in many non 17 -A crimes, the  Maine Prosecutors Association  recommend s to 
change the langue to “restitution payable through the department and imposed by a court subject to 
the provisions of  Title 17 -A, Part 6.”  
 
 Thanks for your time and I am available for any questions you may have.
