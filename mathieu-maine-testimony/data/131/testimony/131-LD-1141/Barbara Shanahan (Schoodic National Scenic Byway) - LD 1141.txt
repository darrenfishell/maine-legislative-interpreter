Dear Transportation Committee,
     On behalf of the Schoodic National Scenic Byway Committee, we strongly oppose the removal of one million dollars from the Maine Tourism Marketing and Promotion Funds.  Those funds support the Schoodic Region communities and businesses.  One of the byway’s highest priorities is to increase economic growth by bringing tourism to our area.  We have partner with DART and Maine Oﬃce of Tourism to increase awareness of our beautiful region. We have worked over 25 years to promote both Hancock and Washington counties as tourism destinations.  Our dedicated committee is made up of volunteers with limited funding.  Maine Tourism Marketing funds are essential to continuing this work.      
     The committee appreciates MaineDOT for all their assistance on byway projects.  The marketing of the Schoodic Region has help to relieve some tourism stress and impacts on the Bar Harbor Region, helping Maine be a better place to live and visit.  It is also a priority of the Schoodic Byway to promote safe biking along the roadside.  We have found it can be achieved working with MaineDOT and their existing programs and hope others will do the same.  We believe the gains made in marketing and promoting this region is a win, win! 
Pease vote against the bill, LD 1141. 
Sincerely, 
Barbara Shanahan,  Chairperson 
Schoodic National Scenic Byway
