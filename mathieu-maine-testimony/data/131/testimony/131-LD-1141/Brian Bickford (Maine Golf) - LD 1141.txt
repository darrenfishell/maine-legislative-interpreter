Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation:
I am vehemently opposed to robbing the Tourism Marketing Fund to pay for paving 
bike paths.  Funding capital projects from operating budgets is not good practice and 
each capital investment should be measured against other capital projects rather than 
operating expenses. Additionally, robbing the Marketing Fund of $1 million in 
expense has a net revenue impact of millions of dollars.  Why would I say something 
like this?  Because every dollar spent on tourism marketing has a return of 3x (est.) 
and a net impact of sales tax revenue.  Thus, while it sounds like a simple transfer of 
monies is simply $1 million, the net impact is far greater, not only on the Marketing 
Fund, but on State of Maine revenue.   
In short, if paving bike paths are so important, monies should be allocated from a 
capital account for paving roads rather than expense account with a return on 
investment negatively impacting the State of Maine. 
Sincerely, 
Brian Bickford
