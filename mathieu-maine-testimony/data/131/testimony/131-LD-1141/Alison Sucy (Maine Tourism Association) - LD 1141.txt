_ on State Roadways Leading to State Parks and Other Significant Destinations -A

Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation: AA 
'A 
My name is Alison Sucy and I am the Chief Operating Officer and Director of Government 
Affairs for the Maine Tourism Association. The Maine Tourism Association is a non-proﬁt 
associationand the state’s largest tourism organization. For over 100 years, MTA has been 
promoting Maine and supporting members in every type of tourism business such as lodging, 
restaurants, campgrounds, retail, outdoor recreation, guides, tour operators, amusements, and 
historical and cultural attractions. I am testifying in opposition to LD 1141 as drafted.' 
We have no objections to the goal of this bill to add wide shoulders and bike lanes on state 
highways leading to state parks. We have a strong objection to sweeping $1 million per year 
out of the Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund for paving projects." 
The Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund has a decades-long history and the purpose behind its 
creation was to ensure not only the strength of the tourism industry in Maine but to ensure the 
economic strength of the State of Maine. Tourism is a tremendous contributor to the Maine 
economy as evidenced by the attached sheet from the Maine Ofﬁce of Tourism (MOT), . 
Department of Economic and Community Development. This 2022 data was released at the 
Governor ’s Conference of Tourism on March 28, 2023. Some of those highlights are: 
0 Tourism supported 151,000 Maine jobs 
0 Every 102 visitors support a new job in Maine 
Q Direct tourism expenditures totaled $8.6 billionl 
I Without“ 
tourism, Maine households , would have had to pay an additional $2,172 infstate 
and local taxes ~‘ 
The Maine Tourism Association is the state’s largest advocate for all tourism-related businesses. Incorporated in 1922, MTA 
members include lodging, restaurants, camps, c_ampgrounds,.retail, outdoor recreation, guides, tour operators, transportation, 
amusements, and cultural and historical attractions. MTA also operates on behalf of the state seven State Visitor Infonnation Centers 
from Kitteiy to Calais, and annually produces the state’s ofﬁcial travel planner, Maine Invites You (since 193-3).
In 2001, the Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund was created. The Title 36 section is 
referencing the meals and lodging taxes. 
5 MRS §13090-K. Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund 
1. Fund established. The Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund is established in the 
Department of Economic and Community Development, Ofﬁce of Tourism asa 
nonlapsing dedicated account. 
2. Source of fund. Beginning July 1, 2003 and every July lst thereafter, the State 
Controller shall transfer to the Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund an amount, as 
certified by the State Tax Assessor, that is equivalent to. . .5% of the 8% tax and 5% of 
the 9% tax imposed on tangible personal property and taxable services pursuant to Title 
36, section 1811.' 
Of all the revenue generated by the meals and lodging taxes, 95% stays in the General Fund 
while 5% is deposited into the dedicated Tourism Marketing Promotion Fund to be used to 
promote Maine as a destination for visitors. This, in turn, brings visitors to Maine and 
generates all of the job and revenue beneﬁts listed above and on the attached MOT Highlights 
sheet.- 
The reason that this dedicated fund is so important is that we know from other states what 
happens when you reduce or eliminate state tourism marketing investments. It is clear that 
states cannot assume that visitors will come and a similar level of economic activity will occur 
without regular, committed, and robust marketing campaigns. Colorado made that mistake in 
1993 when they eliminated their $12 million tourism marketing budget and lost over $2 billion 
annually for several years until they reinstated tourism marketing. It took 21 years for Colorado 
to regain the their share of overnight leisure travelers after the 1993 budget elimination.* 
Connecticut has had variable and unstable tourism marketing funding over the past 15 years.A 
2012 study examining the effects of different funding levels found that a $2 million decrease 
(from $15M to $13M) in marketing funds would results in a more than $10 million loss in tax 
revenue.** 
MTA has worked with the sponsor, Sen. Moore, and we appreciate her Willingness to 
coordinate with MTA and thetourism industry to propose removing the funding provision we 
oppose—the taking of the dedicated Tourism Marketing Fund money for this paving project. I 
want to thank Sen. Moore for her efforts. 
I’ll reiterate that our testimony in opposition relates only the funding source in the bill as 
written regarding the taking of $1 million per year from the Tourism Promotion Marketing 
Fund; and we have no objection to the goal of the bill or the sponsor’s suggested amendment. 
Thank you for your consideration of our testimony.
