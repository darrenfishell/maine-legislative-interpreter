Blue Hill Peninsula Chamber of Commerce
LD 1141
As president of the local Blue Hill peninsula Chamber of Commerce, I writing in opposition to 
LD1141. Our chamber represents towns in Hancock County that would see no direct benefits 
from the passing of this bill, but stand to gain from moneys given to the region through the 
State tourism budget. 
While improving and creating bike lanes is important, to remove marketing funds and provide 
them to the Maine Department of Transportation is not the way to do this. MaineDOT already 
has a budget that enables them to work with communities to develop bicycle and pedestrian 
infrastructure. Downeast Maine has a Planning Commission and Economic Council who also 
seek additional funds for bicycle infrastructure. 
Only 5% of the tax revenue generated by the hard work of restaurants and lodging places is 
directed back to supporting their businesses through tourism promotion. The rest goes into 
the General Fund to support the entire state budget. These businesses can't afford to lose the
financial support of the State tourism budget to other projects or state departments. 
LD1141 does not support our hospitality and tourist-centered businesses on the Blue Hill 
Peninsula.
