Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
members
of
the
Committee
On
Transportation,
my
name
is
Nathan
Davis,
and
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
Sierra
Club
Maine,
representing
over
22,000
supporters
and
members
statewide.
Founded
in
1892,
Sierra
Club
is
one
of
our
nation’s
oldest
and
largest
environmental
organizations.
We
work
diligently
to
amplify
the
power
of
our
3.8
million
members
nation-wide
as
we
work
towards
combating
climate
change
and
promoting
a
just
and
sustainable
economy.
To
that
end,
we
urge
you
to
consider
an
amendment
to
the
funding
mechanism
of
L.D.
1141
and
then
vote
“ought
to
pass
as
amended”.
We
generally
support
this
bill,
and
we
are
enthusiastic
about
promoting
active
transportation
in
Maine,
which
yields
broad
benefits
for
climate,
public
health,
and
equity.
Maine’s
Active
Transportation
Plan
specifically
recognizes
the
need
for
shoulder
improvements,
especially
along
rural
highways.
Indeed,
anyone
who
bikes
or
walks
along
Maine’s
rural
highways
and
roads
(including
myself)
knows
what
a
challenge
it
can
be,
especially
for
inexperienced,
young,
or
unconfident
cyclists.
Maine’s
state
parks
are
a
treasure,
and
we
warmly
support
making
them
more
accessible
to
people
traveling
by
bike
or
foot.
We
do
have
some
concerns
about
the
funding
mechanism
of
this
bill
as
written.
We
understand
that
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
has
worked
with
Sen.
Moore
to
draft
an
amendment
directing
MaineDOT
to
fund
this
work
as
part
of
its
implementation
of
the
State
Active
Transportation
Plan,
which
we
believe
would
be
more
appropriate
than
funding
it
via
the
Tourism
Marketing
Promotion
Fund
or
the
Parks
-
General
Operations
program.
We
encourage
you
to
support
this
amendment
and
vote
“ought
to
pass
as
amended”
on
L.D.
1141.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
Sincerely,
Nathan
Davis

Ph.D.
Sierra
Club
Maine
Legislative
Team
member
