Testimony of Victoria Foley  
 
In Opposition to  LD 1141 
 
An Act to Improve Access and System Preservation by Providing Shoulders and Bicycle 
Lanes on State Roadways Leading to State Parks and Other Significant Destinations  
 
Good afternoon,  Sen. C hipman , Rep. Williams , and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Transportation . I am Victoria Foley, legislative liaison for the Department of Economic and 
Community Development, and I am here to testify in opposition to  LD 1 141. 
 
While our department supports the creation of trails and visitation to state parks and our many 
other natural assets for visitors from within Maine and further afield, we are concerned about the 
portion of the bill that requests a transfer of marketing dol lars from the Tourism Marketing 
Promotion Fund. Those dollars are used to market our state to visitors from around the world, and 
taking funds from that purpose would impact the ability to do that.  
 
It is our understanding that the bill sponsor is working  with stakeholders to propose an amendment 
to the bill as currently drafted. We look forward to seeing that language and working toward a 
solution.  
  
Thank you for your time today. I would be happy to answer any questions or provide additional 
information  for your work session.
