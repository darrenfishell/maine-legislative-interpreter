IN OPPOSITION TO LD 1141  
 
An Act to Improve Access and System Preservation by Providing Shoulders and Bicycle Lanes on 
State Roadways Leading to State Parks and Other Significant Destinations  
 
April 4 , 202 3 
 
Senator  Chipman , Representative Williams , and members of the  Joint Standing  Committee  on 
Transportation , my name is Andy Cutko , and I  am the Director of the Bureau of Parks and 
Lands . I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry  
(DACF)  in opposition to  LD 1141 , Act to Improve Access and System Preservation by Providing 
Shoulders and Bicycle Lanes on State Roadways Leading to State Parks and Other Signi ficant 
Destinations . 
 
The intent of encouraging bike lanes is admirable  and is consistent with the Department’s  aims 
related to public health and climate -friendly recreation.  As the Committee considers this bill, 
however, I encourage you to take into account  a few significant factors.  
 
First, and most importantly , Section 3 of the bill proposes to move $1 million in general funding 
from State Parks – General Operations to the Maine Department of Transportation  for this 
initiative.  This amounts to nearly the entirety of the State Parks’ General Fund appropriation 
($1.027 million) to cover all expenses beyond Park staffing. These General Funds are 
fundamental  to support ing ongoing operations for State Parks, particularly in light of our record 
visitation levels  (3.3 million/year) over the past few years.  As drafted, we can not support this  
bill because of the crippling impact on our State Parks  and Historic Sites .   
 
Second, as specified  in Section 1 .C, the need for bike lanes should be assessed relative to the 
usage of the State Parks  but also  Historic Sites . Some Historic Sites, such as Fort Popham and 
Fort McClary, receive as much use as many State Parks ; Historic S ites should therefore be 
included in any assessment.  If suitable funding were identified that did not adversely affect our 
Parks and Historic Sites, t he Bureau would be glad to serve as a partner in such an assessment 
and prioritization process.  
 
I would gladly answer any questions now or at the work session.
