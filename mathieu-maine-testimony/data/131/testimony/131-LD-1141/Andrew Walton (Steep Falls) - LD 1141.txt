Senator Chipman and Rep. Williams, and esteem committee members, I support this 
bill and ask the committee to pass it. 
Our states tourism is important as we all know but I am worried we are not taking 
advantage of the opportunities to make it easier or more attractive to come to Maine. 
Biking has continued to increase and has shown to bring its own economic benefits. 
Please make it easier and safer for bicyclists to go to these destinations, this will help 
traffic, and promote active transportation in our state at the tourism level.
Thank you,
Andrew Walton
