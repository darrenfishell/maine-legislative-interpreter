From: Curt Dale Clark, Artistic Director, Maine State Music Theatre
I am writing in regards to LD 1141. I support the goal of widening the shoulders but I 
am against using the Tourism Promotion Marketing Fund as the source. This is a 
capital expense and the tourism fund is not to be used as a funding source for capital 
expenses.
