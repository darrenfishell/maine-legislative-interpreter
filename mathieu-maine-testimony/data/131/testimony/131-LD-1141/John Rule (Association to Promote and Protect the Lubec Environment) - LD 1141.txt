RE: LD 1411: An Act to Improve Access and System Preservation by Providing Shoulders and Bicycle 
Lanes on State Roadways Leading to State Parks and Other Significant Destinations
Date: March 28, 2023
We at the Association to Promote and Protect the Lubec Environment urge that this bill be 
given “Ought Not To Pass” status. While the intent to improve bicycle lanes is commendable, 
withdrawing funds from the already poorly-financed efforts to improve tourism is not. Within our 
community we have many businesses that depend on tourism, and even more residents who rely on tourist 
revenue as an important source of income. 
Providing a few extra miles of bicycle lanes, particularly in sparsely populated Washington 
County, will not attract more visitors, but we believe reducing the level of support services will lead to the 
opposite result. These funds are used to provide literature and other promotional materials, which we – 
and others – provide to potential out-of-state visitors on a year-round basis.
As constituents of the presenter of this bill, Senator Marianne Moore, we support many of her 
initiatives, but believe this one to be misguided. If passed, it will not result in increased tourism.
Yours Truly,
              
John D. Rule, President
