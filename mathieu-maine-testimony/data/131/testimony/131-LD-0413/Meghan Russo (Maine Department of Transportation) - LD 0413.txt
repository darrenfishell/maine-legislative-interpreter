Testimony of Meghan Russo 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131“ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
In Opposition to 413 
An Act to Require the Department of Transportation to Upgrade Route 1 Between Fort 
Kent and Van Buren 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Meghan Russo, Manager of Legislative and Constituent 
Services at MaineDOT. MaineDOT respectfully opposes LD 413, An Act to Require the 
Department of Transportation to upgrade Route 1 Between Fort Kent and Van Buren. 
LD 413 is an attempt to circumvent MaineDOT ’s work plan process, something we historically 
oppose. The bill, while in concept draft, would require us to upgrade Route 1 from Fort Kent to 
Van Buren. 
MaineDOT ’s current Work Plan includes several projects scheduled for Route l along the 
corridor outlined in LD 413. These include almost three miles of reconstruction in Van Buren 
scheduled for 2023, two additional miles of reconstruction scheduled for 2024 and two separate 
paving projects in Van Buren, also scheduled for 2024. MaineDOT is also seeking federal 
discretionary funding in support of two separate scheduled reconstruction projects from 
Frenchville to Fort Kent. 
In addition, the communities of Madawaska, Fort Kent, and Van Buren are all currently engaged 
in Village Partnership Initiatives (VPI) with MaineDOT. The VPI program is intended to 
provide planning to address village and downtown deﬁciencies to support quality of life and 
economic vitality. The approach is to study, evaluate, plan and scope transportation projects on 
or adjacent to the state and state aid highway systems that are requested by a community. These 
are intended to prepare for transformative special federal funding.

MaineDOT ’s Work Plan is compiled using asset management priorities. MaineDOT has 
prioritized this corridor, as evident by the scheduled Work within our current Work Plan. It is for 
these reasons that we urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on LD 413. Thank you.
