LD 590
Good afternoon Members of the HCI&FS Committee. I would like to express my 
enthusiastic support for:
LD 590 - RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to 
Establish a Right to Health Care.
Most of you are probably aware of the numerous universal healthcare bills that have 
been submitted during the past 13 years. Few were successful, although one became 
law without the Governor’s signature.  LD 1045 (The Maine Health Care Act) in the 
2021. However, in practical terms little has been accomplished in creating a true sea 
change that will provide guaranteed, comprehensive, medically necessary to every 
Maine resident. 
While we’re making strides, Maine continues to have 5.7% uninsured [over 77,000 
per 2021 federal data] and thousands more remain underinsured. That means we have 
to think long and hard before we go to see a doctor even in the most serious cases 
because of high copays and deductibles. The stress these agonizing decisions cause to 
individuals and families make things worse. Life doesn’t and shouldn’t have to be this
way! 
Passing LD 590 will set the stage, inform us all about our opportunity for real and 
practical improvements in ensuring better health and happier, more productive lives 
for all Mainers. Importantly, once achieved, universal healthcare will reduce overall 
costs by simplifying every aspect of the system for patients and providers alike. 
Please vote YES on LD 590.
Thank you all.
