Good morning, my name is Michel Pottier, I live in South Portland Maine. I 
wholeheartedly support this Resolution to establish the right to Healthcare in the state 
of Maine. 
I moved to Maine from Nova Scotia, to be with my wife who is a Mainer. I knew 
Healthcare was an issue here but I was shocked recently about how bad it has 
become. My wife recently had routine surgery at MaineMed in Portland. She has 
insurance, but she still needed to pay $6000 out of pockets which is financially 
crippling. Furthermore her insurance was billed over $80,000 for a surgery that would
have cost $12,000-$15,000 in Canada (if paying out of pocket). This is morally 
wrong, and having healthcare as a right will prevent this kind of profiteering on the 
backs of sick or injured Mainers. Furthermore if Maine wishes to attract skilled 
immigrants from countries with single payer healthcare they will lose every time. 
Who would risk financial ruin or the health of their children or family to move to 
Maine when they can get care for free at point of service from dozens of countries 
around  the world?
  
Lastly, I'm sure insurance companies will be present to oppose this, but I would like 
to inform the committee, that companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield support 
healthcare as a human right and single payer right next door in Nova Scotia, where 
they are contracted by the provincial government to run MSI (single payer 
healthcare). They know it works and fighting it in the USA is not only two faced, but 
ethically bankrupt. 
Thank you for your time, 
Michel Pottier
