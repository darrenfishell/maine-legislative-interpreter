LD 590
To members of the Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services Committee of 
the Maine Legislature:
I am writing in support of LD 590, a “RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to 
the Constitution of Maine to Establish a Right to Health Care.”
I urge the Maine legislature to give the people of Maine the opportunity to determine, 
by vote, whether or not they believe that health care for all Maine people should be a 
right or not. 
This is not a question of whether or not health care should be a right or a privilege, 
but rather the legislature simply enabling, rather than preventing, the people of Maine 
to speak for themselves on this issue. 
Please promote the democratic process in Maine by supporting LD 590. 
Sincerely,
Larry Dansinger
