Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
590:
"Resolution,
Proposing
an
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
Maine
to
Establish
a
Right
to
Health
Care"
Good
Morning
Senator
Bailey,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Maine
Legislature's
Committee
on
Health
Coverage,
Insurance,
and
Financial
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
590
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
this
bill
comes
from
a
compassionate
place.
If
we
wish
the
best
for
people,
shouldn’t
we
declare
their
“right”
to
all
the
things
that
make
life
comfortable
and
enjoyable?
Unfortunately,
while
powered
by
good
intentions,
feelings
do
not
make
good
public
policy
or
economic
sense.
Declaring
a
right
to
health
care
is
hollow
and
fragile.
It
is
akin
to
claiming
a
right
to
someone
else’s
work.
In
practice,
it
is
intellectually
lazy
and
cruel.
In
order
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
question,
we
must
agree
on
a
definition
of
rights.
Are
rights
conditional
or
are
they
eternal?
Rights
exist
independently
of
our
financial
or
social
status.
We
can
all
share
them
equally
at
the
same
time,
no
matter
the
condition
of
the
world.
If
something
requires
a
government,
company,
or
other
person
to
fulfill,
it
cannot
be
a
right.
If
we
each
own
our
bodies
and
our
minds,
we
have
a
right
to
our
lives.
If
we
have
a
right
to
life,
we
have
a
right
to
how
we
choose
to
apply
our
time—our
minds—in
the
world;
this
is
liberty.
If
you
own
your
mind,
body,
and
how
you
choose
to
apply
them
to
the
world,
then
you
own
the
fruits
of
that
labor:
your
property.
Every
human
retains
these
rights
at
all
times.
Each
ends
where
another
individual’s
right
to
life,
liberty,
or
property
begins.
So,
how
can
two
people
have
the
same
right
to
health
care
if
one
has
it
but
the
other
doesn’t?
The
simple
fact
that
some
of
us
are
homeless
or
starving
today
means
that
no
human
right
to
housing
or
to
food
exists.
These
are
merely
desires,
problems
not
solved
without
work
and
focus.

If
I
have
a
right
to
housing,
do
I
have
the
right
to
a
free
home,
built
by
my
neighbor,
the
busy
general
contractor?
If
I
have
a
right
to
healthcare,
do
I
have
a
right
to
my
doctor's
time
and
expertise,
whatever
amount
it
may
take
to
diagnose
and
treat
my
ailment?
Goods
and
services
cannot
be
rights,
because
one
cannot
have
a
right
to
another
person’s
labor
or
property.
If
we
own
the
fruits
of
our
labor,
then
it
is
never
right
to
take
from
another
without
their
consent.
Of
course
not.
Our
neighbors
are
not
our
slaves.
We
cannot
demand
they
work
for
us
for
free;
the
assertion
is
simply
immoral.
They
deserve
to
be
justly
compensated
for
the
massive
amount
of
time
and
focus
required
to
thrive
in
their
professions.
Just
because
a
service
is
highly
valuable
does
not
give
anyone
a
“right”
to
it.
Please
deem
LD
590
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
reject
this
misguided
interpretation
of
rights.
Rights
are
inherent,
individual,
and
eternal;
they
are
not
subject
to
conditions
of
the
moment.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
