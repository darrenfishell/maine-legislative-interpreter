Dear Chairperson and Committee members,
Please support the right of all people to basic health care. The American Nurses 
Association considers basic health care a right and have published an Agenda for 
Health Care Reform starting in 1989 and updated through the years. Nurses are 
Amerca's most trusted professionals and standing by patients, nurses understand why 
our humanity requires health care to be right. Over ten years ago, when asked what 
would be one of nurses' greatest future challenges, Muriel Poulin, the internationally 
respected nurse leader and administer, said that providing quality patient care in a for 
profit system would be a constant challenge.  Since then, private equity firms have 
moved into health care (and housing).  Basic human needs are being treated like 
commodities in the market place. The rules and regulations that at one time protected 
our common good seem to have become ineffective. I am a retired nurse educator, I 
have been on the South Portland city council for six years, finishing a term this 
December. Housing and health care are intimately interdependent. It is hard to work, 
obtain housing and support a family with untreated health problems. Profits, very 
large profits are being made by a few at the expense of many exhausted and ill souls.  
People who used to be middle class or lower middle class are now in positions of 
powerlessness that are almost impossible to untangle. We have blamed these victims 
while growing a class of oligarchs who are killing the America we love. We are the 
only developed nation in the world that does not have universal health care. Our 
health indicators are at a third world level and every day we shoot our children. 
Health care is a right endowed upon us, all of us, all people, by our Creator.
