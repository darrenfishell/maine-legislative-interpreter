Testimony 
In Support of 
LD 1608 An Act to Address Teacher Shortages Through Financial 
Assistance and Career Advancement Opportunities 
Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
April 20, 2023 
Senator Rafferty. Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, 
My name is Grace Leavitt. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51. I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certiﬁed teacher. The MEA 
represents nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well 
as in our institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine 
Community College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired 
educators. 
I am here to testify on behalf of MEA in support of LD 1608 An Act to Address Teacher Shortages 
Through Financial Assistance and Career Advancement Opportunities. 
I realize I am repeating what you have heard many times already this session and what I am sure you 
already were aware of prior to the beginning of the session—that we are experiencing a critical shortage 
of teachers across the state in a variety of content areas and at all levels of instruction. What we saw 
coming years ago has worsened all the more these last few years than even we had anticipated. You have 
already heard that better compensation is a top priority, and that there are also a number of initiatives 
proposed and even underway to help address the need for attracting and retaining greater numbers of 
qualiﬁed and prepared people to the profession. 
One of these initiatives is an already successful program, the Maine Teacher Residency Program. 
This program provides the training, the support, and the experience that ensures quality preparation for 
those seeking to become fully certiﬁed teachers. In addition, participants in the program are better able 
to pursue this path due to the ﬁnancial component of paid intemships, tuition support, and includes pay 
for the mentors who work with the participants. 
The program was made possible through the efforts of Dr. Flynn Ross and federal funding secured by 
Maine Senators King and Collins which will support the program for a second year. LD 1608 would 
provide what is needed for this program to continue beyond 2023-2024. 
MEA sees this program as playing a key role in addressing both the teacher shortage and meanwhile the 
program provides schools with much-needed staff as the interns ﬁll various support positions in districts 
across the state.
