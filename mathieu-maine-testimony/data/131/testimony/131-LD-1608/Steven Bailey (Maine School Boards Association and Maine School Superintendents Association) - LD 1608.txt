TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
L.D. 1608 
AN ACT TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES THROUGH FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1608. 
Our associations support the intent of this program and its goal, which is to encourage and support more 
students in Maine to go into teaching. The funding would go to the Maine Teacher Residency Program at the 
University of Southem Maine. 
The proposed $1 million in funding, which is described as ongoing, would go into the General Purpose Aid 
fund and provide loans of up to $8,000 per year for eligible students. 
This proposal would certainly be an incentive for students to go into the teacher residency program, but we 
would like to have more information. 
The bill discusses a MEPRI study on career ladders for educators and that makes sense, but we believe that 
study should come ﬁrst before funding is allocated. 
We also question why the funding is going into the General Purpose Aid account, which as you know is GPA 
for pre-K-12 schools and not for higher education. We didn’t think these funds should be commingled. How 
will that work‘?
