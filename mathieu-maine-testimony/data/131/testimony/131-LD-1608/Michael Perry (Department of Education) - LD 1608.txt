Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs: 
LD 1608, An Act to Address Teacher Shortages Through Financial Assistance and Career 
Advancement Opportunities proposes on-going funding to support the Maine Teacher Residency 
Program at the University of Southern Maine (U SM) and requires Maine Education Policy 
Research Institute to study the development of career ladders. 
The Maine education community faces growing teacher shortages, and We appreciate any 
innovative methods for supporting the development of our educator Workforce. By participating 
in a teacher residency program, an aspiring educator holding a BA outside of the educational 
ﬁeld can receive crucial experience Working in a classroom while taking evening courses to 
fuiish the requirements for teacher certification in Maine in one year. 
In addition to boosting teacher recruitment, there is evidence that educators leave residency 
programs feeling better prepared as a result of relationships they have developed in the 
community and the length of time they have spent in the classroom, leading to schools with 
higher teacher retention rates. 
The Department offers two suggestions for the Committee to consider. First, we suggest 
changing the language in Section 2 to be inclusive of all alternative teacher preparation pilots. 
The USM teacher residency program is a good model that should be supported, and the 
Department of Education would like the ﬂexibility to support other innovative teacher 
preparation programs. Second, should funding go to the Department for this bill, We recommend 
moving the funds out of General Purpose Aid to a speciﬁc fund Within the Educator Excellence 
team within the Higher Education and Educator Support Services Team at the Department. 
Sincerely,
