RE:   LD 1608 An Act to Address Teacher Shortages Through Financial Assistance 
and Career Advancement Opportunities 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs:  
I am writing to you today in support of LD 1608  
My name is Phyllis Wentworth and I participated in the Maine Teacher Residency Program last 
year, as a Resident Intern at Biddeford Primary School. I hope this excellent program will continue 
to be funded by LD 1608 after the federal funds run out in 2024.  
The program gave me a chance to have my own small class of students, under the mentorship of 
an experienced and award-winning teacher. The funding made it feasible for me to afford to enroll 
in USMâ€™s Extended Teacher Education Program, through which I obtained access to the 
Residency Program.  
Please do all that you can to support LD 1608 and keep this program going past 2024.  
Thank you.
