 
 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  (MMA)  
 
In Support of  
LD 510, An Act to Protect the Public Health by Allowing the Appointment of Associated Health 
Officers   
 
March 2 2, 2023  
 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer  and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in support of LD 510 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Associationâ€™s Legislative 
Policy Committee and  directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
Municipal leaders support this legislation as a commonsense solution that provides 
communities the flexibility necessary to respond to public health threat s.  Allowing an associated 
health  officer to work under the direction of the appointed Local Health Officer, who is bound by 
the training standards and qualifications established  in stat e statute, will enable communities to 
put into place the support system s necessary to ensure that all residen ts and guest s are protected 
when public health is at risk.  Simply put, t he approach enable s municipalities to tap into the 
knowledge  of residents who are willing to lend a hand .   
It is solutions of this nature that help to strengthen state/municipal partners hip. For that 
reason, municipal leader s urge your support of LD 510.    
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 592 -4038.
