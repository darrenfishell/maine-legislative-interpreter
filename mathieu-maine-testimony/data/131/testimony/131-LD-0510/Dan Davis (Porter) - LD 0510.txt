LD 510
Senator Baldacci, Rep Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,
I fully support LD510, as it is competent and reasonable legislation to update a 15 
year old law.
In 2007 when this law was created, we had not yet experienced the housing crash, a 
2-year pandemic, and the years and years of increasing inflows of opioids that we 
have today.
Communities are increasingly struggling with being the first-responders to the mental 
health, drug, and homelessness epidemics, and need more options.
This provides support for an underutilized but critically needed service in these 
communities, to bridge between the state, law enforcement, code enforcement, town 
officials, and residents.
I've found over the years that during the administration and enforcement of land 
use/codes, CEO's are increasingly the unintended frontline first responders to the 
accelerating drug, mental health, and homelessness crisis here in the State. It is 
becoming increasingly dangerous and time-consuming, and the State affords little 
support to communities regarding these socio-economic challenges. Our only tool is 
financial and punitive (30-A section 4452), to address problems where there is no 
money to be found, money won't solve the underlying issues, and where other social 
service intervention is needed. 
I urge the Committee to support LD510 to allow communities to expand the LHO 
support in their towns, as needed.
Thank you,
Dan Davis - Porter
