Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 734, An Act to Authorize the Treasurer of State and Municipalities to 
Invest in Gold, Silver and Other Precious Metals 
“In varying degrees, just about all of us are intrigued by gold. Throughout human history, humans have 
been inﬂuenced by this heraldic metal. We have envied those who have it, pitied those who do not, 
moved to where it could be mined, and fought or robbed one another to obtain more of it.”

Chairs and Honorable Members: 
We respectfully oppose L.D. 734. The question that should be asked by the Committee is not whether 
precious metals are a good investment. Precious metals may be a good investment. Rather, the 
Committee should ask whether precious metals are an appropriate investment Within the State’s 
internal investment portfolio that is sourced by tax dollars and used to pay our expenses and- 
expenditures on a frequent basis. We believe precious metals are not. 
Dollars coming from taxpayers directly to the State or through the Federal govermnent must be invested 
with safety, liquidity and yield (in that order) in mind. It is somewhat unclear which investmentsz in 
‘ Bob Strong taught at the University of Maine as a Professor of Investment Education and Professor of Finance. He now 
serves on the University of Maine Board of Visitors. His textbook on portfolio management is used at many other 
institutions. 
2 Investment in precious metal futures or precious metal related public or private equities are gig a proper investment forY 
State government and would contravene current statute and policy. Hypothetically, investments in companies in the precious 
metal business are allowed through the purchase of the highest rated commercial paper instruments and corporate bonds.

precious metals are contemplated by L.D. 734. It seems most likely the bill intends to allow investment 
in physical precious metal assets or certiﬁcates. 
Such investments are not sufﬁciently safe for the short-term investing3 conducted by State government. 
Precious metals have a price volatility that could lead to losses if the State had immediate cash needs. 
The same is true for public equities and Treasury does not invest funds within the general cash pool in 
public equities. Losses, especially in ﬁscally difficult times, will invite warranted public attention and 
disappointment. Consider this chart4 that shows the price of gold in USD on the London Fix in the past 
year.

By law, Treasury may not invest in federal obligations with maturities exceeding 36 months or commercial paper or 
corporate bonds with maturities exceeding 24 months. 4 Yields on federal paper are also volatile but it is important to keep in mind that in a federal paper transaction, the State isa buyer. If the State were to invest in precious metal assets, hold them and need to sell them, the State as a seller bears the risk of price volatility. T Bills (maturities of 4-52 weeks) are bought at a discount and are guaranteed to pay back face value at 
maturity. Treasury Notes (2-3 year maturities) pay a ﬁxed rate of interest every six months until they mature plus face value. Other federal obligations like Fannie Mae debt securities have a ﬁxed interest rate. Further, the State can better plan and budget by knowing the guaranteed maturity dates and yields of federal paper. The same is not true of precious metals.

Storing physical bars of precious metals would be costly and could present liquidity challenges 
especially if the State’s investment in precious metals is meant to reduce inﬂation risk. Precious metals 
could bring yields in a volatile market but would require active management beyond current practice. 
Overall, Maine law and the Treasurer ’s investment policy are wisely conservative and successful. For 
example, earnings on the B.S.F. alone were $1,797,065.70 in February 2023 and ﬁscal year-to-date 
earnings as of the end of March 2023 were $55,983,707.29.0 
We do appreciate the sponsor’s interest in our functions and make no judgment about investments in 
precious metals made my individuals and others, but respectfully object to these changes to State law 
governing investments of public dollars.
