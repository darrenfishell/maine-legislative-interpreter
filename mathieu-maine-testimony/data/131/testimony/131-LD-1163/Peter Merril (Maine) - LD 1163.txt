Selection Criteria 
 
The Cultural Affairs Council will use the following general selection criteria in 
awarding grants. The funds available will not meet the demand, therefore priorities 
must be set. These criteria set both policy priorities as well as practical requirements 
to ensure that the limited funds will be put to the best use and have the most impact. 
1) Projects that will preserve and improve the State’s historic, arts, and cultural 
structures. Projects must be eligible for inclusion on the National Historic 
Register. 
 
2) Projects that will enhance community and economic development. 
 
3) Non-profits and municipalities may apply.  
4) Target smaller organizations with fewer resources. Operating budget may not 
exceed $2,000,000 for non-profits; no limit for municipalities. 
 
5) Pressing need. The immediacy of the work to be done. 
 
6) Rehab, repair, and expansion. Any requests for expansion must support the 
existing use.

complete the work and implement an ongoing maintenance plan.
