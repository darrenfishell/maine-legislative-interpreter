The Grand
LD 1163
Like many historic and uniquely Maine arts and cultural venues, The Grand has been 
a community anchor for many years. It is quintessentially New England glowing at 
the top of Ellsworth's Main Street on many a foggy night, welcoming neighbors and 
families and friends from away for over 80 years. But to continue this legacy and 
compete for time and attention, it needs significant improvements from air handling to
expanded bathrooms, lobby, and concessions to modern seating. An investment now 
will be paid back many-fold in the years to come as the 80+ year old venue is 
comfortable and inviting to all. It will be able to drive the downtown economy all 
year instead of being closed in the summer months and partons will be able to take 
their coats, scarves and hats off in the winter. Given the opportunity, The Grand (and 
many more venues) will be a vital part of a proud Maine.
