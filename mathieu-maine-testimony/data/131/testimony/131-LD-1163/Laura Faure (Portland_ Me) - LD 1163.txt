I am writing to strongly advocate for passage of bonds LD 912 and LD1163 currently 
being discussed in committee. I have been among Maine’s cultural leaders for over 40
years as the former director of the Bates Dance Festival and current Board Vice 
President of Bearnstow, a non-profit arts camp in Mount Vernon, ME that is listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places. 
Maine’s arts and cultural assets are many, varied and tremendously important to our 
economic vitality, our ability to attract visitors from across the globe and young 
creative talent to keep our work force and community vibrant and growing. 
As a vital and highly diversified sector of our state infrastructure, investing in the 
preservation and expansion of our arts and cultural assets is one of the wisest 
investments we can make to insure our continued vitality. As crucial as our 
commitment to climate initiatives, food and housing solutions, and other critical 
issues facing our state, securing out cultural assets will help guaranty a bright future.  
I have personally witnessed the economic and artistic impact of attracting hundreds of
performing artists to Maine each summer to study, perform and create new work that 
left it’s  mark on Maine audiences. I urge you to advance these bonds and enhance our
proud Maine artistic treasures. 
Sincerely,
Laura Faure
