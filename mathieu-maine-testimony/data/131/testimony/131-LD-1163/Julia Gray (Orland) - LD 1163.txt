LD 1163
Chair Rotundo, Chair Sachs, and honorable members of the committee, thank you for 
this opportunity to testify in support of LD 1163.
As the executive director of the Wilson Museum, I am very much aware of the 
growing costs to repair and improve the arts and cultural buildings under my care. 
The Wilson Museum has a 5-acre campus with four buildings, several of which are 
also historic buildings. Beyond just the aging that impacts our buildings, we are also 
faced with the growing impact of climate change on our buildings, especially as we 
are situated right on the shores of Castine Harbor/Penobscot Bay, and on a small, 
rocky peninsula where stormwater run-off is a growing challenge. There are also 
improvements in building technologies that can make it substantially less expensive to
operated arts and cultural buildings, such as LED lighting and heat pumps.
This past year, with support from Maine Preservation, we worked with a consultant to
do a historic structures assessment of two of our historic buildings, the ca. 1783 
Perkins House and our 1921 concrete and masonry museum building. We now have 
an extensive list of projects to tackle for both, and we will definitely need financial 
help to do this work. In addition, we know that the efficiency and sustainability of our
other buildings (both environmentally and financially) could be improved through 
investments in building envelope, heating, and lighting. The initial capital costs, 
however, will need additional financial support. 
LD 1163 has the potential to make a huge difference for the Wilson Museum and 
other arts and cultural buildings across the state, allowing us to continue to fulfill our 
missions, serve our communities, and support the local and state economy.
I urge the committeeâ€™s support of LD 1163.
Thank you,
Julia Gray, Orland
