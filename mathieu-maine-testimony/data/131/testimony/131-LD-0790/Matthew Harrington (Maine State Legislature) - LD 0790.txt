Senator, District 33 131st Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Testimony of Senator Matthew Harrington 
In Support of LD 790, "An Act to Require Disclosure for Communications Paid for Using Maine 
Clean Election Act Funding" 
15 March 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal 
Affairs, I am Senator Matthew Harrington, and I have the honor of serving the communities of 
Waterboro, Alfred, Lebanon and Sanford. I am pleased to sponsor LD 790, "An Act to Require 
Disclosure for Communications Paid for Using Maine Clean Election Act Funding. ” 
This is a simple bill to provide more transparency in Maine elections. It would require a disclaimer 
on political material of Clean Election Candidates stating that the communication was, “paid for 
using Maine Clean Election Act funds.” Clean Elections are paid for by Maine tax dollars, so simply 
saying, “paid for and authorized by the candidate ” is not true. The communication may have been 
authorized by the candidate, but it was paid for by the taxpayers. 
I think we can all agree political communications have vastly increased in the past few cycles. This 
committee has done a great deal of work to ensure Maine people know how political communications 
are paid for. I think this is the next step. 
I thank the committee for their consideration and I would be happy to answer any questions.
