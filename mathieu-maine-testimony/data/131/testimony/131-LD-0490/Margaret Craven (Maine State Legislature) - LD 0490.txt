Testimony of Representative Margaret Craven introducing 
LD 490, An Act to Designate the Department of Health and Human Services as the 
Implementing Department of the Lead-safe Housing Registry 
Before the Health and Human Services Committee 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and fellow members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, my name is Margaret Craven, and I represent House District 93, which 
includes part of Lewiston. I am here today to present LD 490, An Act to Designate the 
Department of Health and Human Services as the Implementing Department of the Lead- 
safe Housing Registry. 
This bill designates the Department of Health and Human Services as the agency responsible for 
implementing the registry of leased lead-safe residential dwellings. Currently, the Department of 
Environmental Protections has this oversight. 
Where this bill comes at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, I would 
ask that you save your questions for their representative who is here today. Thank you for your 
time.
