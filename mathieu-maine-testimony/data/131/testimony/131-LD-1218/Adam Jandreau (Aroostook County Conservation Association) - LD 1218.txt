 Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (ACF), my name is Adam 
Jandreau from Caribou, Maine. I am a registered Maine Guide, Licensed 
Professional Engineer (Maine) and currently on the board of directors, and acting 
Secretary, for the Aroostook County Conservation Association (known locally as 
the “ACCA”). I’m speaking here today on behalf the ACCA, and our members, and 
we appreciate the opportunity to provide our Association’s support of L.D. 1218. 
 
The ACCA was founded 15 years ago and our mission is to “preserve, protect, and 
enhance” the whitetail deer herd in Aroostook County. Our membership is spread 
throughout Aroostook County from Allagash to St. David, Fort Kent to Benedicta. 
Our conservation strategies to support this mission involve 3 critical programs: 
habitat improvement, supplemental winter feeding and predator management.  
 
Specific to habitat and improvements, the ACCA has watched for years as private 
landowners have severely limited the white-tailed deer’s winter habitat, in our 
region, through their wood harvesting practices. Although great strides are being 
made, through legislation, to protect what’s left of the northern Maine deer herd 
we’ve taken note that the Bureau of Parks and Lands has also been harvesting 
wood in known deer wintering habitat.

Testimony In Support of L.D. 1218 
"An Act Establishing a System to Appeal Administrative Actions or 
Management Plans of the Bureau of Parks and Lands" 
Before the  
Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (ACF)

 ACCA supports L.D. 1218 because it provides an opportunity for ensuring the 
correct balance is achieved in managing public lands for its historical uses, 
recreation, and wildlife. ACCA is aware the Bureau is required to update a 
regional “Management Plan” for its holdings and the Plan is subject to public 
input. However, the Plan is driven by career employees who depend on revenues 
from harvesting operations resulting in a conflict of interest. 
 
Locally, in Aroostook County, we can provide three examples, within the last year, 
that BPL has started, or planned to start, cutting operations in mapped, or known, 
deer wintering habitat. The first in Hamlin BPL, the second in the Fall Brook Lake 
BPL (Allagash) and third in Salmon Brook Lake BPL (Perham).  In all three 
situations, the public, or ACCA members, brought to attention the disregard to 
this mapped or known habitat. In Fall Brook Lake there was no response to 
concerns about the winter habitat being cut (nothing we could do to stop it). In 
Hamlin, ACCA worked successfully to reduce the cutting of winter habitat. In 
Salmon Brook Lake the operation was postpone a year. In the latter example, the 
only reason for this postponement was due to a December 2022 membership 
meeting in which a presenting David Trahan (SAM) was informed, by an ACCA 
member, of the proposed harvest situation in Salmon Brook Lake.  
 
L.D. 1218 will establish an independent appeal process to deal with adverse 
Bureau decisions affecting wildlife, recreation, historical traditions, and 
harvesting. It will give a better voice to sportsmen on matters related to wildlife 
and recreation. If it works, unacceptable Bureau decisions may not have to go to 
court or to the Legislature for resolution.   
 
The appeals office must be timely and independent from the Bureau and outside 
special interest groups.  Thank you for your time and consideration of ACCA’s 
support of L.D. 1218. 
 
Adam Jandreau 
ACCA Secretary
