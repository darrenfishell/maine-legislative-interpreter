I am writing on behalf of the Paine family. We have a camp on Azicohos Lake in 
Lincoln Plantation that is part of the State Leased land program. We are in full 
support of the bills that are being discussed Wednesday 4/5 for leased landowners. 
My grandmother Patricia Paine purchased the camp back in 1975 for $1200. It was 
her dream to own a camp there. She died of cancer just 2 years later. For the past 48 
years everyone in the family has had a hand in helping make improvements. We have 
worked to preserve the camp to what it is today, a beautiful camp on the water. Our 
grandmother would have been so proud. Our plan is to continuously make 
improvements so we can leave camp for our children to enjoy for years to come. We 
have so many great memories. 
Keeping Paine Family history alive!!
