Testimony on LD 1218 An Act Establishing a System to Appeal Administrative 
Actions or Management Plans of the Bureau of Parks and Lands and LD 1219 An 
Act to Establis Rights for Holders of Certain Leases and Easements on Land 
Managed by the Bureau of Parks and Lands 
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry,  my name is Bill Huntress.  I am 
from Palermo, Maine and I own a camp lease on the Machias River Maine Public 
Reserved Lands on Fourth Machias Lake in T42 MD BPP.  I have enjoyed Fourth 
Machias Lake for 50 years and owned a camp there for over 25 years.  I would like to 
offer testimony in support of both LD 1218 and LD 1219. 
 
Owning this camp for so many years I have seen many changes in land ownership and 
land management.  I have had a good relationship with the Bureau of Public Lands staff 
through the years and have no complaints.  My primary concerns are that my family can 
continue to use and enjoy our camp for years to come and we can maintain these rights 
and use of the lands.  Having these rights set in statue would provide me with peace of 
mind knowing that the love of the camp lands can be passed down to the generation of 
our family.  I urge you to support these bills. 
 
Thank you, 
William Huntress, Jr.
