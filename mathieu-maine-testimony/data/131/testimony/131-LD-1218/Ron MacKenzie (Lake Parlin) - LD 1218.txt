 
Testimony In Support of L.D. 1218  
"An Act Establishing a System to Appeal Administrative Actions or  
Management Plans of the Bureau of Parks and Lands " 
Before the  
Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (ACF)  
Wednesday, April 5, 2023, at 1:00 PM  
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (ACF), my name is Ron 
MacKenzie  from Lake Parlin , Maine. I am a Registered Master Maine Guide, 
Master Taxidermist (52 years – retired), and Trapper.  
 
Traditional and primitive camp owners a re very good stewards  of the land. And, in 
some instances the first line of defense. In my case , two times stopping  what 
could have been two large forest fires.  
Also at least in my case , I and other lessees have rules and regulation s to abide by  
that I feel are fair. That being said , any camp owner worth his salt knows the 
piece of grou nd he traps , hunts , fishes , and recreates on like the back of his hand. 
So let him have his say in what is happening on his piece of sacred ground.   
Ask us our thoughts  before making changes . We all kno w our piece of wood  
better than anyone. My camp’s name happens to be “Sacred Ground”.  
If you want to hear  more ramblings call  me as I have no email  and no computer. 
Just a traditionalist after all.  
Thank you for your time.
