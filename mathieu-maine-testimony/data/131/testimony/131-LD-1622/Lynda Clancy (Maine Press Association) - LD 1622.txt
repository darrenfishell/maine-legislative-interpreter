 Testimony of  Maine Press Association  Honorable Anne Carney, Senate Chair  Honorable Matt Moonen, House Chair   Joint Legislative Committee on Judiciary  April 26, 2023  RE: LD 1622, “Resolve, to Reestablish the Criminal Records Review Committee Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of  the Committee on Judiciary:  The Maine Press Association supports this legislation.  We believe the work of  the Criminal Records Review Committee that was initiated in 2021 is vital to fully understanding, and further developing, Maine rules regarding public access to criminal records and processes, which are complex and affect many citizens in different ways.  The MPA believes, however, that surface has just been scratched and much for study — and thoughtful conversations — are in order.  We support LD 1622, and the intent to keep this fairly new committee, which represents a broad spectrum of  important voices, on task with continued collaborative efforts. Most importantly, the Criminal Records Review Committee needs time to do its work with thoughtful and methodical processes fundamental to democracy.  Thank you for your time and consideration,  Maine Press Association Legislative Committee: Lynda Clancy, Editorial Director, Penobscot Bay Pilot Joe Charpentier, Lewiston Sun Journal David Dahl, Editor, Maine Monitor Jodi Jalbert, Publisher, Sun Media Group Dan MacLeod, Managing Editor, Bangor Daily News Judith Meyer, Executive Editor, Sun Journal, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel  Marian McCue, Editor, Portland Phoenix Courtney Spencer, VP of  Advertising, Portland Press Herald Maia Zewert, Editor, Lincoln County News
