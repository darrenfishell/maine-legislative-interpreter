TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ. 
Ought to Pass — LD 1622 
Resolve, To Reestablish and Continue the 
Work of the Criminal Records Review Committee 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON IUDICIARY 
April 27, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, and I am Policy Counsel at the 
ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to advancing and preserving civil rights and 
civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we urge 
you to support this bill because it would continue an important process to free Mainers from the 
debilitating unintended consequences of criminal records, extending the promise of our 
constitution to all people in our state. 
For as long as there have been criminal laws, a criminal record has prevented people from 
continuing their education, getting housing, a professional license, credit, investments, and other 
features of a stable, digniﬁed life. The 129"‘ and 130*“ Legislatures were aware of this problem 
when they created, and extended, the Criminal Records Review Committee (“the Committee ”),a 
bipartisan group of stakeholders that included advocates, law enforcement, and representatives 
from the parts of the state responsible for the logistics of criminal records sealing and 
expungement.1 
In its ﬁnal report, published in late 2021, the Committee generated three recommendations, 
one of which was to re-establish the Committee. The ACLU has been a part of this group since 
October of 2019. We can attest that the group barely scratched the surface of the issue. Automatic 
sealing, sealing of Class A, B, and C crimes, or consequences for entities that illegally share sealed

consumed with presentations. We learned of the state’s byzantine system for storing criminal 
records, but we hardly discussed substantive options to redress the many unintended consequences 
of these records. This bill would allow the group to continue building on the work that went before 
it. 
We urge you to vote ought to pass. 
Thank you for your time and attention.
