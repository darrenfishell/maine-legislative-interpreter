Re:  LD 997 Resolve (H.P. 633), 
Dear Representative Suzanne Salisbury and Senator Ingwersen, and 
Representatives Madigan, Perry, Graham, Brennan : 
As a licensed psychologist in Maine, I am writing in opposition to LC997. 
I am a psychologist in Independent Practice in the town of Bucksport, 
Maine. I work with Child, Adolescents and Families. 
While I agree we have a emergent critical situation of not enough 
providers to serve the children of Maine, it is my professional opinion the 
BHP system in Maine (and many other states) is very broken. 1st, only 
children with MaineCare are eligible for these services. BHP wait lists are 
extensive. BHP supports are provided to the most disabled children of our 
state. 
YET…..the providers of these services often have the least education 
(only HS) and are paid the very least of any mental health provider.  
Honestly it should be the opposite. The most severely disturbed children 
in Maine should be serviced by the most advanced Mental Health 
providers because we have the knowledge to provide healing that may 
prevent future significant problems in adulthood, thereby saving the state 
the extremely expensive expenditures required to support a client over 
their entire life -time (consider homelessness, prison/jails, mental health 
services, housing services, food stamps, MaineCare etc.). 
It is my opinion the service should be completely overhauled ASAP in 
order to best serve the children and their families in Maine. 
Respectfully submitted,
Kim Tousignant, Psy.D.
