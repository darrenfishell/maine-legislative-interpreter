SUBIECT: Testimony on L.D. 185 - An Act to Reduce the Benefit Penalty Imposed on Career 
Educators Who Retire After 35 Years of Service 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Ioint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Kathy Morin, and VI am the Director of 
Actuarial and Legislative Affairs for the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. 
MainePERS is neither for nor against L.D. 185. We are here to provide information and offer 
any assistance the Committee might need regarding this bill. It is our understanding that the 
bill as drafted does not reflect the intent of the sponsor and that an amendment will be offered 
to provide clarification. Our testimony is based on that amended language. 
Under current plan provisions, there are two ways by which a teacher becomes eligible to 
retire. One way is by completing twenty-five years of service and the other is by reaching the 
applicable normal retirement age, which is age 60, 62, or 65 depending on service requirements 
at specific dates set in law. A teacher who reaches twenty-five years of service prior to reaching 
normal retirement age may retire with a reduction, approximately 2.125% for teachers in the 
age 60 plan and 6% for teachers in the age 62 and 65 plans, for each year below normal 
retirement age. The reduction reﬂects that benefits will be paid to the retiree over a longer 
period of time. In essence, lower benefits paid over a longer period of time equate to a higher, 
unreduced benefit, being paid over a fewer number of years. 
As amended, L.D. 185 proposes to allow all teachers with at least thirty-five years of service to 
retire with an early retirement reduction of approximately 2.125% per year, regardless of the 
normal retirement age of the plan in which they participate. So, for example, a teacher who 
has a normal retirement age of 62 and is age 58 would currently be subject to a reduction of 
24% (4 years x 6% per year). Under this proposal, the teacher would instead be subject toa 
reduction of approximately 8.5% (4 years x 2.125%). 
L.D. 185 will have a fiscal impact because the Constitution does not allow the creation of new 
or additional benefits unless immediately and fully funded. New benefits are created under

L.D. 185 because a teacher would be receiving higher benefits than currently accounted for 
and funded, creating a new unfunded actuarial liability (UAL). We estimate an approximate 
$49 .11. . . . .. .. 
mi ion increase to the UAL if this bill is enacted. Additionally, we estimate an ongoing 
increased normal cost of approximately $1.1 million per year. 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony. I Would be happy to answer your 
questions and will be available at your Work session.
