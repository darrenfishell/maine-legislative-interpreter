 The attached CMP compilation of net energy billing costs should make you want to 
pause or expire the NEB program at a time when electric customers are struggling to 
pay bills and pay for food. 
This program supplies energy during daylight hours only. Obviously, this energy has 
no effect on wholesale prices. Any energy producing plant output it replaces will gain 
any lost revenue during peak hour supply periods 
Cost shifting, at the retail level from customers to solar developers and cost shifting 
from sunshine hours to peak hours makes this program counterproductive. 
Stop this failed program and work on a plan that has real benefits, bwfore it is too 
late.
