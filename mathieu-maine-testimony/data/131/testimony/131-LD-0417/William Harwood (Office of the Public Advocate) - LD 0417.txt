Testimony Neither For Nor Against 
LD 417, “An Act to Facilitate Net Energy Billing” 
.\‘larch 2, Z023 
Senator l.a\vrence, Representative Zeigler and distinguished members or thejoint 
Standing Committee on l-Inergy, Utilities, and Technology, 
My name is \X~‘illll211 ’T1 llatwood and l am the Public ;\dvocate, here today to testify 
neither for nor against l.D 417, “}\n ,\ct to liacilitate \et llnergy Billing. ” 
One of the problems regarding the net energy billing program is that the utility billing 
system needed to support the program is complicated. Section 3 of LD 41?’ would add 
additional requirements that could result in very expensive billing system upgrades For 
utilities. Utility ratepayers should not be responsible For expensive billing system upgrades 
that onl _y beneﬁt a small subset of customers that are enrolled in net energy billing projects. 
The net energy billing program already shifts costs to those ratepayers that are not enrolled 
in the program and this bill would likely increase that cost shitting. 
The ()P:\ shares the concern motivating this bill but believes further analysis is 
required to; analyze the cost or information exchange platform that would allow 
information sharing between the customer, the utility, and the project sponsor; analyze 
the feasibility of the time requirements set Forth in the bill; and (3) determine whether other 
funding mechanisms may exist such that utility ratepayers are not responsible for paying for 
costly upgrades that only beneﬁt project sponsors and those customers enrolled in net 
energy billing. 
Due to the complexities involved, this subject may be better addressed through a 
PLYC rulemaking proceeding rather than through legislation. (. K Ki (
