Re: LD 75, An Act to Establish Maximum Contaminant Levels Under the State's Drinking Water 
Rules to Prohibit Certain Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Committee: 
 
I am writing to express the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) position regarding LD 75, 
An Act to Establish Maximum Contaminant Levels Under the State's Drinking Water Rules to Prohibit 
Certain Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). The Department is neither for nor against 
this bill. 
 
L.D. 75 amends Resolve 2021, Chapter 82 which became effective on June 21, 2021, and requires that the 
Department of Health and Human Services to establish a maximum contaminant level (MCL).  This bill 
requires the MCL to be set equivalent to zero nanograms per liter for certain perfluoroalkyl and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  Resolve 2021, Chapter 82 established an interim drinking water 
standard of 20 nanograms per liter for the Sum of 6 PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, and 
PFDA).   
 
The DEP is currently investigating soil and groundwater at sites licensed by DEP for the land application 
of sludge and septage in Maine.  As of April 14, 2023, the DEP has sampled over 2,100 wells and has 
initiated or completed the installation of approximately 400 filtration systems.  The DEP coordinates and 
pays for the installation and maintenance of a filtration system when water supplies exceed Maine’s 
interim drinking water standard for the Sum of 6 PFAS.  The average cost for a typical carbon filter 
system is approximately $3,400.  This cost does not include additional costs for the installation of a pre-
treatment system, such as a softener, if it is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the carbon filter system 
nor does it include the cost of housing the system in a shed if one is needed due to space constraints.  If an 
MCL were to be established at a non-detect (ND) level, the DEP estimates that at least an additional 360 
filter systems would need to be installed.  This number is based only on the number of wells that have 
been sampled to date and have not exceeded the ND level.  Because laboratories cannot detect to true

zero, there could be more wells impacted that might need systems that we are not aware of at this time. 
Also, this number of additional filter systems does not include all future systems that may need to be 
installed at wells that have not yet been sampled. 
  
The installation of an additional 360 filter systems would cost the State approximately $1.2 million 
dollars.  Monitoring and maintenance of these systems would cost about $1.8 million dollars annually if 
the rate of filter media changeout and sampling is assumed to be once per year.  It is important to keep in 
mind that there may be as many as 370,000 private drinking water wells in Maine and depending on what 
value is established for the MCL at both the federal and state levels, DEP may need to install many more 
filter systems.  For frame of reference, using the average costs spent on private well sampling and filter 
systems so far, if all 370,000 private drinking water wells were to be sampled and need filtration systems, 
the costs could exceed $1.5 billion dollars. 
 
The DEP shares CDC’s concern with the practical challenges and abilities of analytical equipment to 
effectively and accurately achieve a detection limit of zero nanograms per liter.  Proposing such a limit 
may unintentionally cause data quality issues and make it difficult to provide data driven decisions and 
solutions.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide this information.  I am available to answer questions of the 
Committee, both now and at work session. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Susanne Miller 
Director, Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management
