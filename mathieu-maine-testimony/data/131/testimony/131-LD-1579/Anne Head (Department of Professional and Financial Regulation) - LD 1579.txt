TESTIMONY OF ANNE L. HEAD 
Commissioner, Department of Professional and Financial 
Regulation 
Neither for Nor Against LD 1579 
“RESOL U TION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Eliminate the 
Diversion of Revenue from Professional and Occupational Licensing Fees” 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON INNOVATION, 
DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT AND BUSINESS 
Presented by 
Representative Joshua Morris 
Public Hearing: April 18, 2023, at 1:15 pm 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and Members ofthe Committee, my name is Anne Head. I serve as 
Commissioner ofthe Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. I appear today to speak with you about 
LD I579. 
I would ﬁrst like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the bill Sponsor and cosponsors for their commitment to 
protecting the ﬁnancial integrity ofthe Department ’s licensing entities. The Department ’s agencies, licensing 
boards, and commissions within and afﬁliated with it operate solely on licensing fees paid to the Department by 
individuals and businesses that are licensed and regulated by DPFR agencies. These regulatory agencies receive no 
general fund revenue. 
For many years, this Department and its leaders have faced periodic diversions of dedicated revenue during the 
budget process for purposes other than those within the Depar“tment’s enabling statute. Each time, agency leaders 
have asserted that dedicated revenue is just that, dedicated to pay the regulatory expenses of a particular state entity 
that has no other source of revenue. DPFR agencies are critical to the lives of Maine citizens in so many ways. 
Diversion of dedicated revenue threatens the continuity and predictability of regulation that protects Maine citizens 
and businesses. 
While I cannot stress strongly enough how much the Department appreciates the intent, in the department ’s opinion, 
this may not arise to the level ofa constitutional amendment. Ifthe Committee was so inclined, we would instead 
recommend that this goal be accomplished by statute. 
I would be happy to answer any questions now or at the work session.
