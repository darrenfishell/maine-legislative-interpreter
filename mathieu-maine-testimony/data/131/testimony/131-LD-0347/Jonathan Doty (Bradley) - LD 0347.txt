LD 347
Dear Senators and Representatives, 
Thank you for your service to the state of Maine.  I submit this testimony in SUPPORT of LD 
347.  I manage a set of three apartments, and work hard to meet my responsibilities to my 
tenants.  I unfortunately have had to go through the F.E.D. process once, for a tenant who 
simply stopped paying rent.  The process was so lengthy that it struck me as state-sponsored
theft.  It was particularly frustrating, living next door, to know the tenant was home but refused
to answer the door when the sheriff arrived with the writ of possession.  It appears that LD 
347 would make this process more efficient, while still ensuring there are protections for 
tenants' rights. 
Thank you for your service, 
Jon Doty
