Distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee 
From Daniel J. Bernier, representing the 
Central Maine Apartment Owners Association 
Re: LD 347 An Act Regarding In-court Appearance Requirements for Persons Authorized to 
Serve Eviction Notices and the Process for Serving a Writ of Possession 
I represent the Central Maine Apartment Owners Association which is joined by the 
Rental Housing Alliance of Southem Maine in support of LD 347. 
To make it easier to understand what the bill does I have attached copies of the various 
documents that are served in the process of an eviction hearing. The ﬁrst two (2) documents are 
a 7-day notice of eviction and a 30-day notice of eviction. These are actual notices where we 
have redacted the names and address. You can see where the sheriff’s deputy has served them. 
A residential eviction proceeding is begun by serving a tenant with either a 7-day notice of 
eviction or a 30-day notice of eviction. The legislature has created a list of reasons wherea 
landlord mayevict using a 7-day notice. If the reason is other then something that is on that list, 
then the landlord needs to use a 30-day notice or longer. On the 7-day notice that I have given 
you, a deputy checked off that he served it in hand. A 7-day or a 30-day eviction notice may be 
served by either a sheriff’s deputy, a constable, the landlord or the landlord ’s property manager. 
In serving it on the tenant, they either need to serve the tenant in hand, they can give it to 
someone who is of suitable age and discretion who is residing at the tenant’s usual residence, or 
they can make three (3) good faith attempts to serve it at the residence, then post it on the door 
and mail it ﬁrst class mail to the tenant. The form gives the deputy the option of checking off 
which of the three (3) methods that he used for service and then signing on that. Section 1 of 
LD 347, just says that if it is a sheriff’s deputy who serves the notice or a constable, their 
signature as to having it served is sufficient and they do not need to appear in Court to 
testify as to how they served the notice. On the other hand, if the landlord or the 
landlord ’s property manager serves the notice, they do have to be in Court and actually 
testify to the service of the notice. The practice of not requiring the sheriffs to show up to 
testify as to the service of the notice has been the practice for my entire thirty (30) years of 
practice and is still the practice followed in the Augusta, Waterville and Skowhegan Courts 
where I spend most of my time. In fact, it is my understanding it is the practice in virtually 
every Court in the State except for Lewiston. Apparently there have been some recent cases 
where Lewiston District Court has deviated from the traditional practice and required sheriffs

deputies to show up and testify as to service. I have heard different things, that it was a new 
Judge, it was an inexperienced lawyer representing the landlords. All LD 347 does in Section 1 
is codify what has been the actual practice in eviction hearings for at least the last thirty 
(30) years and probably much longer than that. 
The next two (2) documents I give you are a complaint and a summons. After a tenant is 
served with an eviction notice and the notice expires the tenant is served with a complaint anda 
summons which gives them the eviction hearing date and the address of the Court that they 
need to appear in. A complaint and a summons need to be served by a deputy sheriff ora 
constable. It cannot be served by a landlord or a landlord ’s property manager. All legal 
proceedings begin with a service of a stunmons. This one was served by posting. You will 
notice on the return of service on the third page, the deputy notes that he Went to the property to 
attempt in hand service on December 14, December 15 and December l9 and on his third 
attempt he posted it on the door and mailed it ﬁrst class mail to the tenant. A summons may be 
served either in hand, or with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the 
premises, or by three (3) good faith attempts on at least two (2) different days and then posting 
it and mailing it to the tenant. On a summons, it is agreed in all courts that sheriffs deputies do 
not have to show up and testify that they served the summons. We trust deputy’s signed 
statements that they served a summons, but not that they served a notice? That contradiction is 
one of the things that would be dealt with by LD 347. 
Most eviction hearings settle, to force deputies to wait around a court house on 
eviction days just in case a matter goes to hearing is a waste of money and law 
enforcement resources which achieves nothing. If we do not trust signed statements by 
our deputies, we have far bigger problems than evictions. I also try to get the landlords I 
represent to use deputies to serve their notices as then We know it is done right. The 
purpose of the notice is to give the tenant notice, not create technical legal problems. We 
should be encouraging landlords to use deputies, so we know service of the tenant is done 
right. 
The next document as you go through is an actual Judgment of a F orcible Entry and 
Detainer. This one said the judgment was entered by default which would mean the tenant did 
not show up to the hearing. If the tenant shows up and loses the hearing the Court will give 
them a copy of the judgment often that day, although some of the busier Courts will mail them 
the copy. If the tenant does not show up, the Court will mail them a copy of the Judgment. You 
will also notice that at the foot of the Judgment it says in bold letters “please note if judgment is 
granted to the Plaintiff the Writ of Possession shall issue seven calendar days after the 
judgment is entered” . If tenants show up, most Judges will also explain the process of issuing 
the Writ of Possession to the tenant. On this case, while it says the tenant was defaulted, the 
tenant was actually outside the court room before everyone was called into the court room. 
They had a conversation with a Pine Tree Legal lawyer, started swearing at the lawyer and then 
left. The Pine Tree Legal lawyer and I went into the court room and explained that the tenant 
had left, and the Judge granted the default. I think the disagreement between the Pine Tree 
lawyer and the tenant was because the tenant forgot to tell the lawyer they assaulted the 
landlord and ripped the doors off the building. The Pine Tree lawyer thought that was valuable 
information the tenant should have shared with him. I agree with the Pine Tree lawyer, and he 
acted very professionally. 
Page 2 of3 
I79 Main Street, Suite 304 * Watewille, Maine 04901 * t207.877.8969 * dan@bernierlawof ﬁce.com
The last document that I give you is the Writ of Possession. This is the ﬁnal document in 
the eviction proceedings. A landlord after wirming an eviction hearing can obtain a Writ of 
Possession seven (7) days after the hearing is over. They then need the sheriff’s deputy to serve 
the Writ of Possession. Forty-eight hours (48) after the Writ of Possession is served the 
sheriffs deputies will come and help the landlord remove the tenant if necessary. A Writ of 
Possession may only be served by a sheriff’ s deputy it may not be served by a constable. On 
this one the deputy went out on three (3) different days, January 17, January 18 and January 19 
posted it at 2:40 P.M. on January 19 and mailed it first class mail. The time of posting is 
signiﬁcant because it is forty-eight hours (48) after the posting that the tenant no longer has any 
rights to be on the premises. Often it happens that the tenants will not open the door when the 
sheriff’ s deputies come so they have to go out multiple times to post the writ. With the writ, the 
current law is that the sheriffs deputy has to go out on three (3) different days to try to attempt 
in hand service and then post it on the third day. 
The second section of LD 347 would change the law to say that when we get to the 
Writ of Possession the sheriffs deputy only has to go out once and if the tenant is not 
there may post it on the door and mail it to the tenant. If you have been keeping count 
through this process, the tenants under the current law may force ten trips by the deputy to the 
apartment: Three times and mailing on the notice, three times and mailing on summons, three 
times and mailing on the writ and then one time to remove the tenant. That gets expensive and 
causes delays. Plus, the tenant would have received a copy of the Judgment from the court. By 
the time we get to the Writ the tenant has plenty of notice of what is going on. Forcing a deputy 
sheriff to go out three different days to post the writ is expensive, wasteful, and really does not 
serve a valuable purpose other than delay. Any tenant knows What is going on at this point. 
Most Judges are very good about explaining the writ process at the hearing. By the time you get 
to the writ, the tenant has received a notice of eviction, a summons with a court date and there 
has been a court hearing where the tenant lost. 
p Over the years I have heard many stories from sheriff s deputies of tenants just looking at 
them out the Window and not opening the door forcing the sheriff‘ s deputies to go back 
multiple times to post documents. That is disrespectful to our law enforcement. 
Thank you for your time and consideration I urge your support for LD 347. 
Very truly yours, 
aniel Bern 1r
