LD 347
I would like to support LD 347.  I feel it would add an extra burden on those serving 
evictions to have to appear in court to testify.  We should have confidence that when a
sheriff serves the notice, that it is done correctly and the signed documents are 
sufficient proof of service and not require the sheriff to sit in the courthouse for hours 
waiting for the case to be heard.
