I’m writing in support of LD 347.  
This is good  common -sense  law to reduce the number  of wasteful  trips of sheriff’s  deputies to 
serve notices during the e viction process. It is absurd  that they  need to go to a p roperty up to 
10 times to serve the proper  notices during the eviction process. This is a waste of money and 
law enforcement resources.  
I agree with  the first section of LD 347 .  We need to be a ble to trust our law enforcement 
professionals  when they sign  that a n otice has been served . It is a waste of their time to force 
them to wait around the courthouse all day.  If law enforcement is l ying about  serving notices 
like this , we have even greater societ al problems th an the e viction process.  
I also support the second section of LD 347 which allows sheriff’s  deputies to only go out once 
to serve the Write of Possession. They sho uld be able to post the door  and mail  a cop y if the  
tenant is not there so the process is not delayed.  
I’d like to note that tenants  commonly refuse to come to the door when they know a  notice is 
being issue d. Just last month , I served a 7-day notice  due to no n-payment  as a property 
manager. The tenant s watched me knock on the door through  the window. I had to re turn to 
the property three more times  (each time people were inside)  to post the door and then mail 
the no tice. Tenants  also do this t o law enforcement. It is not o kay that we are wasting  law 
enforcement re sources . Please  support this bill.
