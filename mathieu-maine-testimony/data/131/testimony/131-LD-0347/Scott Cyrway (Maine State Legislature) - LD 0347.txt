three ood faith efforts on three different defendant's last and usual Place of abode. Current aw reqmresg 
days to serve the defendant. This is an inefficient use of our resources. To require a deputy sheriff to go 
out on three different days before they can post the writ of possession causes unnecessary delays, and 
tenants are well aware of the fact that they need to be vacating the apartment by the time you get to the 
writ of possession. 
Thank you for your time and considera Ô¨Åon.
