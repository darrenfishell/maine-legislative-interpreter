Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
I write in support of LD 347. 
I think this bill will streamline the eviction process in a way that frees up the valuable time of or our 
local law enforcement while maintaining tenants’ rights. 
My husband and I are property managers. When we went to serve our first eviction notice, the tenants 
watched us through their windows and did not answer their door. They knew that an eviction was 
imminent as we had already been in discussions with them regarding missed payments and that the 
consequence of non-payment would be eviction. This happened on all 3 occasions we tried to serve the 
notice.  In this scenario, the tenants were well aware of the situation. Having to serve notice 3 times did
not protect the tenants; rather it just protracted the process for both the landlord and the tenant. This is a
waste of time for all parties involved. Most landlords or property managers will warn tenants that an 
eviction may be imminent, as most landlords wish to avoid evictions.  
I trust the word of our local law enforcement when they write that a good faith effort has been made to 
serve notice. Wasting our local law enforcement’s time to appear to testify in court is also a waste of 
time and resources. 
I also support our law enforcement being able to post the door and mail the writ of possession if the 
tenant is not home or willing to come to the door to accept the legal notice.
Respectfully yours, 
Jamie Nickerson
