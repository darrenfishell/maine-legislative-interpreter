Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
Capital Area Housing Association
LD 347
February 16, 2023
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
We are testifying in support of LD 347.
My name is Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don. I am current President of Capital Area Housing 
Association, a landlord association in Augusta area. Currently we have 177 members 
and 44 (25%) of those members live in the same building, 35 of them (20%) own 1 
unit, 137 of them (77%) own 5 units or less. Most of our members like me have 
regular job or retired.  They mow the lawns, snow blow driveways, clean their 
properties, and do whatever property maintenance by themselves allowed by the law.
Most of evictions are due to none payment of rent. We are supporting this bill because it will 
help the eviction process. Why should we have to pay to have a sheriff at the court? It is a 
unnecessary expense.
 
We urge you to vote ought to Pass LD 347.
Thank you. 
Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
President, Capital area Housing Association                                                                       28
