Testimony of Rep. Anne Perry Introducing LD97 An Act to Repeal the Hospital 
and Health Care Provider Cooperation Act 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial 
Services 
LD 97 would repeal the Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA, 
which is an agreement that allows certain health care mergers or 
agreements to be exempted from certain Federal Trade Commission 
anti-trust oversight. While the COPA was established under the guise 
of increasing quality and decreasing cost, experience has borne out 
that this is not the effect. Further, there has been little utilization of 
this tool in Maine. l agreed to sponsor this bill on behalf of the 
Department of Health and Human Services because I share the 
concerns youâ€™ll hear laid out and agree that this tool is no longer an 
option beneficial to Mainepeople. 
I'll now hand it over to Director Bill Montejo of the Division of 
Licensing and Certification at DHHS to further introduce the bill and 
take your questions.
