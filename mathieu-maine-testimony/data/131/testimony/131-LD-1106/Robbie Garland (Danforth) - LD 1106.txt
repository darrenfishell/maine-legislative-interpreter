Testimony in Support of LD # 1106 An Act to Improve the Transition to Adult 
Services for Children with Intellectual Disabilities  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
My name is Robbie Garland and I live in Danforth. I am a self-advocate meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am part of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s Self-
Advocacy Network.  
 
I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1106 because no one should be left out 
of services.      
 
This bill is important to me so that transitioning youth can learn about any new service 
that they may not have heard about before.  This will help them learn about services 
early so they know what to expect.   
 
It hurts young people if they don’t know what to expect when they reach adulthood.  It is 
important they can learn about what other supports they can rely on in their future.   
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1106. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Robbie Garland
