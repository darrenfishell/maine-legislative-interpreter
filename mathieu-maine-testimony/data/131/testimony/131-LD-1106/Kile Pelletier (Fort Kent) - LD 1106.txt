Testimony in Support of LD # 1106 An Act to Improve the Transition to Adult 
Services for Children with Intellectual Disabilities  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
My name is Kile Pelletier and I live in Fort Kent. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability.  I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. 
 
I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1106 because youth need to know what 
services and supports are out there so that when they graduate and transition, they will 
know what they will be receiving when they graduate. 
 
When I was in high school, I had no idea what services were out there.  I got lost when I 
graduated and didn’t know what I was going to do in my life and basically going to Job 
Corps. I didn’t know what else was out there and if I didn’t go back, I would have been 
out on the streets without support. 
 
By educating the youth in high school they can think about the type of adult services 
that are out there.  When it comes to graduation, they will be able to choose what type 
of services they want, and they will know what their choices are. 
 
I am in support of this bill but would like to recommend that the language be changed 
from age 15 to age 14 to be in alignment with the Lifespan Waiver work. I have seen a 
lot of bills around transition age youth this year and know that the LD 924 Taskforce 
group had a lot of good recommendations for changing the system. I think it is important 
for this committee to look at many of these bills and the LD 924 Taskforce 
recommendations. The Lifespan Waiver proposed change will also solve some of these 
issues.  
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1106. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,
