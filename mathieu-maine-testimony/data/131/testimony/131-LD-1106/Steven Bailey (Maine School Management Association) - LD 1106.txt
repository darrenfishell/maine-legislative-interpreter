TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR N OR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1106 
 
AN ACT TO IMPROVE TH E TRANSITION TO ADULT SERVICES FOR  
CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer  and members of the Health and Hu man Services  Committee.  I am 
Steven B ailey , executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association , neither for nor against L.D. 1106. 
 
We support the concept but are concer ned with the language: School administrative units are required to 
assist the liaison team with providing transitional services.  
 
Without knowing what that means we can’t fully support. We question if it means the DHHS liaison team can 
determine the trans ition services for the students and then SAUs would be required to provide them. We know 
it says ‘assist’ but who provides the service when DHHS is short -staffed?  
 
Also, under IDEA, the IEP team is responsible for determining transition services for schoo l-age students, not 
DHHS.
