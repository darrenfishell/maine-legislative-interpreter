Testimony in Support of LD # 1106 An Act to Improve the Transition to Adult 
Services for Children with Intellectual Disabilities  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
 
My name is Regina Bowie and I live in Presque Isle. I am a self-advocate meaning I am 
a person who lives with a disability. I am part of Speaking Up For Us, Maineâ€™s Self-
Advocacy Network and am currently the Chair of the Board of Directors.    
I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1106 because every child deserves a 
chance to transition to adulthood and to be properly educated with the correct tools that 
work for them.   
 
This bill is important to me because all transitioning children need many more choices 
for the services that they need to transition into adulthood.   It is important for them to be 
prepared for many years to come.  This will not only educate the child but will also help 
educate the family about what to expect in adulthood.    
 
Individuals have the right to make their own choices without resistance from caregivers 
when it comes to preparing for their future.   Starting this at a younger age will help 
prepare them for their future.   
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1106. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Regina Bowie
