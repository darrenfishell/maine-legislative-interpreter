Testimony in Support of LD # 1106 An Act to Improve the Transition to Adult 
Services for Children with Intellectual Disabilities  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
My name is Jenna Deniger and I live in Cherryfield. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am 
a person who lives with a disability. I am part of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s Self-
Advocacy Network.  
 
I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1106 because I was once that person 
transitioning to adulthood that was put on the waiting list for my SSI. It is important for 
children who receive services to get the help that they need to succeed in adult life.  It’s 
important to start early because things take a long time to get started.   
 
I am 22 years old, and this bill is important to me because I was once that person 
transitioning to adulthood and put on a waiting list, and I was trying to get into college. I 
only had Trio, but I could have used a service to help me organize my homework and 
what I need to turn in, what I need to keep, and what I need to throw away. 
 
I’m hoping that it will help others so that they don’t have to wait so long to get the 
services when they turn 18.  Those waiting lists can take forever, like months to years. 
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1106. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,
