Testimony in Support of LD # 1106 An Act to Improve the Transition to Adult 
Services for Children with Intellectual Disabilities  
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maineâ€™s Self-Advocacy Network. 
 
I am in support of this bill but would like to recommend that the language be changed 
from age 15 to age 14 to be in alignment with the Lifespan work. I am serving on the 
Lifespan Waiver workgroup as a self-advocate and one thing I have seen is a lot of 
initiatives around transition age youth. I think it would be important for the committee to 
look at many of these bills and see if the Lifespan Waiver change will solve some of 
these issues.  
 
Youth need to know their options before they graduate from high school.   Even in 
middle school they need to start thinking about it before it is time.    
 
I ask you to vote in favor of LD 1106 with an amendment to make it age 14. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
