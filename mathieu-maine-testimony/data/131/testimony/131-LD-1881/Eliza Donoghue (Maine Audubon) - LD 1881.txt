Dear
Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1881,
An
Act
Regarding
Compensation
Fees
and
Related
Conservation
Ef forts
to
Protect
Soils
and
W ildlife
and
Fisheries
Habitat
from
Solar
and
W ind
Ener gy
Development
and
High-impact
Electric
T ransmission
Lines
Under
the
Site
Location
of
Development
Laws,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Maine
Audubon
is
a
strong
supporter
of
renewable
ener gy
development.
Rapid
deployment
of
new
renewable
ener gy
resources
is
critical
to
reducing
our
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
and
avoiding
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change—the
leading
threat
to
Maine’ s
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat,
the
conservation
of
which
is
central
to
Maine
Audubon’ s
mission.
At
the
same
time,
new
renewable
ener gy
development,
like
any
new
development,
if
not
thoughtfully
sited,
can
displace
wildlife
habitat
and
negatively
impact
Maine’ s
natural
resources,
including
agricultural
resources.
Policies
that
allow
for
the
rapid
deployment
of
renewable
ener gy
while
encouraging
projects
that
avoid,
minimize,
and/or
compensate
for
Maine’ s
finite
agricultural
and
critical
natural
resources
are
key
to
Maine’ s
current
and
future
agricultural
productivity ,
biodiversity ,
and
climate
resiliency .
W e
believe
that
this
bill
is
such
a
policy .
LD
1881
would
create
a
compensation
program
for
new
renewable
ener gy
development,
including
terrestrial
solar
and
wind
development
and
high
impact
electric
transmission
lines,
for
projects
that
impact
high
value
agricultural
lands
and
natural
resources.
Currently ,
the
Maine
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
(DEP)
has
the
authority
to
require
compensation
(in
the
form
of
conservation
ef forts)
to
mitigate
for
impacts
as
a
part
of
the
Site
Location
of
Development
Act
(“Site
Law”).
The
proposed
program
would
allow
permittees
to
pay
a

compensation
fee
instead
of
developing
on-site
mitigation
or
otherwise
permittee-led
conservation
projects.
This
option
would
create
flexibility
desired
by
the
regulated
community
and
allow
for
the
aggregation
of
funds
across
permits,
which
could
result
in
better
conservation
measures
overall.
Notably ,
the
DEP
does
not
have
the
ability
to
require
compensation
for
impacts
to
agricultural
resources.
The
bill
would
create
a
compensation
program
specifically
for
impacts
to
prime
agricultural
soils
and
soils
of
statewide
importance
within
T itle
7.
The
meat
of
these
policies
would
be
developed
in
rulemaking.
Specifically ,
the
statute
calls
for
defining
“prime
agricultural
soils”
and
“soils
of
statewide
importance”
and
“wildlife
and
fisheries
habitats”.
It
is
our
understanding
that
“wildlife
and
fisheries
habitats”
will
be
narrowly
defined
and
include
lar ge
forest
blocks
and
important
wildlife
corridors.
Maine
Audubon
supports
this
intention;
both
resources
are
critical
for
wildlife
adaptation
in
a
changing
climate
and
are
impacted
by
renewable
ener gy
infrastructure
given
project
size
and
shape.
Lar ge,
contiguous
forest
blocks
are
critically
important
for
a
number
of
forest-interior
species
that
require
lar ge
uninterrupted
woods
to
feed,
breed,
and
move.
Forest
loss
and
fragmentation
is
of
particular
concern
for
wildlife
species
that
require
mature,
closed-canopy
forest
cover ,
including
many
interior
forest
nesting
birds
like
the
black-throated
blue
warbler
and
the
ovenbird.
Fragmenting
impacts
are
not
limited
to
direct
habitat
loss;
the
impacts
of
the
fragmentation
can
reach
deep
into
the
forest,
af fecting
otherwise
intact,
neighboring
habitats.
This
is
often
referred
to
as
“edge
ef fects”.
Edge
ef fects
change
the
characteristics
of
the
forest
that
remains.
For
example,
light,
temperature,
hydrology ,
and
wind
speed
change
as
a
result
of
the
new
“edge”
that
results
from
forest
fragmentation
and
open-habitat
predators
or
competitors
to
interior
forest
species
can
access
and
unduly
impact
interior
forest
species
and
their
resources.
W ildlife
corridors
are
areas
that
are
particularly
important
travel
“lanes”
for
wildlife
to
move
between
habitat
blocks
and
are
often
important
habitats
in
and
of
themselves.
Corridors
can
include
waterways
and
their
shorelands
and
proximate
uplands,
as
well
as
smaller
forest
blocks
that
connect
lar ge
forest
blocks.
Maine
Audubon
looks
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
work
with
the
Departments
to
define
these
areas
in
a
way
that
is
predictable
and
that
focuses
on
the
“best
of
the
best”
of
these
resources,
so
as
to
not
unduly
impact
renewable
ener gy
development.
Maine
Audubon
is
similarly
enthused
by
the
opportunity
to
better
conserve
prime
soils
and
soils
of
statewide
importance.
Each
are
finite
resources
that
are
critical
to
a
thriving
Maine
agricultural
economy .
W e
are
confident
that
the
Departments
can
work
collaboratively
with
stakeholders
to
construct
a
program
that
conserves
these
resources,
while
maintaining
the
autonomy
of
farmers,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
rapidly
deploy
renewable
ener gy
infrastructure
at
scale.

Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
our
testimony .
W e
strongly
encourage
the
Committee
to
support
this
important
legislation.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
