Testimony on LD 1881 
An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and Related Conservation Efforts to Protect Soils and 
Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and Wind Energy Development and High-impact 
Electric Transmission Lines Under the Site Location of Development Laws 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry committee, my name IS Jeff Romano I appreciate this opportunity to provide 
testimony on behalf of Maine Coast Heritage Trust in support of LD 1881 
Maine Coast Heritage Trust conserves and stewards Maine's coastal lands and islands for their 
renowned scenic beauty, ecological value, outdoor recreational opportunities, and contribution 
to community well-being We provide statewide conservation leadership through our work with 
land trusts, coastal communities, and other partners Over the past five decades, we have 
conserved more than 185,000 acres in Maine 
LD 1881 is the product of a five-month series of meetings that began in November 2022 that 
included representatives from state agencies, conservation groups, and the solar energy 
industry The participants discussed potent|al impacts of renewable energy development on 
wildlife habitat and agricultural lands, examined requirements under current law to 
compensate for those impacts, and slowly pieced together the bill language that IS before the 
committee today 
Stakeholders met eight times between early November to late March Although there was not 
consensus on every section of the final bill, significant portions of LD 1881 reflect I 
recommendations made by all parties, including representatives from the solar industry MCHT 
IS especially supportive of the bill's proposed creation of a ”conservation fund" in Section 2 
Under the current law, the only process available to compensate for impacts to wildlife habitat 
can lead to less-than-ideal outcomes This new fund will provide a better path for developers to 
ensure compensation outcomes provide the public with appropriate conservation benefits 
Renewable energy siting decisions include multiple trade-offs, and it IS difficult to craft 
legislation to make all sides happy However, LD 1881 successfully balances the competing 
goals of renewable energy development, wildlife habitat protection, and agricultural land 
conservation By design, many of the bill's specific requirements will be determined through 
rulemaking after additional feedback from the various stakeholders Once fully implemented, 
LD 1881 will position Maine in a better place to support renewable energy in ways that are 
consistent with other important land use values
