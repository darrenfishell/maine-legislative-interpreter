DATE OF HEARING: May 10, 2023 
Good morning Senator lngwersen, Representative Plueker and members of the Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry Committee I am Jim Connolly, Resource Management Director 
speaking on behalf of the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, in support of L D 1881 
This bill requires developers of solar energy pfOjEC‘IIS to pay a compensation fee or pay for 
conservation efforts to mitigate adverse effects on prime agricultural SOIIS or soils of statewide 
importance and developers of solar energy developments, wind energy developments or high- 
impact electric transmission lines to pay a compensation fee to fund off-site habitat 
improvement or preservation projects to mitigate the adverse effects of a development on 
wildlife and fisheries habitats The Department of Environmental Protection IS directed to 
establish one or more compensation funds to carry out the projects or to authorize a public, 
quasi-public or municipal organization or a private, nonprofit organization to administer the 
funds A solar energy developer may offset the compensation fee for the protection of prime 
agricultural soils or soils of statewide importance for land for which the developer paida 
compensation fee to mitigate the adverse effects of a development on wildlife and fisheries 
habitats and may also opt in lieu of the compensation fee to conserve a comparable area of land
through a conservation easement or a purchase for fee ownership by a public, quasi-public or 
municipal organization or a private, nonproﬁt organization that ensures the land remains 
available for agricultural production This bill also directs the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry to adopt rules and deﬁne "prime agricultural soils“ and "soils of 
statewide importance" and the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt rules and 
deﬁne "wildife and fisheries habitats" subject to compensation fees or other conservation 
efforts 
Climate change is one of the most pen/asive threats facing Maine's wildlife, contributing to 
increased prevalence of parasites and diseases, the proliferation of invasive species, and habitat 
shifting and alteration Development of renewable energy infrastructure is an important part of 
our state's efforts to combat these issues, yet these projects must be well sited in order to 
prevent adverse impacts to our natural resources Our department works closely with 
Department of Environmental Protection and renewable energy developers to recommend 
steps to avoii and minimize negative impacts to fisheries and wildlife and their habitats, and to 
identify appropriate mitigation when necessary 
This bill creates a new option for developers of solar projects, wind energy projects, and high 
impact transmission lines to mitigate adverse impacts on wildlife and fisheries habitats by 
paying into a compensation fund lmportantly, this bill specifically includes ‘large undeveloped 
habitat blocks’ and ‘important wildlife corridors ’ as habitats that would be afforded 
consideration by the compensation fee program Fragmentation of these habitats by dispersed 
renewable energy development is of significant concern to our agency and we feel that 
avoidance, minimization, and where appropriate, mitigation of these impacts is critical to 
maintaining the abundant wildlife and fisheries populations that are so important to the fabric 
of our state 
We would suggest as has been done previously in similar situations, such as with Significant 
Wildlife Habftats under the Natural Resources Protection Act, in recognition of our department's 
expertise and statutory authority, we recommend a revision such the Department of 
Environmental Protection be directed to adopt rules for ”wildlife and fisheries habitats" as 
defined by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife IFW staff will also assist DEP staff 
with that rulemaking effort, as it is in the interest of both agencies 
In closing, we would also suggest that this Committee consider amending the bill to allowa 
small portion of the compensation fund to be used to hire contract staff within each respective 
agency to assist with implementation This has been a successful approach with other granting 
programs and would help ensure that this new program does not detract from our ability to 
provide current levels of staff support to review and provide recommendations to avoid and 
minimize impacts to wildlife and fisheries habitat by development projects 
I would be glad to answer any questions at this time or during the work session
