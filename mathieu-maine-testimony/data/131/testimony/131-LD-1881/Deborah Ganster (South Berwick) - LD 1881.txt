I would urge extreme caution when considering the use of agricultural land and forest 
for the placement of solar farms. A committee of diverse
and knowledgeable individuals should determine, in advance, where these 
developments are best sited, taking into consideration the environmental impacts and 
the impacts on communities. It should not be left to the "discretion"  of corporations, 
with their profit-motivated incentive, to decide where these projects "should" go.
We all know by now how this goes. Let's get wiser about who has really been behind 
the "shaping" of land use and policy for decades and take measures to not see that 
happen in Maine.
