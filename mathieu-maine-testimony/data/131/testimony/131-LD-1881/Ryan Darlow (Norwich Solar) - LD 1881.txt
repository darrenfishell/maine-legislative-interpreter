LD 1881
The proposed legislation, LD 1881, will inhibit Maine's ability to meet its renewable 
energy commitments and reduce the benefits that Maine ratepayers can earn through 
the installation and operation of local renewable energy.   Additionally,  LD1881  will
significantly inhibit or eliminate up to nearly 6000 local Maine job years in the next 
four years according to a 2022 forecast from economists Ryan Wallace, PhD, and 
Michael LeVert of Stepwise Data Research. 
Furthermore, the Department's definition and maps of prime agricultural soils and 
soils of statewide importance are exceedingly broad and outdated. The Department 
currently does not have a soil scientist on staff and lacks the expertise to determine 
which projects are truly located on prime agricultural soils. The requirements 
contemplated in LD 1881 would put an unnecessary burden on many projects that are 
not truly located on prime agricultural soils.  References to these maps which will 
unnecessarily impede the growth of Maine's renewable energy economy. For these 
reasons, we strongly urge that this proposed draft LD 1881 should not advance out of 
committee. 
Thank you,
