Quality agricultural land is like money in the bank. It is valuable whether or not we 
currently need to grow food on it. Letâ€™s keep it available! Prevent infrastucture (such 
as solar panels) from blocking our access to good soil. 
Charging mitigation fees during the permitting process is one way to slow the 
development of solar panels atop prime agricultural land. Another way is to 
incentivize solar panels being placed on top of toxic waste dumps (that are not good 
for anything else).
The goal is to protect valuable agricultural land. Thank you!
