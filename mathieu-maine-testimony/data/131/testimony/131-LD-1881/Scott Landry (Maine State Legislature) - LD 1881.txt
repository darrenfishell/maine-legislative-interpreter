Testimony of Rep. Scott Landry presenting 
LD 1881, An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and Related Conservation 
Efforts to Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and 
Wind Energy Development and High-impact Electric Transmission Lines 
Under the Site Location of Development Laws 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
Good moming, Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and honorable members of the 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Connnittee I am Representative Scott Landry, andI 
represent the towns of Chesterville and Farmington in House District 75 Thank you for the 
opportunity to present LD 18811 
This bill has been a long time in the making David Trahan of the Sportsman ’s Alliance of 
Maine, Jeff Romano of the Maine Coast Hentage Trust and I began discussing this idea more 
than a year ago, and since then, a broad group of stakeholders have Worked closely together to 
draft the proposal before you today, meeting eight times between last fall and this spring In 
addition to the Sportsman ’s Alliance, those stakeholders included The Nature Conservancy, 
Maine Audubon, Maine Coast Hentage Trust, Maine Farmland Trust, the Departments of 
Envirornnental Protection, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry, the Govemor’s Energy Ofﬁce, the Maine Renewable Energy Association, Longroad 
Energy, Walden Renewables, Dirigo Solar, Verrill Dana, and Haley Ward Inc 
LD 1881 seeks to balance renewable energy development with protecting some of our state’s 
most valuable assets our agricultural lands and our ﬁsh and wildlife habitat Across the state, we 
are increasingly seemg large solar and other energy developments on farmland, including in my 
hometown of Farmington This bill doesn’t stop a landowner or developer from moving forward 
with these types of pro] ects Instead, it builds conservation into the process so that we can 
achieve multiple goals at the same time 
LD 1 881 
District 75 Cliesterville and Faimnigton
LD 1881 requ1res developers of large-scale solar projects on valuable agr1cultural land to 
mltlgate adverse effects of the project It prov1des the developer the optron of ﬁndlng an 
approprrate tract of land to conserve or to pay a fee to the fund that w1ll be responsrble for 
acqulnng a tract of land to be conserved 
The b1ll also requ1res developers of large-scale solar, w1nd and transm1ss1on hne projects to paya 
compensat1on fee 1n order to fund ﬁsh and wrldhfe habltat lmprovement and preservatlon 
projects These fees would be calculated based on the falr market value of the land bemg 
developed, plus reasonable costs of m1t1gat1on projects, w1th opportunltres to reduce the amount 
by lmplementlng m1t1gat1on strategles l1ke dual-use solar and agncultural productlon 
Based on mput from the agenc1es 1n support of the measure, I would ask the commrttee to 
COI1S1d6I' several amendments 
F1rst, I would suggest allow1ng a small portlon of the compensat1on fund to be used to h1re 
contract staff w1th1n the respectrve agenc1es to assrst w1th lmplementatron that could be tarlored 
to meet each agency’s unlque needs Thls has been a successful approach wrth other grant1ng 
programs w1th1n state agenc1es and would help ensure that th1s new program does not detract 
from the agenc1es ’ ab1l1ty to provlde current levels of staff support for the work they are already 
domg 
Second, we belleve 1t would be better to requ1re the developer to pay the fee pr1or to constructron 
rather than prlor to lssuance of a permrt The way the b1ll 1s currently drafted could be rlsky for 
appl1cants because, 1f the permlt were not granted, they would have already provlded 
conservatlon Havmg the payment of the compensat1on fee pnor to constructron seems l1kea 
better approach 
I am happy to work w1th the commrttee and stakeholders to prov1de an amendment to th1s effect 
for cons1derat1o11 at work sessron 
A number of the stakeholders who have worked on th1s proposal, lncludmg representatlves from 
the adm1n1strat1on, are here today to speak 1n more detarl to 1mplementat1on I encourage you to 
drrect techn1cal questlons to them, but I am happy to take any questrons you may have for me 
Thank you for your conslderatlon 
D1str1ct 75 Chestervllle and Farmmgton
