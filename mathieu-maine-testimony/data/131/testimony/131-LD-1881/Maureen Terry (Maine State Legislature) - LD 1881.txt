Testimony of Rep. Maureen T eriy in support of 
LD 1881, An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and Related Conservation Efforts to 
Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and Wind Energy Development 
and High-impact Electric Transmission Lines Under the Site Location of Development 
Laws 
Before the Joint Standing Commzttee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and esteemed members of the Agriculture and 
Conservation Committee I am Maureen Terry, representing part of Gorham in House District 
108 I am happy to be here to speak in support of LD 1881, An Act Regarding Compensation 
Fees and Related Conservation Efforts to Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat 
from Solar and Wind Energy Development and High-impact Electric Transmission Lines 
Under the Site Location of Development Laws. 
We can all agree that we need to develop altemative sources of energy if we want our planet to 
continue to be healthy and habitable for years to come But like with any new industry or 
development pro] ect, that work should be done thoughtfully 
LD 1881 seeks to create a new regulatory structure for renewable energy generation pro] ects, 
including wind and solar as well as ;transmission lines At the heart of tlns bill, as I understand it, 
1S a desire to meet our climate goals by shifting to renewable energy without compromising the 
integrity of our natural lands This bill would do that by charging an upfront mitigation fee to 
clean energy developers to help offset any potential impacts that the p1‘0_]6ClIS may have on the 
local soil, wildlife and ﬁsheries 
Not only does this bill help compensate for the negative impacts of large solar and wmd energy 
projects and high impact transmission lines, it also provides developers with predictability and 
District 108 Gorham (part)
cons1stency Addmg th1s cost up front means that developers won’t have to be surpnsed at the 
end of the pro] ect wrth hldden fees or last m1nute 1mpact evaluatlons Tlns ensures that they can 
properly plan and budget for thelr pI'0_]CC1IS, wh1ch 1s not only more attract1ve, but ultlmately 
better for a successful development 
By rmplementmg th1s strategy, 1t ensures that pr1vate-publlc partnershlps have the space to do 
what they do best Developers know what they can expect to have to pay, and the pubhc can 
count on those dollars commg through to help protect the fraglle b1od1vers1ty of local so1ls, 
w1ldl1fe, wetlands and ﬁsherles 
I’d l1ke to add that th1s b1ll would not take away farmers’ r1 ghts to lease the1r land to developers 
for renewable energy p1‘0_]CC'[S Il;_]11St glves greater clanty to developers and landowners about 
what nnplementatlon w1ll look l1ke It removes uncertamty, g1v1ng everyone the 1nfo1mat1on they 
need to make the most lnformed dec1s1ons Tl1lS 1s good for our carbon footprmt, for the health 
and wellbemg of our natural resources and local b1od1vers1ty, for developers who w1ll know what 
to expect and for the farmers and landowners who w1ll st1ll be able to beneﬁt ﬁnanclally ﬁom 
these pl'0_]6C1lS 
Thank you for the opportumty to testrfy on th1s b1ll
