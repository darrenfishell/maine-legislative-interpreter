Robert Frost sa1d, “Good fences make good ne1ghbors ” It may be true for humans, 
but not 1f you are a wrld anlmal Across the globe, the negatrve lmpacts of 
development and fences on our W1ldl1fe are profound Accordrng to the Yale 
Envrronment research paper, 3/ 17/ 
2022, tltled Unnatural Barners How the Boom 1n Fences Is Harmlng Wlldlrfe, 
“Fences can create ecologlcal ‘no man’s land” where only a narrow range of spec1es 
and ecosystems can thrlve, and further states, ‘ecosystem collapse 1s lrkely to 
follow”’
A year and half ago, I approached Inland F1sher1es and W1ldl1fe and the 
Department of Envrromnental Protect1on W1th concerns around the 1mpacts of solar 
development on w1ldl1fe habltat Although we ran out of t1me last sess1on, the 
Sportsman ’s Alllance of Mame, Instltute for Leg1slat1ve Actlon mtroduced LD 
1881 and asked Rep Landry to sponsor 1t Thank you, Rep Landry 
Based on early d1scuss1ons w1th solar developers 1t was determlned a system that 
establlshed a m1t1gat1on process that was predlctable and fa1r for all developers was 
preferred to the status quo A coal1t1on of state agenc1es, envlromnental groups, 
conservatlon organ1zat1ons and renewable energy producers met many t1mes to 
develop a new m1t1gat1on process and the product of the1r work 1s what makes up 
LD 1881 It 1s now a coal1t1on b1ll 
Durmg the start of our dellberatlons, the focus of the b1ll was w1ldl1fe habltat 
1mpacts It has slnce been expanded to lnclude 1mpacts to farmland so1l, W1th 
much of the w1ldl1fe 1mpacts centered on lntact forestland 
I leamed recently that developers were concerned W1th the farmland so1ls 
component to the b1ll, and some mlght be opposlng 1t for that reason I have no 
b1as to the method used to determlne compensatlon requlrements related to 
agr1cultural land, but placmg solar pI‘0_]6C'[S on farmland does not _]LlS't 1mpact the 
so11s It also 1mpacts the w1ldl1fe 
It does not matter 1f you place a fence around a ﬁeld or a forest, you are creatlng a 
“no man’s land” where nothlng on legs and wlth no w1ngs can travel F1elds and 
farmland are part of the ecologlcal landscape An1mals that fear the llght travel at 
nlght F1elds that are qu1et 1n the day are w1ldl1fe ’s c1ty llfe 1n the nlght, 1t 1s the 
place deer graze, fox, bobcat, and coyote hunt 
Everyth1ng wlld, uses ﬁelds at one t1me or another To argue fencmg 1n a 50 or 
500-acre ﬁeld does not harm w1ldl1fe 1s to 1gnore the fact that an1mals usmg these 
areas must travel greater dlstances because of fences, they must ﬁnd new food 
sources, cross dangerous roads and srmply must l1ve 1n a smaller natural world 
Whatever th1s comm1ttee does W1th th1s b111, there 1s no mlstakmg the lmpact of 
fenced solar development on our w1ldl1fe on forested and non-forested landsI 
have no preference how th1s comm1ttee m1t1gates the lmpact of solar development 
on w1ldl1fe, but please do not underestlmate how valuable farmland 1s as w1ldl1fe 
habltat
If I sald to you, th1s COII11’I1ll166 could restore thousands of acres of prlme w1ldl1fe 
habltat and open ﬁelds 1n less than a year, you mlght challenge me, I would

Unnatural Barriers: How the Boom in Fences Is 
Harmmg Wrldlrfe 
From the US West to M ongolza, fences are gomg up rapzdly as border barrzers and lwestock 
farmmg mcrease Now, a growmg number of studzes are showmg the zmpact qf these fences, 
ﬁom zmpedmg wzldlzﬁ: mzgmttons to mcreasmg the genetu: zsolanon of threatened speczes 
BY JIM ROBBINS MARCH 17, 2022 
T he most famous fence 1n the Umted States 1s the expanded border wall pushed 
by former Presrdent Donald Trump Intended to prevent rllegal rmmlgratron, 
the barner also keeps wrldlrfe from movmg between the Umted States and Mexrco 
“The mam threat of the border wall 1s not the locahzecl area of habrtat loss and habrtat 
clegradatron, ” sard Aaron Flesch, a wrldhfe brologrst at the Un1vers1ty of Ar1zona, who 
has studred the Wall's lmpacts “It's the landscape-level rmpacts of curtarlrng or 
completely preclud1ng wrldhfe movement and ehrmnatmg landscape connectrvrty at 
large scales” 
Brghorn sheep or Jaguars, for example, are cut off from others of the1r k1nd on the 
opposrte s1de of the border That means that the genetrc xnteractron needed to keep 
small populatrons of Jaguars or ocelots healthy may be affected It also means b1ghorn 
sheep 1n Mex1co may not be able to mrgrate north to escape a hotter and drrer chmate
These are the kinds of impacts caused by the many millions of miles of barriers 
around the globe that slice and dice the natural world It's a rapidly growing problem, 
with fence P1'O_]6CtS expanding worldwide In Europe, nations are building new fences 
to keep migrants from illegally crossing borders in isolated areas In East Africa, 
livestock fencing is interrupting the migrations of the region's storied wildlife A new 
fence between Mongolia and China has blocked the movement of gazelles And the 
list goes on 
Until recently, the study of fences and their role in conservation biology has been 
scattershot Half of the studies were done 1I1_|1.1St ﬁve countries, with many focused on 
the effects on medium-sized animals And fences still are not part of the Human 
Footprint Index, a database of human changes to the earth used by researchers to 
measure the cumulative impact of human development 
“Taking fences into account gives a better 
understanding of the cumulative effects of 
development on the landscape. ” 
But that is changing Several years ago, biologists in the Northern Rockies published a 
paper titled “A fence runs through it A call for greater attention to the influence of 
fences on wildlife and ecosystems ” In 2020, a meta~analysis in Bz0Sczence looked at all 
the studies of the effects of fences and found that their profound impacts are often 
ignored or greatly underestimated 
Recent research shows that these impacts extend far beyond blocking animal 
migration routes and include furthering disease transmission by concentrating 
animals, altering the hunting practices of predators, and impeding access to key areas 
of water and forage Fences may also prevent “genetic rescue" if an isolated population 
is decimated by disease or a natural disaster

fences “the wires that shape the world ” She and others liken 
the “aha moment” of the growing realization of the importance of fences to the 
evolution of the sub-discipline of road ecology The impacts of roads on ecosystems— 
most notably how they open up previously undisturbed areas to exploitation — were 
once similarly ignored But when the effects of roads on the natural world were 
identiﬁed and named, it changed the way people perceived them and helped bring 
attention to how critical roads are in conservation planning 
The reason that conservation has been largely fence-blind, scientists say, is partlya 
matter of perception “Fences are everywhere, for as long as people can remember," 
said Xu “When you look at a landscape, you don’t see fences themselves, you see 
livestock roaming and wildlife crossing You don’t see the fence, because you're so 
used to it People take them for granted” delivered to your |nbox SignUp

Fences are also hard to see from above wrth satell1te and other types of aenal 
mappmg, essentral tools 1n modern conservatron “You can’t see the fence, but you can 
see shadows of fence posts and a d1st1nct d1fference of land cover type, and you have 
to make an assumptron of that's where a fence would be,” sa1d Andrew F J akes,a 
wrldhfe brologrst wrth the Srmthsoman Conservatron Brology Insutute and the lead 
author on the 2018 “fence runs through 1t” paper “It's not easy And then you don't 
know 1f 1t’s a four-strand barbed wrre fence or a woven WIIB fence 
“Thmgs are nght at the begmnmg stages of how we are golng to map fences Talung 
fences mto account creates a better understandmg of the cumulat1ve effects of 
development on the landscape Fence ecology affects not only wrldhfe, but ecosystem 
processes, and 1t has a wonderful mtersectron w1th people and commumtles There 1sa 
lot more to learn about the rmpacts of fencmg” 
The 2020 analysts found that fences affect ecosystems on every scale, from decreasmg 
1nsect abundance, because they grve sprders ample places to bulld then" webs, to 
rrnpedmg the long-drstance mrgratron of everythmg from wrldebeests to mule deer

Wrldlrfe face two categones of threats from fences, one drrect and one rndrrect For 
example, one of the key drrect threats to the greater sage grouse — a specres 1n steep

strands of barbed wrre Antelope m North Amerrca and guanaco 1n South Amerrca,

and changes m huntmg by predators Fences, for mstance, are sometrmes used by 
wolves to corral then" prey And a raprd expansron of the number of fences 1n w1ldl1fe-

'Ihe world's longest fence, and an Ol)_]6Ct lesson 1n how fences change the natural 
world, 1s the W1ld Dog Barr1er Fence, wh1ch stretches 3,488 m1les across the corner of 
southeast Austral1a Researchers say the mass1ve fence has created two “ecolog1cal 
un1verses ” on e1ther s1de of the w1re On the 1ns1de of the fence, where farmers trap, 
shoot, and po1son the d1ngoes that do manage to get through, 1t has caused a troph1c 
cascade The lack of dmgoes on that s1de of the fence has meant many more 
kangaroos, wh1ch has led to overgrazmg, so1l eros1on, the loss of so1l nutr1ents, and 
has even altered the geomorphology of sand dunes and stream flow Thls has reduced 
cover for the dusky hoppmg mouse, an 1mper1led sp ec1es, and made 1t far more
