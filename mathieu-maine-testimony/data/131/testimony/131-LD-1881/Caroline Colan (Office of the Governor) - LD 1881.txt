GOVERNOR'S ENERGY OFFICE 
May 10, 2023 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) My name is Caroline Colan, and I am the Legislative Liaison 
for the Governor's Energy Office (GEO) 
The GEO testifies neither for nor against L D 1881 
We welcome the opportunity to comment on this proposed legislation and appreciate our office's 
inclusion in the stakeholder discussions that occurred during its development The legislature has 
established important renewable energy requirements in law to combat climate change and reduce 
Maine's reliance on expensive, polluting, imported fossil fuels Specifically, our state's renewable 
portfolio standard (RPS) establishes the portion of electricity sold in the state that must be supplied by 
renewable energy resources In June 2019, Governor Mills signed legislation that increased Maine's 
renewable portfolio standard (RPS) to 80% by 2030 and set a goal of 100% by 2050 1 
Recognizing the 
impact our regional overreliance on fossil fuels, including our highest in the nation reliance on OII to heat 
our homes, as well as the impact that volatility in global natural gas markets has had on electricity prices 
in recent years, Governor Mills announced earlier this year that Maine WIII seek to reach our 100% goal 
by 2040 Meeting these renewable energy requirements involves increasing the amount of renewable 
energy available for Maine, not only to meet incremental new load as we electrify, but to displace 
carbon-emitting resources that currently dominate the regional electricity supply 
As required by law, our office has assessed the state's renewable energy goals and options for how to 
meet them over the next decade Based on existing resources and a continued robust pace of new 
renewable energy deployment, Maine is on track to meet our 2030 requirement However, we WIII 
continue to need additional new resources to meet increasing goals thereafter as well as to meet our 
emissions reduction requirements and continue to grow a robust clean energy economy2

The GEO IS keenly aware of several factors that must be considered and balanced as we develop policy 
to facilitate the achievement of our renewable energy goals, including impacts to ratepayers, keeping 
pace with load growth as electrification increases, and the protection of Maine's abundant natural 
resources To ensure responsible siting of solar energy on agricultural lands as recommended by Maine 
Won't Wait, the GEO and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) 
convened an Agricultural Solar Stakeholder Group to make policy recommendations to balance the need 
to protect Maine's current and future farmland against the need to develop sources of renewable solar 
energy The ﬁnal report of the Agricultural Solar Stakeholder Group was released on January 20, 2022 
Based on its research and discussions, and additional input received from the public, the Stakeholder 
Group advanced seven consensus recommendations to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry (DACF) and the GEO The Stakeholder Group also developed relevant definitions anda 
matrix of siting considerations for practitioners Following the release of this report, the GEO has 
remained engaged in discussions with DACF and other state natural resource agencies on additional 
balancing efforts of renewable energy development and natural resource protection, some of which are 
put forward in L D 1881 
The GEO sees a potential beneﬁt to streamlining the process for mitigation of adverse impacts under the 
Site Location of Development law by providing an in-lieu fee option when mitigation is required which 
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) could use to efficiently conserve lands, rather than 
requiring a project developer to seek out suitable property and complete conservation work Sucha 
process has the potential to improve conservation outcomes and facilitate necessary renewable energy 
deployment 
It's the GEO’s understanding that there are several ongoing efforts with the objective to avoid, limit, or 
mitigate the impacts of renewable energy generation on agricultural lands or other important natural 
resources areas We would like to better understand the impacts of existing balancing efforts on natural 
resource preservation in Maine and the perceived need for additional protections For instance, Maine's 
existing solar decommissioning law requires projects of 3 acres or more to provide a decommissioning 
plan and financial assurance for decommissioning at the end of life The law includes additional 
requirements that provide for the restoration of agricultural land following the decommissioning of the 
solar equipment 
While the GEO appreciates the need for balance between renewable energy development and natural 
resource protection, we encourage the committee to avoid any language that may severely limit where 
a renewable energy project could be sited, or substantially increase the cost such projects would incur 
to be constructed - costs that ultimately would be borne by electricity customers, who are already 
overburdened by high prices driven by fossil fuels Leaving little room for any large-scale renewable 
development will constrain Maine's ability to meet our emissions reduction and clean energy goals The 
GEO believes more restrictive treatment of renewable energy development relative to other types of 
development proposed to be sited on these parcels could be inconsistent with the state's established 
emissions reduction and renewable energy policies Additionally, it could limit the ability for farmland 
owners to access renewable development as a means for income diversification and stability for their 
farms in the long-term 
The GEO is committed to continued engagement on this legislation and hopes we can work to seek the 
right balance between important policy objectives without creating significant barriers to continued 
cost-effective renewable energy development in Maine 
Thank you for your consideration
