M. 
Testimony of Shelley Megquier, Policy and Research Director, Maine Farmland Trust, before 
the 131*“ Legislature's Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
May 10, 2023 
Good morning Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry My name IS Shelley Megquier and I am 
testifying today on behalf of Maine Farmland Trust (MFT) in support of the LD 1881 —An Act 
Regarding Compensation Fees and Related Conservation Efforts to Protect Soils and Wildlife and 
Fisheries Habitat from Solar and Wind Energy Development and High-impact Electric 
Transmission Lines Under the Site Location of Development Laws We highly appreciate 
Representative Landry's leadership in sponsoring this bill and the input from a broad range of 
stakeholders that helped shape the bill's content 
MFT is a member-powered statewide organization that works to protect farmland, support farmers, 
and advance the future of farming Since our founding in 1999, MFT has helped to permanently 
protect more than 330 farms and keep nearly 60,000 acres of farmland in farming Our Farm 
Network includes over 500 farms and, in 2022, 2,250+ individuals demonstrated their commitment 
to the future of Maine agriculture through an MFT membership ln 2022 alone, MFT supported 48 
farm businesses with workshops, technical assistance, and grants — delivering over 680 hours of 
technical assistance and $309,000 in business and seed grants to help businesses grow their 
profitability Our main program areas are Farmland Protection, Farmland Access, Stewardship, Farm 
Business Planning, PFAS Support, Climate Resilience, and Policy and Research 
Protecting farmland in Maine IS a principal part of our mission because we believe it IS essential for 
ensuring that we have the land base to grow our agricultural economy, particularly as more farmers 
reach retirement age and development pressures increase across the state Maine's farmland ISa 
precious and limited resource According to the last USDA Census of Agriculture report, between 
2012 and 2017 Maine lost 10% of its farmland — that is over 145,000 acres of pastureland, cropland, 
and woodland 1 
This loss of farmland IS troubling because farms provide many critical ecological, 
economic, and community benefits Protecting Maine's farmland, particularly its high-value 
farmland, is necessary to ensure we have enough land to grow our food in the future and that those 
who want to contribute to feeding our communities are able to access the land they need in order 
to do so 
LD 1881 proposes changes to the permitting process for new solar installations in an effort to 
establish a stronger balance between supporting solar development in Maine and ensuring that it 
does not result in the loss of important natural resources, including agricultural lands The bill pays 
special consideration to prime agricultural soils and soils of statewide importance which are most

ln 2012, Maine had 1,454,104 acres in farmland, but by 2017 that number had dropped to 1,307,566 acres — a loss of 146,491 acres or 10% of 
Maine's farmland United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), U S Census of Agriculture for

advances the goal of balanced solar sutung by deterrung renewable energy development on Ma|ne's 
prume farmland souls and souls of statewude umportance by requurung developers to pay a mutugatuon 
fee uf development does occur on those lands Revenue generated through thus effort would be 
used to support farmland protectuon efforts In addutuon, the bull requures developers of solar energy 
developments, wund energy developments or h|gh-|mpact electruc transmussuon lunes to pay for 
conservatuon efforts or a compensatuon fee to fund off-s|te habutat umprovement or preservatuon 
pI'Oj8CtS to alleviate the adverse effects of a development on wuldlufe and fusherues habutats 
It us umportant to note that thus bull wull not unfrunge on farmers’ abuluty to unstall solar on theur land 
but rather helps to ensure that Mame adds a layer of protectuon for uts most valuable agrucultural 
souls wh|ch are crutucal to supportung a robust local and reguonal food system - now and un the 
future MFT supports renewable energy productuon on farmland and on actuve farms as long as ut 
does not sugnufucantly dumunush the potentual for agrucultural productuon On-sute energy productuon 
can provude economuc support to a farm, reduce the farm's energy costs, and us umportant for 
addressung clumate change 
Some stakeholders unvolved un craftung the language that us now LD 1881 have shared that prume 
agrucultural souls and souls of statewude umportance are not well-defuned enough to be used lI'Ia 
regulatory fashuong Certaunly, any natuonal data needs ground-truthung and the same us true of the 
natuonal data on prume agrucultural souls and souls of statewude umportance In response to concerns 
raused, LD 1881 durects the Department of Agruculture, Conservatuon and Forestry, un consultatuon 
wuth the Department of Envuronmental Protectuon, the Department of Inland Fusherues and Wuldlufe 
and the Governor's Energy Offuce, to unutuate rulemakung to establush the compensatuon fee program 
unclusuve of defunung prume agrucultural souls and souls of statewude umportance and establushung 
varuable compensatuon amounts based on the value of the habutats and agrucultural souls affected 
and the degree of adverse effect caused by the development We are confudent un the abuluty of the 
Departments named un the bull to unutuate and complete rulemakung that wull unclude fune-tuned 
defunutuons as well as the establushment of compensatuon amounts that are faur and preductable— 
protectung Ma|ne's natural resources and allowung developers to be able to preduct and plan ahead 
for any needed mutugatuon when sutung renewable energy pI'0]8CtS 
LD 1881 helps to ensure that expandung solar development un Maune does not result un the loss of 
umportant natural resources uncludung agrucultural lands that are the most conducuve to growung 
crops and rausung luvestock For these reasons, MFT hopes that you wull support LD 1881 and ensure 
that renewable energy generatuon and agruculture co-exust un Maune un a mutually benefucual 
manner 
Thank you for the opportunuty to testufy un support of LD 1881 I'd be happy to answer any
