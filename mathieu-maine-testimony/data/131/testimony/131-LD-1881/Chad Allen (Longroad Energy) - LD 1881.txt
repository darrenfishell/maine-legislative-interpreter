Re Testimony Neither for Nor Agamst L D. 1881, ”An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and 
Related Conservation Efforts to Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and 
Wind Energy Development and High-impact Electric Transmission Lines Under the Site 
Location of Development Laws" 
Dear Sen lngwersen, Rep Pluecker, and members of the ACF Committee 
On behalf of Longroad Energy (Longroad), I am writing to offer testimony neither for nor 
agamst L D 1881, "An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and Related Conservation Efforts to 
Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and Wind Energy Development and 
High-impact Electric Transmission Lines Under the Site Location of Development Laws" 
Longroad particlpated in discussions with other interested p8l"El€S in the process leading up to 
development of L D 1881, and we appreciate the dialogue that occurred at that time 
Longroad develops and operates wind and solar energy projects in markets across the United 
States In Maine, we employ a dozen people including Maine Maritime Academy graduates and 
U S military veterans who operate hundreds of renewable energy power plants across the 
country from our Scarborough office The Longroad team has been developing renewable 
energy projects in Maine for over 15 years, and durmg that time, we have invested overa 
billion dollars in developing approximately 700 megawatts of clean energy here in the state 
Longroad is supportive of aspects of L D 1881, but also has concerns about certain provlsnons 
Section 2 of L D 1881 would create an option for an in-lieu fee payment to offset impacts to 
wildlife and ﬁsheries habitat that are regulated under the Site Law Longroad supports this 
proposal and believe it represents a wln-win for the environment and the regulated 
community Currently, If a project requires off-site preservatron or habitat improvement to 
mitigate for project impacts, the developer must find and secure land that satisfies a rangeof

ecological criteria established ad hoc by the review agencies during the review process There 
are no established criteria for, or is no coordinated process among, developers to ensure 
conservation of priority lands that contribute to well-connected and important habitats 
Instead, every developer engages in one-off mitigation that may, but does not necessarily, fit 
within broader statewide conservation priorities Moreover, once conservation requirements 
are identified, typically late in permit review, it can be IS challenging for developers to find 
available and suitable land for conservation without causing a delay in schedule 
Allowing payment of a fee to a program administered by the State not only would provide 
flexibility to applicants, but ensure that mitigation funds, which are significant in amount, 
would be put to their highest and best public use The State is uniquely positioned to identify 
and acquire high priority conservation land and can do so as part of a broader set of goals 
Longroad believes that this would lead to better overall public conservation outcomes The 
State's experience with the in-lieu fee program for mitigating wetland impacts provides 
concrete evidence of the benefit of such a program and the resulting improved conservation 
outcomes We believe this could be a similar program that benefits the regulated community 
and the environment 
Longroad does not believe, however, that the option to pay a fee for mitigation should be 
limited to solar and wind projects and high—impact transmission lines Because it benefits 
developers and leads to better conservation outcomes, it would be appropriate for the option 
to be available to all projects regulated under the Site Law Accordingly, we recommend that 
the limitation be removed, and that the compensation fee program be available for all Site Law 
projects 
Section 3 would require rulemaking to establish the compensation fee program and to define 
the wildlife and fisheries habitat that are regulated under 38 M R S § 484-C Longroad agrees 
that the proposed rulemaking is necessary and appropriate to eliminate what has been an ad 
hoc process and provide greater clarity to the regulated community on the types of impacts 
that require mitigation and the criteria for determining resulting mitigation ratios The 
language in Section 3 that would require DEP to include “large undeveloped habitat blocks, 
important wildlife corridors and other habitat types identified in consultation with the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife," however, IS both unnecessary and inappropriate 
lt would essentlally predetermine the outcome of the rulemaking instead of allowing a robust 
stakeholder process to occur that would then inform the specific types of wildlife and fisheries 
habitat that should be regulated We understand that DEP believes those listed habitats are 
priorities and should be regulated as part of the rulemaking, and thus they almost certain to be 
part of the rulemaking But the key IS for it to be considered within the rulemaking and not

required by statute without the benefit of evidence, analysis, broad input, and detailed 
discussion To the extent the rulemakmg deﬁnes habitat and fisheries under the Site Law, it will 
be of general applicability and therefore it is particularly important not to preiudge what should 
or should not fall within that definition 
Finally, where, as here, DEP embarks on a significant new regulatory program, Longroad 
believes that the rulemakmg should be major substantive and not routine technical

that cost impacts from new mitigation requirements will negatively impact Maine ratepayers
