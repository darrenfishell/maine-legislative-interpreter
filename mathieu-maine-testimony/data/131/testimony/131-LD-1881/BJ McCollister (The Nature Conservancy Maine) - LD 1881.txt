RE: LD 1881 - An Act Regard|ng Compensatnon Fees and Related Conservat|on Efforts to 
Protect So|ls and W|ldl|fe and F|sher|es Hab|tat from Solar and W|nd Energy 
Development and H|gh-|mpact Electr|c Transm|ss|on L|nes Under the S|te Locat|on of

Senator Ingwersen, Representatlve Pluecker and members of the Jo1nt Standlng C0mm1ttee on 
Agrlculture, Conservatlon and Forestry, my name 1s BJ McColl1ster and today I am test1fy1ng on 
behalf of The Nature Conservancy I apprec1ate th1s opportumty to test1fy in Support of LD 
1881. 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) 1s a nonproﬁt conservatlon 0rgan1zat1on ded1cated to 
conservlng the lands and waters on wh1ch all l1fe depends Gu1ded by sclence, we create 
1nnovat1ve, on-the-ground solut1ons to our world’s toughest challenges so that nature and 
people can thrlve together Worklng 1n more than 70 countnes, we use a co1laborat1ve approach 
that engages local commumnes, govermnents, the pnvate sector, and other partners TNC has 
been leadlng conservat1on 1n Ma1ne for more than 60 years and manages approx1mately 300,000 
acres of conserved land across the state We also work w1th commumt1es to restore r1vers and 
streams, rebu1ld groundﬁsh populatlons 1n the Gulf of Ma1ne, and develop 1nnovat1ve solut1ons 
to chmate change 
LD 1881, the product of broad stakeholder engagement between the envlromnental commumty, 
renewable energy developers, and state agencles, ach1eves that end TNC supports procurements ‘ 
and 1ncent1ves for the gr1d-scale and d1str1buted renewable energy needed to meet Ma1ne’s and 
the reg1on’s chmate commltments We bel1eve that the rap1d deployment of add1t1onal renewable 
energy lnfrastructure can proceed concurrent to prudent and thoughtful s1t1ng pol1cy that 
preserves hlghly valued lands The DEP and DIFW have requlred compensatory m1t1gat10n for 
large pI‘O_]6C1IS 1n recent years (solar, w1nd and transm1ss1on), cod1fy1ng these requ1rements 1n 
statute would provlde more pred1ctab1l1ty for developers, support conservatlon efforts, and 
provlde a d1s1ncent1ve for s1t1ng pI‘O_]6CllS 1n certa1n areas of spec1al 1mportance to the natural 
amemtles that character1ze our beloved state 
The certalnty created by a compensat10n program w1ll create more pred1ctab1l1ty for renewable 
energy developers, at a cr1t1cal moment when Mame 1s hurrymg to catch up on 1ts cl1mate goals 
The strength of such a model 1s proven by the DEP’s In L1eu Fee Compensat1on Program, a 
voluntary compensatory program that allows ent1t1es 1mpact1ng natural resources, pr1mar1ly 
wetlands, to make d1rect payments to the Mame Natural Resource Conservatlon Program Tlns 
program 1s a cooperat1ve pI‘O_]6C't of the DEP and US Army Corps of Englneers, and 1s 
admlmstered by the TNC 1n Ma1ne It has a long track record of success that 1s mstruct1ve for 
concepts l1ke solar development 
We are support1ve of the Departments of Agr1culture, Conservat1on and Forestry and 
Env1romnental Protectlon hav1ng the authonty to proceed w1th rulemak1ng dehneatmg the 
speclﬁcs of the compensatlon fee, as well as the deﬁn1t1ons of “pr1me agr1cultural so11s” , “so1ls 
14 Mame St, Suite 401 Brunswlck, Mame 04011 gtgmgmg
of statewrde lnrportance ” , “and w1ldl1fe and ﬁsherles habrtats ” We also th1nk that the formula 
dec1ded on should allow for standard, on-the-ground ver1ﬁcat1on of so1l and land types to venfy 
the data that has mfonned m1t1gat1on components of a pI‘O_]6C’t up unt1l that po1nt Th1s bas1c due 
d1l1gence should serve to quell concems about the nature and quahty of avallable data 
Approachlng cr1t1cal renewables development from th1s perspectlve also rece1ves broad pubhc 
support A recent poll comm1ss1oned by The Nature Conservancy showed that 70% of Ma1ners 
support pol1cy requ1r1ng renewable energy developers to pay a fee to compensate for those 
lmpacts to h1gh1y-valued lands, and use the revenue to conserve, restore, or protect lands 1n 
Mame, wh1le only 24% oppose such a pohcy 
The Nature Conservancy fully supports the rapld deployment of renewable energy and we want 
to see 1t done well LD1 881 accomphshes that goal Thank you for the opportun1ty to comment
