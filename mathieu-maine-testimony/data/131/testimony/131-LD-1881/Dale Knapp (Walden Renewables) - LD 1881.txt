Senator Ingwersen, Representatrve Pluecker, and members of the Cornmrttee on Agrrculture, 
Conservat1on and Forestry M 
I am here today to speak 1n oppos1t1on to the language conta1ned 1n LD l 881 HP 1206, Chapter 15, 
Protectron of Agncultural Sorls from Solar Energy Developments I had l1m1ted partrcrpatron 1n 
the stakeholder group that developed th1s b1ll, so some of my testrmony others have heard before 
I am regrstered 1n Mame as a S011 Screntrst and L1censed S1te Evaluator and am Natronally 
Accred1ted as a Professronal Wetland Sc1ent1st, Certrﬁed Professronal 1n Eros1on and Sedrment 
Control, and a Certrﬁed Envrronmental Professronal I have spent more than 20 years as an 
envrronmental consultant workmg 1n the State of Mame I am here today to explam to you why 
th1s proposed change 1n law should be 1‘C_]€0'£6d Whlle others have and W111 share more reasons, 
my spec1ﬁcs are bulleted below 
0 The Natural Resources Conservat1on Serv1ce (NRCS) states EXPLICITLY 1n therr 
publrshed Use Lnnrtatrons that “Thrs data set (Farmland S011) 1s not desrgned for use asa 
pr1mary regulatory tool 1n penmttmg or srtmg decrsrons ” 
0 The NRCS data set does not necessanly portray land that 1s currently used for farmmg, 1t 
1dent1ﬁes potentrally productrve so1ls that may be stutable to be farmed, I1-I managed for 
that purpose The Farmland So1ls data does not rncorporate current land use changes Wl‘llCl1 
may affect the farmland so1l desrgnatron, nor srte specrﬁc cond1t1ons such as avarlable 
water capacrty or surface cover 
0 The NRCS also EXPLICITLY states that ground-mounted solar does not represent a 
permanent loss of farmland so1ls I have attached a memo here publrshed by the NRCS on 
th1s 1ssue (See Attached MAINE INSTRUCTION — 440-384) 
¢ It has been a longstandrng construct 1n S1te Law and the Natural Resources Protectron Act 
that 1n order to trrgger the need for compensatron, an evaluat1on would be performed to 
determ1ne 1f the proposed development would have an adverse 1mpact on the resource m 
quest1on Th1s assumptron that renewable energy w1ll have an adverse 1mpact on farmland 
so1ls 1s rncorrect The NRCS EXPLICITLY states that ma1nta1n1ng a vegetat1ve cover, no

I Many farms are located on land that 1s NOT rdentrﬁed as Farmland Sorls, th1s 1s a further 
demonstratron of why thrs proposed language 1s nddled w1th ﬂaws I have attached herea 
map of North Yarmouth, most of the farms 1n town are located on areas that are NOT 
ldentrﬁed m the NRCS data set, but some areas, such as gravel prts, are (see attached) 
What are the resources th1s brll rs trymg to protect, 1f 1t 1s Farmland, the language as 
proposed 1s deeply ﬂawed Further these sorls account for more than 40% of the land area 
1n most commumtres 
The NRCS deﬁnes these resources as follows 
> Pnme Farmland Sorls 
I So1ls that have the best comb1nat1on _ of physrcal and chemrcal 
character1st1cs for producrng food, feed, forage, ﬁber, and 011‘ 
seed crops, 
and are also avarlable for these uses (the land could be cropland, 
pastureland, rangeland, forestland, or other land, but not urban burlt-up land 
or water) It 1s expected to possess the so1l qual1ty, growrng season and 
morsture supply needed to econom1cally produce sustarned hrgh yrelds or 
crops when treated and managed, rncludrng water management, accordrng 
to acceptable farmmg practrces

I Sorls that fall to meet one or more of the requrrements of prrme faTmlan_cl,_ F ' ‘TT 
but are nnportant for the productron of food, feed, ﬁber, or forage crops 
They 1nclude so1ls that are nearly pnme farmland and that econornrcally 
produce hlgh yrelds of crops when treated and managed accordrng to 
acceptable farmrng methods 
I have personally contacted the NRCS Marne State S011 Screntrst, and they sa1d that they have had 
no rnteractron w1th the Marne Department of Envrronmental Protectron, the Department of 
Agnculture and Forestry, or any other stakeholders on th1s proposed rule change Thelr lack of 
rnvolvement as a partrcrpant 1n th1s process 1s a red ﬂag for me as a S011 Screntrst 
I strongly oppose the language presented as Chapter 15 and hope you abandon the proposal

MAINE INSTRUCTION - 440-384 - FARMLAND PROTECTION POLICY ACT (FPPA) - SOLAR 
INSTALLATIONS 
BACKG Round 
The purpose of the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) is to "minimize the extent to which federal 
programs contribute to the unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses” 
(7 U S C 4201 (b) section 1540 (bl) Policy for addressing FPPA activities resides in the Programs Manual 
440, Part 523 Specifics regarding what constitutes a permanent conversion from agricultural to non- 
agricultural use are not provided for all situations Solar installations are a common example, funded (in 
part) by various federal government entities These installations on agricultural land can be grazed, and 
also are usually ground anchored versus the use of the extensive concrete/paving 
PURPOSE 
This instruction establishes Maine's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) policy regarding 
funded solar power installations 
EXPLANATION 
Ground anchored solar installations are not considered to be irreversible conversions of farmland to 
non-agricultural uses by Maine NRCS 
CONTACT state soil scientist or assistant state conservationist for programs 
(Maine Instruction 440-384 -July 2022)
