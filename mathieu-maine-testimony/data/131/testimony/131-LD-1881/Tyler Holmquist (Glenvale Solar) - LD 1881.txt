RE: Testimony regarding LD 1881, “An Act Regarding Compensation Fees and Related 
Conservation Efforts to Protect Soils and Wildlife and Fisheries Habitat from Solar and 
Wind Energy Development and High—impact Electric Transmission Lines Under the Site 
Location of Development Laws” 
Dear Chairs lngwersen, Pluecker and Committee Members,
l 
On behalfofGlenvale LLC, we want to thank you for your continued leadership in Maine’s 
land conservation 
Glenvale develops large solar energy projects Five projects in Maine have Power Purchase 
Agreements from the Tranche i and 2 procurements These projects total approximately 
200 MW which IS equivalent to providing energy for about 37,000 homes The Projects are 
in Buxton, Baldwin, Hiram,Topsham,Warren and Turner Theywill provide $60M ofin- 
state and local benefits and about 200 construction jobs over the life ofthe projects With 
energy rates starting below $0 04/kwh, meaningful savings will be delivered to 
ratepayers The first projects to start construction will commence in 2024 
Glenvale is committed to supporting the growth ofthe clean energy economy in Maine and 
across the region However, Glenvale opposes LD 1881 for the following reasons 
1 The bill appears to apply to projects irrespective of project status Projects that 
have either received permits to construct or have awarded or executed energy 
contracts prior to the completion ofthe rulemaking process, would incur 
unanticipated costs, at a time of inflation and increased interest rates that could 
result in them being unfinanceable and subsequently cancelled This would forfeit 
the energy rate savings to Maine ratepayers
