On Behalf of the Maine Real Estate Managers Association 
In support of LD 1282 An Act to Streamline Income Verification Requests for Income Supplemental and 
Assistance programs 
April 19, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Health and Human Services Committee, my 
name is Bl McCollister, I am the President of the Resurgam Group and am testifying on behalf of the 
Maine Real Estate Managers Association (MREMA). 
Our organization is a nonprofit which represents over 80 professional property management companies 
providing affordable and subsidized housing throughout the state. It is within our mission to promote 
the availability of safe, decent affordable housing in Maine. Our management members are both for- 
profit and nonprofit landlords that believe in this mission. 
As property managers, an important step in housing those in need is to confirm they are income eligible 
for the funding program of the property they are applying to. At application, a household's income must 
be verified using a 3'“ party verifier. Property Managers are reliant on the response of 3"‘ party verifiers 
to house those in need, in this case income verified through the Department of Health and Human 
Services. lf a response in providing this verification is delayed beyond a reasonable window of time, 3-5 
business days for example, it can delay orjeopardize the housing for this household. 
In many cases an applicant is homeless, and a delay in response by DHHS means the household 
continues to be homeless. For those who have given a notice to their current landlord, this delay could 
force them into homelessness. For others, they could be rent burdened in their current housing and this 
delay continues that financial burden unnecessarily. 
We believe this bill will allow those in need of affordable housing receive the housing they need quicker 
and more efficiently. For that reason, MREMA supports the passage of LD 1282.
