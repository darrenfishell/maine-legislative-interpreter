207-324-5762  Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1282 An Act to 
Streamline Income Verification Requests for Income 
Supplementation and Assistance Programs  
 
April 19, 2023  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services , I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership and we support LD 1282 An 
Act to Streamline Income Verification Requests for Income Supplementation and Assistance Programs . 
 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people’s possibilities.  In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our W hole Family 
approach, we build a family’s capacity for sustained stability and economic growth.  We invest in the family’s well- being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success.  
 
For individuals and families who need  the support  our various S tate and 
Federal programs  provide, the stakes are high and the red tape is thi ck. 
People have nearly a full-time job just  to keep up with each programs ’ 
requirements. One must  reapply  for benefits  anywhere from monthly to 
at most annually, to several programs  and giving the same information 
each time.  
 
This bill speaks to the  data sharing relationship between housing 
authorities  and the Department of Health and Human Services  to 
facilitate housing support  programs , and I fully support that. We  should 
also consider that in some cases even agencies  within  the Department  
cannot talk to each other. It would be helpful to go  a step further and ask  
the State  to update the technology infrastructure to meet the needs of 
both the residents  the State serves and the State workforce.  The ability 
for State e mployees to only see the necessary client data to confirm or 
deny program  eligibility and that they do or do not have it –  top line 
information like name, town , last four digits of a social security number 
and boxes checked in the various  programs  - would be better for all 
concerned.  
 
We would  be servi ng Mainers better, and making our state employees ’ 
jobs easier, if we modernized our technological  infrastructure. The real 
need for privacy is trumping the imagined need to keep all records confidential . Presumptive eligibility  in more areas  would go a long way to 
thinning that unnecessary red tape , and where the rule or  law is already 
in place to allow for it,  as it is with many programs and between these 
entities,  we need our systems to talk to each other so we can let the  
eligibi lity work.  
 
Thank you so much for your time and attention.
