Remarks of Chris Emerson, General Manager, Coca Cola Bangor 
In Support of LD 1910 
May 15, 2023 
My Name is Chris Emerson and I live in Hampden I am the General Manager forthe Coca-Cola 
Bangor and Presque Isle Facilities I grew up in Maine and graduated from UMO in 2001 The 
members of our association — Coke Northeast, Pepsi Beverages Maine, Blue Triton/Poland Spring and 
Polar Beverages - are directly responsible for more than 1,600 good paying jObS in Maine with great 
benefits We are indirectly responsible for thousands more jObS and grocery stores, convenience 
stores and restaurants across the state 
Twenty years ago, our members were directed by the Legislature to form commingling groups This 
was done to reduce the number of sorts for redemption centers That took a lot of work on the part of 
local distributors — and still takes a lot of work Our commingling group hires an independent agency on 
an ongoing basis to collate the information about every container we sell and combines that information 
with the same information from our competitors The sales data and scrap must be tracked, accounted 
for, and adjusted every month And on a broader level, it IS unusual for us to partner with our market 
competitors 
The investment — both by our members and by the State - was a good one Commingling reduced the 
sorts that redemption centers have to perform for our products Our commingling group, for example, 
recovered 221 million containers last year Those containers can all be put in 11 sorts Commingling 
has also reduced the amount of truck traffic on Maine roads At least for the part of the bottle bill that 
consists of commingled brands, we have created a pretty good system 
The 15% of the system that is not commingled is the issue That small piece of the bottle bill is 
responsible for over 637 different sorts LD 1910 will address that It will establish a new cooperative 
that will apply to all containers so that they are all commingled Instead of sorting by brand, redemption 
centers will be able to sort by material That will dramatically reduce the amount of time redemption 
centers spend sorting all of the containers in the system 
We work closely with redemption centers in Maine They are our partners in making the bottle bill 
work If there are ways to make improvements to our overall collection system that can significantly 
lower labor costs for redemption centers without the Maine distributors and Maine consumers being 
impacted, those should be the first ideas we should try 
Thank you for the opportunity to share this testimony with you today
