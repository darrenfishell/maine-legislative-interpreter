Senator Brenner, Representat1ve Gramhch, and members of the Commlttee on Envlronment and Natural 
Resources, 
My name 1s Heather Sanborn and I am the co-owner w1th my husband of Rlsing T1de Brewlng Company 1n 
Portland We opened 1n 2010 and currently employ about 30 people We offer good wages, full health 
lnsurance beneﬁts, pald t1me-off, and short- and long-term d1sab1l1ty coverage for our staff. Our busmess 
1s extremely seasonal and our proﬁtablhty 1s entlrely dependent on the strength of our tourlst season and 
good weather on weekends 
I often hear from fnends that they have drlven by our patlo on a sunny Saturday and seen a crowd and 
assumed that we must be makmg tons of money. I ]U.SlI want to dlspel that myth a blt here today We 
operate on tnny marglns We're busy on-slte for ]I.1SlZ a few hours a week, though we're open 8 or 9 hoursa 
day, 7 days a week Part of the reason we have robust operat1ng hours 1s to provlde good-paylng full-tlme 
]obs to our cooks and servers, even 1f we're qulte slow durlng many of those hours 
The beer we sell at wholesale through our dlSlIl'll)l.1lI01" partners carrles an even thmner margm than our 
on-slte operatlons. And those marglns have been further squeezed 1n the last couple of years by the 
C()I‘lS0ll(l3lIl0I1 of Maine's d1str1but1on landscape, mcreased competltlon on the shelf, and an mcrease 1n 
the prlce of absolutely every mput mto the brewmg process smce the COVID supply chaln ClISI‘l.1plI10IlS. 
W1th the passage of a 36 cent per case mcrease 1n the handhng fee for our cans slgned 1nto law earller lZl‘llS 
month, those marglns been h1t yet agaln - ]I1S‘lZ as we enter the summer selllng season where we have to 
make all of the money that w1ll carry us through the long cold - and very slow — wlnter season 
We've worked really hard, partlcularly over the last three plus years smce COVID h1t We're stlll around, 
but we have yet to ﬁnd prof1tab1l1ty smce the COVID d1srupt1ons and the changes to our busmess model 
that those d1srupt1ons entalled I llstened as th1s commlttee heard from the redemptlon center owners 
last month I reahzed that the brewers had not taken our chance to tell our s1m1lar story 
As consumers grow concerned about 1nﬂat1on and a loommg recesslon, 1t's slmply not posslble for us to 
contlnue ralslng our shelf prlces If we do, our customers w1ll choose a less expenslve beverage 
alternatlve — dr1v1ng those consumers back to the blg natlonal brands that can operate on th1nner 
marglns and that do not create good paymg ]0bS for Malners. I urge thls commlttee not to heap any 
addltlonal costs onto Ma1ne's brewers so that we can contlnue to produce and sell our locally made 
product 
Wh1le I strongly support structural reform, I urge you not to take any further actlon that would mcrease 
the operatlng costs of the bottle b1ll for Ma1ne's small brewers
