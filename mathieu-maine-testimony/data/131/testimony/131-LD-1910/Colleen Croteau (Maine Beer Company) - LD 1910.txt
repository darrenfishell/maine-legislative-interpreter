Dear Commlttee Members, 
Just th1s mommg I recelved an emall from a small brewery 1n northem Mame lettmg me know they w1ll 
be closmg therr doors “ honestly we have never recovered from the pandemlc, and smce then have not 
been 1n a pos1t1on ﬁnanclally to grow our buslness to make 1t proﬁtable ” The owner told me 
Sadly, I’m afrald that the potentral ﬁnanc1al rmpact of the proposed bllls vv1ll cause other brewery 
members to go out of buslness I’m here today to testrfy 1n favor of LD 1910 and 1n opposrtron of LD 
1 909 
Mame craft brewenes are st1ll attemptmg to understand and absorb the ﬁnancral nnpact of the recent 
handlmg fee rncrease of one cent per contamer elfectlve May 5th and another 1/2 cent mcrease September 
lst ( LD 134 “An Act to Increase the Handlrng Fee for Beverage Contalners Relmbursed to Dealers and 
Redemptron Centers ”) 
To have our members face another Increase 1s potentlally dlsastrous and threatens the v1ab1l1ty and future 
growth potentlal of small Mame brewenes Those brewenes employ Mame people and also face nslng 
cost of wages, packagrng matenals, and ut1l1t1es, _]11St l1ke the redemptlon centers 
We are very much 1n favor of 1mprovmg the redemptron process and reduclng the amount of sorts needed 
We support creatmg a commmglmg group dedrcated to strea1nl1n1ng th1s process 
The unclarmed deposlts ﬁmd the p1Ckl1p process that 1s necessary for the system to work In fact, the 
amotmt that the drstnbutors collect only pays a port1on of the prckup and transport process 
What we cannot support 1s any further ﬁnanc1al rmpact to our members Brewenes who self-dlstnbute 
W111 bear the full cost of any merease to handlmg fees Brewenes who work w1th drstnbutron partners 
W111 see no ﬁnanclal gam, and mstead the cost of therr beer to the retaller and consumer W111 have to go 
up Any sort of escalator adds uncertamty and unpredlctablllty, and w1ll rmpact growth opporttmlty 
The gulld works trrelessly on mcreasmg the market share of local craft beer, and the ﬁnanclal lmpact of 
LD 1909 and LD 1910 severely threatens those efforts 
Thank you for your tune 
Smcerely, 
Colleen Croteau
