DELIVERING QUALIFY AND CHOICE 
ADVOCATING RESPONSIBILITY 
Good morning, Senator Brenner, Rep Gramlich and members ofthe Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources l'm Cheryl Timberlake, a resident of Mount Vernon On behalf of Maine's Beer Wine 
Distributors, I would like to offer testimony in support of LD 1910 and opposing LD 1909/ 
The Association is comprised of the family owned and operated businesses who distribute beer and 
wine as well as other non-alcoholic beverages to all the retail licenses in the state As exclusive 
distributors for beer and wine products, the businesses are obligated by law to initiate the deposit on 
their containers, to collect the empties from retailers and licensed redemption centers, and to further 
handle the returnable containers at their respective warehouses 
Let me begin by thanking both sponsors, Rep Crockett and Rep Hepler for their work on these bills 
MBWD appreciates the exchange of ideas While we were unable to reach consensus on all the policies 
presented in 1909, MBWD supports the reform measure to create efficiencies with the reduction of 
sorts by requiring all beverage initiators to be part of a commingling group This proposal will reduce the 
complexity and the cost of the system- 
In addition to the sorting reform, LD 1909 has an extensive list of additional programs and fees that will 
drive up the costs of the bottle bill program MBWD opposes all these fee increases, especially the 
removal of the unclaimed deposit from commingling groups 
As Distributors, we recognize that we play a pivotal role in ensuring the deposit law works It is 
imperative for this Committee to appreciate the financial resources that the Distributors invest in terms 
of labor, transportation, and warehouse space toward the success of Maine's Bottle Deposit Law The 
program is complex and costly for all parties, especially beverage entities, and the unclaimed deposits 
provide some financial relief 
The unclaimed deposits issue has a long history Let's start with the premise for the program 
Title 38 Chapter 33, 3101 states ”lt IS the intent of the Legislature to create incentives for the 
manufacturers, distributors, dealers and consumers of beverage containers to reuse or recycle beverage 
containers thereby removing the blight on the landscape caused by the disposal of these containers on 
the highways and lands of the State and reducing the increasing costs of litter collection and municipal 
solid waste disposal" 
In the 45 years of existence of the ”Bottle Bill" law there have been nearly 50 bills proposed to modify 
the program Major changes to the system are highlighted in the attachment to my testimony, they 
include regulatory oversight change from DOA to DEP and the collection of unclaimed deposits

On the tImeIIne sheet, you wIlI see that In 1991, 50% of the uncIaImed deposIts went to the state, w|th 
the remaInder to the dIstrIbutor who could apply to the state for reImbursement of up to 50% for over 
redempt|on In 1995 th|s provIsIon was repealed as too many out of state manufacturers were receIvIng 
checks for over redempt|on at the expense of the In-state dIstrIbutors 
In 2003 a new unclalmed provIsIon was estab|Ished as an IncentIve for the commlngllng groups The 
State d|rected local dIstrIbutors to form CommIngIIng groups and statutorIIy d|rected the unclaImed to 
those groups as an offset for the cost to establIsh them and to run the bottle bI|l 
The |mplementat|on of commlngllng In 2004 was a substantIve and successful change to the Bottle BIII 
that worked to create effIcIencIes and drIve out cost It's 2023, tIme to expand on th|s concept as 
deﬁned In LD 1910 
A path forward to stabIIIze and modernlze MaIne's Bottle BIII must Include a more effIcIent system In 
our vIew, that does not mean new defInItIons or pIIot pI’O_|EC'[S that are not focused on streamIInIng the 
system and controI|Ing costs 
As dIspIayed In the second attachment to my testImony, of the 10 bottle bIlI states, MaIne contInues to 
have the hIghest handIIng fees, prev|ously at 4 5 and now at 5 5 cents w|th the recent Increase MaIne 
also has the most comprehensIve and expensIve system In the country 
WhI|e effIcIency through cooperatlon has helped the beverage Industry In Oregon, the costs of operatIng 
an Integrated statewIde system are sIgnIfIcant To note, In Oregon there are no redempt|on centers or 
handIIng fees, and Oregon Beverage Recycllng CooperatIve (OBRC) uses all the unredeemed deposlts to 
fund the co—op operat|ons 
In MA, the deposIt system establIshes a level of effIcIency for transportat|on as the dIstrIbutors are 
pIckIng up empt|es from retaIIers to whom they sold beverages, and the redempt|on centers delIver the 
redeemed contamers they collect to the dIstrIbutor facIlItIes 
Today approxImately 85% of all contaIners sold In MaIne are Items that are belng managed bya 
commIngIIng group These groups take the unclaImed resources and Invest them In operatIng the 
system LD 1910 embraces these operat|ons and the expansIon of the processes to all beverages 
Thank you for the consIderatIon of our testImony and I would be happy to answer any questIons
