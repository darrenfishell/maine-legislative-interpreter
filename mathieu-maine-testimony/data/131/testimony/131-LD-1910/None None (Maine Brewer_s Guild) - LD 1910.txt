Dear Members of the Environmental and Natural Resources Committee, 
On behalf of the Maine Brewers’ Guild, the nonproﬁt trade association that represents Maine brewers, 
I am requesting this committee ’s support of LD 1910 - An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage 
Container Program 
As of 2020, our member breweries supported 2,400 j0bS in Maine Those breweries are struggling 
after the COVID pandemic to be able to handle all sorts of cost increases -- including sharp rises in 
the cost of wages, grain, packaging materials, electricity, and other utilities Weiust learned last week 
that they'll also be shouldermg a 36 cents per case increase in the handling fee for the bottle 
redemption program This will already result in an increase in cost directly to the consumer 
We cannot absorb the additional costs resulting from another handling fee increase as well as the 
CPI increases proposed in LD 1909 Our breweries that are under contract with a distributor can not 
survive the financial impact to our pricing model if the unclaimed bottle deposits, which currently help 
off-set but not cover our distributors ‘ costs in acting as our pick-up agent under the bottle bill, are 
clawed back by the legislature The financial detriment to our self-distributed members will be even 
larger 
We understand the concern of this committee for Maine's small redemption centers But we are also 
small Maine businesses who employ Mainers- almost half of us opening within the last five years 
Similarly, half of our membership produces less than 400 barrels of beer a year For comparison, 
Molson Coors produces around 2 6 million barrels a year We make a local product, often using 
locally grown ingredients, which supports Maine's agriculture industry Please do not lose sight of this 
when considering the fiscal elements of LD 1909 that would add costs that many of our breweries will 
not be able to shoulder This will cause closures especially in rural areas resulting in even further loss 
of manufacturing jObS 
The bottle redemption system needs structural reform We agree with and support the structural 
reform proposals in LD 1909 and LD 1910, but our mostly small community-based breweries would 
be crushed by the financial elements of LD 1909 as proposed We urge you to support the structural 
reform in LD 1910, without any further cost increases for brewers and consumers 
The Maine Brewers’ Guild will gladly work with this committee, and any other parties on discussions 
to address potential financial solutions after a reformed commingling Co-Op has been created We 
are grateful for your attention
