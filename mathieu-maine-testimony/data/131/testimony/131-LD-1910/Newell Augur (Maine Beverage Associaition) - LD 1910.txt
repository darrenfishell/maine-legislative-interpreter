Good mornIng, Senator Brenner, RepresentatIve Gramllch and members of the JoInt StandIng 
CommIttee on EnvIronment and Natural Resources, my name Is Newell Augur I am a resIdent 
of Yarmouth and a lawyer w|th PIerce Atwood I represent the members of the MaIne Beverage 
Assoc|at|on, your local dIstrIbutors of a varIety of refreshIng products IncludIng dIet soda, soda, 
julces, sports drInks and water I ah m ere to testlfy In support of LD 1910, An Act to An Act to 
End Manual Brand SortIng In the Beverage Contalner Program 
MakIng each dIstrIbutor IndIvIdually responslble for Its own contalners means that redemptIon 
centers must sort contaIners by brand That was the only way to do a bottle bIll 45 years ago, 
back when no one really knew about recyclIng and most MaIne munIcIpaIItIes had open burnmg 
dumps Today, It Is an outmoded method of collectlon As the bottle bIlI has expanded and as 
alternatIve routes to market have brought an extraordInary vast amount of dIfferent brands In the 
State, It has led to massIve IneffIcIencIes and sIgnIfIcant costs for redemptIon centers It has 
created an unnecess b ary car on footprInt because multIpIe fleets of trucks collect contaIners 
from the more than 300 redemptIon centers across our state 
When local dIstrIbutors created commIngIIng groups at the dIrectIon of thIs LegIsIature twenty 
years ago, that dId a lot to reduce the number of sorts Currently, about 85% of the contalners 
sold In Mame can be put Into jUS’[ 50 boxes But the remaInIng 15% must be sorted by IndIvIdual 
brand And accordmg to the DEP there are , as many as 637 dIfferent brands wIthIn that 15% 
that need to be sorted IndIvIdually That IS not a sustaInable model
LD 1910 proposes a new path fonivard lt would create a cooperative of commingling groups 
operated by Maine distributors that would eliminate manual soiting of containers by brand 
A new cooperative authorized in legislation and approved by the Department would usher ina 
new and streamlined process of sorting beverage containers by material type — glass, plastic or 
aluminum This would dramatically reduce the 637 sorts that a typical redemption center has to 
perform 
Our members would propose one amendment to this bill When it was drafted and submitted to 
the Revisor’s office, this Committee had not yet held a hearing on LD 134, President Jackson’s 
bill to raise the handling fee ‘A cent to 5 cents We drafted LD 1910 to include that increase, in 
recognition of concerns raised by President Jackson, Representative Hepler and others about 
redemption centers closing 
The Legislature recently increased the handling fee to 5 % That will inject an additional $85 
million into the system and will ensure that redemption centers continue to operate 
successfully The measure also includes another increase of % on September 1 of this year 
We would propose that the Committee delay that increase for no more than 5 months and give 
the local distributors an opportunity to set up a cooperative to end manual brand sorting lf we 
do that instead of increasing the handling fee another ‘/2, the new cooperative will significantly 
reduce labor costs for redemption centers and reduce overall costs in the system That’s a win 
for redemption centers, local distributors and, moreover, for Maine consumers 
If we can't do it — or the benefits aren’t worthwhile — then the additional % should go into effect 
We appreciate the work Representative Hepler has put into this issue and, most importantly, her 
willingness to meet with us and share ideas on how to improve the system Based on those 
meetings with local distributors, she has included most of the language from LD 1910 that would 
set up a cooperative of commingling groups into LD 1909 There IS solid agreement on 
reducing the gigantic amount of sorts 
Where the bills diverge, though, lS on cost LD 1909 includes several additional programs and 
fees that are going to drive up the costs of the bottle bill even further The technology fee of1 
cent — over and above the existing handling fee - is at best, counterintuitive lf the use of 
technology benefits the bottle bill, it should reduce overall costs, not increase them That is 
likely why there is no such existing fee in any other bottle bill Having distributors pay for bags 
was tried - briefly - more than three decades ago and was discontinued due to abuse 
Similarly, the removal of the unclaimed deposit from commingling groups will result in another 
cost increase and, worse, would mark the reversal of a prior promise made to the business 
community by this Legislature 
We are not opposed to the language in LD 1909 regarding a bag drop program (an attempt to 
define that model‘ s included in LD 1910), but have serious concerns about the language 
regarding account-based bulk processing When Hannaford implemented its Clynk redemption 
center business model years ago, the touted premise was that it had the ability to identify each 
and every container utilizing scanning technology that allows Hannaford/Clynk to reimburse its 
customer and bill the distributor The language in LD 1909 departs from that Additionally, the
proposed language does not recognize that at the end of the collection cycle, the scrap material 
belongs to the distributor The distributors must maintain ownership of the scrap — and the 
terms and conditions of how it is processed - in order to properly direct that material to recyclers 
so it can be made into new bottles and cans 
With the exception of 4 technical amendments, all of the statutory changes proposed in LD 1910 
are focused specifically on establishing the cooperative that will end manual brand sorting 
Reducing the massive number of sorts should be the Committee ’s focus Our system is more 
expensive than nearly every other jurisdiction that has a bottle bill We ought to be able to keep 
our environment clean and at the same time be respectful of the costs that Maine distributors 
and Maine consumers must pay LD 1910 lS the vehicle to do that 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify
