Testifying NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD1909 "An Act to Modermze Maine's Beverage Container Redemption 
Law" and LD1910 ”An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program" 
Chair Brenner, Chairman Gramlich, members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
My name is Mike Noel, and I am a Director of Public Affairs at TOMRA TOMRA is known for pioneering a range of 
technology and services for recycling and reuse systems, helping to reduce virgin resource extraction We have over 
50 years’ experience operating in more than 40 jUl'lSdlCtlOl ‘|S with container Deposit Return Systems (DRS or "bottle 
bills"), including all ten U S states with deposit laws 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on LD1909 "An Act to Modermze Maine's Beverage Container 
Redemption Law” and LD1910 "An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program" TOMRA IS 
commenting on an informational basis because, as a service provider to the beverage industry, retailers, redemption 
centers and the public, we have friends on both sides of bottle bill debates and ultimately, we have an interest in 
making sure any legislation results in a functioning deposit system 
Introduction to TOMRA 
In Maine, TOMRA helps about 60 retail and redemption center locations automate the container deposit 
redemption process with Reverse Vending technology to make container deposit redemption more cost and 
carbon efficient We also provide can and bottle pick-up and processing services on behalf of beverage 
distributors In deposit markets with refillable or reusable beverage containers, TOMRA Reverse Vending 
Machines are utilized to accept the containers and repay deposits ln addition, we provide state-of-the-art optical 
sorting technology Material Recycling Facilities (MRFs) use to improve the quality of recyclables handled by the 
curbside system, which will be integral to the success of the state's recently passed EPR for Packaging law We 
operate in over 80 jUl'ISdlCt|Ol'lS around the world

Our approach to vetting each bill 
Our goals when evaluating each bill IS to 
A) Ensure they solve the core "problem" which is consumer access to redemption and 8djUStll1g the redemption 
center cost structure to ensure redemption centers can remain open to the public 
B) Ensure any legislation preserves TOMRA's investments in Maine and our business lines 
C) Integrate best practices in Deposit Return System design so that Maine reaches high levels of recycling 
performance, convenience, and system integrity 
Comments on LD1909 “An Act to Modermze Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Law” 
1 Incentives or fundiing for Reverse Vending Machines will improve both the cost structure and greenhouse 
gas footprint of Maine's deposit system - Modern deposit systems proactively finance Reverse Vending 
Machines (RVMs) because they provide several beneficial services to multiple stakeholders 
a) Reduced labor costs — a redemption center handling about 8m containers a year could save over $90ka 
year’ 
b) Help redemption centers stay open since they are less exposed to labor shortages 
c) Reduces the cost and greenhouse gas emissions of container plC|(UQ - RVMs compact containers so PET 
bottles are reduced in size to a ratio of 2 5 1 and aluminum cans 6 1 This means far more containers 
can fit on each truck Less trucks means less traffic, less diesel fuel consumed, less cost to the beverage 
industry, and less greenhouse gas emissions If the top 40 manual redemption centers in Maine 
converted to compacting reverse vending technology, it would reduce 532 trucks trips, save 11,797 
gallons of diesel fuel, save about $100,000 in transportation costs, and save 120 metric tons of 
greenhouse gas emissions per year Compaction by RVMs would also help ensure pickup agents could 
reliably pick-up containers from more redemption centers, because more locations would be serviced 
with the same number of drivers 
d) More accurately count containers which ensures redemption centers are not missing revenue from 
undercounted containers — and makes sure distributors are only paying for containers that were 
actually redeemed For example, ifa redemption center handles 2m containers a year and ]USt 1% of 
those containers were undercounted - that means they are missing out on $2,200 in missed handling 
fee revenue and deposit repayments’ 
e) Reduces fraud — first, RVMs only accept containers that match the barcode provided by the beverage 
distributor Non-deposit items are not accepted They are also capable of preventing containers not 
sold in Maine if the distributor uses a state specific barcode as is the case in some high volume cities 
Second, RVMs compact the container which ‘cancels’ it out preventing a bad actor from attempting to 
redeem it twice Third, RVMs transmit real-time l'8d€lTlptl0I"i data so RVM administrators can monitor 
redemption behavior remotely and investigate potentially fraudulent concerns 
f) Reduces the number of sorts - RVMs automatically initiate billing to deposit initiators so a physical sort 
IS not necessary Containers are simply sorted by material type So, hundreds of sorts by distributor, 
material, type, size, brand or commingling group are not necessary

Examples of deposit systems investing in reverse vending technology include California, which last year 
invested around $70m in redemption technology, Quebec which invested S10m over 5 years into reverse 
vending machines, and Sweden and Norway which both offer a higher handling fee to redemption providers 
that utilize compacting RVMs 
LD1909 solves the commingling challenge without destroying a business 
We recognize and support that commingling can reduce the number of sorts in Maine and help redemption 
centers And we want to be part of the solution LD1909 is thoughtfully designed to maximize commingling, 
dramatically reducing the number of manual sorts while also recognizing the investments TOM RA has made 
over the years to keep Maine's deposit system running We have serious concerns if the 400+ distributors 
who we provide pick-up service for are forced to be managed by another entity, like a new Cooperative We 
have invested in identifying these companies, educating them on their legal responsibilities, and ensuring 
they are in compliance with Maine law 
Forcing these distributors to ]0ll'1 a new entity as LD1910 does would put our pickup business at serious risk 
and I do not think that is the intention of this reform effort — especially given our years of servicing the 
program While LD1909 could be improved, its approach to commingling gets it right 
Beyond our business concerns, there are legitimate reasons for non-commingled distributors forming a new 
commingling group to remain separate from the Co-op 
a) Most of the non-commingled distributors are small businesses - For example 
0 Stone Tree Farm & Cidery (Unity, ME) 
0 Outland Farm Brewery (Pittsfie|d, ME) 
0 Lake St George Brewing Company (Liberty, ME)\
\ 
ln 2022, Mainers redeemed less than 100 containers from each of these companies 
b) The cost of commingling these small volume producers is likely more per company than the other high 
volume commingling groups — that is because in order to accurately identify how many of each 
company's containers were redeemed after they have been commingled together in the same bag 
requires a labor-intensive auditing process Plant workers literally need to take bags offthe processing 
line, open them up and run them through industrial reverse vending machines to verify their barcode 
Since these are small volume producers, you have to audit a higher percentage of the bags that are 
collected — perhaps even 40-50% in order to identify any of their containers Commingling will also be 
conducted based on sales, but that is a very rough calculation based on market share Auditing bags is 
necessary to cross-check sales-based commingling and to ensure redemption centers are not committing 
fraud by redeeming non-deposit items This level of accuracy will be demanded by distributors (rightfully 
so) 
c) In LD1909, while the Co-op will be responsible for responsibilities like redemption rate reporting and 
product registration which carries some administrative costs — they will not be responsible for the cost of

managing the commingling of the 400+ distributors who are not commingled today and will end up in the 
SQ€Cl8| Commingling Group The Coop will not be responsible for educating these companies on their 
legal responsibilities and gaining their approval for commingling protocols and the regular sharing of sales 
data — nor will they be responsible for the labor intensive bag audits There is a reason this hasn't been 
done already lt's a pain to herd cats This is a mutually beneficial arrangement - small and unique 
producers are exempt from the additional costs of |0ll‘lll'lg the coop — while the Coop is exempt from 
covering the costs of the Special Commingling Groug 
LD1909 includes the wrong definition of a "Reverse Vending Machine" — RVMs verify every container is 
indeed a deposit item by using a laser scanner to scan each barcode That IS how they are able to provide 
fraud mitigation and accurate billing LD1909 attempts to weaken the definition of an RVM by saying the 
machines can utilize an "optical sensor" An optical sensor IS entirely different technology It is more ofa 
simple count of containers rather than a verification of each unit We are not opposed to adding a new 
definition for some other technology that utilizes an "optical sensor" but please do not water down the 
definition of a Reverse Vending Machine It's like calling a smartphone the same as an old rotary phone Or 
we agree with the definition of RVM included in LD1910 This definition is even more relevant because later in 
LD1909, the bill proposes a bonus payment of one cent for each container processed by a "reverse vending 
machine" Without 3djUStll"lg this definition, the state could be incentivizing the growth of uncompacted 
redemption — which results in higher transportation costs and higher greenhouse gas emissions withina 
program that is supposed to be reducing Maine's environmental impact' 
Set reasonable pickup deadlines and penalties, do not allow theft of property — LD1909 adjusts the pickup 
deadline from once every 15 days to once every 7 days or if the location has 20,000 containers TOMRA hasa 
strong track record of meeting the current 15 day deadline We have some recommendations to make pickup 
arrangements reliable and fair while recognizing a need for compliance measures 
a) Pickup deadlines should be based on volume, not a one size fits all approach lf the law sets an arbitrary 
one pickup per week mandate, all that will do is require a shift ofdrivers away from high volume , 
redemption centers to low volume locations in order to avoid fines, even though they may not needa 
pickup at that time This will create visible havoc at the high volume locations We will share language 
that ensures high volume locations get a pickup once a week and low volume locations get a pickup 
every 15 days unless there is a written agreement between the pickup location and the pickup provider 
b) Pickup deadlines should be based on volume, not unit - Since RVMs compact material, redemption 
locations that utilize such technology require a pickup less often The redeemed containers simply do 
not take up as much space Any volume-based pickup deadline should recognize this so Maine does not 
unnecessarily require tractor trailers to drive across the state each week 
c) Strengthen the existingpickugpenalties in the law, do not allow theft of property — ln the event that the 
beverage industry or its agent misses the 7 day pick-up deadline, LD1909 proposes allowing the 
redemption center to steal the commodity and sell it to recyclers We recognize that there should be 
some enforcement mechanism in the law, so redemption locations receive reliable pickup, but this ISl

going too far When consumers redeem containers, they become the property of the deposit initiator It 
would be a hassle anyway for your average redemption center to process the containers into bales or 
cullet by color and identify businesses who buy commodity, and ship it to them There is an existing 
\ $1,000 penalty for deposit initiators who miss the 15 day deadline (Section 3111, sub-3) We would 
recommend adjusting this to be — for each location - a verbal warning on the ﬁrst offence, Slk for the 
second offence, and $2k for the third offence 
5 The Cooperative Board must include representatives from each Commingling Group including the Special 
Commingling Group —There are currently 400+ distributors who would be in the ”Special Commingling 
Group" proposed by LD1909, who are predominately small and medium size businesses The Coop proposed 
in LD1909 will be making important decisions regarding the future and shape of Maine's deposit system that 
will affect these companies so they should have a spot on its Board 
6 LD1909 unnecessarily mandates processing within the “Account Based Bulk Processing Program" definition 
a) We recognize bag drop redemption services provide a valued service for a segment of Maine redeemers 
and defining that service making sense What doesn't make sense IS mandating that a beveragg 
company has to pay an additional processing fee should a consumer decide to use a bag drop service 
When consumers redeem containers, they are delivered to a processing or counting facility and sorted 
further by material type and color and baled, crushed or condensed in some way This is a valuable 
service that needs to take place before the broker sells the commodity to a recycler However, 
mandating processing to be performed by a bag drop provider IS bizarre What happens if that company 
charges an exorbitant price? 
b) In addition, allowing a redemption provider, in this case a bag dl"0Q_pl'OVld8l ’ , to collect containers, bale 
or condense them, and then request handling and deposits be paid is especially vulnerable to fraud 
First, the consumer does not get a chance to verify which containers were not credited towards their 
account and second, the beverage company does not get a chance to validate which containers they are 
being charged for either We have firsthand experience with the unreliability of redemption data from 
the bag drop service in Maine and as such are concerned that a mandate for processing is being included 
in the definition for what IS essentially a bag drop service 
c) To be constructive. we recommend simply substituting the "bag drop_program ” definition in LD1909 
with the one that appears in LD1910 including the criteria in Section 3109-A which sets some guidelines 
for bag drop service providers However, the criteria for bag drop in LD1910 (section 3109-A sub-3), 
should be amended to meet the current statute which says bag drop providers can only delay paying 
consumers by "two business days" not "10 days" This is critical because in Maine there is no safety net 
for redeemers who want to receive their deposit money immediately If bag drop is the only redemption 
service in their area, they already have to wait two business days to get their money back LD1910 would 
extend that to ten days, which for redeemers on the lower end of the economic spectrum can bea 
significant burden By substituting the bag drop definition in 1909 with the bag drop definition in LD1910

and th|s amended crlterla, th|s would accurately descrIbe a bag drop servlce w|th reasonable guIdelInes 
W|th that In place, there Is no need to Include a defInItIon for "Account Based Bulk ProcessIng" sInce Its 
onl\Lpurpose Is to mandate beverage companIes pay the bag drop_provIder for processlng as opposed to 
negotIatIng on a faIr playmg fIeld 
Remove the prohlbltion for a plck-up agent to pIck up from an Account Based Bulk Processmg Program— 
LD1909's new defInItIon of a ”pIck up agent" prevents such an agent from pIckIng up from an ABBPP We see 
no reason to set such a ban In law In fact, ABBPP provIders may need ass|stance to maIntaIn relIable pIck up 
servIce over the h|gh consumptlon summer months In order to 8V0ld bags overflowmg from drop off 
locatIons, wh|ch prevent some consumers from redeemmg In addItIon, pIck up agents as contractors ofa 
beverage dIstrIbutor pr0vIde a second paIr of eyes on what and how many contaIners were redeemed before 
they are processed ThIs enhances the system IntegrIty of the program 
Make sure consumers know what Is and Is not elIgIble for a deposIt refund — LD1909 and LD191O both 
weaken the labelmg requIrements that are common In nearly all deposIt systems These bIlls would allow 
contaIners to sImply be labeled wIth "ME RV" ls the average MaIner gomg to know what that means? For the 
deposIt system to reach h|gh lItter reductIon rates and h|gh recyclIng rates, the publIc needs to know what IS 
elIgIble for a deposrt refund (and on wh|ch products they pay a deposIt) The law should contInue to requIre 
the actual refund value, 5¢ or 15¢, appears on the label 
The legislature can help solve the ”orphan contaIner" Issue wItli better product regIstratIon and sIze lImIts 
— A challenge we see In MaIne Is redemptIon provIders mvestmg In redemptlon technology and havlnga 
portIon ofthe depo-sIt contaIners not accepted by the technology ThIs Is a hassle for consumers and 
Increases labor costs for the redemptIon center sInce they now need to sort these contaIners manually The 
leglslature can help mItIgate th|s by 
a) Requlre product regIstratIon 30 days prlor to sale - When a deposIt Imtlator sells a new products In MaIne 
or changes the product's barcode, the consumer Is charged the deposIt regardless of whether that 
InIt|ator reglstered theIr product In the deposIt system That means If the consumer goes to redeem theIr 
contaIner In an RVM or bag drop servlce, they wIll not be able to get theIr money back automatIcally M recommend MaIne adopts ConnectIcut's product regIstratIon language wh|ch requIres deposIt InIt|ators 
to regIster thelrproducts 30 days prIor to sale ThIs allows us to update the RVM database and allows 
consumers to regaIn theIr deposIt as soon as the product Is on the shelf 
b) Set contamer sIze |ImIts so all deposIt contaIners flt wIthIn machInes utIlIzed for reverse vendIng or bag

set size limits We would recommend Co!nnecticut ’s language which sets size limits of up to and including 
2 5 liters for non-carbonated containers iand up to an including 3 liters for carbonated containers We also 
recommend a size minimum of 4oz for rj ion-0/coho//c containers since containers smaller than this make 
up a small part of sales and are not common litter items 
Ensure auditing of any redemption rate report— The success metric for any deposit program is the 
"redemption rate" the number of containers sold with a deposit, divided by the number of deposit 
containers redeemed LD1909 and LD1910 both refer to redemption rate targets These targets are 
meaningless if the state or a third party does not audit annual redemption rate reports by regulated entities 
Whether intentional or not, underreporting of sales and unredeemed deposits is a serious issue in deposit 
systems Incorrect redemption rate data could result in millions in lost unredeemed deposit revenue and 
incorrect assessments of the program's performance which affect decisions about the deposit value

C mments on\LD1910 "An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program" 
Maine can adopt commingling without destroying a pick-up business — See comments above in #2 (page 3) 
Preserve consumer protections for bag drop users — As explained in 6c above (pg 5), bag drop users should 
only have to wait 2 business days for their container to be redeemed as is the current law, not "10 days" as 
LD1910 proposes This is especially important, because unlike most deposit systems, Maine has no 
requirement for the public to have access to redemption services that provide immediate deposit repayment 
(Section 3109, sub 4) Also, LD1910 proposes; the Coop will develop a plan to "support investment in the' 
possible establishment of sites for the collection of beverage containers" , meaning there could be many more 
unmanned drop off locations which provide rio recourse for the consumer who needs their deposit money 
back immediately 
LD1910 lacks incentives for technology, which mean it is more of a band-aid than a fix — Maine is behind 
when it comes to adopting redemption technology that helps reduce the cost and environmental impact ofa 
deposit system in 2022, Mainers returned 11% of redeemed containers via RVMs That compares with 70% in 
Connecticut, 90% in Germany and 93% in Norway The lack of incentives for technology in LD1910 means 
Maine would still be dependent on increasing labor and transportation costs — and vulnerable to fraud 
LD19010 proposes new costs for retailers and could reduce the number of redemption locations available 
to the public - The bill says the Cooperative will "develop criteria to reduce or eliminate dealer responsibility 
for accepting empty beverage containers, including financial participation by the dealer in establishing 
redemption centers or other redemption options " At this point, given the strain on redemption centers last 
summer and the drop in the redemption rate from an estimated 84% in 2017 to “low 70s" today, the public 
needs more redemption locations not less

15 Make sure consumers know what is and is not eligible for a deposit refund - As mentioned in #8 above (pg 
6), the law should not weaken the label requirements to make sure the public still knows what is redeemable 
Conclusion 
Maine's deposit system is at an inflexion point The system can continue to operate the way it has since 1978, or 
it can integrate the learnings from modern deposit systems For example, Norway's deposit system has evolved to 
be so efficient that a deposit initiator who sells a product in an aluminum can is actually paid by the deposit 
system Given the concerns over consumer access to their deposit money, declining redemption rates, and the 
highest handling fee in the country, we respectfully ask the committee to consider any major changes 
thoughtfully
