Orono, ME 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representatlve Gramllch, and drstmgurshed members of the ]O1I1t standlng 
commlttee of Envlronment and Natural Resources, 
My name 1s Abe Furth and I am the co-owner of Orono Brewmg Company We employ thrrty two people 
1n Orono, and we’ve been 1n busmess slnce 2014 I’m here today to testrfy 1n favor of LD 1910 and 
strongly 1n opposmon to LD 1909 
I’m st1ll reelmg from LD 134 and the I'ﬂél _]OI‘ prrce mcrease that w1ll h1t the Mame consumers tlus summer, 
threatemng my busmess Now I’m faced w1th another catastrophlc pnce change 1n LD 1909 Mame craft 
brewers can not handle another handlmg fee mcrease We operate on th1n marglns, and have expenenced 
the same pressures of mcreased costs and l1m1ted workforce as other Mame busmesses We, the Mame 
craft brewers, pay handhng fees — not the dlstnbutors, not the retallers — craft brewers 
Increased handlmg fees have exponentlal effects on beer prrces Unhke the 5 cent conta1ner deposlt Wl'llCh 
1s passed through as exactly 5 cents at each level of the transactlon, the handlmg fee has to be baked mto 
the prlcmg model and dlstrrbutors and retallers expect to recelve the1r respectlve margln of 28% to 32% 
on the mcreased cost of handl1ng the product Accordmgly, the 36 cents a case mcrease that has already 
been slgned 1nto law w1ll result 1n a 50 cents to $1 per four pack mcrease 1n the shelf prrce for my beers 
A $1 mcrease 1n a 4 pack of beer 1s a tremendous mcrease It w1ll lead to reduced sales and smaller proﬁt 
margms for small busmesses already operatmg on fraglle marglns Impos1ng an addrttonal handlmg fee 
mcrease (on top of the one ]ust passed) 1s slmply unsustamable and unfalr It w1ll lead to catastrophlc cost 
mcreases on the shelf that w1ll reduce Mame craft beer sales 
Addltronally, clawmg back unclalmed deposlts w1ll lead to exponentlally hlgher costs to the system 
Unclalmed deposrts go to dlstrlbutors who use thls money to offset the costs assoclated w1th p1ck up and 
transportatron of redeemable contalners that they are I‘ESpOIlSlblE for Th1s use of l1I1Cl&1II1(: ‘(l deposlts 1s 
part of the fundamental economlcs of the program and has been for two decades D1str1butors and craft 
brewers allke rely on 1t 1n our pr1c1ng models Wlthout that money - the system collapses or the money 
comes agam from brewers and consumers 
LD 1909 also proposes an automanc cost of l1v1ng mcrease to the handlmg fee That concept — consrdered 
and I‘E]€ClIEd 1n LD 134 — 1s deeply unfarr Addrtlonally, 1t d1s1ncent1v1zes all partres from engaglng 1n 
Cl1SCl1SSl0I1S around structural reform Heapmg on add1t1onal costs year after year creates an unpredlctable 
and precarlous busmess model for my brewery 
Mame brewenes and dlstrlbutors are very much 1n favor of 1mprov1ng the redemptton process and 
reducmg the amount of sorts needed We have been advocatmg for years that the current system 1s broken 
LD 1910 provldes a smart reform model that we belleve would make rmportant and lmpactful changes to 
the system Reforms to the system are cr1t1cal to 1ts long term survlval — we cannot srmply rely on ralsmg 
the handlmg fee and put off desperately needed restmctunng
Thef1nanc1a11mpactofLD 1909 severely threatens Mame b1ewe11es LD 1910 provrcles a reform 
framework that W111 provlde real modernlzatron of the system I urge you to re]ect LD 1909 and the 
addltlonal fmanclal burdens on the beverage redemptlon system, and ask you to support LD 1910 Thank 
you for your UII18 
S1 r, 
Abe Furth
