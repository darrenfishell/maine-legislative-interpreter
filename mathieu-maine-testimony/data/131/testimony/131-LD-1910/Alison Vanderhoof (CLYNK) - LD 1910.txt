Testimony of Alison Vanderhoof in Opposition to LD 1910 
”An Act to Amend the Returnable Beverage Container Program" 
Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
May 12, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Environment and Natural Resources my name IS Alison Vanderhoof, l am the outgoing CEO of CLYNK, 
and here toclay to test1fy AGAINST LD 1910 
Revisions to Maine's bottle bill are long overdue, but we are concerned with provisions in this bill that 
will roll back progress made in this session and create additional issues for the entire system Below area 
few points to consider that we believe are advantageous in the competing measure 1909 when 
compared to LD 1910 
0 The Commingling Cooperative Board beneﬁts from the representation of addit1onal 
stakeholders, as listed in LD 1909, not Just producers and distributors By including a true 
representation of entities within the system, improvements can continue with afﬁrmation that 
they do in fact improve things for at least most industry parhcipants 
0 In LD 1909 the recycling rate maintains an 85% goal which IS in-line with what Maine has 
achieved historically, while LD 1910 sets a 75% goal Maine should continue its environmental 
stewardship, not allow ourselves to take a major step backward 
0 The law today requires addit10nal pickups when 10,000 containers accumulate at a redemption 
center With 2 pickup agents in state this has meant that a Redemption Center today could have 
20,000 containers onsite before a pickup That is a ﬂoat of "$2260 Increasing that threshold to 
50,000 means Redemption Centers could be out close to $6K before a pickup, could wait 10 days 
for that pickup, accumulating even morre containers and cost and taking over all available ﬂoor 
space, and then still must wait 10 more days to get paid This is not feasible for most 
independent redemption centers 
0 And CLYNK doesn't fit into this pickup model at all We can process up to 1M containers a day in 
the summer, so if we are forced to work with a cooperative pickup agent we will need an 
additional pickup 20x per day if the threshold moves to 50,000 containers Waiting 10 days for 
that pickup IS a non-starter for us as we could end up with 15-20M loose containers piled 
around We work directly with most large producers today, but on the "'30% of our volume that 
pickup agents are responsible for we found their sen/ice very problematic last year We had to 
adjust our operat1ons unnaturally, incurring a ton of unexpected and so far uncompensated, 
cost 
0 Finally, deﬁning CLYNK's system is crit1cal as we process "'25% of containers CLYNK's goal is to 
continue advancing our technology and streamlined processing Unlike the competing bill, 1910 
doesn't recognize our operations A reminder, our Account-Based Bulk Processing (ABBP) 
happens after the consumer-facing process, so post tradittonal Redemption Center activities

ECLYNK3: 
We assert that ABBP us more thorough than what pnckup agents do today, and |t enables a 
program that IS conslderably faster and more efﬁclent 
Bag drop and ABBP are essentlal for EXpQdIt&d and accurate processmg of material As thus 
Committee works to develop solut1ons to the dated law, we urge the Commlttee to mclude both 
Technology wlll conhnue to develop and ensurmg that Mame-based tech compames are allowed to 
meet market demand and leverage the tools avallable IS Important I want to thank members of thus 
Commnttee for thelr contmued efforts to reform the program, and I am happy to answer any 
questlons
