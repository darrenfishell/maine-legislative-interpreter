LD 1261
April 10, 2023
To members of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Maine Legislature:
I am writing to urge you to vote “ought not to pass” of LD 1261, “An Act to Establish
Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Gross Sexual Assaults and Sex Trafficking of 
Children.”
Mandatory minimum sentences, no matter what the crime under which they are 
applied, do not work. A “one size fits all” approach to any situation negates the 
specific circumstances. 
Certainly, it is egregious that a person under age 12 may be a victim in some way. 
But, mandatory minimums will not prevent crime. Instead, they create people who 
spend more time in prison and are released with less ability to adjust back into 
society. 
 
Other problems with a mandatory minimum for any conviction, including against 
children under age 12:
*It will not reduce crimes against children;
*It may target younger people who commit such crimes out of ignorance, not out of 
intent;
*It takes away the opportunity for judges to sentence based on individual 
circumstances;
*It costs more to taxpayers;
*It enables a prosecutor to impose a sentence, rather than a judge;
*It may adjust a charge by a prosecutor because a 25-year sentence may be 
inappropriate for some situations;
*It may be used in a racially biased manner.
Imposing mandatory minimum sentences is not, and should not be, a partisan political
issue. It has been opposed by both conservative and liberal individuals and groups. 
Being “tough on crime” has been tried for decades and has not reduced crime. It has 
filled jails and prisons and cost billions of dollars. 
Please vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1261.
Sincerely,
Larry Dansinger
