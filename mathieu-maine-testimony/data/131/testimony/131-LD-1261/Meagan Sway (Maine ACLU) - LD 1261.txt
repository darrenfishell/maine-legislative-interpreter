TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ. 
LD 1261 - Ought Not To Pass 
An Act to Establish Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Gross Sexual 
Assault and Sex Trafficking of Children 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
' 
April 11, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary ‘ , greetings. My name is Meagan Sway, andI 
am the policy director at the ACLU of Maine, a statewide organization committed to 
advancing and preserving civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and 
U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, we oppose LD 1261 because it 
institutes mandatory minimum sentences including a mandatory minimum life 
sentence. y 
If passed, LD 1261 would increase the current minimum sentence of 20 years 
for someone convicted of gross sexual assault against a kid under age 12 to 25 years, 
create a mandatory life sentence for someone convicted of gross sexual assault ofa 
child under age 12 if the state can prove that the person has a prior conviction for the 
same thing, and a mandatory 25 year minimum for a person convicted of aggravated 
sex trafficking where the person knowingly promoted prostitution of a child under 
the age of 12. 
Children deserve to be safe. But creating mandatory minimum sentences, 
while it may satisfy a desire for vengeance, will not prevent harm from coming to 
young people. Mandatory minimum sentences instead tie judges’ hands in 
considering individual circumstances and empower prosecutors to force defendants 
to bargain away their constitutional rights. Mandatory minimums add to the United 
States’ drastic over-incarceration problem Without increasing public safety or 
deterring crime. 
We ask you to vote ought not to pass.
