Testimony in Support to LD 1674, “An Act to Require and Encourage Safe and Interconnected 
Transportation Construction Projects” 
April 27, 2023 
 
Good afternoon, Chairs Chipman and Williams and esteemed members of the Committee on 
Transportation.  My name is Dana Staples.  I am currently serving as a City Councilor, At-Large 
for the city of Auburn.  I previously served as the chair of the 2020/2021 Comprehensive Plan 
Update Committee, Auburn’s Planning Board, and the Lewiston Auburn Complete Street 
Committee. 
 
Auburn and Lewiston have shown longstanding success with a shared complete streets policy.  
Our cities routinely send construction projects to the Lewiston Auburn Complete Streets 
Committee to review project plans for new construction through a lens that considers varying 
usages of the project.  This committee continually makes the streets of Lewiston and Auburn 
safer for all users.  Too often, construction projects in our state streamline streets for 
automobiles while shutting out pedestrians and cyclists.  I wholeheartedly support LD 1674 as a 
way to bring equity to our streets. 
 
Respectfully, 
Dana Staples
