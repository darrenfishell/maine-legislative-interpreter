Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 385, Resolve, Directing the Department of Education to Examine Alternative Metrics for 
Determining the Disadvantaged Stude nt Factor in the School Funding Formula , directs the 
Maine Department of Education  (DOE)  to convene a working group of  ten (10) stakeholders to 
examine alternative metrics  used in distributing funds in the school funding formula . 
 
In the 11 6th Legislature, LD 1146 proposed to provide additional funding for students with 
limited English proficiency and who were economically disadvantaged. The final disposition of 
this bill was Ought Not to Pass ( ONTP ). This bill proposed a weighted per -pupil count for 
students with limited English proficiency and for economically disadvantaged students .  
 
The Department and Maine Education Policy Research Institute (MEPRI) continues to 
collaborate regularly in exam ining t he Essential Programs and Services (EPS)  funding formula.  
MEPRI  provide s on-going review of the metrics that contribute to the EPS  funding formula  as 
outlined in MRS Title 20-A, Chapter 606 -B Essential Programs and Services  §15686-A Review 
of essential programs and services components . We expect that  analysis of alternative data to be 
provided by MEPRI.  In addition, our Title I Team is exploring data points that inform 
allocations to school administrative units (SAUs).  
 
The D epartment  utilizes free and reduced lunch counts, and census data to inform economically 
disadvantaged student counts within the title I grant allocations to SAUs. Currently M aine uses 
an alternative  data set to make these calculations and is in the process of expl oring, based on 
post-pandemic data and the implementation of no -cost meals (breakfast and lunch) in M aine, the 
best data set to utilize to determine SAU Title I allocations. The intent is to “do the least harm” 
by which we mean for SAUs to feel the least impact fiscally, due to the changes related to 
collected data. The Department is in the process of gathering information relating to district -
certified student  count, district c -certified student count with a 1.6 multiplier, and free lunch 
counts.

It is also important to note the interconnectedness of EPS funding formula components  outlined 
in Title 20-A, Chapter 606 -B. Individual component adjustments to the EPS formula always 
have positive and negative impacts on SAUs.  Given the finite amount of funding, a calculation to 
increase one segment will necessarily decrease another segment. It would be prudent to examine 
any one element in the context of a comprehen sive study. In order to make equitable decisions 
that cause the least harm to our SAUs, the Department will need to dedicate time and resources 
to analyze the implications of any change.  
 
The Maine D epartment of Education  will be available to provide additional information  on LD 
385, Resolve, Directing the Department of Education to Examine Alternative Metrics for 
Determining the Disadvantaged  Student Factor in the School Funding Formula , and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,

Director of School Finance
