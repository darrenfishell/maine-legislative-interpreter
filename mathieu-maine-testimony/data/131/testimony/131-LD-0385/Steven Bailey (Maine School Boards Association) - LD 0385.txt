TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 385 
RESOLVE, DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO EXAMINE 
ALTERNATIVE METRICS FOR DETERMINING THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS 
FACTOR IN THE SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 385. 
Using the free and reduced lunch count to determine state aid distribution under the funding formula is an 
unreliable and inaccurate measurement of need. These counts vary from year to year and there is no assurance 
that the information is being collected by all schools. We know, for example, that older students are less 
inclined to ﬁll out the form. 
This can cause large ﬂuctuations for those districts who are right on the bubble in terms of qualifying for 
increased aid. 
There should be a better way to determine this calculation and support metrics that don’t shame students or 
short districts in terms of their aid allocation. We would be happy to suggest superintendents who could serve 
on the working group.
