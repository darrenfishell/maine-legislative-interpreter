Good

Senator
Beebe-Center ,

and
honorable
colleagues
on

Justice
and

Committee.
My
name
is
Grayson
Lookner ,
and
I
represent
House
district
113
which
includes
part
of
Portland.
I’m

today

When
I
say
the
words
“solitary
confinement,”
it
probably
conjures
an
image
in
your
mind.
I’m
am
not
here
today
to
elaborate
on
the
horrors
of
what
solitary
confinement
can
mean
for
someone
held
in
that
condition
for
too
long
of
a
period,
nor
am
I
here
to
debate
on
its
efficacy
or
necessity
in
a
corrections
setting,
I
am
simply
here
to
ask
that
we
define
a
term
that
already
appears
in
Maine
law
that
has
currently
has
no
definition.
Around
the
world,
“solitary
confinement”
is
generally
accepted
to
mean
“any
24
hour
period
in
which
a
person
is
kept
in
a
cell
for
more
than
22
hours,”
and
all
this
bill
seeks
to
do
is
to
establish
that
definition
in
Maine
Statute.
We
need
to
do
this
so
that
we
can
better
understand
how
this
practice
is
employed
in
Maine’ s
jails
and
prisons,
so
that
the
legislature
can
make
informed
decisions
about
how
to
approach
this
practice.
I
suspect
that
we
may
hear
testimony
from
the
Department
of
Corrections
later
today
that
this
bill
is
not
necessary
because
we
don’t
use
“solitary
confinement”
in
the
State
of
Maine.
If
that
is
true,
then
why
not
define
the
term?
The
DOC
uses
many
terms
for
what
a
layperson
would
understand
to
mean
solitary
confinement.
They
call
it
“administrative”
or
“disciplinary
segregation,”
they
call
it
“restrictive
housing,”
and
District
113:
Part
of
Portland

they
call
it
“close
security .”
These
terms
do
nothing
but
obfuscate
the
reality
of
what
is
happening
to
individuals
experiencing
incarceration
in
our
jails
and
prisons.
The
residents
of
DOC
facilities
also
have
their
own
terms
for
it,
such
as
“getting
lugged,”
or
“thrown
in
the
hole,”
or
“being
put
in
the
A-Pod.”
No
matter
the
words
that
an
individual
or
an
institution
uses
to
describe
this
condition,
it
is
imperative
that
the
state
defines
the
term
so
we
can
have
agreed
upon
language
when
and
if
the
legislature
decides
to
approach
this
issue
in
future
sessions.
We
legislators
are
elected
by
the
State
of
Maine
and
bestowed
with
the
title
“honorable”
because
it
is
our
duty
to
tell
the
Maine
people
the
truth.
We
are
not
here
to
help
burnish
the
reputation
of
state
agencies,
nor
to
help
them
in
their
communications
and
relations
with
the
public.
We
are
here
to
ascertain
what
the
truth
is
to
the
extent
that
we
can,
and
to
legislate
in
accordance
with
that
truth
to
the
best
of
our
ability .
Please
support
this
legislation
so
that
we
can
get
closer
to
the
truth
of
how
solitary
confinement
is
used
in
Maine’ s
prisons
and
jails.
Thank
you
for
hearing
my
testimony ,
and
I’d
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
