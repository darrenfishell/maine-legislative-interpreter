Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee: 
My name is Kyle Bennett and I am a youth steering committee member with Maine 
Youth Justice. I reside in Bangor Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to provide 
testimony in support of LD 1086. 
I am in support of LD 1086 because while being incarcerated as an adult and juvenile 
I have spent days to months in solitary confinement. The justice system uses many 
names that make up solitary confinement, while on paper it's technically not solitary 
confinement: it's a medical hold, mental health hold, protective custody, or 
administration lock up. 
While incarcerated in the last year I was housed by myself for 120 days. I did not 
have contact with other peers except in the hallway or down in actual segregation. I 
would feel like I was in solitary confinement even while not being in seg because I 
wasn't able to have contact with anyone else. Yes, I had tv privileges and could use 
the phone but for 120 days I lived in a jail cell in a two person housing block by 
myself. 
We really need a better definition of what solitary confinement really is, so that 
society realizes people who are incarcerated spend a lot of time in solitary 
confinement.
Thank you for your time and consideration passing LD 1086.
Sincerely, 
Kyle Bennett
