Testimony for the 131th Session of the Maine State Legislature 
Joint Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
 
Public Hearing April 24, 2023 
    LD 1086: OUGHT TO PASS 
 
Chairpersons Senator Anne Beebe- Center and Representative Suzanne 
Salisbury and members of the Committee, my name is Suzanne Rudalevige; I am 
retired and living in Cape Elizabeth. I am a member of the HopeGateWay Church’s 
Anti Racism Committee.  
I support this bill wholeheartedly. I have spent many years in and around 
the criminal justice system and am aware of a couple things regarding this bill.  
Firstly, I listened to the testimony at the 130th Legislative Session which 
seemed to be largely trumped by the state governmental leadership of the 
prisons’ “1984 speak”,   denying that they practice solitary confinement when it is 
known that they do   but use other words to cover that practice. Thus, a definition 
is a timely solution to that problem – one hopes. 
 Secondly, I am well aware of the racial discrimination in the criminal justice 
system at every point of contact. It is therefore most likely that those in solitary 
confinement, as here defined, are more likely to be of color. We need to have 
proper statistics which have been less than available when solitary confinement is 
used under different verbiage or denied.  
I personally believe, supported by my Christian faith, that solitary confinement 
should be outlawed, since we know from all the research and testimony of those 
so held that it is destructive of human mental capacities and totally unnecessary 
for security. This bill is a step in the right direction. 
 
 Thank you.
