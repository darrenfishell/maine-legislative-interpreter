TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE , ESQ.  
 
LD 1086—Ought to Pass  
 
An Act to Define the Term "Solitary Confinement" for the  
Laws Governing a Jail or Correctional Facility  
 
Joint Standing Committee on  
Criminal Justice and Public Safety  
 
April 24, 202 3 
 Senator Beebe -Center , Representative Salisbury and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, greetings. My name is Michael 
Kebede , and I am Policy Counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing a nd preserving civil liberties guaranteed by the Maine and 
U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, I am here to testify in support of LD 1086 .  
Human beings were not meant to be alone. Whether you approach this issue from the 
perspective of the law an d the Constitution, or international human rights conventions, or 
medicine and psychology, or philosophy, or religion, the conclusion is clear: solitary 
confinement is wrong, and we all have an obligation to end its use. More than a century ago,  the 
United  States Supreme  Court observed that solitary confinement —even for short periods — 
causes prisoners to become “violently insane” and “commit[] suicide.” In re Medley , 134 U.S. 
160, 168 (1890). More recently, a Justice of the Supreme Court has said that s olitary 
confinement imposes an “immense amount of torture and agony” on prisoners. Apodaca v. 
Raemisch , 139 S. Ct. 5, 10 (2018) (Sotomayor, J., respecting denial of certiorari).  Legislatures 
around the country have recognized this issue and become leaders in banning or limiting this 
harmful practice . Since 2018, seven states have adopted statutory restrictions on the use of  
 
 
   
 solitary confinement.1 Most recently, New York enacted the HALT Solitary Act , the most 
sweeping legislative reform of the use of solitary confinement in the country.2  
Properly defining solitary confinement is a necessary step toward ending its use. 
Prolonged deliberate isolation can cause permanent damage to anyone who experience s it. It is 
especially dangerous for people with serious mental illness. International human rights and 
health organizations, as well as the former U.N. Special Rapporteur, have denounced the use of 
prolonged isolation, which they have defined as isolation  for longer than 15 days, as torture.3 
People subjected to solitary confinement  have a higher chance of developing obsessive 
ruminations, confused thought processes, oversensitivity to stimuli (a strong startle reaction), 
irrational anger , and social with drawal.4  
If enacted, this bill would define solitary confinement as the isolation of a jail or prison 
resident from the general population of the jail or prison for 22 hours or more within a 24 -hour 
period.  There is no definition of solitary confinement in the Maine Revised Statutes , but the 
Department of Corrections (“DOC”) can – and has – promulgated rules that define solitary -like 
conditions.5 See 34-A M.R.S. §1403(1)  (“The commissioner may perform any legal act relating 
to the care, custody, treatment, relief and improvement of clients ”). A DOC policy titled 
“Disciplinary Segregation Status” defines “restrictive housing” as “ housing that separates a 
resident from the gen eral population and restricts the resident to their cell for up to twenty -two 
(22) hours per day for the safe and secure operation of the facility .” DOC Policy 15.2 
(IV)(“Definitions”). The DOC Commissioner himself has said, “It was obvious that no good
