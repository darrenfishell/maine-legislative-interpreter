This is a clear definition of what solitary confinement really is, a form of confinement
of a human being in a single cell without any meaningful contact with other people. 
The United Nations, which also adopted a resolution called The Nelson Mandela 
Rules, uses the same words in its definition. Locking people in a cell for more than 22
hours a day with almost no interaction with other people is punishment and has no 
long-term positive effect. In fact, it is counterproductive because it breaks all hope in 
people. It is a disproportionate punishment with detrimental consequences for the 
individual and for the community to which they will return. Though this bill does not 
change any county jail or Department of Corrections policies, having a common 
definition allows us to have more meaningful conversations.
