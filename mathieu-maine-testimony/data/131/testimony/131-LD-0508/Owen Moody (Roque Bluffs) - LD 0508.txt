Good afternoon, 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the joint standing committee on 
the Environment and Natural Resources Committee. 
My name is Owen Moody, and I have lobstered for 25 years. l am clammer and selectman in 
Roque Bluffs. 
I am here today to testify in support of LD 508. 
l thank Senator Grohoski for bringing this bill forward. I had given up completely on the state 
taking any interest in protecting the ocean about 5 years ago. 
For those of us who make our living on the water and support our family and others in the wild 
harvest - this is long overdue. 
As someone who has tried for years to get the attention of regulators of the water - this isa 
good step forward. 
I have watched the growing sea lice problem near the farmed fish and the net pens. 
The sea lice don't only - literally - eat the fish alive - the sea lice attacks sea urchins. 
I harvest sea urchins and while l am sure some of the decrease is due to climate change 
Some of it is also due to factory farming on the water. 
This bill which calls for a study group that extends beyond the aquaculture lobby is a good start 
to talk about what we are seeing on the ocean. We need to have this conversation before we 
lose it all.
