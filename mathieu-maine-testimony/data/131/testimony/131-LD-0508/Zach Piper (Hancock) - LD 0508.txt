Zach Piper

LD 508
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich
And honorable members of the joint standing committee on the Environment and 
Natural Resources.
 
My name is Zach Piper, and I am a lobsterman in Hancock. 
 
I am writing in support of LD 508.
 
This bill with its amendment calls for something we need - better oversight and 
protection of our natural resources.
 I make my living on the water and so do many of the people in Hancock and 
Washington Counties.
 
This past year we watched as a large industrial aquaculture project was recruited to 
Maine and an application submitted for Frenchman Bay. 
 
If it hadn’t been for the fact that the application was pulled because the company 
couldn’t find a qualifying source of smolts - I have no doubt that application would 
have moved forward.
 
Maine is hell bent on industrial scale aquaculture at any costs.  It’s time to put the 
brakes on and study what the real environmental impacts will be of this kind of 
discharge into the water.
