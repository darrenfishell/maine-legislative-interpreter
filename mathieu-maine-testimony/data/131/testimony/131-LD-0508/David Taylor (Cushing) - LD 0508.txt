Good Afternoon, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich 
And members of the joint standing committee on the Environment and Natural Resources. 
My name is David Taylor and I live in Cushing. I am chair ofthe George’s River Shellﬁsh 
Committee which consists of 5 towns - South Thomaston, Thomaston, Cushing, Warrenand St. 
George. 
I want to thank Senator Grohoski for sponsoring this bill and bringing it forward. I am testifying 
in support of L-D 508 and its amendment. 
This bill in the amendment says: 
: That the Department of Environmental Protection shall consider whether on-water 
aquaculture should be subject to the same or similar regulatory regime as land-based 
aguaculture. 
It also directs a study group that involves more than the industrial scale aquaculture that is 
represented by lobbyists in the room today. 
The state has not been proactive whether it's DMR 
(and I know we aren't talking about them today) 
or dep in protecting the wild harvest. 
We are seeing more and more aquaculture up and down the coast of Maine and that's one 
reason we are looking at putting a moratorium on large scale industrial aquaculture in the 
towns I represent. 
The state is approving leases at a rate of 95%. 
We are seeing moratoriums go on around the world for fin fish aquaculture. - Washington State 
and Nova Scotia and finﬁsh aquaculture got kicked out of Argentina completely. 
l don't pretend to have all the answers here about acreage, species or anything else but l do 
know the coast of Maine is looking a lot like the wild, wild west and it's time to stop, study it 
without those who are making their livings off increasing the number of acres and pause. 
It's important for all of us.
