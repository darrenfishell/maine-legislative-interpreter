Muscongus Bay Aquaculture
LD 508
In 30 years, we have had 24 studies on aquaculture in the state of Maine. With the 
majority focused on aquaculture development and regulation.  Our current system is 
one of the strictest in the world, and why regulators come from all over to, learn more 
about how our state manages its aquaculture industry. 
 I am in opposition of bill LD508 for a multitude of reasons, but largely due to the 
DEP being directed to consider on-water aquaculture being subjected to the same 
regulations as land-based aquaculture.  The two ecosystems are incredibly different 
and purposefully designed to have minimal impact on the surrounding areas.  
Imposing a "one-size fits all" method of management could result in real, serious, 
ecological and social impacts and makes no logical sense. Let alone the tax dollars 
another study will take to organize and execute. With three separate agencies, study 
commissions, and taking designated resources away from their main purposes. This 
study is purely politically motivated without thought to the true impacts it could, and 
most likely will, have if allowed to pass. Not to mention having only 2 of the 17 
"stakeholders" coming from the aquaculture industry.  How could this study be 
trusted in the first place, if the vast majority of individuals conducting the study have 
little to no experience in the aquaculture industry. 
To conclude, I strongly oppose bill LD508.
