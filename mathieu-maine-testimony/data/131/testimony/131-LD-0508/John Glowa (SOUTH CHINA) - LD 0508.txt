Testimony Neither for Nor Against L.D. 508 
John M. Glowa, Sr.

My name is John M. Glowa, Sr.  I live in South China.  I am a state retiree, having 
worked at the Maine Dept. of Environmental Protection for nearly twenty-nine 
years. 
Maine State government is in desperate need of reform.  The Maine Department 
of Environmental Protection is just one good example of a bad example.  It is 
unfortunate that the Maine legislature refuses to even learn about what is wrong, 
let alone try to fix it. 
I applaud Sen. Grohoski for using her position as a legislator by putting herself out 
on a limb and sponsoring this well intentioned, but inadequate bill.  There is a 
huge disconnect between the DEP’s permitting process and the need to protect 
wildlife and wildlife habitat.  The permitting process has deliberately been 
bastardized to promote habitat destruction rather than habitat protection.  The 
permitting process has been streamlined to foster “development” with little or no 
accountability of those who destroy the environment or of the Department. 
There is virtually no system of checks and balances between the three branches 
of government and little understanding among legislators of how government is 
supposed to work.  While the impetus for this bill is well meaning, requiring the 
Department to review itself is an act of futility and is a prime example of the lack 
of checks and balances.  The legislature should be commissioning a non-partisan, 
non-biased study.  It should not be instructing the DEP fox to guard the public’s 
henhouse.
