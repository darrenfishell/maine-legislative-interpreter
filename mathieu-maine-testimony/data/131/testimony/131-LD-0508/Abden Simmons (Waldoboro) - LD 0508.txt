Senator Brenner, Represenative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. 
My name is Abden Simmons and I live in Waldoboro, I am a marine harvester and a selectman. 
Our town is moving ahead with a moratorium on industrial scale aquaculture. At both the 
shellfish committee and the selectboard there is strong support in our community to takea 
breather and look at the effects and potential effects of industrial scale aquaculture. 
The moratorium was voted in unanimously in Waldoboro and we believe oversight is lacking at 
the state level ----and that's why I support LD 508 and the creating of a committee to study 
I understand that the aquaculture lobby likes to say we don't need another study. 
How can this possibly be the case? 
Aquaculture is growing exponentially and at a time when there are fewer staff 
To regulate it. I am sure those in the industry who want quick growth to think this is a winning 
dynamic. 
It may be for large scale industrial aquaculture often owned by foreign corporations- 
But what about those of us who lobster, clam, quahog, worm? You know the Mainers who 
Grew up here and have helped to keep the marine industry sustainable? 
Not such a win for to let the horse gallop away and throw the reins to those 
Who stand to benefit at the expense of others. 
Looking at the rules and regulations - with all the stakeholders at the table is where we 
Need to begin. Not another paper provided, paid for, and promoting aquaculture.
