LD 508
Greetings and thank you for considering my testimony. 
I am co-owner and operator of Bar Harbor Oyster Company and I oppose this bill.
I see LD 508 as another expensive and unnecessary move by opponents of 
aquaculture to try and limit the growth and success of the sector. We do not need 
another working group (particularly one with unfair representation of aquaculturists) 
regulating aquaculture.  If this bill passes it will require that state agencies invest 
more time and money in an effort to fix a system that is not broken. 
The existing regulatory system is stringent and adequate.  Using land-based standards 
for marine environments is senseless. Leases that are not up to standard do not pass. 
Another working group will take away resources from the existing system and could 
lead to improper regulation of existing leases. As a shellfish farmer I care deeply 
about water quality and I don't want to see effective regulation fall by the wayside 
because opponents of aquaculture want to tie up resources with another study.
Please vote ought not pass. Thank you, Joanna Fogg
