 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly in opposition to  
 LD 508,   Resolve, Dir ecting the Department of Envir onmental Pr otection to Review Its  
 Envir onmental Permitting Laws  
 befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Envir onment and Natural Resour ces 
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Brenner ,  Representative   Gramlich,   and  distinguished   members   of  the 
 Joint   Standing   Committee   on  Environment   and  Natural   Resources.   I  am  Representative   Morgan 
 Rielly ,  representing   House   District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  cannot   testify   in 
 person today , but I am submitting my written testimony   in opposition to LD 508   . 
 LD  508  was  brought   to  my  attention   yesterday .  Iâ€™m  concerned   that  this  legislation   will  enact  
 regulatory   changes   that  will  further   slow   the  leasing   process   and  create   additional   permits,  
 hurting   our  small   aquaculture   farms,   like  our  oyster   farmers.   I  am  also  worried   this  bill  will  have  
 serious   ramifications   regarding   our  working   waterfront   with  the  potential   to  damage   coastal   and 
 island communities' ability to diversify their economic base.  
 I  also  want   to  flag  to  the  committee   that  LD  508  will  direct   the  DEP   to  consider   whether  
 on-water   aquaculture   should   be  subject   to  the  same   or  similar   regulatory   regime   as  land-based  
 aquaculture.   These   are  two  entirely   different   ecosystems,   and  the  imposition   of  land  management  
 methods   on  the  water   could   result   in  serious   unintended   ecological   impacts   .  And  marine  
 aquaculture   operations   are  already   held  to  higher   standards   than  those   on  land.   The  imposition   of 
 land  use  standards   on  marine   leases   might   end  up  decreasing   regulatory   oversight   ,  which   could  
 lead to state agencies   using standards not meant for aquatic ecosystems   . 
 I  urge  my  colleagues   on  the  Environmental   and  Natural   Resources   Committee   to  please   vote 
 ought not to pass   . Thank you so much for your time and consideration.  
 District 127: Westbrook
