Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Rob 
Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources at the Department of Environmental 
Protection, speaking in opposition to L.D. 508. 
If directed by the Legislature, the DEP stands ready to examine the statutory and 
regulatory framework for permitting on-water finfish aquaculture projects and to consider

L.D. 508: Resolve, Directing the Department of Environmental Protection to Review Its Environmental 
Permitting Laws

whether on-water projects should be subject to the same regulatory regime as land- 
based projects. We would do so in consultation with the Department of Marine 
Resources, which has jurisdiction over leasing of on-water aquaculture projects under 
Title 12. 
However, we do not support the creation of a working group. Working groups, 
committees and commissions require substantial time and resources from agency staff, 
even when the Legislative Council provides additional staff support. With appropriate 
direction, DEP and DMR can evaluate the specific issues the Legislature would like us 
to evaluate and report back to the Legislature next session. Without a working group, 
we would be able to report back more quickly, before October 2024. 
The issues that DEP and DMR would consider are relatively straightforward. The 
environmental permitting laws that apply to land-based finish aquaculture projects that 
do not apply to on-water finfish projects are the Natural Resources Protection Act 
(NRPA) and the Site Location of Development Act (SLODA or Site Law). On-water 
aquaculture is exempt from NRPA and Site Law permitting because it is governed by 
DMR leasing standards under Title 12. There is substantial overlap between NRPA and 
Site Law standards and the Title 12 aquaculture leasing standards, though there are 
some differences; for example, NRPA and Site Law contain more general scenic impact 
standards and Site Law requires consideration of a project’s impacts on local air quality. 
DEP and DMR could provide a full analysis and comparison of the regulatory 
requirements for land-based and on-water aquaculture projects if requested by the 
Legislature. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
