LD 508
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and 
Natural Resources Committee.
My name is Jeff Davis and I am the chair of the selectboard in Machiasport and a 
lobsterman.
I appreciate these hearings, especially on this issue, but many of us lobstermen are 
getting their traps ready for the season, so I wanted to submit these written comments.
I support LD 508. 
In my town of Machiasport - our selectboard enacted an emergency moratorium on 
aquaculture. 
We have also voted to send an aquaculture ordinance out to the people who will vote 
on it later this year.   It was pretty much a no brainer.
I know exactly what it is like to work around the net pens owned by a foreign 
corporation.
I have personally watched what has come out of their discharge pipes - and if it’s in 
the range of what is approved by DEP - then I suspect the bar is too low.
I have reached out year after year to try and get some either involvement from the 
company or some action by the state to do monitoring around the sites. 
 I can tell you quite clearly - Nothing ever changes.
LD 508 is the first opportunity we have to have a voice in the process about 
protecting the rest of the marine industry besides aquaculture.  I have no doubt you 
will hear form industrial scale 
Aquaculturists and the companies attracting industrial aquaculture to Maine says this 
study group doesn’t include them enough.  I disagree - it just gives the rest of us who 
have been sidelined and don’t have deep pockets for industrial scale aquaculture 
lobbyists a chance to look at how the rules and regulations might better serve all of us.
I urge you to pass ld 508.
