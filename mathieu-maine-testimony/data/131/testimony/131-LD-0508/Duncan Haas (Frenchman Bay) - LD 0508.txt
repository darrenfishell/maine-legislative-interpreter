Good Afternoon, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment 
and Natural Resources Committee. 
My name is Duncan Haas - and I am testifying in support of LD 508 -Thank you Senator 
Grohoski for introducing this bill. 
My entire family lobsters in the Frenchman Bay area and I am the one they chose to come 
speak to you today. 
We were really appalled at the potential of American aquafarms coming to Frenchman Bay. 
We were concerned about the pollution American Aquafarms talked about discharging into the 
bay. 
We were deeply concerned about how American Aquafarms talked about wringing the fish 
waste out in these net pens and letting the feces filled water recirculate in Frenchman Bay. 
If you talk to lobstermen and women up and down the coast of Maine most of them will tell 
you that growing salmon in net pens is a dirty business. 
You will hear the companies that use our resource, the |\/laine waters, talk about how great 
they are but they aren't and the men and women on the water know it. 
They use our resource and refuse to disclose how much money they are making. 
More importantly, you will hear how they don't use all their acreage? Why? They fallow the 
pens WHY? Because they have ruined the bottom. 
It's dead. I ask you is there an impact? Yes. 
What is DEP doing about it - -I don't know but I think it's time to find out. 
I have attended enough hearings to tell you there is also big money behind the Maine 
Aquaculture lobby. I have heard it stated they pull a lot ofclout in Augusta- but I also heard 
their membership pays by the acre. 
Do they have an incentive to enourage aquaculturists to take as much of the ocean as 
possible? Yes. 
It's time we get some unbiased answers about what these industrial scale projects are doing to 
the water.
