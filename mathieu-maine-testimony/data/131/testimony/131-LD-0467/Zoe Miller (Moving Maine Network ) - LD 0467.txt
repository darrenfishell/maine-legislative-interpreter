Greetings Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation, 
My name is Zoe Miller, Facilitator of the Moving Maine Network, and I am submitting this 
testimony in support of LD 467: An Act to Require Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging 
Stations. 
The Moving Maine Network is a multi-sector, statewide collaborative working to ensure all 
Mainers have access to transportation regardless of background, destination, or geography. We 
are especially concerned with the needs of people with disabilities – who account for more than 
one in six Mainers. Among older Mainers, those 65 and older, one in three people has a 
disability.  
While we applaud Maine’s efforts to take climate action by vastly expanding the use of electric 
vehicles, we want to make sure that people with disabilities are not left behind in the transition. 
As major investments are made to build out Maine’s charging infrastructure, let’s make sure that 
all Mainers are considered. Building accessible infrastructure now will ensure a complete and 
equitable transition to electric vehicles in Maine.  
In closing, the Moving Maine Network supports LD 467 because it will ensure all Mainers can 
utilize electric vehicles by building accessible infrastructure. 
 
Sincerely,  
Zoe Miller, Facilitator, Moving Maine Network
