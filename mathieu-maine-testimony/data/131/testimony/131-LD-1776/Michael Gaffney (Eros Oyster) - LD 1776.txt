I write in opposition to LD 1776. 
 
This bill is yet another attempt by the NIMBY folks to work around the laws, rules, and 
administration of our current aquaculture lease decision-making process.  You earlier voted 
down their proposal to rewrite our current system, and you also voted down another bill to 
turn the process over to local authorities.  In this current bill, they propose to tie-up the process 
by encouraging subsidized anonymous lawsuits. 
 
The process is working fine (though slow), but it does not provide for refusal of a lease because 
it offends the sensibilities of some who do not want to look out over a body of water and see 
aquaculture gear.  Absence of “viewshed” consideration in lease decision-making is not an 
oversight.  It is purposeful so that aquaculture can grow our marine economy, rather than be 
strangled, as it is in California. 
 
I know of no evidence that DMR and DEP have been making bad calls on their lease decisions, 
and I suspect they will stand up quite well to any legal challenges, but the added burden of a 
flood of freebie lawsuits will certainly slow down the already lengthy process of lease 
application processing. 
 
That will impact my farm and the entire sector. 
 
Please vote “Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1776. 
 
Thank you,
