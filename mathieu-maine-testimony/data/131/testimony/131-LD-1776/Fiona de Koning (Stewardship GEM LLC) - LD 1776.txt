There are so many problems with this bill that I hardly know where to start, so
I will list but three and assume that you will hear many more.
1.The bill is worded incredibly broadly and applies to ANY and ALL DEP and DMR permits and  
rules, or any action by the Attorney General. This will effectively
paralyze governance in the State with strings of endless petitions and appeals.
2.I am extremely concerned that this bill would circumvent the existing legislative and rule  
making processes, and supplant legislative and agency authority. We have excellent checks and 
balances built in to our system here in the US. ( I was born and raised in the UK before becoming a  
naturalized US citizen). The State agencies need to be free to focus on their key functions, not  
practicing litigative risk management all the time.
3.The Maine Legislature has a long tradition of developing practical solutions to
the challenges we face in Maine. LD 1776 is not one of those and I would encourage and ask you to  
vote " Ought not to Pass".Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and Honorable members of the Joint standing
Committee on Marine Resources.
My name is Fiona de Koning, and my family and I own and operate a shellfish farm
in Bar Harbor.
Thank you for your time considering this matter.
