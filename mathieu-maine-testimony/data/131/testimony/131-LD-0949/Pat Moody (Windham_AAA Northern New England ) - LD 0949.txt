Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor & Housing. My name is Pat Moody, and I am the manager of public affairs 
for AAA Northern New England. On behalf of our organization, which serves more than 1 
million members in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, I would like to express 
our opposition to LD 949.  
 
We have communicated with the sponsor about our concerns for the potential implications to our 
AAAâ€™s emergency roadside assistance services and safety programs. We understand that 
sponsors intention is to not impact our employer-owned vehicles which are used to provide 
legendary roadside assistance and driver training. We are concerned that, as written, the bill 
lacks detail and may negatively impact our safety and roadside assistance opertations. 
 
Thank you for your time and considering our concerns for LD 949.
