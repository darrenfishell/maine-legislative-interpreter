In Opposition to  
LD 949 , An Act to Protect Workers from Employer Surveillance   
 
April 4, 2023  
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee.  My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 949 
on behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association’s  
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest.   
While the bill provides exception s to the general prohibition of employer surveillance  
activities , it is unclear whether the provision , which read s “...if it is stric tly necessary to ensure 
employee health and safety or the security of employer data” is broad enough to address the  
surveillance tools used by municipal employers , such as GPS technology , the body cameras 
worn by law enforcement  offic ials, and computer log -in funct ions.   
In many cases, the technology and equipment used at the local level ensure s the proper  
investment of limited  property taxpayer resources, keep s residents, business owners and guests 
safe, and in some instances, such as monitoring the amount of salt applied to roads during winter 
storm event s, protects the environment as well. Additionally , program s used to track  and prevent  
access to certain websites have  played an i mporta nt role in  mitigating  the adverse  impacts of 
cyber -attacks .     
While all employees are certainly entitle d to privacy in their homes and automobiles , 
when preform j ob relat ed functions  there is a time and a place for surveillance  and employers 
should  retain the right to do so  as determined  warranted .   
Thank  you for considering the municipal perspective.  If you have any questions about 
the Association’s position, please do not hesitate to contact me at either 1 -800-452-8786 or
