Re:  LD 949 – AN ACT TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM EMPLOYER 
SURVEILLANCE  
 
Dear Chair Senator Michael Tipping, Co -Chair Representati ve Am y Roeder, and Members of the 
Committee on Labor and Housing : 
 
My name is Seth Garrison, and I am the General Manager of the Portland Water District. I 
provide this letter to you in  opposition to LD 949.  
 
The Portland Water District (PWD, the “Distri ct”) is a public utility  created  by private and 
special law of the State Legislatur e in 19 08 to provide drinking water to the people of greater 
Portland. Today , PWD provides drinking water to over 200,000 people in eleven communities, 
and wastewater service s to si x of those communities. The affairs  of PWD  are managed by a  
Board of  Truste es composed of 11 members, all popularly  elected  by the voters from the 
communities  they represent.  
 
PWD  has approximately  180 employees  and manages a fleet of 85 veh icles, 25 trailers , six 
pieces of mobile construction equip ment, and two boats.  PWD employ s a fleet management 
system  that includes GPS tra cking features . It allows us to responsibly track our mobile  assets for 
our customers , so we can be sure they are getting max imum value  from them . Our fleet 
management  system  also helps PW D maintain  its veh icles by monitoring  such items as tire 
pressure, mileage , fuel fill-ups, braking pat terns , speeds , etc. All PWD employees  have received  
notice and are aware there are tracking  syste ms in the vehicles . 
 
Fleet management  data is acces sed by PWD for a variety of useful purposes. It is routinely used 
for scheduling ; for examp le, an employee  working in one communit y can be sent to a  call at an 
adjacent location saving time and re sources witho ut having the employee required to return to 
home base. It is also used to monitor the performance  of assets, so we can ensure our fleet is 
running efficiently . When cust omers call with questions about  a PWD vehicle  or another vehicle 
they suspec t to be a PWD vehicle , the tracking data can confirm  if, in fact , it was a PWD fle et 
vehicle . This is invaluable for pr oving to customers that we are responsible for our vehicles  and 
their operators.  Data als o assists in accident in vestigations  and deterri ng theft. We can easily 
track a vehicle  if it is stolen .

Phone:  207.774 -5961             Fax:  207.761 -8329            Web:  w ww.pwd.org  Fleet Management using GPS is a valuable tool that PWD uses to protect customers and ensure 
they are getting the maximum value out of fleet investments. LD 949 would prohibit the 
legitimate  use of this resou rce. PWD is in the business of  public service , and the public demands 
that our operations , which  ratepayers pay for, be efficient  and economically eff ective. Utilizing 
tracking allows us to  meet these expectations.  
 
For these reasons, we hope tha t you will  oppose LD 949.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.  
 
 
Seth Garrison
