Testimony in Support of LD 841:
“An Act to Permit
a Short-term Waiver from the
Minimum Wage for Chronically Unemployed Individuals”
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as director of
policy for Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a nonpartisan,
non-profit organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic freedom in
Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 841.
We commend Rep. Walker for this creative idea to help workers who have been
unable to land a job recently, because they may be under-skilled or under-qualified to be
paid the state minimum wage. Minimum wage may indeed be too high for these workers
to match their skills and experience at the time of hiring.
LD 841 provides many safeguards for the worker, not only to allow retention of
public benefits upon taking work under this provision, but ensures that they will only be
earning sub-minimum pay for as long as their most recent unemployed stint.
It is also important to remember that this provision would only concern those
who truly cannot get a job at the current minimum wage. Eligible participants must
have been without work for at least the last two years.
LD 841 truly focuses on the workers in need of a leg up. Please deem it “Ought To
Pass” and provide these workers a step stool to the wage ladder. Thank you for your time
and consideration.
