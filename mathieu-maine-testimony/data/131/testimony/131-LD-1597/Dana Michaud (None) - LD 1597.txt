Good evening Mr Jackson, I heard that you are working on the subject of Agent Orange (White, Yellow, 
Purple) for the Army National Guard members that was in Gage Town, Canada. With only a very short notice 
to gather some information, like many, many Guardsman that has spent several 2 week Camps there, I just 
contacted a few of our members and I’m sending you son quick notes, hopefully to help with your case about 
these Chemicals that we’re, and still is at this Base in Gage Town. 
Myself (Dana Michaud) was in the Guards for 7 years (1981-1988), which 5 of these 2 week training exercises 
were spent at Gage Town Military Base, where I (myself) heard about Agent Orange being over there. I also 
contacted a few other members that asked me to pass on their information if possible? 
1: Roger McCausland: 28 years in Army National Guard spent 20 of his 2 wk training at Gage Town; he 
noticed burnt vegetation, and extremely heavy dusty roads. 
2: Nelson Saucier: 25 years in with 22 of those (2 wk) Training Camp at Gage Town, he said that he was told 
while over there that Agent Orange was there and sprayed around, he noticed several burnt looking trees while 
there. 
3: Terry Tarr: 21 years (1968-1974, then 1986-2001) where he also heard about Agent Orange being over there. 
He noticed lots of vegetation that was burnt. 
I wish we could get an extension on the hearing/agenda with this subject of the Agent Orange (White, Yellow, 
Purple) so to gather more letters/information from many of our Army members. 
I have read that all the Canadian soldiers that has been on Gage Town Base and other Military Forces from 
other parts of the world like Australia, England, and one more country I can’t remember right now, All were 
Paid money ($20,000) each for having to train on Gage Town Military Base. 
I hope that this information is useful/helpful in any way!?? 
I THANK YOU in advance for anything that you are able to doll
