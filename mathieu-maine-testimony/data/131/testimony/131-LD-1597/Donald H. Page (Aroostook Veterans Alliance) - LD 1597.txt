My name is Donald H. Page, in support of LD 1597 and representing 
AVA (Aroostook Veterans Alliance). I am a resident of Fort Fairfield. I 
served 20 years as an Army National Guardsman and attended 20 2 -
week training periods in which approximately 15 or 16 were in 
Gagetown, Canada.  
 
Myself, I witnessed dead animals, the grass was all brown, the trees 
were brown, and the leaves were dead. When it rained, it looked like 
the chemicals were coming out of the ground. The water on the tank 
trails looked like coffee with creamer in it. We were all over the 
Gagetown base doing our training.  
Then in the 80’s, we saw where they put wire with signs saying – Stay 
Out. We heard from the Canadian Armed Forces talking about the 
Agent Orange.   The Can adian government did recognize this problem 
way back in the 80’s.  
We have given help to Vietnam veterans and a few other places. It is 
time to recognize the Army National Guard that were in Gagetown, 
Canada. Last count just in 152nd Field Artillery, A Batt ery was 39 
deceased from out of approximately 100 died from this Agent Orange. 
Just in A Battery alone, Presque Isle. This is out of the 500 -member 
Battalion.  30% of this A Battery have died and that number is 
increasing. Many are sick and need help right  now.  Spouses and their 
families need your help.  
I have set up a time of coffee  for A Battery at McDonald’s  each first 
Saturday  of every month at 9AM in place of our regular guard weekend. 
I have  a place for the team to talk and unwind with each other.  They are 
coming and it is a great time of friendship for us.  Many of them are very 
depressed about  our government helping them. I hope and pray that 
this Bill LD 1597 will be the beginning of help for us.
