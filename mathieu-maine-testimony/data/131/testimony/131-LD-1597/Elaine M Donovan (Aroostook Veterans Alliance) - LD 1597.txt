My name is Elaine Olson D onovan  of Aroostook Veterans Alliance. I live 
in Fort Fairfield. I am the wife of an Army National Guardsman , David  A. 
Donovan.  We have been married 54 years 8 months already.  All of 
them as a wife of a n ANG. He sign ed up before his draft notice came 
and did his b asic, etc., before we were married. He went to camp  Drum, 
NY, AP Hill, VA, and Gagetown, Canada for his summer camps. About 8 
of them at Gagetown  of the 12 years he was in the Guard. I went down 
on the weekend to 2 of the summer camps in Gagetown. I had my 
cancer first – total hysterectomy , then  David had 2 cancers. The first was 
a total saturated prostate  removed, then malignant melanoma  on his 
back. Answered prayers from  our Lord, we both came out – all well and 
good.  There wasn ’t any help from the National Guard, so we were on 
our own  financially.  
 
I am proud of David and all the men and women who are serving and 
have served. When I see a Veteran, I thank him for his or her service. It 
is time we thanked our Guards men and women and don’t forget the 
spouse left behind. She or he still needs to know that we care for the 
sacrifices they have made. It is time that we step up to the plate!  
 
Before I close,  I would like to share some of the concerns that David had 
when he came home from summer camps. He talked about the dead 
small animal s, birds, squirrels, etc. and some strange dust all over 
everything. He was wondering what that was all about. If they we re 
spraying foliage, why all the animals around were dying? What was 
happening. Then we found out about Agent Orange!  So many of our 
guys have already died from this, most of them searchi ng for help for 
their families. Please let us help the few that are  left! My husband is still 
alive , but who knows for how long?
