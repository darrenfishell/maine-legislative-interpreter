James Gehring
Aroostook Veterans Alliance
LD 1597
My name is James Gehring, a US Navy Veteran who served his country from 1964 - 
1968 during the Vietnam war.  This statement is being submitted in support of 
Senator Troy Jackson's proposal to establish a study commission to investigate the use
of agent orange and other chemicals at Gagetown, New Brunswick, Canada 
(LD1597).  Over the past 20 years I have served as a field Service Officer for the 
American Legion, Disabled American Veterans and currently Service Officer for the 
Aroostook Veterans Alliance (AVA).  During my tenure I have submitted countless 
disability claims to the Veterans Administration for those soldiers who trained at 
Gagetown and developed various types of cancers as a result of exposure to agent 
orange and other chemicals used to defoliate the training areas.  All of these claims 
were denied for two reasons.  Gagetown is not recognized  as a presumptive site for 
exposure to agent orange even though the Canadian Government did acknowledge 
and assist Canadian soldiers monetarily. Second, the National Guard soldiers were 
not/are not recognized as "Veterans" at the U.S. Federal level due to lack of 
consecutive active duty time. The presumptive list of cancers caused by agent orange 
are the same for Gagetown soldiers and those who served during the Vietnam war.  
As a Service Officer who has assisted over 900 veterans obtain their earned benefits 
and disability compensation applaud and support Senator Jackson"s proposed 
legislation to form a commission to determine what might be done to support those 
veterans affected by the application of agent orange at the Gagetown training facility.
