LD 238 ought-NOT-to pass for several reasons.
This bill does not belong in this committee. 
This is a hornets nest. Why just covid?  Why not covid vaccine injured as that number
is superceeding those with indirect injuries from thr virus itself? Do you realize the 
enormity of this situation?.
The pharmaceutical companies should be paying restitution for all those injured by 
the vaccine.  There is  a lawsuit in play at this time claiming the vaccine 
manufacturers broke their agreements in the conditions of Project Warp Speed. 
I doubt the state has the funds to cover such a program.
Thank you.
