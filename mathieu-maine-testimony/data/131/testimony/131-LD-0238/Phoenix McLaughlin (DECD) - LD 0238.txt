Dear Senator Curry , Representative Roberts , and members of the Committee ,  
 
I am writing regarding LD 238, An Act to Create a Program for Mortgage Assistance for Persons 
with Illnesses Related to COVID -19. The bill would assign the Department of Economic and 
Community Development the responsibility of administering a fund to support homeowners who 
have experienced hardship due to COVID -19 illness . As you will hear today, MaineHousing has 
already been allocated funds for the same purp ose. DECD would support focusing  efforts  on that 
existing program and direct ing any additional legislation on the issue, should the Committee 
decide to pursue it,  towards the existing MaineHousing program for better efficiency.   
 
We are happy to answer any questions the Committee may have following the public hearing and 
be present at the work session for LD 238 if requested.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Phoenix McLaughlin  
Tax Incentive Policy Manager
