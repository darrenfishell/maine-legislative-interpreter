TESTIMONY OF 
RANDALL A LIBERTY, COMMISSIONER 
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS L 
In Support of 
LD 720 An Act to Implement Certain Recommendations of the Commission to Examine Reestablishing Parole 
Before the 
Committee on Judiciary 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and other distinguished members of the Committee on Judiciary, I am 
Randall Liberty, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections providing testimony in support of Senator 
I-Iickman ’s amendment to LD 720 
As a member of the Commission to Examine Reestablishing Parole, I can tell you there was extensive work done over the 
three months, ﬁve meetings, and countless emails, includes dozens of requests for information to my department 
I am proud to be associated with the committee, even if the State’s position opposing the reestablishment of parole has not 
wavered 
One of the topics that came up often during the Commission was that of the MDOC’s Supervised Community 
Conﬁnement Program (SCCP) The purpose of SCCP is to provide a means to early release of adult facility residents into 
the community prior to their release date Residents transferred to supervised community conﬁnement are still considered 
to be in the legal custody of the Department while in the program The place of conﬁnement is in the community, rather 
than in a department facility SCCP allows residents to live, work, and be active in their communities, with supervision 
and stipulations, while ﬁnishing the remainder of their sentence 
Part of the ongoing opposition to reinstating parole is because the MDOC already has a system in place to allow 
rehabilitated residents to release to the community prior to their sentence ending the Supervised Community Conﬁnement 
Program (SCCP) 
The amendment Senator Hickman is offering will allow more residents access to SCCP A cursory review of residents 
who may be considered to have a “worsening_prognosis that is likely to result in a terminal or severely incapacitating_ 
medical condition, ” identiﬁes about 40 residents, some of whom live in Assisted Living Units within the MDOC who 
could become eligible for early release under the passage of this bill 
The amendment to this bill aligns with the changes to SCCP made into law last year, during the 130'“ , after the passage of 
Speaker Talbot Ross’s LD 1593 An Act to Provide Pathways to Rehabilitation, Reentry, and Reintegration 
The changes to SCCP bome out of the passage of this bill included 
I Changing the sentence length eligibility for SCCP from 18 months to 2 years 
' The ability for a resident to go on SCCP at 30 months (from 24 months) if probation has a case load of less than 90 
clients 
- Implementation of established criteria and process for determining eligibility (Section 2-A)
