T estzmony of Representatzve Melanie Sachs zn opposztzon to LD 720, 
An Act to Implement Certain Recommendations of the Commission to Examme 
Reestablishing Parole 
Before the Jomt Standzng Commzttee on Judzczary 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen and esteemed members of the .T01nt Standlng 
Commlttee on J ud1c1a1y, my name 1s Melame Sachs and I am honored represent the communlty 
of Freeport 1n the Ma1ne Leglslature I am before you today 1n oppos1t1on to LD 720, “An Act to 
Implement Certazn Recommendatzons of the Commzsszon to Examzne Reestablzshzng Parole” 
Just last week, your colleagues 1n the Cnmlnal Justlce and Pllbl1C Safety Commlttee helda 
publ1c hearlng on my b1ll LD 1863, “An Act to Faczlltate the Provzszon of Medzcally Appropriate 
Levels of Care for Clients of Correctzonal Faczlztzes ” whlch offers changes to the exact same 
statute that 1s be1ng cons1dered here- T1tle 34, regardlng term1nally 111 or med1cal1y 1ncapac1tated 
resldents LD 1863 1s s1m1lar to a b1ll that was offered 1n the 130st Leglslature, sponsored by the 
Honorable V1ctor1a Morales She w1thdreW that b1ll after bemg told by the department they 
would 1ncorporate her proposed b1ll 1nto the1r pol1cy rev1s1ons 1n January 2022 
They d1d not 
They lnstead testlﬁed agalnst LD 1863, but then hastlly 1nserted th1s phrase proposmg a statute 
rev1s1on and sent the language for LD 720 to the sponsor last week 
LD 720, the b1ll before you, does not actually make any substantlal changes to the1r current 
pract1ce There 1s nothlng m thelr current pohcy, MDOC pohcy 27 2, wh1ch would not allow 
thelr med1cal ofﬁcer to consrder a worsemng cond1t1on, as the evaluat1on of med1cal necesslty 
rests solely, both currently and 1n thelr proposed language, wlth the Department's Dlrector of 
Medrcal Care 
LD 1863, by contrast, proposes statutory changes to T1t1e 34-A to g1ve clear d1rect1on to help 
gulde pol1cy and ut1l1zat1on us1ng best practlces 
LD 1863 proposes to: 
D1str1ct 102 Fleeport
A. Drrect the commlssloner to develop procedures to provrde mformatron to staff, cllents and 
cl1ents'fr1ends and famrly regardmg serv1ces avarlable under tlns subsectron, mcludmg, but not 
l1m1ted to, ass1sted l1v1ng, nursmg care, hosp1ce and home health care serv1ces New systems are 
bemg developed to help res1dents become aware of the1r el1g1b1l1ty for early release Th1s b1ll 
strengthens commumcatron to res1dents, fam1l1es, and staff about th1s optlon 
B. Requlre ut1l1zat1on of the ob] ect1ve standard used by Ma1neCare and hcensed long term care 
fac1l1t1es, both here 1n Mame and natlonally, to determme whether a person qualrﬁes for long 
term care Cmrently, med1calnecess1ty 1s determlned only by the Depa1tment ’s Drrector of 
Medlcal Care LD 1863 requ1res that resrdents have the standard Long-term Care Adv1sor_v 
Assessment whlch all Ma1ne people need 1n order to assess cl1n1cal el1g1b1l1ty for nurs1ng home 
placement The assessment cl1n1cally determmes “1f the person 1s el1g1ble for posslble fac1l1ty 
adm1ss1on, or 1n-home serv1ces funded through Ma1neCare or state funded home-based care 
programs Ind1v1duals choosmg to enter a nursmg fac1l1ty must have tlns type of assessment to 
comply W1th the State statutes unless enterlng under skrlled care ” Every res1dent and or thelr 
famrly member should have the ab1l1ty to request the requlred Long-tenn Care Advrsory 
Assessment to determme cl1n1cal el1g1b1l1ty 
C. Requ1re that if tl'11s cl1n1cal necessrty 1s met, the commrssroner shall ensure that each c11ent 
rece1ves the serv1ces determined to be needed and 1s placed 1n a fac1l1ty approprrate for the level 
of care requrred w1th1n 30 work1ng days of a request Th1s can mean transfer w1th1n the 
correctronal fac1l1ty or 1n the commun1ty, but the fac1l1ty should be hcensed to meet that level of 
care Volunteers prov1d1ng suppo1t1ve care and v1s1tat1on 1s not true hosp1ce care, for example, 
nor 1s a nurse Just checkmg 1n on a res1dent weekly who actually needs and meets cl1mcal 
necessrty for nursmg home Programs and fac1l1t1es should be hcensed to assure an adequate 
level of care 
D. Requrre the Department to collect data and report weekly on the number of clrents us1ng 
serv1ces under thrs subsectron mcludmg apphcatlons for med1cal evaluat1ons and appl1cat1ons for 
placement, acceptance or denlal for serv1ces, type and number of placements, and assocrated 
demographrc data, mcludmg, but not l1m1ted to race, gender and age The data must be 
annuallzed and must be mcluded 1n the department's full annual report to the Legrslature Th1s 
data requlrement would not only ahgn W1th many of the stat1st1cs already gathered by the 
Department, but also provrde ev1dence to what the Department has acknowledged 1s a grow1ng 
trend of agmg lmnates 
LD 1863 proposes to evaluate ut1l1zat1on of the program through data collect1on, makmg access 
easy for folks to request 1t or proactlvely offerlng 1t to those who quahfy, and standards for 
med1cal determ1nat1on and cl1n1cal assessment that are wrdely used It does not change the 
appl1cat10n procedure, nor the safety assessment necessary for successful appl1cat1ons 
The reason I was asked to sponsor LD 1863 by my constltuent 1s that I am a hcensed cllmcal 
SOC12ll worker with over two decades of experrence 1n healthcare, pol1cy and commumty-based 
serv1ces Th1s 1ncludes my work as a homecare and hosp1ce supervrsor for ﬁve rural count1es 1n 
Northem and Downeast Mame I have also provrded palhatrve care serv1ces as a hosprtal socral 
worker and have extensrve expenence w1th both dement1a screenlngs and nurs1ng home

placements that requlred cl1n1cal level of care assessments I am not here to bum down a system, 
but to propose senslble changes to make 1t work better, wlth four clear 0bJect1ves better 
access1b1l1ty, standard1zat1on, ut1l1zat1on, and data collect1on 
LD 1863 1s scheduled for a Work sesslon th1s week I respectfully ask th1s commlttee to vote 
Ought Not T0 Pass for LD 720 to allow CJPS to do 1ts work and fully evaluate th1s pol1cy 1na
