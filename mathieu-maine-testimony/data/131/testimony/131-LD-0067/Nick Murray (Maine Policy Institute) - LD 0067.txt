Testimony in Support of LD 67:
“An Act to Increase
the Number of Educational
Professionals by Accepting Out-of-state Certification”
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as
director of policy for Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a
nonpartisan, non-profit organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic
freedom in Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 67.
This bill would require the Maine Department of Education to accept
certifications held by administrators, teachers, educational technicians and educational
specialists issued by other states, U.S. territories and other countries as an equivalent in
Maine. The bill would help schools find adequate staff to fill vacant positions, an issue
with which many have struggled since the pandemic.
This problem is not specific to schools, however. Maine Policy has consistently
advocated for reducing unnecessary barriers for Mainers to work in their preferred field
for many years. Five years ago, we documented the costs of the many state occupational
licensing regimes. These range from fees, to paperwork, educational requirements, to
wasted time waiting for the bureaucracy to catch up with one’s application, all to simply
work in one’s field of expertise.

So, why stop at teachers and other school employees–shouldn’t this same logic be
expanded to most occupational licenses and certifications? If someone has already
obtained licensure or certification in another state, it makes little economic sense to
force them to jump through arbitrary and duplicative hoops here in Maine simply to
obtain the government permission slip they had already obtained elsewhere.
This principle is known as universal reciprocity and is helping to substantially
lower barriers for hardworking people all over the nation. Nineteen states–including
New Hampshire and Vermont–have adopted it since 2018.

We commend Rep. Doudera for sponsoring this piece of legislation and urge this
committee and others to apply this mindset to other regulated professions. Please deem
LD 67 “Ought To Pass.” Thank you for your time and consideration.
