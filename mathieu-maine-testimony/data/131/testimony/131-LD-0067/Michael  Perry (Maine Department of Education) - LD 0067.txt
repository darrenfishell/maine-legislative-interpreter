Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan , and Distinguished Members of the Education and C ultural 
Affairs Committee:  
LD 67, An Act to Increase the Number of Educational Professionals by Accepting Out -of-state 
Certification , proposes that the Department of Education accept certificates for administrators, 
teachers, education technicians, and education specialists that are issue d out-of-state as qualification 
for a corresponding certificate in Maine.  
The current certification process is three weeks from the time an applicant  submits a completed 
application  throug h the online Maine Educational Information System (MEIS)  until they receive 
either an evaluation letter asking for more information or a Conditional /Professional  Certificate .  The 
cost of the application is $100.00  for a teaching certificate and $200 for an administrative certificate . 
In addition,  the applicant  must pay $ 55.00 for fingerprinting . 
 Currently, the State Board of Education’s newly revised Rule Chapter 115 :  The Credentialing of 
Education Personnel,  has a provision which states that  “individuals holding a full certificate as an 
administrator, a teacher, or a specialist issued by an other state, the District of Columbia, a United 
States territory or other country  deemed comparable by the Depa rtment may qualif y for a 
professional certificate in the State of Maine.”  In many  cases, the out-of-state certificates and 
endorsements  may not match with the ones outlined in Chapter 115 .  After a transcript analysis , the 
certification team communicat es with an applicant  about which Maine endorsement  they are eligible  
to receive.  There is a wide variety in the kinds of credentials, certificate  types , and certificate 
requirements from state to state.  For example , Texas and Florida do not req uire the successful 
completion of coursework for certification.  New Mexico has three different levels of a professional 
teachin g certificate , whereas in Maine we only have one.  Determining the Maine credential for 
which out-of-state applicants are qualified is an important process that ensures the educators in 
Maine are  appropriately  qualified .   
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 67 and respond to  any 
questions during the upcoming work se ssion.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Michael T. Perry , Acting Director  
Office of Higher Education & Educator Support Services
