CROSS BUILDING, ROOM 202 
TESTIIVIONY BY WORKERS’ COMPENSATION BOARD 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor 
and Housing, I am John Rohde, the Executive Director of the Workers’ Compensation Board. On 
behalf of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Board, I am here to testify Neither for Nor Against

With respect to section 2 of the bill, which would amend Tile 39-A, the consensus amongst the 
directors of the Workers’ Compensation Board Was to testify Neither For Nor Against L.D. 1123 
because they Wanted more information before discussing the relative merits of this bill. 
Thank you, and, I am happy to try and answer questions you may have.
