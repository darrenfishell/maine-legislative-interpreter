SUBJECT: Testimony on L.D. 1123 - An Act to Create a Presumption That a Cardiovascular 
Injury or Disease or Pulmonary Disease Suffered by Certain law Enforcement 
Officers Is in the Course of Employment 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Ioint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Kathy Morin, and I am the Director of 
Actuarial and Legislative Affairs for the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. 
MainePERS is neither for nor against L.D. 1123. We are here to provide information and offer 
any assistance the Committee might need regarding this bill. 
It is unclear to us what is intended by Section 1 of the bill. It appears to establish a presumption 
under MainePERS disability laws for law enforcement officers with certain injuries or diseases. 
However, MainePERS disability retirement benefit eligibility does not distinguish between 
work and non-work related conditions so presuming that a disability is incurred in the line of 
duty has no bearing on eligibility determinations. Further, the language as drafted amendsa 
section of MainePERS law that is associated with a disability program that is no longer 
applicable to active members who might apply for a disability retirement benefit in the future. 
Once we better understand the issue that L.D. 1123 is trying to address, we would be happy 
to work with the sponsor and the Committee in determining ways to address the issue. 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony. I would be happy to answer your 
questions and will be available at your work session.
