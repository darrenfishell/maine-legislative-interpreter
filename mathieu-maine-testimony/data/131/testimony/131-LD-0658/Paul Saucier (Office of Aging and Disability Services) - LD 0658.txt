Senator Baldacci , Representative  Meyer , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services:  
 
This letter is written to provide the Committee with information as it relates to LD  658, An Act to 
Increase Funding for and Stabilize the Independent  Housing with Services Program Under the 
Department of Health  and Human Services   
 
This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services , Office of Aging and Disab ility 
Services , to increase and provide on -going funding under Chapter 5, Section 62,  Independent Housing 
with Services Program  (IHSP). The IHSP program provides assistance to individuals living in 
apartments  provided by local housing authorities and other entities. The program target s individuals who 
need assistance to remain independent .  
 
The recent passage  of PL 202 3 Ch. 17, Part 1 of the Governor ’s biennial  budget , includes  a 4.9% COLA 
increase for IHSP providers , aligning an IHSP increase with that received by similar MaineCare services  
last year . Since that increase was proposed , there has been an additional annual adjustment of 8.2% on 
January 1, 2023, for certain MaineCare -funded  LTSS services. OADS is exploring options to support a 
comparable increase for IHSP programs.  
 
The current budget initiative of 4.9% and the potential additional increase of 8.2% would cost 
approx imately  $73,000 per year. The amount proposed in this bill ( $2.5 million  per year ) is nearly five 
times  the program’s current  annual expenditures ($ 534,000 ). The  Department is not aware of how the 
amount in the bill was derived .  
 
The costs of the IHSP program have not been studied  in recent history.  As noted above, t he Department 
is recommending COLAs as a short -term strategy to sustain IHSP programs while a thorough cost study 
is developed.    
 
We are happy to provide additional information as needed at a work session.   
 
Sincerely,  
 
Paul Saucier,  Director  
Office of Aging and Disability Services
