Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 1486 on behalf of the 70 
municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Association ’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal interest. 
‘ 
As stated in MMA’s testimony on other related bills, reducing the amount of excise tax 
revenues available to municipalities will have the impact of shifting burdens onto all property 
taxpayers. LD 1486 is of particular concern, as the wear and tear caused by heavier vehicles puts 
local investments at risk. In 2020, it is estimated that municipalities expended $275 million to 
maintain and improve municipal roads and bridges. The excise taxes paid by all road users 
helped to offset the burdens placed on the property owners. 
Taking into consideration the condition of state and local roads and the need for ongoing 
investment, a proposal of this magnitude strikes municipal leaders as counterintuitive. 
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue. If you have any 
questions about the Association ’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufourga/;memun.org or 1-800-452-8786.
