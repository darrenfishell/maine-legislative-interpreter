LD 1347
I support LD 1347 “An Act to Eliminate the Current Net Energy Billing Policy in 
Maine.”
By what I understand, we as electricity ratepayers throughout the state are paying 
several hundred dollars more per year for our electricity, to subsidize solar or 
otherwise “green” energy initiatives.  As I see it, we are subsidizing the Chinese solar 
panel industry, and out-of-state solar panel installation companies.
 
With the extremely high cost of our electricity supply, and with Central Maine Power 
(CMP) set to increase our electricity delivery charge very soon, our state should be 
working tirelessly to reduce our electricity costs, not watch them continuously go up. 
The last two “standard offer” electricity increases (January 2022 and 2023) have 
driven Maine electricity consumers over the edge. I understand CMP recently 
delivered over 62,000 disconnect notices to consumers. About 10% of all Maine 
households. People are struggling. That’s disgraceful.
Let’s drive those electricity costs down, not up! Again, I support LD 1347 “An Act to 
Eliminate the Current Net Energy Billing Policy in Maine”, and it ought to pass.
