Re: Testimony in opposition to LD 1347, “An Act to Eliminate the Current Net Energy 
Billing Policy in Maine” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1347 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable Energy 
Association (“MREA”). 
For the last few years there is no likely no other issue that has received more time and attention 
from this committee than Net Energy Billing (“NEB”). It is clear there are those who wish to see 
today’s NEB policy to continue unimpeded, others who wish to see lessons learned and applied 
to a successor program, and still others who Want to see it entirely halted. 
In fact, in the last three years there has been not ogre‘ , but Q1532 retroactive policy changes 
enacted and applied to many of the projects attempting to reach commercial operation under 
today’s NEB law — notably, the industry willingly participated in many of these conversations 
and ultimately did not oppose either one. Some of you on this committee rightly chose to usea 
scalpel to make targeted changes to the NEB program; unfortunately, LD 1347 isa 
sledgehammer. 
To be clear, the NEB program is not perfect — but neither is any other energy or even non-energy 
policy the Legislature creates and state agencies implement. What is important is that this 
committee dedicates time to these programs, studies them closely, and ultimately designs policy 
improvements for the next iteration of the policy to continue delivering value to Maine 
consumers and predictable processes for developers aiming to deploy their capital here. If We 
care about the state’s business reputation, our cormnitment to addressing climate change, and to 
offering consumers a choice about which sources of energy powers their homes and businesses, 
we cannot and must not continue trying to retroactively change or — in the case of LD 1347— 
completely eliminate programs. A number of states are on their 2"“ , 3"‘ , or 4"‘ iteration of their

distributed generation (“DG”) policies — and they have wisely chosen to prospectively apply 
lessons learned to their successor programs, as opposed to trying to stop investment in its tracks 
as this legislation would do. 
It is important to remember that our DG resources are offering meaningful value to consumers, 
to the grid, and those companies actively involved in developing and constructing them. There 
are grid upgrades being paid for by DG companies right now — and in the end those investments 
will help reduce future grid resiliency costs as we continue our pursuit of beneﬁcial 
electriﬁcation. 
We must also draw your attention to the fact that our grid’s limitations effectively place a natural 
cap on the number of projects and megawatts that will be able to interconnect and become 
operational. As recently as last year we spoke to this committee about project attrition rates that 
we expected would be somewhere in the 50-60% range for a number reasons (e.g., grid 
limitations, permitting challenges, supply chain issues, and more). Based on more recent 
information coming out of cluster studies, it appears that our attrition percentage estimates have 
proven to be far too low. As of now, we expect attrition will cause 80-90% of projects to not be 
built. 
As often happens, there are those who may provide information speaking about cost concerns but 
it is equally important to balance that consideration with the anticipated beneﬁts. According toa 
2021 study by Daymark Energy Advisors3 , the NEB program is helping to stimulate our 
economy. Speciﬁcally, if we were to assume approximately 900 megawatts of NEB projects 
become operational, they are estimated to support 7,000 job-years and $782 million in economic 
activity in Maine. 
Lastly, We were glad to play an active role in the DG 2.0 stakeholder process led by the 
Governor ’s Energy Ofﬁce — and we look forward to being able to speak to those ideas in the 
weeks ahead to help design a successor program to build on the successes of NEB.- 
We respectfully urge you to vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you.
