This act allows for no credit to individual solar customers who send power to the grid.
Please do not pass it.  Maine has done well with its renewable energy progress.  If this
bill is passed we will return to the dark ages of energy with only commercial and 
institutional compensation. This cannot happen. Simply stated this is NOT FAIR, and 
would be a detrimental and devastating blow to solar customers who are working 
within the system to enhance renewable energy and diminish the use of fossil fuel.
