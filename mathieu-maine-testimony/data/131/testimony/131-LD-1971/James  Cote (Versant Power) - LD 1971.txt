 Testimony In Support of LD 1971 
 Resolve, To Help Certain Businesses with Electricity Costs 
May 24, 2023 
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the committee, my name is James Cote and 
I am here today on behalf of Versant Power in support of LD 1971.  
 
As you may recall, the Legislature passed LD 2010 during the last legislative session, which created the 
Energy Rate Relief Fund. The fund was used to provide rate relief to medium general service electricity 
customers to offset the significant increase in energy supply costs. 
 
Due to an unintentional consequence of a provision in the resolve, a small number of Versant Power 
customers who would have otherwise been eligible for the relief were not credited. This bill corrects 
that.  
 
The problematic language of LD 2010 is highlighted below: 
 
“Sec. 5.  Energy rate relief payment distribution. Resolved: That the department shall determine the 
amount of relief payments for covered utilities to credit to an eligible customer based on the number of 
kilowatt-hours billed by the covered utility to the customer on the February 2022 invoice in accordance 
with the following relief payment tiers:” 
 
This language unintentionally omitted a small group of otherwise eligible customers who did not 
receive invoices in February 2022.   
 
The changes proposed in LD 1971 provide for a narrow and explicit correction that will allow these 
customers to receive the relief that they would have otherwise been eligible for last year.  
 
We are aware that federal funding is available to accommodate this narrow subset of medium general 
service customers, and for these reasons, Versant Power supports this legislation and is eager to make 
this correction and deliver that relief to those customers.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
