RE: LD 1059, Reimbursement for Remote Ultrasound Procedures and Fetal 
Nonstress Tests Under MaineCare  
 
 
Dear Chairs and Members of the Committee,  
 
On behalf of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), I am writing 
to you in support of LD 1059, which allow for reimbursement for remote ultrasound 
procedures and fetal nonstress tests under MaineCare.  
 
AdvaMed is the largest medical technol ogy association, representing the innovators 
and manufacturers transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less 
invasive procedures, and more effective treatments. Our more than 450 members 
range from emerging companies to large multination als, and include traditional 
device, diagnostic, and digital health technology companies.  AdvaMed members are 
proud to have a footprint in Maine , where the med tech ind ustry generates $269.2 
million a year and sustains nearly 1,300 high paying jobs in the state.  
 
Millions of patients’ lives are improved every day because of advancements in 
medical technology. Medical technology companies strive to innovate and develop 
the best tools to diagnose and treat patients.  LD 1059 would increase access to 
specialized maternal health care for individuals  who are pregnant enrolled in 
MaineCare. Importantly, increasing this access would help reduce health disparities 
across a variety  of socio -economic populations in the state.

As repor ted by the March of Dimes , Maine’s struggles with maternal health and 
their 2022 report card gives Maine a C+. Families are less likely  to live in counties 
that don’t have access to maternal health care services. However, technology can 
now enable access t o tele -ultrasound, remote fetal nonstress tests, and remote 
patient monitoring, which means that pregnant individuals can receive important 
maternal care in their home or community – instead of driving long distances to 
access care. Subsequently, LD 1059 i s an important economic development 
measure that would enable businesses to offer families in Maine better access to 
healthcare when otherwise this choice may not be available.  
 
For these reasons, AdvaMed supports LD 1059 and we respectfully ask the 
commit tee to vote in support of the bill.  
 
 
Sincerely,
