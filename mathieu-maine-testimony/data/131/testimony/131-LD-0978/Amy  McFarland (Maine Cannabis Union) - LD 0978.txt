LD 978
Good Day Honorable Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. I am writing 
today in support LD# 978, 
"An Act to Maintain Legislative Oversight of the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Program by 
Requiring Major Substantive Rulemaking".
This bill extends Legislative oversight through most of 2025.
If the committee and the community sees fit, I suggest we extend that 2025 date further or 
even keep the date open ended. 
Thank you for your time,
Amy McFarland
President, Maine Cannabis Union
