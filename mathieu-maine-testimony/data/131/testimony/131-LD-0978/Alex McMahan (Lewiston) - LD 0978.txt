Subject: Support of LD 978
Iâ€™m here today to provide
support for LD 978.
This is a much needed bill, as it has become clear that all changes to the program should go
through the legislature. This bill is for the medical side of the industry, however I believe the
same requirement should be issued for the adult use sector as well. With all changes to the
program being required to go through the legislature, we can ensure that both cannabis
programs are regulated via a fair and inclusive process.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Respectfully,
Alex McMahan
