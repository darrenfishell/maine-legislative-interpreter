LD 978 An Act to Maintain Legislative Oversight of the Maine Medical Use of 
Cannabis Program by Requiring Major Substantive Rulemaking 
Good afternoon, honorable members of the veterans and legal affairs committee, 
My name is Samantha Brown, I am from South Berwick. My daughter has been a 
cannabis patient since she was two in 2013, and I have been advocating for cannabis 
freedom and access since. 
I support LD 978. 
In fact, the date should have never been adopted in the first place. Why would we pause the 
department’s authoritative power, then later give it back? 
Departments usually are equipped to make authoritative decisions without any 
accountability. The OCP is an example of that, as we have seen over the last few 
years. They were about to inflict tyrannical measures over the program, with zero 
accountability. They take a small verbiage in Statute and interpret that in a substantial 
tyrannical way. When program members call and ask them questions, they give 
different answers.  They need to be kept in check and things spelled out for them. 
People need protection from these governmental departments. Changing the the rules 
to major substantive was a step in the right direction, and saved many business from 
failing due to bureaucratic power.
I ask, please don’t give this power back to them and support LD 978. 
Thank you for your time.
