Testimony LD 1089 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I am Norman Higgins from 
Piscataquis County and served in the 127*“ , 128*“ and the 129"‘ Maine 
Legislature. 
I have been engaged for ﬁve decades in public education in Maine.l 
worked for 32 years in SAD #4 in Guilford as a teacher, principal and 
Supt. of Schools. I served for six years as the Director of the Center of 
Inquiry for Secondary Schools working with 33 high schools in Maine.I 
served four years as the Project Manager for School Consolidation in 
Maine. I have served as Vice Chair of the Council for Basic Education in 
Washington D.C and a member of the National Commission on Time 
and Learning. I have served the past twelve years as a Trustee of 
Foxcroft Academy. 
Today, I am testifying as Vice Chair of the Maine Charter School 
Commission. The Commission is in the process of having six new 
members appointed in less than one year. The Commission in the 
process of electing new leadership and recently completed a search for 
a new Executive Director. Collectively we bring a wealth of experience 
to our work to ensure that our charter schools are operating effectively 
LD 1089 would undermine the authority of the Commission to 
effectively meet its responsibilities outlined in public law. It would 
undermine the contractual relationship between the Commission and 
the schools. It would set a precedence that could infringe upon the 
work of other commissions. 
On behalf of the Charter School Commission we recommend ONTP on 
LD 1089. .
