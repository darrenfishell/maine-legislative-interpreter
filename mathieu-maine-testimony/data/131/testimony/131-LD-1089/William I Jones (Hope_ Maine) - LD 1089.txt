Members of the Education Committee,
I come to testify AGAINST LD #1089.
It is impossible to know what the consequences of this one-sentence bill would be
if, God forbid, it became law. One can only guess.
It is a shocking and undemocratic tradition of this committee to allow the substance
of bills to be introduced after citizens, ignorant of the final content of the bill, have
decided whether to testify or not. Even after they have testified.
