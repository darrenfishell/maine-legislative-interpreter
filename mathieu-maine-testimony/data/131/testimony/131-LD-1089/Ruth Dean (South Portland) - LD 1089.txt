LD 1089
LD 1089 would give one individual the power to overturn the decisions of Maine's 
bipartisan Charter Commission. It would give one individual the power to decide 
whether or not Maine charter school teachers and administrators shall remain 
employed. It would give one individual the power to decide whether or not charter 
school students can attend their chosen school. 
That is too much power for one person to hold.
LD 1089 Ought not to pass.
