Re: LD 1089 Public Hearing, An Act Regarding the Authorization of Public Charter Schools
Recommendation: Ought Not to Pass.
Honorable members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, I am Roger Brainerd, a 
retired teacher and principal from Rockland, and I am testifying against LD 1089.  
This bill would allow one person, a political appointee, to override the decision of a 
Commission comprised of seven experts from various relevant fields who have been 
appointed by the Governor and approved by the Legislature. Commission members are 
sworn to exercise legal due diligence in authorizing and overseeing public education options 
for students who choose public charter schools over their assigned district school. 
Many students enrolled in public charter schools, or joining a wait list hoping to be enrolled, 
do so because they are already at risk in their mental, physical, and/or academic health if 
they stay in their assigned school.
This partisan-sponsored, ill-conceived legislation is not only not necessary - it is part of an 
on-going political attempt to limit and eliminate any public charter school competition to 
district public schools - at a critical time many students and their families are desperate for 
new, affordable public school options.
As you have important issues to consider, please waste little time on LD 1084 and vote Ought
Not to Pass.
Thank You
