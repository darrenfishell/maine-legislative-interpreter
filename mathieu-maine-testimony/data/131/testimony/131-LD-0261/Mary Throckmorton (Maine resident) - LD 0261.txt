In Favor of LD 261
There are laws on the books in Maine that prevent residents under the age of 16 from 
using knives and mechanical slicers at a place of business, yet somehow a three year 
old is allowed to wield a firearm in the act of taking life under the guise of "hunting".
The idea that this is ok because it is teaching "survival skills" or is "tradition" is 
unacceptable. The blunt truth is that if there were circumstances that required the use 
of hunting for survival, (some sort of apocalyptic event) in short order anything in the 
woods would be eradicated. 
Which is why "recreational" hunting has laws and bag limits to protect animals from 
being eradicated.
Young children can still be taught woodscraft, how to plant and tend a garden and/or 
domestic livestock, how to handle a firearm in a safe environment such as a shooting 
range and competitions. To insist that they need to learn the lust for killing at a tender 
age is abhorrent and a detriment to society as a whole.
Please support reinstating a minimum age for hunting, thank you.
