Honorable Committee Members of Maine's IF&W Dept:
OPPOSE LD 261  *As written*
 I advocate for youth hunting but not under the age of twelve. 
I was appalled when several years ago I learned that a child of any age could posses a 
Maine hunting license. The fact that this child must be accompanied by an adult was 
cold comfort.
For many years, I accompanied my father and husband in deer hunting and bird 
hunting. I am no stranger to the hunting community, our woods, waters and wildlife.  
What I know for sure is: There are responsible adults that hunt and irresponsible 
adults. And the comprehension of "Actions/Consequences" of a six year old vs. a 
twelve-year-old's is significant.  
I personally believe the majority of Maine landowners and citizens  would not oppose
a 6 year old accompanying an adult as they hunted. However, they would be troubled 
to learn that a six year old would be in possession of, and  firing the rifle.
How "A Child of Any Age" law, even got on the books is troubling. A need to 
artificially inflate license sales numbers appears to be the obvious reason.  That 
concerns me as far as ethics goes. How could that not be seen as a bizarre means of 
garnering monetary compensation for decreasing license-sale numbers ?
Let's get back to common sense and teamwork to work out our problems in areas of 
concern. Balance. It's important for both the hunting and non-hunting community.
Thank you.
