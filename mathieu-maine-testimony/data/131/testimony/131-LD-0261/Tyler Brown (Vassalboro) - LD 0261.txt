LD 261
Dear respected members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Legislative Committee,
My name is Tyler Brown and I am testifying today in opposition to LD 261, An Act 
to Reinstate a Minimum Age for Hunting.
Maine has a generational hunting tradition, with multiple generations of families 
engaging in the sport. Statistically, hunting is one of the safest recreational activities a
person can engage in and Maine itself is one of the safest states in the country to 
engage in hunting. Participation at a young age is one of the greatest factors for hunter
recruitment and retention. Maine's own lifetime license program has the lowest fee for
birth to 5 year old's. This legislation would nullify the benefits of such a program by 
prohibiting lifetime license holders under the age of 5 from utilizing their license to 
its fullest extent. 
Maine law already has safeguards in place for youth hunters, with any hunter under 
the age of 10 required to have an adult hunter with them at all times. This legislation 
is unnecessary as there has been no documented hunting incident involving a hunter 
under the age of 5. This legislation would seriously hinder hunting opportunities for 
youth and families to engage in this generational tradition. Maine parents, families 
and guardians are the best individuals to asses the competency and experience level of
their youth hunters to engage in this traditional activity. A youth hunters at the age of 
4 years, 11 months at the start of their chosen hunting season should not be excluded 
from engaging in hunting. 
I highly encourage you to vote ought not to pass on this unnecessary and prohibitive 
legislation that would only serve as a detriment to hunting tradition in Maine.
Thank you for your time in reading my testimony and your service to our state.
Tyler Brown
