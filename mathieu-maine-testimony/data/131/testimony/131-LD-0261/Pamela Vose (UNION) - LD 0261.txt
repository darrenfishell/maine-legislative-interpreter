LD 261
I am writing to oppose LD 261 - An Act to Reinstate a Minimum Age for Hunting as 
it is currently written.
Although I am not opposed to young hunters, I do not support hunting licenses and 
the ability to carry and shoot a weapon for the purpose of hunting for anyone under 
the age of twelve.
