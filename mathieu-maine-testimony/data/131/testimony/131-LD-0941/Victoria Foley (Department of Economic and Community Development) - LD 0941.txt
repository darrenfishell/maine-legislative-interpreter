Testimony of Victoria Foley 
Neither for nor against LD 941 
An Act Facilitating the Efforts of the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority and the 
Town of Brunswick to Design and Carry Out Improvements to the Storm Water System 
and Other Infrastructure at the Former Brunswick Naval Air Station 
Good afternoon, Sen. Curry, Rep. Roberts, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
lmiovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. I am Victoria Foley, legislative 
liaison for the Department of Economic and Community Development, and I am testifying neither 
for nor against LD 941. 
Since the bill was printed, we have had a good conversation with the bill sponsor. Based on that 
discussion, we understand that there will be an amendment to the concept draft that seeks to create 
a commission focused on some of the infrastructure concerns identiﬁed in the current bill title. 
DECD would be pleased to have a staff person participate on the cormnission as it has been 
described to us, and happy to be helpful in whatever ways we are able in terms of expertise— 
though stormwater management is not our strength. We have spoken with our colleagues at DEP 
and they share our position on this bill. A member of DEP’s Stormwater Engineering Team could 
serve on the commission as well. 
Thank you for your time, and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
