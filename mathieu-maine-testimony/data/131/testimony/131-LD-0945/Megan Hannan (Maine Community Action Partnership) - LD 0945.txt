207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 945 An Act to 
Allow Maine Families to Increase Their Savings by Removing Asset 
Limits for Eligibility for the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Program 
April 18, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Seniices, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership and we support LD 945 An Act 
to Allow Maine Families to Increase Their Savings by Removing Asset 
Limits for Eligibility for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
Program. 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state's policies 
shape people’s possibilities. In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a family’s capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the family’s well-being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success. 
As these families fulﬁll their promise and make more money, which they 
do, many of the necessary supports that have been there to help them to 
be safely housed, fed well and healthy fall out. You all know about the 
so-called Cliff Effect. It can be devastating to be working hard, enjoying 
yourjob and your children just to have to say "No” to a better job for fear 
of losing those supports. LD 945 will not end this threat altogether, but it 
will allow families to save some money for when they need it. All families 
need it at some point; some of us are lucky enough to have savings to 
fall back on. Although not all; certainly too few families have enough 
savings for even a single car repair. 
Removing the asset test in TANF and allowing families to save some 
money is the right thing to do. When those families are ready to leave 
TANF it will be safer for them to do so. The economic security of some 
savings adds to the family's well-being, social, emotional and economic 
health — when this is the result, the program has worked as it was 
originally intended. It was created to support families and to build social 
capital, not to punish families. 
Thank you for taking this step to support the goals of families leaving 
TANF better than they found it.
