Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services. My name is Moriah Geer, I use she/her pronouns, and I am a policy 
advocate at Maine Equal Justice. MEI is a nonprofit civil legal aid organization working to 
increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak with you in support of LD 945 “An Act to Allow Maine Families to Increase 
Their Savings by Removing Asset Limits for Eligibility for the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Program. ” 
At MEJ we work with people who need to make use of public benefits programs from time to 
time, and we work with them to find ways to improve programs and make them work better. 
I've had the privilege of working with an incredible team of low-income people who have either 
been on or are still on TANF, called the ASPIRE leadership team, and that group chose the 
removal of asset limits as a priority for this legislative session. I am here today representing 
their voices and the voices of the hundreds of other TANF parents that I have worked with 
during my time at MEI. 
As of right now if you are a parent with low to no income you cannot have more than $2000 in 
"countable" assets or you will be denied assistance from the TANF program. This means that ifa 
parent worked hard and was able to put money into savings, but then lost theirjob, they will 
have to spend down that savings before they can receive any assistance from TANF. Then, when 
they are able to go back to work, they will have little savings to pull from in the case of an 
unexpected emergency. Likewise, a parent who receives TANF can't save funds to provide their 
family with any sort of cushion for when they start working and leave TANF. In either of these 
instances an unexpected expense, like needing to replace an unrepairable car or needing to find 
a new apartment with little notice, could cause instability that leads to losing a job and ending 
up back in a situation where they again need assistance from TANF to meet their family's needs. 
I have worked with families in both of these situations and I have seen firsthand how 
devastating the effects can be. 
Another real-life example of how asset limits harm families is exemplified by a family thatI 
worked with recently that lives in Washburn, in Aroostook County. Under the current asset rules 
a family is allowed to have one car that is exempt from the S2000 limit. In this case both mom 
and dad were attending classes in Presque Isle, and mom was working on campus as well. 
Presque Isle is about a 40-minute drive from their home. It's impossible for mom and dad to 
have the same class and work schedule so that they can always commute together, and they 
also have 4 young children who need to be picked up from daycare at specific times. They 
clearly need two cars, but under the current asset limit, their second vehicle must be worth less
2 
than $2000. Unfortunately, such vehicles are prone to chronic issues and breakdowns needing 
repairs that far exceed the car repair funds allotted to them under the TANF/ASPIRE program. 
Eventually the second car was no longer repairable and dad had to drop out of school. 
Removing the asset limit on TANF would have allowed stories like this to play out differently. It 
would also save the state a lot of time and money on the administration of the program. The 
current asset rules are long, complicated and cumbersome. It is well established that asset 
limits are difficult for states to administer and notoriously prone to error.1 These errors leave 
families at risk of losing income they badly need to meet their basic needs,2 which none of us 
wants to see. 
States have the authority under federal law to set their own asset limit, including eliminating it. 
As ofluly 2020, eight states - Alabama, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, and 
Virginia? ’ - had eliminated asset limits in their TANF programs and seen positive results. The 
elimination of an asset limit removes administrative burden on eligibility workers and the State 
while also removing administrative red tape for families who are struggling to make ends meet. 
Finally, we all know that savings are essential to building financial security and being prepared 
to weather unexpected crises as well as larger economic disruptions. A study from the Urban 
Institute found that low-income families who have built $2000 - $4,999 in savings are less likely 
to suffer a hardship due to an income disruption than a middle-income family without any 
savings. “ A car that isn't fixable, a broken water heater, an unexpected eviction, increased 
heating oil costs, a job loss - these are just some of the examples of the types of disruptions that 
can cause a family to spiral into homelessness, unemployment, and financial instability if they 
don't have adequate savings to weather the financial challenges life throws at all of us. 
Asset limits place unnecessary barriers for Maine families in need of assistance and that isn't 
what any of us want. I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 945 so that Maine families can have 
more of a chance to achieve their goals and to thrive.
