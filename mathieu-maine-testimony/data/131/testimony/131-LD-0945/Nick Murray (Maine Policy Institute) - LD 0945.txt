Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
945:
“An
Act
to
Allow
Maine
Families
to
Increase
Their
Savings
by
Removing
Asset
Limits
for
Eligibility
for
the
Temporary
Assistance
for
Needy
Families
Program”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
945.
This
bill
is
marketed
as
a
way
for
families
to
“increase
their
savings”
by
allowing
anyone
to
access
TANF,
a
welfare
program
designed
for
the
most
needy.
In
reality,
it
would
distort
the
program’s
intent
by
reckless
expanding
it
beyond
the
original
intent.
LD
945
is
an
insult
to
those
who
actually
need
state
assistance
to
get
by.
By
sponsoring
this
bill
and
titling
it
in
this
way,
the
sponsor
has
made
her
intent
clear:
not
to
free
Mainers
from
the
dependence
that
subsisting
on
TANF
may
engender,
but
the
exact
opposite.
Passage
of
LD
945
would
signal
an
era
where
public
benefits
are
no
longer
a
temporary
measure
used
to
help
our
neighbors
get
back
on
their
feet,
but
a
way
for
politicians
to
virtue-signal
by
treating
the
majority
of
their
constituents
as
perpetually
poor.
By
claiming
that
obliterating
means
testing
TANF
will
increase
the
savings
of
the
Mainers
who
use
it
blatantly
ignores
those
who
will
be
forced
to
fund
it.
Have
we
forgotten
about
the
Mainers
who
pay
taxes?
Their
savings
will
not
increase.
Inflation
and
our
state’s
crippling
taxation
regime
will
continue
to
eat
away
at
their
hard-earned
savings.
Per
usual,
they
will
be
the
ones
on
the
hook
for
the
costs
of
this
cynical
proposal.
Please
deem
LD
945
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
maintain
the
current
simple
and
effective
asset
limitations
for
Mainers
receiving
public
funds
via
TANF.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
