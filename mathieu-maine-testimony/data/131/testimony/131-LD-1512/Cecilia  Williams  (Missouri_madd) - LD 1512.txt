In 2021 I created a bill called Bentley's Law ,it's been my hope to see this bill go 
nationwide, I created this after my son Cordell and daughter in law Lacey and 
4-month-old grandson Cordell the second were killed by a drunk driver. It passed in 
Tennessee in 2022 and Kentucky this year. Maines version of the bill is set for public 
hearing and I would like the opportunity to testify By zoom on behalf of the bill.
