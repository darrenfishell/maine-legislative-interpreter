T estimony of Representative Holly B. Stover presenting 
LD 1512, An Act to Require Restitution for a Child Whose Parent Is Killed by a Drunk 
Driver 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judlczaiy 
Good aftemoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and esteemed members of the 
Judiciary Committee I am Holly Stover, and I proudly represent the Towns of Boothbay, 
Boothbay Harbor, Edgecomb, Southport, South Bnstol and Westport Island I'am here to present 
LD 1512, An Act to Require Restitution for a Child Whose Parent Is Killed by a Drunk Drzver 
LD 1512 would require intoxicated dnvers who kill the parent(s) of a minor(s) to pay a court- 
detennined amount of restitution until the child 1S 18 years old and graduates high school The 
restitution would be determined based on the needs of the minor(s) and aligned with the standard 
of living they were accustomed to prior to losing their parent(s) This is a similar calculation 
used by our courts in establishing child support provided by a noncustodial parent in a child 
custody arrangement Additionally, this legislation would ensure that any restitution awarded toa 
minor(s) would be offset by any civil action also awarded in the case 
Nathan McLaughlin, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System Analyst with the Highway Safety 
Coordinator at the Maine Department of Public Safety, reports that as of today, 41 fatalities in 
2022 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 08 Additionally, there were eight 
fatalities with a BAC greater than zero but less than O8, not meeting the legal deÔ¨Ånition of drunk 
driving in this state In 2022, Maine had 172 fatal crashes resulting in 183 fatalities Of those 183 
fatalities, 41 of the drivers had a BAC greater than 08, representing 22% of all vehicular 
fatalities in 2022 I would caution that this data 1S still considered prelnninaiy as Maine 
Department of Public Safety continues to receive this information for the 2022 fatalities Despite 
all the efforts to stop these crimes, drunk driving remains a serious problem in Maine 
LD 1512 would ensure additional Justice for the victims of drunk driving and a greater 
demonstration of accountability for the drivers convicted of these crimes Driving is not a right, 
it is not a privilege My hope is that this legislation will make drivers think twice before getting 
behind the wheel of a car when they are impaired But if a person chooses to drive when 
impaired and kills a parent(s), that driver will face an additional consequence for that imfortunate
