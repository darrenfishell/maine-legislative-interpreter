Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
I suspect this bill is to put in place an agency to replace the PUC and is a prelude to an
anticipated takeover of the two biggest investor-owned electric utilities in Maine.
What this "concept" bill will do is add another layer of active sabotage of an energy 
system so vital to the daily lives of Maine citizens.
With an agency proposed in this bill, what would be in the way to stop or slow down 
electric costs to the ratepayers? 
Adding another agency is crazy. Every agency that has originated or has involved 
joint participation from this committee has exploded electricity costs. 
Do not table this bill. Throw this bill under the table.
If the committee wants to withdraw from ISO-NE, then a replacement grid operator 
could easily be developed from existing utilities
