(Iurrently, the Utitice of the l’uhlic .t\d\'ocate coordinates the i\l\X7;\ review among the

One ot the ongoing challenges \vith the lS( ) wlioleszile market" paradigm is that the 
consumer is largely left out of the decision making process. lhere is vet)" little attention paid 
to 2Ll?i_ <)t‘LlZll)lliI§' . Consumers and <>i"gztiiiz;1ti<>ris representing their interests do not have the 
engineering expertise to challenge proposals from well financed, tor proﬁt businesses such as 
utilities and energy generators. Similarly, creating a mini lS() in .\laine Focused on system 
integration may lead to o\'erl>uilding and liighet rates tor ratepayers if the interests of

utilities and the vztrious government agencies to deflect responsibility for any had outcomes
