LD 117
Dear Committee Members,  
I am writing in reference to LD 117 ~ The Summary states ~ This bill provides that benefits 
received through the electronic benefits transfer system may only be redeemed through 
purchase by electronic transfer and may not be redeemed for cash. 
    I am in complete agreement with this bill.  Welfare fraud is so very costly to hard working, 
tax paying Mainers.  We need welfare reform NOW.  This is not a Republican issue, but a 
Maine issue. Where are the common sense approaches Mainer's are longing for? We should 
not have to wait for Republicans to be in majority to deal with welfare abuse or fraud. No 
matter what party you are in, you should care for all of us, since you have been elected to 
serve all of the people in your districts. 
     LD 117 is about solving a problem with a common sense approach. Most working Mainers 
live on very tight budgets, and cannot afford to spend unwisely.  I have an example, if you 
want to see how some of the welfare fraud is happening, take a field trip to nail salons any 
time of day or evenings, and observe, who are getting mani/pedi's and talking loudly on their 
state of the art cell phones, sometimes about upcoming parties, bad boyfriends/baby daddy's,
or the next tattoo appointment they have. I've had the privilege of having a pedicure twice 
after a hip replacement, cause i could not do it myself.
  I have no problem with anyone being able to enjoy these if they choose to, but i am highly 
opposed to it, happening on my dime or should i say dollar! Please stop allowing welfare 
fraud.  You have an opportunity to use your common sense and vote in support of LD 117 for 
the benefit of all Maine tax payers. This bill should garner bi-partisan support! Vote ought to 
pass on LD 117
Sincerely and Respectfully,
Renee Fortin
