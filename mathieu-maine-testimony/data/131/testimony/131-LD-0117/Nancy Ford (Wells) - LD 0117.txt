LD 117
I am writing in support of  LD117 An Act to Prohibit the Use of Electronic Benefits Transfer 
System Cards for Cash Withdrawal
When I donate or give money to any person, cause, institution or even a family member, no 
matter how worthy or in need that person or cause is, I have the expectation that the money I 
give will be used for the purpose intended. Quite simply, I believe I have the same right to 
expect that the State of Maine and those who represent me in the legislature will make every 
effort to make sure that my tax dollars, whether disbursed for highways or EBT cards, is used 
for the intended purpose of building or maintaining a road or buying necessities of life. 
A contractor for Maine would certainly be held accountable for skimming off some funds for a 
trip, alcohol, or drugs, and an audit of their records could determine that. In the case of using 
EBT cards to get cash at an ATM, however, there are no records to audit, there is no way to 
determine how that fungible cash is spent, and therefore no way of knowing whether my tax 
dollars and those of all Mainers are being spent for the purpose intended. 
All LD 117 does is to hold the State of Maine responsible for the proper use of our tax dollars 
by making sure that every tax dollar is spent for its intended purpose, whether to build a 
highway or to help a person or family in need to obtain necessities of life. 
EBT cards are intended to be used in certain types of stores for certain types of goods, not to 
become cash at the nearest ATM. If the State of Maine wants to hand out cash on the steps 
of the Capitol, then pass legislation to do that,  but do not make an end run around that type 
of reckless legislation by continuing to allow EBT cards to be turned into that same 
untraceable cash. 
All I expect in return for paying my taxes is that the State of Maine be fiscally responsible in 
how and to whom this money is disbursed and monitor whether or not it is used for its 
intended purpose. Dispersing cash through a corner ATM most certainly does not meet the 
criteria of monitoring where the heck our money goes when it leaves Augusta.
