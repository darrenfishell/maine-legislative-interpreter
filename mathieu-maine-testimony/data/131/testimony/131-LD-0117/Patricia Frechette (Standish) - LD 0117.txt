You need to be REMINDED that this $$ you earmarked  for EBT, comes from hard working 
MAINERS for helping other MAINERS who are in dire need of help for FOOD.   There are 
other programs available for rent assistance.  Food assistance should also be limited 
depending on family size and income and it should not be a lifetime freebie.  
These are hard times, and we need to help each other, but being able to use this card 
out-of-state or for anything else other than FOOD is a slap in the face of all Mainers who work
and pay taxes to the State of Maine Governor and Legislature who wastes so much of this $$ 
on unnecessary and frivolous expenditures.  Time to tighten the belt!!  I have to.
