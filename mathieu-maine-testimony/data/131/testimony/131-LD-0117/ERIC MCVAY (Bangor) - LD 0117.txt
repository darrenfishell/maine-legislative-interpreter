LD 117
Dear Members of the Health and human services committee this is Eric McVay and 
I,am here to testify in oppisitition to LD 117 an act to prohibit the use of EBT cards to
make Cash withdrawals  and the issue with this bill is that DHHS recently began 
depostiting money into the accounts of those who are eleigable for EBT cards and if 
this bill were to pass it would mean that we would not be able to withdraw money 
from our accounts
