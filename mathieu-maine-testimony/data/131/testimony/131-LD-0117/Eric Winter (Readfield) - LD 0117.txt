LD 117
I am writing in support of LD 117 - An Act to Prohibit the Use of Electronic Benefits Transfer 
System Cards for Cash Withdrawals.
We have poor citizens in our state, and it is crucial that our help reaches them.
The funds for those programs are finite, and it is also crucial that the funds are used only for 
their intended purposes.  This is a sound, moderate measure.  Though it may cause pain or 
inconvenience in a very small percentage of cases, it is a just and essential step toward 
ensuring appropriate use of our state's resources.
