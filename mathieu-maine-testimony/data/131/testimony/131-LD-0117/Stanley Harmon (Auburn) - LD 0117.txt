The use of funds that appear to be intended for welfare needs that then become used 
in vacation spots or converted to cash is an inappropriate use of funds that in one way 
or another I have helped to provide via taxes needs to stop immediately.   On the face 
it really appears this misuse of this money is an attempt to garner support  of certain 
politicians who support this practice while disregarding the real help and welfare of 
the participants.  Sad at the least and most likely evil in its intent.
