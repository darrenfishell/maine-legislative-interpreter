Thank you for the opportunity to comment on LD117.
LD 117 ensures that the benefits provided on EBT cards cannot be redeemed for cash.
Cash can be spent anywhere, on anything, from illegal drugs to alcohol.  Taxpayers 
shouldn't be funding anything but basic necessities for people, especially the elderly 
and children, who are going through tough times and cannot make ends meet. That's 
the definition of welfare.
