To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services
Regarding L.D. 117,
An Act to Prohibit the Use of Electronic Benefits Transfer 
System Cards for Cash Withdrawals
February 15, 2023
Sen. Baldacci, Rep. Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.  I’m Penny Morrell, taxpayer 
and citizen of the Town of Belgrade, Maine. 
I support LD 117, An Act to Prohibit the Use of Electronic Benefits Transfer System Cards 
for Cash Withdrawals, and thank Senator Brakey for sponsoring it.
It’s unfathomable to me that the law in Maine would allow anyone with an EBT card to 
withdraw cash at an ATM.  The law expressly prevents owners of these cards to use them 
for illicit purposes and purchases are monitored in order to assure proper use.  Yet 
withdrawals for cash are also permitted.  Where is the accountability for the purchases 
made with the cash?
EBT cards should only be used for those who are down and out for short periods of time 
to help them get on their feet.  Everywhere you look there are signs out needing to hire 
help.  Why aren’t these cardholders taking these jobs instead of staying on the system?  I 
saw one sign so desperate for help it said words to the effect: “If you can walk and 
breathe, you’re hired!”  (my paraphrase).
Lets be honest, get undeserving off TANF, use it for only those most needy for a short 
time to help them while they start to earn a living, and stop the flaw in this law allowing 
cash withdrawals.  
I ask this committee to vote “ought to pass” on LD. 117.
