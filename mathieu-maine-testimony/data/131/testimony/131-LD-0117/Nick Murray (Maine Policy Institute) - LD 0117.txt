Testimony in Support of LD 117:
“An Act to Prohibit the Use of Electronic Benefits Transfer System Cards for Cash
Withdrawals”
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as
director of policy for Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a
nonpartisan, non-profit organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic
freedom in Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 117.
LD 117 is a common sense bill that would ensure recipients of public assistance
are not abusing a system meant to provide food and basic necessities. This is purely an
issue of fairness. If some are withdrawing cash from their EBT cards for fraudulent or
illicit purchases, it is not fair to the taxpayer or to those who use their benefits
appropriately.
Currently, the only establishments where use of EBT cards are explicitly
prohibited are gambling locations, those which earn more than 50% of gross revenue
from selling liquor, or those which “provide adult-oriented entertainment in which
performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment.” There are no
other restrictions on EBT usage.

ATM cash withdrawals
are an enormous loophole
around these basic restrictions.
State welfare benefits should truly be a safety net, meant for those who are
struggling and need a hand-up. These programs should spur individuals to become
independent; unfortunately, they tend to become handouts and trap individuals in a
toxic cycle of dependence on the state.
These programs should also be held to the highest standards of accountability,
not only because they are funded by those who work, but because their intent is to feed
the hungry and clothe the bare. The Legislature should work to secure this noble cause
by providing stronger safeguards against inappropriate use of EBT cards and assistance
benefits broadly.
Please deem LD 117 “Ought To Pass” and contribute to a more fair and
transparent welfare system to serve Mainers who need it most. Thank you for your time
and consideration.
