Dear Chairs and Committee members,  
I am writing in support of two bills LD's 43 and 622
LD 43
An Act to Reduce the Cost of Electricity by Removing the 100-megawatt Limit on Renewable 
Resources of Energy   - Senator Timberlake of Androscoggin
LD 622
An Act to Create Equal Opportunity Access to Clean Energy by Removing the 100-megawatt 
Limit on Clean Energy Sources  - Representative Ardell of Monticello
The point of these two bills are, reducing the cost of electricity, and creating equal opportunity
access to clean energy.
These are both a win win situation for the people of Maine, who are struggling to makes ends 
meet, and low cost energy would be a huge relief! I highly encourage an ought to pass vote 
on each bill, LD 43 and LD 622
Thank you 
Renee Fortin
