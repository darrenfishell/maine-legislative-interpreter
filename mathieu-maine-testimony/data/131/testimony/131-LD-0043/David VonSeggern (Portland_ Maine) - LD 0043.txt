LD 43
Honorable Members of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee:
I am testifying on LD43 (and its companion bill LD622).  I am a Maine resident and a
retired earth scientist with considerable background in energy issues.  
LD43 would remove the 100 MW limit on using various power sources to meet the 
state’s defined goals on renewable energy for Maine’s electricity market.  I strongly 
urge that “Hydroelectric generators” be removed from the list of allowed generators.  
Maine currently has no hydroelectric plants greater than 100 MW and the last one 
went online in 1997 according to the USGS National Inventory of Dams (NID) 
database.  There are good reasons for this.  Dams interrupt the natural flow of 
streams, preventing fish spawning; and Maine has been removing dams in the past 
few decades for this reason.  The impounded water bodies behind dams are coming 
under more scrutiny as emitters of carbon dioxide and methane and therefore run 
counter to Maine’s attempts to reach a zero carbon budget.  Allowing greater than 100
MW hydroelectric sources to qualify as renewable energy sources would simply 
create more problems than it solves.
