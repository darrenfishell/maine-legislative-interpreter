RE: LD43 
An Act to Reduce the Cost of Electricity by Removing the 100- megawatt Limit on Renewable 
Resources of Energy 
 
Chairman Lawrence, Zeigler and Committee members, my name is James LaBrecque and I’m from 
Bangor. 
I am in favor of LD43 for the following reasons. 
That law was put in place by democrats to protect solar and wind special interest, it does not protect the 
interest of the rate payers. 
The restriction imposed that this bill seeks to remove is contrary to the intent of the deregulation law 
passed in 1997. 
That restriction has been harmful to energy competitors and costly to ratepayers and must be removed. 
Below is an example of the benefit of just 100MW of imported hydro power has on the people of Maine 
when used to reduce our demand on oil by using hydro power to run heat pumps. 
 
Thank you

100MW  hydro  line at 100%  capacity  factor  produces  about  38% of the total energy  generated  by all Maine’s  
installed  wind capacity  to date,  but unlike  wind or solar,  hydro  is base  load production  quality.

Adding  this scale  of renewable  hydro  energy  to Maine’s  resource  inventory  will have  a major  impact  on REC’s  
and a competitive  impact  on generation.  
  
For every  $2.00  in a gallon  of oil that leaves  this state,  Maine  loses  $19.25/MMBtu  when  figuring  that the 
majority  of our old stock  of heating  systems  deliver  around  75% of the oil used  is in the form of useful  heat,  the 
other  25% of the heat goes  up the chimney  and in the cellar.  The $19.25/MMBtu  does  not include  the electricity  
to run furnaces.

For every  6 cents/kWh  that leaves  Maine  to go to Canada  for clean  hydro  power  to run heat pumps,  Maine  
loses  $5.86/MMBtu.  This does  not account  for the fact that homes  with heat pumps  also use less heat because  
of the local/spot  heating  characteristics,  whereas  central  heating  systems  provides  more  uniform  heat 
throughout  the home  which  requires  more  energy.

For every  MMBtu’s  from Canadian  hydro  running  heat pumps  that displaces  oil, Maine  keeps  $13.39  from 
leaving  Maine’s  economy.  ($19.25  - $5.86  = $13.39)  
  
100MW  hydroelectric  production  for a year with a COP  of 3 at $13.39  savings/MMBtu  comes  up to $120M/year.  
This $120M  stays  in Maine’s  economy  instead  of ending  up in the pockets  of out of state  oil companies.

100MW  hydroelectric  production  for a year with a COP  of 3 will displace  86 million  gallons  of oil when  using  
75% average  oil efficient  heating  systems.

Using  the 100MW  hydro  power  limit to run heat pumps  will save  Maine  $259M/year.  ($3.00/gallon,  86.3 million

100MW  hydroelectric  production  for a year running  heat pumps  with a COP  of 3 will reduce  Maine’s  CO2 by 
1.9 billion  Lbs./year  whereas  our total installed  wind capacity  of 930.6MW  to date saves  1.6 billion  Lbs. of 
CO2/year.  (This  is based  on N.E. average  CO2/MW  not Maine  which  would  look even  better  for hydro  driven  
heat pumps)

To prevent  $121M/year  from leaving  the state  in exchange  for oil imports,  and to save  $259M/year  in reducing  
heating  oil use, and to reduce  Maine’s  carbon  footprint  by 1.9 billion  Lbs./year,  Maine  would  have  to invest  in 
219,000  1-ton  heat pumps  at an install  cost of $680M.  Maine  is already  about  1/3 of the way to that number  
and will need  clean  hydro  to provide  the energy  for those  heat pump  resources.  
  
Investing $680M in heat pumps, saves 1.9 billion Lbs. CO2/year 
  
Investing $1.6B in wind, saves 1.6 billion Lbs. CO2/year 
  
Investing $4.8B in solar would also save 1.6 billion Lbs. CO2/year
