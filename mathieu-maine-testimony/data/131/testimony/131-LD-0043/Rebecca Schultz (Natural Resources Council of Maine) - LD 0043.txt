 An Act to Reduce the Cost of Electricity by Removing the 100 -megawatt Limit on Renewable Resources 
of Energy ; and An Act to Create Equal Opportunity Access to Clean Energy by Removing the 100 -
megawatt Limit on Clean Energy Sources

Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Joint Committee on Energy, Utilities and 
Technology , my name is Rebecca Schultz. I am a S enior Advocate for Climate and Clean Energy at the 
Natural Resources Council of Maine  (NRCM). NRCM  has been  working  for more  than  60 years  to protect,  
restore,  and conserve  Maine’s  environment,  on behalf  of our 25,000 members  and supporters .  
 I am  here today to  testify  in opposition to LD 43 and LD 622 , which are identical bills proposing to 
modify  Maine’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) by eliminat ing the 100 MW cap on eligibility .
1   
 
NRCM  has been a l ongstanding supporter of Maine’s RPS , and we have testified in opposition to similar 
legislation aiming to eliminate the 100 MW cap in the past (e.g., 2014, 2015) . Today we oppose  lifting 
the 100 MW limit  for similar reasons:  
 
• It would provide no significant benefits to ratepayers ;  
• It would not inc rease production of renewable energy ; and  
• It would risk undermining the progress we ’ve made  to date  in growing Maine ’s clean energy 
economy . 
 Most states have an RPS  program .
2 And l ike most states , the purpose of Maine’s RPS is to stimulate 
market demand for new investments in renewable energy  and diversify the electricity portfolio to 
transition away from a  costly reliance on fossil fuels.  Lifting the 100 MW cap  would directly undermine 
these purposes.  
 What the proposed change would effectively do is allow Canadian hydroelectric dams  to qualify for 
Maine’s  RPS, causing financial benefits to flow north of the border to their owner: Hydro -Quebec . 
Hydro -Quebec is a large, government -backed foreign utility  that owns a network of massive hydro power 
projects . It posted  $3.4 billion  in profit s in 2022, a 28 percent j ump from the prior year due to  selling 
electricity in the U.S. at elevated prices , driven higher by the natural gas crisis in Europe .

has not and will not provide below market power to Maine. It does not need to receive benefits from 
Maine ratepayers, and Maine’s economy would not benefit from providing them.  
 
These bills would shift ratepayer support for renewables to  Canada and correspondingly reduce those 
incentives for Maine -based energy  producers . Maine’s RPS, along with the RPS programs of other New  
England states , has  created tens of thousands of jobs in Maine and added billions to the state economy.4 
What purpose does it serve to diminish Maine’s RPS program and shift those  incentives  away from the 
state econom y by allowing large -scale, foreign hydropower to qualify ?  
 
Furthermore, d oing so  would do nothing to improve reliability. O ver the recent Christmas  holiday , for 
example, the New England grid faced an emergency power shortfall due in part to the fact that H ydro -
Quebec cut electricity destined for the U.S. because of extreme cold  and storm outages on the Canad ian 
side of the border .5 Increasing our reliance on Canadian  hydro imports would  only increase this 
vulnerability.   
 
To conclude, NRCM  opposes these bills on the basis that removing the 100 MW limit would  directly 
undermine the statutory  purpose of Maine’s RPS  to support in -state renewable energy development 
and strengthen our power supply through diversification.  We urge you to vote Ought Not To Pass on this 
bill as this committee has done in the past.  
 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony .
