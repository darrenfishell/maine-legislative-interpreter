Re: Testimony not in Support of LD 43, An Act to Reduce the Cost of Electricity by 
Removing the 100-megawatt Limit on Renewable Resources of Energy  nor the 
companion bill, LD 622, An Act to Create Equal Opportunity Access to Clean Energy
by Removing the 100-megawatt Limit on Clean Energy Sources  
Senate Chair Lawrence, House Chair Zeigler, and members of the Committee on 
Energy, Utilities, and Technology,
My name is Celeste Carey. I live in Newcastle. I cannot support LD 43. I cannot 
support LD 622. I care very much about addressing climate change and support our 
efforts to reduce the greenhouse gases which are accelerating environmental harm to 
our State, the Gulf of Maine, and our planet.
Developing and expanding 100 megawatt hydropower generation is not a good idea. 
We know more now about dams than we once did. Hydropower reservoirs often 
release greenhouse gases, which is something we don't want to do. Methane, another 
heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but eighty times as potent as carbon dioxide, is also 
released. While there is no free lunch, as Senator Angus King says, when it comes to 
energy, the science we have today shows that we need to look to renewables like 
off-shore wind and solar energy which appear to have fewer issues.
If you would amend the bills and withdraw hydropower generation from your list, 
then I could be in support of the legislation.
Thank you for considering my testimony.
