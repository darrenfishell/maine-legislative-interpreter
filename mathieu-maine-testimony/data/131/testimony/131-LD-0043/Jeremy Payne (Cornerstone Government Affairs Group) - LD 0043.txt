Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify in opposition to LDs 43 and 622 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable 
Energy Association (“MREA”). 
For many years the idea of removing the so-called “100 megawatt cap” has come before this 
committee and has been repeatedly rejected primarily for four reasons: 
1) It would run counter to the long-standing intent of Maine’s Renewable Portfolio Standard 
(“RPS”), which is to incent as much in~state (or at least in-region) clean energy 
development as possible to help diversity our energy mix, reduce environmental impacts, 
and to encourage investment and the creation of new jobs; 
2) Today’s RPS in Maine — in combination with those of other New England states — has led 
to signiﬁcant investment by MREA member companies, totaling Well over $2 billion in 
the last two decades, paying more than $25 million annually in property taxes and 
employing over 2,500 Mainers; 
3) Existing statute places very reasonable geographic limitations on those resources that are 
eligible, and speciﬁcally allows renewable energy that is delivered into the New England 
bulk power system, regardless of where it is generated, to qualify for the RPS. This 
includes resources owned and operated by the Canadian government, including Hydro 
Quebec (“HQ”) and New Brunswick Power. Notably, according to page 115 of their 
2022 annual report, HQ currently has 16 hydro generating stations rated less than 100 
MW totaling 680 MW, for which they have not sought Maine RPS certiﬁcation. One has 
to Wonder why they have never pursued certiﬁcation for the RPS; and
