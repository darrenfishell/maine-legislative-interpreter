Victoria Bucklin
Appleton
LD 43
Good day, Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Energy, Utilities, 
and Technology Committee. My name is Victoria Bucklin and I live in Appleton. I would like to 
testify in favor of both LD 43: An Act to Reduce the Cost of Electricity by Removing the 
100-megawatt Limit on Renewable Resources of Energy and LD 622: An Act to Create Equal 
Opportunity Access to Clean Energy by Removing the 100-megawatt Limit on Clean Energy 
Sources. 
As you are well aware, Energy policies in Maine are very complex and I applaud the work you
do to bring the Maine people, their businesses, and industries safe, reliable, and inexpensive 
energy. 
Governor Mills recently committed Maine to reaching 80% renewable energy sources by 2030
and there is talk of reaching 100% by 2050. 
Currently our agricultural land is being covered with solar farms and wind farms are slated for 
our fishing waters. We are being encouraged to switch from fossil fuels to electric heat 
pumps, electric cars and buses, and electric appliances. 
According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Maine Analysis, updated 
September 15, 2022 our state currently “does not generate enough electricity to meet 
demand”. 
Furthermore, when our solar and wind farms cannot supply the needed electricity, we have to
switch to costly and inefficient petroleum-fired generation. 
In order to meet our short and long-term goals and also to be able to grow more prosperous 
in the future, we need to diversify the sources of renewable energy; we need to remove the 
100 MW limit on the resources listed in these two bills. 
Please vote “Ought to Pass” on both LD 43 and LD 622.
