Good
moring,
Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Plueker
and
members
of
the
Agriculture,
Conservation 
and
Forestry
Committee,
My
name
is
Annie
W atson.
I
am
here
today
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
Maine
Dairy
Industry
Association,
in 
support
of
LD
1227.
The
Maine
Dairy
Industry
Association
(MDIA),
which
represents
all
of
Maine’ s
dairy
farms,
believes
any 
legislation
should
strike
a
balance
between
the
need
to
support
renewable
ener gy
sources
and
support
the 
long-term
viability
of
agricultural
operations
in
our
state.
As
the
committee
is
well
aware,
Maine
dairy
farmers
have
felt
the
pressure
of
many
years
of
depressed 
pricing,
and
most
recently ,
inflationary
conditions.
When
solar
companies
look
to
site
projects
on
farmland 
historically
rented
to
local
farmers,
it
is
hard
for
farmers
to
compete
with
well-financed
ener gy
projects. 
Competition
between
two
beneficial
land
uses,
agriculture
and
solar
development
delays
the
siting
of 
needed
renewable
ener gy
resources
and
threatens
prime
farmland
and
food
systems
when
we
take
an 
either/or
perspective.
This
is
why
we
fully
support
piloting
dual-use
siting
of
solar
projects.
By
conducting
a 
pilot
program,
the
state
can
learn
valuable
lessons
from
a
“boots
on
the
ground”
application
of
these 
techniques
in
siting
solar
arrays.
The
pilot
program
gives
the
DACF
and
its
partners
the
opportunity
to 
collect
data
to
further
determine
how
solar
projects
af fect
agricultural
production
and
what
kinds
of
benefits, 
costs
and
support
needs
are
associated
with
this
type
of
development.
W e
can
all
recognize
the
impact
solar
arrays
have
had
on
our
landscape
as
we
drive
throughout
the
state. 
This
is
why
we
feel
it
is
more
important
than
ever
to
balance
the
important
interests
of
agriculture
and
solar 
to
ensure
the
two
can
co-exists
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
today ,
and
I
am
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
