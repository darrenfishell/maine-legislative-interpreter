in Maine to determine viability for farmers interested in pursuing solar energy generation on 
their land while continuing to farm actively. The results of a well-developed pilot program will 
be instrumental in demonstrating whether dual-use solar development is viable in Maine and 
could lead to fL1111I‘6 policy developments supporting dual-use growth, if so. However, DACF 
currently lacks sufﬁcient staff and expertise to lead this pilot design effort. We will require a 
new, full-time staff member to join our team. Without it, DACF will not be successful in meeting 
this bill’s charge. 
Thank you. I am happy to answer any questions you may have now or at the work session.
