Working Lands Conservation 
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, my name is Jeff Romano. I appreciate this opportunity to provide 
testimony on behalf of Maine Coast Heritage Trust in support of LD 1227. 
 
Maine Coast Heritage Trust conserves and stewards Maine's coastal lands and islands for their 
renowned scenic beauty, ecological value, outdoor recreational opportunities, and contribution 
to community well-being. We provide statewide conservation leadership through our work with 
land trusts, coastal communities, and other partners. Over the past five decades, we have 
conserved more than 185,000 acres in Maine. 
 
LD 1227 calls for a pilot project to evaluate innovative ways to develop dual-use solar energy 
systems on productive farmland. This worthwhile exercise could provide much needed 
information as the state continues to balance the desire for renewable energy with the benefits 
of existing natural and working lands. We encourage the committee to support this measure 
and look forward to seeing the information gathered through its successful implementation.
