in support of 
LD 1799: An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children 
by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Annie Colaluca and I'm the Preschool Director for the 
Bath Area Family YMCA I support LD 1799 An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early 
Learning and Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
Collectively, the 15 YMCAs in Maine are the largest childcare provider in the state We serve 
thousands of children in our early childhood education programs, before/afterschool programs, 
and summer camp These programs provide children with safe, nurturing, and enriching care, 
and are a critical component of our state's infrastructure to support working parents and our 
economy 
In 2008, the Bath Area Family YMCA entered a partnership with RSU1 school district to provide 
public pre-K as a partner in the CHOICES program (Children Having Opportunities in 
Collaborative Early Settings) In the 15 years of this partnership, the Y has provided pre-K to 32 
children each year The coveted slots at the Bath Y fill up quickly through a lottery system, and 
our waitlist continues to grow each year 
The unique nature of our partnership allows us to provide a full day of high-quality care for the 
children in our program Children attend pre-K in a designated classroom at the Y from 8 30AM 
to 12PM, and then we seamlessly integrate them into wraparound programming for the 
remainder of the day Practically speaking, this means that families have care for their children 
from 7AM to 5PM, Monday through Friday in one safe, convenient location We know this care is 
particularly essential for parents that are working full time and don't have the ability to end their 
workday early, or transport their children from pre-K to a separate aftercare program in the 
middle of the workday 
Our public pre-K program employs state certified teachers and provides children with learning 
opportunities that prepare them for kindergarten and beyond Additionally, we provide all 
children with weekly swim lessons, music classes, yoga, gymnastics and more through the 
resources we have available as a community —centered facility 
As Maine expands public pre-K availability, we must continue to lift up the mixed delivery model 
as a critical component of supporting working families with young children 
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1799 
Respectfully submitted, 
Annie Colaluca, Preschool Director, Bath Area Family YMCA
