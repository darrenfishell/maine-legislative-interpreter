Testimony of Meg Helming before 
the Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
in support of 
LD 1799: An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children by 
Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs, my name is Meg Helming and I'm the COO of the YMCA Alliance of Northern New England, 
which represents the 15 YMCAs in Maine I am also a parent of two young children I support LD 1799 An 
Act to Expand Maines High-quality Early Leammg and Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool 
Opportunities in Communities. 
Collectively, the 15 YMCAs in Maine are the largest childcare provider in the state We serve thousands of 
children in our early childhood education programs, before/afterschool programs, and summer camp 
These programs provide children with safe, nurturing and enriching care, and are a critical component of 
our state's infrastructure to support working parents and our economy 
Many of my YMCA colleagues have submitted testimony in support of this bill from a childcare provider 
lens Today, I stand before you as a parent of two young children, struggling to navigate a care system 
that simply cannot meet my family's needs Due to systemic challenges in the early childhood education 
sector, I feel like I am counting down the days until my children turn five so they can go to public school 
and my husband and I can get out from under the financial and logistical burden of maintaining childcare 
To be clear I love my children's childcare provider, my kids are thriving there But securing and 
maintaining the care has been incredibly stressful, and the cost is crushing. This isn't fair or sustainable 
for my family, or any of the families that are struggling at no fault of their own 
While the Department of Education shares on its website that 80 percent of Maine school districts offer 
public preschool, many of these programs are completely out of reach to families For example, my school 
district, MSAD #51, runs a public pre-K program for 32 children per year - when the average number of 
students per grade is more than 160 The schedule IS four half-days per week during the school year only 
This is simply impossible for working families to manage What this means on a practical level for my 
family IS that we will pay an additional $14,000 per child for an extra year of childcare in their existing 
program in a different town This additional year of childcare is financially and logistically burdensome to 
my family 
The childcare system needs public investment to meet the needs of Maine families LD 1799 would expand 
access to publicly-funded pre-K that better aligns with the needs of working families by leveraging the 
existing network of childcare programs across Maine This is an efficient use of resources that also helps 
minimize disruption of care for children 
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1799 
Respectfully submitted, 
Meg Helming
