The DOE works collaboratlvely w1th the Ofﬁce of Chrld and F amlly Servlces (OFCS) and other 
d1v1s1ons w1th1n DHHS that have purvrew over early care and learnmg Addrtronally, the Mame 
Ch1ldren ’s Cabmet also provldes a structure for ensurrng mformatlon sharmg and ongomg 
collaboratron across agencres The recently awarded PDG1s a great example of that 
collaboratlon It 1s rmportant to ensure that any leglslatlon about pre-school expanslon 
coordmates w1th the current work of the DOE and OCFS 
It 1s unclear what the v1s1on 1s for how the proposed Commrssron would coordmate w1ﬂ1 the 
other workmg groups or stakeholder groups outlmed m LD 1799 Introducmg a new element to 
the governance structure may have the umntended consequence of settmg back some of thrs 
work so that new members may become acquamted W1th the content area and exrstmg p1'O_]GC'[S 
W1th work m progress, or planned, on many of the act1v1t1es outlmed m the proposed b111, 1t 
would be helpful to prov1de tnne to rmplement the strategres m the PDG (mfrastmcture grant) 
before tmplementmg addltronal stakeholder groups and studylng new governance structures 
We are also open to companng the makeup of the PDG Workgroups w1th the makeup of the 
Workgroups outlmed 1n the b11l to ensure stakeholder alrgnment 
The Department Wlll be avarlable to prov1de add1t1onal mfonnatron on LD 1799 and respond to 
any questrons dunng the upcom1ng work sess1on
