Grace Leavitt, President, Maine Education Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, 
My name 1S Grace Leavitt My pronouns are she, her, hers I am serving as President of the Maine 
Education Association while on leave from teaching Spanish in MSAD 51 I have over 43 years of 
classroom teaching experience with 20 years as a National Board Certified teacher The MEA represents 
nearly 24,000 educators in our Maine system of public education in pre-K-12 schools as well as in our 
institutions of higher education, both the University of Maine System and the Maine Community 
College System, along with students in teacher prep programs as well as many retired educators 
I am testifying on behalf of MEA in support of LD 1799, An Act to Expand Maine’s High-quality Early 
Learning and Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
Several years ago, the MEA Board of Directors voted to _]O1I1 the Right From the Start Coalition 
(https //www rightfromthestartmaine org[) as there was a greater awareness about the impoitance of the 
experiences our students had prior to entering our schools For some time we had been seeing firsthand 
the impact of the inequities too many of our youngest children faced and the widening gap these caused 
in learning for many students in their later years I also, as an individual, _]O1I16d both the Maine 
Association for the Education of Young Children (MAEYC) and the National Association for the 
Education of Young Children (NAEYC) I learned much more about what Maine has, and doesn’t have, 
for early childhood care and education, and both the critical need and the urgency to address this 
situation in our state MAEYC made available showings of a documentary, “N 0 Small Matter”1 , whichI 
would encourage everyone to view if they are not very familiar with the importance of quality early 
learning and care It’s not that I wasn’t already aware to an extent of the importance myself-—I have two 
daughters and I was incredibly lucky that they were cared for by wonderful childcare providers, from 
infancy on through to their before and afterschool programs These providers happened to have settings, 
programs, and practices that were comparable to what I viewed in the aforementioned documentary 
How fortunate I was, as well as my daughters, that I not only could locate these providers, that they had 
space for my children, and that I could afford this essential care (though it was a struggle, even though 
the cost was reasonable and these providers deserved to be paid so much morel) 
But we should not leave it to luck for a child to have what all children need and deserve We should be 
providing for all children, for all families, in all parts of the state, the kind of quality early care and 
learning that creates a solid foundation for fuither learning and future success and equal opportunity for 
all

In the years smce MEA _]O1Il6Cl R1ght From the Start, Mame has seen much progress toward provrdmg 
un1versal pre-K 1n our state The grants through the Ma1ne Department of Educat1on for pre-K expansron 
have contrrbuted 1n no small way to that progress Yet more 1s needed to be sure we reach the shared 
goal of equ1table access to qual1ty early learn1ng for all ch1ldren 
One caveat—-both the DOE grants and what LD 1799 could pI'OV1d6, when passed, allow for 
pubhc/prrvate partnershlps MEA of course hopes that 1n the future all of our pubhc schools have pre-K 
programs as part of the1r prograrmmng, w1th space for all students and not lrrmted to Just a few that w1n 
a lottery Agarn, we should not be dependmg on luck when 1t comes to do1ng nght by all of our ch1ldren, 
1n all areas of the state MEA 1s concerned about address1ng 1nequ1t1es 1n what we provlde for all 
students and also 1nequ1t1es 1n pay, beneﬁts, and worklng cond1t1ons for the adults who teach and work 
w1th our chrldren Any such 1nequ1t1es are best addressed when pre-K 1s part of each pubhc school 
system But we fully recogn1ze the challenges of pre-K be1ng fully pI'OV1d6d 1n our pubhc schools at th1s 
t1me due to 1nsuff1c1ent space, stafflng shortages, and other d1ff1cult1es, and the urgency of mak1ng good 
progress on our shared goal of unrversal quahty pre-K 1s great 
Thus we urge your support of LD 1799 as we all work to keep mov1ng forward to provlde what all 
chlldren deserve 
I thank you for your trme and am glad to answer any questlons
