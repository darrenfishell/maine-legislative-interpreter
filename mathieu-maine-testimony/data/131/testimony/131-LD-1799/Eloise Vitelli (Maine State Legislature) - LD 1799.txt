Testimony of Senator Eloise Vitelll presenting 
LD 1799, An Act to Expand Maine’s High-quality Early Learning and Care 
for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Bremian, and fellow members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, my name is Eloise Vitelli, and I represent Senate District 24, which includes 
all of Sagadahoc County and the Town of Dresden in Lincoln County I am before you today to 
introduce LD 1799, “An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for 
Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportumties in Communities” 
We all want to be able to educate our youngest children and give them the strongest possible 
start I have been working hard, alongside child care providers, early educators, and experts in 
the ﬁeld, on a bill to put Maine’s pre-K on a path to long-term growth and stability 
My bill would establish a timeline, an implementation plan and incentives to expand publicly 
ftmded preschool programmmg to 30 hours per week or the length of the local school day ata 
school administrative unit with the goal of establishing an equitable, mixed delivery public 
preschool system that provides universal access for preschool-aged children and their families 
The bill will help all of Maine model what we've already seen succeed in my district, where Bath 
and Brimswick offer high quality preschool in multiple places in our public schools, in our 
YMCA and Headstart programs, and in our private child care facilities Under this model, we 
deliver families access to pre-K wherever it is most convement to theml The family decides 
where is best for their child to learn — maybe it’s because an older sibling already attends that 
local elementary school, maybe it’s because the YMCA 1S two blocks away, maybe it’s because 
the beloved local child care provider 1S already part of the fainily’s routine 
My bill would expand tlus mixed-delivery model of pre-K education throughout Maine 
Maine parents would have more full-day pre-K options, something working families need 
Mame has made steady progress on public pre-K expansion over the past decade, reaching 50% 
enrollment for the ﬁrst time ever Now it’s time to strengthen a mixed delivery system which 
ensures parent choice, expands pre-K to a full school day to better match the needs of working 
parents, and aligns professional development and career pathways for all early educators

Today, 6,269 four-year-olds 1n Mame attend publ1c preschool 79% of Ma1ne school d1str1cts 
offer pubhc preschool now, and Mame DOE belreves 85% W111 by 2024 My b1ll 1s about closmg 
th1s gap and leav1ng no fam1ly behmd My b1ll w1ll push for act1onable t1mel1nes and goals so 
Mame can reach 100% A con1m1ss1on w1ll t1e 1n the Work bemg done w1th federal preschool 
development funds that Mame DOE 1s workmg on, and brmg the commumty chrld care 
providers to the table so that by March 2024 we have a clear path to 30/hour week preschool 
optlons 1n every part of our state 
Marne law already allows for school adm1n1strat1ve umt partnershlps w1th commumty provrders 
such as Chlld Care, Head Start, YMCA, and others However, only 24% of school admlmstratrve 
un1ts offer pubhc pre-k 1n partnershrp wrth a commumty provrder 
Rrght now, 164 of the 190 Mame school adm1n1strat1ve un1ts offer pubhc pre-k, but many are not 
offermg enough spaces to be consldered umversal Only 42% of school admlmstratlve umts offer 
full day/full week pubhc pre-K opt1ons now 
When qual1ty pre-K 1s avarlable to ch1ldren, they are more lrkely to arnve at kmdergarten ready 
to learn, wrth fewer behavloral challenges 
Marne fam1l1es are askmg for access to affordable, hrgh qual1ty ch1ld care 1n every corner of the 
state In order to make Ma1ne’s program sustalnable, we must g1ve all Mame chrldren w1th 
workmg parents an opportunrty to access h1gh quahty early educatlon and ensure our k1ds are 
prepared for K1ndergarten Th1s b1ll adds accountab1l1ty and a t1mel1ne to the path to unlversal 
pre-K 
I am happy to answer any questrons you may have
