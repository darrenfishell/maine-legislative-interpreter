Senator Rafferty, Representatlve Brennan, dlstlngulshed members of the Educatron and 
Cultural Affarrs Commrttee, thank youlfor the opportunrty to testrfy today I am Jason 
Judd, Executrve Dlrector of Educate Mame, a business-led educatlon advocacy 
organrzatron I am here |n strong support of L D 1799 
Educate Marne's mlssron rs to ensure that Marne people are prepared to succeed tn 
educatlon and career and that all Marne people reach thelr hlghest educational 
potentlal lnvestmg |n robust early educatron expenences — as LD 1799 provrdes - rs 
cr|t|cal for later academlc and career success Educate Mame IS also a co-founder of 
the Ma|neSpark Coalltlon, Ma|ne’s state attalnment group focused on lncreasmg the 
number of adults wlth a degree or credentlal of value to 60% by 2025 to meet the needs 
of the economy We know that mvestmg |n hlgh quallty early educatron rs needed |n 
order to help adults stay |n the workforce and pursue educatlon and workforce tra|n|ng 
Marne has made tremendous progress rn expandrng publrc pre-K over the last several 
decades Publlc pre-K has been shown to be a srgnrfrcant help |n preparmg Ma|ne’s 
youngest crtrzens for K-12 educatron and also bulldmg foundatlonal Skl||S that |nd|v|duals 
use |n the workforce and throughout the|r l|ves Students that have experrenced h|gh- 
quallty pre-K prlor to Klndergarten are more llkely to arrlve at school ready to learn, less 
llkely to be held back, and more llkely to be proflclent |n readlng and math 
Approxrmately half of Ma|ne’s 4-year-olds are enrolled |n pre-K 
We would l|ke to see Mame bUl|d on progress to date by expandrng pre-K so that rt rs 
avarlable to more Mame students and meets the needs of worklng famllles Currently, 
publrc pre-K rs only requrred to be 10 hours per week Thls brll provrdes for pre-K to be 
30 hours so that It |s more allgned w|th tradrtronal educatron schedules and could make 
It posslble for parents of young chrldren to work The current system mrght 
unrntentlonally produce |nequ|t|es by reachlng more chrldren whose parents can afford 
not to work or who can afford alternatrve care arrangements around a 10-hour pre-K 
schedule

Marne has a range of h|gh-qual|ty pre-K programs m both pubhc schools and pnvate 
Chl|d care fac|l|t|es A mlxed delrvery system bUl|C|S on the current strengths of Ma|ne’s 
early Chl|dhOOd educatlon Unfortunately s‘|gn|f|cant geographlc dlspantles exlst |n pubhc 
pre-K programs wlth nearly unlversal pre-K access |n Aroostook and Washmgton 
Countles but only 20-30% of 4-year-olds enrolled |n pub||c pre-K programs In other 
countles ThlS b|ll would help address this geographlc Inequlty and lﬁCl'G8.S6 access to 
vanous pre-K models across Mame‘ 
The Mame Department of Educat|on ’s Early Learnlng Team has done a great ]Ob 
helpmg grow and expand pubhc pre-K, but they lack the staff to work w|th more 
commun|t|es to bu|ld the partnershlps needed to serve more chlldren |n a mlxed-dellvery 
model L D 1799 provldes consultants expenenced In early Chl|dh0Od educatlon to help 
create partnershlps between pubhc schools and lrcensed ch|ld care programs These 
consultants w|l| fac|l|tate the creatlon and lmplementatlon of pubhc pre-K expanslon Ina 
mlxed dellvery model so that there are no unlntended consequences 
I strongly encourage you to support L D 1799 l’m happy to answer any questlons
