Maine Community Action Partnership Supports 1799 An Act to 
Expand Maine's High-Quality Early Learning and Care for Children 
by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of 
the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, l am Megan Hannan, 
Executive Director of the Maine Community Action Partnership and the 
Advocacy Director for the Maine Head Start Directors ’ Association, and we 
support 1799 An Act to Expand Maine's High-Quality Early Leaming and 
Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in 
Communities 
Our,state ’s greatest resource is our people, and our state's policies shape 
people's possibilities ln Community Action, we create conditions that invite 
children to leam and adults to apply their skills, tapping into the deep rooted 
potential in our communities Through our Whole Family approach, we build 
a family's capacity for sustained stability and economic growth We invest in 
the family's well-being, we let them dnve their own story, and we have 
tangible success 
For our families with young children, we begin our partnership before a child 
IS even bom, with Early Head Start home visiting, we continue through Head 
Start, and in many areas of Maine, we have local public school partners with 
whom we offer public pre-kindergarten (pre-K) Unfortunately, in many 
areas, the availability of pre-K partnerships is for only a half day, or even 
less, meaning children who have been in full day care facilities, whose 
parents have been able to work full day schedules, are now in a place where 
they must choose to continue to work full time or try to ﬁnd a second, 
appropnate place for their children to continue to leam, play and socialize 
This is clearly not an ideal situation 
This bill addresses this issue in a few ways 
o lt funds full day pre-K classrooms to allow working families to work 
full days 
0 It allows more communities to begin or extend pre-K classrooms, so 
more families have access to it (today, only 50% of age appropriate 
children are enrolled in pre-K, and 21% of Maine school districts do 
not offer any pre-K) 
0 It supports local partnerships to align local resources, needs and 
opportunities 
All children have the nght to the best possible education, close to home and 
centered on their, their families ’ and communities ’ ideals I must be clear 
that Head Start partnerships are not the only option, only the one that most 
of my members are involved in The opportunity is only limited by the 
imagination and resolve of the community to make it happen 
Thank you for your time and attention l also ask for you to read the 
testimony of my colleague, Sue Powers, who is an expert in early education 
with many years of expenence in the classroom and in promoting and 
creating pre-K partnerships in Aroostook County and throughout the state
