Testimony of Katie Soucy on Behalf of Starting Strong 
In support of LD 1799 An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children by 
Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Katie Soucy and I am the director ofa coalition of organizations in Portland called 
Starting Strong Starting Strong works to improve outcomes for children and families in our community lam 
also the parent of a four year old and a child care consumer l’m testifying in support of LD 1799 An Act to 
Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool 
Opportunities in Communities 
Over the past four years, Starting Strong has focused our efforts on increasing access to high quality early 
childhood care and education as a key strategy towards supporting the overall success of young children, 
their families and our entire community Our commitment to ensuring that children and families receive 
high quality early childhood care and education is based on research which points to the positive long-term 
success of such programming and the significant gaps which exist in Portland 
In 2019, Starting Strong worked with national consultants and key stakeholders from Portland - including 
Portland Public Schools - to design a strategic plan for pre-K expansion that met the needs of families who 
were most in need of services and underrepresented in existing programming The result of this work wasa 
plan which focused on equitable access for all families through continuing to develop Portland Public 
School's existing mixed delivery public pre-K model 
A mixed-delivery model for public preK— in which services are provided in a mix of settings, including 
community child care centers, public elementary schools, Head Start sites, or family child care homes— , is 
often seen as the gold standard by those in early childhood education A key benefit of a mixed delivery 
public pre-K model IS the ancillary opportunity it provides to support children beginning at birth Leveraging 
investments in pre-K to support programs across the community in multiple settings strengthens the web of 
early care and education providers and offers parents and families clear benefits and best practices in early 
childhood education - including continuity of care from birth through age five, mixed-age group settings, 
before and after care for working families, and family choice For communities, a mixed delivery model 
offers opportunities to efficiently maximize existing resources by utilizing existing buildings and spaces 
already designed for early learning, by leveraging existing early childhood care and education funding 
streams such as HeadStart and the child care Subsidy program, and by retaining developmentally 
appropriate practices and settings 
Despite these benefits, expanding access to public pre-K through a mixed delivery model is often difficult for 
communities due to a lack of support and technical assistance in bridging and aligning the two departments 
(DOE and DHHS) and sets of rules and regulations which have governance over this type of effort LD1799 
begins to provide communities with the much needed resources to undertake public preK expansion ina 
manner that supports the needs of young children, working families, and public schools Thank you to 
Senator Vitelli for her effort and to this committee for your consideration of it here today
