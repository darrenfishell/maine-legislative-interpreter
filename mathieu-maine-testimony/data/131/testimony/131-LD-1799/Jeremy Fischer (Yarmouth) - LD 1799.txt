Unfortunately, public pre-K isn’t available in every community Why’? Starting a program is 
often prohibitively expensive It involves lots of planning, hiring teachers, purchasing 
classroom equipment and materials, and ﬁnding physical space Additionally, there’s oftena 
perception that most parents can (and should) pay out-of-pocket for private pre-K, so it’s 
simply not a priority in school budgets 
My wife and I moved to the coastal community of Yarmouth for the same reason that many 
young families move to town — the schools When our oldest was approaching four years old, 
we learned that Yarmouth didn’t offer public pre-K We were surprised and disappointed We 
sent our son to private pre-K, but I decided to run for the school committee with the goal of 
starting a public pre-K program in our district 
In June 2021, I was elected to the school committee and got to work My focus (some might 
say obsession) on pre-K is sometimes a source of amusement for my colleagues l often 
joke that there are three things that happen at every school committee meeting - the pledge 
of allegiance, approval of prior meeting minutes, and me talking about pre-K That 
persistence — along with the hard work of our administrators and the support of my 
colleagues — has turned decades of our community talking about public pre-K into 
meaningful action On March 10, we formally approved the program, and our district will 
welcome its first class of 96 public pre-K students in September 
President Biden has proposed a national expansion of pre-K programs, but regardless of 
what happens at the federal level, Maine lawmakers should make universal public pre-Ka 
priority Here are some policy changes that they should consider 
- Competitive pre-K expansion grants paid for with American Rescue Plan Act funds should 
not end when the pandemic relief runs out Maine should invest state dollars in these grants 
- Maine’s school funding formula should be changed to recognize the lower student/teacher 
ratios required in pre-K classrooms This will ensure more sustainable program funding 
- State funding should be conditioned on greater partnerships between school districts and 
private local providers In some cases this may mean co-locating public pre-K classrooms 
with private providers to avoid unnecessary construction costs In other communities, it may 
mean closer collaboration on professional development and “wrap around" care before and 
after the school day‘ 
With these modest policy changes, Maine can turn decades of talking about public pre-K into 
action, _|USlZ like we did in Yarmouth this year Providing this “head start” to every Maine kid 
will give them a more equal opportunity to succeed in their education and their lives And 
we'll all beneﬁt from their success
