Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee 
on Education and Cultural Affairs: my name is Meghan Marcous, I live in Auburn, 
and I am here today to testify in favor of LD 1799.
I’m a single mom with two kids – Josiah, who’s 4, and Samarah, who’s 2. I also 
attend Central Maine Community College. 
Raising kids is tough, but it’s amazing, and anyone who’s spent time with young kids 
knows they don’t wait to start learning until they turn five –  they are growing and 
learning all the time.  
That’s why pre-kindergarten public school is so vital for giving our kids their best 
start. The benefits of pre-school shouldn’t be limited to parents who can afford to pay 
for private school. 
LD 1799 is a big step toward giving all our kids the chance to start their education 
sooner, and take advantage of their amazing capacity for learning. 
The bill would take huge steps toward establishing a universal public pre-K program 
– expanding what’s already there in some communities, and helping others do what 
they need to do to provide this opportunity for their kids. 
I know the value of education, and I know you do too. Let’s do right by our young 
kids, and help give them the best start to their education. I hope you will support this 
bill. Thank you for your time.
