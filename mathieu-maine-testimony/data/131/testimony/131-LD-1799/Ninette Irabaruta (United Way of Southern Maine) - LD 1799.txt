Testimony in Support of LD 1799 - An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and 
Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name IS Ninette lrabaruta, and l am the Director of Public Policy 
and Advocacy at United Way of Southem Maine (UWSM). I am here today on behalf of all the United 
Ways in Maine to express our support for LB 1799, a bill that would expand publicly funded preschool 
to establish an equitable, mixed delivery system with the goal of creating universal access for preschool 
aged children and their families 
The data and research around access to high-quality preschool is clear it is pivotal in shrinking existing 
proﬁciency gaps between low-income students and their peers from wealthier families, it boosts holistic 
school readiness in terms of academic, social, and emotional development, and it’s proven to provide 
long-term, lasting outcomes realized through increased graduation rates. 
The State of Maine has made incredible progress in increasing access to publicly funded preschool 
opportunities in partnership with school districts in the past few years However, our hardworking 
families deserve to see a continued, concerted effort to bring a comprehensive mixed-delivery 
preschool system to fruition This mixed-delivery methodology created in partnership with ECE 
providers and school districts is key, it woutd provide new opportunities for many low-income families 
that rely on extended hours of care, and it would support students with dynamic needs to ensure they’re 
in a setting that best nurtures their growth 
This bill will set Maine on track to expand public preschool throughout the state by looking at 
partnerships between school districts and licensed childcare programs. 
All United Ways in Maine support LB ‘W99 because Maine students and families deserve access to 
equitable preschool opportunities that ﬁt into their lives, honor diverse student needs, and are 
intentional about holistically preparing our youngest leamers for kindergarten. For these reasons, we 
respectfully encourage you to support and pass LD 1799 — a mechanism to thoughtfully improve our 
system of education for Maine‘s students, families, and communities. 
Thank you for your leadership and service.
