Communities  
 
 
May 10, 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Nicole Evans and I am the Executive 
Director of United Way of Mid Coast Maine. On behalf of our organization, I’d like to express our 
support for LD 1799.  
 
Maine has made steady progres s in public preschool expansion. Today, we have the opportunity to 
provide the best start for children for generations to come.  
 
Let’s ensure every child, family, and community has access to public pre -K. Let’s work to support 
and value those who we trust  to care for and educate our children. Let’s provide full -day public pre -
K to support working families, and help organizations and businesses secure a sustainable 
workforce today  while build ing tomorrow’s thriving economy.  
 
Together, we can help public schools, child care centers, family child care and Head Start 
programs meet the needs of children, families, and communities.  
 
Thank you for working to help ensure Maine’s future leaders have the support they need to 
succeed, and thank you for your consideration to support and pass LD 1799.  
 
We are grateful for your service.
