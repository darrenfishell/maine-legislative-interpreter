Merry Sagadahoc County Sherlff I am also a Past Presldent of Mame Shenffs’ anda

Mame law enforcement leaders I am also a father, grandfather and actIve commumty 
member It Is my honor to testlfy In support of PreK expansIon as proposed In l_D 1799 
I would lIke to offer the commIttees a unlque perspectlve on hIgh-qualIty early learnlng— 
Its Impact on cnme l have been In law enforcement for my entIre 40+ year career andI 
have seen how the lack of properly super\/Ised actIvItIes can lead kIds Into crIme-ndden 
GHVll'Ol'llTIGl'lIIS 
Government ’s most fundamental responsIbIlIty Is to protect the publlc safety There Is 
no substltute for tough law enforcement But once a cnme has been commltted, llves 
have already been shattered Those of us on the front lIne In the ﬁght agaInst cnme 
understand that we WIII never fIx the cnme problem solely through arrests and 
Impnsonment We can save llves, hardshlp — and money — by InvestIng In programs 
that can keep chlldren from growIng up to become crImInals In the ﬁrst place 
Today l'm here to tell you that hIgh-qualIty early learnlng programs are also a great 
cnme reductlon strategy 
Many In thIs room know what the research tells us about what a cntlcal tlme the flrst fIve 
years of lIfe IS for a chIld’s physIcal, emotlonal, behavloral and cognItIve development 
What Is equally Important, but less well known, Is that quahty early learnIng programs 
can also sIgnIfIcantly reduce the chances of a chlld grovvlng up to become a crImInal

Research clearly shows that high-quality early care and education for at-risk kids not 
only reduces their likelihood of committing a crime later in life, but also provides far 
greater savings than costs A study of the Chicago Child-Parents Centers shows these 
facts These centers provided school readiness programs to 100,000 preschoolers from 
some of Chicago’s toughest neighborhoods over the course of 30 years At age 18 the 
study examined outcomes for a subgroup of these children and matched those 
outcomes with a peer group of similar kids not enrolled in the Centers The study 
showed that kids who did not receive quality early learning programs were 70 percent 
more likely to have been arrested for a violent crime by age 18 By age 24 the now 
young adults who were in the Child-Parent Centers program as children were 20 
percent less likely to have served time in jail 
l\/lost recently, an MIT study of the Boston preschool program found that enrollees were 
less likely to have been incarcerated in a jUV6l'lll6 facility during high school, compared 
to non-enrollees 
High-quality early learning and child care programs also save money A well-respected, 
independent cost-benefit analysis of nearly 20 different studies showed that early 
learning programs can, on average, return a “profit” (economic benefit minus cost) to 
society of nearly $27,000 for every child served, when cost savings from reduced crime 
are included 
Maine has made solid progress on increasing the option for voluntary Pre-K 
programming in various regions across our state in recent years, now serving about 50 
percent of our 4-year-olds 
We know that across our communities there are more schools and community 
partnerships interested in adding public PreK programs, and l appreciate Senator Vitelli 
bringing this bill forward to help make more public PreK in a variety of setting a reality 
for more of Maine’s youngest learners 
I encourage this Committee to unanimously support LD 1799
