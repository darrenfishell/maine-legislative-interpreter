Testimony of Sarah Farrell before  
the Committee on Education & Cultural Affairs  
in support of 
LD 1799: An Act to Expand Maine's High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children 
by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in Communities 
May 10, 2023 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Sarah Farrell and I’m the Director of Operations at 
the Central Lincoln County YMCA in Damariscotta. I support LD 1799: An Act to Expand Maine's 
High-quality Early Learning and Care for Children by Increasing Public Preschool Opportunities in 
Communities. 
 
Collectively, the 15 YMCAs in Maine are the largest childcare provider in the state. We serve 
thousands of children in our early childhood education programs, before/afterschool programs, 
and summer camp. These programs provide children with safe, nurturing and enriching care, 
and are a critical component of our state’s infrastructure to support working parents and our 
economy.  
 
Unfortunately, the childcare system is under incredible strain. The Ys have extensive waitlists of 
families trying to access care for their children. This leaves parents to make incredibly hard 
decisions around placing their children in unlicensed care, cutting back their work hours, or 
leaving the workforce altogether. Despite our best efforts, the system is failing Maine families.  
 
The childcare system needs public investment to meet the needs of Maine families. LD 1799 
would expand access to publicly-funded pre-K that better aligns with the needs of working 
families by leveraging the existing network of childcare programs across Maine. This is an 
efficient use of resources that also helps minimize disruption of care for children. 
 
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1799. 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
 
Sarah Farrell – Central Lincoln County YMCA
