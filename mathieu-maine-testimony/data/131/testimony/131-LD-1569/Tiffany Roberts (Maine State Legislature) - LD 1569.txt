Testimony of Rep. Tiffany Roberts presenting 
LD 1569, An Act to Exempt Certain Disabled Veterans from Property Taxes in 
Accordance with Their Disability Ratings . 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxationl 
Good mornmg, Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and esteemed colleagues on the Taxation 
Committee My name is Tiffany Roberts, and I represent House District 149 and the 
communities of North Beiwick and South Berwick I am here before you today to present LD 
I 569, An Act to Exempt Certain Disabled Veterans from Property Taxes in Accordance with 
Their Disability Ratings 
For those of you that were here in the 129th Legislature, you may remember this bill What I am 
presenting to you today is the amended version of LD 1042 that passed this committee 
unanimously but unfortunately died when We ad] oumed early due to the pandemic The only 
difference is the top beneﬁt amount is increased to $10,000 from the current $6,000 beneﬁt 
Our veterans have offered an enormous service to our country They have defended our freedom, 
protected our nation abroad and ensured that we can live m a peaceful and prosperous society 
Mame’s disabled veterans have offered an extreme sacriﬁce that they will live with for their 
entire lives 
Maine has an extremely high percentage of veterans 11% of Maine adults are veterans, this is 
nearly double the national average of 6 6% Of these veterans, roughly 20% havea 
service-connected disability rating 
These veterans deserve to live ni the communities that they love and to be able to afford their 
local property taxes Currently, a veteran who served dunng a recognized War period and is 62 
years or older, or is receiving 100% disability as a veteran, or became 100% disabled while 
serving, 1S eligible for a $6,000 exemption Disabled veterans can have a disability ratmg from 
10% up to 100% Their disability rating determines their federal beneﬁt but also the amount of 
income they are deemed capable of eaming As it sits, a veteran with an 80% or 90% disability 
ratmg does not qualify for our current tax benefit Generally, the percentage of disability and 
related payment amounts are also designed to compensate for lost work tune due to 
exacerbations of ilhiesses These veterans are still disabled, are limited m their work capabilities 
District 149 Part of North Bervvick and Pait of South Berwick
and have a decreased federal beneﬁt In an attempt to achleve equ1ty1n beneﬁts, thls b1ll 
proposes a stepped exemptlon stamng at a 30% d1sab1l1ty ratmg, wh1ch 1s the current threshold to 
quahfy for VA health care 
Under the proposal, the stepped exemptlon begms at $3,000 for an 1nd1v1dual w1th a 30% 
d1sab1l1ty and lncreases by $1,000 for every 10% of a d1sab1l1ty ratlng, prov1d1ng a $10,000 
exemptlon for 100% d1sabled1nd1v1duals The b1ll also requlres state relmbursement to 
mun1c1pal1t1es and the Unorganlzed Terntory Educatlon and Servlces Fund for 100% of the 
property tax revenue lost as a result of the exemptlons 
Th1s ﬁscally respons1b1e approach allows mun1c1pa11t1es to provlde rehef to our veterans wh1le 
keeplng 1n mmd other demands on our overall budget Whlle th1s commrttee dehberates other 
bllls related to veterans ‘ property tax beneﬁts, I urge you to keep th1s b1ll and the populatlon 1t 
W111 serve 1n mmd 
Thank you for your tlme, and I am happy to answer any questlons
