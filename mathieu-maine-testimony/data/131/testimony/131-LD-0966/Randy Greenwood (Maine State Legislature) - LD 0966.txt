Testimony in Support of LD 966 
“An Act to Align the Automobile Title Requirements with Those of Antique 
Automobiles ” 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation. I’m Randy Greenwood, State Represntative for 
District 56 which includes the towns of Monmouth, Litchﬁeld and Wales. I’m here 
today in support of LD 966, “An Act to Align the Automobile Title Requirements 
with Those of Antique Automobiles. ” 
I believe this bill will provide more clarity when dealing with automobile 
certiﬁcate of titles and the length of time where a title will no longer be needed. 
To illustrate this, I would like to share a personal story. 
In December of 2021, my cousin, who now lives in Florida, gave my 14-year-old 
son an older Dodge Ram 1500 pickup that had been parked in the shed of our 
family barn since about 2015. 
My son was so excited that he immediately began working on it, as this Was going 
to be his ﬁrst vehicle. He bought new tires and rims and performed a signiﬁcant 
amount of preventative maintenance as he worked toward getting it "road ready.” 
I asked my town ofﬁce about registering this as an antique auto. As we discussed 
this, I was shocked to ﬁnd out this vehicle still needed a title. This created a 
problem as my cousin, now in Florida, said he had no idea where that title might 
be. That was because in 2015, he did away with most of his worldly belongings 
and became a Missionary.

In my next conversation with my town office, she chuckingly said, "Well, you 
have the power to ﬁx this, Mr. Legislator! ” She went on to say how it only makes 
sense to set a rolling number rather than a speciﬁc model year number in Statue. 
As you know, a bill starts with an idea and that’s where this one comes from. 
I ask you to consider this proposal as a common sense approach to align the 
Vehicle Title Requirements to a 25-model year method. 
Thank you and I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have.
