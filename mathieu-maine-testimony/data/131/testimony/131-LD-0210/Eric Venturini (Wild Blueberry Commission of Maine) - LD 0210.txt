Testifying in Support  
LD 210, An Act to Expand the List of Persons Exempt from the Real Estate Transfer Tax  
Senator Grohoski , Representative  Perry , and esteemed members of th e Committee on  Taxation , my 
name is Eric Venturini and I am the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine .  
The Wild Blueberry Commission works on behalf of Maine’s 4851 wild blueberry farmers and businesses  
who grow our iconic wild blue berries on approximately 4 2,0002 acres across the state  and on 
Pass amaquoddy tribal land. In 2022, Maine produced 76 million pounds of wild blueberries representing 
nearly 100% of all wild blueberries  and 9.6% of all blueberries  grown in the US. Our indust ry contributes 
an estimated 250 million dollars to the state’s  economy each year and t hat contribution brings vital  
economic activity to Maine’s most impoverished count y, Washingto n County.3 
Wild blueberry farming is the most  time  honored agricultural trad ition  in Maine. The Wabanaki have 
been managing wild blueberry fields for thousands of years, and many other Maine farmers have wild 
blueberry farming traditions that extend eight  or more generations. This family tradition is what drew 
my attention to this  bill and wild blueberry producers agree that  the State should not tax  transfers of 
farmland between any family members . Fifty -eight percent  of Maine wild blueberry farmers have been 
farming for 2, 3, 4, or more generations. However, 42% are first generati on farmers  and would have had 
to pay 50% of this transfer tax  to start farming .4 Similarly, farmers trying to afford retirement would 
have to pay the other 50% of this tax, which would come directly out of their retirement savings.  
Consider that the averag e age of the Maine wild blueberry producer is 64.54. Many are enter ing 
retirement. Consider that the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine as representative of this important 
Maine industry, has identified as a,

Lack of profitability discourage[ing]  the next generation from growing wild blueberries and 
contribut [ing]  to the loss of farms and acreage.  
2023 Priority  
Develop [ing]  strategic initiative(s) to reverse the trend of decreasing wild blueberry farm 
numbers  
Long Term Priority  
 Grow [ing] the number of Maine wild blueberry farms and businesses  
Consider also the significant investments made by the State of Maine, and by agricultural organizations 
like Maine Farmland Trust to assist the next generation of farmers in getting on farmland.  
With these considerations in mind, I respectfully ask this Committee, why would we charge aspiring and 
retiring farmer s $1.2 dollars each, on e very $500 to sell or transfer their farm?  
I support this legislation and respectfully ask the Commission to cons ider further expanding the list of 
exempted real estate transfers  to include all transfers  of commercial  agricultur al real estate (as defined 
in MRS Title 36,  §2013  (1)(A)).  
I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.  Thank you for grantin g me some of your  
time.
