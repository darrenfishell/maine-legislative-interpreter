1TESTIMONY OF
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation
Hearing Date: 2/7/23
LD 210 – “An Act to Expand the List of Persons Exempt from the Real Estate 
Transfer Tax”
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Neither For Nor Against LD 210, 
“An Act to Expand the List of Persons Exempt from the Real Estate Transfer Tax.”
LD 210 adds siblings, stepchildren, and step-grandchildren to the list of 
family members whose deeds are exempt from the real estate transfer tax.
First, Maine Revenue Services has already taken the position that 
stepchildren and step grandchildren are persons exempt from the real estate 
transfer tax. This position is outlined in the real estate transfer tax guidance 
published in section 5(D) of Bulletin No. 31, which can be found on our website. 
Therefore, the portion of LD 210 that includes language for grandchildren and step 
grandchildren would only be a technical change. 
Next, while the bill addresses transfers between siblings, stepchildren, and 
step grandchildren, it does not specify whether stepsiblings would be included as 
persons exempt from the real estate transfer tax. We recommend the Committee 
consider whether to include or exclude stepsiblings from the list of persons exempt 
from the tax. 
2The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
