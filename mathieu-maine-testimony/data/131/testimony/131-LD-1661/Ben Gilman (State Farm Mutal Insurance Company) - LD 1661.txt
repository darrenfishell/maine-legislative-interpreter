Testimony of State Farm Mutual Insurance Company 
In Opposition to LD 1661 
An Act to Require a Liability Automobile Insurance Policy to Cover the Costs 
of Towing and Storing Certain Vehicles 
Public Hearing- May 2, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and distinguished members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee: 
My name is Ben Gilman. I am an attorney with Drummond Woodsum in Portland, and I represent 
State Farm Mutual Insurance Company. State Farm is the largest property and casualty insurer in 
the United States. Thank you for this opportunity to offer testimony in opposition to LD 1661, An 
Act to Require a Liability Automobile Insurance Policy to Cover the Costs of Towing and Storing 
Certain Vehicles 
Predatory towing and storage pricing adversely impact the cost of insurance and the availability 
of vehicles. The goal of towing and storage regulation should be to establish minimum standards 
for towing and storage vendor services and to promote fair and honest practices in these 
businesses. It is important to provide protection for motorist and policy holders on the roadways. 
State Farm is supportive of language that provides consumers a choice, by allowing vehicle 
owners the ability to select a speciﬁc tower and location where the vehicle will be towed, if the 
vehicle is not creating a road hazard and requires the tower to charge reasonable rates and 
provide the owner an itemized invoice in a reasonable time frame. 
The proposed bill adds additional coverage and leaves open-ended what “reasonable ” towing 
costs incurred could be. These costs will ultimately be transferred to the customer in the 
form of premiums.- 
We respectfully request that the Committee vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1661. We would be 
pleased to provide any additional information helpful to your consideration of this bill.E
