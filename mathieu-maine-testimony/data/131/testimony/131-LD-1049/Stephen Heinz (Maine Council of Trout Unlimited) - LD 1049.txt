LD 1049: An Act to Protect Maine's Inland Fisheries from Invasive Fish  
 
May 5 , 2023  
 
Senator La Fountain, Representative Landry, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing  
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife:  
 
My name is Stephen Heinz, and I am the volunteer coordinat or for Maine Council of Trout 
Unlimited (TU) actions regarding hydropower  licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) here in Maine. Trout Unlimited is a national organization whose mission is 
to bring together diverse interests to care for and recover rivers and streams so our children 
can experience the joy of wild and native trout and salmon.  I represent Maine’s  six chapters 
with over 2,000 members state -wide.  
 
TU is providing testimony in opposition to LD 1049 on two bases:  1) as a matter of law and 2) as 
a matter of biology . 
 
The Federal Power Act give s authority to prescribe fish passage to the Department of 
Commerce and the Department of the Interior. I have attached the applicable portion of the 
law - see the highlighted portion of page 3.   
 
The dam at Medway is licensed by FERC and that same authorit y will be exercised when the 
Medway Project is relicensed  after the current license expires on March 31, 202 9. That 
relicensing process will start next year . Both  Federal and State resource protection agencies will 
be part of that process. Fish passage pro visions are a likely outcome, one that cannot be 
prevented by adoption of LD -1049.  
 
Regarding the biology , while functional fish passage  is necessary for restoring and sustaining 
vibrant  native species communities within their native habitat, w e would also  point out that 
fish passage  facilities  are not primarily responsible for the spread of non -native fish within the 
state.  The deliberate introduction  of non-native  fish, is by far the leading cause. As an example, 
you need only need to look upstream from t he Med way Project to the Penobscot Mills Project 
that includes all the dams and their impoundments from the first on e upstream to the last one 
before Ripogenus Dam. That project is currently undergoing relicensing and the Initial Study 
MA I N E  CO UN CI L

 Report was posted on  April 24, 2024 [ Ripogenus - Penobscot Mills Initial Study Report , pages D -
111 and D -112]. It illustrates just how widespread non -native fish are throughout the system 
already  in the absence of fish passage at Medway  or any of the dams above it on the West 
Branch . These non-native fish were introduced. Note: upstream fish passage is provided 
between Millinocket Lake and Pemadumcook/North Twin .   
 
 
 
During the hearing for this bill, Representative Wood indicated that he had recently caught 
smallmouth bass in Kingsbury Pond. Kingsbury Pond has an impassable dam at its outlet —those 
bass did not swim into it !  Kingsbury Pond is yet a nother case of illegal  introduction  of a non -
native fish species . 
 
Passage of LD -1049  woul d impl y that the principal threat of movement of non -native species 
comes from fish passage , not human intervention and illegal introduction.  
 
While opposing LD -1049 for the reasons above , TU remains sensitive to the issue of non-native 
fish and their imp acts on Maine’s native fish species and aquatic  ecosystems. Non -native fish 
are one of the greatest threats to Maine native trout and salmon and we t ake this threat to 
them  seriously.  We hope  that the State will redouble its efforts to prevent their spread  through 
a vigorous program of public education complemented by a concerted enforcement effort by 
the Maine Wardens Service. MDIFW has input to the FERC process and diligently argues  for fish 

 
3 
 passage pr ovisions  that do not afford the spread of non -native species, and testimony provided 
by them on April 24, 2023 indicates that this will continue to be the case both for FERC -licensed 
and other dam s.  
 
We agree with the Maine Department of Inland of Fisheries and Wildlife and the Maine 
Department of Marine Resources that what’s needed here is not enshrining two barriers in the 
Penobscot watershed into statute, falsely believing that such will preclude  the spread of non -
native species . Instead, as supported by the Departments , we believe th e best outcome is for 
the two Departments to work together to “manage aquatic invasive species  threats ” while also 
supporting native species fish passage needs throughout the state.  
 
We urge you to vote  LD-1049 ‘ought NOT to pass.’  
 
Maine TU Council appreciates  the opportunity to provide testimony on the bill . 
 
 
Respectfully,  
.
