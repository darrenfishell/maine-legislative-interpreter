TESTIMONY OF SENATOR RUSSELL BLACK 
LD 1049 
“An Act to Protect Maine's Inland Fisheries from Invasive Fish” 
Public Hearing: April 24, 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. I am Senator Russell Black, and I am 
here today to introduce, L.D. 1049 “An Act to Protect Maine's Inland Fisheries from 
Invasive Fish.” 
I put this bill in at the request of Nels Kramer and he is here today to explain his 
reasoning behind it. 
This bill prohibits the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the 
Commissioner of Marine Resources from authorizing the construction of a ﬁshway 
or ﬁsh bypass structure at a dam on the Penobscot River in the Town of Medway and 
directs the commissioners to require a vertical barrier at least 4 feet tall in the 
ﬁshway located at the dam on the Piscataquis River at Brown's Mill in the Town of 
Dover-Foxcroft to prevent the upstream passage of invasive ﬁsh species. It also 
prohibits the owners, lessors or other persons in control of a dam on the Penobscot 
River in the Town of Medway and a dam on the Piscataquis River at Brown's Mill in 
the Town of Dover-Foxcroft from constructing or authorizing the construction ofa 
ﬁshway or ﬁsh bypass structure or removing or modifying current fish barriers so as 
to allow the upstream passage of invasive fish species. 
Thank you for attention to this legislation.
