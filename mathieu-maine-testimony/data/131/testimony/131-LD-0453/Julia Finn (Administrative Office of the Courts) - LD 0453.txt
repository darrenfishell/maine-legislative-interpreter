The Judicial Branch takes no position on the merits of this bill. I would like to point out, 
however, that there isla ﬁscal impact involved in making this change to our current practice; 
Presently, there is no clerk or comtroomteclmology assistant in the courtroom during grand jury 
proceedings, unless a party has speciﬁcally asked for the session to be recorded and the judge 
has approved that request. Assigning a clerk or courtroom technology assistant to the grand jury 
proceedings would remove that person from‘ another co,urtroom or other duties.'

We arei 
v/orking on a ﬁscal note and have polled our courts in order to determine how 
many grand jury days are held statewide each year. The ﬁscal note will contain the details of our 
analysis regarding the cost of coverage. _ . 'A
