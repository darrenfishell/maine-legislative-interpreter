TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ.  
 
LD 453 – Ought  To Pass  
 
An Act to Require the Recording of Grand Jury Proceedings  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
 
March  8, 202 3 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on  Judiciary, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede , and I am 
Policy Counsel  for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advanc ing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U.S. Constitutions. On behalf of our members, I urge you to support 
LD 453, legislation that would align Maine with  the federal  criminal procedure  of 
requiring that grand jur ies are record ed unless they are deliberating or voting .   
 
In 1979, the Advisory Committee on the Fede ral Rules of Criminal  Procedure 
proposed an amendment to those r ules requiring  that that all grand jury 
“proceedings, except when the grand jury is deliberating or voting, be recorded .”1 
This rule followed decades of litigation leading to dozens of rulings in federal and 
state courts either requiring  or recommending that grand jury proceedings  be 
recorded .2 Here are four of the many  reasons the A dvisory Committee gave  for its 
recommendation.  
 
First, should a witness say one thing  to the grand jury and another at trial, video 
evidence of the prior statement is the best way to expose the inconsistency. United 
States v. Cramer , 447 F.2d 210, 22 2 (2d Cir. 1971) . Second, recordation increases 
the trustworthiness of witness statements to grand juries  by prompting witnesses  to 
think twice before perjuring themselves to grand juries. Id. at 222. Third, 
recordation makes prosecutors  think twice before improperly influencing grand 
juries – or before improperly examining witnesses . As a Rhode Is land judge ruled in 
1969, “a sophisticated prosecutor must acknowledge that there develops between a 
grand jury and the prosecutor with whom the jury is closeted a rapport — a

20to%20make%20a%20recording .  
2 See, e.g.,  United States v. Cramer , 447 F.2d 210 (2d Cir. 1971)  (recommending recordation of jury proceedings ), 
Schlinsky v. Unite d States , 379 F.2d 735 (1st Cir. 1967)  (same) ; United States v. Price , 474 F.2d 1223 (9th Cir. 
1973)  (same ); United States v. Aloisio , 440 F.2d 705 (7th Cir. 1971 ), (requiring recording) ; United States v. 
Gramolini , 301 F.Supp. 39 (D.R.I. 1969)  (same) . 
  
 
dependency relationship — which can easily be turned into an instrument of 
influence on grand jury deliberations. ” United States v. Gramol ini, 301 F. Supp. 39, 
41-42 (D.R.I. 1969) . The judge concluded  that “Recordation is the most effective 
restraint upon such potential abuses. ” Id. at 43.  Fourt h, prosecutors themselves 
stand to benefit: if witnesses to grand juri es are unavailable  to testify  at trial , what 
better alternative than that very witness’s sworn statement bef ore anothe r jury ?3  
 
This bill would strengthen the ad ministration of justice in Maine. It would make 
courts fairer to defendants, prosecutors more responsible, and witnesses more 
honest. I urge you to vote ought to pass .  
 
3 Of course, the testimony is admissible at trial only if the defendant had a right to cross -examine the witness , or if 
the defendant waives their right to confront the witness .
