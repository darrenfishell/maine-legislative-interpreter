Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 453, An Act to Require 
the Recording of Grand Jury Proceedings:
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony neither for nor against this bill.
The Judicial Branch takes no position on the merits of this bill. I would like to point out, 
however, that there is a fiscal impact involved in making this change to our current practice. 
Presently, there is no clerk or courtroom technology assistant in the courtroom during grand jury 
proceedings, unless a party has specifically asked for the session to be recorded and the judge 
has approved that request. Assigning a clerk or courtroom technology assistant to the grand jury 
proceedings would remove that person from another courtroom or other duties.
We are working on a fiscal note and have polled our courts in order to determine how 
many grand jury days are held statewide each year. The fiscal note will contain the details of our 
analysis regarding the cost of coverage.
Thank you for your time.
