TESTIMONY TO THE 131ST SESSION OF THE MAINE LEGISLATURE 
JOINT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
Regarding LD 1426 
“An Act to secure housing for the most vulnerable Maine residents by amending 
the Laws governing Municipal General Assistance” 
 
Co-chairs Senator Baldacci, Representative Michele Myers and Members of the joint 
Committee on Health and Human Services, I am the Rev. Donald J. Rudalevige of 
Cape Elizabeth and a member of the Anti-Racism Committee of HopeGateWay Church 
in Portland.  I am writing in support of LD 1426, increasing support for Municipalities for 
General Assistance in providing housing for those in need of housing support. 
 
The effect of this bill would be to provide the means for the cities and towns to cover 
rental costs for the most needy in an ever-tightening housing market.  It also further 
relieves the financial pressure on these entities through the requirement that 
municipalities be reimbursed for 5% of their direct costs of providing benefits. 
 
This bill provides needed relief to the communities on whom the burden of providing 
housing, especially to New Mainers, falls disproportionately.  It also could have effect of 
making it more possible for those that have been reluctant to provide housing support to 
facilitate such arrangements. 
 
All agree that housing security is vital for a person or family to thrive, making it possible 
to pursue an education, and employment, even making it easier to provide adequate 
food. 
 
I hope the Legislature will pass this needed Legislation.> Thank you for your attention, 
 
Rev. Donald J. Rudalevige
