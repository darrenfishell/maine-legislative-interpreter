Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee My name 1S Kate Dufour, and I am testifyinglneither for nor against LD 1426 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by the1r peers to serve on the Assoc1ation ’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest 
In the category of great minds think alike, municipal ofﬁcials support sections 4 through 
7 of the bill, as the proposed changes mirror the provisions found in LD 1732, which was 
advanced by Rep Meyer on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association 
However, local leaders do have concerns with the rlemaimng provisions of the bill 
Training. Municipal ofﬁcials do not ob] ect to the training mandate but would ask the 
committee to further amend the language to direct the Department of Health and Human Services 
to make the training available at no cost to municipalities and access1ble either 1n-person, online 
or via a prerecorded video This change would help offset the costs of the mandate 
Calculation of Maximum. Municipal officials support the provision of the b1ll seeking 
to amend the way in which the maximum level of assistance 1s calculated However, simply 
directing municipalities to do so 1s not entirely helpful as it places additional burdens on the 
property taxpayers who are left to bear the cost of administering the program without any state 
reimbursement Instead, the department should be directed to calculate the maximum levels of 
assistance annually and to disseminate that information to ‘IIl11Il1C1pal1t1 €S in a timely fashion 
Period of Eligibility. While mumcipal leaders appreciate that authority to provide up toa 
year’s worth of rental assistance 1S voluntary, there 1s nothing in the bill to safeguard 
municipalities from a state level claw back of reimbursement should a recipient become 
ineligible for assistance dming the year While the ability lo provide assistance over a longer 
period of time could serve as a tool for ensuring the 3.CqLl1S1lIlOI1 of permanent housing, without 
provisions in statutes to protect municipalities, the investment may present too high of a risk or 
too large a ﬁnancial burden for property taxpayers to shoulder 
MMA is available and willing to work with the Committee, sponsors and interested 
parties to develop consensus on the best path forward 
Thank you for considering the mumcipal pCI'SpCC ’£1!VC on this issue If you have any 
questions about the Assoc1at1on ’s pos1t1on on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at
