Dear
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Health
and 
Human
Services
Committee:
Please
accept
this
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1426,AnActtoSecureHousingfortheMostVulnerableMaineResidentsbyAmendingtheLawsGoverningMunicipalGeneralAssistance
.
Since
2018,
QHC
has
provided
over
550
households,
over
1265
adults
and
children
with
permanent
housing
with
mostly
private
sector
property
owners.
Our
residents
are
older
adults,
families
with
school-age
children,
and
individuals.
All
of
our
residents
are
low
income
earners,
all
have
experienced
homelessness
and/or
housing
insecurity ,
and
all
have
insurmountable
barriers
to
accessing
and
maintaining
housing
without
our
support.
Despite
these
challenges,
once
housed,
99%
of
our
residents
successfully
complete
year -long
tenancies.
W e
navigate
our
residents
through
every
essential
needs
system
to
ensure
that
they
stay
stably
housed
and
on
their
way
to
self
suf ficiency ,
which
is
the
goal
of
every
single
Project
HOME
resident.
The
program
we
work
most
closely
with
is
General
Assistance,
which
is
why
we
are
thrilled
to
see
so
many
pieces
of
legislation
attempting
to
make
this
policy
work
better
for
the
people
it
serves,
for
the
people
who
administer
it,
and
to
make
it
more
ef ficient
and
less
costly
for
the
taxpayer .
Maine’ s
General
Assistance
program
is
a
lifeline
for
Maine
people
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
in
every
County .
W ith
89,000
Maine
households
unable
to
af ford
their
rent
today ,
out
of
approximately
163,000
total
renter
households,
this
lifeline
is
critical
to
the
health
and
safety
of
those
who
receive
these
services.
The
past
few
years
taught
us
more
clearly
than
ever
before
that
housing
equals
health.
W ithout
stable
and
af fordable
housing,
no
one
can
access
the
benefits
of
education,
good
health,
job
training/employment,
and
a
stress
free
retirement.
Simply
put,
a
safe
home
must
come
first
before
anyone
can
succeed.
Maine
no
longer
takes
that
for
granted.
From
our
perspective,
the
most
important
aspects
of
LD
1426
and
the
other
billsare:

1)
Requiring
the
State
to
cover
90%
of
the
General
Assistance
cost
so
that
municipalities
are
not
left
with
the
cost
burden
of
homelessness
and
poverty .
Maine
municipalities,
practitioners,
and
community
members
have
been
working
with
this
policy
for
over
a
decade
since
it
was
changed,
and
all
agree
that
the
State
should
return
to
the
90%
coverage.
2)
Aligning
the
General
Assistance
rental
payment
standards
with
Section
8/Housing
Choice
V oucher
standards.
Currently ,
DHHS
administers
3
rental
assistance
programs:
Shelter
Plus
Care,
BRAP ,
and
General
Assistance.
The
Housing
Authorities,
of
which
MaineHousing
is
one,
receive
Section
8
funding
directly
from
the
Federal
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Department
(HUD).
Of
the
163,000
renter
households
in
Maine,
89,000
who
cannot
af ford
their
rent,
there
are
only
12,000
Housing
Choice
V ouchers
in
the
State.
HUD
sets
the
fair
market
rents
for
Section
8
throughout
each
housing
authority
jurisdiction.
DHHS
applies
these
fair
market
rents
to
its
Shelter
Plus
Care
and
BRAP
program,
but
not
to
its
General
Assistance
program.
Instead,
General
Assistance
rental
payment
standards
are
set
by
the
Maine
Municipal
Association
and
then
adopted
by
each
municipality
each
year .
Across
the
State,
the
General
Assistance
rental
payment
standards
are
set
$100-$300
lower
than
the
HUD
fair
market
rents.
As
you
can
imagine,
this
disparity
causes
General
Assistance
to
be
less
desirable,
or
not
accepted
at
all,
by
landlords.
3)
Aligning
the
General
Assistance
reauthorization
process
with
every
other
rental
assistance
program
in
Maine,
which
are
every
year .
Currently ,
those
receiving
General
Assistance
have
to
return
to
General
Assistance
each
month
in
order
to
prove
they
are
still
income
eligible.
The
eligibility
process
is
costly
to
administer
as
it
takes
much
time
and
often
results
in
landlords
receiving
late
rental
payments.
In
addition,
our
Project
HOME
residents
report
that
this
is
a
demeaning
process
that
requires
them
to
perform
their
poverty
on
a
monthly
basis.
W e
strongly
believe
that
General
Assistance
should
operate
its
reauthorization
process
like
every
other
rental
assistance
program
in
Maine.
Some
may
be
worried
that
these
changes
will
cost
more
money .
W e
do
not
believe
so.
What
we
believe
is
that
aligning
the
rental
payment
standard
and
reauthorization
process
for
all
of
Maine’ s
rental
assistance
programs
will
reduce
the
administrative
burden
on

staf f,
on
nonprofits
like
ours
who
spend
between
10-40
hours
per
applicant
to
navigate
this
dif ficult
and
time-consuming
process,
and
on
recipients
of
services
who
must
devote
hours
and
hours
to
gathering
documents
and
waiting
on
lines
instead
of
actively
working
towards
their
goals
of
self
suf ficiency .
Some
may
be
worried
that
this
will
keep
people
from
pursuing
their
professional
and
career
dreams
in
order
to
stay
on
General
Assistance.
W e
do
not
believe
so.
What
we
believe,
and
what
we
see
every
day ,
is
that
100%
of
our
residents
want
to
move
into
self
suf ficiency
and
away
from
government
programs
as
fast
as
they
can.
However ,
when
they
first
access
General
Assistance
they
are
in
the
worst
crisis
they
have
ever
been
in
and
need
early
and
suf ficient
support.
Providing
early
and
suf ficient
support
is
the
best
strategy
for
reducing
the
time
they
are
reliant
on
programs
like
General
Assistance.
In
addition,
if
landlords
can
rely
on
General
Assistance
to
pay
fair
market
rents
like
the
other
rental
assistance
programs
in
Maine,
they
will
accept
it.
As
a
result,
more
housing
will
be
immediately
available
to
rent
for
those
receiving
General
Assistance.
More
landlords
accepting
General
Assistance
will
reduce
the
number
of
expensive
hotel
rooms
the
State
and
municipalities
are
paying
for
those
experiencing
a
housing
crisis
who
cannot
find
a
landlord
willing
to
accept
General
Assistance.
And,
once
people
have
a
home,
they
are
able
to
stabilize
and
make
plans
for
achieving
their
professional
and
family
goals.
Intuitively ,
we
all
know
that
when
people
are
unhoused
and
in
crisis,
they
are
unable
to
think
about
future
aspirations
because
they
are
in
day
to
day
survival
mode.
From
the
public
health
perspective,
having
future
aspirations
is
a
protective
factor
that
prevents
people
from
making
unhealthy
choices
and
keeps
them
on
track
to
achieve
their
dreams.
W e
see
this
in
our
work
day
in
and
day
out.
The
changes
before
you
today
are
exactly
what
we
all
want,
and
they
are
based
on
the
recommendations
of
those
of
us
who
have
worked
with
this
policy
for
decades.
What
we
all
want
is
a
policy
that
invests
appropriately
in
adults
and
children
in
deep
crisis
early
on,
stabilizes
their
homes,
and
encourages
them
to
actualize
their
future
aspirations.
