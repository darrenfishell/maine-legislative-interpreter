 Dear members of the Health & Human Services Committee - 
 I am writing in support of LD 1426, An Act to Secure Housing for the Most Vulnerable Maine 
Residents by Amending the Laws Governing Municipal General Assistance .   
 As the director of Fair Tide, a nonprofit supp orting people e xperiencing homelessness in the 
southern part of our state , I see  the impacts of the affordable housing crisis first-hand.  
Addressing t his pervasive  and complex  issue requires access to multiple  tools.  General 
Assistance is one important resource that is frequently utilized to help a household find stability , and, in turn, strengthen entire communities.   
 The changes proposed in LD 1426 would fortify the program such that local municipalities bear 
a smaller portion of the burden of addressing what is truly a statewide crisis. It allows for financial support directed to administrators of the General Assistance program so we can ensure these individuals are informed, educated and dedicated to the highest and most effec tive level of service.   This bill also rectifies the  mis-match be tween real rental costs and the 
G.A. maximums.  Finally, reducing the  frequency  of income certifications for recipients of 
ongoing G.A. rental support removes undue barriers and allows households to find the true 
stability necessary for su ccess.  
 I sincere ly appreciate your consideration of this bill which will have lasting positive  impact on 
many of our struggling Mainers.    Thank you,  
   Emily F linkstrom, MSW 
Executive Director
