LD 1426
 I don't comment here on this bill 1426 specific provisions, I do say that
 Maine and the US need to use proven interventions to address needs of an increasing 
number of struggling individuals and families. 
There are bills here today (182, 183...) placing new restrictions on public assistance.  
This punishes kids & families, creating more vulnerable communities & mental health
crises.  
Budgets matter
We spend more & more tax $$ for cops and jails, for arresting & housing poor and 
sick people behind closed doors harming kids, families & communities
Let's spend money to help families succeed
