Th1s b11l proposes the followmg changes All of these except for #2 have been recommended by

prov1ded for tenant-based housmg cholce vouchers under Sectlon 8 of the Umted States

6 Dlrects the Department of Health and Human Servlces to establlsh and provlde overseers 
w1th access to a statewlde database for tracklng appl1cants for the general ass1stance 
program and expenses relat1ng to the program, and 
7 Requ1res the Department of Health and Human Servlces to prov1de ass1stance to 
mun1c1pal1t1es W1th regard to processlng applrcatlons for the general ass1stance program 
and dlrects the department to establlsh a hotl1ne that 1s ava1lable 24 hours per day 1n order 
to provlde cons1stent, accurate adv1ce to overseers It also requ1res the department to 
respond to requests for ass1stance w1th1n 24 hours The Department of Health and 
Human Servlces would pay 5% relmbursement to all towns 1n Mame for the money they 
spend on operatlng GA The Department of Health and Human Servlces would g1ve GA 
ofﬁces the ab1l1ty to better track the number of GA appllcants The Department of Health 
and Human Servlces would make sure that then GA hotllne 1s ava1lable 24 hours per day 
1n order to p1‘OV1dC cons1stent and correct 1nformat1on to callers The Department would 
have to respond to hotl1ne requests w1th1n 24 hours 
Malne Equal Justlce supports LD 1426 because: 
1 Requ1r1ng tra1n1ng for overseers or appolnted mun1c1pal ofﬁcers w1th1n 120 days helps to 
ensure the program 1s run more effectlvely and conslstently Rlght now, the statute does 
not requ1re tra1r11ng 
2 Mak1ng the GA program to work l1ke a voucher program would make landlords see the 
program as a more relrable source of mcome, makmg 1t eas1er for people to obtarn 
houslng when they apply Currently, GA pnmanly functrons pnmanly as a rental 
ass1stance program and has worked th1s way for a long t1me Th1s 1s the mam source of 
rental ass1stance for most of Ma1ne’s resrdents w1th extremely low mcome, but for 
reasons slch as the program looklng drfferent 1n every town and the short el1g1b1l1ty 
per1ods, landlords are more l1kely to rent to someone w1th a Sect1on 8 voucher than a GA 
voucher Sectlon 8 vouchers cover the actual cost of rent for the tenant mlnus 30% of the 
tenant’s fsncome 1f GA max1mums are calculated the same way, more tenants w1ll be able 
to afford to be housed Rlght now, the fa1r market value 1s way beyond the average 
mcome of a Marner wrth low 1ncome Marne Equal Just1ce’s cl1ents are people w1th 
lncome at or below 250% of the poverty level, mean1ng they would all beneﬁt from th1s 
change 
3 By 1ncreas1ng the el1g1b1l1ty per1od for rental ass1stance from 30 days to l year, tenants 
and landlords al1ke won’t have to wony about havmg a place to lrve every month, or 
berng pard every month Th1s 1s another measure that makes the program more rel1able 
for all partles mvolved - even the GA ofﬁcers who won’t have to be overwhelmed by 
process1ng dozens of GA appllcatlons for rental ass1stance Th1s 1s especrally true for the 
larger c1t1es that have robust GA programs and offer many other necessary resources for 
those that need 1t (1 e Portland, Bangor, etc) 
4 By mcreasmg the rate of rermbursement to 90% for GA expendrture, more people w1ll be 
able to get the amount of ass1stance they need, because GA overseers w1ll know that the 
money w1ll come back to the towns If mun1c1pal1t1es can better rely on the state to 
support them ﬁnanc1ally, the rental ass1stance w1ll be more generous for apphcants, and> 
m turn be more rellable for landlords when cons1der1ng rent appl1cat1ons The lmpact 
that th1s change would have 1n terms of keeprng more people sheltered 1s lmmense A
3 
hrgh rate of re1mbursement whrch 1s guaranteed to mun1c1pal1t1es for somethmg such as 
rental ass1stance would make GA a more rehable source of rent 1n the eyes of landlords, 
reduclng nsk of source of mcome d1scr1m1nat1on and 1ncreas1ng the number of people 
who would be able to mamtam housmg a.nd shelter 
5 Requ1r1ng the State to provlde 5% relmbursement for program and admmlstratlve costs 
would serve the same purpose and same cham effect as those 1n #4 
6 DHHS bemg requlred to operate a 24/7 GA hotllne and ass1st1ng mun1c1pal1t1es 1n 
processmg appllcatrons makes 1t eas1er for DHHS to share respons1b1l1ty 1n GA as 
requ1red by the statute It also provldes landlords, tenants, and GA employees w1th an 
easy way to ask for support when needed Currently, DHHS and the State rarely mvolve 
themselves 1n mun1c1pal operatrons, even desp1te the statutory requlrement for 
mun1c1pal1t1es and DHHS to share the respons1b1l1ty 
CONCLUSION 
In sum, LD 1426 1s a common-sense proposal to strea1nl1ne the delrvery of assrstance to people 
Who are 1n need of shelter and rental assrstance at th1s unprecedented tlme, help ensure that the 
mun1c1pal1t1es that bear the l1on’s share of respons1b1l1ty for prov1d1ng GA to vulnerable people 
1n the state can contmue to do so 1n a way that 1s efﬁclent, sustalnable, and 1n accordance w1th 
the law, and overall make the program more umformly run and rehable It would also ensure that 
DHHS and mun1c1pal1t1es share the respons1b1l1ty and 1ncrease trammg and overs1ght Most 
lmportantly all but one of these proposals have always been recommendatlons from GA workmg 
groups that represented the mterests of all stakeholders 
For these reasons, I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1426 I’m happy to answer any 
questrons and I can be ava1lable for the work sessron
