Members of the Transportation Committee, 
 
My name is Carley Feibusch and I am the Municipal Administrator for Monhegan Plantation. I am 
testifying in favor of LD 1897. This bill would affect our community directly as we are an unbridged 
island that is not served by the Maine State Ferry Service. Given our small tax base, our roads budget is 
primarily for ongoing maintenance needs throughout the year with one or two additional improvement 
projects. There is not much reserve for emergencies or planning of larger projects that require significant 
funds. Having access to a specialized grant program could help push forward some long overdue projects. 
In recent years there has been an influx of grant opportunities that have been unattainable to us given how 
complex the applications are and how small our community is. Grants are often very competitive and can 
be intimidating for a small community. Having a specialized grant program to help communities like ours 
can really make the difference. It is much more attainable to apply for grant funds where the qualified 
applicant list is lower than some of the other statewide programs which donâ€™t always feel worth the 
resources. As both a resident of Monhegan and employee of the plantation, I support LD 1897. 
 
Thank you for your time,  
Carley Feibusch, Municipal Administrator 
Monhegan Plantation
