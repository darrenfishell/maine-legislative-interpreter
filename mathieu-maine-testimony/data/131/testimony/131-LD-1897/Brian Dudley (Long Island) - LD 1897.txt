RE: L.D.1897 â€œAn Act to Improve Public Roadways on 
Unbridged Islands Not Served by the Maine State Ferry 
Service. 
 
******************** 
 
I write on behalf of the Town of Long Island in  support of 
L.D. 1897. Our island has 6 miles of paved roads and another 
3 miles of gravel roads, requiring roadway improvements on 
a regular basis.  The costs for paving, sealing, grading and 
maintaining our roads are exponentially greater than on the 
mainland due to the added expense of barging equipment 
and crews. 
 
Historically, we receive about $9,000 a year from the MDOT 
Local Road Assistance Program (LRAP).  To this we add in 
$50,000 a year in town funds until such time as we have a 
sufficient pool of money to undertake roadway 
improvements. Thus, we are able to overlay new pavement or 
grade our roads about every three years. 
 
This legislation would assist island communities to stay 
ahead of the curve with respect to roadway maintenance. Our 
residents pay state excise taxes for their vehicles, but put 
little wear and tear on the mainland roads.   
 
This legislation recognizes our needs for additional sources 
of funds to supplement our local property tax commitment to 
our roads. 
 
Thank you for your consideration, 
 
Brian L. Dudley 
Town Administrator 
Town of Long Island, Maine
