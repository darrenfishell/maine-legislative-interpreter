Knox County CommissionKnox County Courthouse62 Union StreetRockland, Maine 04841My name is Sharyn Pohlman, and I am serving my second term as a Knox County Maine Commissioner, representing District 3 comprised of Isle au Haut, North Haven, Vinalhaven, Matinicus, Owls Head, Camden, Hope, Rockport and the unorganized territories of Criehaven Township and Muscle Ridge Islands.Commissioners are responsible for ﬁscal operations and policy decisions affecting County government. Additional duties include tax abatement appeals and hearings on maintenance of town roads. I have been on Isle au Haut several times and have met with the Road Commissioner who gave me a tour of the island roads, indicating the safety issues, cost of maintaining them and the logistics of getting them resurfaced and more. Isle au Haut receives no money from the county for it's road improvement even though Isle au Haut pays a great deal into the county, $81,663 to be exact. I support LD 1897 to help Isle au Haut, an unbridged island not served by the Maine State Ferry Service. Isle au Haut needs this money for the safety of the people driving on the roads, biking, walking, ﬁre ﬁghting capabilities, EMS services; every part of the communities health is enhanced by safe roads. Isle au Haut pays into the county and state coffers but doesn't get to take advantage of the services provided. They are remote and access is nearly impossible in winter months and distance hampers the ability in milder weather months. The funds provided in LD 1897 would assist, so small island towns like Isle au Haut, could provide improvements to their roadways. The obstacles that these small island communities face is  considerable on a daily basis and to level the playing ﬁeld so these communities can have, at the minimum, improved public roads year-round is a small request with a large beneﬁcial  outcome.Thank you for your time,Sharyn PohlmanKnox County Commissioner
