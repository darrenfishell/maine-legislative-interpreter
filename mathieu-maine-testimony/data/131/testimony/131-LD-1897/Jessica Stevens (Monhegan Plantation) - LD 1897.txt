Testimony Before the  
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  
LD 1897  – an Act to Improve Public Roadways on Unbridged Roadways Not 
Served by the Maine State Ferry Service  
May 16, 2023 
 
Chairman Chipman , Chairman Williams , and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation , I am  Jessica Stevens , a year -round resident and 
registered voter of Monhegan Island  for over 20 years . I am familiar with 
management of unbridged island roads having grown up in Isle au Haut as the 
child of a long -time Road Commissioner, William Stevens, and as an Acadia 
National Park Ranger in the 1990s on Isle au Haut. I became directly involved as 
the Road Commissioner on Monhegan Island for 8 years from 2003 through 2010.  
I still play an i ndirect role as the current emergency manager within Monhegan 
Plantation’s Fire Department , handl ing reporting of storm & disaster damage to 
Lincoln County and FEMA.  
 
I am  here to testify in support  of LD  1897 .  
 
• Since I began residing  on Monhegan Island in 2000, I have observed the impact 
of weather on island roads and seen that in the last decade  extreme weather 
events, especially intense rainstorms, drought conditions and warmer winter 
conditions have caused our dirt roads to be more sus ceptible to erosion and other 
damag e.  At the same time , the cost of road material , which must be shipped in a 
dump truck load at a time via barge , has increased . So too h ave the cost of 
culverts, freight on most other Roads Dept . supplies and labor.  While Monhegan’s  
current Road Commissioner does an admirable job, trying to keep the road in 
repair while keeping the budget low, an additional tax burden is likely based on 
the impacts of weather.  
 
• Maine Department of Transportation has kindly contribu ted to maintenance of 
Monhegan’s local roads, but that funding is only a small portion of the actual 
annual cost and DOT funding  has not increased significantly over 20 years. As 
evidence, consider the trend in  total amounts of State DOT funds paid to 
Monh egan Plantation from 2023 to 2022 (as taken from Monhegan Plantation  
Annual Reports):  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
2003 - $1098.00  
2004 - $2196.  
2005 - $3365.  
2006 - $2295.  
2007 - $2306.  
2008 - $2264.  
2009 - $2192.  2010 - $2196.  
2011 - $2492.  
2012 - $2752.  
2013 - $4150.  
2014 - $0 
2015 - $2588.  
2016 - $2576  2017 - $2616  
2018 - $2592  
2019 - $2200.  
2020 - $2280.  
2021 - $2436.  
2022 - $2420.00  
Monhegan Plantation does not have access to any other regular state funds to 
assist with Roads and other transportation -related expenses.  A grant fund would  
help as a buffer in tight times.  
 
•While FEMA has helped Monhegan Plantation  to fund the cost of extreme 
damage when a disaster is declared for Lincoln County, we are distant from 
Lincoln County and  the extreme weather events that effect mainland Lincoln 
County often to not align with the extreme weather events that impact 
Monhegan roads. On the rare occasion that a disaster declaration includes 
Monhegan, it is a long and complicated process to acqui re disaster assistance 
from FEMA even for a project that would take less than a day to accomplish on 
the mainland.  With issues of sea level rise impacting our wharf already and 
drought impacting our drinking water systems, Monhegan is contending with 
more infrastructure costs then in the early 2000s.  A Maine  Department of 
Transportation grant fund accessible to the unbridged islands would help at times 
where, despite careful planning, the municipality is overwhelmed by essential 
infrastructure needs . 
 
We sh ould be mindful of who is most  impacted by LD 1897 . The unbridged island 
communities have many challenges before them. This bill  provides a 
straightforward way to lend some equitable assistance to a portion of Maine 
residents who are well practiced at making do with less resources, but who could 
use assistance to keep the island infrastructure in safe and functional condition by 
residents and visitors alike.   
 
Please recommend that LD 1897  ought to pass.  Thank you for your time.  
 
Respectfully,
