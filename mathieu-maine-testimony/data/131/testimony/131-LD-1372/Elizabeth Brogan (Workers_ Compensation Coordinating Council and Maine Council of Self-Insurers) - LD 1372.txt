Testimony in Support of LD 1372 
An Act to Amend the Workers’ Compensation Self-Insurance Laws for 
the Use of Fronting Companies 
April 18, 2023 
Presented by Elizabeth Brogan 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Joint 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, my 
name is Elizabeth Brogan and I am the Executive Director of the 
Workers’ Compensation Coordinating Council and Maine Council of 
Self-Insurers and a resident of Cape Elizabeth. I appear before you 
today in support of LD 1372. 
Self-insurance provides qualifying employers more control over their 
workers’ compensation program and costs. Group self-insurance allows 
smaller individual members to band together for the same purpose, 
with premiums paid to the group and the potential for shared benefits. 
Self-insured employers represented nearly 36 percent of the market in 
Maine in 2021. As of Oct. 1, 2022, there were 18 self-insured groups in 
Maine, representing 1,172 employers. 
This legislation would provide a valuable option for group self-insurers 
with out-of-state employees. We support it, trusting that the Bureau of 
Insurance will provide regular examination and ensure regulatory and 
asset requirements are in place, as outlined in the bill. 
For these reasons, we urge the committee to vote ”ought to pass” on 
LD 1372. l am happy to answer any questions.
