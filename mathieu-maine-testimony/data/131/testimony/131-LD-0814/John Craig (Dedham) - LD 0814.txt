LD 814
The Honorable Senator Lafontaine, Rep. Landry, members of the Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife Committee, LD 814, An Act to Restrict the Daytime and Nighttime Killing 
of Coyotes, should not pass.  IFW’s estimate of the coyote population at 10k to 12k 
(with bears at 30k), is ridiculously low.  It’s irresponsible, without a realistic estimate 
of the actual population, to consider any limitations on existing control measures .  
This bill isn’t the end game for its supporters.  They seek a coexistence experiment 
for the State of Maine, with no harm done to coyotes ever.  Existing hunting and 
trapping maintains a level of respect with this apex predator which has no natural 
enemies in Maine.  Coyote attacks on domestic animals and people are a serious issue
in many parts of America where development, with little hunting and trapping, has 
limited the ability to maintain coyotes fear of people.  Nahant, MA is a good close 
example, with residents living in fear for their pets and themselves.  The end result is 
always the same.  Coyotes that have lost their fear are removed by killing them.  
Nahant hired $$$ USDA sharpshooters to do the work of what law abiding hunters 
and trappers are currently doing in Maine.  In 2009 a young lady hiking alone was 
killed in Nova Scotia, in an area where coyotes had lost fear do to protection in a 
park.  The pack of coyotes killed her in the same fashion they kill a deer.  We need to 
maintain our existing control measures, letting the hunters and trappers maintain fear 
of mankind in the minds of coyotes like sheepdogs protecting a flock.  This 
experiment, LD 814 supporters wish to force on Maine, won’t work and is actually a 
safety hazard for those who are unaware of the protections hunting and trapping offers
each citizen and their domestic animals.  Please do not support this bill as our elected 
official.  
Sincerely,
John A. Craig, Jr.
