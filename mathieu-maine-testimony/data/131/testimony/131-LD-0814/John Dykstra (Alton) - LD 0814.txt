LD 814
I would like to register my opposition to LD814.  This proposal is not based on any 
biological necessity, but is based solely on emotion and "feel good" efforts at best, 
and at worst is an attempt at crippling sound wildlife management efforts.  You will 
hear and read detailed and extensive testimony from former MDIF&W deer biologist 
Gerald Lavigne also opposing this bill, and you on the committee should pay close 
attention to his well thought out and expert testimony, which IS based on scientific 
data and his years of first hand experience with deer/coyote interactions.  One of the 
important distinctions that I believe he makes is that the current coyote hunting and 
trapping policy is directed more towards predator control than sporting harvest.  
Predator control is more extensive than strictly sporting activities.  
There is no question that even with current regulations in place , that the coyote 
population in Maine is holding its own and is certainly in no danger of extermination. 
There is no biological reason to impose any restrictions on current harvest methods 
and times.  In fact, the recent antlerless deer permit law approved last year has a 
section in it that requires the department to encourage additional coyote harvest for 
the benefit of the deer population in both the winter and  during spring fawning.  This 
bill would further restrict coyote harvest in complete opposite of what has been 
directed in the antlerless deer law.  
Again I would urge all members of the committee to vote against this bill, regardless 
of whether you approve of all the practices and methods currently being used, keeping
in mind that this is NOT strictly a sporting issue but that it is a predator control and 
management issue which often times uses methods and practices that would not be 
appropriate if it were purely a sporting issue.
