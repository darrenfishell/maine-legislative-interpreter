Good day,
From the books I have read, the lectures I've attended and what I've experienced in my own 
life here in Maine, it is time to start giving Coyotes a rest from year long hunting.  If coyotes 
can be given the freedom to raise their pups in a safe environment it  sets up coyote 
communities to understand how to hunt and who their  predators are.  If this community is 
disrupted, one of the coyote parents killed, it creats immense chaos in a complex social life.  
This type of disruption is when coyotes are more prone to have human interaction which 
usually does not end well.  Coyotes are self policing in their packs. If the packs are left 
unharmed they will not overpopulate.  A healthy pack knows how many coyotes their territory 
can feed. A healthy pack has both alpha males and females. Killing one starts a problem.
 
Maine also suffers from having a large deer population.  Coyotes prey on fawns, which helps 
limit the deer population which is very useful to farmers and homeowners.  
Please pass this bill to make it illegal to kill coyotes from April 1 to September 30th.
They are a help to us, not a nuisance.  
Thank you.
