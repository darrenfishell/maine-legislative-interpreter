Hello All, 
Approving this bill is the very LEAST that can and should be done to protect native 
Coyotes, our native wildlife. It is embarrassing and sheer insanity that Maine fosters 
killing coyotes, period, much less all of the time.  I have seen for years those who 
think killing is great fun and in doing so starve the dogs, run them ragged, cage them 
out in freezing weather, and more. Allowing hunting of all native wildlife "should" be
history. It is long past time for leadership to step up and protect native wildlife and in 
so doing recognize their role and value in our food webs and what life on this planet 
depends on. PLEASE safeguard and protect wildlife. And considering increasing the 
fine to $1500.00.  Thank you.
