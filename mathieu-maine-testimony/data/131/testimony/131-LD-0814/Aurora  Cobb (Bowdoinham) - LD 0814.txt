LD 814
With all due respect, I urge you to pass LD 814, An Act to Restrict the Daytime and 
Nighttime Killing of Coyotes. Current rules permitting year-round hunting place 
coyote families at risk during the spring and summer pup-raising season. This is a 
critical period in the lives of coyotes, the time when young coyotes learn how to 
survive, interact with other creatures, and become effective hunters. Because 
orphaned pups are deprived of these lessons, they are more likely to turn to domestic 
livestock as easy prey and come into conflict with farmers. It is therefore in 
everyone's best interest to protect coyote parents and families, so that young coyotes 
can grow into successful predators. Furthermore, a healthy coyote population is vital 
to the Maine ecosystem as well as to human health, since coyotes keep rodent 
numbers in check and thus help to mitigate the rise of the tickborne infections now 
endemic in our state. And – finally and most importantly – coyotes are our fellow 
creatures, our kin: for this reason alone they deserve our respect, not endless 
year-round persecution at human hands.
