The time between the dates stated in the bill is the time when the babies are raised and
taught how to live successfully in the wild and provide for themselves. If killing is 
allowed, the parents could be killed and then their babies would be left to fend for 
themselves which would disrupt their communities and make survival rate lower. All 
animals deserve the right to live into adulthood. A main reason why a coyote may go 
after livestock is it was not properly trained to hunt in the wild and is starving. 
Coyotes also keep deer and other animals away from crops.
