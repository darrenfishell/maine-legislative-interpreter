In a world that's going insane, don't add to it. 
An over population of any species is a bad thing. You all know this Whether it's bear, 
deer, coyotes or rats. Over populations hurt not only the species itself but all the 
species it affects including humans. 
I have seen over the years the areas where Coyote hunting with hounds             ( 
particularly Coastal Downeast ), has become very popular, the deer herd has 
rebounded incredibly.  
At the same time, social media is full of pictures more and more nighttime coyote 
hunters that are taking record numbers of animals. An animal not native to Maine and 
whose population is harder to control than any other next to mice. 
They took away the snaring program, don't take away the next best and only other 
methods that work. A method which evolved because of the loss of the snaring 
program.
 To allow the Coyote population to explode would be catastrophic to not only the deer
herd but the entire ecosystem not to mention domestic animals. Family pets etc. It 
would be horrific for the state of Maine. 
It will lead to desperate coyotes running through the streets of out cities and towns.
Do the right thing. Don't add to the craziness that is taking hold of our entire country.
