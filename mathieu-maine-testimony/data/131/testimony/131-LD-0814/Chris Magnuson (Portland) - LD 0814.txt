This is my testimony in support of LD 814 An Act to Restrict the Daytime and the 
Nighttime Killing of Coyotes.
Please add my name to the long list of concerned citizens, farmers and lawmakers 
throughout the state who feel that restricting the hunting season on coyotes is a 
positive and necessary step for Maine and Mainers to take.
Protecting this species and maintaining the natural balance is the right thing to do. 
Limiting the coyote hunting season ensures all the benefits that we now enjoy from a 
coyote presence in Maine (such as animal carcass removal), and keeps rodent 
populations in check, minimizing the spread of disease and defending the state’s 
agricultural industries.
The timing of the proposed restrictions on hunting is crucial to the development and 
life cycle of coyotes, when pups and young families are leaving the den, learning how
to hunt, etc. 
Shortening the period for legal hunting of coyotes is vital for giving this important 
member of Maine’s food chain a chance to survive and continue to contribute.
Sincerely,
Chris Magnuson
