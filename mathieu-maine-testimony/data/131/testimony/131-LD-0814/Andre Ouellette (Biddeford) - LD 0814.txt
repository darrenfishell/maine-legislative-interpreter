Dear Committee Members, 
I am writing this testimony in support of LD 814: An Act To Restrict The Daytime And 
Nighttime Killing of Coyotes.   
I have always felt that coyotes are a valuable part of our ecosystem and not only aid in 
disposing of carrion, but also keep rodent populations in check. The proposed No Killing 
Days from April 1st to September 30th, is a time when coyote pups/whelps are born, 
taught by their parents on where and what to hunt; year round killing of coyotes is not 
only inhumane, but is also detrimental in maintaining a healthy coyote social structure. 
Orphaned pups either die or loose the training of their elders, and often become a 
problem to human communities. 
Although I am not a hunter, I do support Maineâ€™s hunting traditions.  However, the 
inhumane killing of coyotes serves no other purpose than to satisfy the adrenaline rush 
that human predators experience. The act of killing, just for the sake of killing, should not 
be what Maine stands for. 
Please support the passage of LD 814.  Thank you all for allowing me to express my 
overwhelming support of this bill. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Andre F. Ouellette
