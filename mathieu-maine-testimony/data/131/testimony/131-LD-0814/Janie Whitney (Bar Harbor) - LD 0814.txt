LD 814
Dear Committee Members,
I am writing to ask you to support L.D. 814. We need to honor the role that these 
critical predators play in maintaining stable wildlife populations, controlling the 
spread of disease, and encouraging healthy ecosystems in our state. Coyotes, like 
other wild animals in Maine, should be managed through established limited seasons 
and allowed the opportunity to raise their young in peace.
Sincerely,
Janie Whitney
