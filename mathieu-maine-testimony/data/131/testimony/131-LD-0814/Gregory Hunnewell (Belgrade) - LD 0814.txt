To Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee, 
 
 Thank you for allowing me to submit testimony to your committee regarding LD 814 An act to 
Restrict the Daytime and Nighttime Killing of Coyotes. 
 
 I am writing to let it be known that I oppose this bill and feel that it will do irreparable harm to 
our deer herd, and further allow the coyote population to encroach on our urban areas. From what I can 
see reading this bill and viewing who the sponsors are, this is most likely targeting the time of year that 
we have the highest number of tourists along our coast and in our woods. I feel it is a great tragedy that 
you would put the value of the tourist dollars above maintaining our deer herd and protecting the 
livelihood of our farmers. To close the season to hunt coyotes at this time of year is a tragedy. 
 To make the hunting of Coyotes out of season a criminal offense with a loss of license and a fine 
is absolutely unthinkable. Nothing like letting the proverbial Fox into the henhouse.
