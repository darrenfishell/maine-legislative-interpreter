I do not think it is an ethical hunting practice to hunt an animal while it is trying to 
feed and protect its young.  We don't hunt other animals during this time because we 
give them a chance to raise their families and teach the pups how to survive.  There is 
no real value to killing coyotes, their pelts are not of value and people don't eat them.  
So we are just killing animals for the sake of killing.  This is not hunting.  Science 
indicates that hunting coyotes is not the way to control their populations and it 
actually makes it worse.  Coyote populations will stabilize when coyote packs are 
stable.  There will be less moving around and packs will inhabit areas and hunt their 
normal prey.  I think that the state of Maine should follow the example of MA and 
NY and have a limited coyote hunting season similar to what we have for black bears.
It makes sense and it makes hunting more ethical.  Thank you.
