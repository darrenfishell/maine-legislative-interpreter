LD 814
Thank you committee members for your time today. My name is Jamie Arute and  I 
live in Rockwood, Maine.  
I am in support of LD 814 the Act to Restrict the Daytime and Nighttime Killing of 
Coyotes. 
I personally have heard accounts of hunters speaking about killing coyotes by having 
their dogs chase them for many miles, then they rip them apart, killing or leaving the 
pups in their den to starve to death. This is not ethical hunting. Right now it is a free 
of all. As an ethical hunter, I would say that even though you can take an animal does 
not mean you should. Pup season should be off limits. 
Giving them a season will allow the pups a chance to survive and be taught how to 
hunt properly by their parents. This will help with control of rodents, and to keep deer
from over consuming on farmland and forest by keeping them on the move. I support 
ethical hunting 100% and truly believe it is time that Coyote has its own protected 
breading season. Thank you
