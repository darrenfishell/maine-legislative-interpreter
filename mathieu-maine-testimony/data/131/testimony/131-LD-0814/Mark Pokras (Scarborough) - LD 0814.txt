Dear Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Committee on Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife 
 
As a wildlife veterinarian, I am writing in support of Maine LD814: An Act to Restrict the 
Daytime and Nighttime Killing of Coyotes. 
 
In the coming decades, Maine faces a wide variety of challenges to the health of our wildlife, the 
environment, and our human population.  With the absence of larger carnivores like cougar and 
wolves, coyotes play an important ecological role helping to maintain healthy ecosystems and 
species diversity. They help to limit rodents, and the populations of other mesocarnivores (like 
raccoons and foxes), maintaining biodiversity and reducing transmission of some infectious 
diseases. 
 
I recommend that Maine joins other states like Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey in 
limiting the hunting season for coyotes. 
 
Thank you for your attention. 
 
Sincerely,
