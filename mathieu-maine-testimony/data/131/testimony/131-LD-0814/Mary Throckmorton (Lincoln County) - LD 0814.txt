LD 814
Dear Committee Chairs and members,
I am writing today to ask you to vote in favor of LD 814.  I , like many of those who 
are submitting testimony in favor of this bill, recognize the importance of biodiversity
and the presence of predators as an integral part of ecosystems.
The lobbyists which oppose LD 814 submit bills after bills, year after year to gain 
more hunting opportunities at the expense of Maine's wildlife. While this bill seeks 
specifically to constrain attempts to eradicate coyote from Maine's ecosystems, other 
predators are also at risk with unlimited take during their seasons. 
As a landowner  of 25 years,located in the midst of tens of thousands of acres of 
undeveloped land, I can testify that it is possible for a small group of dedicated 
hunters to clean out large areas of predators. Once their goal is achieved, they move 
on to another location. I have seen grouse and hare targeted in this fashion as well, 
and no longer see signs of them on  walks down the road.
I am not anti hunting. I am in favor of restraint when it comes to Maine's wildlife 
management practices, and LD 814 will help achieve that process.
Thank you
