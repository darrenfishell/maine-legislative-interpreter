LD 814
I am in favor of the passage of LD 814.  There are a multitude of reasons. I do not 
believe it is right to hunt any animal with virtually no limits on the season, the method
or the number of animals killed.  Coyotes deserve protection during the period in 
which they are raising their pups and teaching them how to survive.  Coyotes eat 
rodents which are carriers of the Lyme Disease spreading ticks.  Coyote pups should 
not starve to death in their dens waiting for parents who are not returning as they have
been killed by hunters.  Coyotes deserve limits on the hunting season just as most 
other species in Maine already have in place.  Please pass LD 814.
