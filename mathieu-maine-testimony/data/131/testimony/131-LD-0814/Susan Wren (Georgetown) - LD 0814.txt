This is my testimony in support of LD 814 An Act to Restrict the Daytime and the 
Nighttime Killing of Coyotes.
I am writing in fervent support for LD 814 introduced by Rep. Lynne Williams of Bar Harbor.
Coyotes are an ancient apex predator in our region and across the continent. They provide an 
essential link in the chain of life, death and the public health by keeping the population of deer in 
check, thereby reducing the number of accidents on our roads and cases of Lyme disease caused 
by deer ticks.
Coyotes are rearing pups in the spring and they are being taught to hunt in those next few 
essential months, learning their role in our ecosystem. Restricting the hunting of coyotes during 
the time suggested in LD 814 will help the young survive, learn to hunt, and keep the population 
strong for their role as our sentient, family oriented, top predator in Maine.
Other animals have short hunting seasons in our culture. I believe the coyote deserve the same 
protection and thoughtful management.
Sincerely,
