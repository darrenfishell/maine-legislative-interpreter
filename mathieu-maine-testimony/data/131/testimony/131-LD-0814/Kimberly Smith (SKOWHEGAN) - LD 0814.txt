Dear Members of the Committee:
I’m writing to you as a lifelong Maine.  This year I will turn 50 years old.  I was 
raised in a family of non-hunters and non-land-owners so my experience with wildlife
is limited.  I acknowledge I’m probably not the typical person testifying on behalf of 
our coyote population.
I write today as a person concerned that disruption of natural patterns is dangerous 
and should be done with careful intention.  There is divine intelligence of natural 
ecosystems so in all cases, wild animals should be disrupted as little as possible, 
especially mothers and their young.  We honestly cannot calculate the ripples and 
repercussions when entire litters of pups die of starvation alone in dens.  It affects 
systems and rhythms that transcend our understanding.
We live in a world of wildly escalating violence in general.  Opinions abound about 
whether and how much humans should encroach on, control, and possess parts of the 
natural world.  This issue is new to me and the members of this committee are better 
read and researched than I am.  I was invited to add my voice to the conversation so I 
humbly request that you consider restricting daytime and nighttime killing of coyotes.
Thank you for your time and attention.
