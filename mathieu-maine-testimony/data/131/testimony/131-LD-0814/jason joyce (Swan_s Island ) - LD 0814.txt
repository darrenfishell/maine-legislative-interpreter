LD 814
 Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
 I am writing today in opposition to LD 814. 
 As a registered Maine Guide and as a multi-generation Maine lobsterman I understand the 
need to properly manage natural resources and the damage that can come from allowing a 
non native predatory species to negatively impact various other native species.
 Many areas in our state have populations of Deer in decline due to the pressures brought by 
an overabundance of Coyotes.
 Maine's citizens who have depended on a healthy deer herd to put food on their tables 
expect the Dept. of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to continue ensuring future generations of 
Maine's hunters have a robust deer population maintained by controlling the coyote 
population. 
 Maine's Registered Guides also depend on the length of the current season to prevent the 
overpopulation of coyotes from creating a hardship on their mostly small family businesses. 
Reducing the coyote season puts those businesses and guide families at risk. 
 Maine's farmers who struggle with predation by coyotes will suffer more livestock loss if this 
bill is not stopped. 
 
 Lastly, as the population of coyotes is allowed to increase, it hands no benefit to the coyotes.
Decreasing current reduction efforts will expand the range of coyotes in search of game that 
becomes depleted by their increasing population eventually leading to starvation as 
coyote/human interactions increase while they target domestic pets.
 I encourage members of this committee to oppose passage of this bill.
