LD 814
Good day - My name is Chris and along with my wife and I we are farmers/gardeners 
in Albion. We are writing to recommend that LD 814 ought to pass. 
Between our land and our surrounding properties, we have access to several hundred 
acres of woodland, ponds, and rivers. We are outdoors people, and are very much 
aware of all wildlife around us. Since owning our land over a decade ago, we have 
NEVER heard nor saw any sign of "coyote". However, we are constantly dealing with
an excessive population of deer that are destroying our property (gardens, trees, etc) 
and the surrounding woodland. The 'coyote' population, from our observations, 
appears to have largely disappeared due to excessive killing. I have read the testimony
from some of the submissions and see that some in favor of passing have included 
photos for shock value that show this animal behaving as it should, keeping the 
invasive deer population in check, while not mention the killing and suffering they 
impose while hunting the deer themselves, not to mention the torture and suffering 
they cause on the coyote.  We cannot continue to allow the unchecked reckless killing
of coyote as the deer populations are getting out of control. Please, vote 'ought to pass'
on this piece of legislation. Thank you.
