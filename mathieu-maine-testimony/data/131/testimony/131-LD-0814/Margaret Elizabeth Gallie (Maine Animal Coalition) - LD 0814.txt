RE: In Support of LD 814 An Act to Restrict the Daytime and Nigh ttime Killing  of 
Coyotes  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representat ive Landry , and members of the Committee on Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife : 
My name is Beth Gallie and  I am Pres ident of Main e Animal Coalition.  Maine Animal 
Coalition is a not for profit dedicated to the elimination of animal abuse and e xploitation 
through education, advocacy, and example.  
Maine Animal Coalition supports LD 814 An Act to Restrict the Daytime and Nigh ttime 
Killing  of Coyotes . We support thi s bill because we believe that both predat ors and prey 
species are vi tal compone nts in a healthy ec osystem.  
If passed , this bill  would make it illegal to kill coyotes from Apr il 1st to September 30th . 
This is the time when coyotes teach their offspring  to be effective hunters  of a variety of  
small prey , such as mice , squirrels  and even amphibians and birds.   
It is our understanding that coyotes may kill a fawn in spring or a deer in deep snow  of 
winter , but coyotes most often eat small pre y.  Allow ing year -round  hunting of  coyotes 
disrupts th eir n atural behavior  and we ask you to end this practice.
