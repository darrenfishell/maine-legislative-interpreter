Good day all,
  I am writing to say that I strongly oppose this legislation. The current rules that are in place 
regarding the hunting of coyotes are working. To limit the hunting season to just 6 months 
(during the day) and nighttime to 3 &1/2 months, will undo all that's been done to help the 
States deer heard get to where it is now. This bill would severely limit the ability of Maine 
sportsmen and woman to keep Maines coyote population to a publicly acceptable level. I and 
many others would very much like to see an ought not to pass vote from the IF&W committee 
(You). Thank you all for your time and your service. If I can be of any assistance or if I can 
answer any questions feel free to contact me.
