CLAIRE PERRY - TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT of LD 814
Senator Landry-Senator LaFountain and Honorable Members of the IF&W Joint 
Standing Committee:
I was a participant on the IF&W Department’s ten-year Coyote Management Plan at 
the sub-committee level 2020-2030.
I expected three things from these meetings:  
    • Willingness of all members to fully participate
    • Civility of discussions and expression of opinions
    • Current science being the foundation of management policy; not 
 emotions or special interests
                                                                                                                                          
For the most part, members were respectful and worked well together.  Best of all, we
had five wildlife biologists on this committee of varying experience and credentials. 
Two of the five specialize in canids: Dave Persons and Geri Vistein.  
Here is what I want you, the committee members, to know: Four out of five of our 
committee’s wildlife biologists,  strongly supported the proposal: A Closed Season 
for Coyotes. 
The reasons, and length of this season were brought up, and discussed.  LD 814 is an 
exact reflection of that discussion and vote.  
Lastly, let me assure you; I am not anti-hunting.  And I can also assure you what I am 
for: Science-based Wildlife Management Policies. 
This, along with my own personal experience of farming with a stable coyote family, 
is why I am here today in strong support of this bill. 
 Thank you for the opportunity to share this information with you.
