LD 814
 I'm writing in opposition to   Ld 814  as a life long outdoorsman's  who has seen what
the  coyotes have done to the deer herd in  Northern Maine to the personal lose of pets
by friends from these killing machines. These coyotes were not native to Maine 
arriving in the late 70s and by the late 80s were in a lot of the state and continue to 
increase in numbers today.  WE should be  doing what ever can be done to control 
these killing machine before we lose not lonely the family pets but a small child or in 
the case in Canada a hiker .
