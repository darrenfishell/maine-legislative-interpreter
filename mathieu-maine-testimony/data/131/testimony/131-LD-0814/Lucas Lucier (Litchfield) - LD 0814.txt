Lucas Lucier
Litchfield
LD 814
My name is Lucas Lucier.  I am a farmer in Litchfield, ME and an avid hunter.  I 
oppose LD 814 because it limits my hunting opportunities during the year.  Hunting is
a part of the rural heritage here in Maine and LD 814 takes away from this heritage.  
Much of the economy here in Maine is based on the rural character of the state and 
any law prohibiting rural Mainers from being "rural Mainers" should not be endorsed.
We have chickens and pets running around on our vegetable farm.  Although we have
not lost any of our animals to coyotes, our neighbors have lost chickens to coyotes. I 
use the current coyote hunting season to keep the local population in check.  I do not 
want to be limited in my ability to protect my livestock and pets from predation.  I 
encourage all to reject LD814 to protect rural life here in Maine.
