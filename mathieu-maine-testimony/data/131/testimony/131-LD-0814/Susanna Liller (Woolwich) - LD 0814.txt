LD 814
Greetings,
Thank you for your service to the people of this state. I am writing to you as a 
concerned Maine citizen who wishes to see LD814 passed. Coyotes are our apex 
predator and are important to the balance of the ecosystems in Maine. Right now there
are no protections for coyotes in Maine. This means that they are persecuted 
constantly through the year and also during pup season which is April -September. 
This doesn't give the mother coyotes adequate time to safely raise their young. Also 
"hounding" is a very horrific blood sport and dishonoring to traditional Maine 
hunting.
Please vote to pass LD 814. Thank you.
