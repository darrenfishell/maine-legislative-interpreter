I am writing in support of LD 814 An Act to Restrict the Daytime and Nighttime 
Killing of Coyotes. 
This is a very important act that will support the health of our rural ecosystems, of 
which the coyote is an important part.
When allowed to live naturally, coyotes create family systems that are 
population-limiting because they are territorial, according to wildlife biologists, 
including Dr. Robert Crabtree of Yellowstone Ecological Research Center. To stop 
the killing of coyotes April 1 â€“ Nov 30, would allow for their family units to stay 
intact, at least during the crucial pup time. When one or both parents are killed during 
these months, the pups are left to starve, or their family system is distorted and unable
to function properly.
In nature everything is interconnected, and carnivores are important parts of our 
ecosystems.
It is time that we make the shift to a more humane world, and to see that we can live 
cooperatively with the other species that inhabit our world, for the benefit of all.
