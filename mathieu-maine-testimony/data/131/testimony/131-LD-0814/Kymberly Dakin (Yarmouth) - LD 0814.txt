LD 814
As I am a citizen of Maine, and a person deeply concerned about our natural 
environment, I wish to relay my concern regarding the harmful exploitation of 
coyotes in our state, and encourage you to support Bill LD 814: An Act the restricts 
the Daytime and Nighttime Killing of Coyotes. This act will make it illegal to kill 
coyotes during their most vulnerable life cycle: April to September 30th, when they 
are raising their pups.
When the parents of young coyotes are killed, desperation takes hold of the survivors.
Without the guidance of their absent parents the pups are not able to be taught to hunt 
for rodents and other small mammals.They will instead go after easier, slower 
livestock, thus fueling a vicious cycle.  
 
We know now that coyotes are a “keystone” species, with significant positive impact 
on surrounding ecosystems. Coyotes keep deer on the move preventing them from 
consuming much or all of their food source resulting in starvation and the destruction 
of Maine’s natural environment.     
Our skyrocketing rates of Lyme disease, and the devastating impact on our economy, 
is correlated directly with Keystone species loss. In addition, the over grazing by deer 
can also lead to the significant loss of native plants, critical to bees, birds and 
butterflies. This has impact on agriculture and allows for invasive plants to gain 
ground. 
Please vote to give coyotes and their families a fighting chance to help heal our 
ecosystem. I strongly urge you to support: LD 814: An Act the restricts the Daytime 
and Nighttime Killing of Coyotes.
