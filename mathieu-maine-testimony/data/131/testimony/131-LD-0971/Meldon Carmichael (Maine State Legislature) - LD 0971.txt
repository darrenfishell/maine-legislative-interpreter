Testimony in Support of: 
LD 971, “An Act to Establish the Income Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents ” 
Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation. I am Meldon Carmichael, State Representative for House 
District 18. I am here today in support of LD 971, “An Act to Establish the 
Income Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents. ” 
I Want to thank you for taking the time to consider this bill. This legislation does 
not target any one income bracket, it does not increase the tax burden on any 
Maine families or fuel inﬂation thus having a negative effect on Maine’s 
economy. 
What this legislation does do is create a vehicle Where surplus monies collected by 
the state can be returned to the people of Maine. 
In addition, this legislation has no ﬁscal note because if there is no surplus it has 
no funding. There is a cost, however, to collecting this revenue. 
Most constituents that I have spoken with would rather this money be used to 
reduce future taxes than go through the expense of returning it to them. 
Thank you for your time and I’l1 be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
District 18
