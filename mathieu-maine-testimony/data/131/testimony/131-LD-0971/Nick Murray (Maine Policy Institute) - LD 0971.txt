Testimony in Support of LD 971:
“An Act to Establish
the Income Tax Relief Fund
for Maine Residents”
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on Taxation, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as director of policy for
Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a nonpartisan, non-profit
organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic freedom in Maine.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 971.
This bill is simply sound tax policy. It builds in automatic rate reductions
triggered by revenues received by the state higher than the budgetary growth limitation
factor. It would ensure that Maine people, not the State, are the first to benefit when
they are forced to pay more than is necessary in taxes.
Contrast that to the budget proposal facing legislators today. Governor Mills and
her allies are proposing that the state ignore the growth limitation factor, in play for 20
years but never-before triggered, and instead spend 98% of all estimated revenue. There
could not be a wider difference between these approaches.
Over the last four years, the Maine state government has grown
inflation-adjusted spending per capita by 10%. If Gov. Mills got her entire budget
wishlist, this would grow to 20% over six years. This sort of spending growth trajectory
is unsustainable. At some point, DC inflating the dollar will not help us; Mainers will be
on the hook for the state’s profligacy.
The time to institute long-term tax reform is now. Please deem LD 971 “Ought To
Pass” and chart a course of real growth for Maine. Thank you for your time and
consideration.
