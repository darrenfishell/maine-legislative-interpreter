March 23, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Ann Danforth and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonproﬁt 
legal aid provider working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support of LDs 667 and 843 and in opposition to LDs 
835 and 971. 
While all of these bills would make structural changes to Maine's income tax law, two of the bills — LD 
667 and 843 —would create more equity in our tax code and generate revenue that could be invested 
into programs and services for people who need it most, while two — LD 835 and 971 —would make our 
tax code more regressive and increase economic inequities in our state. 
Families in Maine are struggling 
Maine Equal Justice has seen first-hand that families across the state, and in particular, families with low 
income, are still suffering from the economic impacts of the pandemic. According to the most recent 
Census data, more than 1 in 10 (11.5%) Mainers were in poverty in 2021‘ — that is, a family of four living 
below $27,479 annually? That's a little over $500 a week. 
Record high inﬂation coupled with high energy costs, a pre-existing and worsening housing crisis, rising 
food costs coupled with the loss of SNAP emergency allotments, and the unwinding of continuous 
enrollment for MaineCare members are huge factors stretching Maine families and their budgets?4

LD 667 and LD 843 would help build a more equitable tax system and enable the state to invest in 
critical programs and services. 
We have the opportunity with LDs 667 and 843 to create a more equitable future for the children and 
families in our state. An important ﬁrst step we can take is to adopt a tax code that increases taxes on 
the wealthiest - many of whom became even wealthier during the COVID-19 pandemic — while reducing 
the tax burden paid by Mainers with the lowest income who have been ﬁnancially harmed by the 
pandemic and ﬂuctuations in the economy. 
At Maine Equal Justice, we work closely with Mainers with low income who pay a disproportionate share 
of their income in taxes, even as they struggle to make ends meet. Taxes that are not based upon 
income, such as sales and property taxes are assessed regardless of ability to pay, meaning low-income 
families end up paying a larger share of their income in taxes than wealthy families. Increasing income 
taxes on the wealthiest Maine households is a progressive approach that asks those who have the most 
to contribute more back to their communities than households struggling to maintain economic security 
- like so many working and middle class Mainers. It also enables us to use that revenue to invest in 
programs and services that really matter to Mainers, and particularly, Mainers with low income. 
LD 835 and 971, on the other hand, would exacerbate income inequities in our state by reducing or 
phasing out income taxes entirely. The income tax is the largest single source of state revenue and is the 
most equitable way to secure the revenue Maine needs to meet the state's current and future needs. 
Reducing the income taxjeopardizes Maine's ability to pay for critical services and programs that beneﬁt 
us all, and also makes our tax code less fair. 
Rather than an across the board tax cut, like those proposed in LDs 835 and 971, we encourage this 
committee to think about targeted tax policy solutions like the Child Tax Credit, which focus tax relief 
and invests in the low and moderate income families who need it most. 
Conclusion 
We have the opportunity to invest in programs that will keep more Mainers healthy; address housing 
insecurity; and increase access to education and training to make more families economically secure and 
better meet the workforce needs of the 21“ century. LDs 667 and 843 would move us closer to this goal, 
while LDs 835 and 971 would move us in the opposite direction. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on these bills. I am happy to answer any questions you might 
have.
