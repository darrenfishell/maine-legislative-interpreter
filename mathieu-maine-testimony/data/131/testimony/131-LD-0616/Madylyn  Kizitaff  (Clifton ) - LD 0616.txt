Hello, my name is Madylyn Kizitaff. 
My heart breaks that we have gotten to the place where we are having to stand up 
against something so obviously evil and wrong. 
I have two boys of my own and the thought makes me sick to think that if LD1619 
passes thousands of little innocent lives like my boys could be murdered all the way 
up to 9 months. Yes I said murdered… that is exactly what abortion is. No matter 
what the case is for the “need” or “want for an abortion, there is hundreds of longing 
parents who will never have a baby of their own. Let’s be more pro active in 
providing the support and needs for the women/families that deem their babies as 
unwanted or an inconvenience. Along with making adoption easier. LD 1619 does 
NOT belong in Maine. 
Psalm 139:13-17“For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my 
mother’s womb. 
I praise you because I am FEARFULLY and WONDERFULLY made; your works 
are wonderful, I know that full well. 
My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was 
woven together in the depths of the earth. 
Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your 
book before one of them came to be. 
How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭139‬:‭13‬-‭17‬ 
Thank you.
