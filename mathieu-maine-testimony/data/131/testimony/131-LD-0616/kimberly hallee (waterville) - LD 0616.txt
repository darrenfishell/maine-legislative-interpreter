I support LD 616  An Act to  Protect Health Care Professionals  Providing 
Reproductive Health Care Services. I am a Registered Nurse, hold a va61id 61ME RN
License and provided 43 years of nursing service to the Kennebec Valley Region. 
Quality healthcare including health education, insurance coverage and comprehensive
follow through and follow-up for all care rendered should be   IMHO the right and 
privilege of ALL MAINE CITIZENS. Certainly, the dedicated professionals that 
provide reproductive health care should also be ensured they have a safe environment 
and protection to perform their vital services. 
Thank you. Kimberly Hallee 12 Gray Street Waterville ME 04901
