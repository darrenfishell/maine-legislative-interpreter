My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, I am a dad, a faithful Catholic, a member of the 
Knights of Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
I am testifying in opposition to LD 616. 
This bill would make Maine a sanctuary state for activist abortion providers. The bill creates a special 
exception to encourage and support abortion providers in other states to break that state’s law related to 
abortion. It requires that medical malpractice insurance providers do not consider any licensing or other 
infraction related to abortion when providing coverage in Maine. 
Please consider opposing this terrible legislation and vote ought not to pass.
