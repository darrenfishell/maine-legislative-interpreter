Vice President, Maine Chapter of the Freedom from Religion Foundation  
 
LD 616 
 
Members of the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, this is 
testimony IN FAVOR OF LD 616.  
LD 616 directly supports Maine residents’ right to a legal abortion by protecting medical 
professionals from retaliation originating from out-of-state. That retaliation, based on laws from 
outside Maine’s jurisdiction, would be a bad precedent. It makes no sense to allow such 
retaliation against a person who is performing an act that is legal in Maine.  
The needs of state law demand that entities from other states should not be able to enforce their 
state laws within a state which has contrary laws, and the needs of reproductive health demand 
that there be no barriers to the performance of lawful reproductive health measures.  
Please protect Maine state jurisdiction as well as public health, and pass this bill. Thank you.
