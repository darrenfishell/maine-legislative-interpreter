Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee,
I am submitting written testimony on LD 616 (An Act to Protect Healthcare 
Professionals Providing Reproductive Health Care).
I am a mother and grandmother living in Southern Maine. I support LD 616 and want 
to ensure that Maineâ€™s healthcare professionals remain free to perform crucial 
reproductive services, such as abortion, to patients living within and outside of the 
state of Maine with no legal, insurance, or other repercussions. 
I am grateful that I received safe, affordable abortion and family planning services 
when I needed it. That care made it possible for me to be a mother when I was ready 
to be one, not before. 
Thank goodness (and Democratic law makers and voters and activists) my abortion 
providers were safe and supported by laws that secured their ability to perform this 
important healthcare service. We need to make sure they are protected.
I urge you to vote yes on LD 616.
Thank you,
sincerely,
