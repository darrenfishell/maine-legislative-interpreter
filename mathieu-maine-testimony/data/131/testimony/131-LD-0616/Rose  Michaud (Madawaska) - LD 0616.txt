LD 616
I would like to voice my opposition to LD 1619 as well as all other bills that promote 
the ending of a precious life whether of advanced age or a child in the womb.  Even 
more egregious is the expanding of the availability of abortion at the point that a child
is born naturally.  As a nurse who has spend her career providing care, I can not 
support any legislature that would bring harm and end a life purposefully.  Abortion 
has brought so much pain to so many women who have been physically hurt by the 
procedure and even worse, to have lived their lives regretting that abortion, they were 
told would solve all their problems. I, as a Mainer, am ashamed of the politics of 
Governor Mills and her desire to expand abortion, her disregard for human life and 
failure to listen to the people of Maine.  At a National Prayer Breakfast in 
Washington, DC., Mother Theresa told the audience, which included President 
Clinton, his wife, Vice President Gore and his wife, "If we accept that a mother can 
kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill each other?....Any 
country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence
to get what they want."  Wise words that we should all take to heart!!  Thank you.
