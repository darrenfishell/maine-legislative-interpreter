To the members of the committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Services:
You and I know the rhetoric: “It’s my body”, “it’s not a baby – just a clump of cells”, 
“it’s my right to choose”, etc. Once we get past all of the arguing and politics and 
rhetoric we come to the essence of the truth: A CHILD'S LIFE IS AT STAKE. She 
cries out to you to help her live.  He wants to be loved and held.  A Maine Citizen is 
asking, begging, crying out -- to all of you-- to live.  Do take to heart this cry for help.
Every effort to ban, regulate, legislate, and remake policy only hurts Maine, the nation
and ultimately each one of us personally.  Killing is still a crime.  Let us not make it 
legal.  In Maine, in our nation, on our planet.
