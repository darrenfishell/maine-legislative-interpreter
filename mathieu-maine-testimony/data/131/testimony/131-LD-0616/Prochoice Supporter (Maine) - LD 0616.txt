LD 616
I write today in support of LD 616, and thank the sponsors of this bill who have 
brought it forward to the HCIFS Committee. Since June of 2022, a woman's right to 
obtain safe access to an abortion is under deep threat. While I would gladly supply 
statistics and studies that show how limiting abortion access for woman has worse 
outcomes than non-limiting factors,  unfortunately opponents of this issue would not 
listen and do not care. So I feel it necessary to show my support of this legislation by 
clearly stating to those opponents, shut-up and mind your own business. A woman 
who is struggling to decide on whether to abort a child is already dealing with enough
hurt, loss, financial, and medical challenges. When it comes to making such a hard 
decision, the argument of one's religion, who is against abortion, you do not matter to 
someone who deciding what they want to do with their own life and reproductive 
rights. Your opinions whether to a point or not are irrelevant, and have nothing to do 
with what the person is deciding for themselves. I urge the committee to support LD 
616 and all other legislation that protects a woman's right to choose. Thank you for 
hearing my testimony.
