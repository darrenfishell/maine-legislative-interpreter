LD 616
Dear Committee Members,
Please Do NOT pass LD 616 or 935.  Each state should choose it's own laws and 
Maine should not provide a way for people of other states to cross their borders to 
have an abortion.  This is about making money and not about women's rights.  Most 
abortions are not to save the life of the mother but rather a form of birth control.  
Maine's healthcare providers should be held accountable if they are providing 
abortions for women from other states.
Thank you, Michelle Homchuck
