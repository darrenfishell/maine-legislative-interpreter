LD 616
I am writing in support of LD 616.  Health care providers should not be criminalized 
for helping patients and carrying out the duties for which they have been trained in a 
medical setting. whether they reside in Maine or reside elsewhere and of necessity 
travel to Maine for abortion services. I am appalled at the Supreme Court’s decision 
that has resulted in chaos for so many people – health care providers and patients 
seeking care – and those who might assist them. 
Please pass this Bill and keep Maine a place where reproductive health care is not 
against the law!
