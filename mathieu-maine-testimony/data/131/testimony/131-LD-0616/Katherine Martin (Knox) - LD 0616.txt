Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and 
Financial Services, LD 616 - “An Act to Protect Health Care Professionals Providing 
Reproductive Health Care Services”, May 1, 2023.
Representative Kuhn, Senator Brenner, Senator Carney, Representative Gattine, 
Representative Moonen, Representative Perry, Representative Pierce, Representative 
Pringle, Representative Sayre, Representative Zager, and Members of the Committee:
My name is Katherine Martin. I am testifying in support of LD 616.
I believe this bill is critical for the State of Maine to firmly establish set law in view 
of the Supreme Courts decision that the rights allotted to women regarding their 
health and reproductive decisions be determined by each state’s legislature. It makes 
me sad that our Supreme Court does not recognize this as an act of establishing 
religion.
As a citizen of Maine, and of the United States I worry about the erosion of my 
religious freedom. The overreach of a religious minority determined to impose the 
beliefs of their group on the nation is scary. That these beliefs are being expressed as 
economic threats to the livelihood of profession health workers is not acceptable in a 
‘free’ society. Private industry should not have a deciding power over people’s 
careers. 
I fully support the state of Maine establishing insurance regulation protecting abortion
care providers as an essential part of overall health care. 
It is my hope that doing so will protect Maine citizens from the insurance industry 
acting as a regulating authority. 
Thank you for this protective piece of legislation. I shall hope it passes.
