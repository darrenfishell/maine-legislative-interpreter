Good afternoon Senator Baldacc1, Representatlve Meyer, and members of the Comm1ttee on 
Health and Human Serv1ces My name 1s Deb Ibonwa, I use she/her pronouns, and I am a Pohcy 
& Legal Advocate at Mame Equal Justlce We are a c1v1l legal a1d orgamzat1on and we work 
w1th and for people W1th low mcome seekmg solutlons to poverty through pohcy, educatlon and 
legal representatron I am speak1ng today 1n oppos1t1on to LDs 182, 183, 268, 364 and 454. 
Those who need help from the General Asslstance (GA) program are among those who face the 
deepest levels of poverty and the greatest rlsk of homelessness and hunger 1n our state As of 
2022, 80% of GA funds are granted for rental asslstance These b1lls propose to add restnctlons 
to houslng asslstance rather than expand 1t Wl’11l6 we are 1n the m1ddle of a houslng cr1s1s 
In late 2012, a Workmg Group convened by the Leg1slature and appo1nted by the DHHS 
Comrmssloner spent hundreds of hours exammmg the GA program to 1dent1fy savmgs and 
cons1der how to rmprove the program Mame Equal Just1ce’s Publ1c Polrcy Dlrector served on 
the Workmg Group along wrth others, 1nclud1ng the Mame Mun1c1pal Assoc1at1on, mun1c1pal 
welfare d1rectors, and representatlves of the Department They came up w1th a thoughtfully 
negotrated comprom1se and the1r recommendatrons were largely adopted by the 
Leg1slature Mame Equal Justlce d1d not l1ke every part of that comprom1se, but 1t was Just that, 
a comprom1se It 1s dlsturbmg to see many of the same proposals that were carefully consrdered, 
debated and re] ected by that group reappear here today, as they d1d seven years ago before bemg 
largely re] ected by the Leg1slature Another s1m1larly constltuted GA stakeholder group was 
convened 1n 2019 and 1ssued a report 1n 2020 1 
Th1s report recommended that the Department 
1ncrease staff 1n the ofﬁce provldmg overslght to mun1c1pal1t1es, prov1de add1t1onaltra1n1ngto 
mumclpal GA admmlstrators, and mcrease relmbursement to mumc1pal1t1es for emergency

general assrstance above the approved maxlmums Nerther of these stakeholder groups 
recommended any of the pol1c1es contamed 1n these b1lls 
LD 182 would rmpose an arbltrary 9-month t1me l1m1t to GA that W111 lead to more homelessness and hunger 1n Mame commumtles The l1m1t apphes to those who are “capable of worklng, ” but provldes no deﬁmtlon of what th1s means, th1s 1s Slll)_]€ClI to oprmon, abuse, and 
mlslnterpretation LD 182 would worsen raclal d1spar1t1es 1n Ma1ne’s homeless populat1on as 
well Whrle Black people make up 1 8% of the total populatlon, they make up 34 6% of the 
homeless populatlon, a d1spropo1t1onal1ty that W111 only grow w1th the proposed restnctrons 1n 
LD 182 2 The end of federal emergency rental asslstance has left many Malners wlthout help or 
affordable hous1ng optrons These fam111es cont1nuously face the threat of ev1ct1on for non- 
payment of rent Already nearly 60% of extremely low-mcome households, over 20,000 
households, pay more than 50% of thelr monthly mcome towards rent, a threshold wh1ch HUD deems severely rent burdened — and th1s b1ll would make thlngs worse 
Furthennore, Ma1ne has already been down th1s path Dunng the 2012-13 State F 1scal Year, GA used for hous1ng assrstance was l1m1ted to a 9-month cap 3 
Thrs prov1s1on allowed for hardshrp 
exceptlons for people w1th mental or phys1cal cond1t1ons or who had a pendrng apphcatlon w1th the federal Socral Securlty Admlmstratlon or any other emergency that may cause undue hardshrp and unnecessary costs, as determlned by the mun1c1pal1ty Thrs prov1s1on was put 1n 
place for a year wrth a sunset at the end of that perlod so that 1ts 1mpact could be evaluated In 
fact, no one lost hous1ng assrstance as a result of th1s prov1s1on as everyone who needed 
asslstance for th1s long a perlod of t1me fell w1th1n the except1ons 1n the statute for d1sab1l1ty or 
emergency However, when th1s prov1s1on was 1n effect, hundreds of needy people l1ved 1n fear 
that they would lose therr housmg even though they cont1nued to be 1n great need As a result, 
the Legrslature allowed th1s prov1s1on to sunset wrthout renewal 
It 1s also rmportant to note that t1me l1m1ts 1n pubhc beneﬁt programs do not lead to greater 
workforce part1c1pat1on There are many reasons people may not be able to work Those rnclude needmg to care for a famlly member who 1sn’t a dependent (such as an aglng parent or a spouse w1th a serlous health lssue), lack of transportatlon, or health lssues that 1mpact the hours they can work or the type of work they can do Bemg able to meet your baslc needs, as GA assrsts people 1n dolng, 1s a work support that ultlmately leads to greater workforce part1c1pat1on over t1me 
LD 183 would take away access to GA — the asslstance program of last resort — spec1ﬁcally for famlhes w1th clnldren who, after 60 months rece1v1ng TANF, st1ll ﬁnd themselves 1n need of assrstance Research shows that famrhes that reach the TANF t1me l1m1t have work-l1m1t1ng mental and phy§cal health problems that are d1sproport1onately h1gher than those that do not reach the t1me l1m1t, a lower educatronal level, and other s1gn1ﬁcant barners to

employment 4 Many remam deeply econom1cally lnsecure after TANF term1nat1on and TANF 
tenn1nat1on has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes for ch1ldren5 
In 2012, the General Asslstance Work1ng Group consrdered the questron of how to treat fam1l1es 
who have reached the TANF t1me l1m1t After careful consrderatlon, ne1ther th1s group nor the 
2019 stakeholder group recommended taklng away access to the GA program for these 
fam1l1es Instead, a maJor1ty of the members of the 2012 working group members recommended 
add1t1ons to the 11st of except1ons to the TANF trme l1m1t that targeted some of the Lmderlyrng 
reasons why a fam1ly m1ght st1ll need ass1stance after 60 months, mcludlng tak1ng 1nto 
c0ns1derat1on srgnlﬁcant barrlers to employment6 
Accordlng to the Mame K1ds Count Data Book,7 1n 2021 nearly 34,000 Ma1ne ch1ldren (13 8%) 
l1ved 1n poverty 8 
Nearly half of those ch1ldren were consldered to be l1v1ng 1n extreme poverty 
w1th 1ncome 50% or below the poverty threshold Poverty rates for ch1ldren 1n Washmgton 
County, P1scat1qu1s County, and Oxford County are greater than 20%, and other rural count1es 1n 
Marne have chrld poverty rates of 15-20% 9 Th1s leglslatron would result 1n more econom1c 
rnsecurrty, homelessness, and hunger for ch1ldren and parents who most need our support The 
1mpacts of l1v1ng 1n poverty as a chrld are l1felong Th1s b1ll w1ll result 1n addrtlonal harm for 
Mame clnldren 
LD 364 appears to address a matter of program el1g1b1l1ty - spec1ﬁcally statlng that someone 
who has not exhausted avallable and potentlal resources 1s deemed 1nel1g1ble for GA Under 
current law, when a GA appllcant does not take advantage of an avarlable resource, they are 
deemed 1nel1g1ble and cannot recelve ass1stance untrl they use that other ava1lable resource 1° 
LD 364 would not only make someone 1n th1s s1tuat1on 1nel1g1ble, but they would also be 
pun1shed and proh1b1ted from rece1v1ng asslstance for at least 120 days, regardless of whether 
they subsequently take advantage of the avallable resource and would thereby become el1g1ble 
under current law well before 120 days are up Th1s prov1s1on also pena11zes someone for 
“abandonmg ” a resource even though that may have happened well before they appl1ed for GA 
and at the t1me they had no knowledge of the 1mpact of that act1on on the1r GA appl1cat1on 
People turn to GA when they are unable to afford the most basrc needs they have to surv1ve- 
thrngs lrke shelter and food Penal1z1ng someone for not knowmg the rules 1n advance of needmg 
to apply for th1s help 1s cruel Current law 1s adequate to ensure those who need help have 
exhausted all poss1ble resources they could use ﬁrst

LD 268 would requrre that a person be a resldent of a mun1c1pal1ty w1th the 1ntent1on to rema1n 
and wrth no other resldence for 45 days before they can be el1g1ble for GA Th1s arbrtrary 
el1g1b1l1ty requrrement w1ll make 1t more challenglng for low-1ncome Ma1ners who need help to 
pay for shelter, food, or other bas1c necess1t1es — result1ng 1n lncreased homelessness, hunger, 
and poor health 
Th1s would be d1fﬁcu1t to document grven that many people who requlre GA are already 
unhoused or are hous1ng 1nsecure They may be “couch surﬁng” w1th fr1ends or fam1ly wh1le 
they try to ﬁnd hous1ng or l1v1ng 1n the1r car, a tent, or on the streets Wrthout proof of where 
they are l1v1ng, they would be 1nel1g1ble for GA Glven the h1gh rates of houslng msecunty belng 
experlenced by Ma1ne people across our state, th1s harsh pol1cy proposal W111 result 1n real 
l'13IdSh1p for many 
LD 454 l1m1ts access to GA to those who have been a resrdent of Ma1ne for 180 days or more 
Appl1cants must prov1de proof of res1dency — and a post ofﬁce box or ma1l dropaddress 1s not 
adequate Many people who struggle w1th hous1ng 1nsecur1ty rely on post ofﬁce boxes or marl 
drops because they want to have a cons1stent address to recerve 1mportantma1l When someone 
1s struggllng w1th hous1ng 1nsecur1ty, 1t can be a challenge to hold onto paperwork for 180 days, 
wh1ch would be requ1red to demonstrate when the1r res1dency began If you d1dn’t know th1s 1sa 
requlrement for GA or that you would need GA 1n the future, you mlght not have proof that 
would satlsfy the requrrements 1n th1s b1ll at the t1me you need to apply That could result 1n 
needlng to estabhsh state res1dency by wa1t1ng an addrtronal 180 days dur1ng wh1ch you may be 
exper1enc1ng homelessness, hunger, and health 1ssues 
For people who are unable to work for any reason, 1nclud1ng asylum seekers who are unable to 
get work authorlzatlon due to federal wa1t1ng perlods, people w1th health 1ssues, people W1th care 
respons1b1l1t1es, people who are unhoused, or people wlthout adequate transportatron, th1s change 
1n law would result 1n slgnlﬁcant hardshlps because they may have no other source of support to 
meet the1r baslc needs 
GA supports people who are exper1enc1ng emergenc1es and people who are trylng to bu1ld a new l1fe 1n our state Nerther of those populatrons should be excluded because of when they moved here or whether they have proof of res1dency go1ng back far enough 
For these reasons, we urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LDs 182, 183, 268, 364, and 454 
Thank you for the opportumty to prov1de comments today I would be glad to answer any 
questlons that you may have and can be avallable for the work sess1on
