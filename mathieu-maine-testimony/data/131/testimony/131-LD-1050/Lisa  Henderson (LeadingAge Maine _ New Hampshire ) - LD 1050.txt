LD 1050
LeadingAge Maine & New Hampshire supports LD 1050. 
Our association represents mission-driven aging services providers of housing and 
long-term care who are greatly challenged by persistent labor shortages in ALL 
positions including direct care roles but also in such areas as dining, housekeeping, 
maintenance, etc. Asylum seekers could be activated much more quickly to fill these 
positions were Maine to have a federal waiver accelerating their timeline for 
permissible employment. 
Maine needs every tool available to add to our labor pool, and this bill stands to create
a pathway for qualified and motivated individuals to contribute to a healthy, 
functioning aging service sector and Maine's economy overall.
