LD 1050
Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing on LD 1050, 
“Resolve, Directing the Department of Labor to Request a Federal Waiver to Allow 
Presumptive Work Eligibility for Asylum Seekers”, public hearing to be held on 
March 21, 2023.
Senator Mike Tipping, Representative Amy Roeder, and Members of the Committee:
My name is Ann Dodd-Collins and I am a resident of Portland.  I volunteer with 
Greater Portland Family Promise and Preble Street and I am testifying in support of 
LD 1050, “Resolve, Directing the Department of Labor to Request a Federal Waiver 
to Allow Presumptive Work Eligibility for Asylum Seekers”.
As a volunteer who works with asylum seekers, I am well aware of the length of time 
it takes for those who are seeking asylum in Maine to get work permits.  These are 
people who came to Maine seeking a better, safer place in which to raise their 
families.  They want to work.  Many of them have skills Maine desperately needs.  
Everywhere I turn I see “Help Wanted” signs.  I read stories and hear news accounts 
about businesses that cannot find the workers they need.  Yet the length of time it 
currently takes to get a work permit forces families to rely on General Assistance 
vouchers, takes a toll on their dignity and self worth, and leaves important jobs 
unfilled.  This is wrong.  
I encourage you to direct the Department of Labor to request a waiver and allow asylum 
seekers who want to make Maine their home an opportunity to get to work.  It’s a win-win.
Sincerely, Ann Dodd-Collins
