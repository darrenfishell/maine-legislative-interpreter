Good
afternoon
Senator
Tipping,
Repr esentativ e
Roeder ,
and
members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
Labor
and
Housing.
My
name
is
J ob y
Tho yalil
and
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
Maine
Business
Immigration
Coalition
(MeBIC)
neither
f or
nor
against
LD
1050.
MeBIC
is
Maine’ s
onl y
r esour ce
dedicated
to
pr o viding
inf ormation,
education
and
adv ocacy
on
immigration
and
r elated
issues
fr om
and
f or
the
business
and
economic
perspectiv e .
W e
kno w
that
immigrants
ar e
par t
of
the
solution
to
Maine’ s
shor t-
and
long-term
w orkf or ce
shor tages.
Most
people
seeking
asylum
bring
education,
skills,
and
exper tise
with
them
and
ar e
able
and
eager
to
w ork.
Unf or tunatel y
the y
m ust
wait
f or
at
least
six
months
bef or e
the y
ar e
f ederall y
authorized
to
do
so .
F or
this
r eason,
w e
v er y
m uch
suppor t
the
intent
behind
LD
1050,
but
w e
cannot
suppor t
it
due
to
the
fact
that
f ederal
immigration
la w
does
not
allo w
f or
the
type
of
waiv er
f or
which
this
r esolv e
calls.
I
ha v e
consulted
with
MeBIC’ s
f ounder ,
Beth
Stickne y ,
who
is
an
immigration
attorne y
and
a
longtime
exper t
on
immigration
la w
about
this.
It
is
clear
that
ther e
isn’ t
an y
language
in
the
f ederal
Immigration
and
Nationality
Act
that
allo ws
f or
a
waiv er
of
this
kind,
as
m uch
as
w e
wish
ther e
w er e .
That
said,
w e
do
think
it’ s
g ood
f or
state
leaders
to
be
speaking
out
on
this
issue .
Congr ess
needs
to
hear
fr om
political
leaders
fr om
states
acr oss
the
countr y
that
our
cur r ent
immigration
la ws
do
not
meet
our
economic
or
human
needs.
While
ther e
is
nothing
that
the
f ederal
ex ecutiv e
branch
can
do
under
f ederal
la w
about
w ork
authorization
f or
asylum
seek ers,
if
the
Committee
decides
to
mo v e
f orwar d
with
this
r esolv e ,
w e
r ecommend
amending
it
to
r equest
that
Congr ess
tak e
legislativ e
action.
Thank
y ou
f or
the
oppor tunity
to
pr o vide
input
on
this
impor tant
issue .
