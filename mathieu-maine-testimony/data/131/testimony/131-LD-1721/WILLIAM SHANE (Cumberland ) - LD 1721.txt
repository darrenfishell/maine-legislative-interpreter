Re: LD 1721, An Act to Create Transitional Housing Communities for Homeless  
       Populations in the State  
 
Dear Senator Pierce and Representative Gere, and Committee members:  
 
Please accept this letter as my testimony in support of LD 1721, An Act to Create 
Transitional Housing Communities for Homeless Populations in the State.  
The crisis in housing can no longer be absorbed in one city or one region within 
our state. This bill can begin to successfully orchestrate the multitude of needs 
connected to a solid, humane and sustainable housing solution for all of Maine.     
Without a change in policy, we will see increasing numbers of people with no 
hope for an opportunity to become productive members of our great state. Safe 
homes, realistic transitions, and real opportunity all begin with a solid plan. 
LD 1721, if given the support needed to succeed, will be the start of a real long-
term solution to transition from frustration and chaos to success.          
I apologize I could not testify in person, but thank you for the opportunity to 
share my support for LD 1721. 
 
Respectfully Submitted, 
 
William R. Shane, Town Manager 
Cumberland, Maine
