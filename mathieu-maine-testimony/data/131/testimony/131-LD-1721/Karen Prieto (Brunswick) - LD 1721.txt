LD 1721
Greetings, honorable members of the Joint Select Committee on Housing.
My name is Karen Staples Prieto. I grew up in Topsham, and now live in Brunswick 
after many years out of state. Thank you very much for your vote last week to 
advance LD 2 - Act to Address Maineâ€™s Housing Crisis, and for your long hours in 
preparation for the summer break.
Please also consider voting "ought to pass" for  LD 1721 - Act to Create Transitional 
Housing Communities for Homeless Populations in the State. 
Unlike LD 2, which targets long-term housing for individuals with chronic 
homelessness, LD 1721 is intended to address temporary housing for up to 24 months 
at a time. Through a presentation series at Prince Memorial Library, "From Africa to 
Maine," I have learned that transitional housing is a missing link in our system that 
would be particularly beneficial for asylum seekers who have recently joined our state
community. Without transitional housing options, organizations working with New 
Mainers have needed to rely heavily on hotels - which I'd guess is more expensive 
and less conducive to resource-sharing.
Personally, I view welcoming New Mainers as not only a moral duty, but also an 
opportunity to increase our work force as our existing population progresses to 
retirement. Having reliable housing options while our new neighbors establish 
themselves seems like an important piece of the welcoming process. 
So I ask you to please support LD 1721. Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely, Karen Prieto, she/ her/ Mx
