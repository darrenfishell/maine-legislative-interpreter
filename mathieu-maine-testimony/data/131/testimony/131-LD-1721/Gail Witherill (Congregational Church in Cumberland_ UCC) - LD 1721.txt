RE:LD 1721 , An Act to Create Transitional Housing Communities for Homeless Populations in the State  
 
Dear Distinguished Members of the Committee on Housing, 
 
I am writing to urge you to support LD 1721..An Act to Create Transitional Chousing for Homeless 
Populations in the State.  As a volunteer, I have been working with homeless families in the Greater 
Portland area who are in shelters.  Temporary, short-term housing in shelters is one thing, but due to 
the lack of housing in the area, the temporary has not been temporary.  Imagine an atmosphere where 
there is no privacy, where you are sleeping in a room with dozens of strangers..some with coughs and 
colds..some with small children and babies crying out in the night. Then imagine being in such an 
atmosphere for months.  Living like this is not conducive for good health, let alone being able to get a 
good nightâ€™s sleep to be able to navigate a new life.  Shelters are full, few apartments or even rooms are 
to be had.  What a novel idea to create a fund at the state level to incentivize the planning and building 
of transitional housing, both for families and for singles, around the state service hubs.  Transitional 
housing will allow the current homeless in shelters to move into a space of their own to get their feet 
under them, to obtain the services they need, and to use the two years of transitional housing to 
prepare themselves for independent living.   Please support LD 1721. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gail Witherill
