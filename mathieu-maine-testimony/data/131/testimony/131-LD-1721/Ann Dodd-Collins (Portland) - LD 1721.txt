LD 1721
Senator Teresa Pierce, Representative Traci Gere, and Members of the Committee:
My name is Ann Dodd-Collins.  I am a resident of Portland, and I am testifying in 
support of LD 1721, “An Act to Create Transitional Housing Communities for 
Homeless Populations in the State”.   I volunteer with Greater Portland Family 
Promise and Preble Street and this past winter I also volunteered at the State Street 
Church winter warming shelter.  
We all know that the housing crisis in Maine is severe and that it is state-wide.  
Transitional housing is desperately needed in Maine and the proposed Transitional 
Housing Community Construction Program Fund would help to make transitional 
housing throughout the state a reality.  This bill checks all the boxes.  It provides 
funding for transitional housing.  It meets housing needs throughout the state, not just 
in high population areas.  It provides wraparound services such as job training, health 
care, and English language classes.  And it provides stability for families and 
individuals who are homeless.
I urge you to support LD 1721 and vote Ought To Pass.
