I am completely opposed to this bill. To empower the school system and its 
employees to usurp parental rights by circumventing and/or eliminating open 
communication therein is a complete over reach of governmental power.  To equate 
pronoun use or misuse within the home with child abuse is to destroy the sacred 
family unit which constitutes the very foundation of our society. Furthermore, to 
assume that a minor child has the mental and emotional maturity to determine 
unequivocally that they are misgendered is in and of itself negligent. To encourage 
and groom a child in this capacity is abusive and often has long term psychological 
ramifications. 
The school systems should be working hand in hand in a transparent manner to help 
every child to succeed. This effort to create a barrier between a child and his/her 
parents will only serve to alienate more families from public education. Inevitably 
enrollment will decline as families find alternate means of educating their children. 
As enrollment declines so does funding. 
I urge lawmakers to rethink this law. The legislature would be better served by 
investigating the insidious nature of social media which is infecting our children like a
plague. It's no coincidence that the rise in children identifying themselves as other 
than binary or heterosexual coincides with the pervasive use of the internet in all ages.
I'm totally in favor of investigating and determining why this is happening in order to 
minimize the existential threat to the future of our society.  To do so would be a more 
long lasting benefit to the families of Maine.
