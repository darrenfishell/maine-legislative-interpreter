As much expertise as social workers may have in their field of study, but parents are 
the BEST experts in the very individual needs child will have as they grow up. This 
rule change intentionally excludes parents and should not be considered by the DOE. 
Parents have not been allowed in schools for the past several years. Children are 
facing so many challenges academically and mentally. Especially now, we should be 
focus on rebuilding relationships between parents and their local school 
administration â€” not putting new barriers in place. Kids need their local schools, and 
they also need their families. Please say no to Chapter 117.
