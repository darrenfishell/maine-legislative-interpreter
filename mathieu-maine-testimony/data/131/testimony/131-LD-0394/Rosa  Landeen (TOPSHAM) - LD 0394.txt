LD 394
To the committee of Education and Culture affairs. I'm worrying on regards to LD 
394 and the review of chapter 117.
I feel everything regarding our children should never be kept from the parents.  As the
parents are responsible for their health and medical treatments. Please consider to get 
rid of the extra policy's regarding social workers.
