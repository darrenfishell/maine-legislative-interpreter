As a parent, legal guardian, mother, grandparents raising three sets of grandchildren I 
do not support, teachers, counselors or social workers from not sharing information 
regarding a child in there care at school, counseling sessions or groups. We, the 
caregivers must be made aware of any and all issues, decisions, or concerns that the 
children we are raising have.  It takes a village to raise children but not a divided 
village. It takes everyone to be honest, truthful and forthcoming with any information 
regarding a child and all aspects of their development to all the parties and parents 
who have legal rights to the child.
Please protect our children and parental rights.  Schools are not the judgement or final
deciding factors of our children, the parents and guardians are.
