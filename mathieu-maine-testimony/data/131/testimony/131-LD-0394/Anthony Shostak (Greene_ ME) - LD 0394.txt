Dear Legislators,
Please vote NO on Chapter 117 to enshrine in law the rights of parents to be 
informed. Parents need this so that they can be prepared to make health decisions for 
their children. It is unconscionable that school employees hide vital information about
a child’s health or mental health from those who know the children best and who have
the legal responsibility for their care. Recent news from across the state has shown 
that activists embedded in the schools seek to advance their harmful agenda by 
pushing children to begin gender “transitioning” without the knowledge and consent 
of parents. This amounts to child abuse, and it must stop.  
Please support parental rights by voting NO on Chapter 117.
Sincerely,
Anthony Shostak
