Upon reading this bill, I noticed some discrepancies in the language that the 
committee overlooked. Under school social worker, the definition limits this job to 
only people who have been approved by the LCSW board and have an LSW, LCSW, 
or LMSW licensure.  Unfortunately, this cuts out an important group of people: 
LCPCs. 
The national board of School Social Workers (SSWAA) accepts LCPCs on equal 
footing with LCSWs within their ranks and as full members.  At this time, we are 
short on LCSWs in the state of Maine, and making this limitation will continue to 
narrow the availability of School Social Workers within our state.  I implore you to 
consider adding LCPC language to this section of this legislation.
