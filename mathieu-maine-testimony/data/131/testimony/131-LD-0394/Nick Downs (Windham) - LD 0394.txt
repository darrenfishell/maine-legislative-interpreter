I do not agree with the proposed chapter 117. School administration does not have the
right to override a parentâ€™s decision regarding the wellbeing of their child or withhold 
information from parents about their child. There is no need to be pushing this 
ideology on children and families. It is unethical and criminal to pressure kids to go 
through with procedures that will affect them for the rest of their lives.
