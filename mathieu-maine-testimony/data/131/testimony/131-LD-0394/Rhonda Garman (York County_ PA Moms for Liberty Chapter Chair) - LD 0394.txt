I am a parent in York, PA. I strongly agree with parental transparency! We as parents,
have to give written permission to allow our children to receive Tylenol or any 
medical care while in school, yet this bill will allow teachers, social workers, admins, 
etc. to grant permission to OUR children for puberty blockers, chest binders and 
hormones?!? Without even consulting the parents or the parents even knowing about 
it at all? These children will 100% regret this and will hold resentment towards those 
who weren't there to protect them. These children will more than likely suffer from 
depression for the rest of their lives. These children can't even choose their own 
bedtimes, yet can decide, after being brainwashed and groomed into mutilating their 
bodies. This is a money making machine and nothing more! This is pure evil! 
PLEASE do the right thing and DO NOT allow a bill that takes parental rights away. 
We brought these children into this world, it is NOT anyone else's right to make 
decisions for them. We will NOT co-parent with the government! 
Thank you for your time!
