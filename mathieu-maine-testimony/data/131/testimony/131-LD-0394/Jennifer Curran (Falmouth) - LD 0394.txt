LD 394
My name is Jennifer Curran and I am a trauma therapist.  I currently work with both 
children and adults many who are neuro-divergent and LGBTQIA.  I am writing in 
support for LD 394.  
As a therapist, confidentiality with a client is so very important.  Individuals are less 
likely to share about challenges in their life during therapeutic sessions if they believe
that information could be shared with others outside that session.  Specifically, 
children who believe that their thoughts could be divulged to their parents are less 
likely to share their thoughts freely.  To go a bit deeper, children who are discovering 
their authenticity ...leading them to believe that they are part of the LGBTQIA 
community can face a difficult task of communicating this to their family/friends, 
some which might not accept or support this authenticity.  The pressure of being 
different can put elevated stress on that child placing that child at additional risk for 
suicide and self harm.

As a private practice therapist, I am well aware that many of our first line social 
workers work with children in our public school system.  Children who feel safe 
going to these social workers can process feelings, feel accepted, and work through 
some of these intricate discoveries.  When I work with a child, that child is my client. 
Unless they are going to hurt themself or others, what they say is private under my 
care.  This allows a child to share freely, and know they are safe.  How can we expect 
our school social workers to do their good work if we do not allow them to offer those
children, under their care, the same support.
Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.  I thank you for your 
time.
