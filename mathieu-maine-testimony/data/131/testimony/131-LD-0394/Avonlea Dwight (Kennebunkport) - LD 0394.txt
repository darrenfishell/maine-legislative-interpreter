LD 394
We will tell children they cannot protect themselves, that they cannot consume, that 
they cannot travel, that they cannot wield; but to tell them that they were born in the 
wrong body, to infer that they are not born already perfect and as who they are meant 
to be… that is now right? Never. To bypass the parent and keep secrets from them in 
a PUBLIC setting, even worse. What parent would not sue? What would drive a 
public school to such secrecy? Only misdeeds can lead to such a need for a bull such 
as this - one that further fractures families in a time when family is needed most. Have
school workers been so misunderstood their whole lives, they must project the same 
misunderstanding onto innocents? 
Pronoun use is irrelevant to the comfortable and healthy upbringing of a child. 
Skewing a child’s self-imagine is treacherous to their well-being. Separating their 
growth from their parents, and labeling parents as abusers for not conforming to 
pronoun use a glaring. It is nothing short of torture inside a mind and soul to those 
who are most pure. I vehemently oppose LD 394 and will never submit my child into 
any school system that plans to implement such misdeeds. The school system will 
crumble under such obviously ridiculous and abhorrent law.
