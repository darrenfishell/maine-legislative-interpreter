LD 394
Senator Rafferty, Representative, Brennan, and members of the Education and 
Cultural affairs committee, my name is Vanessa Figgers. I am speaking in opposition 
to LD 394. Children are the responsibility of the parents and from birth, the love a 
parent has for their child goes beyond any feeling a stranger or teacher can have for a 
child. As a Mother of 3 myself, I am willing to protect others from harming my child, 
physically or emotionally, with my WHOLE LIFE. When the government pushes into
or in between the relationship between mother and child, they cannot fathom any 
benefit they may think they can provide better than me (the mother). To assume any 
treatment with hormones or gender related ideology, as an educator, is not within the 
bounds of your duty. If there is mental health issues, a parent will find a provider 
(medically) if necessary. To place yourself into that role, is out of bounds and a 
violation of trust between educator and the pupils parent/provider. I hope you will 
consider this testimony and put yourself in the parents shoes. With all the 
detransitioning horror stories coming out and suicides plaguing our youth in our 
current society, it has been shown that the relation between hormonal imbalances and 
suicidal/self hate/self harm is clear. To create a space of secrecy between a child and a
parent is unethical, immoral and irreparable. Breaking the trust between parent and 
child causes devastating damage to your community and your credibility and the 
future of the child. Please consider the harm you will cause to thousands of children if
you pass this legislation and the fact that you are starting a trend that will effect future
generations from ever wanting to have kids if they know the schools will destroy the 
bond, values and traditions/trust that are instilled by parents with their children 
throughout their lives. Thank you.
