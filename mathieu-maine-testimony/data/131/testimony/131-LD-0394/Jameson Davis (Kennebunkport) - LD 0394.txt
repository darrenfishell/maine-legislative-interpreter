I’d like to submit my concerns and absolute disagreement with this bill. Parental 
rights are sacred and in adjusting the existing avenues for abuse controls and 
protections to include transgender issues, this is destroying the family unit as well as 
creating illegal channels of control of children. If this does pass, you better believe 
parents across the state will be suing individual districts and the state for breach of 
control,  over bearing Actions, child abuse, kidnapping, you name it. We will look 
forward to pulling our children from the public school system, crippling the system 
with decreased funding, exposing radical agendas to control the next generation, I 
could go on. You claim this bill is to protect children, but it’s just another way of 
grooming children in this popular and trendy fad we are seeing. These kids are not 
even old enough to vote, join the military, drink alcohol, etc. But you’re taking 
parents out of the decisions of life changing and altering possibilities. That is child 
abuse.
