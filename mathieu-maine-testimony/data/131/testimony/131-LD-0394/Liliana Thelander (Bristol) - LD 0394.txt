Bristol, Maine 
Thank you, committee members, for spending your time to review the 
expectations for school staff members in this bill LD 394; I know your job is 
not easy. 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
committee, I am asking you today to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 394 
My name is Liliana Thelander. I am a mom and have had three children in 
the school system. 
I am aware that there are predators out there, that may present a risk to my 
children. 
The text in Chapter 117 being addressed by this bill LD 394 that allows 
“Privileged Communications ” is especially disturbing to this mom, andI 
have a request: Please do not prevent me from protecting my kids by 
allowing social workers, school counselors and administrators to keep 
secrets from me. 
Please make it very clear that, as a parent, I am to be kept fully informed 
and involved in any kind of counseling efforts taking place with my 
children. 
Some of the members on this committee are parents and or grandparents. 
Do you honestly believe school counselors and administrative staff should 
be encouraged to have your kids keep secrets from you? 
Please remember that in schools, academic learning should be the priority. 
Academic learning should never, as suggested by the Maine Education 
Commissioner Pender Makin, take a backseat to social and emotional 
learning. 
Parents should not be considered the problem simply because we're asking 
questions. Parents are the solution. No one knows more what is best for their 
children than their parents! 
Thank you for considering my testimony. Please vote Ought Not To Pass 
Thank you, 
Liliana Thelander
