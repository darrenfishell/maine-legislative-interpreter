I do not believe it is ever necessary for a school counselor, with or without, a masters 
degree  as stated in the 1989 bill.  Parents have the right to any and all information 
regarding their children no matter where that information comes from: schools 
including teachers, administrators, counselors as well as physicians.  For school 
counselors and teachers to integrate any form of indoctrination without open 
discussion is certainly not what was intended.
Please educate our children to think critically, research thoroughly and thoughtfully 
without coercion.  Students and parents should be allowed to speak freely and openly 
about their concerns. 
Chapter 117 affirms the right of a broken education system to propagandize for no 
benefit to the children.  Please keep this from becoming law.
