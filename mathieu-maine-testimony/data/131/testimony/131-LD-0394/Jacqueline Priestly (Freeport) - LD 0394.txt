I vote in opposition of this bill. Under the eyes of the law, a parents' first and most 
important responsibility is to keep their children safe. This means protecting their 
mental and physical health. In addition to providing the basic physical needs of life, 
parents are also responsible for teaching children moral values, mutual respect and the
difference between right and wrong. A child is not capable of making mature adult 
decisions on their own, it's why this dynamic and other age restrictive laws exists in 
the first place. We as parents are solely responsible for our children's proper and safe 
upbringing, not the government and certainly not a school social worker. The role of a
school social worker is to work with the parents, not in secret, on issues involving the 
children to make sure their experience in school is a positive one. This bill would 
drive a wedge between families and would not positively serve the child in the long 
run.
