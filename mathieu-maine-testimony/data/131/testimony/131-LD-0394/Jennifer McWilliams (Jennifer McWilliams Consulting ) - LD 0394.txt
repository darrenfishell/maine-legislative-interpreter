I am writing to urge you to say NO to Chapter 117. Chapter 117 is a blatant abuse of 
power to undermine and usurp parental inherent rights. This bill supports and protects
public employees in building emotional/trusting relationships with minors and 
keeping secrets from their parents- this is the definition of SEXUAL GROOMING. 
This bill exploits and takes advantage of innocent children for a radical ideology 
while weaponizing the government against parents who disagree. This bill is a 
violation of our constitution and must be REJECTED.  You do not have the right to 
make life-altering decisions for children. Say NO to Chapter 117.
