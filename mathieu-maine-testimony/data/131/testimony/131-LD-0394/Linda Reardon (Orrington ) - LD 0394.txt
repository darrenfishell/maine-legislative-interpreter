This is an outrageous bill and should never be passed. Parents are responsible for their
children NOT school counselors or teachers. When something is wrong with a child 
the ONLY responsibility of the school is to tell the parents. If there are no parents itâ€™s 
the responsibility of the child protective services to intervene NOT school counselors 
or teachers. The child protection system will provide privacy as they are trained to do.
This is a gross over reach of any school. Schools should care more about teaching our 
children the basics of education rather then political correctness and misguided views
