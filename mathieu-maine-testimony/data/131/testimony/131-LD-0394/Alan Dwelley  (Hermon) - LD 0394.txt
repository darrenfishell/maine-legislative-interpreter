LD 394
I oppose LD394 and urge all legislators to oppose the bill as well.  I am specifically 
opposed to Chapter 117 of the bill.  It removes and further erodes parental rights 
involving the education and well being of their children.  It gives counselors extreme 
latitude in counseling a child regarding serious issues without the requirement to 
notify the parents and without the parents involvement.  This is wrong and should not 
be allowed.  Some of the areas of counseling can result in permanent life changing 
events, and parents must be involved in any such process.  Many states are currently 
expanding parental rights regarding their children’s education.  Through this bill 
Maine would be eroding parental rights.  This is totally wrong and must be opposed.  
If, anything, parental rights regarding their children’s education should be expanded, 
not eroded.   If this bill is passed Maine will have chosen to a path toward the 
elimination of the family unit.  That would be wrong on so many levels and I demand 
better of our elected officials.
