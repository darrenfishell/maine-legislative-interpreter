LD 394
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan & members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, Please do NOT pass Chapter 117/LD 394 because it will 
ruin a child's upbringing, as well as destroy the relationships between children and 
their parents.  This will harm the close and ever so important bond between a parent 
and child.  Parents need to be looked up to, listened to, and seen as the first and 
foremost protectors in the eyes of their kids.  This, if it were to pass, would ruin that 
essential bond of trust and support.  Children without the guidance as well as 
protection of their parents, are in great danger of being ruined, manipulated and 
brainwashed.  Parents must maintain their role as the primary guide and protector of 
their children, like they have been for centuries.  Please consider the implications of 
children growing up without the wholesome values and guidance of their parents, 
consider how lost, confused, corrupted and unhappy they will be if this cultish 
ideology is allowed to indoctrinate them.  Taking parents out of the equation, 
allowing others to secretly push their ideology on innocent na√Øve children is not the 
solution.
