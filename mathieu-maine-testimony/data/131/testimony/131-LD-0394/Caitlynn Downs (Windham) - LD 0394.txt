Please do not take away parents rights from us! No one knows what is better for my 
child than myself. I made my children from my own body - their hearts, their lungs - 
all the way down to their toes. No school counselor or social worker should be 
allowed to take my rights away from me or my husband. We do not support this 
movement and hope that it will not pass. Thank you.
