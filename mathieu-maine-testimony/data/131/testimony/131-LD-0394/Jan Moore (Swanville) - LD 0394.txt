LD 394
To whom it may concern,
I am writing in with extreme concern about LD 394. 
I am concerned on how this allows me as a
Parent to be fully involved with my child. I am the parent and my
Childs supporter, protector, and the one who looks out for the well being of my child. 
If this allows information to be kept from me, you are taking away the vital part of my
Childs well being. You take away my responsibility, and my right as a parent to know
whats best for my child. I urge you to consider the dangerous consequences of this 
and stand with parents and not allow this to happen.
Thank you!
