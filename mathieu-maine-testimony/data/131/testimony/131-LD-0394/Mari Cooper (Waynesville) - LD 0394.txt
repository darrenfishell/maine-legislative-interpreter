As a parent and a teacher, children do best in life when their first relationships, those 
with their parents or legal guardians, are supported.  Even in families struggling with 
problems, such as addiction, violence, or mental illness, addressing these issues first 
and foremost within the family whenever possible will lead to better outcomes.  
As a woman who suffered from body and gender dysmorphia as a young teen, at a 
time when the only option was watchful waiting and therapy, I can say without a 
doubt that myself and my family are grateful that schools, teachers and therapists did 
not pit us against each other. It was not always easy, but I am a happy healthy mother 
and grandmother
