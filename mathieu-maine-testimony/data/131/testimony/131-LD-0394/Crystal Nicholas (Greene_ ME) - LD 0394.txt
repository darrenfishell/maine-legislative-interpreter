Dear Legislators,
Please vote NO on Chapter 117 to affirm parental rights.  Parents must be fully 
informed about the physical and mental health of their children if they are to fulfill 
their timeless duty to care for them. The idea that a school guidance counselor or 
psychologist could keep secrets form parents--and encourage a student to do the 
sameâ€”with the blessings of the legislature and courts beggars comprehension. 
We have seen too many cases, right here in Maine, of school employees  overstepping
their authority and the trust the public has placed in them by encouraging students to 
create secret alternate identities to be used at school. Sometimes, they have even 
pushed children onto the path of gender transitioning, which can include chemical 
interventions with harmful life-long consequences, such as infertility, osteoperosis, 
and depression.  These people should be locked up by the legal system, not protected 
by it. 
To protect children and affirm the rights of parents, please vote NO on Chapter 117.
