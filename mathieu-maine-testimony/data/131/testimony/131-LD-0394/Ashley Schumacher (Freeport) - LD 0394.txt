LD 394
As a substitute school nurse and a parent of a Maine public school student, I support 
the passing of LD 394. Respecting the autonomy and privacy of our young people 
simply makes sense. By passing this law and enacting the Department of Education’s 
chapter 117, specifically Section 2, Item F regarding Privileged Communication, the 
rules rightly recognize that parents/guardians do not always provide the safe space 
they should for children to express themselves. School should always be a safe place 
for the children of Maine, especially with the counselors and social workers who 
assist the most vulnerable in our communities. Students need to know that, outside of 
risk of harm to themselves or others, they can trust school counselors and social 
workers to keep the information they disclose private. A parent’s right to information 
does not outweigh a young person’s right to privacy and autonomy. Thank you for 
your time and consideration.
