Re: LD 394: Chapter 117 
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and respected members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs committee:
I am Nancy Hudak, a resident of Standish, and I am asking you to vote in favor of 
LD394. I believe some professional groups have offered clarifying language which I 
would also encourage you to adopt as part of the legislation as it goes forward to the 
full Legislature.
Chapter 117 was originally developed in the 1980s when the current rules made 
sense. At the time, there were only school counselors, who served all students with a 
general focus on academic, career guidance, some limited social/emotional 
interventions and counseling, along with social workers, who often served the special 
education needs of individual students as required by their Individual Education Plans
(IEPs) developed by their Pupil Evaluation Team (PET) under federal and state law. 
There were very few school psychologists and their time was often taken up with 
assessments of all sorts.
The world has changed in forty years and the enabling legislation needs to move with 
the times. 
All school counselors, social workers, psychologists, teachers, and administrators are 
licensed by the State of Maine. I trust their collective judgment.
Some commenters recently, however, seem to believe that “parental rights” are 
enshrined in law as superior to every other and that those “rights” mean they can 
control all aspects of their children’s lives. Even if that were true (it is not), they do 
not have the authority to control other students’ lives.  By opposing this bill and 
thereby limiting the services Maine’s education professionals can provide in the very 
few hours students are in school buildings, they are affecting the lives of Maine 
students statewide. 
I urge you to reject the calls to oppose this bill. Please send it along to the House and 
Senate with your recommendation for adoption.
