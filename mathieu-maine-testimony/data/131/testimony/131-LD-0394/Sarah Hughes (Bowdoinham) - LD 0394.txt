DO NOT pass Chapter 117. This is not acceptable, you do not tell kids to keep secrets
from their parents and schools definitely do not have the right nor should they have 
the authority to provide medical treatments to students. Stop this attack on our 
children and parents. The school systems are NOT the parents nor are they, 
co-parents! Stop this now!
The educational system is to provide a strong academic foundation in math, reading, 
writing, and science. Take a look at our test scores!
