Senator Rafferty, Representative, Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Amber Lavigne of Newcastle and today I am speaking in opposition to 
LD 3 94. 
In December of 2022 I discovered a breast binder in my child’s bedroom. After discussion with 
my child, it was revealed that a school social worker provided this, and a second binder to her 
sometime in October. It is important to notate that this social worker began working for the 
school system at the beginning of the 2022-2023 school year in September and had met with my 
daughter, at most, for two 30 minute sessions and one 10 minute “check in” prior to providing to 
her these breast binders. It is also important to note that this social worker never reached out to 
introduce himself to me as a person who would be working with my child in any capacity, nor 
did the school inform me of this supposed care. He told my child he would not share this 
information with me, her mother, nor did she have to do so. This resulted in my child spending 
months hiding binders and keeping secrets from her family, causing her distress. When I wasa 
child, I was taught by my parents and educators alike from a young age that no adult should ever 
encourage me to keep a secret, and if they did, that they were bad. 
I believe a goal of having social workers in our schools is to improve the mental health and 
wellbeing of our children and their families. If this passes, this is the kind of supposed care our 
children struggling with gender identity will receive. Assumptions were made with serious ﬂaws 
in judgement by a 26 year old social worker employed by AOS 93 schools. This has resulted in 
serious distress, not just for my daughter, but for her younger brothers, for me and her father, and 
for her stepparents. This has also resulted in a loss of trust for a family and their local school 
district, leaving us with no choice but to pull our child from the school system. This feels 
contradictory to the goal of placing social workers in our schools.
About the time these breast binders were secretly given to my child, I took her to the local walk 
in clinic on a Saturday, to be treated. The issues she had absolutely could have been the result of 
utilizing a breast binder. Because I did not know at the time that my child was utilizing one of 
these devices, I did not have that information to share with her provider. Though this was nota 
life-threatening problem, there was a gap in my child’s care due to secrets being kept from me, 
her mother. This could have resulted in _a much worse outcome due to the provider lacking vital. 
information regarding her health. There are no studies to date that outline minors making life 
altering decisions without the guidance of their parents results in positive outcomes. 
On Tuesday I ﬁled a lawsuit against the school for depriving me of my constitutionally protected 
right to make decisions regarding my child’s healthcare. I have submitted a copy with my 
testimony. Beyond this mistreatment of my child, this bill violates the rights of parents across the 
state and country protected by the l4“‘ amendment. The Supreme Court has consistently held that 
parents have a fundamental right to control and direct the education, upbringing, and healthcare 
decisions of their children. Do what is constitutionally right for the parents in this beautiful state 
of Maine.

Defendants . 
INTRODUCTION 
l. This is a federal civil rights action to vindicate Plaintiff Amber Lavigne’s 
fundamental constitutional right to direct the upbringing of her child. 
2. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held over the past century that one of the 
rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment is the right of parents to control and direct the care, 
custody, education, upbringing, and healthcare decisions, etc., of their children —-a right the Court 
has characterized as fundamental. 
3. Defendants violated that right by giving Plaintiffs 13-year-old daughter, referred 
to herein as A.B., a chest binder—a gannent to compress breasts to appear male—and by using 
gender-pronouns and a name not associated with A.B.’s biological sex, Without informing Plaintiff
Case 2:23-cv-0O158~JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 2 of 21 PagelD #12 
of these facts, or providing any process through which Plaintiff could express her opinion 
respecting these practices. 
4. Pursuant to its ofﬁcial policy, pattern, and practice Defendants intentionally 
concealed this infonnation —-information that any conscientious parent would rightly want to know 
about her child—from her, thereby purposely depriving her of the capacity to meaningfully make 
decisions regarding the care and upbringing of A.B. This policy, pattem, and practice also deprived 
Plaintiff of the capacity to exercise meaningful choice respecting A.B. ’s education, because such 
concealment deprived Plaintiff of information necessary to make an informed decision respecting 
which school is best suited to her family’s needs. 
PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE 
5. Plaintiff Amber Lavigne resides in Newcastle, Maine. She is the mother of A.B,a 
minor who at the time of the injuries recounted herein was l3 years old and a student at the Great 
Salt Bay Community School. 
6. Defendant Samuel Roy is, and at all relevant times was, a social worker employed 
by the Great Salt Bay Community School and provided counseling to A.B. Plaintiff is infonned 
and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Mr. Roy, in his official capacity, is bound by, and is 
authorized to implement, the policies of the Great Salt Bay Community School and the Great Salt 
Bay School Board, including those requiring concealment of information from Plaintiff. In all of 
his actions and omissions alleged herein, Mr. Roy was acting under color of state law and is being 
sued in this action in his ofﬁcial capacity pursuant to Exparte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).

believes, and on that basis alleges, that Ms. Berk, in her official capacity, is bound by, and is 
authorized to implement, the policies of the Great Salt Bay Community School and the Great Salt 
Bay School Board, including those requiring concealment of information from Plaintiff. In all of

sued in this action in her official capacity pursuant to Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). 
8. Defendant Kim Schaff is, and at all relevant times was, the principal of the Great 
Salt Bay Community School. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Ms.

Great Salt Bay Community School and the Great Salt Bay School Board, including those policies 
requiring concealment of information from Plaintiff. In all of her actions and omissions alleged 
herein, Ms. Schaff was acting under color of state law and is being sued in this action in her ofﬁcial 
capacity pursuant to Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. l23 (1908). 
9. Defendant Lynsey Johnston is, and at all relevant times was, the Superintendent of 
Schools for Central Lincoln County School System which is governed through an Alternative 
Organizational Structure [hereinafter AOS 93]. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that 
basis alleges, that Ms. Johnston, in her official capacity, is authorized and required to ensure that 
the Great Salt Bay Community School complied with the polices and rules adopted by the Great 
Salt Bay School Board and with state laws and rules, including those policies requiring 
concealment of information from Plaintiff. In all of her actions and omissions alleged herein, Ms.

Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/04/23 Page 4 of 21 Page|D #:4 
10. Defendant Great Salt Bay Community School District Board is the governing body 
for the Great Salt Bay Community School, which serves families in Damariscotta, Newcastle, and 
Bremen. The School Board is authorized to make all reasonable rules, regulations, and policies, 
consistent with law, for the management of the Great Salt Bay Community School. It is a jural 
entity with the capacity to sue and be sued. 
1 1. Plaintiffs action, ﬁled pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 
2202, seeks a declaration that the Great Salt Bay Community School Transgender Student 
Guidelines are unconstitutional insofar as they provide for the concealment of, or do not mandate 
informing parents of, a decision to provide “gender-af ﬁrming” care to a student which includes, 
but is not limited to, the calling of the child by a different name, the referring to the child with 
pronouns not typically associated with the child’s biological sex, and the giving of garments, 
including chest binders to ﬂatten breasts, along with instructions for use. This concealment of 
information is an injury to the Plaintiff caused by Defendants acting under color of state law. 
12. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 
1343(a)(3), and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. 
13. This Court is authorized to grant declaratory judgment under the Declaratory 
Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. 
14. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § l39l(b)(l) and (2), venue is proper in this judicial district 
because Defendants reside within it and the events giving rise to Plaintiffs claims occurred within 
it.

Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 5 of 21 PagelD #:5 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
15. Maine law requires every school-age child to “be provided an opportunity to 
receive the beneﬁts of a free public education. ” Me. Rev. Stat. Ann, Tit. 20-A, § 2(1). All children 
over 6 years of age and under 17 years of age must attend a public school, subject to certain 
approved altematives. Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A’ , § 5001-A(1). 
16. Beginning in September 2019 Plaintiff sent her minor child, A.B., to the Great Salt 
Bay Community School in Damariscotta, Maine. 
17. Plaintiff has two other children, C.D., and E.F. who are four and almost two 
respectively and will fall under Maine’s compulsory attendance law in two and four years 
respectively. 
18. Plaintiff was generally pleased with the education A.B. received at Great Salt Bay 
Community School and still would be sending A.B. to that school, if not for the unlawful actions 
herein alleged. 
19. Plaintiff also plans and intends to send C.D. and E.F. to Great Salt Bay Community 
School if the unlawful acts and omissions as alleged herein are remedied. 
20. On December 2, 2022, Plaintiff was assisting A.B. in cleaning A.B.’s room at home 
when she discovered a chest binder-—a device used to ﬂatten a female’s chest so as to appear male. 
Upon inquiry, A.B. explained that Defendant Samuel Roy gave it to A.B. at Great Salt Bay 
Community School and instructed A.B. on how to use it. See photos attached as Exhibit 1. 
21. Plaintiff had never been informed before that A.B. had been given a chest binder at 
the school or instructed about its use. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,
5
Case 2:23~cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 6 of 21 PagelD #:6 
that this was the result of the Great Salt Bay School’s blanket policy, pattern, and practice of 
intentional withholding and concealment of such information from all parents. 
22. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendant Roy 
gave A.B. the chest binder in his ofﬁce and toldtA.B. that he was not going to tell A.B.’ parents 
about the chest binder, and A.B. need not do so either. 
23. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendant Roy 
gave A.B. a second chest binder at the same time. See Exhibit l. 
24. Chest binders are not medical devices, but there are potential health risks associated 
with the wearing of such binders, including difﬁculty breathing, back pain, and numbness in the 
extremities. 
25. Sexual identity, gender identiﬁcation, and body image, particularly with respect to 
such sexual characteristics as the female breast, are vitally important and intimate psychological 
matters, central to an individual ’s personality and self-image, and a crucial element in how people 
relate to the world. The signiﬁcance of such matters is even greater with respect to young people, 
particularly teenagers going through puberty. Consequently, any conscientious parent hasa 
legitimate interest in knowing information respecting his or her child’s sexual and psychological 
maturation, including but not limited to, the fact that the child is using a chest-binder, and/or is 
being identiﬁed by names or pronouns not associated with that child’s birth sex. 
26. After Plaintiff leamed of the chest binder(s) on December 2, 2022, Plaintiff also 
discovered that school ofﬁcials had been calling A.B. by a name not on her birth certiﬁcate and 
were referring to A.B. with gender-pronouns not typically associated with A.B.’s biological sex. 
Plaintiff had never been informed of these facts.
6
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 7 of 21 PagelD #:7 
27. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that failure to inform 
Plaintiff regarding the school’s use of certain pronouns when referring to A.B was the result of the 
Great Salt Bay School’s blanket policy, pattern, and practice of intentional withholding and 
concealment of such information from all parents. 
28. Speciﬁcally, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 
Defendants Roy and Berk chose, at A.B’s request, to use a different name and pronouns when 
speaking to or about A.B., and that other ofﬁcials at the school, including some teachers, did so 
afterwards. At no time, however, did any Defendant or any other school ofﬁcial inform Plaintiff 
of these facts. 
29. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants 
withheld and concealed this information from her pursuant to a blanket policy, pattem, and practice 
of withholding and concealing information respecting “gender-affirming ” treatment of minor 
children from their parents. 
30. Plaintiff has never given Defendants cause to believe that A.B. will be harmed in 
any way by Plaintiffs knowledge of such facts, nor is there any basis for such a belief. 
Consequently there is no rational basis for the Defendants ’ withholding and concealing such 
information. 
31. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants have 
no policy or procedure whereby Plaintiff can have input respecting Defendants ’ decision to 
implement a different name and pronouns respecting A.B., or providing A.B. with devices 
including, but not limited to, chest-binders.
7
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 8 of 21 PagelD #:8 
32. After discovering the chest binder on December 2, 2022, Plaintiff met with the 
Defendant Principal Schaff and Defendant Superintendent Johnston respectively. That meeting 
took place on or about December 5, 2022." 
33. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Schaff and Johnston expressed sympathy with 
Plaintiff, and concern that this infonnation had been withheld and concealed from her. 
34. On December 7, 2022, however, Defendant Johnston in a subsequent meeting with 
Plaintiff explained that no policy had been violated by the giving of chest binders to A.B., or by 
school ofﬁcials (speciﬁcally Defendants Roy and Berk) employing a different name and pronouns 
with respect to A.B., without informing Plaintiff. 
35. As a consequence of Defendants ’ policy, pattern, and practice of withholding and 
concealing of crucially important and intimate psychosexual information about her minor child, as 
alleged herein, Plaintiff decided to withdraw A.B. from the Great Salt Bay Community School on 
December 8, 2022, and began to homeschool A.B. 
36. Almost immediately afterwards, on December 12, 2022, Plaintiff was visited by 
agents of the Maine Ofﬁce of Child and Family Services. These agents informed Plaintiff that they 
had received an anonymous report that Plaintiff was emotionally abusive towards A.B. The 
investigation was completed on January 13, 2023, with a ﬁnding that the information obtained by 
the investigation did not support a ﬁnding of neglect or abuse. See Jan. 13, 2013 Letter attached 
as Exhibit 2. 
37. Plaintiff would have continued to send A.B. to the Great Salt Bay Community 
School but for the Defendants actions complained of herein.

Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 9 of 21 Page|D #19 
Public communications regarding the incident 
38. On December 14, 2022, Plaintiff spoke publicly about these incidents at the Great 
Salt Bay School Board Meeting. At that meeting, Plaintiff detailed the trust that had been broken 
by Defendants withholding and concealing vitally important information from her respecting her 
minor child’s psychosexual development and stated that the “decisions made [by the school] drove 
a Wedge between a child and her parents. ” 
39. Defendant School Board provided no response to Plaintiffs comments at the 
School Board meeting. Since then, however, Defendant School Board has released two separate 
statements regarding this incident, and Defendant Principal Schaff has also released a statement 
regarding this incident. 
40. In its ﬁrst statement, dated December 19, 2022, Defendant Great Salt Bay 
Community School Board asserted that all students at Great Salt Bay Community School——which 
serves kindergarten through eighth grade—have a “right to privacy regardless of age.” The 
Statement did not explain what justification exists for a blanket policy, pattern, and practice of 
concealing and withholding vital information about children from their parents. See Dec. 19, 2022 
Statement attached as Exhibit 3. 
41. In its second statement, dated January 14, 2023, Defendant Great Salt Bay 
Community School Board asserted that the school had received bomb threats in the preceding 
days. The statement asserted that the threats were caused by “certain parties .. . spreading a grossly 
inaccurate and one-sided story to which the Board cannot speciﬁcally respond, given our 
obligation to maintain the conﬁdentiality of student and employee information. ” See J an. 14, 2023 
Statement attached as Exhibit 4.
9
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 10 of 21 PagelD #: 10 
42. The Second Statement speciﬁcally asserted, with respect to the giving of a chest 
binder, the using of a new name and different pronouns, and without informing Plaintiff of these 
decisions, that “neither the Board nor school administration are aware of any violation of policy 
or law which requires ﬁnther action at this time.” Id. 
43. This is a post hoc ratiﬁcation of the actions of Defendants Roy, Berk, and Schaff 
by the Great Salt Bay Community School District Board. 
44. The Third Statement was issued by Defendant Schaff on February 26, 2023. See 
Feb. 26, 2023 Letter attached as Exhibit 5. 
45. The Third Statement alleged that “[a] misunderstanding of [state] laws pertaining 
to gender identity and privileged communication between school social workers and minor clients 
has resulted in the school and staff members becoming targets for hate speech and on-going 
threats. ” Id. 
46. Defendant Schaff also asserted that Defendants ’ actions with respect to Plaintiff 
and A.B. were governed by itle 20-A, § 4008, which provides that “[a] school counselor or school 
social worker may not be required, except as provided by this section, to divulge or release 
information gathered during a counseling relation with a client or with the parent, guardian ora 
person or agency having legal custody of a minor client.” Id. 
47. However, the Third Statement offered no explanation of how the giving of a chest 
compression device or the employment of alternate names and pronouns constitutes “information 
gathered. ” la’.
10
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page ll of 21 Page|D #1 11 
School Policies 
48. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants 
contend that their actions with respect to all allegations herein were mandated by school board 
policies —specif1cally the School Transgender Student Guidelines, adopted on March 13, 2019 
(“Transgender Guidelines ”), and the Policy regarding Staff and Student Conduct, adopted 
February 13, 2013 (“Conduct Policy”). See Transgender Guidelines attached as Exhibit 6 and 
Conduct Policy attached as Exhibit 7. 
49. Neither the Trans gender Policy nor the Conduct Policy nor any other legal authority 
justify the withholding of vital information about a minor child’s psychosexual development, 
including their asserted gender identity, from the child’s parents, absent some evidence of actual 
and substantial risk to the child. On the other hand, if they do, they are unconstitutional. 
50. The Trans gender Guidelines state that they are intended to: “1. To foster a learning 
environment that is safe, and free from discrimination, harassment and bullying; and 2. To assist 
in the educational and social integration of transgender students in our school!’ See Exhibit 6. 
51. The Transgender Guidelines are silent With respect to the giving of chest binders or 
any other devices to students with or without the knowledge or consent of the student’s parent(s). 
The Guidelines also do not mandate the involvement of parents at any point in the process of 
deciding whether to use alternate names and pronouns. 
52. The Conduct Policy is intended “to ensure that the interactions and relationships 
between staff members and students are based upon mutual respect and trust.” 
53. The Conduct Policy includes a non-exhaustive list of unacceptable conduct. One 
action explicitly prohibited under this policy is asking the student to keep a secret. See Exhibit 7.
ll
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 12 of 21 PagelD #1 12 
Injuries to Plaintiff 
54. Plaintiff has a fundamental constitutional right to control and direct the care, 
custody, education, upbringing, and healthcare decisions of her children. By withholding and 
concealing vital information about her minor child’s asserted gender identity —information any 
conscientious parent has a compelling interest in knowing—Defendants effectively rendered it 
impossible for Plaintiff to exercise that fundamental constitutional right. 
55. For example, by withholding and concealing information from Plaintiff, 
Defendants left Plaintiff without the ability to choose how to advise A.B. with respect to the risks 
and beneﬁts of wearing a chest binder, or the potential future consequences of employing an 
alternate name and pronouns. The Defendants ’ policy, pattern, and practice of concealment also 
left Plaintiff without the ability to seek additional or alternative educational, emotional, mental and 
physical health arrangements for A.B. 
56. Defendants ’ acts and omissions alleged herein forced Plaintiff to remove A.B. from 
Great Salt Bay Community School because she could no longer trust that she would be infonned 
of circumstances that are vitally important to the mental health and emotional and physical well- 
being of A.B. Plaintiff has also been forced not to send her children C.D. and E.F. to Great Salt 
Bay Community School as she had planned to do, because she cannot trust that school officials 
will be truthful toward her about their individual circumstances. 
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Allegations 
57. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Plaintiff and Defendants as to 
their respective legal rights and duties. Plaintiff contends, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that the 
Great Salt Bay Community School Transgender Student Guidance violates her parental rights by
12
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 13 of 21 PageID #: 13 
withholding and concealing information as alleged herein. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and 
on that basis alleges, that Defendants hold their actions to have been in all respects lawful. 
58. Accordingly, declaratory relief is appropriate. 
59. Due to Defendants ’ actions and policies, Plaintiff has been compelled to seek 
alternative education arrangements for A.B., C.D., and E.F. If not permanently enjoined by this 
Court, Defendants and their agents, representatives, and employees will continue to implement the 
policy, pattern, and practice of concealment alleged herein, which deprives Plaintiff of liberty 
without due process of law. Thus, the policy, pattem, and practice of concealment in which 
Defendants have engaged, are now engaged, and will continue toaengage, are now causing and will 
continue to cause Plaintiff to suffer irreparable injury, including but not limited to, the cost and 
burden of homeschooling her children. 
60. Plaintiff has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law for these injuries. 
6l. Accordingly, injunctive relief is appropriate. 
CAUSES OF ACTION 
Count1 
Substantive Due Process — Fourteenth Amendment 
62. Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs l-61 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 
63. One of the rights that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held to be a fundamental 
right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment (deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and 
tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty) is the right of parents to control and direct 
the education and general upbringing of their own child. See, e. g., T roxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 
57 (2000).
13
Case 2:23-cv-0O158~JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 14 of 21 PagelD #: 14 
64. The state may intercede in a parent-child relationship only when necessary to 
protect the health or safety of a child. 
65. The Great Salt Bay Community School Board’s ofﬁcial policy and Widespread 
custom of making decisions for students without informing or consulting with their parents 
established an enviromnent in which giving A.B. a chest binder and instructing A.B. on how to 
use a chest binder—without consulting Plaintiff, and afterwards withholding or concealing this 
information from Plaintiff —was not only allowed but considered standard practice for Defendant 
Roy. A 
66. By giving A.B. chest binders and instructing A.B. on how to use a chest binder— 
without consulting Plaintiff. and afterwards withholding or concealing this information from 
Plaintiff, Defendant Roy violated this right, causing such injuries as making it impossible for 
Plaintiff to advise A.B. with respect to the risks and beneﬁts of using such devices. 
67. By ratifying these decisions by Defendant Roy organizational Defendant Great Salt 
Bay Community School Board violated Plaintiffs parental rights for the same reason, causing the 
same injures. 
68. Defendants ’ actions alleged herein were undertaken pursuant to a blanket policy, 
pattem, practice, and custom and Defendants engaged in no process to determine whether any 
speciﬁc circumstances existed in A.B.’s case that might Warrant the withholding or concealment 
of information from Plaintiff. 
69.‘ Defendants ’ actions indicate a deliberate indifference to Plaintiff ’ s parental rights 
which shock the contemporary conscience because there is no sufficient govermnent interest that 
would justify Defendants ’ actions. ,
14
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 15 of 21 Page|D #: 15 
70. Defendant Great Salt Bay Community School Board showed a deliberate 
indifference towards Plaintiffs parental rights as the evidence and post hoc ratiﬁcation and 
rationalization make clear that Defendant ’s Roy, Berk, and Schaff were not properly trained on 
the relevance and requirements of parental rights with respect to giving of chest binders or other 
chest compression garments to students. 
71. There is no compelling, substantial, important, or even rational reason for the 
concealment of information alleged herein, nor was such concealment necessary to achieve, 
narrowly tailored to, reasonably related to, or rationally related to any compelling, substantial, or 
legitimate government interest. 
72. As a direct result of the Great Salt Bay Community School Board’s widespread 
custom of making decisions about students with respect to issues that directly affect the mental 
health or physical well-being of a child without parental notice or consent which led to Defendant 
Roy giving a chest binder to A.B., Plaintiff has suffered an immediate and direct injury for which 
she is entitled to compensation.i 
73. The Great Salt Bay Cormnunity School Board will continue to engage in violations 
of parental Fourteenth Amendment rights if it is not enjoined from continuing to enforce this policy 
and widespread custom. 
Count2 
Substantive Due Process — Fourteenth Amendment 
74. Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs 1-73 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 
75. The Great Salt Bay Community School Board’s widespread custom of making 
decisions for students, even decisions that implicate the students ’ mental health, physical Well-

being, and their psychosexual development without informing or consulting with their parents 
created an establishment and environment where Defendants Roy and Berk could began 
employing altemate names and pronouns for A.B. at school while Withholding or concealing that 
information from Plaintiff. 
76. The Great Salt Bay Community School Board’s Widespread custom of making 
decisions for students, even decisions that implicate the students ’ mental health, physical well- 
being, and their psychosexual development Without informing or consulting with their parents 
created an establishment and environment were Defendant Principal Schaff could allow staff of 
Great Salt Bay School to refer to A.B. by alternate names and pronouns while withholding or 
concealing that fact from Plaintiff. 
77. The actions of Defendants Schaff, Roy, and Berk were pursuant to a blanket policy, 
pattem, practice, and custom which withholds or conceals information from parents without regard 
to individual circumstances, and evidenced a deliberate indifference to Plaintiff ’ s parental rights 
which shocks the contemporary conscience because there is no sufficient government interest in 
this situation that justiﬁes their actions. 
78. There is no compelling, substantial, important, or even rational reason for 
Defendants Schafﬁ Roy, or Berk to withhold or conceal this information from Plaintiff, nor was 
such action necessary to achieve, narrowly tailored to, reasonably related to, or rationally related 
to any compelling, substantial, or legitimate government interest. 
79. Defendant Great Salt Bay Community School Board caused Plaintiffs 
constitutional injuries by failing to properly train school officials and staff about the meaning and 
relevance of parental rights in situations where a student asserts a gender identity different from
l6
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 17 of 21 PagelD #: 17 
their biological sex and asks to be known by a name and pronouns that match their gender identity. 
The failure to adequately train ofﬁcials about parental rights in the gender identity context after 
adopting the Great Salt Bay Community School Transgender Guidelines evinces a deliberate 
indifference towards the constitutional right of parents to control and direct the education, 
upbringing, and healthcare decisions of their children. 
80. By ratifying and continuing to implement the decisions of Defendants Schafﬁ Roy, 
and Berk, the organizational Defendants violated and are continuing to violate Plaintiffs parental 
rights for the same reasons. Defendant Great Salt Bay Community School Board will continue to 
engage in violations of parental Fourteenth Amendment rights if it is not enjoined from continuing 
to allow this policy and widespread custom.' 
81. As a direct result of the Great Salt Bay Community School Board’s official policy 
and widespread custom of making decisions about students with respect to issues that directly 
affect the mental health or physical well-being of a child Without parental notice or consent which 
led to Defendants Roy and Berk calling A.B. a different name and referring to her with pronouns 
not typically associated with her biological sex, Plaintiff has suffered an immediate and direct 
injury for which she is entitled to compensation.

82. Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs 1-81 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 
83. Defendants Great Salt Bay Community School and Great Salt Bay Community

officials to adopt procedures for the treatment of transgender students without consultation of, and

while withholding or concealing information from, parents, even absent evidence of risk to the 
child. 
84. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants 
contend that the Transgender Guidelines allowed Defendant Roy to give A.B. chest binders and 
instruct them on their use while withholding and concealing that information from Plaintiff and 
encouraging A.B. to withhold and conceal that information from Plaintiff. 
85. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants 
contend that the Transgender Guidelines allowed Defendants Roy and Berk to employ alternate 
names and pronouns to refer to A.B. while withholding or concealing that infonnation from 
Plaintiff. 
86. There is no compelling, substantial, important, or even rational reason for 
Defendant ’s policy, pattern, and practice of hiding from parents, vital information about a child’s 
psychosexual development, mental health, and emotional or physical well-being of their children, 
nor is this policy necessary to achieve, narrowly tailored to, reasonably related to, or rationally 
related to any compelling, substantial, or legitimate govemment interest. 
87. As a direct result of the Great Salt Bay Community School B0ard’s ofﬁcial policy 
of allowing school ofﬁcials to make decisions about students relating to their psychosexual 
development, including their gender identity, Plaintiff has suffered an immediate and direct injury 
for which she is entitled to compensation. 
88. The Great Salt Bay Community School Board will continue to violate parents’ 
longstanding Fourteenth Amendment rights if it is not enjoined from continuing to enforce its 
Trans gender Guidelines in the future.

Procedural Due Process — Fourteenth Amendment 
89. Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in 
paragraphs 1-88 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. 
90. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects against govemment 
action that impairs constitutional rights without adequate procedural safeguards. Procedural due 
process forbids the government from depriving Plaintiff of her constitutional rights except through 
some individualized process and requires the government to consider the signiﬁcance of her 
private interest, the risk that the government ’s procedures might erroneously deprive Plaintiff of 
that interest, the extent to which different procedures might reduce that risk, and the government ’s 
reason, if any, for employing alternative methods of protecting Plaintiffs rights. 
91. The policy, pattern, and practice of the Great Salt Bay Community School with 
respect to transgender students, or those students who wish to assert a gender identity different 
from their biological sex, includes no mechanism allowing a parent to participate in, or comment 
on, the sch0ol’s decision to provide that parent’s children with devices such as chest-binders, or to 
address his or her children by alternate names or pronouns. Instead, the Defendants follow an 
across-the-board, blanket policy, pattern, or practice that applies to all cases regardless of speciﬁc 
circumstances. 
92. Consequently, Plaintiff was deprived of any opportunity to be a part of the decision- 
making process for the speciﬁc actions that Defendants took with respect to A.B. 
93. The injury is the direct result of Defendant Great Salt Bay Community School 
Board’s failure to create a procedure through which Plaintiff could ensure the protection of her 
constitutional rights with respect to decisions made by school ofﬁcials in response to A.B.’s
19
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 20 of 21 PagelD #: 20 
psychosexual development, including her gender identity, and decisions that will directly affect 
the mental health or physical well-being of A.B. Plaintiff has suffered an immediate and direct 
injury ﬁom this lack of procedure and is entitled to compensation. 
94. As Plaintiff has additional children and has no plans to move in the near ﬁ1ll1I6, the 
lack of adequate procedural protections continues to harm Plaintiff, because attendance at school 
is mandatory under state law for any child over the age of 6 years old, and under Maine law the 
presumed school is a public school unless alternative arrangements are made and will continue to 
harm Plaintiff unless enjoined. Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A, § 5001-A. 
REQUESTS FOR RELIEF 
Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief: 
A. A declaratory judgment by the Court that Great Salt Bay Community School’s 
policy, pattern, and practice of withholding or concealing from parents, information about the 
child’s psychosexual development, including their asserted gender identity, absent some speciﬁc 
showing of risk to the child, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; 
B. An injunction preventing the school from calling Plaintiff ’ s children by a different 
name or pronouns without Plaintiffs express consent. 
C. An award of nominal damages in the amount of $1.00 for the violations of 
Plaintiff ’ s constitutional rights; 
D. An award of actual damages in the amount incurred by the Plaintiff as a result of 
removing A.B. from Great Salt Bay Community School; 
E. An award of attomey fees, costs, and expenses in this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1988; and'

Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1-5 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 1 of 1 Page|D #: 28 
Great Salt Bay Consolidated School District 
Bremen / Damariscotta / Newcastle 
February 26, 2023 
Dear Members of the GSB School Community, 
I know that many of you are seeking more information to better understand the events of the past three months and have 
questions pertaining to the safety of our school community. It is my sincere hope that in this letter I can provide some of 
the information sought after and more importantly, reassure our school community that GSB can continue to safely 
educate our children with the security measures we have put in place. 
To begin, one of the crucial pieces of information that needs to be highlighted is that school employees are required to 
follow the Federal and Maine laws pertaining to Civil and Human Rights. These laws provide speciﬁc protections against 
discrimination. For example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of I964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, 
and national origin, Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of disability, and Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. In 
addition to these Federal laws, Maine’s Civil Rights Act prohibits bias based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national 
origin, gender, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation. These laws provide rights to all individuals, including 
our students, that must be protected and upheld and these laws guide the actions of school employees. Another Maine law 
to highlight is Title 20-A, §4008. This educational law states that "a school counselor or school social worker may not be 
required, except as provided by this section, to divulge or release information gathered during a counseling relation witha 
client or with the parent, guardian or a person or agency having legal custody of a minor client." 
A misunderstanding of these laws pertaining to gender identity and privileged communication between school social 
workers and minor clients has resulted in the school and staff members becoming targets for hate speech and on-going 
threats. As noted in the Superintendent ’s letter on January l4th, “should these threats continue, our intention is to make 
necessary changes to our emergency and security plans.” With the continuation of these threats, the school has takena 
number of steps to increase security which has included hiring a security company to monitor the building, limiting access 
to the building during school hours and access to our back parking lot and bus loop during off~l1ours, reviewing protocols 
for lock-outs and other safety procedures, and increasing the presence of Damariscotta Police Department. Also with the 
continuation of these threats, the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State Law Enforcement 
Agencies has continued. Knowing the changes to our security plans and the involvement of law enforcement has given n1e 
greater conﬁdence in the safety of our building and school grounds. 
Since we can not predict if and when these threats will end, it is important for me to stress that the school and law 
enforcement will continue to take all threats seriously, and we will continue to communicate with members of the school 
community information about threats. If a threat is deemed not-credible and the decision is made to hold school, parents, 
guardians, and staff will be informed of the threat and parents/ guardians will be able to have their child’s absence excused 
if they are not comfortable with sending them to school. 
Given that three student days have been lost to these threats, the Superintendent will be seeking a waiver from the 
Governor to excuse these days from the mandatory 175 school days. In addition, she will be meeting with members of the 
PTO and school’s associations to solicit feedback on whether to have remote instruction if school needs to be canceled 
again due to threats and to listen to the concerns and needs of these groups. 
I truly hope the information I have shared has been informative and helpful. I am also hoping that if you have additional 
questions and/or concerns, you will reach out to me. 
Sincerely, 
Kim Schaff

Great Salt Bay Community School 
TRANSGENDER STUDENTS GUIDELINES 
A. Purpose 
The purposes of these guidelines are: 
1. To foster a learning environment that is safe, and free from discrimination, 
harassment and bullying; and~ 
2. To assist in the educational and social integration of transgender students 
in our school. 
These guidelines are intended to be interpreted in light of applicable federal and 
state laws and regulations, as well as Board policies, procedures and school 
rules.'
< 
These guidelines are not intended to anticipate every possible situation that may 
occur, since the needs of particular students and families differ depending on the 
student's age and other factors. In addition, the programs, facilities and 
resources of each school also differ. Administrators and school staff are 
expected to consider the needs of students on a case-by-case basis, and to 
utilize these guidelines and other available resources as appropriate. 
B. Definitions 
The following definitions are not intended to provide rigid labels for students, but 
to assist in discussing and addressing the needs of students. The terminology in 
this area is constantly evolving, and preferences for particular terminology vary 
widely. Administrators, school staff, volunteers, students and others who interact 
with students are expected to be sensitive to the ways in which particular 
transgender students may wish to be identified. However, for the sake of brevity,- 
these guidelines refer to “transgender students." 
1. Sexual orientation — Sexual orientation is defined in the Maine Human 
Rights Act as an individual ’s “actual or perceived heterosexuality, 
bisexuality, homosexuality or gender identity or expression. ” This is the 
only term related to these guidelines which is defined in Maine law. 
2. Gender identity — A person’s deeply held sense or psychological 
knowledge of their own gender. One’s gender identity can be the same or 
different than the gender assigned at birth. 
3. Gender expression — The manner in which a person represents or

GSB CSD Code: JB 
expresses gender to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, 
activities, voice or mannerisms. 
4. Transgender — An adjective describing a person whose gender identity or 
expression is different from that traditionally associated with an assigned 
sex at birth. 
5. Transition — The process by which a person goes from living and 
identifying as one gender to living and identifying as another. For most 
elementary and secondary students, this involves no or minimal medical 
inten/entions. ln most cases, transgender students under the age of 18 
are in a process of social transition from one gender to another. 
C. Addressing the Needs of Transgender Students 
For the purposes of these guidelines, a student will be considered transgender if, 
at school, helshe consistently asserts a gender identity or expression different 
from the gender assigned at birth. This involves more than a casual declaration 
of gender identity or expression, but it does not necessarily require a medical 
diagnosis.7 
The following procedure will be used to address needs raised by transgender 
students and/or their parent(s)/guardian(s). 
1. A transgender student and/or his/her parent(s)/guardian(s) should contact 
the building administrator or the student's guidance counselor. In the case 
of a student who has not yet enrolled in school, the appropriate building 
administrator should be contacted. 
2. A meeting should be scheduled to discuss the student's particular 
circumstances and needs. ln addition to the student, parent(s)/ 
guardian(s) and building administrator, other participants may include the 
guidance counselor or social worker, school nurse, teachers and/or other 
school staff, and possibly outside providers who can assist in developing a 
plan for that student. 
3. A plan should be developed by the school, in consultation with the 
student, parent(s)/guardian(s) and others as appropriate, to address the 
student's particular needs. lf the student has an lEP and/or a 504 Plan, 
the provisions of these plans should be taken into consideration in 
developing the plan for addressing transgender issues. 
4. The school may request documentation from medical providers or other 
Page 2 of5
Case 2:23-cv-00158-JDL Document 1-6 Filed O4/O4/23 Page 3 of 5 PagelD #: 31 
GSB CSD Code: JB 
sen/ice providers as necessary to assist staff in developing a plan 
appropriate for the student.- 
5. If the parties cannot reach an agreement about the elements to be 
included in the plan, the building administrator and/or Superintendent shall 
be consulted as appropriate. 
C. Guidance on Specific Issues 
1. Privacy: The student plan should address how to deal with disclosures 
that the student is transgender. ln some cases, a student may want 
school staff and students to know, and in other cases the student may not 
want this information to be widely known. School staff should take care to 
follow the student’s plan and not to inadvertently disclose information that 
is intended to be kept private-or that is protected from disclosure (such as 
confidential medical information). 
School staff should keep in mind that under FERPA, student records may 
only be accessed and disclosed to staff with a legitimate educational 
interest in the information. Disclosures to others should only be made with 
appropriate authorization from the administration and/or 
parents/guardians. 
2. Official Records: Schools are required to maintain a permanent record for. 
each student which includes legal name and gender. This information is 
also required for standardized tests and official school unit reports. This 
official information will only be changed upon receipt of documentation 
that a student’s name or gender has been changed in accordance with 
any applicable laws. Any requests to change a student’s legal name or 
gender in official records should be referred to the Superintendent. 
To the extent that the school is not required to use a student’s legal name 
or gender on school records or other documents, the school should use 
the name and gender identified in the student’s_plan. 
3. Names/Pronouns: A student who has been identified as transgender 
under these guidelines should be addressed by school staff and other 
students by the name and pronoun corresponding to their gender identity 
that is consistently asserted at school. 
4. Restrooms: A student who has been identified as transgender under these 
guidelines should be permitted to use the restrooms assigned to the 
gender which the student consistently asserts at school. A transgender

student who expresses a need for privacy will be provided with reasonable 
alternative facilities or accommodations such as using a separate stall ora 
staff facility. However, a student shall not be required to use a separate 
non-communal facility over his/her objection. 
Locker Rooms: As a general rule, transgender students will be permitted 
to use the locker room assigned to the gender which the student 
consistently asserts at school. A transgender student will not be required 
to use a locker room that conflicts with the gender identity consistently 
asserted at school. A transgender student who expresses a need for 
privacy will be provided with reasonable alternative facilities or 
accommodations, such as using a separate stall, a staff facility or separate 
schedule. 
Other Gender-Segregated Facilities or Activities: As a general rule, in any 
other facilities or activities when students may be separated by gender, 
transgender students may participate in accordance with the gender 
identity consistently asserted at school. Interscholastic athletic activities 
should be addressed through the Maine Principals Association 
Transgender Participation Policy. 
Dress Code: Transgender students may dress in accordance with their 
consistently asserted gender identity, consistent with any applicable 
requirements in the dress code or school rules. 
Safety and Support for Transgender and Transitioning Students: School 
staff are expected to comply with any plan developed for a transgender 
student and to notify the building administrator or other designated support 
person for the student if there are concerns about the plan, or about the 
student’s safety or welfare. 
School staff should be sensitive to the fact that transgender and 
transitioning students may be at higher risk for being bullied or harassed, 
and should immediately notify the appropriate administrator if he/she 
becomes aware of a problem. 
E. Staff Training and Informational Materials 
1. The Superintendent and/or building principal may institute in-service 
training and/or distribute educational materials about transgender issues 
to school staff as he/she deems appropriate. 
2. Teachers and other staff who have responsibilities for a transgender
