I am not sure why this is even a question.  I am a parent of 4 from the MSAD6 district
and very active with all 4 of my children including talking about real life and real 
situations more than I wish I have to.  I do not need the state or school system to 
intervene.  I am not for Chapter 117.  They are children and have parents for a reason.
You DO NOT have the right to take that away from me unless I do something terrible 
to them.  Until that time, I will parent my children and still have something to say 
about it.  You want respect from us than you need to give that same respect.  I 
understand that cannot speak for other parents and their ability however, I will always
stick up for my family and our rights.  Please do not let this pass.  It is a disgrace to 
many parents.  School is for EDUCATION not deciding what gender you think they 
should be and keeping that from the parents.  Absolutely appalling and cannot believe
I even have to fight for this right I should already have.
