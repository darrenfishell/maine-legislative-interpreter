LD 394 
Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Chapter 117: Rule Regarding the Duties of School Counselors 
and School Social Workers, a Major Substantive Rule of the Department of Education 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs: 
Greetings: I am writing in opposition to LD 395 above listed resolve.  Very simply it is designed to 
continue the separation of parent/child relationship.  By design we are having an uptick in student issues 
with parents and their children resulting from the school and government taking control over the lives of 
the children. 
Simply put the government has moved into an ownership relationship with the children.  They have 
determined that parents do not understand their children and rather than work with the parents keep 
vital information from the parents. 
This legislation will do nothing more than make the great divide between education institution and 
parent even greater. 
I urge you to vote ought not pass to LD 394. 
Thank You for your time
