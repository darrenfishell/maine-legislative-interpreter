I'll make this short and sweet....NO SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER, SCHOOL 
GUIDANCE COUSELOR, SCHOOL WORKER, TEACHER, SPECIAL NEEDS 
TEACHER, SCHOOL AID, ETC, ETC, NO ONE AT THE SCHOOL HAS ANY 
RIGHT TO ADVICE, CONSULT, CONSPIRE, OR TALK AGAINST A CHILD'S 
PARENTS WITHOUT TELLING THE PARENTS OF EVERYTHING 
DISCUSSED WITH THAT CHILD.  IT IS ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AND 
IN THE INTEREST OF THE PARENTS AND THE CHILD TO NOT INTERFERE 
WITH THE PARENT/CHILD RELATIONSHIP.  THE PARENT KNOWS THEIR 
CHILD THE BEST AND WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CHILD.  THIS IS NOTHING 
BUT A TECHNIQUE TO STEP BETWEEN THE CHILDREN AND THEIR 
PARENTS IN ORDER TO INDOCRINATE THEM INTO A SOCIALIST 
PHILOSOPHY OF STATE CONTROL OVER OUR CHILDREN.  THIS SHOULD 
NEVER PASS YOUR RESPONSIBLE DUE DILIGENCE!  THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR TIME.
