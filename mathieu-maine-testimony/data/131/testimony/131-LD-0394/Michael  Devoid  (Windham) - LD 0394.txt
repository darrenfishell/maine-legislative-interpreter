Parents know what is best for kids. If kids are held by age to get a life changing tattoo
or parent consent for piercings then they should not be physically or chemically alter 
their body's. I pretended to be a pirate as a kid I did not poke my eye out or cut me leg
off for a peg leg. This is the only mental disorder we allow and encourage people they
are correct. Do we talk with a anorexia or belemic person and say yes you are correct 
you are fat, you should stop eating? No we encourage them to get help. Accept their 
bodies for who they are. If over 18 they can get plastic surgery if they elect but not 
before. We need to help get services for mental help to accept their bodies for who 
they are. If that means they are a feminine guy, masculine guy, masculine female or 
feminine female or anything in-between that is who they are. They can make life 
decisions when they are over 18.
