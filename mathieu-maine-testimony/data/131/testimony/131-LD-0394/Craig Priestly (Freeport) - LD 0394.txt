I urge you to vote in opposition of this bill.
The role of a school social worker and school counselor is to work with the students 
parents to help the student  have a positive and safe experience in school and help 
them succeed with their education. 
Under the eyes of the law, a parents' first and most important responsibility is to keep 
their children safe. This means protecting their mental and physical health. In addition
to providing the basic physical needs of life, parents are also responsible for teaching 
children moral values, mutual respect and the difference between right and wrong. A 
child is not capable of making mature adult decisions on their own, it's why this 
dynamic and other age restrictive laws exists in the first place. We as parents are 
solely responsible for our children's proper and safe upbringing, not the government 
and certainly not a school social worker or school counselor.
This bill would drive a wedge between families and would not positively serve the 
child in the long run.
