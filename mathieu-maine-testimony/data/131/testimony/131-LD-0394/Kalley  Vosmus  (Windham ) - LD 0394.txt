My name is Kalley Vosmus. I am a Windham Maine resident. I have three children. 
I am writing you today to share that I would NOT like this bill to be passed. First and 
foremost, we are a religious Christian family with Christ at our center. 
I do not give anyone permission to groom, council, redirect, or “ help” my children in 
any way shape or form when it comes to their gender and sexuality preferences! With 
that being said I certainly do not give my permission for this to happen to my minor 
child WITHOUT my knowledge!
In order for my child to receive ibuprofen while I’m school, a permission slip needs to
be signed by either myself or her father. So I do NOT give my permission for 
ANYONE to give my child a medication, hormone, or vaccination without my 
consent! 
There is NOT ONE part of this bill that I agree with. It’s immoral, inhumane, and 
down right disgraceful.
