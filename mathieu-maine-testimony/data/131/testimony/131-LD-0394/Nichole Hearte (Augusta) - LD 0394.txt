I  vote NO on this bill.LD394 Chapter 117
As a member of the LGB community I know first hand how dangerous this is to all 
students and their families. Studies show that students that don't have parental 
involvement have higher suicidal rates. This is even more dangerous to students that 
identify from the LGBTQ community who already have higher suicidal rates, drug 
use and victimization. Parental involvement is 100% needed and counselors and 
psychiatrist need to find ways to involve parents so we can start lowering the 
devastating impact on all students. The Mental heath crisis needs more involvement 
and support by all children's parental supports in order to be effective with treating 
children. Allowing this to pass will cause more suicidal ideation amongst our 
students. So Please a big NO on Chapter 117
