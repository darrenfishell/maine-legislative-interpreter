Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the 
Education and Cultural affairs committee, my name is Heather 
Sprague I am a mother and grandmother from Cushing. I am 
speaking today in opposition to LD394. 
I oppose giving school counselors and social workers more 
power to make decisions regarding the healthcare and welfare of 
our children. Keeping those decisions secret from the parent or 
guardian would violate the parents constitutional rights. 
This would severely damage the sacred trust we have in our 
local schools. l wonder what will happen when parents start 
losing trust in our schools when they hear of secrets being kept 
from them. 
l kindly ask on behalf of my family and many others who have 
asked me to write this that you please vote ought not pass to 
protect our children and parents constitutional rights. 
Thank you for your time.
