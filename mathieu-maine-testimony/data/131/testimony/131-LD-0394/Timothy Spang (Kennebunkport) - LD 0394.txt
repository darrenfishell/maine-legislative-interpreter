Hi, my name is TimSpang, I’m against this because you’re taking the parents rights 
away you’re going to pin the student against the parents. The parents against the 
social worker and people with money are going to sue the districts, and people are 
gonna pull their kids out of these districts, And push for school choice. This should 
not pass. I’m a parent and a grandfather.
