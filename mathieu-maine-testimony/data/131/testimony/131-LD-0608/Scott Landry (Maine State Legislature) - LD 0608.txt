Testimony of Rep. Scott Landry presentingI 
LD 608, Resolve, to Improve Outcomes for Participants in the 
Antlerless Deer Permit Lottery 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
i 
Senator LaFountain and fellow members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlifd Committee, I am 
Representative Scott Landry. I serve House District 75, which includes the towns of Chesterville 
and F armington. Thank you for the opportunity to present LD 608, Res0lve,jto Improve 
» 
Outcomes for Participants in the Antlerless Deer Permit Lottery.
I 
This bill would improve upon the recent changes to the antlerless deer penniit lottery. As 
returning members of the committee will recall, the Legislature and the Department of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife made signiﬁcant changes to the antlerless deer permit! lottery system in 
2022. LD 608 is a small but important tweak to the new system. ii 
LD 608 provides that, if an applicant ’s name is drawn and their preferred wildlife management 
districts ’ permits have all been assigned, that applicant would be assigned toi| a WMD as 
geographically close as possible to their top choice. The eriception would beg if the applicant 
indicated they are not interested in any other WMDs. This change would be inodeled on the 
system we already use for the moose pemait lottery. .
i 
This simple bill would beneﬁt applicants for antlerless deer permits. Just as importantly, it would 
also support our white-tailed deer management goals. It’s a win-win for htmters and for our 
harvest targets. 
Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions.
