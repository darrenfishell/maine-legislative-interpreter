Testimony of the Ofﬁce of MaineCare Services 
Department of Health and Human Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
In Support of LD 4320 
/In Act to Clarijfv MaineCare Program Requirements Regarding Certain 
. High-risk Health Care Providers 
Presented by: Representative Madigan 
Hearing Date: March 17, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Bill Logan. I am the Director of Compliance for the 
Ofﬁce of MaineCare Services. I am here today to introduce and speak in support of LD 432, An 
Act to Clarify MaineCare Program Requirements Regarding Certain High-risk Health Care 
Providers. Thank you to Representative Madigan for sponsoring this Department bill. 
This Department bill was submitted to comply with federal requirements, 42 CFR 455.434. It 
clariﬁes the MaineCare program requirements regarding certain high~risk providers. It also 
requires a person with a certain level of ownership interest in a high-risk provider to submit toa 
ﬁngerprint-based criminal history record background check.R
. 
The Federal Bureau of Identiﬁcation has deniedthe State’s request for access to the FBI’s 
criminal background database necessary to comply with 42 CFR 455.434, as it is now requiring 
that the categories of persons subject to such a check be explicitly enumerated in statute. LD432 
will take the existing regulatory language in the MaineCare Beneﬁts Manual deﬁning who may 
be designated as “high-risk ” and place it into the statute. This language is consistent with federal 
regulations deﬁning high~risk providers. 
I will be happy to answer any questions you have and will plan to attend thework session.
