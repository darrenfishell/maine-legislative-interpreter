Re: Opposition to LD 850, An Act to Require State Agencies to Complete the Rulemaking Process 
Within One Year of a Legislative Directive to Adopt Rules  
 
 
Senator Nangle , Representative Stover,  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government , I am writing regarding  LD 850, An Act to Require State Agencies to Complete the 
Rulemaking Process Within One Year of a Legislative Directive to Adopt Rules . This bill would require 
agencies t hat are authorized to adopt rules to do so within 12 months of the effective date of the 
authorizing legislation.  
 
The Department opposes this bill because adopting rules within 12 months is not always feasible, or 
prudent. New legislati on covers a wide variety of issues , and the need for rules or the clarification  that 
would be required through rulemaking is unclear. A recent example of this is Maine’s Earned Paid Leave 
law, established in 2019 Public Law c .156. This legislation created a new program, and businesses and 
workers had many questions. To ensure that the rules that would be adopted provided the necessary 
clarifications , the Department conducted listening sessions across the state. Over the course of two 
months, ten listening s essions were held  from Springvale to Presque Isle. Subsequently, the Department 
synthesized the information received from attendees and drafted the rules. Following the required 
public comment period on the draft and the finalization of the rules, they were adopted in September 
2020 with an effective January 1, 2021. The authorizing legislation was enacted in May 2019. Had LD 850 
been in effect, the Department’s rules would have been nullified.  
 
In other circumstances, the need for rules is not imme diately apparent. In these circumstances, the 
Department would take a “wait and see” approach, rather than undertake rulemaking  simply because it 
is authorized to do so. A recent example of this is the Department’s rules relating to Registered 
Apprenticesh ips in the construction of energy generation facilities, authorized  in 2019 Public Law c .347.  
The Department  did not move directly into rulemaking because it was not immediately clear what the 
questions  were . Questions and concerns were gathered over time,  with initial rules being adopted at the 
end of 2021. This authorizing legislation  was enacted June 17, 2019 . Had LD 850 been in effect, the 
Department would have had to undertake meaningless rulemaking  or forfeited the right to adopt rules.  
 
 
 Further, it is unclear  how LD 850 would effect rulemaking that is already authorized, but not yet 
complete d.  
 
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 383.
