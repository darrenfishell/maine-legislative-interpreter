Government Committee:  
 
LD 850, An Act to Require State Agencies to Complete the Rulemaking Process Within One 
Year of a Legislative Directive to Adopt Rules , proposes that would require an agency to adopt 
or provisionally adopt rules within 12 months of a legislative directive.  
Major substantive rules require delivery to the Legislat ive Council by the second Friday in January 
in order to meet the legislative acceptance date. Given the complexity of the work required for a 
major substantive rule, this deadline is not always achievable within a single year from listing on 
the regulatory  agenda to delivery to the Council. For example, the D epartment of Education (DOE) 
completed a major substantive rule change with provisional adoption that began in 2021 as the 
result of chaptered law and is now awaiting  Legislative review. The work that began in 2021 
include d necessary conversations with educators, field experts, and our partners at Maineâ€™s 
educational organizations. The Maine Department of Education views rulemaking as a 
collaborative process and welcom es the expertise of our partners as we work toge ther to create 
meaningful rule changes that are aligned with current practice  and terminology , reflect  a modern 
understanding  of the needs of our students, and clarifies confusing language.   
   
The Maine Department of Education maintains a listing of 57 rules which includes nine rules with 
the State Board of Education. Of these, 18 are currently identified as major substantive. If LD 850 
is passed, the DOE would need to reexamine rulemaking prior ities, delay important updates to 
rules that guide our teachers and administrators in the field, and potentially require additional staf f 
and resources to ensure compliance with the new requirements.  
 
The Department will be available to provide additional  information on LD 850 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session.   
 
 
Sincerely , 
 
 
 
Daniel Chuhta  
Deputy Commissioner
