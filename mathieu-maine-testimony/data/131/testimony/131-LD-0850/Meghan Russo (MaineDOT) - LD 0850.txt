Testimony of Meghan Russo  
Maine Department of Transportation  
Before the 1 31st Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on State and Local 
Government  
 
In Opposition  
 
LD 850 
An Ac t to Require State Agencies to Complete  the Rulemaking Process Within One 
Year of a Legis lative Directive to Adopt Rules  
________________________________________________________________________  
 
Senator Nangle , Representative Stover , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State 
and Local Government , my name is Meg han Russo, and I am the Legislative Liaison for the 
Maine Department of Transportation. MaineDOT respectfully submits this testimony in 
opposition to LD 850, An Act to Require State Agencies to Complete the Rulemaking Process 
Within One Year of a Legislative Directive to Adopt Rules . 
 
The procedure of rulemaking is a deliberative process.  State a gencies, including MaineDOT, are 
required to  hold a public hearing on the rules be ing considered.  This includes publicly  posting 
notice of the hearing, allowing for public c omment, and responding to those comments.  
Requiring MaineDOT, along with other state agencies, to adopt all major substan tive rules 
within twelve months of the effectiveness date of the law that directs us to perform rulemaking 
could vi olate this due proce ss.   
 
Rulemaking  is in the administrative procedures act, one that requires  ample  time to ensure that 
the process is perf ormed correctly,  and the public has an opportunity to weigh in on the rule 
being considered . Imposing a  time-limit on this process could impede on this public process and 
have unintended consequences .   
 
It is for these reasons we request that you vote in opposition to LD 850.  Thank you.
