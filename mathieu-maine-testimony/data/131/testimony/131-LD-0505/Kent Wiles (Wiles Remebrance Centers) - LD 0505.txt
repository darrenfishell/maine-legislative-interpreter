Testimony in Support 
LD 505 — An Act to update the Reimbursement Rates for Transportation of Deceased 
Persons by Fimeral Homes» 
March 15, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health & Human 
Services Committee. My name is Kent Wiles. I live in Farmington and I have been a licensed 
Funeral Service Practitioner for30 years, serving the Western Wine Mountains Region from 
Dixfield to our West, Mercer to our east, Tumer to our south and Rangeley, Magalloway Plt., 
Eustis, and Cobum Gore to our north. 
As you can see by our geographic location, we serve the Maine Medical Examiner ’s ofﬁce as 
well as many local, county, and state agencies, sometimes in very remote locations. We also 
understand that we work with the Medical Examiner ’s office as a member of a team and we are 
honored to do that by providing the necessary transportation and assistance in a critical time of 
need. As we all know labor, fuel, vehicle, and insurance costs have all increased signiﬁcantly in 
the past several years. With this in mind, I support LD 505 and ask for your support, as it will 
help all of Maine Licensed Funeral Homes, recoup a larger portion of their expenses to provide 
this Lmique, yet necessary service to the State of Maine in conjunction with the Maine Medical 
Exan1iner ’s Ofﬁce. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, 
Respectfully, 
Kent C. Wiles
