March 15, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee. My name is Kandyce Powell, Executive Director of the 
Maine Hospice Council. I am pleased to be with you today to speak in support of LD 479, 
“An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the Membership of the Palliative Care and 
Quality of Life Interdisciplinary Advisory Council”. 
In 2015, the Maine Hospice Council worked in collaboration with ACS CAN to author LD 
479. Support came from many healthcare organizations and individuals who realized the 
high quality, cost-effective nature of providing an interdisciplinary approach to palliative 
care earlier upstream for a patient and family living with serious illness. However, they 
also realized many patients and families were not being offered the service. In addition, 
many institutions did not offer a comprehensive palliative care program, or any program 
at all. As well, healthcare professionals did not understand what palliative care was, nor 
the value it could offer patients and families. 
The Advisory Council presently has 13 voting members appointed for three-year terms. 
These appointees are selected by Legislative leadership, the Governor and the Maine 
Hospice Council. A fourteenth non-voting member is listed in statute as the “convening 
authority ” . The appointed members are experienced palliative care professionals 
representing various disciplines. The Advisory Council members convene approximately 
four times a year, with all meetings open to the public. Many guests have been invited 
over the past seven years, as well as interns and other interested parties. Their input has 
been invaluable. 
The Maine Hospice Council is a 501(c)3 non-proﬁt organization. All donations are tax-deductible.

However, when the legislation was written, we were remiss in not listing an ofﬁcial 
designation for one of the most important categories, that of the consumer of palliative 
care. Therefore, we are asking you to support an amendment to the original statute, 
which would designate a 15"‘ seat in recognition of the consumer. The appointing 
authority for an official “Consumer Seat” would be the made by the Governor of Maine. 
Thank you for considering our request! 
With my sincere respect and appreciation,
