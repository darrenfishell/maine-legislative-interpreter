Testimony in Support 
LD 505 - An Act to update the Reimbursement Rates for Transportation Of Deceased 
Persons by Funeral Homes 
March 14, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health & Human 
Services Committee. My name is Alissa Dodds and I live in the Greater Portland Area, I have 
been a Licensed Funeral Service Practitioner for seven years. 
I am in support of LD 505 - An Act to update the Reimbursement Rates for Transportation Of 
Deceased Persons by F\1l16l' ﬂl Homes. 
Throughout my work with families there are many questions that arise and one of them that 
come up recently pertains to the work We do assisting the Maine Medical EXaminer ’s Office. I 
have found there is conﬂicting information regarding what the medical examiner ’s office pays 
funeral home for the transportation the medical examiner ’s oﬂice requires. 
As an example, when someone passes at a home, the police contact the local funeral home to 
transport a person to the funeral home. Once the person reaches the funeral home the person is 
required to be moved to the Medical Examiner ’s Office in Augusta. Per the State website, which 
I have linked below, it states, “all autopsy expenses, including transport of the body to and from 
the OCME are bome by the state; there are no charges to the family.” 
Not only is there more than one transfer occurring, the financial amount given to funeral home 
do not adequately cover the cost of staff, gas, and a reasonable overhead for organizing both 
transfers.

Thank you for your time today 
Respectfully,
