24-Hour vs. Inde pendent Expenditure Reporting  
 
 24-Hour Reporting by PACs,  
Party Committees,  
Ballot Question Committees  Independent Expenditure  Reporting  
Purpose of 
Report  Larger transactions in the last 13 
days before an election should be 
disclosed  within 24 hours , rather 
than in the December post -election 
report  There is significant interest in d irect 
advocacy to voters by PACs and parties.  
Also, IE r eport s verif y there was no 
coordination by the candidates in the race.  
Transactions 
Covered  All contributions or expenditures 
above the monetary thresholds  must 
be disclosed ( except for regular 
staff payments and overhead ) Expenditures on communications 
advocating for or against candidates  
Monetary 
Threshold  $5,000 or more for contributi ons 
$1,000 or more for expenditures  Expenditures of more than $250 to 
advocate for or against a candidate  
Timing of 
Transactions  Last 13 days before an election  Anytime (but reports are due very quickly 
in the last 60 days before an election)  
 
 
Notes  
 
Typical IE communications are 
advertisements or direct mail.  
← If a PAC or party pays $1,000 or more for a communication expressly advocating for or against a candidate , 
only an IE report is required. The 24-Hour Report is waived under  a 
Commission  Rule .  Ch. 1, § 10(3)(D).

 Overall Commission View on LD 1811  
The proposal in LD 1811 is worth considering, but there are trade -offs. 
 
Rationale for Eliminating 24- Hour Expenditure Reporting by PACs and  Part ies 
• having two reporting requirements with similar deadlines can be  confus ing for some  
• focusing on communi cations  to voters (IEs)  could simplify the overall system  
• all information in 24 -Hour Reports will be reported in the 42- day post -election reports 
in December  (the information is not lost to the public ) 
• 24-Hour Reports are due  at busy time when party committees and PACs  would like to 
focus on campaigning and GOTV, not financial reporting to the S tate  
 
Downsides of Eliminating 24 -Hour Expenditure Report ing by PACs and  Part ies 
If 24 -Hour Reports for PAC and Party expenditures are eliminated, some payments above 
$1,000 for services will not be publicly reported  by PACs and party committees until 42 
days after the election  (see attachment), for example :  
• payments to consultants and contractors  
• transfers between PACs and part y committees between $1,000 and $5,000 
• campaign events  
• get out the vote  activities  
 
Increasing the $5,000 Contribution Threshold for 24- Hour Reporting b y PACs, 
Party Committees , and Ballot Question Committees  
Greater amounts of campaign funding are available to PACs, party committees, and ballot 
question committees compared to 10 or 20 years ago.  The Legislature may wish to 
consider increasing the thresh old for triggering a 24- Hour Report for large contributions  
from $5,000 to a larger amount, such as $10,000 or $20,000.  
   
 
LD 1811 -  Removal of 24- Hour Reports for PACs & Party Committees  
 
According to Commission staff research, there was $199,068.12 spent on campaign-
influencing expenditures in 2022 that was reported in 24- Hour Reports and not in 
Independent Expenditure Reports.  Therefore, none of this activity would have been 
reported to the public before the general election in November if 24- Hour Reports were 
not required.  
- $21,558.28 of donations from one PAC or party committee to another committee, 
that di d not reach the $5,000 reporting threshold for the recipient committee.  
 
- $134,164.54 in costs  of communications  to influence voters that did not meet the 
definition or $250 threshold of an independent expenditure. This included robo-texting, robo -calls, sl ate cards, GOTV efforts, social media ads, and more.  
 
- $33,500.00 in payments to consultants and contractors, and for professional 
services.  
 
- $9,845.30 in campaign events.
