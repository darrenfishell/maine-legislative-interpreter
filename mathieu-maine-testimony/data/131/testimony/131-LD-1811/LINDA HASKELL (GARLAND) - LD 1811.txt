LD 1811 - An Act to Clarify Required Political Committees 24-hour Reports
Madam chairperson Supica and committee. The change of the amount of the 
contribution should not change, the initial time of increase of contribution is every 2 
years, which has not been reached as of yet. It is a committee that reports, not a ballot 
question. This Ought not to Pass
