This is a terrible idea. It would annihilate these species. They are part of what makes 
our state special. And they have a right to live here. Clearly, sport hunters are using 
this issue to open hunting season to any time only for themselves. We need to address 
so many other important issues including poverty not to mention homelessness. But 
endless open season on wildlife is definitely not the answer.
