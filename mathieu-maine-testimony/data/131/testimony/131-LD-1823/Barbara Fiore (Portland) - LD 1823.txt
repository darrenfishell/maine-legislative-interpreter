LD 1823
Dear Committee Members,
The bill as written is unthoughtful, unacceptable, and inconsiderate of a 
systems-thinking view of our environment. Please OPPOSE L.D. 1823 because it 
threatens to undermine multiple Maine statutes that offer critical protections to our 
wildlife, our environment, and Maine landowners. We need to view ourselves as 
being part of the environment, not apart from it. LD 1823 also disrespects the 
authority of the legislature and agencies that created these statutes to assure these vital
protections. In fact, I think we need legislation that further protects wildlife FROM 
human impact. Consider the fact that bird strikes on buildings and houses is one of the
highest causes for bird mortality, particularly during migration. Allowing a 
free-for-all because of the ill-informed idea of food sovereignty will be devastating to 
our ecosystem. Please oppose LD 1823.
Kind regards,
Barbara A. Fiore
