 VOTE NO ON LD 183, “An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food”
The bill as written is unacceptable. I urge you to OPPOSE it because it threatens to 
undermine multiple Maine statutes that offer critical protections to our wildlife, our 
environment, and Maine landowners. It also disrespects the authority of the legislature
and agencies that created these statutes to assure these vital protections.
