LD 1823
To the ACF committee:
There is so much wrong with this bill that even to consider it is an affront to all of us 
who consider the state's rich natural environment and diverse array of wildlife our 
most treasured assets.
This isn't about food. This is a blatant manipulation of a serious issue (i.e., hunger) 
and sport hunters using that issue to gain unlimited access to kill our wildlife and 
make the woods unsafe all year long.
LD 1823 undermines critical protections for wild animals, the environment, and 
landowners. Furthermore, to statutorily equate the act of killing wildlife (for any 
reason) with gathering berries or harvesting a field of corn is patently absurd.
Reject special interests and protect our land and wildlife. You are all that stands 
between devastating what makes Maine so beautiful and the ruination of that beauty.
Thank you.
