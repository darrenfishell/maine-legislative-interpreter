Good Morn1ng Senator Ingwersen, Representat1ve Pluecker and d1st1nqu1shed members of the commlttee. My name is Betsy Garrdld, I live 1n Knox and I am Presldent of Food for Ma1ne's Future, a small but m1ghty non-prof1t organ1zat1on work1ng 1n the local food movement. I speak today 1n support of LD 1823 wh1ch I recommend be amended to 1nclude annual progress reports from the Department of Health and Human Serv1ces (DHHS) and the Department of Agr1culture, Conservatlon and Forestry (DACF) regard1ng lmplementatlon of both the Food Sovere1gnty Act and the R1ght to Food Const1tut1onal Amendment. 
I am go1ng to tell you a few th1ngs you already know, po1nt out some th1ngs you may not be aware of, and ask some quest1ons. Hop1ng to st1r thoughts regard1ng how th1ngs actually stand on the ground. 
In 2017 the Leg1s1ature passed 1nto law the Ma1ne Food Soverelgnty Act and 1n 2021 the people of Ma1ne voted to amend the1r const1tut1on to 1nclude the R1ght to Food. I want those two dates to st1ck 1n your m1nds as I show you two th1ngs. The f1rst 1s the front page of the DHHS "State of Ma1ne Food Code" not1ce the date: 2013. Th1s predates the passage of the Food Sovere1gnty Act and the R1ght to Food 
Amendment. The second 1s the PDF of the "Home Food L1cens1ng 101" fact sheet from the DAÂ£F. 
Ne1ther of these documents refer to the Food Sovere1gnty Act or the R1ght to Food Amendment. 0bv1ous1y the DHHS document predates these new laws and const1tut1ona1 r1ghts. why the DACF document does not ment1on them 1s d1ff1cult to ascerta1n. I do g1ve them cred1t for ment1on1ng the 1000 b1rd exemptlon statute that passed, I 
bel1eve, 1n 2010. 
Its been awh11e s1nce I sat 1n H1gh School C1v1cs but my understand1ng 1s that nota lot had changed 1n 50 years. Our government conslsts of three branches. Leg1s1at1ve, Execut1ve and Jud1c1al. when the Leg1slature enacts a statute 1t 1s the ]0b of the departments 1n the Execut1ve branch to wr1te rules and regulatlons and enforce them. It 1s not the1r ]Ob to dec1de wh1ch b1ts and p1eces they should regulate, or what rules they should enforce. 
One of the most v1tal ]ObS of the departments 1n the Execut1ve branch 1s to educate the pub11c about these rules and regulat1ons and how they w1ll be enforced. In th1s age of the 1nternet the webpages of these departments are the f1rst place c1t1zens go to understand what they need to be aware of 1n order to do such th1ngs as runa 
food bus1ness. when folks go to these webs1tes all of the current statues should be reflected there. On ne1ther the DHHS nor the DACF webs1te could I f1nd any ment1on of the Food Sover1gnty Act, passed 6 years ago, or the R1ght to Food Amendment, 
passed 2 years ago. I stopped count1ng the number of broken l1nks on these websltes 
because there were so many. 
So here are my two questlons, one 1s rhetor1cal and the other is Just a matter of cur1os1ty' why don't these portals for the educatlon of the c1t1zens correctly 
reflect the current statutes as enacted by the Leg1slature and the people of Ma1ne> 
And why are there two departments lnvolved 1n the 11cens1ng and 1nspect1on of food 
estab11shments 1n th1s state?

In closing I ask the committee to vote LD 1823 out "ought to pass" with the addition of the annual reporting requirement from both departments, ask that the committee review the information being promoted by these two departments regarding our local food systems, and thank the committee for their time. 
I W111 take any questions.
