DATE OF HEARING: May 10, Z023 
Good morning Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry Committee I am Jim Connolly, Resource Management Director speaking on 
behalf of the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, in opposition to L.D. 1823. 
This bill makes many changes to Titles 7, 12, 20-A and 30-A regarding food and food sovereignty 
There are three areas that impact Title 12 Part 13 and thus affecting the Department of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife The ﬁrst part of the bill that affects the Department IS the creation ofa 
definition of "Traditional Foodways" that includes "hunting, gathering, fishing, foraging, buying and 
selling of food” The bill then gives municipalities or plantations the right to adopt ordinances 
regarding traditional foodways and requires the State to recognize such ordinances The other two 
areas of concern include creating a definition for "harvest" in §10101 and changing the §10109 the 
statute that governs the acquisition and disposal of land to incorporate leasing as part of the 
considerations when disposing of land 
The major area of concern IS the creation of the concept of "Traditional Foodways" which includes 
hunting and fishing and then authorizing municipalities, plantations and for unorganized towns the 
County the authority to adopt ordinances regulating them Currently in Title 12 §13201 there are clear 
prohibitions on municipalities or political subdivisions ofthe State from enacting any ordinance, law, or 
rule regulating or charging a fee for the hunting, trapping, or fishing for any species of fish or wildlife, 
or the possession or use of any equipment expressly permitted for use in hunting under Title 12 This 
prohibition on municipal regulation of hunting, trapping and fishing IS repeated in Title 30-A §30075
Firearms and hunting equipment The Department feels that the authority that would be granted to 
municipalities in LD 1823 if passed as is, could be used by local communities to directly regulate 
hunting and fishing in their town ThlS‘COl'lﬂIC'CS with and is contrary to current State Law and the 
Legislatures previously codified intentions to have the ﬁsh and wildlife resources of the State managed 
centrally by the Department of lnland Fisheries and Wildlife for the beneﬁt of all the people of Maine 
and not fractured up into 913 plus entities each with their own potential ordinances 
Another section of LD 1823 creates in Title 12 §10001 sub-29A the definition for ”Harvest, the verb 
The verb Harvest means to gather, forage, catch, trap, hunt, ﬁsh, take, or kill for human consumption, 
sport, wildlife management or population control" The Legislature has already established definitions 
for hunting, trapping and fishing in Title 12 §10001 that would be affected by the new verb harvest 
that IS included in this bill The Department does not believe inserting this definition of harvest into 
Title 12 Part 13 IS necessary, ﬁnd it confusing since "harvest" is included in the definition of hunting, 
and believe it will likely have unintended consequences in the interpretation of existing sections of 
Title 12 where the word is already used in activities that don't relate to food 
The Department IS also concerned with leasing land being included as a directive in §10109 when 
disposing of unneeded property When the Department acquires land, it IS done with specific funding 
sources that spell out the precise steps for managing and the process to dispose of the land should it 
no longer serve the purposes for which it was acquired Leasing the land is not included as one of 
those alternatives and the Department is concerned the legislative directive to consider leasing to the 
extent practicable as potentially conflicting to grant agreements the Department has already 
committed to 
The Department oflnland Fisheries and Wildlife was established to preserve, protect, and enhance the 
inland fisheries and wildlife resources of the State, to encourage the wise use of these resources, to 
ensure coordinated planning for the future use and preservation of these resources, to provide for 
effective management of these resources, and to use regulated hunting, fishing and trapping as the 
basis for the management of these resources whenever feasible This mandate clearly establishes the 
importance of hunting, fishing, and trapping to the Department, its work managing the ﬁsh and wildlife 
resources and to thie people of the State of Maine The Department believes incorporating hunting, 
fishing, and trapping into a food sovereignty bill is problematic and will likely create lawsuits 
challenging the Department's authority to regulate these privileges in the State of Maine The clear 
direction to the Department contained in Title 12 §10051, the existing body of laws contained within 
Title 12 Part 13 on hunting, fishing, and trapping and the Legislature's own Standing Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife clearly provide the necessary protection and oversight to ensure hunting, 
fishing, and trapping continue For the above reasons the Department believes that hunting, fishing, 
and trapping should not be included in the bill as outlined above I would be glad to answer any 
questions at this time or during the work session
