LD 1823, An Act to Respect and Protect the Rzght to Food 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representat1ve Pluecker, and members of the Jomt Standmg Comm1ttee on 
Agrrculture, ConservatIon and Forestry, I am Cralg Lapme, DIrector of the Bureau of 
Agnculture, Food and Rural Resources m the Department of Agrrculture, Conservatron and 
Forestry I am here today to speak In Opposltron to LD 1823, “An Act to Respect and Protect the 
Rzght to Food” 
Current Law 
The Department supports Mame’s current Food Soverergnty Act (FSA) Under the FSA,a 
mm1IcIpa1Ity may adopt ordmances regardmg drrect producer-to-consumer transacuons where 
members of the publ1c may purchase goods produced on-s1te that are not sub] ect to state food 
laws Meat and poultry transactrons are exempted from the Act The Department beheves current 
law allows consumers to make Informed dec1s1ons to support local producers m food-soverelgn 
towns As of 2021, 113 MaIne towns had adopted local food soverergnty ordmances1 
Central to the current law 1S the requrrement that these transactrons mvolve a drrect producer-to- 
consumer mteractlon, deﬁned as “a face-to-face transact1on1nvolvIng food or food products at 
the srte of productlon of those food or food products ” In 2017, th1s Commlttee worked d1lIgently 
and mtentlonally to craft language to allow for the drrect producer-to-consumer sale of foods In 
commumtles adoptmg food soverelgnty ordInances We thInk that language establ1shes an 
appropnate sphere where consumers can reasonably be expected to have the pertment 
Informauon for themselves and theIr fam11Ies regard1ng any rrsks of foodbome Illness

Removal of Dlrect Producer-to-Consumer Requirement 
LD 1823 vastly expands that defmtlon of a d1rect producer-to-consumer transact1on As a result, 
anyone would be able to sell a food product anywhere a food sovere1gnty ordmance has been 
enacted as long as the exchange takes place “under mutually agreed-to terms” 
Ehmmatmg the d1rect producer-to-consumer requlrement could undermme the ab1l1ty of the 
consumer to make an mfonned dec1s1on regardmg the safety and qual1ty of the product whena 
purchase does not occur at the productlon s1te Furthermore, the new deﬁn1t1on of d1rect 
producer-to-consumer transactron could be broadly construed to allow the adopt1on of local 
ord1nances allow1ng food sales by mtemet, marl, or other means that don’trequ1re a face-to-face 
1nteract1on between the producer and consumer and wh1ch would slgmﬁcantly hnnt the ab1l1ty of 
DACF and other agenc1es to enforce food estabhshment l1cens1ng, 1nspect1on, and food safety 
requrrements 
State Regulatory Scheme 
The State’s food safety and processmg statutes, rules, and regulatrons have been developed over 
t1me to assure Ma1ne consumers of the safety of our food supply and that our farmers and food 
producers have the necessary processes and measures to protect the1r busrnesses from food-bome 
d1seases or adulterat1on We beheve that the over 7,000 local food bus1nesses currently llcensed 
and asslsted by the Department are a testament to the fact that we have a h1gh-qual1ty, busmess- 
fnendly, and safe food system where busmesses thnve and consumers feel conﬁdent when 
buymg Ma1ne-grown and processed food 
As a remlnder, no l1cense 1s requ1red to grow or sell produce Many other l1censes are relatrvely 
easy and affordable to acqulre The hcenses to sell m1lk and da1ry products, prepared foods, and 
prepared beverages are somet1mes cr1t1c1zed as burdensome In pract1ce, the Department 
regularly works one-on-one w1th appl1cants, offenng techn1cal assrstance, answenng questlons, 
and explalmng the fundamentals of food safety, san1tat1on, and fac1l1ty requrrements We a1m to 
prov1de educat1on and techn1cal assrstance to ensure the success and safety of every food 
bus1ness we work w1th — the value of th1s dlrect support far exceeds the cost of any hcense 
For mstance, a home processmg perm1t costs $20 amlually and requlres one 1mt1al 1nspect1on to 
assess water qual1ty, septlc capac1ty, and su1tab1l1ty of surfaces Should any of these not meet 
mlmmum standards, the Department works w1th the producer to ﬁnd the most cost-effectlve 
solut1ons After that, the Department may only have to re1nspect 1f we recelve a complamt 
Food Access & Consumer Confidence 
The Department does not regulate exchanges of food between fam1ly, nerghbors, or fnends Nor 
does the Department regulate gleaned food or food that char1table 1nd1v1duals and groups 
d1str1bute for free However, el1m1nat1ng exrstmg l1cens1ng requlrements for certa1n food 
producers (such as home kltchens or mob1le hcenses) does not necessanly make food more 
affordable, and 1t could decrease overall consumer conﬁdence 
Additlonal Issues to Note 
Sect1on 4 of the LD amends the DACF Comm1ss1oner ’s dut1es under 7 M R S A Sect1on 2 to 
add “Protect1ng and respect1ng, by not 1nterfenng w1th, the r1ght to food as declared 1n the 
Const1tut1on of Mame, Art1cle I, S6ClI1OI1 25 ” We are concerned th1s could conﬂ1ct w1th the 
C0mm1ss1oner ’s duty to enforce other laws for whrch she 1s I'6Sp0I1S1bl6

We are not opposed to the sect1ons amendlng T1tle 12 to perm1t leasmg land for agncultural uses 
except to note that they are redundant T1tle 12 already allows the Department to lease state park 
land and certa1n publ1c lands for ‘commerclal purposes, ’ wh1ch mclude agnculture, lndeed, we 
have several such leases 
We are not opposed to cons1der1ng vers1ons of the land lease sect1ons and the Land for Mame’s 
Future sect1ons that create preferences for some hlstoncally marg1nal1zed commun1t1es 
We note that hemp 1s consrdered food under current law The b1ll estabhshes the Mame 
Vegetable Garden Protect1on Act, and 1ts prov1s1ons might lmpede the State’s ablhty to llcense 
or regulate hemp 
We ﬂag that the deﬁmtlon of “trad1t1onal foodways ” may nnpede the enforcement of huntmg and 
ﬁshmg laws and l1cens1ng requ1rements On th1s po1nt, we y1eld to agencles w1th greater 
expert1se and mvolvement 1n these 1SSl.16S 
Thank you for your t1me I would be happy to answer your questlons I and other staff can also 
be avallable to answer quest1ons durmg the work sesslon
