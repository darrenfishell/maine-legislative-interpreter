Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 1823 
May 10, 2023 
 
My name is John M. Glowa, Sr.  I am a resident of South China. 
L.D. 1823 is nothing less than political payback to the radical extremists at the Sportsman’s Alliance of 
Maine for their support of the constitutional amendment.  Making hunting and trapping constitutional 
rights instead of privileges has been a national movement for years.  SAM has been engaged in this 
effort for years. 
This bill is nothing but a backdoor attempt to make hunting and trapping constitutional rights.  Past 
overt efforts to make hunting and trapping constitutional rights failed when they were considered by 
the appropriate committee.  This is nothing less than an end run.  Like the horrible constitutional 
amendment which supporters claimed had nothing to do with hunting, this bill will even further open a 
can of worms that one can’t even imagine. 
Hunting should remain a privilege.  Trapping should be banned.  This bill should be defeated.
