LD 1823 - An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food
This proposal would give towns the ability to over ride State regulations when they 
apply to anything farming OR hunting.
For example, a town could pass a hunting ordinance that allowed hunting on any 
property within town boundaries, it could allow hunting on Sunday, or even hunting 
deer with dogs.
It could allow destruction of environmentally sensitive areas.
It could eliminate the requirement for health inspections of food providers. 
Allowing the leasing of PUBLIC LANDS to "livestock grazing"? I will give you an 
example of that disaster: A bison farm in central Maine that had 100+ acres under 
fence and the bison stripped the bark off the trees and killed them.
What about the importance of the under story? Gone with "livestock grazing".
The absolute damage caused by this practice out West to our public lands is a 
travesty. It has destroyed sensitive ecosystems.It has led to enormous cost to the 
taxpayer under "wildlife services" which drops poison to kill wildlife for the benefit 
of livestock.
Nothing in this proposal is good for Maine-and in fact, the Right to Food amendment 
should be reviewed and terminated.Please oppose
