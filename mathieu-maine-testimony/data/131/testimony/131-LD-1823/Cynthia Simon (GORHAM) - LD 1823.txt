LD 1823
PLEASE, vote NO-NO-NO on LD 1823, “An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to 
Food”. 
Opposing L.D. 1823 is critical because it disregards and voids many other respectable
Maine traditions and rights. 
- It voids the silent Sunday tradition of SAFELY hiking and recreating in Maine 
public lands without the constant threat of gunfire that I often encounter on the other 
six days per week. 
- It disregards critical protections to our dwindling wildlife imperitive to healthy, 
balanced ecosystems. Maine wildlife is NOT made up of bear, deer and moose, but a 
wide array of diverse animals that need to live in sync. 
- It disrespects landowners who already deal with much trespassing unless there are 
tons and tons of signs on private property. 
- It fails to address poaching.
- Importantly, it disrespects the authority of the legislature and agencies that created 
these statutes to assure these vital protections. 
- It fails to address Maine's future in the face of climate change and the need to be 
flexible to our changing climate and resultant continuation and exasperation of 
ecosystem disease. Invasives and disease are growing threats to Maine's wildlife and 
this is counter to solving this and related issues. 
- The special interest of this bill is glaring. Already Maine has shameful, unethical 
and embarrassing coyote hunting practices, bear baiting, beaver trapping, and lead 
fishing that are archaic, toxic and unscientific. 
- Maine must use peer-reviewed science, not hunting lobbies, as justification for 
Maine hunting practices, as the only way to move forward in our cherished ecosystem
health and viablity.
