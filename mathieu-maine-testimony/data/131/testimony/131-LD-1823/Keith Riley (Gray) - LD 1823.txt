LD 1823
Dear Members of the Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to LD 1823, "An Act to Respect and 
Protect the Right to Food." As written, this bill has the potential to undermine critical 
protections for Maine's wildlife, environment, and landowner rights.
While the bill may appear worthy on the surface, there are several concerning 
provisions buried within its 10 pages. Specifically, LD 1823 could:
Strip away a wide array of Maine statutes that protect wildlife, landowners, and the 
environment.
Prohibit the enforcement of Maine's wildlife, marine life, animal welfare, and 
environmental protection statutes that might interfere with "traditional foodways" 
(e.g., hunting, trapping, fishing, gathering & foraging) if towns and counties pass 
ordinances to protect such "foodways."
Legalize activities such as Sunday-hunting and open trade in bear bile with the state 
powerless to stop it.
Designate wild animals as objects to be owned and used because of the way "harvest" 
is defined in the bill.
The implications of the language in LD 1823 are far-reaching and dangerous for 
Maine's wildlife and environment. As a concerned citizen, I urge you to vote NO on 
LD 1823 and oppose this bill in its current form.
I appreciate your attention to this matter and your dedication to protecting Maine's 
wildlife, environment, and landowner rights. Thank you for your service to our state.
Sincerely,
Keith Riley
