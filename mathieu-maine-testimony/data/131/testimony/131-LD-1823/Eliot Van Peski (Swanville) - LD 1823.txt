Eliot Van Peski
Swanville
LD 1823
My name is Eliot Van Peski and I am a resident of Swanville, Maine. I am asking for 
your vote in favor of LD 1823, An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food. This 
bill has many different positive elements but what I would like to emphasize today is 
the importance of increasing legal protections on local food commerce. I am 24 years 
old and have chosen a career in small-scale farming. I see every day the harms done 
by our current system of food commerce regulation, which was designed mostly for 
medium-to-large-scale business, and I believe furthering the principles of food 
sovereignty will foster greater strength and resilience in all our communities, most 
especially rural ones.
In 2021, the voters of Maine amended our state constitution to explicitly protect our 
right to acquire (by any means, including purchase) the food of our choosing. At some
point, we will have to acknowledge in law that prohibiting a person from selling food 
to their neighbors often makes that food unavailable and therefore infringes upon 
those neighbors’ right to acquire it. LD 1823 may not go all the way in this regard but 
it is a step in the right direction.
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 1823. Thank you for listening, and have a great 
day. -Eliot
