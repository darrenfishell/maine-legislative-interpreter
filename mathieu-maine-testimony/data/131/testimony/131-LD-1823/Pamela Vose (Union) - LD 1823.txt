LD 1823
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident and landowner in Union, Maine.   
I urge you to vote against  LD 1823 - An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food
I oppose the bill as written because it threatens to undermine multiple Maine statutes 
that offer critical protections to our wildlife, our environment, and Maine landowners.
As a landowner, I have seen the steady push to allow more time when hunters can be 
on unposted land.  This often goes against the wishes of those of us who purchased 
and use our property for other uses and cannot do so safely with people able to use the
guise of "hunger" to hunt any time at all.   Hunger is a real problem that needs to be 
seriously addressed separately and resolved and funded appropriately.  This 
pseudoâ€“Sunday Hunting bill is not the solution.  
Allowing anyone to access to"forage" (aka steal) food sources from unposted private 
property not only takes these food sources away from the rightful owner, it also opens
property owners up to liability issues should someone get injured or killed while on 
their property.  If you want to ensure that there is a massive change from previously 
unposted private property to posted private property this is the way to do it.   
Next, think about the resources necessary to resolve the trespassing and theft issues 
that will result from the mindset that anyone now has "permission" to take what they 
want from any property they want at any time.  I hope your legislative checkbook is 
open.
I strongly urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on this misguided Pandora's Box of a 
bill.
