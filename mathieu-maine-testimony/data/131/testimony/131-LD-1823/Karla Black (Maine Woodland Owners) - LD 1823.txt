Testrmony of Karla Black 
Deputy Executrve Drrector 
Marne Woodland Owners 
1n Opposrtron to 
LD 1823 
"An Act to Respect and Protect the Rrght to Food" 
Senator Ingwersen, Representatrve Pluecker and drstrngurshed members of the Jornt 
Standrng Commrttee on Agrrculture, Conservatron and Forestry, my name 1s Karla 
Black, I am the Deputy Executrve Drrector of Marne Woodland Owners speakrng 
today 1n Opposrtron to LD 1823, "An Act to Respect and Protect the R1ght to Food" 
We oppose the brll because we are concerned about rts unrntended consequences as 1t 
relates to landowner property r1 ghts and the regulatron of wrldlrfe resources 
Marne Woodland Owners 1s a non-proﬁt educatronal orgamzatron that promotes 
stewardshrp of Ma1ne’s small woodland resources through the encouragement of good 
forest management and advocatrng for and supportmg Ma1ne’s small woodland 
owners 
As you know, the crtrzens of Marne passed the “R1ght to Food” constrtutronal 
amendment 1n November of 2021 Desprte testrmony that the amendment would not 
rmpact any huntrng laws 1n Marne, the ﬁrst challenge to the amendment 1s a lawsurt 
clarmrng the amendment supersedes the Commlssroner of Inland Frsherres and 
W1ldl1fe ’s authorrty to enforce the Sunday huntrng ban that has exrsted 1n Marne 
statute srnce 1883 Whrle 1t rs hard to rmagrne that anyone who voted for the R1ght to 
Food amendment thought 1t would overturn the Sunday huntrng ban, that lawsurt 1s 
currently pendrng on appeal before the Mame Law Court 
In th1s b1l1 a deﬁnrtron of“trad1t1onal foodways ” 1s enacted 1n Sectlon 6 and the 
deﬁmtron rncludes huntrng The b1ll goes on 1n Sectron 12 to provrde that 
munrcrpalrtres may adopt ordrnances regardrng tradrtlonal foodways (huntrng), rt also 
states 1n Sectron 13 that the state may not “take an enforcement actron of any krnd 
agarnst or rnterfere 1n any way wrth any act1v1t1es authorrzed pursuant to a local food 
ord1nance[ ]” Under these provrsrons could a mumcrpalrty enact a local ordrnance that 
permrts Sunday huntrng (agarnst the W111 of the Marne people and of thrs legrslature 
whrch has re] ected Sunday huntrng brlls for decades)? Is thrs provlsron rntended to 
allow for local regulatron of hunt1ng‘7 If not, why 1s huntrng rncluded 1n the deﬁmtron 
A Nonproﬁt Corporatron - IRC 501(c)(3)
of trad1t1onal foodways? Sect1on 15 of the b1l1 prov1des that any ord1nance regard1ng trad1t1onal 
foodways must be lrberally construed 
What about Tltle 12 sectlon 13201 wh1ch prov1des that “a mun1c1pal1ty or pol1t1cal subd1v1s10n of 
the State may not enact any ordrnance, law or rule regulatrng or chargmg a fee for the huntmg, 
trapplng or ﬁshing for any specles of ﬁsh or w1ld11fe[ ]” Does th1s b1ll say that sectlon 13201 
would no longer be enforceable agamst a mun1c1pal1ty that enacts a local food ord1nance that 
regulates huntrng, trapplng or ﬁslnng‘7 It 1s unclear 
The b1l1 also mcludes new deﬁn1t1ons of the word “harvest” that are rncluded 1n the 1nland 
ﬁshenes and wrldhfe and marlne resources statutes What 1s the 1ntent1on behrnd addmg the verb 
“harvest” to these sectlons of statutes ‘? Whrle the Department of Inland Frshenes and W1ldl1fe 
regulates huntrng, 1t does not regulate gathenng and foragmg wh1ch are 1nc1uded 1n the 
deﬁmtlon It 1s uncertam how these two terms as commonly used relate to the work of Inland 
Frshenes and W1ldl1fe or Manne Resources 
The terms forag1ng and gathenng are also mcluded 1n the deﬁn1t1on of trad1t1onal foodways It 1s 
d1fﬁcult to envis1on how these terms m1ght be used by a mun1c1pal1ty 1n a local food ordmance 
Landowners have the 1mpl1c1t r1 ght to forage and gather on therr own lands But aren’t these 
terms typrcally assoc1ated w1th conduct1ng act1v1ty on someone else’s property ‘? Coulda 
mun1c1pal ord1nance grant 1nd1v1duals new nghts to forage or gather wherever they choose, 
1nclud1ng on someone else’s property ‘? Foragmg or gathenng on someone else’s property 
w1thout perm1ss1on 1s theﬁ 
W'h1le we apprec1ate the rntent of the b1ll 1s to make 1t eas1er to provrde more local food to 
Ma1ne’s c1t1zens, Ma1ne Woodland Owners 1s concemed about the far-reachrng 1mp11cat1ons th1s 
b1ll w1ll have It could create a patchwork of local huntlng and ﬁsh1ng regulat1ons that would 
potentrally conﬂ1ctw1th state regulat1on of those resources and put 1nd1v1dua1 property nghts at 
nsk 
For these reasons, Mame Woodland Owners opposes LD 1823 and encourages the Commrttee to 
vote Ought Not to Pass
