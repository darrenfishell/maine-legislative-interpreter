Good Shepherd Food Bank of Maine testimony to the Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
in support of LD 1832 – An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food  
To Chairperson Ingwersen, Chairperson Pluecker and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry: 
My name is Rebekah Lane and I am the Community Organizer for Good Shepherd Food Bank of Maine. I am 
here today to express our support, and ask for your support, of LD 1832 – An Act to Respect and Protect the 
Right to Food  
The mission of Good Shepherd Food Bank is to eliminate hunger in Maine by improving access to nutritious 
food for people in need, building strong community partnerships, and mobilizing the public in the fight to end 
hunger. Good Shepherd Food Bank works in partnership with nearly 600 organizations to help distribute food 
to community members in need. Our network of partner agencies includes food pantries, meal sites, senior 
centers, school programs, and healthcare facilities. In our work centering equity, we are increasingly working 
with communities of color to address food security in a culturally responsive way.  
We believe there is a solution to the problem of hunger in Maine. Working in partnership with the state 
legislature we can and will help reduce the impact of hunger in our state and make Maine a stronger, better 
place to work and live.  
The right to grown ones own food, the access to learn how to do so, as well as increasing edibile landscaping, 
food forests, and community gardens can go a long way in fighting hunger.  Good Shepherd Food Bank of 
Maine is in support of the right to food and ask that you vote in support of LD 1832.  
Thank you for your consideration of our testimony. 
Sincerely, 
Rebekah Lane
