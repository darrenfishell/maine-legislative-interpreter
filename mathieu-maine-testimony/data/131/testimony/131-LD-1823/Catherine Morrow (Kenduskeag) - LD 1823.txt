LD 1823 “An Act to Protect and Respect the Right to Food" 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, 
My name is Catherine Morrow I live on an old farm in Kenduskeag, Maine I ama 
homesteadmg, homeschooling mother of three, as well as a slow food educator, and community 
leader 
I am here today to testify in favor of LD 1823 
O I deeply feel that our communities deserve to have these fortified rights - Many of the 
proposed clarifications would absolutely, truly help to protect our small businesses and 
farmsteads that operate under local food sovereignty ordinancesl 
0 I also feel that it is especially important to include the food sovereignty principles There 
is a genuine lack of understanding, especially from lawyers, who can see things only 
from very specific lenses 
From my town's experience, the state enforcement agents, and lawyers involved are utterly and 
totally confused They say the MFSA’s “intent is unclear” 
DHHS has already harassed, and shut down one of our businesses operating under a LFSO- 
This business was not only providing a service to our community that we were lacking, they also 
supported the greater network of farmers, homesteaders and community members in our 
region 
I truly believe that future generations deserve to have unadulterated, guaranteed access to the 
wholesome , nourishing foods they choose for themselves and their families Please vote ought 
to passl 
Slow Food International envisions a world in which all people can access and enjoy food that IS 
good for them, good for those who grow it and good for the planet The purpose of the “slow 
food movement ” is to defend regional traditions, good food, gastronomic pleasure and a slower 
pace of life 
“lt‘s imperative that we codify guaranteed rights to grow and access nutritious and culturally 
relevant food in every state and territory across the US This is a clear path toward embracing 
food sovereignty, decolonizing our diets, increasing food access and nutritional security, and 
moving our nation one step closer to good, clean and fair food for all" - SLOW FOOD USA
