Ma;i.ne Cheese Gulld Testlmony on LD1823 (May 10,2023) 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, members of the Joint Legislative Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and members of the public, thank you for the 
opportunity to speak to this proposed legislation My name is Jean Koons, I am a cheese 
maker in Sidney, and I am the current President of the Maine Cheese Guild On behalf of the 
Guild, I testify Against LD1823 An Act To Protect and Respect the Right to Food This extreme 
bill does not, in fact, protect and respect the right to food, but it proposes to greatly broaden 
the ability of unregulated food processors to sell their products in Maine and beyond 
I Wlll begin with the Guild's Quality Statement — published in 2009 — which is a fundamental AENIE

The Maine Cheese Guild believes that cheese of the highest quality can only be made with a thorough and regularly refreshed knowledge 
of food safety 
The Maine Cheese Guild promotes and sponsors regular opportunities to Ieam about best practices for cheese making The Guild also 
believes that the best way for professional cheese makers to guarantee the quality of their product is by being appropriately licensed by 
the Maine Department of Agriculture, as only licensed cheese makers are legally allowed to sell cheese to the wider public, and only 
licensed cheese makers receive feedback from the dairy regulatory unit through regular testing for contamination and facility inspections 
This feedback is critical, together with on-going education, in maintaining the high quality ofaward-winning Maine cheese 
Those who would argue that state licensing and regulation are ‘impossible ’ standards for a struggling farmer or dairy 
processor to meet are ignoring the vast number of small farms and dairy processors who have been licensed in the past 
15 years Those who would argue that it's too expensive to meet current regulatory standards have probably never 
called a dairy inspector to ask for help planning an affordable, sensible, and sanitary milking parlors and processing 
room In our long experience Maine's dairy inspectors and milk lab have always worked to help small dairy processors 
succeed in becoming and remaining licensed, and to succeed in becoming successful sustainable businesses All of these 
valuable resources are available from the State at the cost of the minimum $35 annual licensing fee A single private lab 
product test for coliform costs more than $35 today, and the State provides at least ten tests a year for licensed dairy 
processors at no additional cost The state also tests every non—municipal water supply annually for licensed processors 
Instead, LD1823 threatens many small farmers who have gained the trust of their local community We are concerned 
that this bill threatens the whole local food movement that has slowly grown in this state over the last 50 years with the 
help of MOFGA, the Guild, and other support groups, as well as the success of many new farmers markets over the last 
20 years. The changes proposed by this legislation further distance the "Know Your Farmer" stance that the supporters 
have always argued was so important If this legislation is passed the customer will no longer need to visit the farm or 
learn anything about a farmers‘ skills, the farm's connection to their community, or the sustainability of the operation 
Unregulated food producers cannot be insured, shifting all risk to the consumer, and LD1823 provides no legal 
requirement to disclose to the public that their food is produced in unlicensed and uninspected facilities Without such 
labeling the consumer is not given choice, but rather is given the entire responsibility for researching the licensed status 
of any food producer for any Maine food item found on store shelves or on the internet Further, explicitly removing the 
authority of DACF from implementing food quality and food safety programs threatens not only the food system, but 
also unsuspecting consumers across the state 
In our opinion this extreme bill IS an ambitious attempt to further deregulate Maine's food system that was working 
extremely well for small farmers before this kind of legislation was ever considered The Maine Cheese Guild urges this 
committee to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD1823
