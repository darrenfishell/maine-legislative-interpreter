Discover Maine Food, LLC
LD 1823
I have worked to promote Maine farms, farmers' markets and food businesses since 
2013. Part of my work has been to help grow customer bases at Farmers' Markets. 
Part of building a strong customer base has been reassuring customers that farmer's 
market food is safe. 
I have served on farmers' market boards and also helped them to grow their customer 
base. The farmers' markets I have worked with have required applicable licenses and 
inspections, as required by state law. Those requirements have been a selling point for
customers especially for Maine made cheeses. 
My concern is with the change in definition of site of production in LD1823- "Direct 
producer-to-consumer transaction" by removing "SITE OF PRODUCTION". Our 
work in the farmers' market community has helped to build trust with customers. We 
have worked hard to make our customers feel comfortable that a farmersâ€™ market is a 
place where they can shop safely. To our credit we have attracted customers who once
only shopped at boxed stores. This work has been going on for decades and if one 
person gets sick from food borne illness it will undermine the work of those licensed 
cheese makers. The risk for the community is too high. 
Site of production is an important distinction. Please consider keeping the site of 
production as the actual site where the product is made to show support for the work 
we have all done to promote local food in Maine. 
Thank you,
