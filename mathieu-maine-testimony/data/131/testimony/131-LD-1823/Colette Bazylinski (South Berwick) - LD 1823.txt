LD 1823
I am writing to express my opposition to LD 1823, An Act to Respect and Protect the 
Right to Food. I’m unclear about what sections of this bill are supposed to actually 
achieve (e.g. why is there a section affirming that people have the right to cultivate 
vegetable gardens on their own property…are personal vegetable gardens on one’s 
own property outlawed somewhere in the state?) and very concerned about the effect 
other sections would have. The section on “traditional foodways” is particularly 
disturbing because of the definition used in the bill: “’Traditional foodways’ 
includes…hunting, gathering, fishing…[and] uses of food products other than for 
eating.” The fact that “hunting” and “uses of food products other than for eating” 
(“food products” includes meat, poultry, and fish…aka animals) are included in 
“traditional foodways” could allow animal welfare and hunting laws to be challenged 
or outright ignored if people have a right to food sovereignty. The law banning 
Sunday hunting could be challenged (even more than it already is by the hunting/gun 
lobby). Environmental protection laws could be subverted as well because of how 
people use land to produce food. 
While it’s true that issues like food insecurity need to be addressed, both in the state 
and nationwide, bills like this do nothing to provide any meaningful solution. Instead, 
they would weaken laws impacting animals and the environment. Please oppose LD 
1823!
