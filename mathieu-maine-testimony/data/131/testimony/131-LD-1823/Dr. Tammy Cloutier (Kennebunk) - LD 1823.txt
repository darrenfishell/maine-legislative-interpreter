LD 1823
Dear Members of the Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry,
Unfortunately, I was not able to offer my testimony in person, so I am writing to urge 
you to OPPOSE LD 1823 An Act to Respect and Protect the Right to Food. Do not be
fooled by the title. At first glance this bill may seem to be in the best interest of Maine
citizens, but IT IS NOT.
 
LD 1823 is unacceptable for multiple reasons. This includes threatening multiple 
Maine statutes that offer critical protections to our wildlife, our environment, and 
Maine landowners while disrespecting the legislature’s authority and agencies that 
create and enforce these vital protections.
Please look carefully at the language that is hidden within this bill. LD 1823 is 
unacceptable as written because the harmful open-ended language can be twisted to:
•Eliminate numerous Maine statutes that protect landowners, wildlife, and the 
environment.
•Prohibit the enforcement of Maine’s wildlife, animal welfare, and environmental 
protection statutes.
•Legalize activities that are opposed by the majority of Mainers (including Sunday 
hunting and even participation in the bear bile trade) – with the state being unable to 
stop it.
•Designate OUR wildlife as objects that can be owned and used however one 
chooses, and equates killing wildlife for any reason to the act of picking berries or 
harvesting a crop.
The potential implications of the language in LD 1823 will have far reaching and 
dangerous effects for Maine, its citizens, its wildlife, and its environment. Please do 
not allow LD 1823 to move forward.
Thank you for your time.
