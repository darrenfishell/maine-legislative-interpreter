This bill is so loaded with problems I don’t even know where to begin. 
KEEPING IT PERSONAL & BRIEF: 
As a landowner of over 100 acres of prime fields, fruit trees, forests, bogs and all 
manner of flora: Raspberry-Blackberry and Blueberry bushes...Fiddlehead 
beds...Apple trees...old heirloom Pear tree...all within convenient walking distance 
from my house, I am wondering if now, people knowing they have A RIGHT TO 
FOOD on any un-posted land, would feel entitled to help themselves, whereas before,
it all being near a dwelling...they would keep driving by.
  
LD 1823 ~~>Nobody home.  A right to food.  Not posted. Why not take advantage of 
the “harvest?”  
Had this bill been about making life easier and supportive for our small farm farmers 
and the products they wish to make available for human consumption and/or actual 
hunger...I would support it 101% ! 
How did our wildlife and private property access to unlimited harvesting of 
mushrooms, fiddleheads, wild-berries, etc. get into the mix ?  Sunday 
hunting...already heading to the Supreme court.
Who will regulate all of the problems sure to arise?  How many lawsuits will be filed?
Please. Consider well, before passing this bill as written. I am thinking 
REVERSE-POSTING will be following on its heels. And with unquestionable reason 
and need.
