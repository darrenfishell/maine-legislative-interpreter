DATE OF HEARING: Wednesday March 8, 2022, 1:00 pm 
Honorable Senator LaFountain, Honorable Representative Landry, Distinguished 
Members of the Committee on the Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife: 
I am Keith Luke, Economic Development Director for City of Augusta, and I am here to speak in 
support of the construction of a new headquarters facility for the Department of Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife at the Kennebec Locke Site. 
As noted by others before me, the Locke Site represents a unique opportunity to leverage a 
dramatically situated property at the headwaters of the Kennebec River as a showcase for a new 
IF&W facility. It is not hard to imagine the kinds of outdoor programming that the IF&W could 
offer at the riverfront site, making it destination for sportsmen from around the state — and 
beyond, becoming an economic development asset that would beneﬁt the entire state. To help 
whet your appetite for what such a facility could look like, I am circulating a preliminary design 
we did for a client a few years ago for a 45,000sf project at the site. 
As the city’s economic development director, I sit on the Portland to Bangor Rail Propensity 
study group for MDOT, as well as the Lower Road Corridor Committee. I want to point out that 
the Lock site is crossed by rail, and if commuter rail is ever going to be viable in Augusta, 
whether in ﬁve years or ﬁfty, we need to start locating office buildings like the IF&W 
headquarters in convenient walking distance of the rail line. This would be an excellent place to 
begin.
