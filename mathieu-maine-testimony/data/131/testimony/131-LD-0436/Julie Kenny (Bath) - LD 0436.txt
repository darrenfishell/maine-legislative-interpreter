RE: IN FAVOR OF LD 436
As a Director at a Career and Technical Center in Maine, I strongly believe that LD 436 "An Act
to Provide Career and Technical Education Students with Credit Toward High School
Graduation for Work Completed in Career and Technical Education Centers and Regions" has
the capacity to create equal opportunities to CTE students.
The lack of current structure around CTE programs and graduation requirements means that
students from four different high schools might attend the same CTE program at the same CTE
school and receive different credits towards graduation. For example, one high school may give
science credit to a student in Electricity, while another sending school at the same CTE may
only give elective credits. The students are all receiving the same standards, the same
curriculum, and the same instruction, but are not receiving equal access to credits towards
graduation. Support of this bill would require high schools and CTE schools to propose
equivalency agreements that would allow CTE students to gain core credits towards graduation
through completion of career and technical education programming.
Requiring school administrative units to align CTE programs with core graduation requirements,
as agreed on based on specific program standards, will allow more students to access our
programs and attain the skills necessary to enter college or the workforce career ready.
Furthermore, this agreement will ensure that students receive equal access to graduation
credits for the same program completion.
Thank you for taking the time to read my testimony and I strongly urge you to support this bill.
