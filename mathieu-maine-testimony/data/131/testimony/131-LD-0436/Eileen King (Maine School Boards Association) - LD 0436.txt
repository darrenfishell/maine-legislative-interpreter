TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 436 
AN ACT TO PROVIDE CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WITH 
CREDIT TOWARD HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION FOR WORK COMPLETED IN CAREER 
AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTERS AND REGIONS 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 436. 
Our organizations support this bill and applaud the intent that will continue to promote collaboration between 
the CTE center or region and public high schools across the state. 
Many districts have worked hard to develop a cross-walk between the high school and the CTE programs their 
students attend. The courses offered in CTE programs are interdisciplinary in nature addressing a variety of 
content areas in one class. Allowing students to gain core credit toward a high school diploma through a valid 
and reliable assessment in their CTE classes provides students with a streamlined schedule that can open time 
to take other classes or enroll in extended leamingopportnnities. ., 
This bill calls for the CTE centers and regions to work collaboratively with school administrative units to 
propose equivalency agreements with the approval of the Commissioner. The educators who will do this work 
will do so keeping their students, staffing needs, and schedules in mind. We hope that the plans that are 
submitted by those in the ﬁeld will be accepted by the Commissioner.
