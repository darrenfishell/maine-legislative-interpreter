MEPRI has a study currently underway as part of our FY2023 work plan that may provide relevant data to inform your discussion. We have been tasked to “Explore emerging district practices in granting academic credit for knowledge gained in students’ CTE courses through interviews with district and CTE personnel.”   To inform the context of these practices, we have added a questionnaire to gather feedback from all CTEs (not just those already implementing pilot programs). This survey is exploring the extent to which CTE students find it a major challenge to complete core academic credits required for graduation on top of their CTE program work, and the underlying nature of those challenges.  The survey of CTE Directors is currently underway. We can be prepared to present the results at or before the work session for L.D. 436 if desired.   Sincerely,  Amy Johnson Co-Director, MEPRI
