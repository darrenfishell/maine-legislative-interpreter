Dear Honorable Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Kevin Stilphen, and I live in Cape Elizabeth. I am the Director of Portland Arts & 
Technology High School, a CTE center serving Cumberland County students. I am testifying 
today in support of LD 436 - An Act to Provide Career and Technical Education Students with 
Credit Toward High School Graduation for Work Completed in Career and Technical 
Education Centers and Regions. This legislation would provide the framework to allow all 
CTE students to earn academic credit by attending and completing a two-year CTE program. 
Currently, some students can earn academic credit in their CTE programming; however, 
others cannot. The decision to award academic credit is made by the students sending 
school. This approach creates inequity for students.CTE students earn college credit while 
enrolled; PATHS currently has 120 students earning college credit while attending PATHS. 
However, many of these students will only receive elective credit from their sending schools, 
no academic credit. CTE schools in Maine have cross walked their program curriculum 
multiple times to identify the academic content embedded in each program; we are deliberate 
and explicit about the academic credit we would recommend to sending schools. I believe this
bill would provide the impetus and structure to give all CTE students the same opportunity to 
earn academic credit while attending a CTE school.
Please consider supporting this bill.
Thank you for your time and efforts.
Sincerely,
Kevin J. Stilphen
