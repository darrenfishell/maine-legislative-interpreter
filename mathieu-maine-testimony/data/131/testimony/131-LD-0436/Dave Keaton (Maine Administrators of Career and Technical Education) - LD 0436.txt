TESTIMONY REGARDING 
L.D. 436 
An Act to Provide Career and Technical Education Students with 
Credit Toward High School Graduation for Work Completed in 
Career and Technical Education Centers and Regions 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee. I am Dave Keaton, Executive Director of Maine 
Administrators of Career & Technical Education, testifying on behalf of the CTE 
Directors of the Maine Administrators of Career & Technical Education (MACTE). 
MACTE would like to address LD 436 as we are in support of this bill. 
This bill requires school administrative units and career and technical education 
centers and regions to propose equivalency agreements that allow a secondary 
school student to gain core credit toward a high school diploma through career 
and technical education credit with approval from the Commissioner of 
Education. 
CTE Directors are encouraged by this bill as it would enable high school students 
more opportunities to pursue their career interest within their secondary education 
pathways. 
We would suggest the following for the implementation of this bill: 
1. A phase in period of up to 3 years to accomplish the equivalency agreements 
between the Maine CTEs and High Schools. 
2. Place the equivalency agreements in the CTE Center/Region Cooperative 
Agreements that is submitted annual 
We look forward to discussing this matter with all of you in future work sessions. 
Yours in education, 
1)aue ‘Keaton 
Dave Keaton, MACTE Executive Director
