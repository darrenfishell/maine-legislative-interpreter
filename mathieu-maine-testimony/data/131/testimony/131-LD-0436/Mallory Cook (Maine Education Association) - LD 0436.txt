Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and other esteemed members of the Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,   
 
My name is Mallory Cook (prono uns she/her/hers), and I am the Director of Training and Early 
Educator Engagement at the Maine Education Association. I am a certified English teacher and Building 
Administrator, and the proud daughter of a tradesman. I am writing to provide testimony in support of 
LD 436: An Act to Provide Career and Technical Education Students with Credit Toward High School 
Graduation for Work Completed in Career and Technical Education Centers and Regions.  
 
While working at Hermon High School, our team noticed an unme t need – an English class emphasizing 
real world application of literacy skills, built upon students’ career interests. This resulted in the 
inception of Technical English, a course targeted toward seniors enrolled in CTE programs. Each year, I 
would start  the course by asking how many students had a job. Without fail, almost every hand went up, 
and reinforced what I already knew: I had some of the hardest working, decisive students in my room. 
They knew their career ambitions; they were enrolled in courses  preparing them to meet the 
requirements of their respective industry, and they were taking on jobs outside of school to enhance 
those skills. For these students, relevance is paramount, and they choose to spend 50% of their school 
day in a setting built o n their interests, desires, and aspirations. In public schools we know the 
importance of project -based learning, and our CTE partners have embedded these practices in their work 
since their inception. Research has consistently shown that when students are engaged in school, they 
are less likely to drop out. Equivalency agreements are one way in which we can ensure the greatest 
number of students achieve successful certification, gainful employment, and boundless options.   
 
Equivalency agreements are happen ing in pockets of the state, but this bill would ensure equitable 
opportunities for all Maine students, prohibiting school boards from opting out of such agreements. 
Brewer High School has implemented what was noted as an exemplary example by the United 
Technologies Center in Bangor. Their team of administrators and school counselors completed a course 
crosswalk (see attached) that defines equivalency. Students who complete a year at their CTE program

receive 3 elective credits and one Brewer High School su bject credit. As examples, a student enrolled in 
Electronics and Advanced Manufacturing receives a science credit, while a Law Enforcement student 
can receive a Physical Education credit. Another example is Portland’s Arts and Technologies High 
School (PAT HS); their Program of Studies includes a description of each course, with a suggested 
equivalency course. In a collaborative effort between curriculum directors and CTE directors, this 
process could be outlined, refined, and streamlined to make it an acces sible procedure for all districts.   
 
When reviewing Maine’s Guiding Principles, CTE Program Standards, and our content learning 
standards, it is clear this is the right path for our state. As a former student and current Northern Maine 
Community College W elding student put it: “My CTE experience improved my confidence. Unlike the 
regular classroom setting, I was the star student. I wanted to be there. I wanted to learn. It’s time we re -
think traditional education and make these opportunities more worthwhil e for our CTE students.”  
 
I appreciate your time and consideration and welcome you to reach out with any questions.
