IN SUPPORT OF LD 181 
"ResoIve, Directing the Department of Health and Human Services to 
Implement Secure Children's Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility 
Services" 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Health & Human 
Services Committee, 
I'm Danielle Parent, Chief Growth Office at Sweetser and I'm here today to testify in support of 
LD 181, a Resolve, Directing the Department of Health and Human Services to Implement Secure 
Chi/dren's Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility Services. 
l don't want to have to be here today. l don't want this to be a service that is needed. I wish we 
could go back in time and prevent the adverse childhood events and circumstances that have led 
us here. However, the reality is that Maine children are being shipped off to other states and 
boarded inappropriately in emergency departments at high costs, because of this service gap. 
The need for this service is widely recognized by the provider community and the Maine 
Department of Health and Human Services. The department went so far as to establish PRFT 
MaineCare regulation in 2018. However, in the nearly 5 years since the establishment of Section 
107, no provider has implemented this service. 
The question becomes, why not? In credit to the department, they asked providers this very 
question in the summer of 2022 and we responded. The regulation as established is onerous and 
overly prescriptive. It provides for excessive staffing requirements and significantly insufficient 
reimbursement. The upfront costs of delivering this service are high and under supported. To be 
clear the proposed PRTF reimbursement does not come close to covering the regulatory 
requirements. . 
I encourage you to support this bill to require DHHS to take steps towards addressing the barriers 
of implementing this needed service. Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, 
Danielle Parent JD, LCSW 
Chief Growth Officer
