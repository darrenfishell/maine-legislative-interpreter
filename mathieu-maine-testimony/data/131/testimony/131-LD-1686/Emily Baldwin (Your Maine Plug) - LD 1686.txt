Your Maine Plug
LD 1686
My name is Emily Baldwin, I'm the medical caregiver of Your Maine Plug testifying 
in support of passing LD 1686. I live in a very rural area, miles away from any 
neighbors, and have dreams of homesteading one day with my family. I moved to 
Maine for that reason and believed it to be one of the few states that honors self 
sufficiency and regulation. I've seen that proven true and false in various ways 
throughout my time living here and it's legislation such as this that gives me hope in 
the future of this beautiful state. When it comes to self sufficiency, cannabis is a plant 
that can be utilized in countless ways to meet many of the needs and problems that 
individuals face in the household and on the farm. Every being that lives on my 
property, (humans, turkeys, ducks, and a cat), consumes the leaves, seeds, flowers, 
and even roots for a variety of reasons and plant count restrictions make it harder for 
my family and my animals to live healthier, happier lives on our own property. 
Restrictions prevent the very land from being healed of the damage done by previous 
owners. It's so far away from everything else that previous owners chose to dump 
their 'recycling' in the woods of the backyard. I would love to bioremediate the area 
with cannabis plants that would simply grow and then be cut and buried back into the 
ground but 6 plants isn't enough material. Farmers and homesteaders around all of 
Maine could remediate their soil, even if they only want to grow food or ornamental 
flowers. They could use it for cover crops, natural fertilizer, or a closed-loop feed 
supplement for themselves and/or their animals. Put the power back in the hands of 
the people to grow what they need for themselves.
