Good afternoon Chairperson Hickman and Chairperson Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee. My name is Scotty Ouellette, and l am a registered caregiver and owner/operator of 
a manufacturing laboratory in Maine. l am also in the process of dual certifying my manufacturing laboratory as 
an Adult Use facility. 
l am testifying in favor of LD1686, An Act to Eliminate Unconstitutional Restrictions on Access to Cananbis by 
Removing Certain Restrictions on Medical Use and Personal Use and to Recognize Cannabis and Hemp as 
Food Protected as a Right under the Constitution of Maine. l use cannabis as food every day to maintain my 
physical and mental well-being. Cannabis is food. 
My patients and clients desenre autonomy and personal choice in the grocery store, in the cannabis market 
and in their homes. l know some industry players may be hesitant to free the market, but home gardens do not 
make grocery stores obsolete. Please be mindful of creating meaningful and sensible laws from which 
meaningful and sensible rules can be derived. Thank you for your time and attention to this very important 
legal market in Maine.
