I wholeheartedly agree that we ought to eliminate unconstitutional restrictions on 
access to cannabis by removing certain restrictions on medical use and personal use. 
Furthermore I strongly believe we ought to recognize cannabis and hemp as food 
protected as a right under the Constitution of Maine
