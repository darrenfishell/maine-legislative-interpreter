Good morning Chairperson Hickman and Chairperson Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee. My name is Susan Meehan, and l am a registry identification cardholder who has 
been involved in Maine cannabis since 2013 as advocate, caregiver, consultant, formulator, patient, and parent 
of a patient — the late Cyndimae Meehan. My passion to protect the program stems from my daughter's valiant 
battle against Dravet Syndrome Epilepsy and how much cannabis helped her to live, love and laugh and enjoy 
her last 3 years with us in our Maine home sledding the hills and swimming in the cold mountain streams.. 
I am testifying in favor of LD1686, An Act to Eliminate Unconstitutional Restrictions on Access to Cananbis by 
Removing Certain Restrictions on Medical Use and Personal Use and to Recognize Cannabis and Hemp as 
Food Protected as a Right under the Constitution of Maine. l use cannabis as food every day to maintain my 
physical and mental well-being. Cannabis is food. Please remedy this nonsense and break out of the 1930’s 
stigma around this amazing plant. 
My patients and clients deserve autonomy and personal choice in the grocery store, in the cannabis market 
and in their homes. I know some industry players may be hesitant to free the market, but home gardens do not 
put grocery stores out of business. 
Thank you for your time and attention to this very important legal market in Maine. Patients are the center of 
this program and their choices should color our laws. Thank you for your time and attention.
