LD 1686
I am writing in support of LD 1686 and LD 1691. I have been a cannabis caregiver 
since 2010. The mantra at the outset of the program, then overseen by DHHS, was 
whatever benefits the patient is good for the program.  That is still true today.  The 
greater choice the patient has in every aspect of accessing their medicine is what is 
good for the program.  This bill LD 1686 brings home what ideally would have been 
all along.  The patient is free to grow or access cannabis in whatever manner they see 
fit.  This plant and its derivatives have helped so many in this state.  In a state with 
such a high per capita of veterans I believe they are helped exponentially.  I have 
helped many over the years and I know others have as well.
