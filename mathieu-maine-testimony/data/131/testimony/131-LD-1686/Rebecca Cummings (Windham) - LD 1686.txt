LD 1686
I am writing in opposition to LD1686. Marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug "drugs 
with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse" (DEA.gov). 
There is no nutritional value to marijuana or THC. 
I DO NOT SUPPORT ANY BILL WHICH NORMALIZES OR INCREASES 
ACCESS TO AN ILLEGAL DRUG IN THE STATE OF MAINE. 
LD1686 Ought Not Pass!
