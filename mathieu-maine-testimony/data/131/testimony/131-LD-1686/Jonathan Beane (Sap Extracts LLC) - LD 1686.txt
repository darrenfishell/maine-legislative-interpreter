This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
Good morning Maine's legislatures, 
Jonathan Beane here with Sap Extracts LLC, a local Maine caregiver. I am writing this email to support LD 1686. 
Cannabis restrictions are absolute blasphemy. Education and understanding is the future. Taxes are nice, but not when 
giant corporations write the rules for themselves. Maine is know for the tight nit community and doing things right for 
the individual. It's a plant, non toxic, and quite edible. You would need to properly decarboxylate the product for it to 
cause most any symptom cannabis is known for. With further support and research of this natural plant, Maine could 
change the way the rest of the country not only looks at cannabis, but how citizens of Maine can have control over their 
own plants/bodies. Sorry if this is the wrong spot to support a bill, but I'm trying to reach out where l can while keeping 
the garden flourishing for the plants/patients. Do what's right, not what will line corporations pockets with pointless 
dollars with the guise of ‚Äùhelping" out Maine. 
Best Regards, 
Jonathan Beane 
Maine Medical Caregiver and Resident
