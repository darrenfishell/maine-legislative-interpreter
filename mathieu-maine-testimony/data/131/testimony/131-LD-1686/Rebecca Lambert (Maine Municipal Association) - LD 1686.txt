In Opposition to  
 
LD 1686 - An Act to Eliminate Unconstitutional Restrictions on Access to Cannabis by Removing Certain 
Restrictions on Medical Use and Personal Use and to Recognize Cannabis and Hemp as Food Protected 
as a Right Under the Constitution of Maine  
 
April 24, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1 686 on behalf 
of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills 
of municipal intere st.    
Local leaders agree that this measure is a ridiculous attempt to insert the legality of cannabis and 
hemp into the constitution of Maine. Municipal officials work hard to uphold the will of their citizens and 
see this proposal as an attack on our democracy and the will of their voters in communities that have not opted in to allow cannabis businesses to operate.  
As stated in previous testimony, MMA and the LPC stand willing to adhere to the laws of Maine 
but reject any proposal to circumvent local control.  
Thank  you for your time and considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
