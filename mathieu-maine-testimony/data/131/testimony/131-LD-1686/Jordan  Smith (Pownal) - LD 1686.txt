LD 1686
Good Morning VLA members, I am writing today in support of LD 1686. I believe it 
is finally time to start calling cannabis what it is…. A plant. Including it in the food 
sovereignty law as food is a great way to do this. Every person should have the right 
to grow and consume any plant they choose and they do in fact already have that right
under our food sovereignty law. 
     As a cannabis business owner I understand this bill may not be entirely to my 
benefit but as a cannabis activists and as somebody who has a lifelong felony for 
growing a handful of plants I support it. My life was destroyed because some 
individuals believe so strongly that cannabis is not a plant but a dangerous drug 
capable of great harm. I have severe PTSD from my arrest and the way I was treated 
by our government. It’s been over 20 years and I still suffer daily from this. I hate see 
anyone be punished for gardening. We need to stop wasting valuable resources 
attacking and caging our own people. 
    Yes we “legalized” cannabis but that’s not really what happened. We made it so the
rich could appropriate an entire culture as another part of their investment portfolio 
while scamming investors at the same time. We left the people who truly deserve 
stake in the industry in the dark and in cages or buried in so much regulation that it is 
nearly impossible to operate. “legalization” has failed and passing a bill like this 
sends a strong message by truly freeing this plant. Thank you so much for your 
valuable time. 
Very Best,
Jordan Smith
