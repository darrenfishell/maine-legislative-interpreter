LD 1686
LD1686 is the most common sense bill that I have seen submitted yet. 
Please consider eliminating unconstitutional restrictions on access to 
cannabis by removing restrictions on medical use and 
personal use and to recognize cannabis and hemp as food 
protected as a right under the Constitution of Maine. This is a plant. 
Thank you for considering my testimony.
