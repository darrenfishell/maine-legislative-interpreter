Good morning esteemed committee members — I appreciate the opportunity to 
submit written testimony, as I am unable to be there in person. 
My point is a short one. If you are skeptical that cannabis is "food," allow me to refer 
to an article we published in the April issue of "Beer & Weed Magazine," wherein we
quote the state horticulturist Gary Fish, who works for the State Department of 
Agriculture:

Where Fish is pointing people, finally, is toward the grain marketplace. Hemp seeds 
can be ground into a meal that can be used in all sorts of baking and food-based 
applications. 
“I would think grain would be an excellent choice for Maine,” Fish says. Before CBD
took off, grain was the biggest hemp market in the U.S., often sold as hemp hearts — 
“I eat it pretty much every day on my cereal,” Fish says. They’re also working to get 
it approved for farm animals as something that can be mixed into their feed. 
Best of all, “we do have milling capabilities in Maine,” he says. “We have wheat 
growers and grain growers that do have processing equipment available and I do 
believe they could be adjusted for hemp grain as well. It’s a softer seed, so it has to be
done with a little less pressure.”

As you can see, cannabis is well-established as food and commonly grown for food, 
and it offers major opportunities as an agricultural product beyond intoxication.
