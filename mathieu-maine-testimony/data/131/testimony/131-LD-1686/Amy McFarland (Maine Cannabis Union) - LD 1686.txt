Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Amy McFarland. I am a patient, medical cannabis farmer and the President of 
Maine Cannabis Union. I also have a background in herbalism and holistic medicine. 
Today I am testifying as a Maine resident in full support of LD# 1686. 
Under Maine's Constitution Section 25 - (Right to Food) it states: 
All individuals have a natural, inherent and inalienable right to grow, raise, han/est, produce and 
consume the food of their choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and 
well-being as long as an individual does not commit trespassing, theft, poaching, or other abuse 
of private property rights, public lands or natural resources in harvesting, production or 
acquisition of food. (This should include cannabis.) 
Cannabis consumption dates as far back as 2,700 B.C. in China. 
Throughout history many cultures have used cannabis for both external and internal use on 
themselves and their animals. All parts of the plant are used, ﬂowers, roots and seeds. 
Cannabis seeds contain a considerable amount of protein and are rich in unsaturated fats. 
It has been reported that 100g of seeds can meet up to 63% of the required daily protein for 
humans. Cannabis seeds can be made into ﬂour, oil, or protein powder. 
One can also simply add a handful of seeds to their salad for increased nutrition. 
Now as for animals, studies have shown that chickens fed with a hemp seed diet provided eggs 
with 10 - 20% more enriched yolk with alpha linolenic acid, an omega-3‘ fatty acid. 
As a Maine resident who raises chickens for personal use, I should be allowed to grow enough 
seed to feed my ﬂock without requiring a special license. 
When I grew apples last year, no special license was needed. Nor was one needed for the hogs 
that then ate those apples. 
Having said that, I ask you all to vote in favor of LD# 1686. 
Thank you for your time, 
Amy McFarland
