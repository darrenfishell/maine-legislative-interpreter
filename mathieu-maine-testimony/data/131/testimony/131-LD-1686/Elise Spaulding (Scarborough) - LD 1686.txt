LD 1686
Goodmorning,
My name is Elise and I am a mother, wife, registered nurse and small business owner.
I am writing today in support of LD1686. I would like to preserve my right to grow 
my own food and medicine. 
We are a proud Veteran family that wants the best for our state and our community. 
My husband is a medically retired Marine and after countless trips to the VA he had 
given up hope that he would ever feel like himself again. After learning to grow his 
own medicine and after many failed attempts with antidepressants, anti anxiety 
medications and mood stabilizers he was finally able to find a medication that worked
for his needs. 
By removing these restrictions on medical and personal use you are allowing my 
family to help other Veterans in our community get the medicine that they need. You 
are also supporting my family in our journey to heal our wounds and reep the benefits
of this beautiful plant.
I hope that you consider this great opportunity to better serve the great residents and 
Veterans of Maine.
Sincerely,
Elise Spaulding
