RE:
LD
1664,
An
Act
to
Increase
Reimbursement
Under
the
General
Assistance
Program
Dear
Sen.
Baldacci,
Rep.
Meyer
and
members
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services 
Committee:
As
the
mayor
of
Lewiston,
I
would
like
to
voice
my
support
for
LD
1664.
The
passage
of 
this
bill
is
critical
to
the
city
of
Lewiston.
We
are
the
second
largest
city
in
the
state
and 
along
other
service
center
cities
in
Maine,
the
recent
growth
in
both
the
homeless 
population
and
asylum
seekers
has
placed
a
crushing
strain
on
our
General
Assistance 
department
and
funds.
Increasing
the
state
reimbursement
rate
from
70%
to
90%
is
necessary
to
meet
the
level 
of
need
we’ve
been
experiencing
as
a
city.
I
appreciate
Senator
Moore
for
sponsoring
this
bill
and
the
committee’s
time.
Sincerely,
Carl
L.
Sheline
