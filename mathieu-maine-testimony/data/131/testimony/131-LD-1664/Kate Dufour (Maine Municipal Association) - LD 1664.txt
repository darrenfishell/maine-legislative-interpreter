Testrmony of the Ma1ne Mun1c1pa1 Assoc1at1on 
In Support of 
LD 1664, An Act to Increase Rezmbursement Under the General Asszstance Program
& 
LD 1732, An Act to Expand the General Asszstance Program 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Ba1dacc1, Representatwe Meyer andlmembers and Serv1ces_ 
Commlttee My name 1s Kate Dufour, and I am test1fy1ng 1n support of LD 1664 and LD 1732 
on behalf of the 70 mun1c1pal leaders elected by the1r peers to serve on the Ass0c1at1on ’s 
Leglslatlve Pol1cy Commlttee and dlrected to establlsh pos1t1ons on b1lls of mun1c1pal 1nterest 
In each fall of an even numbered year, our newly elected pol1cy commlttee meets to 
establ1sh MMA’s two-year leg1slat1ve platform Our 2023-2024 platform mcludes LD 1664 and 
LD 1732, Wl’l1Cl1 Sen Moore and Rep Meyer have gracrously agreed to sponsor on our behalf 
GA Funding. LD 1664 1s elegant 1n 1ts s1mpl1c1ty, as 1t seeks to lncrease from 70% to 
90% state re1mbursement to mun1c1pal1t1es for the dlrect a1d provrded to el1g1ble appllcants As 
shown 1n the attached table extracted from OFPR’s 2022, Summary of Mayor State F undzng 
Dzstrzbuted to Munzczpalztzes and Countzes report, 1t 1s no surprlse to see that GA expendltures 
are on the r1se 
Between 2013 and 2022, the state’s share for GA expend1tures was roughly $112 
m1ll1on, annually However, as of late, the lmgermg effects of a global pandemlc and the 
resultlng ﬂlght to Mame, the rapld convers1on of year-round houslng to short-term rentals, a 
boommg housmg market, and the 1ncreas1ng costs of necesslties are all 1mpact1ng the GA 
program In 2023, state re1mbursement under the GA program _]l.lII1pCCl to $23 m1ll1on, rncreaslng 
the COII‘ll)1I16(l state and mun1c1pal expendlture to an all-t1me h1gh of $32 m1ll1on 
In add1t1on to reduc1ng the burden placed on the property taxpayers, the rncrease 1n state 
re1mbursement w1ll help to offset the cost of adm1n1ster1ng the program whrch 1s currently solely 
bome by the property taxpayers 
GA Program Reform. The Ass0c1at1on ’s more complex GA related b1ll seeks to 
address some of the rssues rarsed by the mun1c1pa1 ofﬁclals entrusted to admrmster the program 
and are berng advanced by a workmg group of mun1c1pal leaders and GA admrnrstrators from 
rural, suburban, and urban commumtres The concern among members of the MMA work1ng 
group 1s that whrle the program, Wl1lCh was once a resource of last resort, has morphed 1ntoa 
program that 1s necessary to supplement other state and federal assrstance programs, the laws and 
rules gu1d1ng the program’s 1mp1ementat1on have not kept up w1th the evolvmg envrronment 
The changes proposed 1n the b1ll seek to modennze the program by addressmg accountab1l1ty 
and resources
Tralnlng W1th respect to accountab1l1ty, the b1ll requ1res that mun1c1pal ofﬁc1als who 
are respons1ble for adm1n1ster1ng the program rece1ve tra1n1ng w1th1n 120 days of apporntment or 
electron to that ofﬁce To m1t1gate the cost of the mandate on property taxpayers, the proposal 
further d1rects the Department of Health and Hmnan Servrces to prov1de the tra1mng at no cost 
and make 1t accesslble e1ther 1n-person, onl1ne or v1a a pre-recorded v1deo The b1ll also mcludes 
a provlsion requ1r1ng state agency ofﬁc1als who are respons1ble for the adm1n1strat1on, 
1mplementat1on, and enforcement of the program to pa1t1c1pate 1n an annual tra1n1ng program 
Emergency Assistance. Th1s b1ll 1s not w1thout1ts pam po1nts, however, as the proposal 
requ1res the 1mp]ementat1on of after-hours emergency ass1stance procedures dur1ng regular 
mun1c1pal ofﬁce hours should the GA ofﬁce be closed at the t1me an 1nd1v1dual requests and 1s 1n 
urgent need of mslstance 
Municlpallty of Responslblllty. Add1t1onally, the b1ll amends the “mun1c1pal1ty of 
respons1b1l1ty ” statutes to sh1ft the costs of prov1d1ng a1d more falrly among all commun1t1es 
thereby rel1ev1ng the pressures placed on mun1c1pal1t1es that host accommodatrons and serv1ces, 
such as hotels, shelters, nurs1ng homes and soc1al serv1ces provlders To that end, 1n s1tuat1ons 
where an adm1mstrator helps someone relocate to another mun1c1pal1ty, the send1ng mun1c1pal1ty 
would be l1ab1e to fund the ass1stance prov1ded to relocated 1nd1v1duals for s1x months, rather 
than the 30 days as prov1ded for 1n ex1st1ng statute That sectlon of the b1ll also amends the 
statute regardmg placements 1n 1nst1tut1ons, mak1ng the commumty to wh1ch the appl1cant 
1ntends to return responslble for 12 months of ass1stance, rather than s1x months 
State Relmbursement. In exchange, however, the b1ll seeks more adequate 
re1mbursement from the state In add1t1on to 1ncreas1ng state re1mbursement for the dlrect a1d 
provlded, the proposal seeks re1mbursement for a portlon of adm1mstrat1ve expenses and for the 
costs assoclated wrth prov1d1ng temporary hous1ng, 1nterpreter serv1ces and above maxlmum 
l1m1t emergency ass1stance 
State Assistance & Resources S1nce mun1c1pal ofﬁcrals are requrred by state statute to 
a1d when 1nd1v1duals are 1n need, regardless of the t1me of day, the b1ll requ1res the state to 
prov1de 1n-person techn1ca1 ass1stance 24 hours a day To better 1nform mun1c1pal1t1es of the 
requrrements of the program, the b1ll also requrres the state to prov1de a wr1tten response w1th1n 
24 hours of a mun1c1pal program-related 1nqu1ry, 1nclud1ng a reference to the statute or rule used 
to 1ssue the guldance 
,F1nally, the b1ll d1rects the state to prov1de mun1c1pal admmrstrators access to a statew1de 
database to ass1st1n the process of properly determ1n1ng an appl1cant ’s el1g1b1l1ty 
MMA 1s avallable and w1ll1ng to work w1th the Comm1ttee, sponsors and mterested 
partres to develop consensus on the best path forward
