Re Support of LD 1426, LD 1664, and LD 1732, Opposition of LD 1675 
Dear Sen Baldacci, Rep Meyer, and HHS Committee Members 
The City of South Portland urges your support of LD 1426 An Actto Secure Housing for the 
Most Vulnerable Maine Residents by Amending the Laws Governing Municipal General 
Assistance, LD 1664 An Act to Increase Reimbursement Under the General Assistance 
Program, and LD 1732 An Act to Expand the General Assistance Program; and opposition to 
LD 1675 An Act to An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the General Assistance Program 
Regarding Eligibility, Housing Assistance and State Reimbursement and to Establish a 
Working Group. 
The General Assistance (GA) program has long had its flaws, but the pandemic and recent 
housing crisis have exposed even more weaknesses The three pieces of legislation we 
support will strengthen GA both for those in need, as well as for the municipalities that 
administer the program 
LD 1426 §Support1 
While we are generally opposed to adding more burdens onto the ever-growing list of tasks 
municipalities must perform, requiring GA training is a worthy exception and this bill provides 
for that GA officials in some smaller communities do not fully understand the program and 
its requirements, especially when administering GA is not the primary, secondary, or even 
tertiary duty of the staff person to whom it is assigned If the officials charged with 
administering the program do not understand its benefits, timelines, and other requirements, 
we cannot be sure those in need are receivingthe services they may be entitled to In addition, 
when officials are unaware of certain requirements such as being available to handle 
emergency applications and responding within 24 hours, clients will seek out other 
municipalities that have full-time staff, thus unfairly burdening those other communities 
Unfortunately, we have experienced this in South Portland 
LD 1426 also provides needed reforms to the maximums that GA can provide for housing 
assistance In this unprecedented housing market, the GA rent maximums are often 
insufficient, especially in Cumberland County In South Portland, we have a hard time finding 
rents that fall within these guidelines Although municipalities on their own can exceed 
maximums, this presents two problems — first, the State will not reimburse for that additional 
amount (except for in emergency situations for up to 30 days), and second, since most 
communities do not exceed maximums, those who do become magnets and end up bearing

the burden of the region's unhoused and housing insecure Basing GA rent maximums on 
more realistic data will lead to an increase in the amounts that Maine towns and cities can 
pay for rental assistance, thus opening up far more housing opportunities than currently 
available 
South Portland believes GA should be administered on a regional level, or ideally at the State 
level This would better ensure that all municipalities have a role in funding and serving as 
host for those in need, rather than mainly relying on larger service centers for assistance 
Homelessness truly IS a statewide issue Since a state or regional model IS not currently being 
considered, one small way to better ensure all Mainers have a hand in assisting those in need 
is by increasing the State’s share of General Assistance from 70% to 90%, as proposed in LD 
1426 In South Portland, we anticipate a half million-dollar beneﬁt next fiscal year at this 
higher reimbursement rate 
LD 1426 also requires the State to respond to municipal inquiries within a 24-hour timeframe 
and to maintain a client database, which is necessary to help expedite determinations of GA 
eligibility 
Finally, LD 1426 recognizes that GA costs are not just limited to providing rental assistance 
or food vouchers Hiring and training staff and providing them with office space and other 
benefits is also a cost of the program For the first time this bill would recognize that these 
costs also place a burden on municipalities, especially larger ones with multiple staff, and are 
worthy of some reimbursement LD 1426 calls for a 5% reimbursement of GA administrative 
costs to Maine's towns and cities For South Portland, this means approx $15,000 in savings 
LD 1664 gsupportl 
Similar to LD 1426, this bill would increase GA reimbursement from 70% to 90%, resulting ina 
savings to South Portland taxpayers of nearly half a million dollars We support this change 
LD 1732 §SupQort1 
This IS another critical piece of legislation Similar to LD 1426, this bill requires training for 
GA officials, increases the State’s reimbursement to municipalities from 70% to 90%, and 
provides for a statewide GA database It further expands on LD 1426 by not just requiring 24- 
hour technical assistance from the State, but also mandating that decisions from the State 
must be put in writing and cite the law or rule upon which their determination was made This 
is essential as at times municipalities receive conflicting guidance from the State — often 
verbally- and some decisions appear to be more arbitrary than rooted in the rule of law This 
can lead to situations where requirements are imposed on municipalities that are not actually 
legally mandated, or disallowing actions that are 
This legislation also helps to diminish the perverse incentive municipalities have to place their 
GA clients into other communities to save money Currently, if a municipality places a GA client 
into housing in another community, they only need to pay for one month of assistance, after 
which the new municipality becomes responsible Or, if a community places a GA client into 
temporary housing such as a hotel or shelter in another town or city, they only need to pay 
for six months of assistance before it becomes the other community's responsibility LD 1732 
would increase those timelines from one month to SIX months, and SIX months to 12 months, 
respectively
During the pandemic, hundreds if not thousands of GA clients were placed into South Portland 
hotels by other municipalities, thus placing a massive strain on our GA staff and budget While 
other communities saved money by doing this, South Portland had to hire more GA staff and 
raise taxes and use ARPA funding to cover skyrocketing GA costs In addition, the strain this 
influx of unhoused into our hotels placed on our public safety personnel was significant At 
the height of the pandemic in 2021, calls for service to our Police and Fire/EMS Departments 
increased by 256% over pre-pandemic numbers, meaning we were responding to over seven 
calls per day on average Just to our hotels Although we have taken steps to improve this 
situation, calls were still up 155% last year 
Finally, like LD 1426 this bill provides for a needed 5% reimbursement of GA administrative 
costs, but also reimburses 100% of the costs incurred for certain medical expenses, 
emergency assistance that exceeds maximums, temporary housing, and interpreter 
services This is a vast improvement over LD 1664 and would yield tens of thousands of 
dollars more in savings annually for South Portland
/ 
LD 1675 §Oppose} 
Although we appreciate some aspects of this bill, South Portland opposes LD 1675 as it 
contains some undesirable elements For starters, it limits which communities would receive 
a 90% reimbursement under the GA program based on a formula involving GA expenditures 
and the municipality's assessed valuation Instead of relying on a mathematical formula, we 
believe the State should recognize its primary role in assisting unhoused and housing 
insecure individuals and simply cover 90% of the costs for all communities More concerning, 
this bill proposes a working group be formed with the purpose of turning GA on its head from 
a program of last resort to a housing navigator/assistance program This additional burden 
is not the role for municipalities, and we prefer the approach in other legislation such as the 
Speaker's Bill LD 1721 to address housing issues 
Thank you for your consideration
