Re LD 1426, An Act to Secure Housing for the Most Vulnerable Maine Residents by Amending the 
Laws Governing Municipal General Assistance 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services Committee, 
my name is Cullen Ryan, and I am the Executive Director of Community Housing of Maine (CHOM) 
CHOM houses Maine’s most vulnerable people and advocates on behalf of these broader populations I 
am a member of the Statewide Homeless Council and also chair the Maine Homeless Policy Committee 
and the Maine Continuum of Care Board of Directors 
My testimony is in support of LD 1426, An Act to Secure Housing for the Most Vulnerable Maine 
Residents by Amending the Laws Goveming Municipal General Assistance This bill would makea 
number of changes to the General Assistance (GA) program speciﬁcally regarding GA rental assistance 
LD 1426 
1 Requires an overseer, no later than the 120th day following appointment or election, to complete 
training on the requirements of the municipal GA program, 
2 Replaces, for determining the maximum level of assistance, the fair market value determination 
with setting the assistance at the equivalent amount of rental assistance provided for tenant-based 
housing choice vouchers under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 193 7 except that the 
beneﬁt level may not be less than the difference between the applicant's income and 110% of the 
area ’s fair market rent, 
3 Provides that if GA is being used to pay rent for an applicant whose rent is Sllb_]8Cl to a lease an 
overseer may redetermine the applicant's eligibility annually, 
4 Increases from 70% to 90% the amount of state reimbursement for the costs of GA incurred bya 
municipality and each Indian tribe, 
5 Directs the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to reimburse each municipality for 
5% of the direct costs of paying beneﬁts incurred through its GA program, 
6 Directs DHHS to establish and provide overseers with access to a statewide database for tracking 
applicants for the GA program and expenses relating to the program, and 
7 Requires DHHS to provide assistance to municipalities with regard to processing applications for 
the GA program and directs the Department to establish a hotlme that is available 24 hours per 
day in order to provide consistent, accurate advice to overseers It also requires the department to 
respond to requests for assistance within 24 hours 
LD 1426 would ensure there 1S an adequate safety net through common sense changes to the GA 
program This bill makes improves and streamlines GA laws/policies to remove barriers and simplify 
access/use speciﬁcally for housing The changes this bill makes would essentially allow GA rental 
assistance to function similar to rental subsidies like Section 8 by tying the rent maximums to 110% of 
fair market rent, and by extending the period of eligibility to one year for people covered by an annual 
lease These changes to GA rental assistance are long overdue and would assist thousands of vulnerable 
Mainers in remaining stably housed and preventing homelessness 
GA administration varies greatly throughout Maine This bill would improve unifonnity across the 
state, make it more equitable, and create a reasonable rate of State reimbursement for GA costs bome by 
municipalities And this bill would solve many programmatic inconsistencies, improving our system of 
care and our safety net for Maine’s most vulnerable people 
General assistance 1S Maine’s safety net of last resort It protects thousands of Mainers by keeping a 
roof over their heads when they have nowhere else to turn We will all be better for having an improved 
General Assistance program in Maine People would be better served by their local GA programs if this 
bill were to become law
