‘,Fm1r8la:»I3~arli3 Hello Cha|r Baldacc|, Cha|r Meyer, and honorable members of the Commnttee on Health 
and Human Servuces, 
My name |s Taylor Cray, and I am the Outreach Team Leader w|th Preble Street's 
Advocacy Team I am here today to ask that you please vote |n support of LD 1664 An Act 
to Increase Relmbursement Under the General Assnstance Program and LD 1732 An Act 
to Expand the General Assnstance Program 
These b||ls advocate for expandmg the State's ex|st|ng general ass|stance program to 
benef|t fam|l|es and mdlvlduals In the State of Mame These bl||S help to |mprove 
Ma|ners' access to thls ass|stance, both by decreasmg the number of tlmes that someone 
must apply for general ass|stance, and by helplng to reduce COI‘|fUSl0l‘l, barruers, and 
mconslstencles |n the program By requmng an overseer to complete tra|n|ng regardmg 
mumclpal general ass|stance, LD 1732 w|ll ensure that there IS always an |nd|v|dual 
avallable who possesses the knowledge and expertlse necessary to ass|st w|th the often- 
com pllcated process of adm|n|ster|ng general ass|stance At a tume when the cost of 
nearly every necessary resource, partlcularly hous|ng, |s r|s|ng, |t us vltal that we ensure 
that our general ass|stance program works to beneﬁt all Manners 
The mcrease |n general ass|stance relmbursement proposed by LD 1664 w|ll help to 
correct the current umbalances |n general ass|stance across the state The mcrease |n 
state relmbursement from 70% to 90% of general ass|stance costs w|ll mean that 
mun|c|pal|t|es and tr|bal governments w|th less revenue w|ll be able to ass|st more 
|nd|v|duals through the program Th|s also helps to lessen the f|nanc|al pressure on 
mun|c|paI|t|es and tr|baI governments For |nd|v|duals and fam|l|es |n need of ass|stance, 
the ab|l|ty to remam w|th|n thenr commumtles |s an |ncred|bly umportant element of 
stab|l|ty and support By mcreasmg general ass|stance re|mbursement, we can decrease 
the number of folks who are forced to move to access general ass|stance The strength of 
commumty IS a deeply lmportant aspect of ensur|ng the health and well-bemg of 
Manners, and these bIl|$ w|ll help to ensure that commun|t|es are not fragmented due to 
f|nanc|aI reasons 
I ask that you please vote |n favor of both LD 1664 and LD 1732 
Thank you for your t|me and cons|derat|on 
Smcerely, 
Taylor Cray
