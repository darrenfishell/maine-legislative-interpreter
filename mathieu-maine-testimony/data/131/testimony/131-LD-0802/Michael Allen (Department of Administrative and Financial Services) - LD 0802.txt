TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: March 30, 2023 
LD 802 — “An Act to Increase the Maine Exclusion Amount for Estate Tax 
Exemptions ” 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee -— good afternoon, my name is Daniel D’Alessandro, Associate Tax 
Policy Counsel in the Maine Revenue Services, Office of Tax Policy. I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Neither For Nor Against LD 802, 
“An Act to Increase the Maine Exclusion Amount for Estate Tax Exemptions. ” 
This Bill proposes to increase the Maine estate tax exclusion amount (“Maine 
exclusion amount”) from $5,600,000 to $12,000,000 for estates of decedents dying 
on or after January 1, 2023. 
Very brieﬂy, the Maine estate tax exclusion amount operates as follows. 
Only estates Worth more than the Maine exclusion amount are subject to the Maine 
estate tax. The Maine estate tax exclusion for decedents dying after 2017 is 
$5,600,000 adjusted annually for inﬂation. Thus, for decedents dying in 2023, the 
adjusted exclusion amount is $6,410,000. There are three Maine estate tax rates, 
8%, 10%, and 12%, applicable to the Maine taxable estate exceeding the Maine 
exclusion amount. Currently, the federal uniﬁed credit against estate tax is 
$12,920,000. See Table A attached for federal and Maine exclusion amounts for 
2011 through 2023.

Turning to important administrative and technical aspects of the bill, the 
Administration notes the following timing point. This bill proposes to increase the 
Maine estate tax exclusion amount for the estates of decedents dying on or after 
January 1, 2023, and Maine estate tax returns are due nine months after the date of 
death. The application date of the bill presents signiﬁcant timing concems. If 
enacted into law, the proposed increase in the exclusion amount will have an 
adverse effect on existing 2023 estate tax forms and instructions currently being 
used, may cause amended returns to be ﬁled, and refunds to be issued. Even if the 
proposal were enacted as emergency legislation, it would be difﬁcult for MRS, 
producers of tax software, tax preparers, and individuals to respond to the proposed 
changes for decedents dying during 2023. It would be more feasible to implement 
the changes if the bill applied to decedents dying on or after January 1, 2024. 
The Administration also notes the following technical concerns: 
I The inﬂation adjustment required under 36 M.R.S. § 4119, referencing 
36 M.R.S. § 4102(5), should be updated to reﬂect the Chained Consumer 
Price Index for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2022, begirming 
with the annual adjustment required to be made on or about September 
15, 2023. 
I In any given year, the Maine exclusion amount proposed by the Bill, 
when adjusted for inﬂation under 36 M.R.S. § 4119, could be higher than 
the federal exclusion amount. 
The estimated revenue impact for deaths occurring in calendar year 2024 isa 
revenue loss of approximately $9 million per year beginning in fiscal year 2025. 
The estimated administrative costs are nominal and can be absorbed by the 
Bureau.

The Administration looks forward to Working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Cornmittee ’s questions.
