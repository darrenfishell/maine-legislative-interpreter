Elzgzbzlzty, Housmg Asslstance and State Rezmbursement and to Establzsh a Workmg Group 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Baldaccr, Representat1ve Meyer and members of the Health and Human Servlces 
Commlttee My name 1s Kate Dufour, and I am test1fy1ng 1n oppos1t1on to LD 1675 on behalf of 
the 70 I1'lLll'11C1pal leaders elected by therr peers to serve on the Assoc1at1on ’s Leg1s1at1ve Pol1cy 
Connmttee and dlrected to estabhsh pos1t1ons on b1lls of munlcrpal mterest 
Calculatlon of Maxlmum. Munrclpal ofﬁc1als support the prov1s1on of the b1ll seek1ng 
to amend the way 1n wh1ch the max1mum level of assrstance 1s calculated However, slmply 
d1rect1ng mun1c1pal1t1es to do so 1s not entrrely helpful as 1t places add1t1onal burdens on the 
property taxpayers who are left to bear the cost of adm1n1ster1ng the program wlthout any state 
re1mbursement Instead, the department should be drrected to calculate the max1mum levels of 
asslstance annually, and to dlssemlnate that 1nformat1on to mun1c1pal1t1es 1n a t1mely fashron 
The remalmng elements of LD 1675 are of greater concern 
Period of Ellgibillty. Although the b1ll allows, but does not mandate, communltles to 
prov1de up to s1x months of assrstance, there 1s nothrng 1n the brll to safeguard mun1c1pal1t1es 
from a state level claw back of re1mbursement should a rec1p1ent become 1nel1g1ble for asslstance 
dur1ng the s1x-month perlod Whlle the ab1l1ty to provlde ass1stance over a longer penod of tlme 
could serve as a tool for ensurlng the acqu1s1t1on of permanent houslng, wlthout prov1s1ons 1n 
statutes to protect mLu11c1pal1t1es, the lnvestment may present too hlgh of a nsk or too largea 
ﬁnanclal burden for property taxpayers to shoulder To put that ﬁgure 1nto context, the 
max1mum amount of asslstance that could be provlded to a smgle appl1cant res1d1ng 1n a studlo 
apartment ranges from a low of $4,152 1n an Aroostook County mun1c1pal1ty to a h1gh of $6,432 
1n a York County communlty 
State Reimbursement. The b1ll also comphcates and l1m1ts access to enhanced state 
relmbursement The property taxpayers 1n all mun1c1pal1t1es across the state deserve rehef As 
proposed 1n the b111, the state 1s only obhgated to mcrease relmbursement to 90% whena 
commumty mcurs GA costs 1n excess of 008% of a commun1ty ’s state assessed value 
Furthermore, the enhanced relmbursement appl1es only to the expendrtures over and above the 
threshold As an example, Augusta would have to spend $173,976 before tnggermg any 
enhanced rermbursement For the c1ty of Hallowell, the base would be $25,936 Whll6 the 
fundlng approach env1s1oned 1n LD 1675 comes W1th a less hefty ﬁscal note for the state, 
mumcrpal ofﬁc1als rnstead support 1ncreas1ng the rate of rermbursement from the current 70% to 
90% so all mun1c1pa11t1es beneﬁt
Study Group. F1nally, mun1c1pal ofﬁclals are gravely concerned w1th the open-ended 
approach to the creatlon of a worklng group drrected to convert GA 1nto a hous1ng program 
Wlthout any gurdance, d1rect1on or parameters, mumclpal ofﬁclals fear that the group’s 
recommendatlons could shlft addltlonal costs onto property taxpayers 
Over the course of th1s hearmg, you W111 be presented w1th many suggestlons for 
1mpr0v1ng the GA program, all w1th mer1t and worthy of further explorat1on and dlscusslon To 
that end, MMA 1s avallable and w1ll1ng to work w1th the Commlttee, sponsors and 1nterested 
partles to develop consensus on the best path forward 
Thank you for consldenng the mun1c1pa1 perspect1ve on th1s lssue If you have any 
questlons about the Assoc1at1on ’s pos1t1on on th1s b111, please do not hesltate to contact me at
