LD 1675
As past president of the Maine Welfare Directors, I strongly support LD 1732, this 
bill written by members of MWDA, MMA and other stakeholders is extremely 
important for both small and large municipalities.
It is not often that small rural communities and larger cities can agree on GA issues, 
but in this case we do.
