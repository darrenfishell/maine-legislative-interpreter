‘ﬁz it ﬁr ﬁr.‘ 
faur Sm (mitt; Hello Cha|r Baldaccl, Cha|r Meyer, and honorable members of the Committee on Health 
and Human Sennces, 
My name as Taylor Cray, and I am the Outreach Team Leader w|th Preble Street's 
Advocacy Team I am here today to ask that you please vote "ought to support" on LD 
1426 An Act to Secure Housmg for the Most Vulnerable Mame Res|dents by Amendmg 
the Laws Govermng Mun|c|pal General Asslstance and LD 1675 An Act to Amend the 
Laws Govermng the General Asslstance Program Regardmg El|g|b|l|ty, Housmg Assnstance, 
and State Relmbursement and to Establlsh a Workmg Group 
Utlluzmg general asslstance funds to asslst wlth rental costs prevents many Mamers from 
facmg the constant uncertamty of housmg |nstab|l|ty |n an mcreasmgly unaffordable 
housmg and rental market These bl||S help to lmprove Mamers’ access to th|s asslstance, 
both by decreasmg the number of lI|ﬂ’l8S that someone must apply for general assnstance, 
and by helpmg to reduce confusnon, barrlers, and |ncons|stenc|es |n the program By 
requ|r|ng an overseer to complete tra|n|ng regardmg mumclpal general assustance, LD 
1426 w|ll ensure that there |s always an |nd|v|duaI avanlable who possesses the knowledge 
and expertlse necessary to assnst w|th the often-compllcated process of adm|n|ster|ng 
general asslstance The workmg groups suggested by LD 1675 w|ll help to streamlune 
general asslstance processes |n ways that are benef|c|al for the mdnvlduals and fam|l|es 
rece|v|ng general asslstance, and for the mun|c|pal|t|es adm|n|ster|ng the program Ata 
tume when the cost of nearly every necessary resource, partncularly housmg, IS r|s|ng, |t IS 
v|tal that we ensure that our general assnstance program works to beneﬁt all Mamers 
The mcrease |n general assustance renmbursement proposed by both b|lls w|l| help to 
correct the current nmbalances |n general asslstance across the state The mcrease |n 
state renmbursement from 70% to 90% of general asslstance costs Wlll mean that 
mun|c|pal|t|es and trlbal governments w|th less revenue w|ll be able to asslst more 
|nd|v|duals through the program Thls also helps to lessen the fmanclal pressure on 
mun|c|pal|t|es and tr|bal governments For |nd|v|duals and fam|l|es |n need of asslstance, 
the ab|l|ty to remam w|th|n thelr commumtles IS an mcredlbly lmportant element of 
stab|l|ty and support By Increaslng general assnstance relmbursement, we can decrease 
the number of folks who are forced to move to access general asslstance The strength of 
commumty IS a deeply nmportant aspect of ensurmg the health and well-bemg of 
Mamers, and these b|lls w|ll help to ensure that communmes are not fragmented due to 
f|nanc|aI reasons 
I ask that you please vote |n favor of both LD 1426 and LD 1675 
Thank you for your t|me and conslderatlon 
Smcerely, 
Taylor Cray
