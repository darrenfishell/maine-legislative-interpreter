Th1s b1ll proposes the followmg changes

every 6 months, 
3 Increases to 90% the amount of state rermbursement for the costs of general ass1stance 
rncurred by a mumclpalrty and each Ind1an trlbe when a mun1c1pal1ty mcurs net general 
ass1stance costs 1n excess of 0 008% of that mun1c1pa11ty's most recent state valuatlon, 
4 Create a workmg group to conduct a study and that no later than December 6, 2023 shall 
make recommendatrons related to a unlform mtake process and the conversron of the 
general ass1stance program 1nto a housmg ass1stance program 
Maine Equal J ustlce supports LD 1675 because: 
Many of the changes proposed by thrs b1ll have been recommended by leglslatrvely created GA 
workrng groups that extenslvely rev1eWed the general ass1stance program 1n the past Those
l
\ 
working groups always consisted of a diverse group of stakeholders, including Maine Equal 
Justice, Maine Mumcipal Association, housing developers, and others1 
This bill will make general assistance a more reliable source of assistance for both 
landlords and low-income tenants 
1 Making the GA program to work like a voucher program would make landlords see the 
program as a more reliable source of income, making it easier for people to obtain 
housing when they apply Currently, GA primarily functions as a rental assistance 
program and has worked this way for a long time This 1S the main source of rental 
assistance for most of Maine’s residents with extremely low income, but for reasons such 
as the program looking different in every town and the short eligibility periods, landlords 
are more likely to rent to someone with a Section 8 voucher than a GA voucher Section 
8 vouchers cover the actual cost of rent for the tenant minus 30% of the tenant’s income 
if GA maximums are calculated the same way, more tenants will be able to afford to be 
housed Right now, the fair market value 1S way beyond the average income of a Mainer 
with low income Maine Equal Justice’s clients are people with income at or below 250% 
of the poverty level, meaning they would all beneﬁt from this change 
2 By increasing the eligibility period for rental assistance from 30 days to 6 months, 
tenants and landlords alike won’t have to wony about having a place to live every month 
or being paid every month This is another measure that makes the program more reliable 
for all parties involved - even the GA ofﬁcers who Won’t have to be overwhelmed by 
processing dozens of GA applications for rental assistance This 1S especially true for the 
larger cities that have robust GA programs and offer many other necessary resources for 
those that need it (1 e , Portland, Bangor, etc) 
Increasing the Reimbursement Rate for Municipalities will Increase the Sustainability of 
the Program 
By increasing the rate of reimbursement to 90% for GA expenditures for mumcipalities that have 
the highest general assistance costs, more people will be able to get the amount of assistance 
they need, because GA overseers will know that the money will come back to the towns If 
municipalities can better rely on the state to support them ﬁnancially, the rental assistance will 
be more generous for applicants, and in turn be more reliable for landlords when considering 
rent applications The impact that this change would have in terms of keeping more people 
sheltered 1S immense A high rate of reimbursement which is guaranteed to municipalities for 
something such as rental assistance would make GA a more reliable source of rent in the eyes of

landlords, reduclng the r1sk of source of 1ncome d1scr1m1nat1on and lncreaslng the number of people who would be able to ma1nta1n hous1ng and shelter 
Before clos1ng, I would also l1ke to address the proposal to have a worklng group examlne turnlng GA 1nto a houslng program We don’tbel1eve addltlonal worklng groups are needed glven that We have the recommendatlons from prevlous worklng groups to help lnform the changes that can strengthen GA However, 1f a Worklng group 1s convened, 1t should not focus on l1m1t1ng what baslc needs GA can support Wh1le GA has prlmanly been used for houslng 1n recent years, partlclpants st1ll ut1l1ze 1t for other needs, 1nclud1ng food and health needs We would not want to see that ﬂex1b1l1ty lost 
CONCLUSION 
LD 1675 1s a common-sense proposal to streaml1ne the de11very of asslstance to people who are 1n need of shelter and rental ass1stance at th1s unprecedented tlme, help ensure that the mun1c1pal1t1es that bear the l1on’s share of resp0ns1b1l1ty for provldmg GA to vulnerable people 1n the state can contlnue to do so 1n a way that 1s efﬁclent, susta1nable, and 1n accordance w1th the law, and overall make the program more rel1able Many of these proposals are the recommendauons from GA worklng groups that represented the 1nterests of all stakeholders For these reasons, I urge you to pass LD 1675 
I am happy to answer any quest1ons
