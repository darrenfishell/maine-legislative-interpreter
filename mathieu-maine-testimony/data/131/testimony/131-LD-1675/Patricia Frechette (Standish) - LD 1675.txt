Dear Committee Members:
Leave it alone.   Do you need to be reminded that this is NOT YOUR MONEY $$$ 
that you spend.  Give the taxpayers a break.  No more FREEBIES!!!   The bill also 
directs the department to establish a working group to study and make 
recommendations related to a uniform intake process and the conversion of the 
general assistance program into a housing assistance program.  Why has this not been 
done before?  Also, why are welfare recipients not checked upon so that they are not 
lying about needing welfare?
I ask that you vote OUGHT NOT to PASS, Thank you.
