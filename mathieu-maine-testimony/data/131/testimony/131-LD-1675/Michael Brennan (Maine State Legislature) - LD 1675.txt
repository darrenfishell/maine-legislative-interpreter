LD 1675, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the General Assistance Program Regarding 
Eligibility, Housing Assistance and State Reimbursement and to Establish a Working Group 
Before the Jomt Standing Commzttee on Health and Human Servzces 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and distinguished members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee I am Michael Brennan, and I represent House District 115, which 
mcludes a portion of Portland I am here to introduce LD 1675, An Act to Amend the Laws 
Governing the General Assistance Program Regarding Eligibility, Housing Assistance and State 
Reimbursement and to Establish a Working Group. 
As you know, our General Assistance program is crucial ni temporarily helping those who need it most 
by providing fimdmg for the most basic necessities including food and shelter 
This bill amends the current law regarding Mame’s General Assistance program Under this bill,a 
municipality must calculate housing assistance equivalent to the amount of rental assistance provided 
for tenant-based housing choice vouchers under Section 8 The bill also extends the period of 
eligibility from one month to six months 
Beginning July l, 2023, when a municipality mcurs net General Assistance costs in excess of 0 008% 
of that municipality's most recent state valuation relative to the state ﬁscal year for which 
reimbursement 1S being issued, this bill calls that DHHS reimburse the municipality for 90% of the 
amount in excess of these expenditures The bill also directs DHHS to establish a working group to 
study and make recommendations related to a uniform intake process and the conversion of the 
General Assistance program into a housing assistance program 
Durmg the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people were reliant on assistance they were 
receiving from the federal rental assistance program, which has since ended When that program 
ended, those same people turned to Maine’s General Assistance program for help Municipalities 
across the state have been hard hit by nsmg General Assistance-related costs This bill will help our 
mimicipalities provide support for our more economically vulnerable residents 
Thank you for your consideration of this legislation I am happy to answer any questions you have
