Chair Baldacci, Chair Meyer, Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services 
My name is Tobin Williamson I live m Lewiston and I am the Advocacy Manager with the 
Maine Immigrants ’ Rights Coalition (MIRC), a statewide network of almost 100 member 
organizations working to enhance the lives of Maine’s immigrant communities MIRC works to 
advance systemic changes in Maine through collaborative advocacy to ensure that voices of the 
state’s large, diverse, and growing immigrant coimnunities are heard 
L D 1675 proposes a niunber of changes to the General Assistance program that we feel are 
solid ideas For example, it changes the application renewal period for all types of G A from 
monthly to every six months, reducmg the time burden for both applicants and administrators It 
changes the reimbursement rate to municipalities to 90% mstead of 70%, easmg the financial 
burden for Maine’s municipalities that are struggling the most with soanng costs Finally, a new 
working group will be formed in order to make recommendations about making the GA 
program more consistent in each town and more efﬁcient in helpmg with housing costs All this 
sounds good to usl 
We are proud to support L D 1675 and hope you will do the same Thank you very much for 
your consideration of this important issue
