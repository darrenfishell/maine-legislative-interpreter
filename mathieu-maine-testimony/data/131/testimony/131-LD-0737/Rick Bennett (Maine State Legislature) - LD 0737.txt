THE MAINE SENATE 
13 l st Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Richard A. Bennett 
In Support of LD 737, "An Act to Prohibit Government Contracting Organizations from 
Inﬂuencing Elections" 
8 March 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal 
Affairs, I am Senator Rick Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of serving 14 communities in 
Western Maine in the State Senate. I am pleased to cosponsor LD 737, An Act to Prohibit 
Government Contracting Organizations from Inﬂuencing Elections. 
LD 737 requires that every contract with the State, in an amount over $500,000, have a clause 
that prohibits the contracting party from inﬂuencing state elections through political 
contributions for the duration of the contract plus two years." 
This legislation eliminates potential conﬂicts of interest and forestalls an avenue of corruption. 
Money is fungible within these entities, and it is inappropriate to even indirectly use public funds 
to inﬂuence elections outside of the Maine Clean Elections Act. 
Additionally, state contracts should be awarded based on merit and responsible use of tax dollars. 
Those winning state contracts should not then feel obligated to make political contributions. 
Thank you.
