RE:  LD 737 : An Act to Prohibit Government Contracting Organizations  
  from Influencing Elections  
 
 
Good morning , Senator Hickman and Representative Supica . 
 My name is Benjamin Gaines, I am a resident  of Bruns wick, and I am he re today as 
a volunteer with Maine Citizens for Clean Elections. I am also an attorney, and in a 
former life was a professional campaign fundraiser.  I am submitting testimony in 
qualified support of LD 737 , and wish to emphasize a fe w important points from the 
MCCE testimony delivered by Anna Kellar.  
 
First, I join MCCE in strongly support the concept  of regulating state contractor 
influence on Maine elections, includi ng through independent expenditure 
campaigns. Mainers deserve to feel confident in the integrity of their state 
government, and erecting a contractor firewall  will help minimize even the 
appearance of corrupti on in bidding and procurement . As an aside, true source 
disclosure in political spending  would surely further this goal by ensuring that 
contractor funds  cannot be concealed behind  dark money.  
 
Second, I believe that the $500,000 contract threshold  contained in LD 737 is far too 
high, and a lower threshold o r even a complete ban th at mirrors  the federal 
prohibition  on contractor spending  would much better p romote confidence in state 
government . A focus on large contractors might be the right place to start , but I 
hope that t he scope of this legislation will eventually expand.  
 Third, as the MCCE testimony  details, several terms , notably including “contract ” 
and “contribution ” lack definitions  in the current bill . The legislation would be 
strengthened with greater clarity so that regulated entities  — and the public  at 
large — are better able to discern exactly who and what entities and conduct  are to 
be regulated.  
 That said, I am happy to give my qualified support to this legislation, and thank 
you for your time. I have attached to my testimony a 201 6 report by Craig Holman, 
Ph.D., of Public Citizen , and Kyung rok Wi  of the  Democracy Law Project at Penn 
Law, on Pay -to-Play Restrictions on Campaign Contributions  
from  Government Contractors . 
Pay-to-Play Restrictions on Campaign Contributions  
from Government Contractors, 2016  
 
by Craig Holman, Ph.D. , Public Citizen;  
and Kyung rok Wi, Democracy Law Project at Penn Law  
 
 
Pay-to-play is the all -too-commo n practice of an individual or business entity making campaign 
contributions to a public official with the hope of gaining a lucrative government contract. 
Usually, though not  always,  pay-to-play abuses do not take the form of  outright bribery for a 
government contr act. Rather, pay -to-play more often  involves an individual or business entity 
buying access for consideration of a government contract.  
 
Using campaign contributions to influence the awarding of government contracts not only 
damages the integrity of the contracting process and undermines the public ’s confidenc e in 
government , it can also endanger otherwise promising careers of those who may be tempted to 
cross the line. Illinois Governor George Ryan, who was once rumored to be in the running for a 
Nobel Peace Prize, instead wa s convicted of corruption  and spent five years in prison.  
 
This report identifies 15 states, the federal government and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) with some form of 
campaign contribution limits on contracto rs. Several other jurisdictions have disclosure -only 
require ments on gove rnment contractors and dozens  of muni cipalities also have such restrictions.  
 
The laws vary widely in effectiveness and scope. The strongest pa y-to-play laws will have 
several key elements, including : (i) a broad definition of contractors subject to the restrictions to 
include senior executive personnel; (ii) special disclosure requirements so that compliance can be 
easily monitored; (iii) forfei ture of the contract and future contract business for serious 
violations; and (iv) a cure provision  to clean up inadvertent  mistakes.  
 
This report de scribes the federal and state pay -to-play laws. In a separate report, Public Citizen 
documents th e scandals  that have given rise to these laws, which is available at:
