Good
morning
Senator
Bailey,
Representative
Perry
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
Coverage,
Insurance,
and
Financial
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
policy
analyst
for
Maine
Policy
Institute,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1541
and
LD
1554.
Certificate
of
Need
(CON),
first
enacted
in
Maine
in
1978,
requires
health
care
entities
to
obtain
government
approval—and
navigate
a
lengthy
and
expensive
process
of
bureaucratic
review—before
making
large
expenditures
to
expand
services,
build
new
facilities,
or
purchase
additional
equipment.
These
laws,
which
have
been
rejected
by
the
federal
government
and
15
other
states,
limit
competition
in
the
health
care
system
and
drive
up
costs
by
restricting
the
supply
of
available
care.
A
2013
Maine
Policy
Institute
analysis
compared
the
10
states
with
the
fewest
hospital
beds
per
1,000
residents
to
the
10
states
with
the
most
and
found
expenses
per
inpatient
day
are
$878
more
in
states
with
fewer
hospital
beds.

Some
proponents
argue
that
CON
is
necessary
in
order
to
constrain
the
growth
in
prices
that
health
providers
might
charge
for
various
services.
The
fact
is,
if
hospitals
thought
increasing
prices
for
any
reason
would
make
them
more
money,
they
would
do
it—with
or
without
a
CON.
They
don’t
need
to
build
out
extra
beds,
offer
more
services,
or
buy
more
expensive
equipment
in
order
to
rationalize
it.
The
Certificate
of
Need
process
allows
established
providers
to
hide
behind
this
faulty
logic
and
use
state
regulation
to
protect
their
position
in
the
industry.
It
restricts
competition,
capacity,
and
ultimately,
health
care
options
for
consumers.
The
Federal
Trade
Commission
and
the
Antitrust
Division
of
The
Department
of
Justice
agreed
in
a
2016
statement,
noting
that
“CON
laws
raise
considerable

competitive
concerns
and
generally
do
not
appear
to

their

benefits
for
health

consumers.”

A
study
by
the
Mercatus
Center
published
July
2020
showed
that
CON
reform
leads
to
more
satisfaction
and
access
to
care,
especially
in
rural
areas.
Researchers
found,
both
before
and
after
controlling
for
social
risk
factors
such
as
race,
education,
and
poverty
status,
that
in
counties
with
CON
laws,
“healthcare
expenses
per
Medicare
beneficiary
are
higher,
as
are
utilization
rates
of
ambulance
services,
emergency
departments,
and
readmissions.”

In
2016,
Mercatus
Center
researchers
also
found
that
hospitals
in
non-CON
states
have
significantly
lower
mortality
rates
for
pneumonia,
heart
failure,
and
heart
attack.
These
hospitals
also
have
lower
readmission
rates
for
heart
failure
and
heart
attack,
plus
their
patients
are
more
likely
to
report
a
pleasant
hospital
experience.

A
study
published
in
the
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
during
the
1980s,
when
many
more
states
had
CON
laws
than
today,
noted
that
hospitals
in
states
with
the
most
stringent
CON
review
procedures
had
significantly
higher
mortality
rates,
ranging
from
6%
to
10%
higher.

During
the
15-month
state
of
emergency,
Governor
Mills
allowed
the
Division
of
Licensing
(DLC)
to
implement
an
expedited
CON
process.
According
to
a
manager
at
DLC,
this
allowed
11
applications
to
sail
through
the
office,
each
within
a
week,
instead
of
the
usual
3-4
months.
When
public
health
and
care
capacity
is
front
of
mind
in
healthcare
regulation,
we
inherently
understand
that
clearing
away
these
unnecessary
barriers
is
the
most
prudent
choice.
Inertia
is
a
strong
force
in
public
policy,
but
we
must
not
let
it
get
in
the
way
of
common
sense
reform.
The
status
quo
should
never
hold
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
If
a
policy
does
not
serve
its
intended
purpose—or
if
it
does,
but
its
effects
are
counterproductive
to
its
stated
goals—it
must
be
repealed.

Please
deem
LD
1541
and
LD
1554
"Ought

Pass"
and
finally
scrap
this
outdated
and
anti-competitive
law
which
only
serves
to
restrict
the
supply
of
care.
Thank
you
for
your

and
consideration.
