Joint Select Committee on Housing  
Testimony of Laura Mitchell, Executive Director of the M aine Affordable Housing Coalition on April 14, 2023  
in favor of LD226 An Act to Address Maine's Affordable Housing Crisis    
 
Good a�ernoon, Senator Pierce, Representa�ve Gere, and members of the Joint Select Commitee on Housing. My 
name is Tyler Norod , I serve as the Development Director of Westbrook Development Corpora�on , a nonproﬁt 
organiza�on which op erates as the development arm of the Westbrook Housing Authority .  
Thank  you for this opportunity to speak in favor of LD 226.  Maine is experiencing a housing crisis unlike anything it 
has ever seen  before.  At its core it is a supply and demand issue.  For dec ades our zoning and funding strategies 
have been disconnected from the reality of everyday Mainer ’s needs  leading to a severe housing shortage .  This h as 
now b led into being an is sue fo r most Maine rs across the income spectrum and the only real solu�on is to build.   
Maine is the oldest state in the Union.  With the baby boomers set to re� re some stud ies have es�mated we will 
need to atract 5,000 new work ers each y ear to keep the econom y ﬂowing.  Yet, the biggest hurdle atrac�ng  and 
maintaining our workforce is the availability of housing.  At the same �me, we are seeing an in crease in remote 
workers , short term rent als, and second home purchases who direc tly comp ete for housing with those who  live and 
work locally .  In short, the problem is ge�ng worse , not beter and we need bold and decisive ac�on to stabilize 
the housing market to ensure Maine remains a vibrant and prosperous state for genera�ons to come . 
A recent study found that it would take the typical American worker 11 years of saving to save up a 5% 
downpayment on a home  and 30 years to save 20% .  When combined with inﬂated housing pr ices and qui ckly 
rising rates, many households who tradi �onally may have become home owners are thus stuck in the rental market.  
This only exacerbates  the already dire housing shortage faced by our workforce who earn less than the median 
income.   
LD 226 will signiﬁcantly relieve pressure in the marketplace and provide stability to our workforce.  This is not just a 
housing  bill, but in eﬀect , an economic development bill.  Compared to other op�ons for th ese funds , investment 
in housing pays long term reoccurring divi dends.  The  projects that we build are self suﬃ cient a�er development.  
Not only do we supply housing  at an aﬀor dable price  for our workforc e, but housing stability can mi�gate other 
tangen�al  public costs by stabilizing families and seniors  so that they are less de pendent on other types of public 
support.   Stabilizing housing for our workforce allows children to remain in their s chool districts without the 
constant disrup�on of moving around;  Stabilizing housing allows s eniors to stay in their comm uni�es near family 
and friends ; and stabilizing housing provide certainty for employers that their workforce can st ay local and grow.  

The housing crisis touches all facets of life and work in Maine.  At its core, the  problem is a lack of supply and the 
solu�on is simple : We need to build more  housing  as quickly as we can.  The only way to do that is with a 
signiﬁcant investment in funding.  
I am tes�fying today in favor of LD 226 and urge you to support this c ri�cal bill.  All people in Maine deserve a place 
to call home.  Thank you  for your �me and considera�on.
