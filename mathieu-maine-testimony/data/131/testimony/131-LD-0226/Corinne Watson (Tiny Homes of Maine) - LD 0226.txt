Written Testimony of Corinne Watson 
 
In Support of 
 
LD 226: An Act to Address Maine’s Affordable 
Housing Crisis 
 
Corinne Watson, Tiny Home Advocate, Tiny Homes of Maine 
 
Before the Joint Select Committee on Housing 
 
April 14, 2023 
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and Honorable members of the Housing Committee, 
My name is Corinne Watson, founder and CEO of Tiny Homes of Maine. I am here in strong 
support of LD 226, “An Act to Address Maine’s Affordable Housing Crisis”.  
Like most communities in Maine, Aroostook County is struggling with housing people due to the 
cost of rent and home price at this time.  Something needs to be done to help people have warm 
safe places to sleep at night.   
At this time, I am urging this committee to support a solution that allows more affordable 
housing options. 
Thank you very much for your time. 
Corinne Watson,
