Good
morning
Senat or
Pier ce,
Repr esentativ e
Ger e,
and
honor able
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman,
I’ m
a
r esident
of
Lewist on,
and
I
am
testifying
t oda y
in
suppor t
of
LD
226,
“ An
Act
t o
Addr ess
Maine ' s
Affor dable
Housing
Crisis. ”
All
acr oss
the
state
of
Maine
people
ar e
struggling
t o
affor d
a
place
t o
liv e.
Our
hist oric
lack
of
inv estment
in
affor dable
housing
(and
housing
in
gener al)
has
cr eated
a
situation
wher e
we
simply
do
not
ha v e
enough
housing
units
t o
meet
demand.
This,
in
turn,
leads
t o
huge
spik es
in
cost
for
both
r enters
and
home
buy ers.
F or
example,
my
home
in
downt own
Lewist on
has
mor e
than
doubled
in
v alue
since
I
was
for tunate
enough
t o
pur chase
it
just
o v er
ﬁv e
y ears
ago.
I’v e
also
seen
r ents
in
my
neighborhood
go
up
b y
50%
or
mor e
in
the
same
time
period.
Many
people
ar e
spending
one
thir d,
one
half
or
e v en
mor e
of
their
income
just
on
a
place
t o
liv e.
A
saf e
and
affor dable
home
pr o vides
the
stability
that
allows
e v er ything
else
in
our
liv es
t o
happen:
adults
holding
down
a
job,
childr en
succeeding
in
schools,
seniors
enjo ying
their
r etir ement,
and
people
of
all
ages
maintaining
their
health
and
wellbeing.
Besides
the
fact
that
e v er y
Mainer
deser v es
an
affor dable
place
t o
liv e,
this
issue
also
has
economic
implications.
As
our
population
ages
out
of
the
workfor ce
we
need
t o
attr act
and
r etain
y ounger
people
if
we
want
t o
maintain
the
le v el
of
ser vices
that
we
ar e
used
t o.
If
people
cannot
affor d
t o
liv e
her e
then
we
will
all
lose
out
on
the
beneﬁts
that
a
pr oductiv e,
talented
workfor ce
pr o vides.
Maine
can
help
ﬁx
this
pr oblem
b y
building
as
many
affor dable
housing
units
as
we
can
o v er
the
next
se v er al
y ears,
a
task
which
would
be
helped
immensely
b y
the
funding
that
this
bill
pr o vides.
Please
help
addr ess
our
housing
crisis
b y
v oting
Ought
T o
P ass

LD
226.
Thank

time
and
