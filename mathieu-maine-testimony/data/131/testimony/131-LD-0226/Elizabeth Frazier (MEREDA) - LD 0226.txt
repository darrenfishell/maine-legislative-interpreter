LD 226, An Act to Address Maine’s Affordable Housing Crisis 
April 14, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Honorable Members of the Joint Select Committee on 
Housing;  
On behalf of the Maine Real Estate and Development Association (MEREDA), I am testifying in support 
of LD 226, An Act to Address Maine’s Affordable Housing Crisis.  
MEREDA is Maine’s premiere trade association representing commercial real estate and the state’s 
housing creators. MEREDA members are housing creators, engineers, architects, designers, bankers, 
lawyers, brokers, and many other organizations involved in the real estate industry. MEREDA’s guiding 
principle is the promotion of responsible real estate development – responsible real estate development 
is community development. Through the advocacy efforts of its Public Policy Committee, MEREDA works 
to advance a more fair, practical, and predictable policy landscape for housing creation in Maine.  
MEREDA supports LD 226 because it represents a beginning – we strongly believe that something more 
in the neighborhood of $500 million would be necessary to fully address Maine’s housing crisis in a way 
that provides the long-term stability and safe, quality housing that our Mainers deserve.  
MEREDA will support the passage of LD 226 off the Special Appropriations Table if the Housing 
Committee sees fit to recommend the bill and the legislature supports its passage.  
Sincerely 
Elizabeth M. Frazier 
On behalf of Maine Real Estate & Development Association
