207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 226 An Act to 
Address Maine's Affordable Housing Crisis 
April 14, 2023 , 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Special Committee 
on Housing, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership and we support LD 226 An Act to Address 
Maine's Affordable Housing Crisis. 
In a recent Children's Caucus in the Statehouse, the recently retired CEO 
said that one of the most important factors that are keeping businesses 
from returning to pre-pandemic production levels is the lack of affordable 
housing, throughout the entire state. Rents are going up in every town 
and city, and too many of the people we depend on — teachers, police, 
plumbers - are being squeezed out. 
Compounding the problem in Maine is simply that we do not have enough 
housing built and move in ready for all who need it, let alone housing 
speciﬁcally for working people and families. The $200 million proposed in 
LD 226 to increase the supply of affordable housing throughout the state 
is an important step in making a difference. We have public and private 
companies and community action agencies that want to build more 
affordable housing, but building new developments is costly and when 
you are also assuming lower rents, the math doesn't always look good. 
Maine’s Community Action Agencies currently own andlor operate over 
800 affordable housing units, in addition to housing for speciﬁc 
populations who are older or have specific diagnoses; and we have 200 
new units coming online within the next year or so. We are poised to 
either lead or partner with builders to create affordable housing that has 
supports that lead to economic mobility, including early childhood 
education, workforce development and continuing education. 
Funding rural programs in addition to our smaller and larger cities is 
imperative. The LIHTC program is good for Maine, but as a very rural 
state its rules and scoring mean rural development is harder to fund. ln 
Waldo County, for example, the local community action agency has land 
ready to develop for their ofﬁce and workforce housing, something much 
needed and very hard to find in the greater Belfast area. The Rural Rental 
Program makes financing that development much more likely, and there 
are many more rural areas that could follow that lead. 
Thank you for your time and attention, l am happy to try to answer any 
questions you have.
