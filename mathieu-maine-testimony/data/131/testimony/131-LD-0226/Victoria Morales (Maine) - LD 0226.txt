Dear
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Joint
Select
Committee
Housing:
Quality
Housing
Coalition
(QHC)
carries
out
its
mission
to
create
and
support
quality
housing
opportunities
for
those
in
need
through
Project
HOME
programming
and
the
Maine
Housing
Equity
Project.
Since
2018,
Project
HOME
has
provided
over
550
households,
over
1265
adults
and
children
who
have
experienced
homelessness
and
housing
insecurity ,
with
permanent
housing
with
a
99%
success
rate.
In
2022,
we
provided
250
units
of
housing
to
Project
HOME
households
with
our
landlord
partners
in
5
counties.
In
the
Low
Income
Housing
T ax
Credit
world,
that
amounts
to
the
construction
of
five
af fordable
housing
developments
in
just
one
year .
The
Maine
Housing
Equity
Project
educates
our
communities
about
the
existing
systemic
barriers
to
creating
and
supporting
quality
housing
opportunities
for
those
in
need
and
works
closely
with
community
partners
on
proven
solutions
at
the
local
and
state
level
in
the
areas
of
housing
supply ,
zoning
reform,
preservation
of
naturally
occurring
af fordable
housing,
and
housing
stability
policies.
Maine’ s
Housing
Crisis
Landscape:
Renters:
●
According
to
MaineHousing’ s
Af fordability
Indices,
out
of
the
total
163,185
renter
households,
55%,
89,820
households,
were
unable
to
af ford
a
median
priced
two
bedroom
at
$956/month
in
Maine.
89,820
housing
insecure
households
is
15%
of
total
Maine
households.

(2020
data)
●
According
to
MaineHousing’ s
2023
Outlook
Report,
“rental
home
costs
are
expected
to
continue
to
rise
in
2023,
compounded
by
both
inflationary
pressures
on
landlords
and
property
managers
and
a
private
and
public
housing
development
pipeline
that
is
being
dramatically
constricted
by
workforce
shortages
and
supply
chain
troubles.”

According

analyzing

a
small
amount
of
rent
in
the
range
of
$1,235.

Older
Adults

“The
median
income
for
Maine
women
age
65+
who
live
alone
is
$22,059,
compared
to 
$27,008
for
men.
†
Ther efor e,
it
is
likely
that
half
of
older
Maine
women
who
live 
alone
would
have
difficulty
covering
their
basic
needs
for
food,
housing, 
transportation,
healthcare,
and
other
miscellaneous
expenditures,
especially
if
they
were 
in
less
than
excellent
health
or
did
not
own
their
own
home.
There
are
over
twice
as
many 
women

who
live

(50,000)
compared
to
men
(23,400).”

Employment
Needs 
According
to
Amanda
Rector ,
Maine’ s
Economist,
by
2030,
Maine
must
attract
75,000 
new
employees
to
meet
its
goal
to
“be
an
international
leader
with
a
vibrant,
sustainable, 
environmentally-
responsible
economy .
All
across
the
state,
the
people
of
Maine
will 
have
access
to
an
unmatched
quality
of
life
and
good
paying
jobs.”

Funding
is
a
Critical
Component
to
Solving
Maine’ s
Housing
Crisis
The
most
important
economic
indicator
that
is
often
overlooked
is
the
percentage
of
the
population
without
stable
and
af fordable
homes.
W ithout
a
stable
and
affordable
home,
employees,
students,
and
entr epr eneurs
cannot
achieve
their
potential.
And,
the
repercussions
of
having
unstable
and
unaf fordable
housing
is
crushing
debt,
eviction,
homelessness,
and
mental
and
health
care
crisis,
which
are
all
devastating
for
individuals
and
children,
and
extremely
expensive
for
taxpayers
for
emer gency
rooms,
shelters,
and
jails
at
the
deepest
end
of
this
crisis.
The
dire
housing
situation
facing
Maine
people,
employers,
and
tax
payers
for
the
next
10-20
years
cannot
be
understated.
One
critical
solution
is
allocating
$100,000
each
year
of
the
131st
Legislature
for
af fordable
housing
pursuant
to
LD
226.
This
kind
of
investment
makes
clear
that
Maine
understands
the
gravity
of
this
crisis,
including
the
devastating
impact
continuing
this
crisis
will
have
on
our
economy
and
the
health
of
our
residents.
LD
226
also
makes
clear
that
Maine
intends
to
invest
in
the
most
ef fective
strategies
that
create
af fordability ,
including
preserving
af fordability
within
existing
housing
stock,
providing
rental
assistance
to
prevent
evictions,
and
building
new
af fordable
units.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
this
testimony .
