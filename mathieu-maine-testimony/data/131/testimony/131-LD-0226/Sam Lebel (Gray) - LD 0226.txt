A productive economy and healthy society needs quality, affordable housing as its 
foundation. We are facing a housing crisis for a variety of reasons - now is the time to
leverage additional funds and resources to address this very real issue. Maine's 
development community is ready to get to work building new housing. Please support
this bill which represents the ultimate investment in the people and economy of 
Maine.
