Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing
Committee on Health and Human Services:
My name is Jill Johanning from Alpha One Disability and Aging Solutions, Maine's 
Center for Independent Living, and I am writing on support of behalf of LD 1339, 
"Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on 
Disabilities". 
 
As the Maine Affiliate of the New England ADA Center, Alpha One provides public 
awareness and technical assistance for federal accessibility laws. I have personally 
spent a decade learning from other New England affiliates how they provide 
accessibility services and support to their communities that are different from Maine.  
While Maine has a strong Office of Aging and Disabilities Services for individuals 
with disabilities, a single ADA Coordinator position for State Government, and a 
single ADA Coordinator position for the Maine Department of Transportation, there 
are limited resources for our municipalities to understand their obligations, and 
residents to understand their rights with multi-family housing and public 
accommodations under federal and state laws. It is hard for people with disabilities to 
live independently in Maine when the built environments and existing policies create 
barriers to be equally engaged in our communities and for seeking quality 
employment.
 
While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has been law for over 30 years, 
many communities, organizations, and private businesses rely on the State Fire 
Marshal and local code enforcement officers for accessibility matters even though 
many aspects of the civil rights and human rights laws are not life safety and building 
related, and there are no code enforcement requirements for accessibility training.  
And as technology continues to advance with new opportunities, there are more 
opportunities for programs and services in Maine from not being inclusive and 
unintentionally discriminating. Better communication and cooperation between 
existing organizations and efforts in Maine could greatly increase the integration of 
good planning for all aspects of life in Maine.
 
I look forward to the success of the Resolve to identify the need in Maine and how it 
would be best for the state to integrate the intent of the civil rights law into regular 
operation of Maineâ€™s communities.
