Re:  LD 1339   Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on 
Disabilities  
 
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human  Services:  
 
This letter provides information regarding LD 1339   Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study 
Forming the Maine Commission on Disabilities .  The Department of Labor  is neither for nor against 
this bill.  This resolve establishes a task forc e to study the formation of a statewide commission on 
disabilities and the consolidation of services for persons with or at risk for disabilities.  The task force must 
submit a report no later than December 6, 2023, including suggested legislation to be in troduced in the 
Second Regular Session of the 131st Legislature.  The Task Force is to be staffed by the Legislative Council.  
 
As part of the Bureau of Rehabilitation Service s at the Maine Department of Labor  (MDOL) , the Office of 
the State Accessibility Coordinator leads the State’s compliance under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA).  The ADA Coordinator works with State agencies to develop and carryout policies and practices 
regarding services, fa cilities, web de sign, and communication.  There are ADA coordinators assigned 
within each  state agency and the State ADA Coordinator works with constituents and departments to reso lve 
any disability -based discrimination complaints.   MDOL also maintains an ADA webpage  that offers 
information and resources to the public reg arding civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities.   
 
Disability touches everyone  and hence the need  for supportive state agency services  is varied and extensive  
for Maine residents at some point s during their lifetime .  This is clearly evident  in the wide breadth of LD 
1339  with its charge to the identifi ed task force members to determine what services are currently provided 
by state agencies and how those servic es can be combined for greater effectiveness and access.    This would 
be a huge undertaking as d isability is unique to each individual  and state services need to be accordingly 
responsive  and inclusive rather than separated and consolidated under a broad disability umbrella.   Already 
in exis tence are many councils and commissions which  ensure that people with disabilities have equal 
access and receive services  mandated by federal and/or state law.  Examples of these include t he 
Commission on Disability and Employ ment; the Division for the Blind’s State Rehabilitation Council ; the 
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation’s State Rehabilitation Council; the State Independent Living Council ; 
the Commission for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Late Deafened;  and the Developmental Disabilities 
Council .   
 
 
 We agree that the State has a significant role in supporting inclusive programs that help people with 
disabilities be we ll and active in their communities  but have concerns that the establishment of a 
commission such as proposed in the bill risks being duplicative and adding a layer of unnecessary oversight .  
We also are concerned that participation in the task force would divert state staff resources  from other work  
and ensuring that state agency services are delivered in an inclusive and effective manner  to Mainers  with 
disabilities.   
 
Thank you for the consi deration of this information.  Please feel free to contact Karen Fraser, who is the 
director of MDOL’s Bureau of Rehabilitation Services , if we can be of further assistance as you consider 
LD 1339  Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on Disabilities .
