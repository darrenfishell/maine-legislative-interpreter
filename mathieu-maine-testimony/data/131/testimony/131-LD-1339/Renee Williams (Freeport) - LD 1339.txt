The
American
with
Disabilities
act
was
signed
into
federal
law
in
1990.
1
in
4
Americans
and
Mainers
have
a
disability.
Compliance
and
enforcement
are
very
limited
in
Maine.
As
a
family
we
have
very
limited
options
when
it
comes
to
recreation
indoors
or
outside,
accommodations
at
campgrounds,
hotels,
motels,
bed
and
breakfasts,
eateries,
shopping
and
sadly
in
healthcare
In
March
my
husband
was
scheduled
for
a
procedure
at
Maine
Medical
Center.
He
voiced
the
need
for
an
ADA
room
at
the
pre-registration
phone
call.
Upon
arrival
on
the
unit
we
were
told
there
was
no
ADA
room
available
for
him.
This
was
not
because
either
ADA
room
was
occupied
with
other
disabled
folks,
but
because
of
a
lack
of
planning,
lack
of
education
and
just
plain
old
ignorance.
One
of
the
nurses
told
us
“All
the
bathrooms
have
grab
bars”
in
response
to
my
concern
about
a
non
ADA
room.
I
had
to
inform
her
that
having
grab
bars
for
the
toilet
in
a
room
too
small
to
use
or
enter
by
someone
in
a
wheelchair
is
useless.
Her
response
was
that
she
never
thought
about
the
size
of
the
bathrooms.
It
is
important
to
note
that
only
five
years
prior
in
2018,
we
had
the
exact
same
experience
on
the
same
unit.
That
day
we
were
the
first
patient
at
7am
on
the
unit
and
still
were
not
given
either
of
the
ADA
rooms.
Sadly
this
is
a
very
common
event
in
my
husband’s
life
when
seeking
healthcare.
Often
offices
are
far
too
small
to
allow
him
to
move
properly
in
an
exam
room.
Often
parking
is
not
ADA
compliant
keeping
him
from
having
the
space
he
needs
to
enter
and
exit
his
vehicle.
Counters
are
too
high
at
nearly
every
place
you
can
think
of
including
banks,
grocery
stores,
hotels,
retail
stores
and
medical
offices.
The
barriers
for
the
disabled
to
live
equally
as
able
bodied
Mainers
are
too
many
to
count.
Our
oldest
daughter
has
played
field
hockey
in
both
high
school
and
college
for
the
University
of
Maine
at
Farmington.
UMF
does
not
have
any
ADA
compliance
at
its
outdoor
athletic
facilities.
We
have
worked
hard
with
two
Athletic
Directors
to
address
this
issue
and
only
in
her
last
season
did
access
improve,
but
not
to
the
level
of
actual
compliance
with
the
law.
This
is
also
true
at
other
college
and
high
school
fields
including
Cape
Elizabeth
High
School,
Gray-New
Gloucester
High
School,
Brunswick
HIgh
School,
Thomas
College,
Husson
University ,
Colby
College,
University
of
Southern
Maine
and
others.
These
problems
include
access
to
the
fields,
access
to
restrooms
and
in
some
cases
no
ADA
parking
at
all(Thomas
College
and
Husson
University).
This
year
I
finally
got
some
response
to
my
complaints
to
these
institutions,
but
I
am
one
woman
and
can
only
do
so
much.

On
March
25th,
we
went
to
University
of
Maine
for
an
accepted
student
day
with
our
youngest.
The
problems
with
access
were
frankly
ridiculous
and
included
over
20
ADA
parking
spaces
with
no
signs,
or
ground
markings,
crumbled
pavement
at
curb
cut
outs
and
sidewalks,
broken
cement
on
an
access
ramp
to
the
Memorial
Union
and
crumbling
bricks
on
the
courtyard
which
were
the
equivalent
of
an
obstacle
course
to
reach
the
door
to
enter
the
building.
Additionally ,
there
were
no
clear
indicators
inside
the
Collins
Center
for
the
Arts
to
find
elevators
or
which
doors
would
lead
to
ADA
seating
in
the
theater.
Again
I
have
emailed
multiple
folks
at
the
University
of
Maine
and
there
seems
to
be
some
effort
to
respond,
but
again
I
am
only
one
woman
with
a
big
agenda.
Other
barriers
over
the
years
have
included
my
husband
having
access
to
his
van
blocked
by
people
parking
right
up
against
his
van
in
marked
access
aisles
and
also
when
various
facilities
including
Sebago
Lake
State
Park
fail
to
upkeep
the
painting
on
the
ground
for
ADA
spaces.
We
have
many
times
“bumped”
my
husband
over
steps
into
various
restaurants
or
stores
all
over
the
state,
been
unable
to
access
common
recreation
facilities
at
State
Parks,
town
owned
properties
such
as
Winslow
Park
in
Freeport
and
various
boat
ramps.
In
the
town
of
Freeport
new
soccer
fields
were
constructed
on
Hunter
Road
in
2012.
This
facility
does
not
have
accessible
restrooms
as
there
is
no
ramp,
the
toilets
were
not
ADA
height,
there
is
tall
grass
that
must
be
pushed
across
and
several
of
the
fields
can
not
be
reached
by
anyone
with
a
mobile
disability
or
sight
impairment
due
to
the
need
to
cross
a
drainage
gully.
How
does
this
happen
at
a
relatively
new
facility?
This
happens
all
over
Maine
because
most
who
work
in
code
enforcement
do
not
know
the
ADA
and
allow
for
violations
to
take
place.
The
former
code
enforcement
officer
in
Freeport
allowed
Linda
Bean
to
remove
an
elevator
in
the
building
she
converted
into
a
restaurant.
His
reasoning
was
“the
same
menu
is
offered
on
both
floors”
,
somehow
indicating
that
because
the
food
was
the
same,
it
was
ok
to
deny
access
to
the
second
floor
balcony
for
disabled
guests.
The
violations
we
have
seen
in
Brunswick,
Topsham,
Augusta,
Freeport,
Boothbay,
Bar
Harbor,
Lewiston,
Bangor
and
every
town
in
between
are
too
numerous
to
list
here.
Having
a
State
Commission
on
Disability
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
to
begin
to
address
how
to
improve
knowledge,
compliance
and
enforcement
of
the
ADA
in
Maine.
I
strongly
encourage
this
committee
to
endorse
LD
1339.
Sincerely,
Renee
D
Williams,
Freeport,
