LD 1339 Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on Disabilities 
 
My name is Diane Boas and I am the parent of an adult with an intellectual disability, chronic health 
issues and a mental health diagnosis. He lives in a group home where he receives the level of support 
and oversight he requires considering his very complex medical and behavioral profile.  
 
I am in support of LD 1339 BUT ask that it be amended to include a representative from the Maine 
Developmental Services Oversight Advisory Board (MDSOAB), an organization that represents the 
full spectrum of people with disabilities including those with the highest level of need such as my son. 
 
In reviewing the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on Disabilities, itâ€™s reassuring 
to see that a self-advocate will be a member. I wish nothing more than for my son to advocate for 
himself, but given the complexity of his needs, he has been unable to do so. He is one of hundreds of 
individuals with I/DD with higher needs, who rely on family members to speak for them and alongside 
them. Families like ours have advocated for our sons and daughters throughout their lives and know 
them best. 
 
I urge you to add a representative from Maine Developmental Services Oversight Advisory Board 
(MDSOAB) to the task force to ensure that individuals with higher needs are seen and heard. 
 
Thank you, 
 
Diane D. Boas
