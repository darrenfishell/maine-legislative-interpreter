Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Support of 
LD 1339, Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to Study Forming the Maine Commission on 
Disabilities 
April 18, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee. My name is Kate Dufour, and I am submitting testimony in support of LD 1339 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders elected by their peers to serve on the Association ’s Legislative 
Policy Committee and directed to establish positions on bills of municipal interest. 
Simply put, municipal ofﬁcials support the collaborative, rather than mandatory, 
approach advanced in LD 1339, appreciate being included in the study, and look forward to 
working with the sponsor to ensure that services provided at the municipal level are easily 
accessible to all residents. 
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue. If you have any 
questions about the Association ’s position on this bill, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
kdufourgalmemun.org or 1-800-452-8786.
