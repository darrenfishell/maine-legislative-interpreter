TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1002  
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE A LUNCH PERIOD OF AT LEAST 30 MINUTES FOR  
STUDENTS AND REDUCE FOOD WAS TE 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.  I 
am Steven Baile y, executive director  of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association , in opposition to  L.D. 1002 . 
 
A survey conducted by MS SA on  the length of lunch periods showed that on average students have between 
20 and 25 minutes for lunch each day. When asked what the challenges would be to a mandated lunch period , 
they shared the following responses:  
 
Space :  Many of our schools do no t hav e a designated cafeteria. Many “ lunchrooms ” are also used for 
physical education, chorus, band , and drama classes. Extending the lunch period would decrease time for 
these other important curricu lar activities.  
 
Loss of Instructional Time: Accommodati ng se veral 30-minute  lunch period s would result in the loss of 
instructional time.  
 
Staffing Concerns:  Some reported that due to contractual agreements  a 30-minute lunch period  would be 
impossible to  support  unless more staff was hired.  
 
Time:  Some districts reported that they would have to start serving lunch at 9:45 in the morning to 
accommodate the 30-minute  requirement in order to feed all of their students.
