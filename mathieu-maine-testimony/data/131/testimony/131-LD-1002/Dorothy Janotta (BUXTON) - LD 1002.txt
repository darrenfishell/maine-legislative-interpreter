Testimony for LD 1002 An Act to Require a Lunch Period of at Least 30 Minutes for Students and 
Reduce Food Waste 
This is my 30th year in School Nutrition.  There have been many changes to improve programs 
over this time.  The one thing that remains evident is that students do not have enough time to 
eat the nutritious foods that we are offering every day.   
In the past 2 years, we have seen an increase in our participation of meals which we celebrate 
as School Nutrition Professionals every day!  With the increased participation, our student meal 
lines have been larger and the wait time a bit longer.  By the time some of the students receive 
their lunch tray, it is almost time for dismissal from the cafeteria.  It is very sad to see students 
trying to fit in the last bite on their way to the recycle bins to empty their trays.  Many delicious 
fruits and vegetables along with labor intense main entrees are found in the food waste bins. 
For some students, this may be their only nutritious meal of the day and our crew are 
concerned about the students and also the food waste. 
LD 1002 would make a difference in the lives of our students as well as the amount of food 
waste lining the recycle bins. 
Thank you,
