In
support
of
LD1002
:
An
Act
to
Require
a
Lunch
Period
of
at
Least
30

for

and
Reduce
Food
W aste
Thank
you,
Senator
Raf ferty
and
Representative
Brennen
and
honorable
members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee
.
My
name
is
Angie
T ehuitzil,
I
live
in
Farmington,
Maine,
and
I
work
at
Maine
Y outh
Power
as
a
legislative
fellow .
I
am
here
today
to
ask
that
you
support
LD1002:
An
Act
to
Require
a
Lunch
Period
of
at
Least
30
Minutes
for
Students
and
Reduce
Food
W aste.
I
am
an
older
sister
of
two
siblings
(10
and
14
years
old).
I
care
that
my
siblings
get
enough
time
to
eat
lunch,
especially
after
being
in
class
for
4-6
hours
until
their
lunch
break
and
having
sports
practice
right
after
school.
All
students
need
adequate
time
to
fully
nourish
their
bodies
after
their
long
day
of
classes
and
properly
fuel
for
their
sports.
While
Maine
states
that
the
average
lunch
period
is
20
minutes,
this
excludes
the
time
it
takes
to
wash
their
hands,
go
to
the
lunchroom,
wait
in
line,
and
go
through
the
line,
hence
cutting
of f
students'
lunch
almost
5-10
minutes
from
those
20
minutes.
Extending
the
time
will
also
allow
students
to
reduce
food
waste.
School
meals
are
essential
to
acquire
balanced
nutrition
and
most
of
the
food
wasted
is
fresh
produced.
Having
enough
time
to
eat
is
especially
important
for
the
43%
of
children
who
highly
rely
on
school
lunch
because
it
is
their
only
complete
meal
throughout
the
day .
This
bill
will
help
ensure
that
children
no
longer
go
hungry .
If
children's
education
is
deprived
due
to
issues
with
school
meals,
we
must
give
children
enough
time
to
enjoy
and
properly
eat
before
they
go
to
class.
After
all,
hungry
students
can
not
learn
and
focus
in
class;
hungry
kids
can't
perform
well
in
their
field.
I,
therefore,
encourage
the
committee
to
support
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
