Our children need to eat their food in order to be present and participate in class. Not 
giving them enough time to eat the food seems absurd. My daughter is in 
Kindergarten and routinely comes home super hungry because she says she was 
rushed at lunch and wasn't able to eat everything she wanted to.
Let's allow our children the time to nourish themselves so they can be at their best. 
We rush around so much these days - let's not force this upon our kids. They are 
children - let's give them time to eat.
