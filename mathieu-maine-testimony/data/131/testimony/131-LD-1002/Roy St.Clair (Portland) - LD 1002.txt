Please consider adopting a rule to mandate at least 30 minutes for school lunch 
period. My grandchildren have explained to me that they never have enough time to 
eat their lunch. It is important for kids to have adequate time to finish and eating and 
enjoy a few minutes of "non-class-time" with their friends. A short lunch period of 
less than 30 minutes also creates food waste and unhealthy eating habits. This is a 
simple, easy fix that will make children's lives a little bit better.
