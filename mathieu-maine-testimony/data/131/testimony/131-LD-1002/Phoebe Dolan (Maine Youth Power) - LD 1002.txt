Chair
Raf ferty
and
Chair
Brennen,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural 
Af fairs
Committee,
My
name
is
Phoebe
Dolan,
I
live
in
Swanville,
Maine
and
I
am
a
co-director
of
Maine
Y outh 
Power ,
a
youth-led,
youth
movement
throughout
rural
and
suburban
Maine
fighting
to
win 
human
dignity ,
equity
and
a
livable
future
for
all.
I
am
here
today
to
ask
that
you
support 
Representative
Dodge’ s
bill
LD
1002
An
Act
to
Require
a
Lunch
Period
of
at
Least
30
Minutes 
for
Students
and
Reduce
Food
W aste.
As
a
rural
youth
activist
and
community
or ganizer
in
Maine
alone,
I
have
spoken
with
a
lot
of 
students
who
spend
each
day
attending
Maine’ s
public
school
system.
Children
in
their
early 
years
all
the
way
through
high
school
are
responsible
for
attending
school
and
are
trusting
that 
the
school
will
care
for
their
needs.
Eating
and
having
space
to
go
outside
and
play
or
at
least 
breathe
fresh
air
is
a
right.
Many
young
people
I
have
spoken
to
this
past
year ,
before 
representative
Dodge’ s
bill
was
brought
to
my
attention,
shared
with
me
that
the
first
thing
they 
wanted
changed
about
the
school
day
was
a
longer
lunch
-
an
hour
being
the
optimal
time.
Children
are
in
school
from
7:45
am
or
8am
until
2:30
or
3pm
and
then
they
often
play
sports,
or 
participate
in
afterschool
activities
until.
That
is
a
long
day
if
you
do
not
have
time
to
properly 
eat
your
lunch
around
the
middle
of
the
day .
If
you
wait
in
the
lunch
line
for
10
or
15
minutes 
and
lunch
is
only
20
minutes
long,
then
you
are
left
with
a
sliver
of
time
left.
I
am
sharing
with
you
the
stories
I
have
heard,
and
as
a
child
who
went
to
school
in
Maine,
it
is 
essential
to
secure
all
the
children’ s
right
to
a
30
minute
lunch
break.
Support
LD1002:
An
Act
to 
Require
a
Lunch
Period
of
at
Least
30
Minutes
for
Students
and
Reduce
Food
W aste,
which
will 
support
the
next
generation
of
politicians
in
our
state.
Thank
you
for
your
time, 
Phoebe
Dolan
