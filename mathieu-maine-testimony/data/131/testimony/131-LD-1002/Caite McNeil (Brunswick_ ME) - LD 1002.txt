I am so proud to live in a state that is committed to the health and well-being of its children. 
How lucky we are that our kids have free, unfettered access to nutritious meals each day at 
school! In order to ensure that students can actually take advantage of these resources, it is 
imperative that they have enough time to sit, visit with friends, take a break from the rigour of 
the day and enjoy their food. Our school nutrition directors and cooks and servers do such 
important work making nutritious and locally sourced meals for our children. Let's be sure that
there is enough time built into the school day for our children to benefit from it.
Thanks for all you do.
