Testimony of Anna Korsen, Full Plates Full Potential 
In Support of LD 1002 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs. My name is Anna Korsen, Advocacy and Implementation Director with Full Plates Full Potential, a statewide 
non-profit working to address childhood food insecurity by providing technical and financial assistance to schools and 
communities to help feed kids now, while advocating for the systemic changes necessary to ensure that all Maine 
children have consistent access to nutritious meals. Our strategy is to maximize access to USDA Child Nutrition 
Programs - commonly known as school lunch, school breakfast, afterschool meals, and summer meals. 
Today, I'm submitting testimony in support of LD 1002 "An Act To Require A Lunch Period of at Least 30 Minutes for 
Students and Reduce Food Waste." We want to thank Representative Dodge for her leadership to make sure Maine 
students have a healthy, productive school day by guaranteeing enough time to eat lunch and be outside. 
LD 1002 directs schools to allow for a lunch period of at least 30 minutes with recess scheduled before lunch. It also 
encourages the use of share tables for leftover, untouched and prepackaged food. This bill includes an opt-out if a 30 
minute lunch period isn't feasible. 
Maine has the highest rate of childhood food insecurity in New England, with 1 in 6 kidsl lacking consistent access to 
nutrition. For many students, school meals are the only reliable source of food and the most nutritious meals they 
receivez , and Maine's historic law to feed every child at school at no cost has helped to reduce the stigma around school 
meals resulting in more students eating. This also means longer lunch lines. Now that meals are free for all students, 
we must work to make sure they have enough time to actually eat them. If food is going into the trash or compost after 
a rushed lunch period and not into students ’ bellies, none of the incredible benefits of proper nutrition at school are 
being realized. Unfortunately, we are hearing from students and parents across the state that lunch periods are too 
short and students don't have enough time to eat the meals available to them. On a personal note, l have heard this 
from my 12 year old son nearly every day of his school career. 
To gather more information about this issue, Full Plates conducted two surveys: one of students, parents, and 
community members; and another of school administrators. We received 101 responses from students, parents, and 
community members and 174 responses from school administrators. The data collected through these surveys displays 
the complexity of this issue. 
On the one hand, 77% of students surveyed report that they don't have enough time to eat lunch at school, and 65% of 
those students named long lunch lines as the main issue. 83% of parents and guardians and 76% of other school and 
community members surveyed say that students do not have enough time to eat. 
On the other hand, school administrators report facing many logistical barriers like limited staffing and multi-use spaces 
that make longer lunch periods challenging. They also express concern that behavior issues in the cafeteria are likely to 
increase with longer lunch periods, and many have observed behavior issues during the last 5-10 minutes of lunch.

When asked what support they would need to implement a 30 minute lunch period, the top two supports identified 
were additional staffing and a longer school day. 39 school administrators surveyed report that they currently have 30 
minute lunch periods at their schools. 
Study after study has shown that longer lunch periods combined with recess before lunch result in increased 
consumption of lunch with greater consumption of nutritious foodsa/‘,5 , improved student behavior in the cafeteria and 
the classrooms, ’ and decreased food wastes. 
Like other bills brought before this committee to ensure recess time for middle school students and a later start time for 
high school students, this bill is an important part of the broader conversation happening in the state about how we can 
ensure that the school day supports happy, healthy, and prepared students. Schools need support to implement these 
research-driven solutions. Furthermore, households across our state are struggling with rising costs and the end of 
covid-era assistance like extra SNAP dollars leading to increased food insecurity. School meals are more important than 
ever, and we ask this committee to make sure students are getting the nutrition they need to succeed at school by 
passing LD 1002. Thank you for your time and consideration, I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
