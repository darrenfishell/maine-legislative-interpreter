Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 1158 , An Act to Recognize the Critical Nature of Workforce Development Through Career 
and Technical Education by Establishing an Adjustment for Career and  Technical Education 
Centers in the School Funding Formula  would require the Commissioner of Education to 
calculate  a per-pupil E ssential Programs and Services (E PS) rate for career and technical 
education ( CTE ) centers based on costs of equipment and infrastructure, transportation, and 
staffing.  The cost -driven EPS f unding formula is outlined in Title 20 -A, ยง15671. The funding 
methodology of the educational cost components must be established based on available 
research.   
Funding for Career and Technical Education centers and regions is calculated and disbursed 
based on the funding model as provided in Title 20 -A, Chapter 606 -B ยง15688 -A.  Currently, the 
State funds 100% of CTE costs  as determined by the CTE funding formula , which includes  a 
per-pupil component,  direct instruction staff, administration, operations & maintenance , and 
student and staff supports including CTE program transportation. For FY23 and FY24 State CTE 
funding is $62.2 and $66.4 million respectively .   
Currently, CTE programs have access to state grant funds to meet their equipment needs. Each 
year the D epartment of Education  includes $2 million to provide opportunities for CTE programs 
to update minor equipment to align with national industry standards.  as indicated in  Title 20 -A, 
Chapter 606 -B ยง15688 -A subsection 6 .  There is also curr ently a $20 million bond that is availab le 
until June of 2025 that is specific to equipment and infrastructure related to equipment . This bill 
would require the collection and analysis of new data regarding CTE equipment purchase needs 
and may require additional staff to organize and maintain th is information. Even more pressing is 
the concern that funding equipment for all CTEs annually would be expensive and  would  
exacerbate equity between CTEs that have chosen to offer many programs and those that have 
not, as well as between regular education programs and CTE programs . Since funding for CTE is 
100%  state funded , yet come out of the same available funding for all schools,  there would be

less funding available for distribution to school administrative units ( SAUs ) for regular education  
unless a significant amount of additional funding were to be provided by the State.  
The second  concern with the language of the bill is that there is no consideration for CTE 
regions, only CTE centers. A CTE region is a catchmen t area for several school administrative 
units and therefore if the intention of this bill is to exclude regions,  approximately 3,400 students 
would be left without properly funded resources.  
A third concern  of the bill is that i ncludes  items that are already accounted for in the CTE  
funding  model , namely staff and CTE program transportation , transportation for students to 
worksites .  Transportation to and from the CTE from the sending SAU is the responsibility of the 
sending SAU and  is included in the  transportation subsidy  allocated to the sending  SAU s by the 
EPS formula.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1158  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,
