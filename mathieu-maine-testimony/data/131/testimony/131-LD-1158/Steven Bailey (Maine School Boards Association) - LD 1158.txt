TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1158 
AN ACT TO RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL NATURE OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH 
CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION BY ESTABLISHING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR CAREER 
AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTERS IN THE SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School SuperintendentsI 
Association, in support of L.D. ll58. 
While we don’t know the speciﬁcs of the calculation to determine a CTE Center’s per pupil rate for each year, 
what we do know is that equipment in the CTE centers has not had a means for replacement in prior years. 
Only recently did they receive a one-time infusion of funds to help replace out-of-date and broken equipment. 
CTE centers and regions now are funded through an allocation model, and through the amendment being 
proposed by MACTE, we understand that the per-pupil rate is to be calculated through the CTE allocation and 
not within the K-12 EPS per-pupil rate as stated within the original version of this bill. 
In addition to needing funding for replacement or new equipment, the cost to transport students to and from 
their work sites has not been adequately funded and is not included as a paid-for expense within the K-l2 
transportation or CTE budget. These work experiences are critical to the on-the-job practical application of 
their classroom leaming and training. 
The third request regarding staffing is an important one based on the location of the CTE Centers and Regions 
— and can mean the difference of a program being offered or not. Losing the opportunity to host a program for 
students in a geographic region of the state can mean the difference in the success of students wishing to enter 
that vocation. 
MS SA and MSBA both support the intent of this bill and would like to see the appropriate funding be 
included in the model to support both these requests.
