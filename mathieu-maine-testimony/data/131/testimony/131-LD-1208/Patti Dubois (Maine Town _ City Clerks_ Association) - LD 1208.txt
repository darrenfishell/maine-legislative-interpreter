Re: LD 1208 – An Act to Implement  the Recommendations  of the Right to Know  
Advisory  Committee  Concerning  Time Estimates  for Responding  to Public  Records  
Requests  
 
Position: Support 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is in support of LD 1208 and we thank you for the 
opportunity to outline our points for your Committee. 
 
The clarifying language to specify the estimated time frame by which a request will be 
satisfied is supported by our members.  In addition, language to specify that the cost is 
based on the time spent to search for, retrieve and compile the request is helpful.   
 
The proposed increase from $30 to $50 where the agency must inform the requestor of the 
amount before proceeding the request is reasonable to our members.   
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at 
207)680-4210 or by email: pdubois@waterville-me.gov  .
