Testimony of Paul Cavanaugh, DPS FOAA records officer, Legislative 
Liaison, and MSP Staff Attorney 
IN REGARD TO LD 1208 
An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Right to Know Advisory 
Committee Concerning Time Estimates for Responding to Public Record 
Requests 
Senator Carney, Rep. Moonen and distinguished Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary. My name is Paul Cavanaugh, and lam the 
FOAA officer and legislative liaison for the Department of Public Safety and 
the Staff Attorney for the l\/laine State Police. l am here today to testify on 
behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State Police 
regarding LD 1208: we are neither for nor against the proposals but seek 
clarification. 
Section 1 of LD 1208 proposes amendments t0 1 MRS §408-A(3) and I would 
note that LD 1203 also proposes amendments to that section and 
subparagraph that should be coordinated with these proposals. 
Section 2 of LD 1208 proposes to amend 1 MRS §408-A(8) which currently 
authorizes the agency or official responding to a FOAA request to chargea

fee to cover the actual costs of responding to the request to allowing onlya 
fee for the time spent responding to the request. The actual costs could 
include postage, paper, copying, thumb drives, services and similar costs 
triggered by the request while the amendment would only allow recovery of 
time spent. ln some instances, for some agencies, this could be a large 
unfunded mandate to have to absorb the price of costs instead of being able 
to charge a fee for those costs. 
We are neither for nor against LD 1208 but suggest any amendments to 
§408-A(8) within multiple new LDs are coordinated to avoid amending 
amendments that are not intended and we want to point out the potential 
costs to agencies responding to requests if they cannot charge a fee for the 
actual cost of responding but only for the time spent responding. 
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the l\/laine State Police, I 
thank you for your time and would be happy to try and answer any questions 
that you might have.
