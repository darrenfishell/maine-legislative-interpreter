In Support of  
LD 1208 -  An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Right To  Know Advisory Committee 
Concerning Time Estimates for Responding to Public Records Requests  
April 3, 2023  
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the  Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca 
Lambert, and I am providing testimony in support of LD 1208 on behalf of the Maine Municipal 
Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC 
provides direction to the  advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal 
interest.    
Any effort to clarify statutory language is welcome and encouraged by municipal leaders. 
Likewise, officials strive to fulfill Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests  and provide  the public with 
access to requested documents in a timely and cost- effective manner , as it is important to both citizens 
and local leader s. 
Additionally, g iven that the fee an agency may charge for complying with an FOIA request 
increased from $15 an hour to $25 an hour, municipal officials agree that it makes sense to also increase the threshold by which an estimate of the total cost for compliance be furnished to the requester before proceeding  with the request, be greater than $50 (previously  $30).  
For these reasons the LPC supports LD 1208. Thank you for your time and considering the 
municipal perspective.
