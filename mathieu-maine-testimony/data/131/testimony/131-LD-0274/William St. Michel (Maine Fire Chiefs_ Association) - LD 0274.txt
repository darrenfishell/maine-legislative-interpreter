Testimony in Opposition of LD 274 An Act Regarding Municipal Costs for 
Water Used for Firefighting
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and distinguished members of The Joint 
Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services. My 
name is William St. Michel, I am the retired Fire Chief of The Town of Durham 
and currently The Executive Director for Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association. Maine 
Fire Chiefs’ Association does not support LD 274, An Act Regarding Municipal 
Costs for Water Used for Firefighting.
Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association feels that while LD 274 may address issues for 
some communities it could impede other communities. We feel strongly that due 
to the diversity of water systems and their purveyors across the State this is not 
a one size fits all issue and is better handled on a local level.
Maine Fire Chiefs’ Association would like to request that you do not move LD 
274 forward. Thank you for your time!
Sincerely,
William St. Michel
