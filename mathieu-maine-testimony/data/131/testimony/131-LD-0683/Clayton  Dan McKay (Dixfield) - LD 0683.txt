Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
 The attached PDF is just one of many avenues available for rate reductions. EMT 
surely has many suggestions on providing moneys for immediate rate relief. 
This committee needs to act on behalf of the ratepayers during this session. Kicking 
the can down the road is no longer an option. 
Be certain that people voting in the next elections will consider what was 
accomplished for the ratepayers by actions of this committee.
Yours Truly
