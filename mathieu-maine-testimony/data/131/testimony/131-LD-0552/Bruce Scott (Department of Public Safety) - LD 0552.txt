Testimony of Lt. Bruce ‘Scott 
IN SUPPORT or LD 552 
An Act Regarding the Deﬁnition of "Reportable Accident" 
Senator Chipman, Rep. Williams, and distinguished Members of the Ioint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, my name is Lt. Bruce Scott, and I am the 
Commanding Ofﬁcer of the State Police Traffic Safety Unit. I am here today to 
testify on behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State Police in 
Support of LD 552. 
This bill will create an adjustment to inflation and exorbitant repair costs, which 
will reduce the number of reportable crashes. The last time this threshold was 
adjusted was in 2.007. Inﬂation estimations to date values the 2007 $1,000 at 
approximately $1, 500 today, so there is already a need for an increase of $500 just 
based on inﬂation. Another increase of $500 for additional wiggle room could be 
justiﬁed with the current climate of vehicle repair costs and a shortage of 
automotive parts that are driving up costs. A majority of the crashes that occur 
that are valued at less than $2,000 in damage, occur in parking lots at low speeds, 
circumstances which are not utilized by DOT for statistical analysis when 
determining engineering, education or enforcement decisions. 
For these reasons, we urge you to vote in favor of LD 552. 
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State Police, I thank 
you for your time and would be happy to try and answer any questions that you 
might have.
