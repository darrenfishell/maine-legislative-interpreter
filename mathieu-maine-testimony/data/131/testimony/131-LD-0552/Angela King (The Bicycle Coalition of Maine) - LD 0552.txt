Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 552
An Act Regarding the Definition of "Reportable Accident"
Greeting distinguished members of the Committee on Transportation:
My name is Angela King and I submit this testimony on behalf of the Bicycle Coalition
of Maine (BCM) in opposition to LD 552, which would increase the amount of property damage
necessary to trigger a police report from $1000 to $2000.  BCM ur ges the committee to issue an
Ought Not to Pass report on this bill, unless amendments are made that acknowledge lower
amounts of property damage in bicycle crashes.
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide or ganization that advocates for bicyclists
and pedestrians. We work to make Maine better for bicycling and walking, and to protect the
safety and rights of vulnerable users of the public ways.
In general, the BCM has two major concerns about LD 552, a bill designed to “update”
section 29-A  M.R.S 2251 (the crash reporting statute). Those concerns are detailed in the
testimony of BCM board member and attorney Lauri Boxer Macomber , and are presented in a
briefer form here.
●
First, BCM is concerned that incr easing the pr operty damage thr eshold for  crash
reporting is likely to r esult in the further  underr eporting of bicycle crash collisions on
Maine public ways.
Many bicycle (and pedestrian) crashes already do not generate police reports, and this bill is
going to exacerbate that problem. This is particularly likely in the case of crashes between
bicycle riders and motor vehicles, in which the bicycle may be totaled but the motor vehicle
incurs less than $1000 of damage. For a low income person who has lost their license and is
dependent upon their bicycle for transportation, the loss of that bicycle that cost only $50 may be
a very significant problem for them. For other riders, it is easy to rack up hundreds of dollars in
damages to carbon frames or wheels, but because the statutory amount is not reached, a police
report may not be generated unless the rider complains of personal injury . Raising the statutory
limit to $2000 will only increase the likelihood that crashes which damage the personal property
of bicycle riders will not be reported.
These reports are critical for helping to prioritize both MaineDOT  infrastructure projects
and police traf fic safety details.
At a minimum, this committee should act to protect bicyclists by amending the language
of LD 552 to read:  “$2,000 or more, unless the event involves a bicyclist, in which case the
threshold amount for a report shall be $50.00.”

●
Second, BCM is concerned with the continued use of the inappr opriate word “accident”
in LD 552, 29-A  M.R.S. §2251 et seq. and other  portions of the Motor  Vehicle and
Traffic Code.
Many state and federal entities have eliminated the term “accident” from their forms, websites,
educational materials because the word “accident” serves to reinforce the idea that drivers have
no control over dangerous operational choices (like driving intoxicated, intexticated, or
distracted).
The State of Maine’ s Bureau of Highway Safety also ur ges the elimination of the word
“accident” in its “Driving Dynamics” Manual.  More specifically , page 7 of that manual states:
The Bureau of Highway Safety wishes to be consistent with Federal terminology in referring to
crashes. Terminologies such as “crash”, “collision”, “incident” and “injury” are preferred
alternative to the word “accident”. . . .We will also work to encourage others to limit the use of
the term “accident” and use the more appropriate terminology. . . . In reality, crashes are
predictable results of specific actions and the continued use of the word “accident” implies that
these events are outside human influence or control.  (State of Maine,  Bureau of Highway
Safety,
Driving Dynamics Manual,
p.7)
In light of these other recommendations to move away from the word “accident,”  we ur ge the
members of the Transportation Committee to amend LD 552 to substitute the word “crash” and
make corresponding changes in the remainder of the crash reporting statutory scheme.
We urge you to look carefully at the ar guments of our board member and attorney Lauri
Boxer -Macomber to fully appreciate why this bill as written should not pass unless additional
changes to the bill language are made. BCM is at your service to assist with drafting such
language.
Thank you for your time and service to the people of Maine.
Sincerely ,
Angela King
