“An Act Regarding Trustee Duties to Beneﬁciaries” 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Introduction 
The Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission (“PATLAC”) hereby submits the following 
comments to L D 1763, “An Act Regarding Trustee Duties to Beneﬁciaries, ” which would 
amend Sections 810, 818, 819, and 1004 of Title 18-B — the Maine Uniform Trust Code 
General Comments 
It appears that the proposed amendments to Title 18-B were precipitated by a speciﬁc 
matter involving a trust and a beneﬁciary with physical or mental disabilities However, 
PATLAC 1S concerned that if enacted, the proposed amendments will have signiﬁcant 
unintended consequences and therefore PATLAC opposes the enactment of L D 1763 
PATLAC’s primary concems are the following 
(a) Some of the proposed changes are inconsistent or conﬂict with other provisions of 
the Maine Uniform Trust Code, 
(b) The proposed changes represent a departure from the language of the Uniform 
Trust Code, and unless there is a compelling reason for deviating from a Uniform 
Act, PATLAC favors maintaimng tmiformity with Uniform Acts, 
(c) The proposed changes could have the unintended consequences of discouraging 
settlors from establishing trusts in Mame and professional ﬁduciaries from serving 
as trustee, leaving beneﬁciaries vulnerable to decisions and actions of 
inexperienced trustees, and 
(d) The Maine Uniform Trust Code already has many provisions aimed at protecting 
all beneﬁciaries, including beneﬁciaries with disabilities, which provisions are 
intertwined with other trust code provisions and that work together, in harmony, 
as a cohesive set of statutes 
1. Section 1. 18-B MRSA §810, sub-§5. The Maine Uniform Trust Code contains 
requirements and default provisions for trusts Trusts are voluntary and private contracts 
made by individuals for the beneﬁt of others Individuals are able to establish trusts on their 
own terms, Sl1b_]6Ct only to certain requirements in the Maine Uniform Trust Code that may 
not be altered by the terms of the trust The trustee is sub] ect to signiﬁcant ﬁduciary duties 
in the management, reporting and distribution of the trust The Maine Uniform Trust Code 
contains well established standards for trustee’s duties to report to the beneﬁciaries, and 
balances settlors ’ autonomy to establish trusts consistent with their personal preferences 
and the relationship between the trust, the trustee and the beneﬁciaries The proposed

amendment to T1tle 18-B, §810 would add add1t1onal report1ng requlrements to a Trustee’s 
ex1st1ng statutory dut1es Sect1on 813 (“Duty to mform and report”) already requlres 
Trustees to keep Quahﬁed Beneﬁc1ar1es “reasonably lnformed about the adm1n1strat10n of 
the trust and of the materlal facts necessary for them to protect the1r 1nterests ” Th1s 
1nc1udes the duty to (a) promptly furmsh a copy of the trust to any beneﬁc1ary who so 
requests, (b) notlfy all qual1ﬁed beneﬁclarles — 1n advance — of any change 1n the method 
or rate of the trustee’s compensat1on, and (c) report — at least am1ually - the trust property, 
l1ab1l1t1es, recelpts and d1sbursements, 1nclud1ng the source and amount of the trustee's 
compensatlon, and a l1st1ng of the trust assets “to the d1str1butees or perm1ss1ble d1str1butees 
of trust mcome or pr1nc1pal, and to the other quahﬁed beneﬁclarles who request 1t” 
The proposed amendment to T1tle 18-B, §810 1s 1n conﬂ1ct w1th §8l3 and the mandatory 
report1ng requ1rements 1n T1tle 18-B, §105(H) and (I) The proposed amendment would 
expand the scope of §8l3 by expandlng the pool of potent1al rec1p1ents beyond 
“d1str1butees or perm1ss1ble d1str1butees of trust mcome or pr1nc1pal, and to the other 
quahﬁed beneﬁclarles Who request 1t” to gg beneﬁclag who requests a report, regardless 
of whether the beneﬁc1ary 1s a perm1ss1ble beneﬁc1ary, a qua11ﬁed beneﬁc1ary, or a non- 
vested contmgent (1 e , extremely remote) beneﬁc1ary 
Because the proposed change to §810 would expand the scope of §8l3 to mclude remote, 
cont1ngent beneﬁc1ar1es, may requ1re trustees to make reports aga1nst the Settlor’s wr1tten 
d1rect1ons 1n the trust and because th1s change would represent a s1gn1ﬁcant departure from 
the Un1form Trust Code, PATLAC recommends that §810 g be amended as prov1ded 1n 
L D 1763 
Section 2. 18-B MRSA §818.The proposed amendment to T1tle 18-B, §8l8 would add 
add1t1onal dut1es on trustees of trusts oWn1ng real property, 1nclud1ng the duty to have 
a current appra1sal 1n hand before se1l1ng trust-owned real property and, 1f a beneﬁc1ary 
1s res1d1ng 1n such real property, a duty to arrange for “alternatlve hous1ng of the same 
or s1m11ar quahty and accommodat1ons as the real property or dwell1ng bemg sold or 
conveyed” 
PATLAC belleves ex1st1ng prov1s1ons of the Ma1ne Un1form Trust Code provlde 
sufﬁc1ent and appropr1ate protect1on for beneﬁc1ar1es The Ma1ne (and Un1form) Trust 
Code already 1mposes ﬁduclary dutles of loyalty — adm1n1strat1on of the trust solely 1n 
beneﬁc1ar1es’ lnterests (§802), 1mpart1al1ty - (§803), and prudent adm1n1strat1on - 
“reasonable care, Sklll and cautlon (§804) on trustees w1th regard to all act1ons of the 
trustee, 1nclud1ng the sale of real estate Further §801 mandates that a trustee 
“admrmster the trust m good fa1th, m accordance w1th 1ts terms and purposes and the mterests 
of the beneﬁc1ar1es and m accordance wlth th1s Code” 
As noted above, any sale would be governed by var1ous ﬁducrary dut1es of a trustee 
The duty of prudent adm1n1strat1on 1n the sale of real estate does not have a one s1ze 
ﬁts all solutlon 
Page 2 of5
Prudent adm1n1strat1on may lnclude a cert1ﬁed appralsal before a prlvate sale, or 
lnclude a comparatlve market analys1s by realtors before l1st1ng property on the 
market, however, mandatmg a cert1ﬁed appra1sa1 requ1rement lntroduces a mechan1cal 
step wh1ch may or may not be relevant or _]LlStlﬁ8d under the terms of the trust and the 
crrcumstances of the sale, and may be counter to the trustee’s duty to conslder the sole 
1nterests of the beneﬁclarles In add1t1on to the expense and potent1al 1nconven1ence 
th1s would cause, 1n a rapldly changlng real estate market w1th a short “sell1ng season,” 
the length of t1me occas1onally requ1red to obta1n a quahﬁed appra1sal could 
s1gn1ﬁcantly lmpact the sale pr1ce that a trustee can obta1n for the trust beneﬁcrarles 
A sale to a related party 1s already SL1b_]€Ct to several speclal requ1rements and 1s 
voldable under §802(2) for farlure by the trustee to meet the statute’s requlrements In 
add1t1on, the proposed amendment 1s s1lent about the d1fferences between cert1ﬁed 
appralsals and market analyses, and 1mpl1cat1ons of an appralsal, such as what would 
happen 1f the trustee 1s Lmable to ﬁnd a buyer at the appralsed value or 1f the property 
1s on the market for more than 90 days after a l1st1ng at the appralsal value Frnally, 
PATLAC 1s concerned about the requ1rement that a trustee ﬁnd “altematlve hous1ng 
of the same or s1m11ar quahty and accommodat1ons as the real property or dwell1ng 
be1ng sold or conveyed ” Who dec1des whether the alternatlve hous1ng 1s “the same or 
s1m1lar‘7” What factors are cons1dered 1n mak1ng th1s determ1nat1on'7 What 1f the trust 
doesn’t have sufﬁclent funds to ma1nta1n ownersh1p of the real property or alternat1ve 
real property ‘? The underly1ng foundat1on of trust law 1s that a settlor establ1shes a trust 
and sets forth the terms, albe1t cons1stent w1th Well-establ1shed laws on trusts A trustee 
should only be requlred to prov1de alternat1ve hous1ng 1f the settlor provldes such an 
1nstruct1on 1n the prov1s1ons of the trust To mandate altematlve housmg fora 
beneﬁc1ary, when the settlor has not prov1ded such an 1nstruct1on, runs the r1sk of 
underm1n1ng the settlor’s purposes of the trust For example, suppose an adult ch1ld 
was l1vmg w1th a parent when the parent d1ed leavmg a trust to beneﬁt her three 
ch1ldren equally Th1s sect1on would subvert the settlor’ s 1ntent1on to treat her ch1ldren 
equally and 1nstead essent1a1ly requ1re the other two ch1ldren to subs1d1ze hous1ng 
(1ndeﬁn1tely‘7) for the th1rd 
Because the proposed change to §818 would place add1t1onal requlrements (and 
expense) on trustees of trusts that own real property, would 1nterfere w1th a trustee's 
ab1l1ty to exerclse 1ts d1scret1on, 1s overly broad, may lead to profess1onal trustees 
be1ng reluctant to accept trusteeshlp for trusts that own real property, and would 
represent a s1gn1ﬁcant departure from the Unlforrn Trust Code, PATLAC recommends 
that §8l8 not be amended as prov1ded 1n L D 1763 
Section 3. 18-B MRSA §819.The proposed amendment to T1tle 18-B, §819 would 
requ1re trustees of trusts for the beneﬁt of someone w1th phys1cal or mental d1sab1l1t1es 
to make “appropr1ate accommodat1ons to ensure that the trustee and the 
adm1n1strat1on of the trust meet the speclal needs of the beneﬁc1ary ” The proposed 
amendment seems to be mandatlng an amblguous trust d1str1but1on standard and 
thereby usurp1ng settlors ’ rlghts to establ1sh the1r own standards for the1r 1ntended 
beneﬁc1ar1es, and the vague standard may adversely 1mpact necessary pubhc beneﬁts 
Page 3 of5
on wh1ch a beneﬁc1ary relres It 1s unclear to PATLAC what spec1ﬁc concerns th1s 
prov1s1on 1s deslgned to address In add1t1on, PATLAC 1s unsure of what an 
“approprlate accommodat1on ” would look l1ke Flnally, the expense of “appropr1ate 
accommodat1ons, ” whatever those are, may very well be cost proh1b1t1ve for many 
trusts 
Because th1s change would be a s1gn1ﬁcant departure from the Un1form Trust Code, 1t 
1s not clear what would be requ1red of trustees for trusts beneﬁt1ng someone w1th 
phys1cal or mental d1sab1l1t1es, and the change may d1scourage settlors from 
establ1sh1ng trusts for persons w1th d1sab1l1t1es and at the same t1me may make 
professlonal trustees reluctant to accept trusteesh1p for trusts that beneﬁt (now or 1n 
the future) a beneﬁc1ary w1th phys1ca1 or mental d1sab1l1t1es, PATLAC recommends 
that §819 not be amended as prov1ded 1n L D 1763 
4. Section 4. 18-B MRSA §1004.The proposed amendment to T1tle 18-B, §1004 would 
requlre that a trustee make a show1ng to the court of a reasonable l1kel1hood of 
preva1l1ng 1n a matter aga1nst a beneﬁc1ary pr1or to expend1ng trust funds 1n the matter 
and would allow a beneﬁc1ary to use trust funds 1n a controversy aga1nst the trustee on 
showlng the court a colorable clarm PATLAC bel1eves that §l004, as currently 
const1tuted, prov1des sufﬁc1ent and appropr1ate gu1dance for when, and under what 
c1rcu1nstances 1t 1s approprrate for trust resources to be expended on behalf of a trustee 
and/or a beneﬁc1ary Sect1on 1001 prov1des that a v1olat1on of a trustee’s duty toa 
beneﬁc1ary 1s a breach of trust and prov1des more than 10 remed1es for beneﬁc1ar1es 
We bel1eve the proposed amendment would result 1n add1t1onal (and potent1ally 
confusmg) layers for trustees, beneﬁc1ar1es, and the courts to cons1der when 
determ1n1ng the appropr1ateness of us1ng trust funds for costs and fees The ex1st1ng 
§l004 properly leaves th1s determ1nat1on to the court If a trustee 1mproperly uses trust 
assets 1n a controversy agalnst a beneﬁc1ary, the court has the author1ty under 
§100l(2)(C) to order the trustee to make repayment of those assets to the trust 
Because th1s change would be a s1gn1ﬁcant departure from the Un1form Trust Code, 
and a s1gn1ﬁcant change to Ma1ne law, wh1ch aga1n may lead to professlonal trustees 
be1ng reluctant to serve 1n that role, PATLAC recommends that §1004 not be amended 
as prov1ded 1n L D 1763 
Concluslon 
PATLAC 1s concemed that these changes (1) add uncerta1nty and amb1gu1ty to the Ma1ne 
Un1for1n Trust Code, wh1ch 1n turn could lead to unnecessary and expens1ve l1t1gat1on, (11) 
would lead to a lack of un1form1ty among states that have enacted the Un1for1n Trust Code, 
(111) would add add1t1onal expense to the adm1n1strat1on of trusts 1n Ma1ne, (1v) may not lead 
to the des1red result, but may lnstead d1scourage settlors from creat1ng trusts 1n the ﬁrst place, 
and (v) drssuade professlonal trustees from accept1ng trusteesh1ps 1n Mame The proposed 
amendments under1n1ne the Marne Un1form Trust Code’s underly1ng purpose of replaclng a 
patchwork of laws w1th a cons1stent legal framework for settlors, trustees and beneﬁc1ar1es 
Page 4 of5
who often reslde 1n d1fferent states In a t1me when many states are courtmg the bus1ness of 
trusts and trust companles by enactlng modern trust laws, th1s proposed amendment would 
move Mame decldedly 1n the opposlte d1rect1on For these reasons, the Probate and Trust Law 
Adv1sory Comm1ss1on recommends that L D 1763 not be enacted
