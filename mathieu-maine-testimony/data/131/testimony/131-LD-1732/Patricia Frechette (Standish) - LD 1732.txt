Dear Committee Members:
Absolutely not....  It's time to get people off welfare.  There are many jobs available,  
jobs paying good starting wages with benefits.  Let's stop this insanity and stop 
making the taxpayer pay more than their fair share.  
I am retired and still pay plenty of taxes, and I don't make that much..  Insanity.  We 
need TAX REFORM not more welfare.
I ask that you vote OUGHT NOT to PASS, Thank you.
