Testimony of Deborah Ibonwa, Maine Equal Justice in support of 
LD 1664, An Act to Increase Reimbursement Under the General Assistance Program, and LD 
1732, An Act to Expand the General Assistance Program 
May 5, 2023 
Good morning Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services My name 1S Deborah Ibonwa, I use she/her pronouns, and I ama 
Legal Advocate at Maine Equal Justice We are a civil legal services organization Working with 
and for people with low income seeking solutions to poverty through legal representation, 
organizing, education, and pohcy advocacy I am testifying in support of LD 1664 and LD 
1732 
LD 1664 and LD 1732 are common-sense proposals to streamline the delivery of assistance 
to people who are in need of shelter and rental assistance at this unprecedented time. 
LD 1664 and LD 1732 both increase the amount of state reimbursement from 70% to 90% for 
the cost of General Assistance (GA) incurred by each municipality and Indian tribe - a needed 
change to ensure municipalities can continue to assist their residents experiencing ﬁnancial 
hardships in the face of a growing housing crisis leading to more people seeking help In 
addition, LD 1732 provides state reimbursement for additional program costs, including 
emergency general assistance, temporary housing, interpreter services, and administrative 
expenses GA exists to help the most needy people in Maine It beneﬁts us all when our 
neighbors are safe from the harms of living on the street This proposal will enable more people 
to be able to get the amount of assistance they need by increasing the overall reimbursement rate 
These proposals would have an immense impact on the lives of our most vulnerable neighbors A 
high rate of rennbursement which is guaranteed to municipalities for something such as rental 
assistance would make GA a more reliable source of rent in the eyes of landlords, reducing the 
risk of discrimination based on “source of income” and increasing the number of people Who 
would be able to maintain housing and shelter 
LD 1732 would streamline the GA process in several different ways 
1 Requiring municipalities to accept applications for GA during regular business hours, 
which means all GA ofﬁces would be required to have consistent hours of operation 
Right now, some GA ofﬁces are open only one day a week or for _]l.1SlZ one or a few hours
1
each week This portion of the bill would create program uniformity and make it easier 
for those in need to access assistance no matter where they live 
2 Requiring training for overseers or appointed municipal officers within 120 days of 
appointment Right now, the statute does not requrre training This provision will result in 
greater consistency in the administration of GA across the state 
3 It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide the S6I‘V1C6S 
necessary to support municipalities, including education and training for certain state 
employees, 24-hour technical assistance, written decisions and a database 
LD 1664 would also help ensure that the municipalities that bear the lion’s share of 
responsibility for providing GA to vulnerable people in the state can continue to do so ina 
way that is efficient, sustainable, and in accordance with the law. 
The bill proposes to ﬂ(l_]LlSll the state’s rate of reimbursement for towns and cities that provide a 
greater amount of GA to people There are several reasons why certam municipalities in the state 
provide assistance to signiﬁcantly more people than others 
O Population. Larger towns and cities like Portland, Bangor, and Lewiston have more 
people and so naturally would have larger numbers of people seeking assistance from the 
local GA ofﬁces 
O Economy: For as long as there have been cities, people struggling to make ends meet 
have migrated to them in search of opportunity Despite their bigger economies, they 
aren’t perfectly efﬁcient machines that can absorb all who seek a better life, so some end 
up seekrng assistance This happens for a wide variety of reasons, but one is that larger 
populations come with greater labor competition and people struggling with poverty in 
the ﬁrst place often lack marketable skills or other challenges that impact their ability to 
work, such as physical or inental health issues, lack of transportation, or housing 
insecurity Another is that the low-wage work that is more attainable may not pay enough 
to help people make ends meet 
0 Services. Bigger populations and bigger economies also mean more infrastructure and 
institutions, such as hospitals, schools, government services, and non-governmental 
service providers For this reason, larger towns are sometimes referred to as “service 
centers, ” and it is/ natural for people who are struggling with poverty and dealing witha 
variety of dire situations to go to where they might be able to get help 
The positive impacts of LD 1664 and LD 1732 will be seen in areas of Maine that are most 
strained in capacity and resources to administer GA These municipalities are at risk of having to 
signiﬁcantly raise local taxes without a rise in rermbursement rates It is not only fair but the 
obligation of the State to support its municipalities in cases like this These are the most 
populated areas in Maine, with the most resources and infrastructure that can provide support to 
our most vulnerable residents Community organizations that work on the ground are currently 
sharing the burden of this crisis with local GA ofﬁces This should not be the case, as neither GA
2
ofﬁces nor these orgamzatrons have the capaclty that the State does to offer support These b11ls 
W111 help ensure our servlce hubs can contlnue to r1se to the challenges of th1s moment 
LD 1664 and LD 1732 are Good Startlng Polnts for a Multl-Pronged Approach to Flx GA. 
For these many reasons, 1t 1s 1mportant to pass LD 1664 and LD 1732 Yet 1t 1s also true that 
there are other changes needed for GA to be most successful Whrle 1t 1s a v1ta1 program, GA 
does not work as efﬁclently as 1t could, and th1s 1s not due to Just one shortcomrng In add1t1on to 
address1ng the rermbursement rate, there are other measures that can strengthen th1s program, 
1nclud1ng rncreased overs1ght, tra1n1ng, longer el1g1b1l1ty per1ods, and cons1stent ad1n1n1strat1on 
These types of structural changes have been studred and recommended by multlple GA workrng 
groups 1n 2013, 2015, and 2019 Each of these groups conslsted of a var1ety of stakeholders, such 
as mun1c1pal welfare d1rectors, Ma1ne Mun1c1pal Assoc1at1on, advocates for Ma1ners W1th low- 
lncome, veterans, consumers, local housmg authorltles, Mame State Hous1ng Authonty, and 
DHHS The recommendatrons of these Workmg groups can serve as a gu1de to mak1ng the GA 
program Work better for both those 1n need and for mun1c1pa11t1es 
Conclusion 
We all know that Marne 1s 1n the mldst of a housmg cr1s1s and today GA prov1des cr1t1cal 
ass1stance to keep people housed or to help support people 1n ﬁndlng new housmg The 
proposals 1n LDs 1664 and 1732 W111 strengthen GA through common sense solutrons GA 1s the 
program that 1s most 1mmed1ately ava1lable to the most vulnerable Ma1ners G1ven the 1ncreas1ng 
number of Mamers stmggllng W1th hous1ng 1nsecur1ty and ﬁnanc1al 1nstab1l1ty, the mumc1pa11t1es 
that provlde the largest share of GA are belng stretched beyond the1r ab1l1ty to meet the needs of 
thelr resldents LD 1664 and LD 1732 propose changes that would make an rmmedlate pos1t1ve 
lmpact In partlcular, an 1ncrease 1n the re1mbursement rate would act as a ﬁre extrngulsher for 
the ﬁre that our largest c1t1es and many towns are experrenclng For these reasons we urge you to 
pass these b1lls And we also ask that you look at the other changes needed to make GA work 
even better for the mun1c1pal1t1es adm1n1ster1ng 1t, and, most lmportantly, for the people who 
need the ass1stance 1t prov1des 
Thank you for the opportun1ty to express our support for these rmportant b111s and urge you to 
vote Ought to Pass on LD 1664 and LD 1732 I am happy to answer any questlons you mrght 
have and I can be avallable for the work sesslon
