My apology if you got this twice, we had a power glitch and not sure it sent.
LD 1732- As the immediate past president of the Maine Welfare Directors I fully 
support this bill.  We had a working group that met multiple times to work on this bill.
We believe this bill will assist municipalities and clients greatly, it is not often you get
larger communities and small rural communities in agreement on GA issues.
Thank you for supporting this bill.
