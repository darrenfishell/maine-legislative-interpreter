marijuana toxicity to canines, felines, and all our furry friends.    I strongly support the right of adults to consume marijuana products; I don’t believe it is the role of the State to restrict the right of people to make their own recreational and medical

educated about the risks these products can pose to the creatures we share our homes, parks, 
trails, and communities with.  
 
 Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this written testimony.  Please contact me at any time should you have any questions.   
Sincerely,
