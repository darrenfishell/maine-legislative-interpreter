RE: LD845 THC Warning for Animals
Dear Committee, 
We appreciate that LD845 intends to protect our pets. However, it is inaccurate to say 
that THC is "harmful to animals even in residual amounts." For example, CBD 
products containing .3 percent or less of THC can be beneficial to animals and is not 
considered a controlled substance. 
States like Oklahoma and Rhode Island are considering adding animals to their 
medicinal cannabis laws. California allows veterinarians to recommend cannabis and 
Nevada allows veterinarians to prescribe products under the .3 percent threshold. 
This is a rapidly evolving issue for animal health. THC toxicity is rarely fatal and, 
frankly, THC is less dangerous for dogs than chocolate.  
If the committee elects to move a bill forward, we would recommend a more general 
statement, along the lines of, "do not provide animals THC without consulting a 
veterinarian."
We appreciate the committee's time on this issue and please do not hesitate to contact 
us with any questions.
