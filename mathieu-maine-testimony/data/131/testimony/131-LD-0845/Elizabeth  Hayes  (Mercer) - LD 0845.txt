LD 845
I am submitting written testimony AGAINST LD845, which would require excessive labeling 
requirements for cannabis products that are not required on other products which can also be
toxic to animals. According to the American Vetinary Medical Association, THC poisoning in 
dogs causes a high rate of symptoms but low rates of death and most dogs recover. It also 
mentions that part of the dangers of cannabis edibles for dogs are the toxic ingredients of 
artificial sweeteners and chocolate which can be lethal to dogs.

The cannabis industry if forced to create an excessive amount of packaging and waste in 
order to comply with current packaging and labeling requirements.  I feel this additional 
requirement would be unnecessarily burdensome, excessive and ignores the fact that there 
are many other products in peoples homes which are much more dangerous to dogs and do 
not require warning labels.
Additionally,  there is research from both Cornell University as well as the University of 
Colorado which demonstrates the efficacy and safety of using cannabis products to treat 
seizures and osteoarthritis in dogs.
