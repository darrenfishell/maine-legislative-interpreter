RE: Testimony in Support of LD 134 – An Act to Increase the Handling Fee for 
Beverage Containers Reimbursed to Dealers and Redemption  Centers  
 
Good morning Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and 
Natural Resources Committee : 
 
My name is Nora Bosworth, and I am a Staff Attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation’s 
(“CLF”) Zero Waste Project. CLF’s Zero Waste Project works to identify and address polluting 
and unsustainable waste management practices while promoting proven an d effective solutions 
such as source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting. These goals are the same solutions 
outlined in Maine’s solid waste hierarchy.1 
 
CLF supports LD 134, An Act to Increase the Handling Fee for Beve rage Containers 
Reimbursed to Dealers and Redemption Centers. This emergency bill would increase the 
redemption center handling fee to $.0575 per container and provides for a biannual increase based on the Consumer Price Index established by the federal De partment of Labor, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. This bill recognizes the urgency of stabilizing Maine’s most successful recycling program through helping redemption centers bear the costs of inflation. 
 
Bottle Bills are highly effective at increasing recycling rates, improving the quality and lifecycle of recycled materials, and lessening both litter and our reliance on polluting landfills and incinerators.  
Bolstering and preserving our container redempti on system is integral to helping our state reach 
its statutory goals for waste diversion. Maine’s objective, laid out in 38 M.R.S.A 2132, is to 
recycle or compost half the municipal solid waste generated in Maine by 2021, and to reduce our 
municipal solid waste disposal rate by 5% per capita every 5 years.
2 Maine has not yet met these 
goals.3 If we are committed to these objectives we must also commit to reviving and sustaining 
our most successful recycling program.

 Bottle Bills incentivize recycling and the data shows this incentivization works. People who 
purchase beverage containers covered by a Bottle Bill have a financial incentive to return them to redemption centers for recycling. In Maine, the Bottle Bill is exclusively responsible for every 
glass container that is recycled, and for the majority of plastic containers that are recycled, 
statewide.
4 According to the Container Recycling Institute, states wi th container deposit laws 
recycled aluminum, PET, and glass at a rate of 77%, 57%, and 66% respectively.5 Conversely, 
states without container deposit laws recycled these materials at much lower rates, 36% for aluminum, 17% for PET, and 22% for glass.
6 This means that states with container deposit laws 
recycle these materials at almost twice the rate of recycling as states that do not. Consequently, 
container redemption systems decrease the demand for manufacturing virgin plastic and glass, 
which in turns reduces the greenhouse gas emissions caused by such  manufacturing.7 
 
Maine’s container redemption system has also protected our beautiful state from huge amounts 
of litter over the last 45 years. States that have Bottle Bills on average see beverage container 
litter drop by 70 to 84%.8 A reduction in litter means less contamination of our waters, and fewer 
plastic bottles breaking down in t he natural environment, releasing greenhouse gas emissions.9 
Container redemption systems are straightforward environmental solutions that consistently 
produce  results.  
 
Maine’s Bottle Bill also results in sorting cleaner mate rials, which can be recycled more 
effectively,  more  safely  and for a higher  value.  With  single -stream  recycling,  people  regularly  put 
unrecyclable materials in with the recyclable ones. Consequently, “the entire stream becomes 
contaminated, and the effort required to re -separate those materials far outweighs the economic 
value of the resulting recycling stream so that recycling compa nies understandably choose not  to

do it.”10 Notably, 25% of what  consumers  put into single -stream  recycling  bins is too contaminated 
to be recycled at all, and ultimately ends up in landfills.11 Bottle Bills solve this issue. They offer 
the route of least contamination for recycling aluminum, glass and plastic beverage containers; in 
turn thes e containers can be truly recycled, and not wind up in a landfill or  incinerator.  
 
Why Maine Must Increase the Handling Fee:  
 
The benefits of our Bottle Bill are evident, but the system is starting to falter. Our state’s 
container redemption rates have traditionally outperformed those in other states with similar 
systems, yet these numbers are falling. In 2013, Mainers redeemed 90% of the redeemable 
containers, in 2017 this rate went down to 84% which was still one of the highest in the nation, 
and more recently in 2020 this rate had dropped to 76%.12 
 
One of the reasons these rates are dropping is that the redemption centers charged with receiving, 
sorting, and returning the containers to the beverage manufacturers, are suffer ing financial 
hardship.13 The Department of Environmental Protection reported that the number of active 
redemption center licenses had fallen from 374 at then end of 2019, to 328 in July, 2022.14 
Redemption centers have become increasingly strained by the costs of inflation, with no way to raise their income —the statutorily set handling fee of 4.5 cents per container, that beverage 
manufacturers pay such centers for providing these services. 
 
Meanwhile, the expenses of running the redemption centers have soared. Labor costs, payroll 
tax, and workers compensation and insurance have all risen, and these labor items account for 
nearly 50% of redemption center’s total expenses.
15 Other rising costs for redemption centers 
include state redemption license fees, heating oil, rent and property taxes, among others.16 Our 
redemption centers are key to the success of our container redemption program, and they need 
our help. In addition to immediately raising the handling fee to $.0575 cents, this bill wisely 
grants the Department authority to adjust the handling fee after Jan. 1, 2025, and every two years

 thereafter, based on the Consumer Price Index; such a provision ensures that we do not need to 
go through this legislative process every time the economy fluctuates, and redemption centers struggle to sta y open. 
 
LD 134 is a logical measure to meet the needs of redemption centers in today’s economy.  
The Department of Environmental Protection stated in its last Municipal Solid Waste report that 
the container redemption system “is a crucial piece of the recy cling infrastructure throughout the 
state”.
17 We should address the growing demands of inflation and help ensure the sustainability 
of this integral program. CLF wants to see Maine’s recycling system thrive, and thus we support 
LD 134. I urge this Committee to vote LD 134 favorably and act with urgency.
