Re: LD 134, An Act to Increase the Handling Fee for Beverage Containers 
reimbursed to Dealers and Redemption Centers 
My name is Debra Hart, and I am a resident of Manchester, Maine. I am 
presenting these comments in qualified support of LD 134, as amended, 
on behalf of Hannaford Supermarkets. Hannaford has been in the grocery 
business in Maine since the late 1800s and currently has 64 stores in Maine. 
Specifically, we agree that something needs to be done fairly quickly to stem 
the tidal wave that completely overwhelmed the redemption system following 
the pandemic. As you know, Hannaford's stores are supported by the CLYNK 
system, which processes bottles brought into their facilities. 
In Section 2, we take no specific position on what the correct amount of the 
handling fee should be for returned containers. We question whether 
adjusting the reimbursement of handling costs Ô¨Åt be done biannually is 
necessary. 
In Section 3, however, we support the ability for the Department to waive the 
individual container reporting requirements. There needs to be a focus on 
fairness in the bottle sorting process while still allowing a method that will 
ensure fair and accurate accounting methods. We believe this is a reasonable 
approach to dealing with returnable containers. 
Like others, we only saw this new language yesterday. We look forward to 
working with the committee and others as they work to make the beverage 
container law better for all the interested parties.
