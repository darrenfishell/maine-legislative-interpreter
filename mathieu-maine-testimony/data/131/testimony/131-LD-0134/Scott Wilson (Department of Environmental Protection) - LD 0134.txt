Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Scott 
Wilson from the Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management, Division of Materials 
Management, at the Department of Environmental Protection, speaking in favor of the 
original language of L.D. 134. 
Maine's Beverage Container Redemption Program (also known as the “Bottle Bill”) was 
enacted by a people's referendum in November of 1976 and was implemented in 
g January of 1978. The statutory intent of the program has not changed since its

Redemption Centers

enactment in 1976; that beverage containers were a major source of non-degradable 
litter and solid waste in the State and the collection and disposal of this litter and solid 
waste was a financial burden for Maine citizens. The program is designed to meet 
these intentions by creating incentives for consumers to redeem their own containers 
and pick up containers that have been littered through collecting their deposit value, and 
for redemption centers and dealers/retailers to take back containers by means ofa 
handling fee. initiators of Deposit, i.e., the manufacturers or distributors of beverages, 
are required to initiate the deposit, pay the handling fee, and retrieve their containers 
from redemption centers. 
The redemption center is paid for its services through the per container handling fee 
paid by the initiator of the deposit for its costs. This handling fee is set in statute and is 
currently 4.5—cents per container; the fee was last adjusted by the legislature in 2018. 
Since its implementation in 1978, their beverage container universe has expanded 
exponentially. The number of brands, products within those brands, and types of 
containers has dramatically increased. Although a change in the law in 2003 reduced 
the number of “sorts” by allowing manufacturers to co-mingle, there still are currently 
700+ "sorts" , and this number of sorts increase each year with the addition of new 
beverage products. This increase in “sorts” increases the amount of labor necessary to 
operate, but redemption centers are still funded by the same per container handling fee. 
Many redemption centers report having difficulty finding labor at the rate they are able to 
pay that is provided by the handling fee. Additionally, with inflation, rents, utilities, and 
other related operating costs for redemption centers have increased. Given these 
issues, the Department supports a one time increase to the handling fee paid to 
redemption centers in L.D. 134. 
The amendment proposed by the bill sponsor goes beyond the immediate fee increase 
and proposes changes to how containers are inspected for compliance and sorted for

cost allocation to the lODs, which may put traditional redemption centers ata 
competitive disadvantage to “bag drop” systems and increase the chance of fraudulent 
container redemption. It also provides an “automatic ” fee increase, which may not be 
necessary if the bottle redemption program is streamlined and costs to redemption 
centers are reduced through efficiency. These changes above the fee increase are 
significant and should be made only through a more robust review by all the 
stakeholders of the program. The Department opposes this additional language and 
believes it would be included in the stakeholder process suggested in the subsequent 
measure you will hear, LD 972. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
