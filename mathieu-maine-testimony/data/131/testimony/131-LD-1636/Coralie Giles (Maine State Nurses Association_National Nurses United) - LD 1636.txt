LD 1636
I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 1636 on behalf of Maine State Nurses 
Association/National Nurses United (MSNA/NNU), representing 4,000 nurses and 
caregivers across the state of Maine. MSNA/NNU respectfully asks for your “No” 
vote.
Union representation not only improves job quality, pay, benefits, and safe and 
healthy working conditions, it also allows nursing staff to focus on caring for patients 
and to advocate collectively for patients and themselves when necessary. The 
importance of union representation for nurses and patients has never been clearer than
during the Covid-19 pandemic, with studies showing lower Covid-19 patient 
mortality and worker infection rates in unionized workplaces. Recruitment and 
retention are central to ensuring sufficient staffing in health care facilities, so 
protecting workers’ rights to unionize and collective bargain is a critical element in 
protecting both patients and all those who work in patient care.
