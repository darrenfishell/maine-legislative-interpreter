Good afternoon Chairperson Hickman and Chairperson Supica and honorable members of the Veterans and 
Legal Affairs Committee. My name is Susan Meehan, and l am a registry identification cardholder who has 
been involved in Maine cannabis since 2013 as advocate, caregiver, consultant, formulator, patient, and parent 
of a patient - the late Cyndimae Meehan. My passion to protect the program stems from my daughter's valiant 
battle against Dravet Syndrome Epilepsy and how much cannabis helped her to live, love and laugh and enjoy 
her last 3 years with us in our Maine home sledding the hills and swimming in the cold mountain streams. 
l am testifying in favor of LD1691, An Act to Provide Parity in State Energy Rate Relief Payments and Tax 
Exemptions for Maine Cannabis Businesses. 
This industry carried Maine through the pandemic. We were ordered to keep our doors open as â€œessential 
businesses," We did. Yet, we do not.qua|ify for any assistance ever - no small business assistance, no 
federally funded assistance... The industry barely has access to banking. Please fix this also. 
Please be mindful of creating meaningful and sensible laws from which meaningful and sensible rules can be 
derived. Thank you for your time and attention to this very important legal market in Maine. 
Susan Meehan, April 24, 2023 go|denwolf458@qmail.com 207-861-1945
