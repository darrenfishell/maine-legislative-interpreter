Any legal business should not be discriminated against just because of the type of 
legal and/or authorized activity that they partake in. Especially when doing so under 
full compliance while holding the proper licensing. When Maine voted to open up 
Cannabis Businesses in the state it should have also by default been accompanied 
with reasonable and equitable banking, taxation and relief accommodations - the same
as every single other business type has access to. The delay in allotting these 
accommodations indefinitely has hurt the small cannabis businesses in Maine. 
Making it more difficult to stay afloat than it needed to be. I can only imagine it was 
something we thought we wouldnâ€™t need to point out, being something of common 
sense, which is why it may have gone overlooked for so long. But it officially has 
come to our attention that this is an issue and it certainly is time to rectify it. Cannabis
businesses contribute financially to the state in a positive way and fund many things 
through taxes paid. To be afforded the same rights to relief as the other businesses 
operating in the state is a common sense, quality of life measure to be taken. Cannabis
businesses have faced discrimination across the board and it has always been a one 
way road of taking taxes from businesses without giving them a break. It would be a 
great day to see that change.
