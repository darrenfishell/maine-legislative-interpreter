In Opposition to  
 
LD 1691 - An Act to Provide Parity in State Energy Rate Relief Payments and  
Tax Exemptions for Maine Cannabis Businesses  
 
April 24, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1 691 on behalf 
of the Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legisla tive Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills 
of municipal interest.    
Current Maine law in Title 36, Chapter 211, subsection 1760 explicitly states that the exemption 
of sales tax applies to medicine for human beings under a doctor’s  prescription, except for marijuana, now 
referred to as cannabis.  For municipal officials, the law is clear and is not in favor of amending it to allow 
for exempt status at this time.  
In the future, as the federal and state regulations for cannabis are more aligned, the LPC will likely 
reconsider their position. Thank  you for your time and considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
