LD 1691
Good Day Ladies and Gentleman of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.
Today I am testifying in favor of LD# 1691, "An Act to Provide Parity in State 
Energy Rate Relief and Tax Exemptions for Maine Cannabis Businesses".
Cannabis businesses in Maine have had an exponential increase in the cost of their 
electricity while the price of their product(s) has dropped.
Many small businesses are struggling due to high energy costs.
Allowing cannabis businesses to claim sales tax exemption for products used in 
commercial agriculture production will help off set some of the cost of production.
With that said, I ask you to vote in support of LD# 1691.
Thank you for your time,
Amy McFarland
