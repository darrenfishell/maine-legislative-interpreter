Testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry  
By Chelsea Gazillo, American Farmland Trust, New England Policy Manager  
February  13, 202 3 
 
RE: LD 289 - An Act Re quiring the State to Purchase Farms Contaminated  Perfluoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances  
 
Senator Ingwersen , Representative  Pluecker , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry,  
 
My name is Chelsea Gazillo, and I am American Farmland Trust’s New England Policy 
Manager. I appreciate this opportunity to testify on behalf of AFT  regarding LD 289 .  
 
AFT is the nation’s leading conservation organization dedicated to protecting farmland, 
promoting sound farming practices, and keeping farmers on the land. Since its founding in 1980 
by farmers and citizens concerned about the rapid loss of farmland to development, AFT has 
helped protect over 6.5 million acres of farmland and led the way for the adoption of 
conservation practices on millions more. Established in 1985, AFT’s New England office works 
to save the land that sustains us across the region.  
 
Maine’s farmland is vital to our regional economy and food security.  Maine has the most 
agricultural land of any of the six New England states by far  and the largest amount of prime and 
important farmland in New England. According to American Farmland Trust’s Farms Under 
Threat: The State of the States,  1.4% of ME’s agricultural land was converted to urban 
development or low -density residential land use between 2001 and 2016.1 These  17,700 acres of 
land converted is enough to generate $10  million in annual revenue.2  
Perfluoroalkyl  and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are a group of  chemicals that are 
extremely persistent in the environment, including our agricultural soils, and the human body. 
PFAS has been used in many  common household products since the 1950s ranging from food 
packaging to firefighting foam. And while the presence and persistence of PFAS contamination 
is an emerging national issue,  the unfolding information  we currently know  about PFAS  
contamination  in Maine is alarming, especially for farmers whose livelihoods  are connected to 
the land.  
AFT applauds the Maine General Assembly for passing legislation that created the PFAS Fund at 
the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry  (ME DACF)  supported by an 
initial $60 million dollar investment.  The fund will be administered by the M E DACF that is 
currently working with a stakeholder advisory board to create a plan .

 PFAS enters agricultural soils through a variety of means, and Maine farmers will need an 
unprecedented level of support to  address the health and financial impacts of PFAS 
contamination. Maine’s producers need robust  investments in research and remediation so that 
the state will not los e more farmland that is  necessary  for a viable  agriculture sector.  
If passed, LD 289 will set the standard that the state pays a minimum of $20,000 per farmland 
acre when purchasing potentially contaminated farmland. The PFAS Fund Advisory 
Committee’s draft report outlines that does t he following:  
“The advisory committee is presently developing an initial plan to implement programs 
consistent with  7 MRSA § 320 -K, i.e., programs to pay for blood testing and medical 
monitoring; buy and sell land with known PFAS contamination; purchase e quipment, facilities, 
and infrastructure; develop enterprise budgets; replace income; evaluate PFAS testing and data 
management capacity; fund research that supports decision making; support long -term 
monitoring; develop and implement educational programs;  assist with marketing; and engage in 
regional planning.”3 
While AFT  appreciates the intent of LD 289 , we recommend the legislature  delay  passing 
additional legislation to strengthen the program until  DACF releases  its first annual report  to 
address PFAS contaminatio n (per 7 MRSA § 320 -K). In short, responding to the needs of 
farmers with farmland contaminated by PFAS will take a deliberate strategy by the PFAS Fund 
Advisory Committee as the subject matter is complex.  
Please feel free to reach out to me  at cgazillo@farmland.org  or my colleagues at American 
Farmland Trust if you have any questions  about this testimony on LD 289. Thank you for the 
opportunity to submit testimony  on this vital legislation .  
 
American Farmland Trust  is an agricultural non -profit organization with a mission to save the land that sustains us by 
protecting farmland, promoting sound farming practices, an d keeping farmers on the land. AFT is the only national agricultural 
organization that approaches its work in this comprehensive, holistic manner. We recognize the connection between the land, 
forward -looking farming practices, and the farmers who do the w ork.
