Judicial Branch testimony neither for nor against LD 1535, An Act to Advance 
Justice in Sentencing by Amending the Laws Governing the Maine Criminal 
Justice Sentencing Institute and Increasing Funding for Meetings of the 
Institute: 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Julie Finn and I represent the Judicial Branch. I would like to provide 
testimony and comments regarding this bill. 
LD 1535 repeals and replaces the existing statute establishing the Maine Criminal Justice 
Sentencing Institute. The institute has not met in a number of years. 
The Judicial Branch has questions regarding the resources required to convene the 
institute and issue a biennial report. The bill includes an appropriation of $25,000 but it unclear 
what the amount would cover and how it was calculated. The two-day meeting of at least 100 
individuals would require room rental, printing and preparation costs, as Well as mileage for the 
attendees. Staff time for writing and issuing the report would also be need to be covered. 
Thank you for your consideration of the costs associated with reinvigorating the Maine 
Criminal Justice Sentencing Institute.
