Testimony in Support of LD 1306: An Act to Protect Homeowners from Unfair 
Agreements to  Exclusively List Residential Real Estate for Sale  
 
Greeting Senator Curry, Representative Robert and members of the Committee On  
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business . I am Bridget Quinn, 
Associate State Director of Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the nation’s largest n onprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony.  Today, I 
am testifying in suppor t of LD 1306.  
 
LD 1306 protects homeowners from unfair service agreements  by:  
• prohibiting the use of agreements for homeowners to exclusively list their 
residential property for sale  with a real estate brokerage agency or 3rd 
party ; 
• providing remedies to  homeowners affected ; 
• providing strong consumer protection again such predatory housing 
practices.  
 
Older homeowners are not immune from the effects of recent economic trends and the 
resulting stress placed on family budgets. Rising home values are leading to higher 
property taxes. The greater frequency of natural disasters is leading to increases in the cost 
of homeowner’s insurance. And inflation is driving prices higher for most necessities, like 
food, prescription drugs, and utilities. These pric e increases affect older people more 
deeply since they are more likely to be retired and live on a fixed income.  
 
As they search for the supportive services that will enable them to live with dignity and 
independence in their own homes, some are now being enticed with these unfair service 
agreements promising quick cash as a marketing technique. Older adults can be especially 
vulnerable and need extra safeguards in order to be protected from such an unfair, 
deceptive, and abusive practice.  
 
LD 1306 will better support older Mainers who wish to age in place and better protect 
them from these predatory practices. We urge this Committee to vote Ought To Pass on LD 
 
1306. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, If you have questions for me, I can be 
reach ed at bquinn@aarp.org or at 207 -272 -8563.
