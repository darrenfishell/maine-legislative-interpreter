Re: LD 1306 An Act to Protect Homeowners from Unfair Agreements to Exclusively List 
Residential Real Estate for Sale  
 Dear Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and Members of the Committee:   
 I am writing this letter on behalf of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation’s Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation (“ OPOR” ).  The Maine Real E state 
Commission is one of 37 regulatory entities  within OPOR. OPOR is  opposed to LD 1306 as 
drafted , but supportive of the intent behind the bill.   
As drafted, LD 1306 would prohibit any contract in which the owner agrees to list their residential 
proper ty for sale at a future  date; however, this may unintentionally render fair agreements 
unenforceable. There are situations in which a seller may contract for a future listing date for which 
there is no public protection concern. For example, a seller may be unhappy with a current listing agreement and subsequently may enter into a listing agreement with another agency with a start date that commences after the expiration of the current listing or a seller may sign a listing 
agreement for a future date to allow time to prepare the property for sale.  
Our understanding is that the sponsor’s intent is to protect consumers from certain kinds of listing arrangements which tie a consumer  to a listing agreement well beyond the duration of the original 
listing agreement. In some states homeowners have signed real estate listing agreements lasting 40 years.  While believe the intent was to base this bill on the American Land Title Association’s (“ALTA”) model to protect consumers from those types of decades long listing agreements by prohibiting the filing of unfair real estate fee agreements in property records, the bill as drafted is 
not narrowly tailored to achieve that goal.
