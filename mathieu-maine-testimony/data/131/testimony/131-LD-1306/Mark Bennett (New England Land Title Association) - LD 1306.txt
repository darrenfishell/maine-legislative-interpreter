TESTIMONY OF THE NEW ENGLAND  LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION  ON 
L.D. 1306 – “AN ACT TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS FROM UNFAIR AGREEMENTS TO 
EXCLUSIVELY LIST RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FOR SALE”  
BEFORE  THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON INNOV ATION, DEVELOPMENT, 
ECONOMIC ADV ANCEMENT AND BUSINESS  
TUESDAY , APRIL 11, 2023  
AUGUSTA, MAINE  
 
 
Senate Chair Chip Curry, House Chair Tiffany Roberts and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business:  
 
The New England  Land Title Association ( NELTA) appreciates the opportunity to submit 
testimony on L. D. 1306, “An Act to Protect Homeowners from Unfair Agreements to 
Exclusively List Residential Real Estate for Sale.” NELTA supports the passage of L.D. 1306, 
which will protect homeowners from the practice of recording  unfair real estate fee agreemen ts 
in property records.  
 
NELTA is a trade association representing title and settlement agents, abstracters, title searchers, 
real estate attorneys and title underwriters  in Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New 
Hampshire, R hode Island and Vermont . Some r eal estate b rokerage f irms have been offering 
homeowners a p ayment of $300 to $1,000 or more to sign a lon g-term listing  agreement , usually 
for 40 years. In addition  to subjecting the home owner to a penalty of three percent of the 
property value for non -comp liance, it can create  a lien on the property , which add significant 
costs and complications to selling the property as well as refina ncing or accessing a home -equity 
loan. These agre ements not only bind the current home owne r, but al so any su bsequent 
home owners to the provisions of the agreem ent during the 40 years it is in effect.  
 
Already, legislation restricting or limiting the use of these predatory and unfair agreements has 
passed in Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Georgia, Tenne ssee and Idaho with bills currently 
moving in another dozen states. Additionally, five state attorneys general have filed complaints 
regarding these agreements.  
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to submit testimony . We hope you will support the passage 
of L.D. 1306.  
 
Sincerely,
