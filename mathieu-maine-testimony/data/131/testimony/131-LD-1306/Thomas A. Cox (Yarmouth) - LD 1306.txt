Re: LD 1036--An Act to Protect Homeowners from Unfair Agreements to Exclusively 
List Residential Real Estate for Sale 
Dear Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and Members of the Committee: 
I offer this testimony in support of LD 1306. 
After more than thirty years of representing ﬁnancial institutions in private 
practice, I have spent the last 15 years of what might been retirement years to pro bono 
representation of low-income Maine residents facing foreclosures and debt collection 
cases. In addition, I also have provided legal education in these areas of legal work to 
thousands of lawyers across the country in seminars promoted by the National Consumer 
Law Center, the Practicing Law Institute, the American Bar Association, and others. My 
work in this regard has resulted in my receiving awards from the Maine Bar Foundation, 
Boston University School of Law, the State Bar of New York, and the $100,000 Purpose 
Prize from Encore.org. 
LD 1036 is of critical importance in stopping yet another scheme designed to prey 
upon the vulnerabilities of low-income homeowners. This is a scheme that offers them 
seemingly free cash, but which traps them into 40-year contracts encumbering the titles to 
their properties and making them pay thousands of dollars in real estate brokerage 
commissions even when no real estate brokerage services are provided. 
This scheme, operated by a company called MV Realty, has spread across 32 
states so far. In recent months, attorneys general in Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, 
Ohio and North Carolina have sued MV Realty to stop these practices under those states’ 
unfair and deceptive trade practices laws. Within the last 9 months, over 25 state 
legislatures have introduced laws similar to LD 1306 to stop these practices and so far, 
the laws have been ﬁnally enacted in four states and remain in the legislative process in 
the other states. The ﬁrst attachment to this letter (at Page 3) is a list of all of the other 
states where these bills have been introduced. 
Telephone: (207)749-6671 
Fax: (207) 847-4024 
Email: tac@gwi.net
This is the predatory scheme of MV Realty: 
0 Offer a low-income homeowner an unsolicited small cash payment, usually 
less than $1,000 in amount. 
0 Require the homeowner to sign a contract agreeing that, for the next 40 years, 
the homeowner will not list the property for sale with anyone other than MV Realty. 
0 Require the homeowner to pay a 3% commission to MV Realty even if the 
homeowner does not sell the property, but title is transferred due to 
foreclosure, or divorce, the death of the homeowner, due to a real estate tax 
lien foreclosure. 
0 Record a memorandum of the MV Realty contract in the registry of deeds to 
cloud the homeowner ’s title and prevent the homeowner from conveying title 
without paying MV Realty--this also blocks a homeowner from any ability to 
reﬁnance an existing mortgage. 
Maine is forttmate in that these predatory practices have not yet come to Maine, but it is 
only a matter of time before they do come here if we do not enact LD I036 to prevent 
their arrival in Maine. 
Attached to this letter (at Page 18) is one of the numerous news articles describing 
how the MV Realty scheme has damaged low-income homeowners. Also attached (at 
Page 23) is an example of the abusive MV Realty 40-year agreement with a Florida 
homeowner.
