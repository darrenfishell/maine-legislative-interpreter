LD 1770
As someone who has been in the horticulture industry for over 10 years, I am opposed
to LD 1770 as I feel that there are already plenty of requirements in place to monitor, 
and control the application of pesticides. I feel that any additional requirements would
prove to be extremely burdensome to small business owners. The Board of Pesticide 
Control already has requirements for applicators of pesticides, and I see no need to 
make it even more challenging for applicators/business owners to responsibly apply 
pesticides by adding more regulations to a system that has already proven to work. 
Thank you for your time.
