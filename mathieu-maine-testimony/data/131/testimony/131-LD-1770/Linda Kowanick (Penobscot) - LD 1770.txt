LD 1770
As a homeowner I am against LD 1770.  What I do as a homeowner is my private 
business and should not be made public.  If I choose to use pesticides it is my and my 
business only.  This legislation would force applicators to provide my personal 
information which I totally object to!  Please reconsider this legislation of LD 1770.  
Thank you.
