Dear Representatives of the Agricultural Committee,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my written testimony.  I strongly oppose this 
bill once again.  Iâ€™m sure you have heard just about every single angle and point of 
view by now. Manipulation of the the data is a big concern of mine.  Using data from 
reported pesticide sales and spray information can be skewed and misleading graphs 
can be generated to damage our fragile local agricultural economy here in Maine.  
The reporting is cumbersome, expensive and unnecessary given the amount of 
training that we are required to complete to renew our licenses.  Completing all the 
paperwork is going to cause more hardship on the small farmer who does not have an 
administrative team working to fill out these reports. 
Sincerely, Joel Gilbert Berry Fruit Farm
