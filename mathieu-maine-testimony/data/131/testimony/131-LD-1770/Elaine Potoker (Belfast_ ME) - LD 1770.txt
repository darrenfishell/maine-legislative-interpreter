LD 1770
Good morning,
I am a homeowner writing about LD 1770. The creation of an online database for 
pesticide sales and use concerns me as it has the potential to be invasive.  Neither I 
nor my husband want personal information, such as my name and address, to be 
associated with pesticide use and targeted for reasons that are not accurate.  I also 
believe the implications of this bill puts an undue burden and cost on responsible 
pesticide dealers and applicators, forcing them to report confidential information that 
could be made public. 
Thank you for your consideration.  Do not pass LD 1770.
