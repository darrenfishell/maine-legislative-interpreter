LD 1770
I'm a homeowner, and I'm worried about the implications of LD 1770. The creation of
an online database for pesticide sales and use is not only invasive but also costly. The 
proposed measures would put an undue burden on pesticide dealers and applicators, 
forcing them to report confidential information that could be made public. I don't 
want my personal information, such as my name and address, to be associated with 
pesticide use and be easily accessible online. I ask the legislature to listen to the 
concerns of Maine residents and reconsider this legislation
