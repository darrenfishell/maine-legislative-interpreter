LD 1770
I OPPOSE LD 1770!
It is unnecessary, and burdensome to small business and professional, competent 
pesticide applicators who are trained and have administered safe practices and record 
keeping for decades.  The protocols in place with state regulation have been 
proficient, efficient and safe.  This is a completely burdensome, and unnecessary 
record keeping regulation measure.
Thank you for your time
