My name is Paul Peters, I am a fruit grower from Monmouth, I am also an independent crop 
consultant and the Vice President of the Maine Vegetable and Small Fruit Growers Association. 
The members of our association are opposed the proposed legislation. 
1. Growers and state Government do not have the resources to enact the record keeping 
requirements of the bill. 
2. Pesticide use information is proprietary information that is considered Intellectual 
Property. That property should not be available for public access. As a consultant, my clients 
pay me to help them make informed decisions on pesticide use. The information is their 
property, not the public's. 
3. If pesticide use data is provided to the public, it could have a devastating impact in the wrong 
hands. 
4. Maine growers are licensed professionals, who are supported by UMAINE Extension, 
The EPA and the USDA. To suggest that growers are anything less is an insult to 
our Vibrant and successful farm industry. 
I urge you to not support :LD 1770
