LD 1770
I am a Maine homeowner and I strongly oppose LD 1770.  The collection of my 
personal information when using a lawn maintenance company and making that 
information available to the public is an invasion of my privacy.  As structured, this 
bill would impose an undue burden on pesticide applicators, many of which are small 
businesses.  In addition, the passage of this bill would open the door for radical 
elements to demonstrate against businesses and their customers which you should 
want to avoid.
I urge the legislature to vote against this bill and protect our privacy.
