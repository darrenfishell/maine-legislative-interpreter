Senator
Dill,
Representative
O’Neil,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry ,
my
name
is
Paul
Schlein,
I
reside
in
the
T own
of
Arrowsic,
I
was
the
Public
Information
Of ficer
for
the
Maine
Board
of
Pesticides
Control
(BPC
or
Board)
from
2005
to
2013,
and
I
am
writing
to
you
to
strongly
ur ge
your
support
for
the
Amendment
to
LD
2021,
“
An
Act
T o
Collect
Pesticide
Sales
and
Use
Records
for
the
Purpose
of
Providing
Information
to
the
Public.
”
Just
to
be
clear
from
the
start,
it
is
the
amendment
to
LD
2021
that
I
am
asking
you
to
support.
The
amendment
is
essentially
a
revision
of
LD
1599,
“An
Act
T o
Establish
A
Maine
Pesticide
Sales
and
Use
Registry ,”
brought
to
your
committee
in
the
last
session.
Unfortunately ,
and
for
whatever
reason,
there
was
confusion,
miscommunication,
and
misunderstanding
around
the
original
bill,
and
by
the
time
it
was
amended,
it
was
simply
too
late
in
the
process
for
it
to
receive
due
consideration.
However ,
and
fortunately ,
the
amended
LD
2021
has
benefitted
from
testimony
from
all
stakeholders,
as
well
as
comments
from
your
committee,
and,
as
a
result,
has
ef fectively
addressed
all
the
issues
and
concerns
that
were
brought
forward
relating
to
LD
1599.
A
major
point
of
contention
was
that
of
the
confidentiality
of
the
information
entered
into
the
database,
and
this
has
been
very
clearly
addressed.
T wo
other
major
sticking
points
relating
to
LD
1599—the
purported
extreme
cost
and
dif ficulty
of
creating
an
online
database—have
already
been
very
nicely
taken
care
of
by
the
BPC
in
the
time
since
the
last
session,
and,
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
extreme
cost
or
dif ficulty ,
as
noted
in
the
Board’ s
Report
to
the
130th
Maine
State
Legislature
on
LD
524
(pages
10
and
12,
https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/7755
).
In
fact,
on
a
limited
basis,
this
has
already
been
put
into
action
by
the
BPC
through
its
Online
Portal:
https://www .maine.gov/dacf/php/pesticides/pega.shtml
.
One
point
of
clarification,
critical
to
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
LD
2021,
is
that
entering
information
into
an
online
database
would
mean
more
work
for
the
regulated
community .
This
is
clearly
and
irrefutably
incorrect:
pesticide
applicators
already
have
to
fill
out
on
paper
a
daily
Pesticide
Applicator
Log
(
https://www .maine.gov/dacf/php/pesticides/documents2/WPS%20Forms/logbook.pdf
),
and
the
only
change
with
LD
2021
will
be
that
the
exact
same
information
will
instead
be
entered
into
a
very
accommodating
online
form.
By
all
standards
today ,
this
will,
in
fact,
be
easier
and
less
burdensome
than
writing
it
out
on
paper .
Further ,
and
the
last
point
I
would
like
to
make,
is
that
the
original
LD
2021
proposes
that
the
Annual
Summary
Report
required
by
the
BPC
(already
shown
in
the
preceding
link),
will
provide
the
necessary
information
on
sales
and
use.
V ery
simply ,
and
I
ask
you
to
compare
the
two,
it
very
clearly
will
not.
Most
interesting
is
that,
with
the
move
to
online
entry ,
this
form
will
no
longer
be
needed,
as
the
necessary
information
can
be
easily
extracted
from
the
resulting
database—a
very
significant
savings
for
pesticide
applicators.
Consider
how
much
time
is
needed
to
compile
the
information
for
a
year ’ s
worth
of
daily
forms,
even
just
for
one
applicator ,
let
alone
firms
with
many
applicators.
In
view
of
the
fact
the
amended
LD
2021
is
a
new
version
of
LD
1599,
my
testimony
submitted
for
LD
1599
still
stands—word
for
word,
especially
considering
that
at
least
one
critical
recommendation
has
already
come
to
pass
(online
data
entry),
I
am
hereby
resubmitting
that
testimony ,
below ,
for
your
review ,
and
ask
that
you
give
it
a
fresh
look,
in
your
consideration
of
LD
2021.
It
tells
the
story
and
provides
the
basis
for
why
we
must
be
able
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
Maine,
in
the
22
years
since
Maine
T itle
22,
Chapter
258,
§1471-X
was
enacted
(
https://www .mainelegislature.or g/legis/statutes/22/title22sec1471-X.html
),
has
achieved
the
critical
goal
of
reducing
reliance
on
pesticides.
Respectfully
submitted,
Paul
Schlein
Arrowsic,

“
An

Sales
and

Registry .
”
T wenty-four
years
ago,
what
is
now
Maine
T itle
22,
Chapter
258,
§1471-X
was
enacted:
“
State
policy;
public
and
private
initiatives
to
minimize
reliance
on
pesticides.
It
is
the
policy
of
the
State
to
work
to
find
ways
to
use
the
minimum
amount
of
pesticides
needed
to
effectively
contr ol
tar geted
pests
in
all
ar eas
of
application.
The
agencies
of
the
State
involved
in
the
r egulation
or
use
of
pesticides
shall
pr omote
the
principles
and
the
implementation
of
integrated
pest
management
and
other
science-based
technology
to
minimize
r eliance
on
pesticides
while
r ecognizing
that
outbr eaks
of
disease,
insects
and
other
pests
will
necessitate
fluctuations
in
pesticide
use.
These
agencies,
in
cooperation
with
private
inter est
gr oups,
shall
work
to
educate
pesticide
users
and
the
general
public
in
the
pr oper
use
of
pesticides
and
to
determine
other
actions
needed
to
accomplish
the
state
policy .”
1
At
the
same
time,
§1471-M,
sub-§7
was
enacted:
“
Data
collection;
annual
report.
The
boar d
shall
implement
a
system
of
r ecor d
keeping,
r eporting,
data
collection
and
analysis
that
pr ovides
information
on
the
quantity
of
pr oduct
and
brand
names
of
pesticides
sold.
The
boar d,
in
cooperation
with
the
University
of
Maine
Cooperative
Extension
Service,
shall
study
ways
to
impr ove
pesticide
information
data
bases
and
to
optimize
the
useful
analysis
of
r eported
information.
No
later
than
October
1,
1998,
and
each
year
ther eafter ,
the
boar d
shall
publish
an
annual
pesticides
r eport
containing
the
quantity
of
pr oduct,
sorted
by
the
name
and
United
States
Envir onmental
Pr otection
Agency
r egistration
number ,
of
all
pesticides
sold
in
the
prior
year ,
with
the
data
further
sorted
by
sector
of
use
wher ever
possible.”
1 , 2
Logically ,
without
§1471-M,
sub-§7,
how
could
it
be
determined
whether
pesticide
use
was
decreasing
or
increasing?
The
BPC
nobly
attempted
to
collect
data,
analyze
it,
and
report
on
it,
as
required.
However ,
as
the
year
2000
BPC
report
indicates
in
detail,
3
as
well
as
the
BPC
201 1
GEA
Program
Evaluation
Report,
the
reporting
requirement
was
short-lived.
Excerpts
from
the
latter
report
explain
the
history:
“.
.
.A
separate
pr ovision
of
this
legislation
dir ected
the
Boar d
to
publish
an
annual
r eport
on
pesticide
sales
and
use
data
so
ther e
could
be
some
determination
if
the
new
policy
was
r esulting
in
decr eased
pesticide
use.
No
funds
or
positions
wer e
pr ovided
to
pr oduce
these
r eports.
.
.
.The
[ACF
Committee’ s]
discussion
during
[the
first
BPC
GEA
Program
Evaluation
Review
in
2000]
focused
on
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
useful,
r eliable
information
on
pesticide
use
in
the
state.
After
studying
the
issue,
the
Boar d
r eported
back
to
the
Committee
in
2002
and
pr esented
several
r ecommendations
for
change.
These
included
r equiring
all
in-state
dealers
to
r eport
their
pesticides
sales
and
all
commer cial
agricultural
pr oducers
to
r eport
their
pesticide
use
on
an
annual
basis.
The
Committee
agr eed
the
curr ent
r eports
wer e
of
little
value,
but
did
not
take
any
action
to
r equir e
additional
gr oups
to
r eport
or
to
extend
the
r equir ement
for
annual
r eports
of
incomplete
data.”
4
As
the
current
§1471-M,
sub-§7
indicates,
2002
was
the
last
year
any
reporting
was
required.
5
§1471-X
remains
unchanged—and
unsupported.
6
Since
2002,
with
only
one
exception,
no
new
attempt
has
been
made
to
gather
pesticide
sales
and/or
usage
data
in
a
comprehensive
manner ,
as
a
way
to
determine
the
extent
of
pesticide
use
in
Maine.
The
exception
was
in
201 1,
when
Board
staf f
gathered
all
available
data
on
pesticides
and
produced
a
graph
that
indicated
a
dramatic
700%
increase
of
home-use
pesticides
distributed
into
Maine
between
2005
and
201 1.
That
graph
appears
below ,
as
it
is
evidently
no
longer
posted
on
the
Board's
website.
At
the
December
18,
2015,
Board
meeting,
staf f
were
questioned
about
the
graph,
and
responded
as
follows:
“The
700%
incr ease
in
pesticide
sales
originates
fr om
a
graph
on
www .yar dscaping.or g
[no
longer
posted
on
this
site,
see
above]
.
Those
numbers
may
be
inexact
because
the
data
collected
is
distribution
data
so
it
does
not
r eport
the
quantity
that
is
actually
sold.
The
data
fr om
pesticide
application
companies
should
be
fairly
accurate.
The
upwar d
tr end
is
r eliable.
The
Boar d
now
r eceives
a
lar ger
per centage
of
these
r eports
than
in
the
past.
Ther e
ar e
mor e
lawn
and
landscape
companies
out
ther e
and
mor e
people
hiring
them.”
7
So
where
does
all
this
leave
us
in
2021?
The
State
of
Maine
has
the
most
admirable
policy
of
reducing
reliance
on
pesticides,
but
no
way
to
accurately
gauge
that
this
is
occurring.
Unfortunately ,
all
that
leaves
is
a
rather
hollow
policy .
However ,
and
fortunately ,
with
the
passage
of
24
years,
technology
has
made
tremendous
advances
in
computer
science
and
online
access
to
information,
which
should
address
and
solve
all
the
problems
that
brought
the
§1471-M,
sub-§7
reporting
to
an
abrupt
end
in
2002.

a
phased-in
plan,
with
step-by-step
detail
and
structure,
including
which
information
to
include
and
when
to
start,
to
begin
work
on
the
pesticides
sales
and
use
registry .
It
provides
for
primary ,
direct-from-the-source
data,
eliminating
the
endless,
previously
required,
labor -intensive
data
entry
from
incomplete
sources
that,
in
the
end,
did
not
provide
the
desired
result.
W ith
the
existing
online
portal
that
the
BPC
has
already
developed,
for
product
registration,
licensing,
and
recertification,
8
that
applicators
and
companies
are
already
familiar
with,
it
may
very
well
be
that
much
of
the
work
has
already
been
done,
and
all
that
is
needed
is
to
add
a
new
module
and
functionality
for
this
new
use.
It

may
also
be
that,
with
this
new
functionality ,
the
daily
and
annual
reporting
requirements
for
applicators
and
companies
of
the
Board’ s
Chapter
50
9
will
have
been,
or
can
be,
incorporated
into
the
new
database,
ending
in
an
overall
streamlined,
more
ef ficient
and
precise
reporting
process.
Should
a
model
and
technical
assistance
be
needed,
the
State
of
California’ s
Pesticide
Use
Reporting
database
is
a
prime
example
of
what
has
been,
and
what
can
be,
accomplished.

If
cost
is
a
consideration,
the
BPC
2020
budget
1 1
lists
income
of
more
than
$2
million
in
pesticide
registration
fees,
with,
unless
there
has
been
a
change
from
when
I
was
there,
a
lar ge
percentage
taken
to
fund
programs
and
positions
entirely
unrelated
to
the
business
and
mission
of
the
BPC.
If
this
is
not
suf ficient
to
justify
support
for
this
bill,
I
would
further
ask
the
ACF
to
consider
the
reasons
for
wanting
to
reduce
unnecessary
pesticide
use,
and
the
potential
true
cost
to
human
health
and
the
environment,
if
it
turns
out
that
Maine
is
not
where
it
hopes
to
be
regarding
§1471-X.
In
closing,
this
is
the
perfect
time
for
the
ACF
Committee
to
pick
up
where
it
left
of f
21
years
ago,
and
vote
in
favor
of
LD
1599,
to
create
the
most-needed
database,
to
gather
the
necessary
information
to
show
Maine
is
on
track
with
pesticide
reduction,
or ,
if
we
all
need
to
work
harder
to
accomplish
this.
Please
vote
OTP
on
this
important
bill.
Respectfully
submitted,
Paul
Schlein
Arrowsic,
Maine
