LD 1770
We are concerned about the proposed LD 1770 which would require pesticide 
applicators to report the location where they applied pesticides. That sounds like a 
grievous overreach of government authority. The impetus for the proposed law is 
understandable in the wake of the recent PFAS debacle, but this seems like a huge 
overreaction. We doubt the State is doing enough now to manage the current laws 
governing pesticide sales and use.
If this law were to be enacted, it would create an entirely new online data base. Who 
is going to ensure confidentiality? Who is going to pay for the additional staff and 
resources for the Board of Pesticides and the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry to keep track of reporting requirements when State funds 
are always tight and labor hard to recruit? It will be the taxpayers who pay. And, the 
same taxpayers—home owners, farmers, businesses—would be shouldering the cost 
when pesticide applicators up their charges to cover THEIR additional staff and 
resources to comply. 
Reporting monthly on pesticide application sites at the level of detail required by LD 
1770 would be overly burdensome on pesticide dealers and applicators, the State 
agencies which manage pesticide sales and use, and the taxpayer.
We are deeply centered about the potential negative consequences of LD 1770, and 
we urge you to vote NO on LD 1770.
