I strongly oppose LD 1770.  In these times of rampant invasions of privacy, it is 
highly objectionable that this proposed legislation would force pesticide applicators to
disclose their clientsâ€™ personal and private information such the addresses of where 
products were applied. Please do not pass this bill.
