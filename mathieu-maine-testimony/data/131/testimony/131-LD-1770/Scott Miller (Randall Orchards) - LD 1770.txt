Greetings, 
 
The larger issue here, as I see it, is where do we want our food coming from? Who do we want to 
depend on for our food supply? A Representativeâ€™s suggestion that I retire if the regulations 
become too burdensome is not unrealistic. At 64 the workload has diminished a bit. The reward 
of a modest paycheck and knowing people will be fed by the results of our labors is enough to 
keep going. However, there is not a line of people clamoring to take my place.  
 
Please keep in mind that this legislation is not the only regulation we contend with. While larger 
operations may have office staff, many of us do not. Time spent doing paperwork is time not 
spent in the orchard Please fund the university of Maine to help us be better farmers instead of 
funding more staff at the board of Pesticides control to manage burdensome over regulation. 
 
Maine farmland is prime real estate. Readily buildable land and /or beautiful views make it more 
valuable for development than farming. There are very real-world consequences to the overall 
load of burdensome over regulation. Please consider this in your deliberations. 
 
Respectfully,
