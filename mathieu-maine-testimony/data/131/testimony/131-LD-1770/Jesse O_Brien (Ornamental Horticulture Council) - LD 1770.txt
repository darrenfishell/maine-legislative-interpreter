Ornamental Horticulture Council 
Jesse O'Brien, Spokesperson 
Opposed to LD 1770 
"An Act to Improve Pesticides Sales and Use Data Collection and Accessibility by 
the State" 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the joint committee 
on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Jesse O'Brien, l am from 
Portland and lam the spokesperson of Ornamental Horticulture Council, OHC. We 
consist of greenhouses, arborists, garden centers, landscapers, Christmas Tree 
Growers, Golf Course Superintendents and Turf Ca re operators. We have 
businesses throughout the State and employ thousands of people and we help 
keep suburban and urban areas green and growing. 
Our industries are very concerned with the over use and misuse of any pesticide. 
We practice the State of Maine policy of minimizing the use of pesticides as 
referenced in the summary of LD 1770. This policy is called Integrated Pest 
Management, IPM. We have some concerns with LD 1770. 
0 The absence of IPM, the State Policy, as an environmentally sound 
approach of managing pests 
0 Sec. 4 no. 3 Conﬁdential Information. The deﬁnition seems to be arbitrary 
0 Sec. 6 no 1. Reporting Regarding Pesticides Sales and Use Rates, focuses 
on only sales and uses of pesticides it does not provide context for the 
applications, such as Active Ingredient, pest outbreaks, certain weather 
conditions or any other measure of IPM 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak today
