Ornamental Horticulture Council of Me.
LD 1770
Phil Roberts Broadway Gardens, South Portland -  As a Licensed Private Applicator 
and Board Member of the Ornamental Horticulture Council of Maine  I am totally 
against LD1770; I t creates additional burdensome regulations that will create more 
confusion between  the general population  and applicators.  The public will be 
questioning applications  constantly due to their lack of understanding ; We already 
have a good check  and balance system with record keeping already   in use  with the 
Board of Pesticide Control.   -  Generally speaking The Maine BPC does a good job 
enforcing regulations as needed,   We have had  little to no  significant issues  over 
the years under our  current system ; All the records are there if you need to access 
them : You know the old saying "if it aint broke dont fix it"    This proposed  bill 
could  possibly scare professionals   into not  reporting applications in certain  
situations too   sincerely  Philip
