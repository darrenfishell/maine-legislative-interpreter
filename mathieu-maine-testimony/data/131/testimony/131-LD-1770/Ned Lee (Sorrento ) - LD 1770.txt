LD 1770
As all products applied are already registered and approved for use by the US 
Environmental Protection Agency and pesticide applicators are already licensed by 
The State of Maine, the passage of LD 1770 is not only wasteful but would squander 
the limited available resources best used elsewhere.  Additionally, provisions of LD 
1770 would make personal information available to the public infringing on 
individuals rights and endangering their privacy and possibly safety.  I would doubt 
passage of this legislation would hold up in court if challenged.
