LD 1770
As a homeowner, I strongly oppose LD 1770. I don’t want my personal information 
and what I do on my personal property to be publicly available. This legislation would
force applicators to submit addresses where products were applied, which could be 
made public. I don’t want my address to be associated with pesticide use and be 
subject to potential harassment or negative attention. This would be an invasion of my
privacy and I urge the legislature to reconsider this bill.
