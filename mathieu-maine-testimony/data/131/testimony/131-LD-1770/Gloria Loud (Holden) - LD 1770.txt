I believe this is an unnecessary invasion of privacy. Because it will cause much more 
paperwork, it will cause landscapers to charge the customer more. I spray for ticks, 
and there is no need to make that public. This seems to be due to the PFAS issue, 
Insecticides are a necessary part of of our lives. We must control ticks, etc.
