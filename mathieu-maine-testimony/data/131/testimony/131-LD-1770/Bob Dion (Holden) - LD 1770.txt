LD 1770
I'm a homeowner.  The personal information to be collected via passage of LD1770 
no doubt will be assembled in a data base and eventually made available for public 
consumption despite guarantees to the contrary.  If passed two things will happen for 
sure.  My privacy will suffer another blow to be violated by those whose agenda 
would be not in agreement with such lawn treatment applications.  Two, the time, 
administrative and cost burdens placed on certain Maine small businesses would 
adversely effect their efficiency and profitability in a time when scarce resources are 
more the norm.  Those costs would have to be passed on to customers to remain 
viable. Or, if not, people would have to be let go.  It appears too little thinking has 
gone into this proposed legislation as per usual.  Finally, I don't want my personal 
information to be associated with pesticide use and easily accessible online.  This 
proposed legislation needs to be reconsidered.  Thank you.
