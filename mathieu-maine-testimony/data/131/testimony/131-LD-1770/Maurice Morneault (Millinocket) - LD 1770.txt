LD 1770
LD 1770 is a threat to my privacy as a homeowner, and I urge the legislature to vote 
against it. The creation of an online pesticide sales and use database would be a costly
endeavor that would require additional staff and resources. Moreover, the proposed 
measures would put an undue burden on pesticide dealers and applicators. They 
would be forced to report confidential information that could be made public, which 
would discourage the use of pesticides and negatively impact their business. As a 
Maine resident, I don't want my personal information and what I do on my property to
be publicly available. I urge the legislature to vote against this bill and protect the 
privacy of Maine residents.
