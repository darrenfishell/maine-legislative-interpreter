Re: LD 1770
Dear Legislators:
As a homeowner, I strongly oppose LD 1770.  I don’t want my personal 
information nor my household’s activities to be publicly available.  This legislation 
would force qpplicators to submit addresses where their products are applied.  This 
information, in turn, could be made public, and my household could be the subject of 
potential harassment or negative attention.  The use of this information in this way 
would be an invasion of my privacy, which I will not tolerate.
An example of how personal information in government hands was compromised 
can be seen in Suffolk County, NY, where, very recently, the County’s municipal 
records were hacked – for all 1.4 million residents!  These schemes know no bounds, 
and unless Maine has “super cyber-security”, no one’s information is safe.
Finally, for my personal health, it is necessary to have my property treated with 
pesticides.  I have had several bouts with Lyme Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted 
Fever, common tick-bourne diseases in Maine which can have debilitating physical 
effects.   If I am to enjoy ANY outdoor activities in my yard, then my property must 
be treated regularly.  
I urge the Legislature to vote against this bill.
Sincerely,
Barbara & Thomas
