LD 1770 makes my head spin.  The already stretched-thin Board of Pesticides Control
(BPC) is to collect and collate data from all pesticide vendors catering to Maine 
clients monthly.  Yearly, they are directed to collect reams of additional data from 
anyone in the State using these pesticides, which have already been accounted for 
once, and then make all this information accessible to the public?  Who in the public 
domain will use this information and for what purpose? All pesticides sold in the 
State must be registered and have gone through rigorous testing.  Their labels direct 
how, when, where, and by whom they may be used.  The BPC has inspectors who 
check to be sure those of us who use them do so legally (i.e. are properly licensed and
follow the labels.)  Lately, inspections have not been as frequent because, as I already 
mentioned, the BPC is stretched thin.
Instead of taking issue, once again, with those legally applying pest and disease 
control materials, wouldnâ€™t it make more sense to put the extra money, and there will 
need to be a lot of it if this bill passes, towards staffing the UMaine Cooperative 
Extension Service to its pre-pandemic levels and having them expand their excellent 
educational efforts around pesticide use?
I will try to get to Augusta on Monday (talk about short notice!) but this will have to 
do for now.  Please to not move this bill forward.  There are much better uses for the 
funds that would be tied up in its implementation.
