LD 1770
As a homeowner, I strongly oppose LD1770.  I do not want my personal information 
and information about activity on my property to be publically available.  This 
legislation would require applicators to submit addresses where products are applied, 
which could be made public.  I do not want my name, address and other personal 
information to be associated with pesticide application and be subject to potential 
harassment and negative attention.  This is an invasion of my privacy and I urge the 
legislature to reconsider this bill.
