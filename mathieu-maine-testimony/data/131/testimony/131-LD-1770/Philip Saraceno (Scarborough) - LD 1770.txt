 Good Morning and Thank you for your service to our state.  In reading your proposed
bill I cannot help but feel we are continuing to put a burden one of the most important
segments of our state, The Small Business Owner.  It seems that every time there is a 
new regulation, restriction or thought as to how to protect someone or something it 
bring more stress on our Small Business Owners.  Things roll downhill and they seem
to catch all.  
Your group has proposed many ways to help protect our citizens and our state. Many 
times they are great ideas in theory, but when we take a common sense view, the cost 
is higher than the end result.  Do we regulate, restrict or eliminate ways of our citizens
do business,  to where we have no one to grow our foods, our plants that we need to 
survive or beautify our state .  Are we truly using products that are more harmful 
today than they were 30,50, 80 years ago, or are we just trying to find a cause to say 
we are fighting for.    
I deal with small business owners everyday and they are struggling to find products, 
find employees and fight those that want to end the way they do business.  It is 
happening everyday, and eventually the ball rolling down hill into their laps will be 
enough to where it is not worth being in business any further.
I ask you to not pass this bill that makes this important class of our citizens question 
where it is worth being in business.
Sincerely,
Philip Saraceno
