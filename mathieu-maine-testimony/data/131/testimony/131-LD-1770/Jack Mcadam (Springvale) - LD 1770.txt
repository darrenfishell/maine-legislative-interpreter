LD 1770 An Act to Improve Pesticides Sales and Use Data Collection and, Accessibility by the State 
 
 A certified applicator or commercial agricultural producer shall keep and maintain records of the 
purchase and use of pesticides for reporting purposes. These records must include the names of all 
pesticide product dealers from which pesticides were purchased, the address where the pesticides were 
applied, the names of the pesticides, the quantity purchased and applied, the date the pesticides were 
applied and the United States Environmental Protection Agency registration number. 
 
Why do we need this? We are required by the Board of Pesticide Control (BPC) to track these 
pesticides. When we get a pesticide delivery we have to pay for it at some point so we have a record of 
that purchase. Every time a pesticide is used we must post specific information according to Worker 
Protection Standards (WPS) so that our workers are aware of the Re-Entry Interval (REI) and the 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required to work on the crop that was sprayed. We do NOT allow 
them to work on a sprayed crop until the REI has expired. Our family lives on the farm so we are very 
careful on what and when we spray. 
 
The bill specifies that information submitted to the board is public information. 
 
If a customer asks us what we have sprayed on our crops we will show them our spray records. Isn’t 
this a requirement? If a person looks up what we sprayed will they be able to determine why we used 
that pesticide? Wouldn’t it be better if they talked directly to the farmer? 
 
If you go ahead with this bill it would benefit the pesticide user if they could enter the information you 
are looking for into an online portal and be able to save and print the records that are required by WPS. 
It would help with redundancy.
