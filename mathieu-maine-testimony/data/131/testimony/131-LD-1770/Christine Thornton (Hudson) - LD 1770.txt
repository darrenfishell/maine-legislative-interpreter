I do not wish information about my choice of pesticides used on my property to be 
public knowledge, and I also am concerned that this is yet another program that our 
taxes will be wasted on more State bureaucracy when we can’t even pay teachers or 
plow drivers at a rate that attracts personnel. It’s about time legislators stopped trying 
to appease a few by requiring overly burdensome record keeping and oversight for 
people who already have done the actual research into how to perform their services 
in a way Maine people desire.
