LD 1770
I wish to comment on ld1770. I find it hard to believe that this bill would  have a 
hearing set without stakeholders being given proper advance notice to make their 
feelings known. I request that this hearing be delayed giving us an opportunity to 
testify to the many hardships this legislation would impose upon us.
