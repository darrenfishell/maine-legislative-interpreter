Sena tor Baile y, Represen tative Perry and member s of the Join t Standing Commit tee on HealthCoverage, Insur ance and Financial Ser vices, m y name is Nic ole Cleg g and I ser ve as the Chie fStrategy and Impact Of ficer a t Planned P arenthood of Northern Ne w England and I am pleasedto submit t estimon y neither f or nor ag ainst LD 351.
At PPNNE, our mission is t o expand access t o contracep tion and r educe r eproductiv e healthcare disparities. T o tha t end, Planned P arenthood F eder al of Americ a is part of theFree the PillCoalition, joining do zens of other or ganizations t oconduct r esear ch andsupportover-the-c ounter (O TC) birth c ontrol pills tha t are affordable, fully c overed b y insur ance, andavailable t o people of all ag es.Our participa tionis dict ated b y a belie f tha t the decision t o bringbirth c ontrol over-the-c ounter should be le ft to the medic al experts and scien tists at the FD A.The FD A has the sole ability t o de termine whe ther a c ontracep tive product mee ts the rig oroussafety, quality and e fficacy s tandar ds for the o ver-the-c ounter use.
Making birth c ontrol pills and  hormonal pa tches a vailable o ver-the-c ounter thr ough FD Aappr oval is one op tion f or pr egnancy pr evention, but w e kno w finding the righ t form of birthcontrol is s till a major barrier t o access f or man y people, so addr essing this ob stacle is a k eycomponen t for an y success ful policy tha t expands access.
In evalua ting this bill, w e ask ed the ques tions: who bene fits; is this the bes t policy f or expandingaccess within this popula tion; and does the bill r eflect bes t medic al pr actices. lt is unclear t o methat LD 351 will r esult in its in tended g oal of e xpanding access t o birth c ontrol. If the purpose isto impr ove access f or people with e xisting pr escrip tions, ther e are be tter w ays to do this,including the r emo val of s tep ther apy requir emen ts for contracep tive coverage. The MaineLegisla ture passed legisla tion las t year t o addr ess s tep ther apy in priv ate insur ance and willconsider another bill this session t o remo ve similar r estrictions in MaineCar e. Further the billfalls short of mee ting bes t practices f or pr escribing and dispensing birth c ontrol.
I would flag a number of issues within the t ext of the bill tha t preclude an y support fr om ourorganization.1.It is not clear wh y the bill applies t o only cert ain me thods of c ontracep tives appr oved b ythe FD A and e xcludes other s (for example NUV Aring).2.The policy only applies v ery narr owly t o people who ma y bec ome pr egnan t withevidence of a pr evious pr escrip tion. Ther e is no applic able time frame f or theprescrip tion nor is ther e languag e tha t stipula tes tha t the me thod pr escribed is themethod the pharmacis t could dispense. This is c onfusing and does not r eflect bes tmedic al pr actice. The r eality is tha t ther e are a number of c ontra indic ations f or cert ainmethods of hormonal c ontracep tion including ag e, weigh t, blood pr essur e, choles terol,
etc. tha t can chang e overtime. A pr escrip tion tha t was writ ten ten years ago ma y not bethe righ t prescrip tion f or someone no w.3.The tr aining r equir emen t does not manda te tha t bes t medic al pr actices be adher ed tofor participa ting pharmacis ts.4.The tr aining is limit ed to the tw o me thods lis ted (or al contracep tives, of which ther e arehundr eds of f ormularies and the pa tch) which is wholly insuf ficien t. Training pr ogramsand c ounseling mus t cover all me thods of birth c ontrol including e fficacy r ates to ensur ethat the per son is making a fully in formed decision tha t is mos t appr opria te for theirhealth and lif e planning. Ther e are man y dif ferent kinds of birth c ontrol and no onemethod will w ork f or every per son a t every stage of lif e. The mos t effectiv e forms ofbirth c ontrol, lik e lUDs and implan ts, requir e the insertion b y a tr ained health c areprovider . Excluding in forma tion and c ounseling about these me thods in terferes ininformed medic al decision-making.5.The r eferral requir emen t is v ague and does not acc ount for people who do not ha ve aregular pr actitioner .6.Ther e is no r eference t o counseling , quality of c ounseling , priv acy of c ounseling f or asomeone seeking birth c ontrol, nor is ther e an y requir emen t to scr een f or other riskfactors including ag e, se xually tr ansmit ted in fections, se xual assault, e tc.7.Ther e is no c onsult ation with s takeholder s or medic al experts in de velopmen t of theregula tions and tr aining t ools. The r egula tions de veloped in the other s tates w eresubstantive, requir ed signific ant commitmen t from s takeholder gr oups and time t odevelop a pr ogram tha t insur ed high quality c are.
For a policy lik e this t o be success ful, y ou need buy -in fr om the s takeholder s including clinicians,sexual and r eproductiv e health e xperts and pharmacis ts who ar e commit ted to investing thetime and r esour ces t o create a pr ogram tha t ensur es the highes t quality of in forma tion f orpeople t o mak e the bes t decision f or their health and futur e. This bill, as dr afted, f alls short ofthat standar d.
As men tioned earlier , if the in tention of this legisla tion is t o expand access t o birth c ontrol for allMainer s then I w ould r ecommend the r emo val of s tep ther apy requir emen ts for birth c ontrolcoverage tha t curr ently e xist in MaineCar e coverage which w ould enable medic al pr ofessionalsto be tter ma tch birth c ontrol op tions t o the needs of per sons desiring t o prevent pregnancy . Ifthe in tention is t o support o ver the-c ounter status f or cert ain me thods of birth c ontrol, l w ouldsuggest joining PPF A and the W orking Gr oup in its pe tition t o the FD A. These ar e policies wher ea success ful out come is clear . If the in tention is t o grant pharmacis ts pr escribing authority f or arange of birth c ontrol me thods, I w ould sug gest developing a pr ogram tha t reflects bes tpractices.
Thank y ou for your time and c onsider ation.
