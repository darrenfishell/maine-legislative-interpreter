Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Committee, my name is Jeri 
Betts and I am a Regulatory Board Manager with the Office of Professional and Occupational 
Regulation (OPOR). I am here to speak neither for nor against LD 1 on behalf of OPOR. 
This bill proposes to authorize pharmacists to prescribe and dispense hormonal contraceptive 
patches and self-administered oral hormonal contraceptives to a person who has evidence ofa 
previous prescription from a practitioner for a hormonal contraceptive patch or self-administered 
oral hormonal contraceptive. 
We note the following for your consideration: 
0 The bill title indicates that its goal is to make certain contraceptives available “over the 
counter. ” We note that the bill language does not make these medications available “over 
the counter” but rather expands the pharmacist ’s authority to prescribe and dispense these 
types of contraceptives to a person who has evidence of a previous prescription. “Over-the- 
counter” is a term that implies no prescription is required. 
0 We note that the bill does not amend the deﬁnition of practice of pharmacy to include the 
authority of a pharmacist to prescribe this contraception. The pharmacist scope of practice 
was amended to enable the administration of vaccines and the prescribing, dispensing and 
administering of HIV drugs. (32 M.R.S. §§ 13786-E, 13702-A(28)). The practice of

pharmacy was not amended to include the prescribing of naloxone hydrochloride which is 
authorized by 32 M.R.S. § 13815. 
The bill requires a pharmacist to ﬁrst complete a board-approved training program related to 
prescribing hormonal contraceptive patches and self-administered oral hormonal 
contraceptives. We are unaware of available training programs. Assuming there are 
training programs available that will be acceptable to the Board, the bill is silent as to 
whether it would be expected that the Board track those pharmacists who complete the 
approved training. The bill also does not provide whether the Board would notate in some 
way for the public that a particular licensee had completed the training. 
By comparison, the law that authorized a pharmacist to administer certain drugs or vaccines 
(PL. 2009. c. 308), required evidence of the training to be submitted to the Board and the 
Board to issue a “certiﬁcate of administration, ” a credential that is made available to the 
public in addition to a pharmacist ’s license status. . 
The bill requires the Board to adopt rules to establish standard procedures for the 
prescribing of hormonal contraceptive patches and self-administered oral hormonal 
contraceptives by pharmacists. We discourage mandatory rulemaking. This Board already 
has several large rulemaking items on its agenda (and more expected to be added this 
session.) If rules are mandatory, the intent of the law likely could not be implemented for 
over a year or more given the board’s current rulemaking commitments and the time it takes 
for a proposed rule to make its way through the APA process. 
Thank you for your time and I will be happy to answer your questions now or at the work 
session.
