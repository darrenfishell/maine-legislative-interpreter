TESTIMONY OF THE MAINE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION 
In Support Of 
LD 129 — Resolve, to Direct the University of Maine System to Study the Feasibility of 
Establishing a Public Allopathic Medical School in Penobscot County 
February 2, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Sally Weiss and I am here on behalf of the Maine Hospital Association. 
I am here today to express our support for LD 129. 
MHA represents Maine’s 36 private acute care, psychiatric, and rehabilitation hospitals. 
Multiple studies have examined the correlation between practice locations with where physicians 
graduated from medical school. In particular, it has been documented that rural education is 
associated with increased likelihood of practicing in rural communities. ‘ Furthermore, a paper 
published in 2014 identiﬁed that 22% of all Maine’s physicians graduated from one of three 
medical schools afﬁliated with Maine Medical Center (University of New England College of 
Osteopathic Medicine [UNECOM], University of Vermont [UVM] or Tufts University School of 
Medicine), and nearly 10% of those graduated from the only medical school in Maine 
(UNECOM).2 What this demonstrates is the power of geographic location combined with strong 
afﬁliations between medical schools and training hospitals, and how they are essential to 
bringing physicians into llI1d€I‘S6l'V€Cl areas and retaining physicians throughout the State of 
Maine, including rural counties, which may not otherwise have access to such services. 
While current data indicate Maine has a higher-than-average ratio of physicians to population, 
those data do not necessarily reﬂect the reality of access in the state.3 For example, most

physicians in Maine are concentrated in the urban center of Portland, while the rural counties and 
communities remain underserved. Moreover, 40% of Maine’s population lives in three counties 
designated as metropolitan, while the remaining 60% live in Maine’s most rural ll counties, and 
rural areas in Maine have fewer healthcare providers per population. A report issued in April 
2022 by the Maine Rural Health Research Center noted, “Most counties in Maine face shortages 
of primary care, mental health, and/or dental health professionals, with ﬁfteen Maine counties 
designated as partial health professional shortage areas in all three domains: primary care, mental 
health, and dental health.”“ 
This report, unfortunately, reﬂects the reality facing Maine’s small rural hospitals. Some of our 
members have shared with me the increasing need for primary care and specialty care access in 
their communities, as the pandemic pushed many physicians to retire. And, despite great efforts, 
these roles are taking longer and becoming more difficult to ﬁll leaving Mainers to delay 
important medical care or seek care in the emergency department of their community hospital. 
In addition to current physician shortages, Maine’s aging physician Workforce in one of the 
oldest states in the nation means an entire generation of physicians will soon, or have begun to, 
retire en masse and lead to a worsening shortage of physicians, particularly in the rural and 
underserved communities. In September of 2022, the Maine Department of Labor issueda 
healthcare occupations report that noted approximately 30% of Maine’s current healthcare 
workforce, including physicians, were over the age of 55 years old.5 And in June of 2021, the 
Association of American Medical Colleges reported that the U.S is on course to see a physician 
shortage anywhere between 37,800 and 124,000 by 2034, with population aging and an aging 
workforce as primary drivers of future need. For instance, to maintain the status quo, Maine will 
require an additional 120 primary care physicians by 2030, a 9% increase of the state’s current 
l,243 practicing Primary Care Physicians (PCPs). This 9% increase is in addition to the 
backﬁlling of retired physicians over the next 7 years. 6 What these national and local data 
demonstrate is the need for physicians, particularly those educated and trained to provide care in 
rural communities, is only increasing over time. 
It is for these reasons that the MHA supports the exploration of expanding medical school 
education in Maine, with a particular focus on the northern half of the state. 
Thank you and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
