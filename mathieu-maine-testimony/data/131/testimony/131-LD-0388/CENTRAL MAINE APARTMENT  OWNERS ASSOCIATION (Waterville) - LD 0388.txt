Testimony in SUPPORT to LD 388: An Act to Require the State and Municipalities to Reimburse 
Landlords for Unpaid Rent During Eviction Moratoriums 
 
 
To the Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
 
The Central Maine Apartment Owners Association (CMAOA) is a landlord membership organization of over 
650, as well as a cooperative team member of other landlord associations across the State of Maine including: 
Southern Maine, Lewiston Auburn, Greater Bangor Area, and Augusta Area.  We provide educational events, 
sponsor community events, provide access to discounts on supplies and industry needs like fuels, flooring 
materials and paint. Our overall goal is to support Landlords in providing safe and affordable housing in 
collaboration with the valuable good renters in our area.  CMAOA and the other organizations are neutral, 
nonpartisan, member led groups that have the common goal of keeping the rental housing industry safe, 
educated, and competitive.   
We are asking you to Support LD 388 
During the Covid moratorium many landlords were left losing thousands of dollars by no fault of their own.  
Many members reached out to our association and spent additional thousands of dollars in legal fees trying to 
understand what their obligations were in continuing to provide maintenance, utilities, and mortgage payments 
when they were not receiving any income from the occupied units.  As reported by our members, a large 
percentage of the failure to pay rent during this moratorium were persons who participated in voucher programs 
and refused to pay their portion of rent.  Unfortunately, this had a boomerang effect in many members no longer 
participating in voucher programs as failure to pay evictions became and unenforceable mandate.  CMAOA 
contends that a bill such as this would help landlords and tenants alleviate disruptions to their tenancy, property 
services, and income to pay expenses for the owner.   
We urge you to Support LD 388
