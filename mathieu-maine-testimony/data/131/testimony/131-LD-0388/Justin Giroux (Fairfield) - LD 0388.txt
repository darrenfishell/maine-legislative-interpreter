LD 388
I'm in support of LD 388. It makes a lot of sense that the government body issuing an 
eviction moratorium for the non-payment of rent should bear the cost of housing the 
tenant. The bills kept coming in during the pandemic: the mortgage, insurance, 
repairs, and taxes. How is one supposed to pay those without the payment of rent? 
Thank you for introducing this bill.
