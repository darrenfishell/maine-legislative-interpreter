My daughter and her family live with the daily struggles of raising a child with a disability and 
have fought relentlessly to get help in their home. Their 5 year-old daughter was diagnosed 
with Pitt Hopkins syndrome prior to her turning 1 year old. Needless to say, that news was 
very difficult to hear. The daily responsibilities of caring for their daughter takes their 
undivided attention and time. Their daughter is thriving because of their relentless dedication 
to her multiple therapies which is essential to her growth and health. My daughter would love 
to be able to work and contribute to the family household finances but there is no one else to 
care for their daughter. Passing this bill and getting it active is not for fun. It's essential. Not 
only for their family but for the other families that are in the same situation. 
I hope there is serious consideration to making this a reality. Thank you for taking the time to 
review this testimony.
