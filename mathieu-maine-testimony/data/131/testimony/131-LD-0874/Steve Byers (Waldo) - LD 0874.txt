Dear Members of the HHS Committee,     My name is Steve Byers and I live in Waldo, ME. I have worked with several organizations supporting people with disabilities and am here to support several families in my community who are requesting creative solutions that support them and their children.  I am writing in support of LD 874. Imagine yourself a child in a home with multiple self-limiting disabilities and needing 24/7 care. Imagine the qualiﬁed care of a loving parent who understands you most? What would it be like to have new nurses rotating in and out of your life on a monthly or yearly basis; each one require training by your parent. But because your parent cannot go get a nursing degree, they must continue to rely on a system that is reliably unpredictable to make consistent care available. Now imagine yourself being a parent whose job it is to provide 24/7 care and struggles to get consistency of care. Think of the frustration you would feel if you knew that you have the bona ﬁde occupational qualiﬁcation (BFOQ) to fulﬁll the duties of the job that any nurse could but lack the degree to be paid to do so. Imagine all your qualiﬁcations and hours worked overtime yet you will never receive compensation for your high quality care and obvious commitment to one of the most important jobs in your life: caring for your child who requires 24/7 assistance.Please resonate with these families and understand their urgent needs as our health care system experiences growth pains. Please pass LD 874 so that our health care system can become the adaptive and integrative system that it can be.Thank you, Steve Byers135 E Waldo Rd. Waldo, ME
