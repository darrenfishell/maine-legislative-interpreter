LD 874
I am writing to support LD 874. 
I am a nurse and am aware of the shortage of healthcare workers to care for children 
who have disabilities, who have Maine Care and are qualified to have services in the 
home. I am also aware that if no services can be provided for these children, that for 
them to be able to live in their home, the only place where can thrive, all care must be 
provided by the parent(s). This would deny the possibility of allowing a parent to 
work, thus creating a financial hardship on that family.
LD 874 would help to correct this issue and help to relieve the financial burden upon 
such families.
I urge this committee to pass this bill and help to compensate parents who cannot find
services for their disabled child.
Thank you for your time.
