Testimony of Rep. James Dill introducing 
LD 1511, An Act to Update the Laws Governing the University of Maine 
System's Board of Agriculture and to Rename the Maine Agricultural 
Experiment Station 
Before the Agriculture, Conservation and F orestljy Committee 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker and distinguished members of the Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry Committee, my name is Jim Dill, and I represent House District 26 
and the communities of Bradley, Old Town and Penobscot Indian Island. I am here before you 
today to present LD 1511, An Act to Update the Laws Governing the University of Maine 
System's Board of Agriculture and to Rename the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station 
This bill renames the “Maine Agricultural Experiment Station” the “Maine Agricultural and 
Forest Experiment Station” and requires the Director of the station to perform their duties with 
advice from the University of Maine System’s Board of Agriculture. 
It also adds aquaculture and the State’s rural economy to the board’s advisory duties to the 
Chancellor of the University of Maine System and the President of the University of Maine at 
Orono. It also changes the membership of the board and requires the board to invite appropriate 
individuals and conduct a public, facilitated discussion at least once per year to better understand 
the needs and trends in agriculture that would beneﬁt from new or additional research. 
Finally, the bill requires the board to include in its annual report to the Legislature an outline of 
emerging trends in agriculture, to submit annual proposals for additional funding for program 
needs to the Board of Trustees of the University of Maine System and to update its long-range 
plan for operation of the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station every ﬁve years.
