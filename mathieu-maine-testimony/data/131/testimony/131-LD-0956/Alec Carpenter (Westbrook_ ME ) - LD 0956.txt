Good afternoon, 
While the intention of this bill is admirable, a queer person should not be placed in a 
situation where their identity is demanded of. By making it a requirement to share this
data point, you are forcing a person to out themselves or lie. If that person is not out 
yet or not comfortable sharing that information, they may feel that they must lie. 
Healthcare professionals, paraprofessionals, and other industry employees have the 
same biases and prejudices as anyone else and while they many not discriminate 
intentionally, this information could put queer people seeking healthcare in danger. 
As a practical example, I worked in medical records briefly and while I was 
transferring a fellow lesbian's records from one system to the other, I noticed that her 
doctor was ridiculing her in their notes for being depressed after the Pulse nightclub 
shooting. The doctor felt she was being dramatic and refused to refer to a professional
who could help her. I would like to note here that most queer people would not find 
this dramatic and would likely admit to feeling similarly. It was a deeply traumatizing
experience for so many of us. Because of this, I do not personally share my sexuality 
with my healthcare provider unless it's relevant to my treatment. It almost never is 
and I feel safer by staying silent. 
Again, this is an admirable step but there are places in Maine where it is not safe to be
open about your gender identity or sexuality and by making these parts of personhood
required to seek medical care is placing queer people potentially in more danger. I 
know I said that twice, but it needed to be repeated. 
As mentioned, lying is certainly an option but there isn't really a way to describe the 
feeling of stepping back into the closet after being out of it. To be blunt: it sucks. 
Sometimes we go so far left we end up going right. 
Thank you, 
Alec
