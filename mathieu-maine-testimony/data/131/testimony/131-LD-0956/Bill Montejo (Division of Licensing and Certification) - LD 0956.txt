Re: LD 956 An Act Concerning Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data Collection in 
Health Care Facilities   
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Committee on Health and 
Human Services:  
 
The Department of Health and Human Service s is glad to  offer this letter in support of LD 956, An 
Act Concerning Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data Collection in Health Care Facilities.  
 
This bill requires health care facilities to collect data related to sexual orienta tion and gender 
identity from an individual as part of the individual's health care information.  This was 
recommend ed by an Institute of Medicine report in 2011  but is still not uniformly done.  We 
understand that t he federal uniform data system has included sexual orientation and gender identity 
data since 2016  and that this data will be  part of an individual's health care information that is 
confidential under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 1711 -C.  
 
According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control , many health care providers do not routinely 
discuss sexual orientation or gender identity ( “SO/GI ”) with patients - and collecting SO/GI data 
in electronic health records is essential to providing high -quality, patient -centered care. Witho ut 
better information patients and their specific health care needs are not identified, and health 
disparities can be exacerbated.1 
 
To address the lack of SO/GI data in health systems, the US Department of Health and Human 
Services’ Healthy People 20 30 included four objective s related to increase d data collection on 
sexual orientation and gender identity .2 Increasing the number of population -based data systems 
that collect standardized data statistics has also been a priority for other federal agencies.3   
 
For these reasons, DHHS recommend s the Committee accept this bill as Ought to Pass.
