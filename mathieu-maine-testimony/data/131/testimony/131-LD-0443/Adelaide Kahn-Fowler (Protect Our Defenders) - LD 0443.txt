Written Testimony in Support of LD443: An Act to Prohibit Marriage of Any Person 
Under 18 Years of Age  
Presented to the Maine Committee on Judiciary | March 2, 2023  
 
Chair Carney, Chair Moonen , and distinguished committee members:  
Protect Our Defenders is the pre -eminent national human rights organization dedicated to ending 
sexual violence, victim retaliation, misogyny, sexual prejudice, and racism in the military and 
combating a culture that has allowed it to persist. We honor, support, and give voice to survivors 
of military sexual violence. We seek reform to ensure all service members are provided a safe 
and respectful work environment free from misogyny and racism, and have access to a fair, 
impartially administered sys tem of justice.  
In order to fulfill our mission, we provide pro bono legal services to survivors of military sexual 
assault, advocate for military sexual assault reform, and publish and proliferate ground -breaking 
reports that expose the crises of sexual a ssault and racial discrimination in the military. Since our 
founding in 2011, we have assisted a number of child victims of military sexual assault and their 
families, who are left devastated following incidents that no child should ever have to endure. In  
FY 2020 alone, the DoD’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) reported 
that there were 209 unique victims of child sexual abuse, 92.3% of which were female, and 7.7% 
were male.1 
When it came to our attention that some lawmakers have resisted ending child marriage so that 
an active duty servicemember might be able to marry a child for the child to be able to benefit 
from spousal death benefits, we were left deeply shaken. The military has a crisis on its hands in 
the form of sexual ass ault, which has been acknowledged by the Secretary of Defense2, military

 leaders such as General Mark Milley3, and the Commander in Chief, President Joe Biden4. 
Allowing for the perpetuation of chil d marriage under the guise that children stand to benefit is a 
fallacy. Under the Survivor Benefit Plan, servicemembers have the ability to designate a 
recipient for their death benefits, and that recipient is NOT limited only to spouses, thus enabling 
a servicemember to designate their benefits to whomever he or she desires.  
We fear that continuing to proliferate the narrative that a servicemember should be allowed to 
marry children to ensure that child receives spousal benefits will enable those who wish to prey 
on children to do so under the guise of a legal union. This is very dangerous in any profession 
and in any setting, but especially within the U.S. military, which is already contending with a 
sexual assault crisis it cannot control.  
Thank you for y our time and consideration.  
Very Respectfully,  
 
Adelaide Kahn -Fowler  
Director of Programs & Policy,  Protect Our Defenders
