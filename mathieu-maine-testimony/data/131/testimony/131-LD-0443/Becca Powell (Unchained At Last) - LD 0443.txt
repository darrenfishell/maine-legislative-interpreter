 
 
Testimony  in Support  of LD443: An Act to Prohibit Marriage of Any Person Under 18 Years of Age  
Presented to the Maine Committee on Judiciary | March 2, 202 3 
 
Chair  Carney , Chair Moonen  and distinguished committee members:  Unchained At Last is a survivor -led nonprofit working to 
end forced and child marriage in Maine and across the United States through direct services and advocacy. We at Unchained 
urge you to vote “YES” on LD443  and eliminate the archaic, harmful practice o f child marriage.  
 
The marriage age is 18, but the law includes an alarming  loophole: 16- and 17 -year-olds may marry with parental “consent .”1 
This loophole remains in place even after Maine passed legislation in 2019 -2020 to eliminate marriage at age 15 or younger  
(previously, children of any age could marry).  
 
The remaining loophole still seriously endanger s Maine  children:  
• When a minor  is forced to marry, the perpetrators are typically  the parents , so p arental “consent” is often  “coercion .” Even 
when a teen shows up sobbing at the clerk’s office  and begs for help , the law provides no recourse . 
• Minors are automatically emancipated upon m arriage ,2 likely ending their parents’ financial obligation to them, regardless of 
the minors’ level of financial independence. This can lead to teen homelessness, especially since 70 -80% of marriages 
before age 18 end in divorce.3 
• 100% of the children who married in Maine between 2017 and 2019 were age 16  or 17.4 Thus the 2019 -2020  law failed to 
protect 100% of the children it was supposed to protect.  
 
Further, marriage  before 18  is recognized as a “ human rights abuse ”5 that produces lifelong repercussions : 
• Children  – even highly mature 17 -year-olds – can easily be forced into marriage or forced to stay in a marriage before they 
turn 18 and attain the rights of adulthood .6 They  face overwhelming legal and practical barriers if they try to leave home,7 
enter a shelter,8 retain an attorney9 or independently  bring a legal action.10  
o Automatic emancipation upon  marriage does not solve  this problem. It brings only limited rights of adulthood and only 
after the minor has endured the trauma of a forced marriage.  
• Marriage at 16 or 17  destroys  girls’ health, education and economic prospects  and increases  their risk of experiencing 
violence.11  
• Teen mothers who marry and then divorce are much more likely to end up in poverty than teen mothers who stay single  – 
and, again, t hose who marry  before 18 have a 70 -80% chance of getting divorce d.12 
 
This human rights abuse is happening too often :  
• 42 children were married in Maine  between 2017 and 20 21, and 33 of them – 79% – were girls wed to adult men.13 
• Another estimated 787 children were married in Maine between 2000 and 201 6 (for which years the state could not provide 
marriage -certificate data ).14 In total, some  829 children were married in Maine between 2000 and 20 21. 
 
Maine  can solve this problem by passing LD443  and eliminating the dangerous loophole that allows minors to be entered into 
marriage. States and territories across the U.S. are moving to pass legislation to this effect, since it costs nothing, harms  no one 
and e nds a human rights abuse. Please vote “YES” on LD443  and finally end the archaic, harmful practice of child 
marriage.

direction of his parents, works complete emancipation.” Also see https://www. courts.maine.gov/courts/family/emancipation.html: “By getting married with your parents’ permission, you 
become emancipated.”
