We represent Notaries in Maine and Justices of the Peace (JPs) from other New England states. On behalf of our Maine members, JPus is strongly in favor of LD 443, An Act to Prohibit Marriage of Any Person Under 18 Years of Age. Therefore, I urge you to vote YES for the bill.   Legal Rights When minors marry, they do not have access to the same legal rights as adults. For instance, when a 16- or 17-year-old gets married, they are three times more likely to be beaten by their spouse compared to 21-year-olds.i But the state’s child welfare agency cannot protect them since they are not under the care of their parents. Nor can they enter a domestic violence shelter since they are not yet 18. Kids who marry face overwhelming legal and practical barriers if they try to leave home, retain an attorney or bring a legal action. This lack of protection leaves the youth very vulnerable.  Lifelong Consequences Girls (it is usually girls) who marry are less likely to finish high school or graduate from college. Furthermore, they are 31% more likely to live in poverty.ii Unsurprisingly, this carries over into adulthood. To illustrate, kids who marry are 11% more likely to be poor when olderiii. Child marriage devastates girls' lives. It destroys their health, education and economic opportunities, and increases their risk of experiencing violence. In fact, marriage before 18 is recognized as a human rights abuse by the U.S. State Department because it produces devastating, lifelong consequences.iv   Parents are Perpetrators Sixteen and 17-year-old children can easily be forced to marry. Parental "consent" does not mitigate that danger - When a child is forced to marry, the perpetrators are almost always the parents. As a result, exceptions to the law that involve parents or courts do not mitigate the risk.   Notary Publics JPus members are professionals who take an oath to execute the laws of the state, and to abide by our Code of Ethics. Current Maine law allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to wed puts these two at

Our members have voiced strong opposition to all child marriages. They have said that they would not feel comfortable performing them and would likely refuse to do so. To that point, in October 2018, JPus polled members. Ninety-five percent votedv to join the national Coalition to End Child Marriage which has a no-exceptions platform to make 18 the minimum age to wed.   LD443 will protect all children in the state of Maine from the dangers of child marriage. Passage of this bill will also alleviate the state’s notaries from conflicting legal and ethical obligations. As such, on behalf of Maine’s notaries, we respectfully ask you to vote YES in support of the bill.   Thank you for this opportunity to share our position. I am available for any questions or to discuss this matter further.
