Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs:
My
name
is
Olivia
Griset.
I
am
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Maine
Environmental
Education
Association
(MEEA).
I
am
here
today
on
behalf
of
MEEA
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
612.
MEEA
is
a
nonprofit
statewide
professional
network
representing
over
1,500
Maine
educators,
both
classroom
teachers
and
community
based
educators
at
libraries,
museums,
and
science
and
nature
centers.
For
forty
years
we
have
supported
Maine
educators
in
providing
high
quality ,
locally
relevant,
hands-on
experience
for
Maine
youth.
I
am
testifying
today
in
support
of
LD
612
because
it
will
save
Maine
school
districts
money
by
helping
them
reduce
their
energy-related
spending
as
well
as
their
carbon
footprint.
As
community
facilities,
Maine’ s
school
buildings
use
significant
amounts
of
energy
for
heating,
cooling,
lighting,
and
other
essential
facilities.
W e
all
know
how
much
the
cost
of
energy
has
increased
lately ,
and
when
it
comes
to
school
districts
the
cost
ultimately
falls
on
Maine
taxpayers.
Maine’ s
also
pursuing
policies
to
decarbonize
our
society ,
and
investing
in
our
school
buildings
and
transportation
of fers
unique
opportunities
to
combine
education
and
energy-related
community
savings
and
create
jobs.
This
bill
will
give
schools
the
support
they
need,
by
creating
a
state-level
Green
Schools
Coordinator ,
to
assist
department
staf f
and
community
members
in
establishing
school
facility
priorities
and
working
with
school
districts
regarding
building
weatherization
and
modification
for
the
use
of
renewable
energy
resources.
The
coordinator
would
help
school
districts
navigate
valuable
opportunities
including
federal
grants
under
the
Inflation
Reduction
Act
and
other
laws,
revolving
loan
funds,
and
technical
assistance.
Without
a
coordinator
at
the
state
level,
each
school
distinct
will
have
to
find
its
own
way .
The
coordinator
position
established
in
LD
612
would
ef ficiently
serve
as
a
navigator
for
our
school
districts.
Thank
you
so
much
for
considering
this
bill.
I
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
and
support
the
Committee
in
the
upcoming
work
session.
