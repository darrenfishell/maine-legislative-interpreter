Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members ofthe-'Joint __Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and!»-l‘echnology, my name is Dana Doran, and I am theExecutive Director of the Professional 
Logging Contractors of Maine.The Professional Logging-_Contracto' rs of Maine (PLC) is a trade~ 
association located in Augusta that represents logging and associated trucking contractors throughout 
the state of Maine. The PLC was formed inV 
1995 to give independent contractors a voice in a -rapidly -
Q 
changing forest industry.< 
. .. 
_. 
As of 2021, logging and trucking contractors -in Maine employed over 3,000 people directly and were 
indirectly responsible for the creation of an additional 2,500 jobs. This employment and theinvestments 
that contractors make contributed $582 million to the state’s,econo1r_ 1y. Our membership, ‘which includes 
200 contractor members and an additional 120 associate members, employs more than 75% of the‘ 
individuals who work in this industry and is also responsible for 80% of Maine’ s annual timber harvest. 
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify‘ 
on behalf of our membership in conditional ‘. 
support of Ll),16o6 — An Act to Finance Clean Energy and Infrastructure in Maine. 1In _ 2021, we 
supported Representative Zeigler’s bill, LD 1659 .+ An Act to Create the Maine Clean Energy and 
Sustainability Accelerator,-which was the authorizing legislation that this bill seeks to amend. Our 
testimony today endorses Section 1 of the bill, but requests that Section 2 be amended to include alli 
forms of renewable energy which are already recognized in 35-A MRSA §1o12* 9, Subsection 1.I.‘ 
The Maine Clean" Energy and Sustainability Accelerator program was created in the 130*“ Legislature to‘ 
complement the Establishment of Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy Programs. The Maine. 
Clean Energy and Sustain _ability' Accelerator Program is an renewable energy agnostic and did not pick 
winners and losers, We believe that if this legislation will amend the program, it should-be consistent 
with current law and also not pick winners and losers. _ _. 
We would also like to bring to this committee ’s-attention that in 2019, Governor Mills signed into law, LD 
375, An Act to Promote the Forest Products Industryin School Construction and Renovation- Involving 
Heating Systems. Public Law, Chapter 53 — 2019, which I have attached" to my testimony, states _. 
speciﬁcally that in approving school constructionf 
or renovation projects, school boards must consider 
‘heating systems that use renewable, locally sourced wood-based fuels. If the bill before-you today wereto 
move forwardas written,'it would be counter to current law. Toensure this doesn’t occur, we would 
request that Section 2 be amended to allow for all renewable energy sources already prescribed in 35-A 
MRSA §1o129' ,'Subsection 1.1.»
