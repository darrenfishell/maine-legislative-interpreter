Good afternoon Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and honorable 
members of the State and Local Government Committee, 
I am Tate Graham and I am Oscar Stanton and we are from Old Orchard 
Beach. 
We are here in support of having a State Butterfly. Butterflies help to 
pollinate our gardens, they are very pretty, and a bunch of other states 
have state butterﬂies, so we thought we should too. 
We originally thought the State butterﬂy should be the Hessel’s Hairstreak, 
which can be found in York County, but we met with an insect expert from 
the-Department of lnland Fisheries and Wildlife and they helped us think 
about other possible butterflies that live all over Maine. With further 
research our class voted and we agreed on the Pink Edged Sulfur. 
The pink edged sulfur is found all over the state of Maine. It is native to our 
state, and it is an important pollinator in the ecosystem, plus its caterpillar 
eats our Maine State fruit, the blueberry. lt might not be the largest or most 
popular butterfly but it has the most connections to Maine. That's why we 
think the Pink Edged Sulfur should be the Maine State Butterfly.
