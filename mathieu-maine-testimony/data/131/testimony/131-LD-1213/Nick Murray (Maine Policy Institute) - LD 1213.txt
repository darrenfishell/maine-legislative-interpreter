Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1213,
“An
Act
to
Reform
Income
Taxes
by
Reducing
Tax
Rates
for
Each
of
the
3
Income
Tax
Brackets”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1213.
We
commend
the
sponsors
for
bringing
forward
this
piece
of
bipartisan
tax
reform
legislation,
which
would
provide
current
and
prospective
Mainers
a
greater
ability
to
plan
and
achieve
their
goals
by
telling
folks
that
the
state
will
be
taking
less
of
their
hard-earned
income.
This
bill
would
bring
basic,
commonsense
tax
reform
that
Mainers
not
only
deserve
today,
but
sorely
need.
It
would
lower
income
taxes
for
all
single
filers
earning
less
than
$80,000
per
year,
or
joint
filers
earning
$160,000/year,
but
it
would
provide
a
substantially
larger
benefit
for
those
on
the
lower
side
of
the
earnings
distribution
by
lowering
taxable
income
up
to
$23,000/year
for
a
single
filer
by
half.
Even
though
this
reform
proposal
might
seem
to
some
on
this
committee
as
too
far,
keep
this
in
mind:
Maine
imposes
the
highest
tax
rate
on
income
made
up
to
$100,000
for
a
single
filer
than
any
other
state
in
New
England.
If
this
bill
were
to
pass,
it
would
simply
bring
Maine’s
tax
code
at
most
incomes,
especially
those
at
the
lower
end
of
the
earning
spectrum,
into
relative
parity
with
other
states
in
our
region.

Income
taxes
are
truly
unlike
any
other
tax.
It
places
a
disincentive
to
work
and
create
value
for
others.
Legislators
should
not
be
surprised
that
our
state’s
workforce
participation
and
average
household
income
are
paltry
compared
to
the
nation,
due
to
the
oppressive
income
tax
structure
we
have
in
place.
Ideally,
the
state
would
promote
earnings
instead
of
taxing
them.
Until
then,
bills
like
LD
1213
are
no-brainers
if
we
want
to
raise
the
standard
of
living
for
Maine
people.
Tax
policy
is
a
significant
part
of
the
decision-making
process
for
businesses
and
families
choosing
where
to
reside.
Please
deem
LD
1213
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
work
to
build
a
tax
policy
environment
that
promotes
growth
instead
of
stagnation.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
