Testimony in Opposition to LD 1213, An Act to Reform Income Taxes by Reducing Tax 
Rates for Each of the 3 Income Tax Brackets 
April 11, 2023 
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee, my name is 
Maura Pillsbury and I am an analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy. I am here today 
to testify in opposition to LD 1213. LD 1213 would change Maine’s income tax structure by 
lowering income tax rates, changing the cut offs on Maine’s tax brackets, and creating a new 
middle bracket. Sen. Baldacci’s proposed amendment to LD 1213 would combine the existing 
graduated tax structure with a new bottom bracket of 3 percent for households making up to 
$45,000(single)/$90,000(married filing jointly). Households over $45,000/$90,000 would pay the 
graduated rates on the entirety of their income. The following tables show Maine’s current tax 
structure compared to these two proposals. 
 
Maine’s current income tax structure, Tax year 2023 
 
Tax Taxable income, single filer Taxable income, married joint filer 
5.8% $0 - $24,500 $0 - $49,050 
6.75% $24,500 - $58,050 $49,050 - $116,100 
7.15% $58,050 and higher $116,100 and higher 
 
LD 1213 proposed income tax structure

5% $23,000 - $54,450 $46,000 - $108,900 
7% $54,450 - $80,000 $108,900 - $160,000 
7.15% $80,000 and higher $160,000 and higher

7.15% $58,050 and higher $116,100 and higher 
*Only for those with total income above $45,000 single/$90,000 married filing jointly 
 
MECEP opposes proposals to cut income taxes on Mainers with wealth. As we have detailed in 
past testimony: 1) income taxes allow the state to provide important programs and services that 
Mainers depend on, and 2) income tax is the fairest way to raise revenue because people with 
greater ability to pay are responsible for paying more, balancing out the sales and property tax 
which asks more of people with the least ability to pay.  
 
Tax cuts on the bottom brackets largely would not benefit people most in need and actually 
would provide a greater benefit to higher earners. Families with lower income would get a 
smaller benefit because Maine’s standard deduction and targeted tax credits make it less likely 
 
   
 for them to have enough taxable income that reaches the upper boundary of the lowest bracket. 
The proposed amendment seeks to rectify this by keeping the existing tax structure in place for 
anyone earning over $45,000/$90,000 and targeting the tax cut only toward those earning under 
this amount. However, this is still concerning for the reasons mentioned above, and because it 
would create a tax ‘cliff’ between those who earn $45,000/$90,000 and under who would pay 3 
percent in income taxes, and those who earn just over $45,000/$90,000 who would pay 5.8 
percent in income taxes on their income up to $45,000/$90,000.  
 
There are better and more equitable ways to support Mainers with low- and middle-income, like 
expanding the child tax credit and the property tax fairness credit, which we would urge you to 
do instead. 
 
Maine has huge unmet needs, including a housing crisis, opioid epidemic, rising energy costs, a 
deteriorating direct care workforce, and a lack of child care. Solving these issues requires 
funding. Cutting taxes could endanger Maine’s ability to address these issues and to continue 
funding our existing obligations, including 55% of education, revenue sharing, and MaineCare 
expansion. It also puts our future prosperity at risk if we enter a recession and are unable to 
raise revenue to meet Maine’s basic commitments to its people. 
 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions.
