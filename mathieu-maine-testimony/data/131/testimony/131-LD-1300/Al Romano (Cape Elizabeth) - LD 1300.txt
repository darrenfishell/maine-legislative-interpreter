I think the current process of giving citizens of a school district the opportunity to 
weigh in on one of the most important activities impacting their day to day lives - the 
cost of education.  
If understand the proposed change to the current process, to add another opportunity 
for citizens, through their elected municipality representatives, to be heard with 
respect to a school budget, this bill should be passed.
