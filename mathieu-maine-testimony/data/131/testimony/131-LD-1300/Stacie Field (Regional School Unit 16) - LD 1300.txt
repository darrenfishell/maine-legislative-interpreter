Testimony for LD 1300 
 
Any member of a Municipality can provide input into a school budget. There are informational 
meetings, as well as the required District Budget Meeting.  
This LD is specific for RSU and SAD, as municipal school units are already overseen by the 
municipality. Therefore, this just makes it even more difficult to pass a school budget, and adds 
another layer to an already laborious process.  While school budgets must pass both a District 
Budget Meeting and a Budget Validation Referendum, cities, towns, and the State do not.   
In RSU 16, we have three towns and 15 board members, five from each town; Therefore, the 
members have a weighted vote. Will that be the same for the municipal officers who will be 
required to vote on the budget before it can go before voters? Municipal officers tend to favor 
their own towns.  With their weighed vote, Poland would be able to vote down items needed 
for the Minot school, if items were also needed for Poland, but the budget needed to be 
reduced.  
Will each town have a required date by which they must hold their meetings in order for the 
District to meet its posting and voting requirements? Please consider all the moving parts of a 
school budget that were put in place when the RSU law was enacted, before adding more 
requirements and a longer time line, before schools can have a working budget.
