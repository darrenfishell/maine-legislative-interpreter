Good morning Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members ofthe 
Committee on Health and Human Services My name IS Angela Westhoff, and I serve as the 
President & CEO of the Maine] 
Health Care Association We represent approximately 200 
nursing homes, assisted living, and residential care facilities (also known as Private Non-Medical 
Institutions or PNM|s) across the state Our mission IS to empower members to ensure the 
integrity, quality, and sustainability of long term care in Maine
( 
I am here today to present testimony in support of LD 1827, An Act to Prevent Closures and 
Ensure Sustainability of Nursing Facilities, Private Nonmedical Institutions and Residential Care 
Facilities by Removing So-called Budget Neutrality This bill seeks to eliminate the so-called 
budget neutrality provisions related to transferring and selling beds between nursing facilities 
and residential care facilities, converting beds from nursing to residential care, and delicensing 
nursing facility beds 
The long term care industry IS in a fragile state On numerous occasions, I have testified before 
this committee on the severe workforce crisis facing the sector In addition to workforce 
challenges, current reimbursement rates do not cover all allowable costs of providing long term 
care Specifically, there is a $40 per day difference between the allowable costs per resident
day and the average MaineCare reimbursement rate for nursing homes And while we are very 
grateful to the legislature for appropriating one-time supplemental funding, our sector still 
faces a $47 million annual shortfall (per BerryDunn ’s analysis of 2021 cost report data) There 
have been 15 facility closures in the last three years, and additional closures were just 
announced last month 
Approximately 30 years ago, in order to maintain so-called ”budget neutrality," the state put 
into policy a requirement that any new costs to the system have to be wholly offset by 
reductions in MaineCare costs elsewhere If replacement facilities are to be built, an operator 
must shut down beds in another part ofthe state and relocate residents in order to meet 
budget neutrality That is one of the consequences of this policy This occurred during a time 
when the Department was seeking to decrease nursing home beds and create more residential 
care facility beds/Private Non-Medical Institution (PNMI) Appendix C beds 
The policy did rts ]Ob However, we need to ask the question Does this public policy from three 
decades ago work now, given that our demographics have shifted significantly since 1994 and 
nursing homes are closing at an alarming pace? Reducing beds, even if occupied, at a time 
when we have backlogs of residents in hospital emergency rooms needing placement in long 
term care is a real challenge, and one policy makers should examine 
Budget neutrality isn't the only reason that nursing homes have closed, but it's one of the 
reasons There are others here to testify today who have much more detailed knowledge to 
share on the impact of budget neutrality, in particular as it pertains to the sale of long term 
care facilities We know rate reform IS on the horizon and that many aspects of long term care 
funding will be examined including this provision But more importantly, we call upon the 
legislature to adequately invest in long term care now in order to protect access to these critical 
services for the people of Maine for the future Thank you for the opportunity to provide 
comments today, and I would be happy to try and answer any questions
