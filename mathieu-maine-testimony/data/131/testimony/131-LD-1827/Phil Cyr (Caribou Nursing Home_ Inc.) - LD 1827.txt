To the Joint Standmg Committee on Health & Human Services

In Favor of LD 1827, An Act to Prevent Closures and Ensure Sustainability of Nursing Facilities, 
Private Nonmedical Institutions and Residential Care Facilities by 
Removing So-called Budget Neutrality 
Good mommg, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Committee 
on Health and Human Services My name is Phil Cyr and I am the President of Caribou Nursing Home, 
Inc , which this week celebrates the 50*“ aimiversary of our ﬁrst Admission, done on May 8, 1973 
Imagine if the Department of Education required one town to close its school forever so that another 
town could have a new one Would the people of Maine support that type of policy‘? That 1S what the 
Maine DHHS Budget Neutrality policy does for Maine’s Long Term Care (LTC) facilities, namely 
Nursing Facilities (NF), Private Non-Medical Institutions (PNMI) and Residential Care Facilities (RCF) 
When this policy began in approximately 1994, its reason was to provide an incentive for moving 
forward with the PNMI program PNMI cost to the state is less than similar care in a Nursing facility 
At the same time, state policy changed medical qualiﬁcations for nursing facility care to twice as 
hard as before the changed standards For the number of elderly needmg LTC at that time, and with 
PNMI beds replacing NF beds, supply and demand remamed mostly in balance Looking back, the 
neutrality policy did its work NF beds were closed to fund PNMI beds

“Our Service Says We Care"
However today, we see umntended consequences 
Budget Neutral1ty requlres the cost to Ma1neCare not mcrease due to the replacement, ma] or renovat1on 
or sale of exlstmg fac1l1t1es In 2023, 1f a replacement fac1l1ty 1s to be bu1lt, 1ts cost W111 be 
approxlmately double what 1t cost to bulld the aged fac1l1ty 1t 1s replac1ng Therefore 1t w1ll llkely have 
only half as many beds as 1ts older predecessor Elther that or an operatmg fac1l1ty 1n another area of the 
state w1ll shut down, and relocate 1ts resrdents 1n order to meet budget neutrallty to fund the new fac1l1ty 
Budget neutrahty 1s also requlred when a ret1r1ng owner looks to change ownerslnp In that s1tuat1on, 
the pol1cy reduces the number of beds even 1f they are full Budget neutrahty 1sn’t the only reason that 
nurslng homes have closed but 1t’s one of the reasons, and th1s pol1cy 1s 30 years from 1ts or1g1nal 
foundmg Unmtended consequences are never the d6S1I‘Cd outcome of publ1c health pol1cy By leav1ng a 
legacy rule 1n place that leaves a lack of access to sktlled nursmg care, at a tlme when hospltals are 
ﬁll1ng up w1th LTC patlents, 1s a pol1cy that 1s bad for Ma1neCare beneﬁclarles, bad for hosp1tals, 
and bad for commun1t1es who lose beds, _]Ol3S, and property taxes when thelr local LTC fac1l1ty closes 
I urge you to pass LD 1827 Thank you for the work you do to enhance the ava1lab1l1ty of LTC servlces 
for Ma1ne’s elderly
