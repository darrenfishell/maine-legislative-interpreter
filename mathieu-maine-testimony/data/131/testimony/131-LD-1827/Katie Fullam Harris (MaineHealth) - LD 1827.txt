“An Act to Prevent Closures and Ensure Sustalnabllity of Nurslng Facllitles, 
Private Nonmed1cal Inst1tut1ons and Res1dent1a1 Care Facilit1es by Removlng 
S0-called Budget Neutrahty ” 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Baldaccl, Representanve Meyer and dtstlngulshed members of the joint Standing Comrmttee 
on Health and Human Serv1ces, I am Kane Fullarn Harns, and I am here to test1fy 1n strong support 
of LD 1827, “An Act to Prevent Closures and Ensure Sustalnablhty of Nursmg F ac1l111es, Pr1vate 
Nonrnedlcal Insntunons and Res1dent1al Care Fac1l111es by Removmg So-called Budget Neutrallty” 
Ma1ne’s long-term care system 1s 111 cns1s Yesterday, Ma1neHealth hosp1tals housed 76 pattents who 
had been medlcally cleared for dlscharge to long-term care, but for whom there 1s no long-term care 
bed avmlable Of those, 57 needed nurslng-level care As we have WOIk6(l’ to ldentlfy solutlons for 
our panents, the convoluted regulatory construct that governs the ownershlp of long-term care beds 
has been 1dent1ﬁed as a s1g-nlﬁcant barner to a funct1onallong-term care system to meet the needs of 
Ma1ne’s populanon 
The so-called “budget neutrahty ” prov1s1on w1thm Mame statute reqmres that any prov1der that 
wants to bu1ld or operate addltronal long-term care beds must “pay to play ” F1rst, state approval of 
any new beds or the transfer of eX1st1ng beds 1s contingent upon provmg that the MameCare costs 
w1ll remam neutral As operattng costs Jncrease, and MameCare rates necessanly mcrease, the mam 
Way to achleve “budget neutrallty ” 1s to reduce the nuxnber of beds avmlable Such dec1s1ons are not 
based on demographics or demonstrated needs of Ma1ne’s commumtles, but rather solely, on 
whetl1er the operanon of beds w1ll rncrease MameCare costs It 1s the cart leadmg the horse 
In add1t10n, Ma111eCare ’s calculanon for budget neutrahty assumes that every nursmg fac1l1ty bed 1sa 
MameCare bed — or that 100°/o of the beds Wlll be ﬁlled w1th MameCare patients Tl1lS 1s rarely the 
case, and 1t results m an art1ﬁc1al reductron m bed supply 
At the same 1IlII1€, th1s scenano has created a pnvate market 1n wh1ch entrants must purchase from 
one another the opportumty to b1ll MameCare Tlns 1s called “bed rights ” So, those ent111es that 
want to expand the number of beds they operate or enter the market must ﬁnd another prov1der 
that has unused “bed rlghts” and negonate a pr1ce In other words, not‘ only must they pay for the 
mfrastructure and labor to PIOV1Cl€ care for th1s vulnerable populanon, but they also must purchase 
the nght to b1ll MameCare for a S6IV1C€ that falls to cover the cost of care for res1dents 
Th1s leads to a seenarlo 1n wlnch provlders who “own” bed nghts ma1nta1n ownershlp but do not 
necessanly use those bed nghts by tak1ng MameCare panents and b]llJI1g for them They can 
ma1nta1n ownersh1p of bed nghts as eqmty w1thout operating MameCare beds

It 1s not a wonder we are m a long-term care cr1s1s 
We support thls bill, and partrcularly m the context of LD 1785 The entlre long-term care legal and 
regulatory framework must be revrewed carefully by stakeholders to recommend needed changes to 
better meet the needs of Mame’s populatlon 
Thank you for the opportumty to speak
