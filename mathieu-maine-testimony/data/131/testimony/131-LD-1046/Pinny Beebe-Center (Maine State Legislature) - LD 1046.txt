Testimony of Senator Pimiy Beebe-Center introducing 
LD 1046, “An Act to Decriminalize Public Drinking ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
March 27, 2023 
Good morning, Representative Salisbury and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety. I am Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, and I represent all of Knox County, 
except for Isle Au Haut and the town of Washington. I am here today to present LD 1046, “An Act to 
Decrirninalize Public Drinking. ” 
Currently in Maine’s law, public drinking is a Class E crime. This means that this offense will be ona 
criminal record and appear on background checks. Currently, I don’t believe the punishment really ﬁts the 
crime, as public drinking is a minor offense and should be treated more accordingly. The law currently 
disproportionately targets unhoused individuals in our state, creating another barrier to overcoming their 
condition. 
This legislation would simply make public drinking a civil violation, making the punishment more 
appropriate for the crime. The ﬁne that this crime would carry would be no more than $100. If smoking 
marijuana in public is classiﬁed as a civil offensehere in Maine, then I don’t see why it should be any 
different for public drinking. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I invite you to direct questions to Jeremy Pratt, President- 
Elect from the Maine Association of Crimina1'Defense Lawyers. Thank you.
