RE: LD 1046 An Act to Decriminalize Public Drinking
Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and M embers of theCriminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:
MACDLsupportsLD 1046.
Public drinking is a criminal oﬀense that disproportionately aﬀects the hom eless,the poorest of our society. The obstacles to overcoming hom elessness and po vertyrequires a herculean eﬀort and that eﬀort is made even greater by ha ving criminalconvictions.
Public drinking is a minor oﬀense that is more on the scale of a driving oﬀe nseand should be treated accordingly. If this bill is passed publ ic drinking wi ll still beprohibited but it will be a civil, violation not a criminal oﬀense. Lastly, it is worthnoting that smoking marijuana in public is a civil oﬀense (Title 28-B §1501( c)).There is no reasonable argument why public drinking should not  be treated in thesame manner as smoking marijuana in public.
Thank you for considering this bill.
Sincerely,
/s/
Jeremy PrattPresident-Elect, MACDL
