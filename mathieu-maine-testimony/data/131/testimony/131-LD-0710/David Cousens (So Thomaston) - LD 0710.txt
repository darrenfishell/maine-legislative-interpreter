Good afternoon Marine Resources Committee, my name is David Cousens I am a 
lobsterman from Criehaven island. I have been lobstering full time since 1980. I also 
was President of the Maine lobsterman’s Association from 1991 until 2018. I am in 
favor of the state putting some money into the defense fund from the general fund. I 
am absolutely opposed to taking any money from the promotion consul as this money 
has been dedicated for the use to promote the lobster industry in this age of 
disinformation. This money is paid in to the promotion consul for the express purpose
to promote the lobster industry and is being used now to have answers to all the 
negative publicity that the lobster industry has been receiving from the whale 
community. It seems to me you went in with a bill to help fund the defense of the 
lobster industry with general fund money, and ended up tying to rob the fund of the 
promotion consul fund. I believe that most of the lobster industry that understands 
how much we need the promotion consul to be able to defend ourselves against the 
rederic of the environmental groups, would be adamantly opposed to you raiding the 
money to run this consul. I would suggest that you go with the idea of taking money 
from the general fund and if you don’t feel like that is a good idea then vote the bill 
down. Thanks for your time.David Cousens
