Ld 710
I normally don’t support tax dollars be spent for 
a private business legal expense but This is 
more than just the lobster industry.
The attorney general should be suing NOAA on 
behalf of the state of Maine just as the attorney 
general of Virginia did and won his case. He 
should sue NOAA as a complainant. If he did we 
probably wouldn’t need this bill.
Losing the Lobster industry is more that just 
going to affect just one industry it will also 
affect the Boat building industry and also the 
restaurant industry many people will lose their 
jobs Believe it or not many people don’t know 
where Maine is but they do know Maine 
lobster is the best
For these reasons I ask you to support LD710 
and help the state of maine
Thank you
