Re: In Opposition to  LD 710 An Act to Fund the Lobster Legal Defense Fund  
 
Senator  Reny , Representat ive Hepler , and m ember s of the Committee on Marine 
Resources : 
 
My name is Beth Gallie and  I am President of Main e Animal Coalition.  Maine Animal 
Coalition is a not for profit dedicated to the elimination of animal abuse and e xploitation 
through education , adv ocacy, and example.  
Maine Animal Coalition opposes fund ing the Lobster Legal Defense Fund because we 
support the  executive and judicial branches of the  federal government  and 
environmental  groups in their  efforts to p reserve the Right Whale from extinction.  
We have been informed by scientists that there are indeed Right Whales in the waters 
where  Maine lobstermen place their traps. We believe it is imperative  that the lobster 
industry not delay mo dernizing its equipment and adapting its working patterns to sa ve 
the Right Whales . The money of the taxpay ers of Maine would be better spent on 
prevention and not litigation.  
 
Sincerely,  
Beth Gallie
