Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, Honorable Members of the Marine Resource Committee:
My name is Virginia Olsen, I am a commercial lobsterman from Stonington and the Director of the 
Maine Lobstering Union.  
The MLU is testifying in favor of LD 710 An Act to Fund the Lobster Legal Defense Fund.  Maine is 
the Lobster capital of the world, if we lose our iconic industry all of Maine will suffer. Lobster draws 
tourism dollars to our state. It is what drives tourists past beautiful quiet, Vermont, the 
breathtaking mountains of New Hampshire to the most eastern point of the United States to Maine. 
This committee approved these funds in the 130th legislature and we are asking they be renewed as 
this fight is going to be a long one.  We are not asking for General Fund dollars, these funds are paid 
by fishermen through their licensing fees.  A portion of licensing fees go to the Marketing 
Collaborative, please note this bill asks for a portion of those fees as it did before, not all of them. I 
would also like to highlight that the collaborative did some great work last year creating content 
that not only promoted Maine Lobster, but it also more importantly supported the industry and the 
good work fishermen do as stewards of their resource on the water every day.  We are sure it was 
tough working with less funds, I think in some capacity or another we are all doing that.  We feel 
this balance of funding both the collaborative, and the funding needed to defend our industry to 
keep us fishing is vital for Maine.  I’m sure you all have heard “A rising tide lifts all boats” by John F 
Kennedy, it certainly seems fitting today.  A healthy vibrant fishery is a healthy vibrant Maine 
economy.  Please join us and support LD 710 An Act to Fund the Lobster Legal Defense Fund.
Thank you,
Virginia Olsen
