LD 710
I'm writing to express my opposition to LD 710, An Act to Fund the Lobster Legal 
Defense Fund. The bill asks for $1 million over the next two fiscal years to support 
the lobster industry in their legal fight against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. In 2021, Maineâ€™s lobster industry set a record $725 million for the 
total value of lobsters brought to the docks. If the lobster industry persists in fighting 
the NOAA regulations to protect right whales (it's their choice to do so rather than 
simply implementing the changes required), they should pay for, and should be able 
afford, their own legal costs.
