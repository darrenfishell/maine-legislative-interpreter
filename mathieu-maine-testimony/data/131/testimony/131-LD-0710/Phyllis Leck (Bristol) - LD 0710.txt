Hello thank you for letting me testify today , 
I am in favor of spending our  tax dollars to help the lobstermen fight this battle 
I feel that more than just the Lobstermen will be impacted but also every industry in Maine 
We draw folks here for the romance and dedication these men and women face . It provides 
jobs in a lot of sectors 
I support the  legislation 
Thank you
