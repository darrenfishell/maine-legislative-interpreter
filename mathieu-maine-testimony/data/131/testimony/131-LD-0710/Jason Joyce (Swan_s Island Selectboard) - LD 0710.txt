Jason Joyce
Swan's Island Selectboard
LD 710
 Dear Members of the Marine Resources Committee, 
 I am writing in support of LD 710 and encourage your support to move this forward with 
unanimous support as ought to pass. As a selectboard member on Swan's Island, as a 
member of the Zone B council and as a multi generational lobsterman with over 200 years of 
family involvement in the lobster industry I understand that the future of our year-round 
coastal communities depends largely on the success of Maine's lobster Industry. 
 The funds allocated in this bill are crucial to our success in court especially after such a 
financially difficult year as 2022. Many fishermen have donated thousands in defense of the 
industry over the last 2 years but we cannot do it on our own.  Many associated business 
contributed as well over the last couple years but with rising inflation it may be a difficult time 
for all businesses to contribute.
 Considering the significant statewide economic stability that lobstering generates, many of 
Maine's lobstermen feel the state's contribution to our legal defense is warranted and 
welcomed. 
 Thank you for representing your districts and Maine's citizens with your service in Augusta.
 Sincerely, 
Jason Joyce -Swan's Island Selectman/ Zone B counsel member
