The importance of our ME DEP and IF&W working collaboratively to minimize 
potential impacts to endangered and threatened species habitat is imperative. 
Protecting grasslands and early succession forests, important habitats  for birds and 
bunnies is a must. In order to protect our beloved Maine Made quality of life these 
fragile lands must be safeguarded. We have massive amounts of land and 
development is a necessary aspect in maintaining a good quality of life. But we must 
allow every opportunity for our experts to  work together to protect these special 
areas. An Act to include Endangered and Threatened  Specie Habitat in the Definition
of "Significant Wildlife Habitat "Under the Natural Resources Protection Act. I hope 
to enjoy my McGrath Pond Camp Cottontail Rabbit that hops down my camp road 
every summer for many years to come! Thank you. Kimberly Hallee
