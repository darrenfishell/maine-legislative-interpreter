LD 1246
Dear Senator Brenner & Representative Gramlich and Members of the Committee:  
As you all know, our state is experiencing mounting development pressures.  Increased 
construction, particularly of second homes, is dramatically decreasing the availability of 
habitat for many species including those who are threatened or endangered. Please expand 
the DEP review process to include review of endangered and threatened species habitat 
during ALL project reviews.  Small modifications often can result in favorable outcomes for 
critical and vulnerable species such as Blanding’s turtle and New England cottontail.  Please 
pass LD 1246 to protect our state’s cherished and renowned biodiversity.  Thank you.
