Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Rob 
Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources at the Department of Environmental 
Protection, speaking in support of L.D. 1246 as amended by Rep. Gramlich in the 
proposed amendment circulated prior to the public hearing. The Department also 
requests one additional change to the wording of the proposed amendment, which is 
noted later in my testimony.

L.D. 1246: An Act to Include Endangered and Threatened Species Habitat in the Definition of ”Significant 
Wildlife Habitat" Under the Natural Resources Protection Act 
Testimony of: Rob Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources, DEP 
Public Hearing: April 5, 2023 
Page 2 of3 
As originally printed, L.D. 1246 would have required any person performing certain 
activities in, on or over state endangered or state threatened species habitat to first 
obtain a permit from the Department. Using currently available maps indicating potential 
habitat areas, some of which have not been field-verified, it appeared this could trigger 
requirements for a Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA) permit for many projects 
that are not currently required to obtain such a permit. While the department supports 
habitat protection, we were concerned about the increase in permit applications that 
would result from this new requirement. The Department ’s Land Bureau Licensing and 
Enforcement Divisions are stretched thin and cannot absorb such a substantial 
additional workload. 
The Department worked with agency partners, bill proponents and the bill sponsor, and 
we have agreed to the amended language, which we believe will limit new permitting 
requirements while still achieving much of the bill’s intended purpose. 
The amendment would require the Department to review a proposed project for impacts 
to state endangered and state threatened species habitat only if the activity or 
development must obtain a permit under NRPA or the Site Location of Development Act 
(Site Law), and it provides an exemption from this review for activities or development 
taking place on an individual residential lot that is not part of a multi-lot housing 
development. The department already sends Site Law applications to the Department of 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (DlF\/V) for review, including for review of impacts to state 
endangered and state threatened species habitat, so the amended bill would simply 
extend such review to projects that require a NRPA application. “Habitat for state 
endangered and state threatened species" would be defined by DIFW through major 
substantive rulemaking.

Wildlife Habitat" Under the Natural Resources Protection Act

The amendment similarly limits review for state endangered and state threatened 
species habitat to applications that are already coming in the door at the Land Use 
Planning Commission (LUPC), and it likewise exempts the LUPC’s residential use 
permits from this review. (The LUPC has provided written testimony to the Committee.) 
The amendment retains the bill's original intent to update the State’s performance 
standards for excavations and quarries to require avoidance of state endangered and 
state threatened species habitat. Under the original bill and the proposed amendment, if 
an excavation or quarry operation proposes to impact state endangered or state 
threatened species habitat, the operator would be required to obtain a NRPA permit for 
that portion of the activity. We expect these instances to be relatively infrequent, so we 
expect only a modest impact on Department staff. 
Lastly, as mentioned in the opening of my testimony, the Department requests one 
change to the wording of the proposed amendment, due to an unintentional oversight in 
the drafting of the amendment language. We request that the amendment should read 
as follows (requested deletion in ; requested addition in bold): 
(4) Habitat for state endangered and state threatened species listed under Title 12, 
section 12803, subsection 3 when anétpertien-ef the habitat is located within another 
protected natural resource or when any_portion of the habitat is contained within 
the boundaries of a project site that requires approval from: 
(a) The department pursuant to Title 38, Chapter 3, Articles 5-A, 6, 7 and 8-A, 
except for activities or development taking_place on a residential lot that is not 
pait of a proposed multi-lot housing development: or, 
_(b) The Land Use Planning Commission pursuant to Title 38, Chapter 3, Article 
5-A or Title 12, Chapter 206-A for subdivisions and non-residential uses. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. l am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.ǜ
