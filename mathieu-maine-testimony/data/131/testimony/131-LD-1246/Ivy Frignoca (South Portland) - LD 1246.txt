RE: Friends of Casco Bay Testimony in Support of LD 1246, An Act to 
Include Endangered and Threatened Species Habitat in the Definition of "Significant Wildlife  Habitat" Under the Natural Resources Protection Act  
 Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Committee,  
 Friends of Casco Bay submits this testimony in support of LD  1246, An Act to 
Include Endangered and Threatened Species Habitat in the Definition of 
"Significant Wildlife Habitat" Under the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA).  
 Friends of Casco Bay is a marine stewardship organization formed in 1989 to improve and protect the environmental health of Casco Bay. We monitor the health of Casco Bay, and use that data to inform our advocacy and engage our communities in efforts to protect the health of our w atershed . 
 We support LD 1246 with the recommended amendment. We support the  bill 
because it : (1) expands  NRPA by a ugmenting the definition of "significant wildlife 
habitat" to include habitat of state endangered and  threatened species and (2) 
requires the Department of Inland Fisheries and  Wildlife  (MDIFW) to define 
"habitat for state endangered and state threatened species" by major substantive rules.  The proposed amendment expands  review of impacts to threatened and 
endangered species habitat beyond NRPA permits, to reviews under Maine ’s Site  
Location of Development  law and to excavation and quarry permits .  
 In addition, t he propose d changes close a loophole. Now , Maine’s Department of Environmental 
Protection (M DEP ) must  only consult with MDIFW on strategies to avoid and minimize impacts to 
endangered and threatened species when proposed de velopment is  on 20 or more  acres. The majority  of 
development in the  Casco Bay watershed occurs on sit es less than 20 acres. The majority of harm to 
threatened and endangered species occurs from developments on sites less than 20 acres. Under current law, endangered and threatened species continue to lose  habitat.  
   
LD 1246 cures this defect. It removes the 20 -acre threshold . In the Casco Bay watershed, we 
believe this change will , at a minimum, help protect an d restore populations of endangered and 
threatened  Black -crowned Night Heron, New England Cottontail  and Spotted Turtle .  
 
The endangered B lack-crowned N ight H eron now has  only about  102 breeding individuals with 
nests on four coastal islands . We see these beautiful birds fishing along coastal Casco Bay near 
estuaries, stormwater retention ponds and freshwater roadside swales.  
 The N ew England Cottontail is Maine ’s only true native rabbit. It is  known to occur in just 6 
towns: Cape Elizabeth, Scarborough, Wells, York, Kittery, and Eliot . It has a statewide 
population of less than 300 individuals. As our water shed has transitioned from field, shrubland, 
and young forest habitats , New England Cottontails have lost  their upland and riparian habitat. 
This bill can help protect what remains and may have the potential to help restore habitat.  
 The threatened spotted turtle is a long -lived, attractive reptile  that does not reproduce until later 
in life . Because they do not reproduce early and prolifically, they are extra  vulnerable  to loss of 
habitat . They have dwindled in numbers due to habitat fragmentation, being killed during road 
crossings, and collection for use as pets. This bill could help them by better considering sites for 
roads and how to protect necessary habitat.  
 For these reasons, Friends of Casco Bay requests that this Committee vote that LD 1 246 Ought 
to Pass as amended. Thank you for considering our testimony.  Respectfully submitted,
