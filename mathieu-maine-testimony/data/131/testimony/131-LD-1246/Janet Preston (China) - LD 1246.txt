Box 6186, China Village, ME  04926 • (207) 861-1163 	April 1, 2023  Representative Katrina Smith 2 State House Station Augusta, ME  04330 Katrina.Smith@legislature.maine.gov   Dear Representative Smith,  I am writing in support of LD 1246 An Act to Include Endangered and Threatened Species Habitat in the Definition of “Significant Wildlife Habitat” Under the Natural Resource Protection Act.  I am on the Selectboard in China, and I am concerned that the new influx of people to Maine since Covid will have a negative effect on our wildlife.  I realize we need to accommodate new Mainers, and I am all for boosting the Maine economy, but it must be done in a way that does not threaten our endangered species.  To put our rare wildlife in danger would be counterproductive to our economy.  Most people move to Maine to escape the crowds, experience nature more easily, observe wildlife, and be closer to wilderness areas.  Maine is a unique gem among the states of our country.  Please support LD 1246 and help preserve and protect the very reason we all love living here.  Thank you for representing our views.  Sincerely,  Janet Preston
