Testimony
in
Support
of
LD

-
An
Act
to
Include
Endangered
and
Threatened
Species
Habitat
in
the
Definition
of
"Significant
Wildlife
Habitat"
Under
the
Natural
Resources
Protection
Act
Written

Apr 5, 2023
Dear
Members
of
the
Environment
and
Natural
Resources
Committee,
My
name
is
Tristan
Taber
and
I
am
a
resident
of
Bangor ,
ME.
I
am
asking
that
you
support
LD
1246,
a
bill
that
will
help
in
the
protection
of
habitat
critical
for
endangered
and
threatened
species
by
enacting
stronger
communication
and
coordination
between
the
Maine
Department
for
Environmental
Protection
and
Inland
Fisheries
and
Wildlife.
In
addition
to
being
a
concerned
citizen,
I
am
an
aquatic
ecologist
and
know
from
my
work
and
interactions
with
the
public
the
struggles
that
they
face
when
trying
to
protect
vital
speciesâ€™
habitats
in
their
area.
When
I
asked
what
recourse
a
community
member
has
who
is
concerned
about
the
loss
of
a
certain
flowering
plant
or
speckled
butterfly
as
a
large
development
project
moves
in
next
door.
I
am
saddened
to
say
to
them
that
there
is
little
that
can
be
done.
Many
residents
from
around
the
state
care
about
this
issue
and
the
permitting
process
needs
to
take
into
account
the
sensitive
species
of
Maine
and
the
habitats
they
rely
upon.
Development
is
important
in
the
growth
of
communities
and
I
am
not
arguing
for
ceasing
all
development.
What
I
am
urging
the
Members
of
the
Committee
to
support
is
improving
communication
between
two
of
our
most
significant
state
agencies
when
it
comes
to
natural
resources.
LD
1246
is
a
common-sense
solution.
Help
these
agencies
address
issues
in
the
early
stages
of
permitting
and
give
them
better
tools
to
protect
species
and
the
habitat
those
species
rely
upon.
Please
vote
to
support
LD
1246.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
this
important
bill.
Most
respectfully ,
Tristan
Taber
Aquatic
Scientist
