LD 1246
Dear Representative Gramlich and Members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee:
I appreciate the opportunity to submit my testimony electronically. 
My name is Ron Joseph. I'm a retired Maine wildlife biologist who spent three years 
working for the Maine Dept. of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and thirty years for the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I fully support 
LD 1246. I began my career in 1978 as an endangered species biologist in Augusta. 
Back then, Maine's bald eagle population was on the brink of vanishing from the 
state. I know firsthand the importance of protecting eagle habitat because it's how we, 
as a state, came together to rebuild Maine's dying eagle population. Maine has 
progressed from supporting  a few eagle pairs in the 1970s to several hundred today. 
The Maine Legislature deserves much credit for eagle population recovery by 
enacting laws to protect eagle nesting habitat. Enacting LD 1246 will ensure that 
Maine remains a national leader in protecting habitat for many other state threatened 
and endangered species, many of which aren't nearly as sexy as eagles but no less 
deserving of our help. 
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to remind the legislature that it stood tall in 
the 1970s to protect eagles, peregrine falcons, and other endangered species. Please 
proudly stand tall again by passing LD 1246. We owe it to the Maine's young 
generation who will one day thank you for your vision in protecting Maine's most 
vulnerable species.
