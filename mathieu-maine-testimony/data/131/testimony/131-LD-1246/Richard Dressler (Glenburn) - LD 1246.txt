Dear Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
 
Re: LD 1246 An Act to Include Endangered and Threatened Species Habitat in the 
Definition of “Significant Wildlife Habitat” Under the Natural Resources 
Protection Act 
 
My name is Richard Dressler and I am writing in support of LD 1246.  I am a resident of 
Glenburn and live year around on Pushaw Lake in Penobscot County. 
I am a retired wildlife biologist who worked for many years with Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife (MDIFW) mapping “Significant Wildlife Habitat” in Geographic Information 
Systems for protection under the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA).  We also 
worked with species specialists to map habitat for Threatened and Endangered 
Species.  Now is the time to take the next step to protect these habitats during all permit 
reviews. 
For proposed development on more than 20 acres, Maine Department of Environmental 
Protection (MDEP) is required to consult with MDIFW on strategies to avoid and 
minimize the impacts to endangered and threatened species. A jurisdictional gap 
between the agencies often prevents the consideration of these impacts in the review of 
applications for the smaller projects that make up the majority of development 
applications.  Lawmakers can now close this gap by modifying the Natural Resource 
Protection Act (NRPA) to ensure endangered and threatened species habitat is treated 
as a “Significant Wildlife Habitat,” just as lawmakers modified NRPA to better conserve 
vernal pools, waterfowl and wading bird habitat, and shorebird habitat approximately 15 
years ago. 
Please support this legislation to help protect our Threatened and Endangered Species. 
 
Richard Dressler
