Good
afternoon
Senator
Cur r y ,
Repr esentativ e
Rober ts,
and
members
of
the
joint
standing
committee
on
Inno vation,
De v elopment,
Economic
Advancement
and
Business.
My
name
is
J ob y
Tho yalil
and
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
Maine
Business
Immigration
Coalition
(MeBIC)
in
suppor t
of
LD
1169.
MeBIC
is
Maine’ s
onl y
r esour ce
dedicated
to
pr o viding
inf ormation,
education
and
adv ocacy
on
immigration
and
r elated
issues
fr om
the
business
and
economic
perspectiv e .
Maine ,
lik e
so
man y
par ts
of
the
countr y ,
is
experiencing
a
shor t-
and
long-term
w orkf or ce
shor tage
and
ther e
has
been
a
gr o wing
consensus
f or
y ears
that
immigrants
ar e
an
impor tant
par t
of
the
solution.
That’ s
wh y
in
2019,
the
Legislatur e
established
the
F or eign
Cr edentialing
and
Skills
Recognition
Re v olving
Loan
Pr ogram,
which
is
designed
to
pr o vide
inter est-fr ee
loans
to
immigrants
to
help
them
get
r eady
to
tak e
the
best,
highest
pa ying
jobs
the y
ar e
qualified
f or
once
the y
r eceiv e
their
w ork
permits.
Specificall y ,
the
pr ogram
was
designed
to
help
r ecipients
tak e
practical
steps
to war d
getting
“w ork-r eady . ”
F or
example ,
to
a ppl y
f or
a
job
that
r equir es
a
master's
degr ee ,
immigrants
often
need
to
ha v e
their
f or eign
educational
cr edentials
translated
if
not
in
English,
and
then
e valuated
b y
a
pr of essional
ser vice
to
establish
that
their
education
is
the
equivalent
of
a
U .S.
master's
degr ee .
This
can
cost
hundr eds
of
dollars.
Costs
not
unique
to
immigrant
job
a pplicants
ma y
also
be
co v er ed,
such
as
the
need
to
pa y
fingerprinting
f ees
f or
backgr ound
checks
to
w ork
in
public
schools,
or
f or
a
driv er's
license
to
be
able
to
driv e
either
to ,
or
f or ,
one's
job .
MeBIC
suppor ted
the
cr eation
of
the
loan
pr ogram
in
2019
because
w e
str ongl y
belie v e
that
Maine
needs
all
w orking
age
adults
living
her e
to
be
able
to
w ork
to
their
highest
potential.
W e
especiall y
sa w
the
need
f or
this
f or
immigrants
who
m ust
wait
man y
months
to
a
y ear
to
r eceiv e
w ork
authorization
fr om
the
f ederal
g o v ernment,
which
is
the
case
f or
people
seeking
asylum.
Asylum
seek ers
could
spend
that
time
taking
steps
to
get
r eady
f or
w ork,
but
those
steps
cost
mone y
and
without
being
able
to
w ork,
the y
ar e
caught
in
a
Catch-22.
j t h o y a l i l @ a m e r i c a n b i c . b i z ,

W e
w er e
disma y ed
to
learn
that
the
loan
pr ogram
isn't
being
utilized,
but
w e
understand
people's
hesitance
to
tak e
out
an y
kind
of
loan
when
the y
don't
y et
ha v e
a
job
or
kno w
what
their
income
will
be
-
no
matter
ho w
lo w-cost
the
loan
ma y
be .
That
is
wh y
w e
v er y
m uch
suppor t
this
bill
to
turn
the
loan
into
a
grant
and
w e
see
it
as
a
practical
fix
to
the
pr ogram.
W e
belie v e
this
w ould
alle viate
people's
a ppr ehension,
incr ease
uptak e ,
and
help
achie v e
the
original
g oals
of
the
pr ogram,
of
ha ving
mor e
Maine
r esidents
able
to
w ork
at
their
highest
potential,
which
w ould
clearl y
benefit
those
individuals
and
their
families,
as
w ell
as
Maine
businesses
and
the
econom y
as
a
whole .
I
