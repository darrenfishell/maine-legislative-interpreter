Statement of Support to LD 1817 
An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor School for All 
Maine Studénts Program 
May 10, ~2023 
Hello, my name is Wyatte Damon and I am a 6th grader at Agnes Gray Elementary 
in West Paris. I know fust hand about the beneﬁts of outdoor learnmg and what 
programs like this can do for students 
It was one of the last nights we were at camp. We were out near the beach inaN 
small group. Qur counselors had us standing in a group in the dark. I was really 
excited: I had never done anything like this before. I kept thinking about how lucky 
I Was. Our counselor brought out 5 small telescopes. Looking through a telescope, 
I was able to see the Intemational Space Station, Jupiter and about a million stars. 
During this experience I felt‘ excitement and a desire to keep looking for more This 
was just one experience I had at camp that week? But that excitement and desire to 
do and learn more was what I felt during the whole week. I would notghave had this 
experience if it were not for a scholarship to attend Camp Susan Curtis last 
summer. -.

When I go to camp I feel safe and happy I feel safe because the staﬁ‘ is trained to 
keep. me physically safe as well as emotionally. I want every student in Maine to 
have this experience. To go somewhere where they leam new things about nature 
and themselves, trytthings for the fn'st time and feel‘ supported. The "coiiﬁdence that 
I build at camp comes back to school with me and has made me a better student 
and person. ~
