Dear members of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee,
Both of my adult children and I teach outdoor science, nature and ecology with 
students. My daughter in Freeport takes her 2 year old preschoolers outside almost 
daily year round. My son teaches young children outside in his village in Ladakh, 
India. He and his partner also recently shared outdoor teaching methods with teachers 
of all ages students in the large city of Kargil, Ladakh. I volunteer doing outdoor 
science activities at Woodside Elementary School in Topsham. At Cathance River 
Educational Alliance summer camp, I am a volunteer naturalist helping excited kids 
identify mammal droppings, minerals, salamanders, frogs and turtles by species. The 
huge variety of living things, and weather, while using ones' bodies helps kids focus, 
develop their curiosity and enjoy learning.
