Good mormng Senator Ingwersen, Representatrve Pluecker, and fellow members on the 
Agnculture, Conservat1on, and Forestry Commlttee, I am Senator Russ Black of Wrlton andI 
proudly represent the good people of Franklm, Somerset, and Kennebec Countres 1n D1str1ct 5I 
am pleased to prov1de testrmony 1n support and be a cosponsor of LD 1817, "An Act to Support 
Outdoor Educatron by Establrshmg the Outdoor School for All Mame Students Program” 
As most of you know, I am a fanner and a logger by trade, and own Black Acres Farm m Wrlton, 
whrch specralrzes 1n grass-fed beef cattle and hogs, as well as maple syrup Not only do I love 
the work that I do, I am equally as proud of the rmpact our farm has on our commumty and the 
surroundrng reg1on Supportmg commumty 1s so rmportant to me and 1t 1s a lens I look through 
when consrderrng pol1cy proposals m Augusta Thrs 1s one of many reasons I support LD 1817 
The rmpact of outdoor educatron programs extends far beyond the classroom They po s1t1vely 
beneﬁt workforce development, an 1ssue that lawmakers drscuss darly as to what we can do to 
prov1de the r1ght envrromnent for our younger generatrons to have career opportumtres herem 
Mame that supports our nature-based economy By mtroducmg students to outdoor educatronal 
exper1ences at an early age, we can expose clnldren to a world of poss1b111t1es of future _]ObS 1n 
the areas of agrrculture, forestry, conservatron and envrromnental scrence 
We can look to other states that have outdoor educatron school programs avarlable statewrde to 
therr students to see the lastmg rmpact these programs have had beyond the nnddle school years 
In states hke Oregon and Washmgton, students who partlcrpated m outdoor school programs 
have contmued that 1nterest m outdoor and envrromnental educatron Some students have 
pursued teachmg outdoor school programs whrle 1n lngh school and then have contmued w1th 
nature-based Jobs m later years And m Oregon, they have experrenced full-tune employment 
drrectly related wrth these multl-day, overmght outdoor educatlon school programs Flgures 
show that outdoor school programmmg annually supports more than 600 _]0bS and more than $27

m1ll1on of mcome 1n Oregon Although Ma1ne’s populatron 1s approxnnately one-th1rd of 
Oregon’s, We could expect hundreds of _]ObS and m1ll1ons of dollars pumped rnto our state’s 
economy Those are real _]ObS, beneﬁttmg Mame people, and they are _]ObS that are a natural ﬁt to 
what makes Marne such a Sp6C18.l place to l1ve

horseshoe today Thank you for supportmg opportmnues to provrde Mame students w1th
