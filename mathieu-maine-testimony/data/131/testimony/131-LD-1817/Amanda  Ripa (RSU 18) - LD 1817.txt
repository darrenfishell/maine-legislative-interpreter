Learning can happen outdoors! I have taught middle school science for 11 years. Each
year I make it a goal to bring my classes outside as much as possible and integrate 
outdoor learning into my yearly curriculum. Almost every topic I teach can be 
connected to our natural world or, can be taught outside. I would love for all middle 
school students to have a chance for a life-changing learning experience at one of 
Maineâ€™s renowned outdoor learning centers! This would connect our students to our 
amazing natural resources in our state and to help build a culture of stewardship 
within our youth.
