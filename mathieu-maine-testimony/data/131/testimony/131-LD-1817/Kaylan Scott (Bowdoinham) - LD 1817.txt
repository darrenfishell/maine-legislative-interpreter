Senator Ingwersen, Representatlve Pluecker, and members of the d1st1ngu1shed 
Comm1ttee on Agnculture, Conservatlon, and Forestry My name 1s Kaylan Scott 
I l1ve 1n the Town of Bowdolnham I am submlttmg testlmony 1n support of LD 
1817 
As an outdoor educator and program admlmstrator, I have seen ﬁrsthand how 
these outdoor school experlences support a ch11d's educatlonal and emotlonal 
development The relat1onsh1ps forged durmg multl-day programs at outdoor 
schools—w1th teachers, peers, and the natural world—are transfonnatronal Our 
teacher partners routmely comment on the 1mpactth1s relat1onsh1p bu1ld1ng has on 
the rest of the1r academrc year, and beyond I can personally attest to that 
phenomenon the path that led me to stand up here today started at an outdoor 
school when I was a mlddle school student 
In add1t1on to the student and teacher beneﬁts of outdoor schools, LDl8l7 
represents a remarkable opportumty to support workforce development I 
personally manage the h1r1ng of 11- 16 outdoor educators each year These skllled 
professronals can be challenglng to recrurt and retarn glven the seasonal nature of 
the work Many of our employees, 1nclud1ng natrve Ma1ners, must leave the state 
they love 1n order to ﬁnd meamngful employment throughout the year LDl8l7 
w11l provrde more secunty and pred1ctab1l1ty to the1r work, perm1tt1ng outdoor 
educators to put roots down 1n the state of Ma1ne The1r employment allows them 
to partlclpate 1n the local econom1es and brmg vlbrancy and expertlse to our 
commun1t1es 
For me, th1s matter 1s cr1t1cal both to the ﬁeld I care so much about and to my 
famlly Whlle I’ve been able to obtam year-round employment 1n the outdoor 
educatron mdustry, my partner and s1ster, both outdoor educators, contmue to 
navrgate the unrel1able landscape of seasonal work 1n Mame LD1817 would 
lncrease the number of students able to attend outdoor schools, and that re11ab1l1ty 
could provlde more and more consrstent opportumtles for my famlly and the 
many other passlonate Mame-based outdoor educators 
I would ask you to support LD 1818 and vote to pass th1s b1ll Thank you to the 
sponsor for brlngrng th1s b1ll forward and thank you to the commlttee members
