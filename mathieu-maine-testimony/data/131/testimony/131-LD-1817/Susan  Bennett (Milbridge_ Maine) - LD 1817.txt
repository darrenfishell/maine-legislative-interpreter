LD 1817
I was disturbed to learn about LD1817 and its focus on only overnight outdoor 
experiences for children. Having had a child in MSAD37 who benefitted from 
outdoor opportunities through the school in our community, I can tell you how 
meaningful those regular outdoor learning experiences have been. 
I strongly advocate funding for outdoor education. What we know about outdoor 
experiences and mental health supports this as well. However, school districts should 
have the latitude to secure the outdoor experiences that best support the children in 
their community. 
Only funding organizations with overnight facilities is counterintuitive to providing 
students with regular opportunities in their home region. Our rural community does 
not have overnight options close by. Therefore, transporting our children - if they 
continue to receive these outdoor education experiences - will be more expensive. I 
would rather see more of the funds spent on regular outdoor education experiences 
than transportation and housing. It sounds very sustainable - especially when we have 
an excellent outdoor education program in our community. 
Please reconsider this bill and shape it so that school districts may utilize 
programming in their communities in the broadest sense.
