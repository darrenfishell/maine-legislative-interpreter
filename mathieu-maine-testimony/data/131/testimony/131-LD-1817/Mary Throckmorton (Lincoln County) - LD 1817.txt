LD 1817
Good morning Chairs and committee members,
I am writing to ask you to OPPOSE LD 1817
 An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor School for All 
Maine Students Program.
The intent of this bill is to increase hunting by exposing young children to 
"'education" about Maine "Traditions".
In this day and age, many parents do NOT want their children playing with guns. 
They don't agree with hunting for recreation. This bill is an attempt to over ride the 
will of parents in the education of their children.
I would like to remind you that it "outdoor policy"  not to manage wildlife for the 
benefit of ecosytems, which are the controlling force in managing climate change, but
to make available as many target species as possible to the detriment of other species.
These sort of "traditions" have led to ponds being overtaken by introduced fish, 
whether legally by MDIFW or illegally by sportsmen. There is so much fishing 
pressure that MDIFW raises and releases certain fish just so fishermen can catch 
them.
There is a Statewide attempt to eradicate predators, who are an integral part of a 
healthy ecosystem-along with the myth that by doing so they are "saving the deer". A 
management system which has led to the lack of deer up North and overpopulation in 
the South.
This undermines any attempt by science minded and environmentally aware parents 
to teach their children to respect nature and ecosystems, and it is an attempt by the 
NRA and SAM to gain support for future legislation by brainwashing young children 
to their "preferred methods."
Please oppose LD 1817  An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the 
Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program.
