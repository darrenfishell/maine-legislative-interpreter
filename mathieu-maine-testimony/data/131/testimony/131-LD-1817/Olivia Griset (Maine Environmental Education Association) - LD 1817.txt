RE: LD 1817 - An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor 
School for All Maine Students Program 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
My name is Olivia Griset and I am the Executive Director of the Maine 
Environmental Education Association (MEEA) I am here to testify in support of LD 
1817. Thank you to Senator Brenner and Representative Carlow for bnngmg this bill 
fonivard, along with the many cosponsors and other supporters including members of 
this committee 
MEEA is a nonproﬁt statewide professional network representing over 1,500 
Maine educators, including classroom teachers as well as community-based educators 
at libraries, museums, ovemight environmental education program providers and 
science and nature centers For over forty years we have supported Maine educators in 
providing high quality, locally relevant, hands-on outdoor experiences for Maine youth 
l speak in support of this bill both in my professional role and also as a former 
teacher and a parent 
As a teacher in a town iust 45 minutes from the ocean, l took a bus full of 
students to Reid State Park for a marine biology ﬁeld trip I'll never forget my surprise 
when so many students who had grown up in Maine had never seen or experienced the 
ocean Others had never seen the mountains 
This program will ensure our kids, whether or not their families have funds to 
travel, will get to see and experience what Maine has to offer Research and ﬁrsthand 
experience shows the critical years around middle school are a key window for physical, 
social, and mental health development This IS when kids start thinking about their 
futures, possible career pathways and their beliefs about the place they call home 
When our youth get to have positive community-based learning expenences they gaina
greater sense of place and connection to this state, making it more likely they will want 
to stay here to pursue careers, contribute to the Maine economy, raise their families, 
and participate in their local communities 
Maine is known as a national leader in outdoor and environmental education We 
are unique for our nch history of outdoor recreation, natural resource-based economy, 
and the existing infrastructure enabling the state to provide a high quality, locally 
relevant outdoor school program for every Maine child This program will increase jObS 
in the outdoor learning sector statewide, while at the same time exposing our youth to 
many potential careers in the outdoor recreation, natural sciences, green jobs, and 
STEM ﬁelds 
Finally, I Wl|| speak from my heart in support of this bill as a parent The past few 
years have been really hard on Maine kids My own young daughters had 18 months of 
leaming completely upended by COVID They lost so many social interactions and 
social skills in the process, leaming over zoom, isolated and scared Both of my kids 
are still healing, l see them most at peace and at their best when they are off their 
screens and outside Maine’s kids are not ok, we are seeing unprecedented levels of 
anxiety and depression in our youth and we have to act This program would be a way 
for all Maine kids, not just the kids whose families or schools can afford it, to access 
transformative, nature-based learning experiences that center social and emotional 
leaming and connection 
For all these reasons, I urge you to support LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor 
Education by Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program
