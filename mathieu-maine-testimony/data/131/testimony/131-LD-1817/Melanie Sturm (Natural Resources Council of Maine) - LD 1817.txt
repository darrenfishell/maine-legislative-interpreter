Students Program

Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and  members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, I am Melanie Sturm, the Forests and Wildlife Director at the 
Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM). I appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony in 
support of LD 1817.  
 
LD 1817 w ould ensure that every middle school student in Maine has the chance  to get outside at one of 
Maineâ€™s outdoor learning centers . The bill would establish t he Outdoor School for All Maine Students 
Program  to provide  immersive outdoor learning experiences for all Maine students in grades 4 through 
8. The program would be administered by  The University of Maine Cooperative Extension in partnership  
with outdoor education programs.  
 
NRCM  strongly believe s everyone shoul d have access to the outdoors because of the many benefits of 
being outside and learning in nature. However,  not everyone today has access to the outdoors  due to  
differences  in economics, school reso urces, race, geography, and  other factors. W hile Maine is known 
for its land, water , and wildlife  and we are fortunate to have trails through the state , some youth  face 
barriers to getting outside . LD 1817 would help  addre ss that issue. There are myriad benefits to health 
and well -being of being outdoors, and f ostering a love of place at a young age can cultivate a 
stewardship ethic and environmental values that last a lifetime. When  you love something, you want to 
protect  it. LD 1817  provides an opportunity to invest in our children and the future of the state.   
 
We respectfully urge the Committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1817. Thank you for your time and 
consideration .
