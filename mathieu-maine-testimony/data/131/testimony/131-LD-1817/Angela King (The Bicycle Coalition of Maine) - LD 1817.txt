On
behalf
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
I
am
submitting
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1817
“An
Act
to
Support
Outdoor
Education
by
Establishing
the
Outdoor
School
for
All
Maine
Students
Program”
The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
is
the
statewide
organization
that
advocates
for
bicyclists
and
pedestrians.
W e
work
to
make
Maine
better
for
bicycling
and
walking,
and
to
protect
the
safety
and
rights
of
vulnerable
users
of
the
public
ways.
Our
work
in
advocacy ,
education,
and
events
is
to
encourage
people
to
be
outdoors
walking
and
biking
for
recreation
and
transportation.
The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
supports
LD
1817
to
establish
the
Outdoor
School
for
All
Maine
Students.
Over
the
past
several
years,
we
have
all
been
reminded
about
the
importance
of
access
to
safe
places
to
be
outside
and
the
positive
physical
and
mental
health
that
comes
from
spending
time
outdoors.
At
the
BCM,
the
demand
for
our
on-bike
education
work
grows
each
year–signaling
to
us
the
energy
around
bicycle
education
and
access
has
not
waned.
A
program
to
ensure
all
students
in
Maine
have
access
to
outdoor
education
can
help
meet
the
needs
of
students
across
the
state.
Currently ,
less
than
25%
of
Maine
students
get
to
participate
in
outdoor
school
programs.
LD
1817
would
help
to
ensure
equitable
access
for
all
Maine
students
by
removing
outdoor
school
funding
barriers
and
allowing
the
distribution
of
grant
funding.
Outdoor
education
programs
have
proven
to
build
stronger
relationships
between
students
and
teachers.
The
positive
ef fect
of
that
will
benefit
all
their
education.
A
nd
for
students
to
experience
the
benefits
of
Maine’ s
beautiful
outdoors,
they
may
be
inspired
to
continue
to
learn
more
about
the
natural
environment
as
a
career
path,
build
a
life-long
commitment
to
active
living,
and
an
appreciation
for
stewarding
our
lands
and
waters.
Because
of
these
reasons,
the
BCM
urges
an
Ought
to
Pass
vote
on
this
bill.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
service
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
Angela
King
Advocacy
Manager
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
