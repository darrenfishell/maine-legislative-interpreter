LD 1817
I am one of the 90% of Mainers who neither hunts nor traps and opposes the use of 
public funds (some $12,000,000 annually according to DIFW) to promote practices to
school children that many regard as cruel.
For instance, the Sierra Club, founded in 1892 and one of the pioneers in land 
preservation with nearly 4,000.000 members nation-wide, has this to say about 
trapping:
"The use of body-gripping devices* – including leghold traps, snares, and Conibear® 
traps – are indiscriminate to age, sex and species and typically result in injury, pain, 
suffering, and/or death of target and non-target animals. 
The Sierra Club considers body-gripping, restraining and killing traps and snares to be
ecologically indiscriminate and unnecessarily inhumane and therefore opposes their 
use. The Sierra Club promotes and supports humane, practical and effective methods 
of mitigating human-wildlife conflicts and actively discourages the use of inhumane 
and indiscriminate methods. "
For these reasons, I urge the committee to vote ONTP on LD 1817.
