I am a high school educator in Maine. I have seen first hand the impact of outdoor 
education on my students. For four years, we have partnered with the Hurricane 
Island Center for Science and Leadership to give Oceanside's STEM and Liberal Arts 
Academy students the opportunity to experience learning in an outdoor space - doing 
field research in intertidal zones, dissecting scallops right along the shoreline, sorting 
and recording scallop spat on the wharf, and even developing writing inspired by the 
rich Maine setting that surrounds us. We have have had this opportunity because of 
the generosity of grants we have received from various organizations. This year we 
are incorporating art in our outdoor experience as well, as we allow the science we are
doing to inform our creativity. We even have begun to deploy our own scallop spat 
bags - the placement of the bags is student decided and the retrieval and data 
assessment is done by students as well. Our outdoor educational experience has been 
transformational - creating engaged and informed students who appreciate far more 
the beauty of our home state and the unique opportunities that our outdoor landscape 
offers for learning.  With what our state as to offer, I believe every student should 
have the opportunity to access learning outside of the four walls of their classroom.
