My name 1s Lydla McAl1ster and I attend Agnes Gray Elementary School m West_Par1s as well 
Students at our school are forttmate to spend parts of our school day learmng outs1de Bemg 
outs1de cahns people, glves us a chance to move, talk w1th each other about our learmng, and 
observe the world around us We know other students do not have th1s option We have also both 
beneﬁted from attendlng outdoor camp programs through tnps paid for by school; scholarshlps, 
and our fam1l1es paymg for tultlon ~"
Q 
Havmg these *0pp0I'tL1I11t16S 1s expens1ve I know when students go home and ask thelr parents 1f 
they can go to camp or on anfexcltlng ovennght tr1p, the1r hopes are hlgh, they want to be 
outs1de They want to be learmng new sk1lls, trymg new tlnngs But the1r parents have to say, 
‘no’ The cost 1s Just too hlgh 
Last summer I attended archery camp at Bryant Pond The only way I was able to go wasA 
because my parents had planned and saved for 1t through the whole year. They put asldp a part of 
every paycheck each week and I added to 1t from my sav1ngs account I feel very lucky that my 
parents made th1s comm1trnent I know they knew how 1mportant It was‘ for me to attend Bryant 
PondI 
If th1s b1ll passes, parents W111 not have to worry about how to provlde these amazmg 
opportumtres for the1r Ch.lldI‘C1'l They W111 not have to say ‘no’ or make sacnﬁces each week All 
klds m Mame W111 have the chance to try somethmg for the ﬁrst tlme, leam new SkllIS, feel safe 
and supported, and bmld conﬁdence that'they can brmg back to school and use the rest of thelr 
l1ves - t‘
