Moving our class to outdoor learning had wide, exponential benefits for all children. 
Shy children related to peers in other ways, rambunctious children became leaders, 
and everyone was able to learn at their own level. We enhanced story telling skills, 
gained science knowledge and vocabulary, enhanced social literacy skills, and gained 
a wealth of information about the natural world. Parents sang our praises and are so 
thankful for our outdoor learning time. Outdoor learning should not stop in 
elementary school- middle schoolers need it as well!
