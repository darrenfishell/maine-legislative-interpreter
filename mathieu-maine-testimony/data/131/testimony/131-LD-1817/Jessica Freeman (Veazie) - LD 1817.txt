Outdoor education is important at all levels of learning, not only does this allow 
students to have an outlet for their energy, it allows children in all levels of learning to
be able to participate. Students have the opportunity to build real world knowledge 
and how it can be applied. Being in nature provides positive peer interaction, 
communication, collaboration as well as critical thinking.
