LD 1817
Dear Committee Members,
My name is Helen Jolley and I am testifying in support of LD 1817 - An Act To 
Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor School For All Maine 
Students Program. As a PE & Health Teacher and Outdoor Club Advisor at Conners 
Emerson School in Bar Harbor, I have witnessed firsthand how outdoor education can
change the lives of our young people. I believe all Maine students deserve the 
opportunity to experience the benefits of outdoor education. 
Growing up in Oregon, I participated in the state-wide Outdoor School program as a 
6th grade student and I returned as a high school volunteer counselor, all at no cost to 
my family. It was an incredible and life changing experience. The hands-on learning 
opportunities gave me a new understanding of my science classes, and started a 
lifelong love of the outdoors. Today, in my role as the Outdoor Club advisor, I often 
observe that my students who participate in outdoor learning are more engaged in 
classes and have better school attendance records. They have a deeper appreciation 
for Maineâ€™s natural beauty and they are more interested in caring for their 
environment. 
Every student should experience the benefits of outdoor education, especially in a 
state with such a rich outdoor heritage. Yet less than a quarter of Maine middle school
students are able to access an Outdoor School program. Lower-income and rural 
schools are more affected. LD 1817 will bridge the gap and create opportunities for 
every Maine middle school student to gain an appreciation for nature. You have a 
chance to improve the lives of every Maine middle school student. Thank you for 
considering this important opportunity. 
Sincerely,
Helen Jolley
