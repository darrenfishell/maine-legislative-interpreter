Before
the
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry
May
15,
2023
Senator
Ingwersen
,
Representative
Pluecker
,
and
members
of
the
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry:
My
name
is
Kathleen
Meil
and
I
serve
as
Senior
Director
of
Policy
&
Partnerships
at
Maine
Conservation
V oters.
Our
or ganization
represents
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters
dedicated
to
protecting
Maine’ s
environment
and
our
democracy .
T oday ,
that
means
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1817,
“
An
Act
to
Support
Outdoor
Education
by
Establishing
the
Outdoor
School
for
All
Maine
Students
Program
.”
A
few
days
at
one
of
Maine’ s
outdoor
learning
centers
can
be
transformative
for
middle
school
students,
providing
hands-on,
holistic,
interdisciplinary
learning
focused
on
science
and
nature,
and
connecting
outdoor
recreation
with
environmental
stewardship,
natural
resource
management,
and
Maine’ s
economy .
Students
build
self-suf ficiency
and
leadership
skills
through
the
healthy
challenges
that
come
with
an
outdoor
living
experience,
and
schools
participating
in
Outdoor
School
programs
report
improvements
in
attendance
and
retention
rates.
At
a
time
when
so
many
of
our
young
people
struggle
with
overwhelming
isolation
and
mental
health
challenges,
outdoor
school
experiences
outside
the
traditional
classroom
allow
students
and
teachers
to
see
each
other
in
a
new
light,
building
trust
and
strong
relationships.
Earlier
this
year ,
Maine
Conservation
V oters
hosted
leaders
from
the
Maine
Outdoor
School
For
All
campaign
for
a
virtual
Lunch
&
Learn.
(Y ou
can
view
the

.)
After
hearing
about
outdoor
schools,
the
national
momentum
around
nature-based
education,
and
the
promise
of
LD
1817,
one
participant
commented,
“Ther e
r eally
isn’ t
a
case
against
outdoor
schools,
is
ther e?”
Y et
fewer
than
a
quarter
of
Maine
middle
school
students
have
the
opportunity
to
connect
with
our
natural
heritage
thr ough
an
outdoor
school
pr ogram.

LD
1817
would
support
all
students
in
4th
through
8th
grades
to
spend
two
nights
and
three
days
at
an
outdoor
learning
center
and
ensure
that
the
experience
would
be
integrated
with
school
curriculum
and
aligned
with
state
learning
standards
so
we
can
get
children
outside
connecting
with
Maine’ s
outdoor
heritage.
Students,
teachers,
and
our
entire
community
would
benefit
from
equitably
extending
this
powerful
experience
to
all
Maine
students.
For
these
reasons,
Maine
Conservation
V oters
supports
LD
1817
and
respectfully
ur ges
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass.”
Thank
you.
