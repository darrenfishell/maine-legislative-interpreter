T o
Whom
it
May
Concern,
I
am
writing
in
support
of
the
Act
to
Support
Outdoor
Education
by
Establishing
the
Outdoor
School
for
All
Maine
Students
Program.
I
have
worked
with
Maine
youth
in
a
wide
variety
of
outdoor
and
experiential
learning
settings,
from
sea
kayak
expeditions
along
the
Maine
Coast
to
science
explorations
in
the
backyard
of
a
middle
school.
In
all
of
these
settings,
I
have
seen
students
more
engaged
in
their
learning,
more
connected
to
their
peers,
and
more
curious
about
the
world
around
them.
My
observations
are
supported
by
a
wealth
of
academic
research
which
demonstrates
the
positive
impacts
of
experiential
learning
on
studentsâ€™
academic,
social-emotional,
and
behavioral
development.
Unfortunately ,
immersive
outdoor
learning
opportunities
are
not
accessible
to
all
students
because
of
financial
constraints
and
transportation
logistics.
It
is
challenging
for
families
to
af ford
to
send
their
children
to
these
programs.
Similarly ,
school
district
budgets
are
often
stretched
thin
so
these
experiences
are
only
an
option
with
extensive
community
fundraising.
I
hope
you
will
consider
supporting
this
unique
opportunity
to
provide
greater
access
to
meaningful
learning
experiences
for
youth
in
Maine.
I
believe
students,
teachers,
and
families
across
the
state
will
benefit
from
this
initiative.
Thank
you
for
your
time.
Sincerely ,
