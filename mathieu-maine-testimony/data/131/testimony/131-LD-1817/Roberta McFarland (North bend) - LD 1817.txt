 I support LD 1817 Outdoor School for All Maine Students.  I am a resident of 
Washington State, we passed Outdoor School for All legislation last year with bi 
partisan support.  This year approximately 1/2 of our eligible students across our state 
are immersed in overnight outdoor environmental education with their classmates.  A 
game changer for not only our urban students but our rural students as well.  
Community building and ecological knowledge gained firsthand is having a profound 
impact on their sense of self as a community member.
Every student needs a week in nature across our country, Maine would be joining 
Oregon and Washington in providing a high-quality educational experience for their 
citizens.
