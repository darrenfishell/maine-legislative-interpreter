LD 1817
I urge you to fully support LD 1817 - An Act to Support Outdoor Education by 
Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program. I've experienced 
first hand - as an educator, and as a parent - the myriad benefits of outdoor education. 
I worked as an instructor in the Appalachian Mountain Club's Mountain Classroom 
and witnessed middle school students from cities exploring forests and gazing at stars 
for the very first time. My children have attended summer programs at Bryant Pond 
Camp and my eldest has had the unique opportunity to be in the Maine Environmental
Science Academy (MESA) program at Molly Ockett School in Fryeburg, where two 
days a week they embark on outdoor field trips with the Greater Lovell Land Trust 
and Tin Mountain Conservation Center. They learn so much more during these 
experiential programs than they ever do in an indoor classroom. With LD 1817, these 
types of programs would be available to all children in Maine! Thank you.
