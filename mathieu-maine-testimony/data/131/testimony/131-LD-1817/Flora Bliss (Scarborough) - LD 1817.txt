Students Program 
May 10, 2023 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the distinguished 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry My name is Flora Bliss I live in 
Scarborough I am here to speak in support of LD 1817 - An Act to Support Outdoor 
Education by Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program 
I grew up on my parents farm In late fall my father and I would put on heavy jackets 
and boots and don bright orange caps and tromp out to the edge of our ﬁelds We would 
step into the woods where the leaves had fled their branches and now crunched 
underfoot and where the hardiest of the songbirds still lingered I have vivid memories of 
the sun shining through the bare canopy of forest and the way the rivulets of tree bark 
felt under my fingers 
I would collect the best acorns and load my pockets with them, to be discovered later 
and unloaded onto the kitchen table I would creep down to the river and test the ice, 
ﬁnding it held I would lay for long minutes on the hard surface watching the water carry 
little bits of moss and guessing at where the frogs had buried themselves und r the 
chilly mud Somedays, I would walk to the old graveyard way back in the woods where 
a previous farm fam|Iy’s remains rest There is a small clearing lined with gnarled fruit 
trees and cattails taller than me I would make up stories about the mysterious people 
and imagine their lives, and what their children had been like I would explore the ruins 
of their burned down farmhouse and barn and collect little trinkets like rusted out 
wrenches and wheel spokes, to be stashed with the acorns 
I have a deep appreciation for this planet we live on, and I believe this appreciation 
formed in those moments when I counted tadpoles in the vernal pools, when I climbed 
to the highest branches of our huge ashtree, and when I sat in the waterfall and let the 
water run through my toes 
I hope that someday every child will have the opportunity to appreciate moments like 
these By passing this bill, we will open the door for kids who would not all normally be 
able to see the outdoors, giving the youngest generations access to appreciate nature 
This will mean that as they grow up, our children will have a sense of what the natural 
world can offer A next generation willing to take on the work of farming, fishing and
envrronmehtal stewardshrp rs what Marne needs I myself know that I want to spend my 
career outdoors, wlth my hands |n the so|I surrounded by I|fe, and |t was my ch|Idhood 
experrences that have swayed me to be a farmer 
As a young person I stand here and Implore my elders to take th|s next step In 
accessrbllrty for all 
Thank you
