May 9, 2023  Dear dis0nguished members of the Commi;ee on Agriculture, Conserva0on and Forestry in the 131st Maine Legislature,  My name is Lauren Jacobs and I am a resident of Old Town. I am wri0ng in support of LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Educa0on by Establishing the Outdoor School of All Maine Students Program.  I am a faculty member of the University of Maine, where I teach in and coordinate our Outdoor Leadership program. I am submiPng this tes0mony as an individual ci0zen, albeit one with extensive instruc0onal, ﬁeld, and research experience in outdoor educa0on and outdoor learning.  Outdoor ac0vi0es and outdoor learning are incredibly powerful tools to support children’s cogni0ve, physical, and mental wellbeing. Many of us know this intui0vely and anecdotally, but it is also backed up by decades of research.  Unfortunately, even though we live in “Vaca0onland,” not every child in Maine has the same access to outdoor experiences. My research has demonstrated that outdoor opportuni0es – including recess, outdoor ac0vi0es in physical educa0on classes, and outdoor learning experiences such as school gardens – vary signiﬁcantly between schools, districts, and in diﬀerent parts of the state. And when we rely on extra-curricular programming to deliver things like outdoor opportuni0es, some children will never be able to par0cipate.   I believe that every Maine student should have access to life-enhancing outdoor experiences. And I believe that because these experiences are so fundamental and beneﬁcial to wellbeing and learning, they should be a part of public-school curriculum and available to all.   LD 1817 is a great step forward towards bringing all of Maine’s children into our beau0ful outdoors. Thank you for your 0me, and please join me in suppor0ng this legisla0on.   Sincerely,     Lauren Jacobs
