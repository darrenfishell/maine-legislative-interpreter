I
am
an
outdoor
education
and
high
school
English
teacher .
I
am
finding
that
the
students
that
I
have
in
outdoor
education
love
starting
their
day
outside
working
on
skills
that
they
may
already
have
or
are
interested
in.
They
feel
as
though
starting
the
day
with
fresh
air
makes
them
more
refreshed
and
ready
to
sit
in
a
classroom
to
do
work.
I
also
implement
my
outdoor
teaching
in
my
high
school
English
classroom.
The
students
use
outdoor
connections
to
stories
we
have
read
and
work
on
a
project
out
in
the
woods
around
our
school.
They
also
do
some
work
in
our
outdoor
classrooms
as
well
as
collaborative
work
with
some
of
our
elementary
students
outside
being
mentors.
The
English
students
are
finding
their
strengths
and
working
on
the
things
they
are
not
confident
with.
Some
are
stepping
out
of
their
comfort
zone
by
collaborating
with
others
they
normally
wouldnâ€™t
because
of
the
outdoor
piece.
My
students
are
much
more
confident
and
feel
a
sense
of
accomplishment
because
of
their
time
outdoors.
They
are
mentally
ready
for
the
day
when
they
can
get
outside
and
explore
or
just
enjoy
the
outside
activities.
