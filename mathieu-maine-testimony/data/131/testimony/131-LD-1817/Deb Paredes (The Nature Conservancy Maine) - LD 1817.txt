RE: LD 1817 — An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor School 
for All Maine Students Program 
Senator lngwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Deb Paredes and I am the Climate Action 
Resident at The Nature Conservancy in Maine l appreciate this opportunity to testify in 
support of LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor 
School for All Maine Students Program. We want to especially thank Senator Brenner and 
Representative Carlow for bringing this bill forward, along with the many cosponsors including 
members of this committee 
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to 
conserving the lands and waters on which all life depends Guided by science, we create 
innovative, on-the-ground solutions to our world's toughest challenges so that nature and 
people can thrive together We use a collaborative approach that engages local communities, 
governments, the private sector, and other partners The Nature Conservancy has been leading 
conservation in Maine for more than 60 years and is the 12th largest landowner in the state, 
owning and managing roughly 300,000 acres We also work across Maine to restore rivers and 
streams, partner with ﬁshermen in the Gulf of Maine to rebuild groundﬁsh populations, and 
develop innovative solutions to address our changing climate. 
LD 1817 establishes the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program to provide immersive 
outdoor education opportunities to students in grade 4 through grade 8 The bill would provide 
annual funding and capacity to establish the program and connect Outdoor School providers 
directly with Maine schools and school districts lmportantly, this effort would focus on equitable 
access, evaluation, and the formation of an Outdoor School for All Advisory Committee. 
As an organization rooted in science and working with Maine communities on climate change 
mitigation and adaptatron, TNC believes that addressing the climate crisis requires a clear 
understanding of the causes of climate change, its impacts on people and the environment in 
Maine and across the globe, and the ways that policymakers, communities, and individuals can 
act to create effective and equitable solutions This starts with education, and LD 1817 would 
create foundational opportunities for Maine students to access hands-on, climate and outdoor 
education experiences Acting on climate change requires looking toward the future, and this bill 
makes a direct investment in the people who will shape that future 
TNC urges the committee to support LD 1817 Thank you for the opportunity to comment andl 
am available to answer questions at any time
