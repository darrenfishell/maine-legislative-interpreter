FROM Nicholas Fisichelli, PhD Schoodic lnstitute at Acadia National Park 
RE LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing the Outdoor 
School for All Maine Students Program 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Plueker, and distinguished members of the Joint Committee 
on Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry My name is Nicholas Fisichelli As President and 
CEO with Schoodic Institute at Acadia National Park, a nonproﬁt science and education 
organization, I am submitting testimony in support of LD 1817 
This legislation is about equity and access For the past 15+ years, it has been the lucky few 
kids who have had an outdoor school experience in Maine Only those families and schools with 
the means and an existing partnership with an outdoor school have been able to provide this 
immersive education The network of outdoor schools in Maine today reaches thousands of kids 
every year, but this amounts to less than a quarter of the students in a single grade Thus, most 
students are left inside, disconnected from the learning that can happen beyond the walls ofa 
classroom, disconnected from their outdoor heritage, and disconnected from career pathways in 
forestry, farming, fishing and other outdoor industries This disconnect IS especially true for 
children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, kids who are not shown the path 
forward towards meaningful outdoor careers within their own communities We can do better 
LD 1817 IS needed to ensure that every student has an outdoor school opportunity during one 
grade of their school years Fully funded, this legislation would annually support the equivalent 
of an entire grade of students in Maine, roughly 14,000, attending a three-day, two-night outdoor 
education program Over the long term, every student would have an opportunity during one 
year between 4"‘ and 8"‘ grades to attend an outdoor school Participating local school districts 
determine the appropriate grade and partner with an outdoor school of their choosing 
The requested funding, $6 2 million/year, covers the direct student costs for attending an 
outdoor school program and related administrative costs The direct support is $375/student for 
~14,000 students/year to participate in a three-day, two-night program Administrative costs to 
run this program are ~$950,000/year 
As I mentioned, there is a thriving network of outdoor schools in Maine poised to scale up and 
work with all school districts and all Maine students This is a model that outdoor schools have 
been refining for decades The outdoor schools bring private individual, foundation, and 
corporate support to supplement, but not replace, state funding This includes teacher 
development and support, and building relationships with school districts to facilitate outdoor 
school experiences 
Thank you for your continued support of our outdoor heritage and the next generation of outdoor 
leaders
