Testimony from University of Maine Cooperative Extension 
Presented by Ryder Scott, Executive Director of 4-H Camp and Learning Centers 
In Support of LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Education by Establishing 
the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program — May 10, 2020 
Senator lngwerson, Representative Plueker and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry My name is Ryder Scott As Executive 
Director of the University of Maine Cooperative Extens|on ’s 4-H Camps and Learning Centers, I 
am here to speak in support of expanding access to transformational outdoor education and 
experiences for Maine youth, as proposed by LD 1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Education by 
Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program 
For more than a century, UMaine Extension has connected Maine youth to the state's outdoors 
through hands-on learning and leadership development, originally focused on agricultural 
methods and life skills Our efforts prepare young Mainers for future success, building their 
self-awareness and confidence, introducing them to exciting careers and service opportunities in 
important industries like farming, forestry, fisheries, outdoor recreation and tourism, and inspiring 
a respect and commitment to stewardship of our state's precious natural resources 
UMaine Extens|on ’s 4-H Youth Development programs are a cornerstone of this important work, 
serving over 20,000 youth annually through 4-H clubs in every Maine county, and our four 4-H 
camp and learning centers in St George, Woodstock, Princeton and Lincolnville For more than 
40 years, these 4-H Centers have played a critical role providing outdoor and natural resources 
education for Maine's public schools Together with our peer institutions in the Maine Outdoor 
School for All network, we currently provide around 20% of Maine public school students with 
overnight, immersive programming with their classmates at our outdoor school sites 
Evidence demonstrates that outdoor school experiences are beneficial for students ’ academic 
performance, as well as their physical and social-emotional wellness LD 1817 would make 
life-changing opportunities like these available to all Maine students, regardless of the 
socioeconomic status of their family or their school district This week I heard from the 
superintendent of RSU 56 in Dixfield, where each spring the fifth grade comes to Bryant Pond 4-H 
for a multi-day program She told me that without this bonding experience her students would 
struggle with the transition to Dirigo Middle School In the mid-coast, through their experience at 
Tanglewood, science comes alive as fifth graders at Captain Albert Stevens School connect a 
classroom vernal pools unit to field science studying amphibians ‘ adaptations for breathing 
We are humbled that our fellow organizations in the Maine Outdoor School for All Network have 
proposed that we lead and administer this new program, and that so many in the Legislature 
agree with this approach With our expertise, experience and statewide resources and 
relationships, UMaine Extension is uniquely positioned if LD 1817 moves fonivard to partner with 
Maine schools and other outdoor school organizations to develop and further expand high-quality, 
immersive programs with equitable access for all As many of you know, a similar statewide 
outdoor school program was implemented in Oregon following passage by the Legislature there in 
2015-16 and funding through lottery proceeds Oregon State University Extension Service runs 
that initiative
