Department ofAgr1cu1ture, Conservatlon and Forestry I am speakmg today m support of LD 
1817, An Act to Support Outdoor Educatzon by Establzshmg the Outdoor School for All Mame 
Students Program 
Th1s b1ll establlshes a program to prov1de outdoor educatlon to serve Ma1ne students The 
outdoors 1s part of our state’s DNA Many of us were fortunate to obtam outdoor l1teracy through 
our chlldhood experlences — lnkmg, campmg, swlmmmg, hunt1ng, ﬁslnng, and explonng w1th 
our fam1l1es and frlends More broadly spealqng, the goal of the Outdoor School for All ahgns 
well w1th the Department ’s m1ss1on and allows us to 1nst11l the lmportance of our natural 
resource Industnes 1n Mame and to plant seeds for ﬁature generatlons of farmers, foresters, 
ﬁshermen, and others workmg outdoors and/or as stewards of our natural resources 
Unfortunately, many clnldren 1n Mame lack opportumues to en] oy and leam about the outdoors, 
elther because of therr home clrcumstances, lack of access and transportat1on, or the lack of 
sultable school or commumty-based programs LD 1817 takes an 1mportant step to address th1s 
deficlency As outlmed 1n the b111, the Department ’s role would be to adm1n1ster funds and 
convene and manage an ongolng advlsory commrttee Whlle We appreclate the Intent, we request 
that the comrmttee conslder the followlng amendments

should be a pnonty for cons1derat1on If fundlng 1s allocated as proposed 1I1 LD 1817, we 
would recommend that 1t go dlrectly to the Umvers1ty rather than creatlng a new program 
account to be admlmstered by DACF Slmllarly, If funds were to ﬂow dxrectly to the 
Umvers1ty for th1s program, we bel1eve It would be best for the Umvers1ty to also

convene the ongo1ng advlsory commlttee rather than DACF, wlnch vv1ll help streamlme 
the admm1strat1ve respons1b111t1es 
0 Should the leg1slature ultnnately dec1de to asslgn the funds and adnnnlstratlve overslght 
to the Department, we would request a change 1n the report-back date to March 1, 2024, 
for adequate response t1me, as fundmg would not become avallable unt11 90 days after 
adjournment 
In summary, Wl‘11l6 th1s 1s not 1n the G0vernor ’s proposed budget, th1s 1s an exc1t1ng 1rnt1at1ve, 
and the Department would welcome the opportumty to be appropnately engaged I would gladly
