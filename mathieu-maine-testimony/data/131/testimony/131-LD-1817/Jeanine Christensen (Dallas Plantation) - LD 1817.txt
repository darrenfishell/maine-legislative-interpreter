I am in support of establishing an outdoor school for all Maine students program.  I 
am a school outing club advisor and I believe that it is so important to give all 
students opportunities to realize what Maine has to offer in the out of doors.  Making  
it part of school requirements enhances students' opportunities and introduces them to 
lifestyle choices, career opportunities, and mental health support.  Many people have 
become so dependent on their screens and devices and I see this as a way to 
remember how special Maine's environment is.  This is the way to raise future leaders
who will make informed decisions to protect this great resource.
