We moved to Maine from very urban area where we were very concerned for our 
daughters education. Since joining the MESA program at Molly Ockett we have seen 
our daughter blossom and excel in school. She is more engaged, happier and excited 
to go to school. She has always been interested in animals and has said since a young 
age that she wants to be a herpetologist when she grows up. The MESA program has 
really fostered this dream. We are bombarded each day with stories about the latest 
hike, nature that they encountered and things learned from experiments conducted in 
the field. And she is constantly teaching us new things as well. And beyond personal 
enrichment that this program has given our child and our family the greatest gift 
programs like MESA provides is to the earth and society in whole.
In a world where children are becoming less connected to nature at a time when 
nature needs us more, it is very important to have programs like MESA to bring up 
environmental advocates and responsible stewards of the earth.
