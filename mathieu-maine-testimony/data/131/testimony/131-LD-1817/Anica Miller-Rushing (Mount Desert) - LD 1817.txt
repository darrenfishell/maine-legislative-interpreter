Students Program 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representatrve Plueeker, and members of the drstrngurshed Commrttee on 
Agrrculture, Conservatron and Forestry My name rs Dr Anrca Mrller-Rushrng I lrve rn the town 
of Mount Desert and I am submrttrng testrmony rn support of LD I817 
Twenty-ﬁve years ago when I started my career rn educatron I started as an envrronmental 
educator I was deeply affected by those days of watchrng chrldren learn about scrence, nature, 
and ecology, whrle actually surrounded by rt What I saw most profoundly rs that when you 
connect the currrcular lessons to the socral and emotronal lessons mherent and explrcrt rn 
learnrng experrences lrke thrs, the learner then has the rare opportunrty to process that learnrng rn 
a more tangrble and thus lrfe-long way 
But, the questron I ask myself now a lot rs, “How do I know thrs’7 How do I know the rmmersrve, 
overnrght, place-based, and nature-based lessons were rrcher leamrng exper1ences ‘7” 
Today, I have the honor of tryrng to answer questrons lrke those as a Doctor of STEM educatron 
I am now a scrence educatron researcher and the coordmator for the current Marne Outdoor 
Schools for All Provrder Network And although more rs needed, numerous studres from all over 
the world smg the prarses of outdoor learnrng, “we know enough to act” (Dr Howard Frumkrn, 
Dean of the School of Publrc Health at the Unrversrty of Washrngton) I have crted the research I 
wrll be mentronrng rn the testrmony document I have provrded 
Immersrve outdoor educatron helps make the classroom more relevant 
When youth can apply what they learned rn a classroom to real world scenarros they can better 
retam rnformatron and showed academrc garns across socral studres, language arts, math and 
scrence Naturally (grven the connectron to the envrronment) scrence scores saw the brggest lrft 
(by over 26%) (Parrrsh et al , 2005) 
Immersrve outdoor educatron promotes better emotronal health 
Partrcrpatron rn outdoor school was assocrated wrth hrgher ratmgs of conﬂrct resolutron skrlls 
and cooperatron, notrng that 75-93% of chrldren reported that an outdoor settrng calms them 
down when they are angry (Beyer et al , 2015) When thoughts are calm and collected, krds 
better engage, mteract and learn from one another Other socral beneﬁts rnclude rmprovements rn 
self-esteem, leadershrp, motrvatron to learn, cooperatron, conﬂrct resolutron, problem solvmg, 
and peer-to-peer relatronshrp burldrng (Parrrsh, et al, 2005) 
When young people who partrcrpated rn a three-day outdoor adventure program were analyzed 
they found that several areas of self-perceptron proﬁles, such as socral acceptance and behavror 
conduct rncreased rrnmedrately after the program, and that some behavror rmpacts may have 
remarned four months after the trrp Based on the data they thrnk the ﬁndrngs are due to the 
novelty ofthe program experrence and rts duratron (Gar st et al . 2001)
In conclusion, the designers of this bill understand the importance of evaluation and research, 
and have undergirded it as part of the programming that will be made available to youth Because 
how will we know if our educational efforts, provided through this funding, is effective if we 
don’t take the time and effort to consider the metrics we use to measure those learning outcomes 
from the start? This bill provides such evalative measures ‘ 
For these reasons, and more, I would ask you to support LD 1817 and vote to pass this bill 
Thank you to tlm sponsor for bringing forward this bill and thank you to the committee members 
for your work on this Committee

Immersive outdoor education counters nature deficit disorder 
Part of the students ’ resiliency we hope to build through this work is to counter Nature Deﬁcit 
Disorder (Louv, 2005), a phrase coined by Dr Richard Louv in 2005 to serve as a description of 
the human costs of alienation from nature Social and technological changes in the past three 
decades have accelerated the human disconnect from the natural world There 1S an expanding 
body of scientiﬁc evidence that suggests that nature-de ﬁcit disorder contributes to a diminished 
use of the senses, attention difﬁculties, conditions of obesity (Dyment & Bell 2008), and higher 
rates of emotional and physical illnesses Research also suggests that the nature-de ﬁcit weakens 
ecological litera-cy and stewardship of the natural world Louv and many subsequent researchers 
are now focusirg their studies on what is gained through more exposure to natural settings, 
includingnearby nature in urban places (Children and Nature Network, 2023) exposure that is 
provided in the type of programming outlined in this bill 
Immersive outdoor education is important for teachers too 
Evidence shows that engaging students with STEM educational experiences related to 
locally-relevant outdoor heritage provides teachers with critical 215‘ century skill-building skills 
such as communication, problem solving, team work, and critical thinking Skills that are 
valuable tools for their students (NRC, 2011, 2012)
