As a high school teacher I have used outside learning to inspire students.  We have 
gone for heart rate walks, re test walks with reviews in hand.  we have also created 
chalk drawing os circle, parabolas, elipses, and drawn the sieve of Eratosthenes as an 
exercise for remembering important properties and getting exercise, fresh air, 
collaboration, cooperation and social skill work.  With 80 minute periods there is time
for refreshing students air and exciting their brains.  I particularly liked the heart rate 
practice as a ratio and proportion exercise.  The nurse also visited and took the 
students blood pressure.  Over the years the nurse thanked me because she was alerted
to several students with health issues.   This program will empower more teachers to 
take their students outside to see the real application of what they are learning.
