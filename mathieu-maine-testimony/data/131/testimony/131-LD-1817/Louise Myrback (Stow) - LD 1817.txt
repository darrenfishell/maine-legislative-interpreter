We know through research that outdoor educational and experiential programs 
increase skills in motor, cognitive, language, social emotional, and sensorial 
development. I'm here to testify that I've seen my daughter thrive in the MESA 
program. The outdoor experience and hands on learning has given her the chance to 
actually see and touch information she later extend in the classroom. This has made 
her able to retain information in a way that would otherwise be hard to do. It has also 
improved her language skills and created meaningful relationships with her 
classmates and teachers. They have a group dynamic hat is very positive and 
supportive. Outdoor activities and experience creates oneness and a feeling of 
belonging. They are all in it together.
