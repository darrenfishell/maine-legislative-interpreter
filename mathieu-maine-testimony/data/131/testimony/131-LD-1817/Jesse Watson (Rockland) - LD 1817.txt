Statement of Support to LD 1817  An Act to Support Outdoor Education by 
Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program   May 9, 2023
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the distinguished 
Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. My name is Jesse Watson. I 
live in the city of Rockland. I am submitting testimony in support of LD 1817.
It seems clear from both studies and from an intuitive perspective that children benefit
from outdoor education in all kinds of important ways.  It improves mood and mental 
health, but more importantly it connects them to the environment that is in such need 
of protection.  We defend what we know, and it is of crucial importance to facilitate 
the connection between young students and Maine’s outdoor heritage.  
Outdoor education has had a profoundly positive impact on my life.  I grow and hunt 
some of my food and i make some of my medicine from wild plants.  Because of 
these important lessons and skills i’m here to advocate for others to have similar 
experiences as mine.  
For these reasons, I would ask you to support LD 1817 and vote ought to pass on this 
bill. Thank you to the sponsor for bringing forward this bill and thank you to the 
committee members for your work on this Committee.
