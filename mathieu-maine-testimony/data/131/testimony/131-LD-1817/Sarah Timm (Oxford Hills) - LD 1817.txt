Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the distinguished Committee 
on Agriculture, Consen/ation and Forestry My name is Sarah Timm I live and work in the 
Oxford Hills, and I am our school district' s Outdoor Learning Coach I am submitting 
testimony in support of LD 1817 
As a classroom teacher for 20 years, I worked to provide my students with outdoor learning 
opportunities when it was possible and convenient Without support, however, these efforts 
were sporadic and not particularly relevant to grade level standards or student needs I took 
kids outside because it felt like the right thing to do 
From time to time, however, my students and I had the opportunity to visit the Bryant Pond 4H 
Camp, often for an overnight experience These trips were when I felt most alive as a teacher 
and as a student There was the long afternoon I spent enraptured while one of their 
educators taught my class about the history of ﬁremaking Or the hike we once took to the 
top of Mt Christopher in an early April snowfall, examining old cellar holes and newly formed 
vernal pools Or, simply watching my students ’ delighted faces as they sat, family-style, 
around the dinner table together, a rare experience for many of them, and made 
conversation about their busy days, sharing food and stories I knew, during these short trips 
to this very special place, that this was the teaching and learning that meant the most to me 
and, clearly, to my students I knew that these experiences would change their lives, as well 
as mine 
I now have the privilege of being my district ’ s ﬁrst ever Outdoor Learning Coach, due toa 
RREV Award from the Maine DoE which funds my position I am currently immersed in the 
world of outdoor education and work outside with students every day, as well as supporting 
teachers and administrators in the professional development and facilities they need for 
these types of endeavors If not for the inspiration I received from our school visits to camp,I 
would never have dreamed this dream ]Ob I have the honor of working at something whichI 
am more passionate about than anything else helping children get outside Away from 
screens, and seats, and walls, so that they can be calmed by the sounds of the outdoors, and
focused by their natural surroundings Every day, I see ﬁrsthand the beneﬁts of taklng 
ch|ldren outs|de Academ|cally, Tl'16ll' work |s r|cher and more meanlngful Socnally, they are In 
a far better place JUST by |eav|ng the conﬁnes of the|r classrooms Behavnorally, they can 
cope more easlly, snmply because they' re |n a safe, calmlng, natural space 
I have read, |n my research, that taklng students outslde |s as eltectlve as ADHD med|cat|on 
All ch|ldren desen/e the best we can g|ve them The world has glven them screens, both at 
home and now, more and more frequently, at school, and It has glven them a pandemlc to 
struggle through dur|ng the|r format|ve years, requlrmg |solat|on and yet more screen tame 
In order to negate the d|ft1cultythat ’ s been nnﬂlcted upon them, we must strnve to provide for 
all ch|ldren the ant|dote to the modern world, and the mental and so<:|al problems that seem, 
at t|mes, |nescapab|e Th|s antndote |s tlme outslde, to work and play and connect Tlme to 
be themselves
