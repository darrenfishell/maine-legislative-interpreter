Establishing the Outdoor School for All Maine Students Program 
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry committee, my name is Jeff Romano. I appreciate this opportunity to provide 
testimony on behalf of Maine Coast Heritage Trust in support of LD 1817. 
 
Maine Coast Heritage Trust conserves and stewards Maine's coastal lands and islands for their 
renowned scenic beauty, ecological value, outdoor recreational opportunities, and contribution 
to community well-being. We provide statewide conservation leadership through our work with 
land trusts, coastal communities, and other partners. Over the past five decades, we have 
conserved more than 185,000 acres in Maine. 
 
All students deserve outdoor school programming to develop critical thinking skills, improve 
academic performance, school attendance, and post-graduate success. However, currently less 
than a quarter of Maine students have access to outdoor school programming, with rural and 
lower-income districts facing additional challenges to these valuable educational experiences.  
 
LD 1817 has a simple goal of providing immersive outdoor education experiences for every 
publicly funded student in Maine. From what the land trust community has learned through the 
years, this type of investment pays for itself in the long run. Please vote ought to pass on LD 
1817.
