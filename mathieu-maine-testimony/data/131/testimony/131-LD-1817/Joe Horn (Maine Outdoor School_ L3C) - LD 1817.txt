My name is Joe Horn, and I am from Gouldsbor/ o I am a co=founder and Registeredl 
Maine Guide at Maine Outdoor School, L3C, based in Milbridge Please note that Mame 
Outdoor School, founded in 2016, is not afﬁliated with the Maine Outdoor School For 
All that was orgamzed to support this bill' 
II 
This bill is an incredible opportunity for Maine, and I thank those vvho"have worked hard 
to brmg this bill forward Thank you Senator Ingvversen, Representative Plueker, and 
esteemed committee members for the opportunity to speak1
/ 
I am testifying agamst the bill LD l8l7 as presented and would like to see changes made 
to the bill to make it more inclusive to the diversity of outdoor education opportunities 
and needs around the state Speciﬁcally, we’d like to e‘x’pa‘nd thedeﬁnition of “outdoor 
program provider ” mentioned in section 5301, Line 14, as well as address the 
program structure mentioned in section,5303, line 32. 
Outdoor education is critical tqjhe Well-being of all Maine children As a business that 
has been providmg outdoor educational experiences to [youth m Downeast Maine for7 
years, Maine Outdoor School has first-hand knowledge of the impact that outdoor‘ 
experiences have on youth‘ 
.\
» 
I care about this bill because outdoor education 1S vital in providmg real-world, place- 
based experiences aligned with school\ 
CLlI'I‘1CL1l11II1 to fuel deeper learning and‘ 
engagement, build a sense of place to help our students root in this great state, and, as a‘ 
result, stimulate a Maine economy based on one of our state’s greatest assets the 
outdoors‘

The literature broadly deﬁnes outdoor education and enviromnental education as being 
provided by overnight and day programs, formal and non-formal programs, institutions\
\
l 
that are non-proﬁt, for proﬁt, or public entities These run the gamut of educational' 
activities in and around schools led by school faculty or an outside organization, ﬁeld 
trips to nature centers, hiking trails, hatcheries, natural history imuseums, and countless 
others Outdoor education in delivery is necessarily highly diverse, adaptive, and multi- 
faceted—in short, as any rural Mainer knows, it takes a village _' 
Maine Outdoor School is incorporated as an L3 C, or low-proﬁt limited liability 
corporation We founded our business speciﬁcally with the goal of bringing togetherI 
public, private, and governmental ‘ organizations across/the state to provide hands-on, 
standards-aligned outdoor education exactly as our community members, teachers, 
principals, and superintendents need and request Our mtricate and broad Web o'fl 
collaborations brings together land trusts, l'l8.tCl'l6I ‘l6S,' 1’l01'1—pI‘OﬁtS, school districts,

homeschool groups, public libraries, youth groups, and more to provide a diverse suite of 
educational offerings on public and private lands both on and off school campuses truly_ 
for learners of alllages‘ 
I '’ 
However, within the deﬁnition of outdoor program provider outlined in this bill, Maine 
Outdoor School would not qualify This narrow focus on 501c3’s ignores the impact 
that mission-focused businesses/ have on Maine’s economy, and the ability of such 
businesses to provide quality outdoor experiences for our youth.1
I
/ 
This is demonstrated by the fact that in 2022 alone we partnered with 15 organizations‘ 
and 16 public schools where our two outdoor educators provided primarily weekly 
outdoor school experiences to over 1,300 youth in Downeast Maine, while directly 
receiving no grant support . We oﬁen see the same students in our community year after, 
year for these regular outdoor school program series, watching them build positive 
comiections with their communities and getting even more excited to come to school, 
especially on outdoor school days .‘‘~ 
In short, considering the small size of our staff and limited funding, Maine Outdoor 
School, L3C has a disproportionately high impact on the outdoor education sector in the 
State of Mame , and this bill, as presented, would not assist those Hancock and 
Washington County schools who rely on the intricate community of outdoor education , 
opportunities that we have knit together4 
_‘ F \ ‘I 
~ \ \ 
\\ 
We also are concerned about the program structure detailed in section 5303, line 32. 
We‘believe'that outdoor education should be more inclusive than the exclusive focus, 
of “overnight experiences ” this bill promotes. Research shows that regular, optdoor , 
learning experiences in a child’s home ecosystem —whether that’s their backyard or tl'l81I‘\‘ 
schoolyard —1s what builds a deep and lasting connection to place, builds lasting changes 
in environmental ethics and behavior, improves test scores, and decreases student 
absenteeism I‘ ~

’A single 3-4-night outdoor learning opportunity in a child s entire K-l2\ 
6)§p€1'16l'1C6 is not 
adequate to make a long-term change in students ’ attitudes, knowledge, or behaviors \ 
These experiences, while absolutely important, especially from a social-emotional 
development perspective; must be complemented with regular outdoor learning 
experiences closeto home Failure to do so has actually been shown to have harmful 
effects on students ‘ sense of the enviromiiental and cultural signiﬁcance of their own 
home area, potentially leading to kids growing up and leaving the area

In an article published by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, enviromnental 
psychologist Louise Chawla found that’ frequent contact with nature can reduce 
symptoms of attention-de ﬁcit disorder and increase memory, and 1S also associated with 
lower rates of depression They found that frequent, close-to-home experiences were one 
of the best tools to connect kids to nature , , 
By limiting‘ 
outdoor experiences to overnight opportunities, this bill would limit the 
power and impact ofoutdoor education. Outdoor education becomes an isolated 
adventure rather than an integrated part of their educational experience, one that connects 
them to their local ecosystems'

After, one of our 10-week program series 0f_]1lS'[ an hour a week in the schoolyard, a\ 
Hancock County Kmdergarten teacher told us “As kindergarteners, being outdoors 1S 
now permanently in their memory as a positive experience, I know they want to be, 
outdoors more m their yards at\home and out and about in their community because of 
thisopportunity they have had I will continue this weekly outdoor time on my’ own 
knowing how much the kiddos look forwardto it each week” 
By l11'l’11't11’lgi'El’16 deﬁnition of outdoor education program provider to 50lc3 ’s with1 
overnight facilities, this bill 1S limiting the overall impact that the Outdoor, ‘School for All* 
Mame Students program will have The broad goals of this bill would be better achieved 
with a more inclusive deﬁnition of outdoor education program provider to include the full 
scope of enviromnental education programs (not _]l1Sll 501-c3 s, and not _]U.S'[ ones with 
overnight facilities Wl'l1Ch— (l1SpI'Op01 ‘t10I1a'£6ly beneﬁt the more populated, afﬂuent 
communities in southern Maine and along the coast where most of these ‘facilities ex/ist) 
We believe that the funds from a bill like this should be made available to schools to use 
for outdoor education opportunities as ﬁts their school’s needs, location, and community 
interests best— be that day or overnight programs, ﬁeld trips, teacher professional 
development, or the funding of an outdoor classroom on the school campus, to namea 
few possibilities Thank you'
