 Testimony of Repr esentative Mor gan Rielly on  
 LD 574, “An Act to Amend the Laws Governing W orking W aterfr ont Covenants”  
 Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Committee on Agricultur e, Conservation, and For estry  
 Good   afternoon   Senator   Ingwersen,   Representative   Pluecker   and  distinguished   members   of  the 
 Joint   Standing   Committee   on  Agriculture,   Conservation,   and  Forestry .  My  name   is  Morgan 
 Rielly ,  and  I  represent   House   District   127,  which   includes   part  of  Westbrook.   I  am  here  today   to 
 present   LD 574, An Act to Amend the Laws Governing   Working W aterfr ont Covenants   . 
 Our  working   waterfront   is  in  dire  straits.   We  are  down   to  20  miles,   out  of  our  state’ s  5,000   miles  
 of  coastline,   of  working   waterfront.   And,   we  are  losing   these   last  miles   at  an  accelerated   rate. 
 Increasing   demand   for  coastal   properties   coupled   with  rising   property   values   has  endangered  
 working   waterfronts.   When   a  piece   of  working   waterfront   property   has  been   bought   and 
 developed for another use, it is near impossible to recover it.  
 We  can’t  lose  our  working   waterfront   to  wealthy   individuals   and  large  corporate   developers.   It’s 
 the  economic   backbone   of  our  coastal   communities   and  an  important   part  of  our  state’ s  identity . 
 Maine’ s  lobstermen   in  Penobscot   Bay,  clam   harvesters   on  mudflats   in  Lubec,   and  lines   of  cages  
 tended to by oyster farmers in Harpswell are under threat.  
 Under   the  current   working   waterfront   covenant,   the  primary   way  to  preserve   the  working  
 waterfront   is  through   the  Working   Waterfront   Access   Protection   Program,   or  WWAPP,  which   is 
 funded   through   the  Land   for  Maine’ s  Future   in  partnership   with  the  Department   of  Marine  
 Resources.  
 Over   the  past  15  years,   WWAPP  has  helped   preserve   34  properties   as  working   waterfront.   While  
 this  is  an  important   step  forward,   there   are  three   key  issues   with  the  WWAPP.  1)  The  program   is 
 constrained   by  the  availability   of  public   funding.   2)  Current   application-to-award   timelines   make  
 it  difficult   for  WWAPP  to  respond   quickly   in  today’ s  fast-paced   real  estate   market.   3)  Current

 language   in  the  working   waterfront   covenant   statute   contains   very  narrow   language   for 
 organizations' mission statements to make them eligible which has made land trusts ineligible.  
 LD  574  expands   the  language   of  the  working   waterfront   covenant   to  include   land  trusts   as 
 eligible   to  have   the  option   of  working   waterfront   covenants.   This  will  allow   for  private   sector  
 partners   to  work   together   quickly   and  efficiently ,  especially   when   it  comes   to  emer gency   sale 
 situations,   to  mobilize   the  funds   to  protect   working   waterfront.   And,   local   landowners   in  coastal  
 communities   might   also  prefer   selling   their  property   to  local   land  trusts   that  are  focused   on 
 preserving the waterfront than a state agency . 
 Thank   you  very  much   for  your  time  and  consideration.   I  would   be  happy   to  answer   any  questions  
 or provide you with any information for your upcoming work session.
