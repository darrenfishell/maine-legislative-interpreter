Testimony on LD 574: An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Working Waterfront Covenants
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the committee on Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry, my name is Jeff Romano. I appreciate this opportunity to provide 
testimony on behalf of Maine Coast Heritage Trust in support of LD 574.
Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) conserves and stewards Maine's coastal lands and islands 
for their renowned scenic beauty, ecological value, outdoor recreational opportunities, and 
contribution to community well-being. We provide statewide conservation leadership through 
our work with land trusts, coastal communities, and other partners. Over the past four decades, 
we have conserved more than 150,000 acres in Maine.
In 2005, working waterfront protection became a focus for the Land for Maine’s Future 
Program. Shortly after, the Maine Legislature enacted a bill that established a working 
waterfront covenant as a vehicle to protect these properties in perpetuity, much like the role 
conservation easements play on working forests, productive farmlands, wildlife habitats, and 
outdoor recreational open spaces. In the nearly two decades that have followed, significant 
progress has been made in the permanent protection of working waterfront sites from York to 
Lubec. However, there is a lot more that can be done. Successful protection of more of these 
properties will help support the long-term stability of Maine’s commercial fishing and 
aquaculture industries.
LD 574 is a small, but beneficial amendment to the law. If enacted, the change would make it 
more possible for land trusts like MCHT to hold working waterfront covenants. While this 
added provision is likely to be used infrequently, there might be situations when a working 
waterfront project’s supporters identify a land trust as the best holder of the covenant. This 
change would make that more possible.
