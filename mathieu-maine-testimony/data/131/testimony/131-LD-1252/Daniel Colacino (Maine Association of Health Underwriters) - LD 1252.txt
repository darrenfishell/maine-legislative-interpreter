RE:  LD #   1252 
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
On behalf of the Maine Association of Health Underwriters (MaineAHU), I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to submit comments on the proposed bill. 
 MaineAHU is a state chapter of the National Association of Health Underwriters and represents licensed 
agents, brokers, and employee benefit consultants who sell and service individual and group health, 
disability, Medicare, and long-term care insurance. 
We are writing in support of LD 1252. 
The concept of having a limited number of plans for clarity and minimizing plan selection is certainly 
something we endorse.  However, we feel that the implementation of the metal level plans 
accomplishes much of this for the group market. We support standardized plans for the individual 
market and think this should continue.  

The dynamics of plan selection differs in these two markets.  In the individual market, members select a 
plan by themselves or with the help of an assistor while in the small group market, it is usually the 
employer who chooses the plan for the employees so that the employees are offered the plan that has 
been chosen.  In most cases the employer is assisted by a broker or agent who is versed in and can 
explain the available plans.  The need for standardized plans is not as necessary but what is necessary is 
flexibility of options to meet the employerâ€™s business needs. That flexibility is limited by the Clear Choice 
plan designs and is why we support the elimination of the requirement that Clear Choice be offered to 
small group employers.  
We would like to thank the Committee for considering our comments and the opportunity to express 
our views. If you have questions, please feel free to contact me. 
 
Respectfully,
