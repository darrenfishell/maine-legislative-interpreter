In opposition to L.D. 1252 
An Act to Ensure Choices in Health Insurance Markets by Limiting the 
Requirement to Offer Clear Choice Design Health Plans 
Presented by Representative Joshua Morris 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance & Financial Services 
April 20, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee, I am 
Acting Superintendent of Insurance Tim Schott. I am here today to testify in 
opposition to L.D. 1252. 
The bill would amend the Pooled Market and Clear Choice Design Chapter‘ 
of the Insurance Code by limiting the Clear Choice design requirements to 
individual health plans in the federally facilitated marketplace or the Maine Health 
Insurance Marketplace and eliminating the requirement to offer Clear Choice plans

to small employer groups. The bill would also repeal the 3-plan cap on alternative 
plans that each carrier may offer under the Clear Choice law.2 
The bill would undo elements of the Made for Maine Act enacted in 20193 
and the clarifying legislation enacted in 20214 , that have only recently been put 
into place. Made for Maine is a signiﬁcant step toward greater consumer 
protection in health coverage. One purpose of the Made for Maine legislation is to 
simplify purchasing health insurance for consumers by limiting the number of plan 
options and giving consumers the ability to compare out-of-pocket costs for 
commonly used health care services. Another purpose is to strengthen the 
individual and small group health insurance markets by combining them into one 
larger market and extending reinsurance to small groups. We encourage the 
Committee to maintain these reforms as a way of maintaining market stability. 
The bill raises signiﬁcant concerns for the Bureau because of the current 
Section 1332 waiver for the merged market approved effective January 1, 2023 
through December 31, 2027. This waiver provides the funds to reinsure the small 
group market together with the individual market. Any proposed changes to the 
market need to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) and approved by CMS before the change could become effective. It would 
be highly disruptive to change a market restructuring that has only been in effect 
for just over three months. 
Thank you. I would be glad to answer any questions now or at the work 
session.
