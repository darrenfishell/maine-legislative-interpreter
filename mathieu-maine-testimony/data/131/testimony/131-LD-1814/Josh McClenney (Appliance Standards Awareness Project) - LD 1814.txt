RE: In Support of LD 1814 – An Act to Reduce Mercury in the Environment by Phasing Out Certain 
Fluorescent Light Bulbs  
 
Dear Members of the Joint Environment and Natural Resources Committee:  
 
Please accept this testimony on behalf of the Appliance Standard s Awareness Project (ASAP). We are a 
project of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) dedicated to advancing cost -
effective appliance and lighting standards at both the national and state level. We write in support of LD 
1814.  
 
In 20 22, ASAP and ACEEE published a joint report - Farewell to Fluorescents: How a Phaseout Can Cut 
Mercury Pollution, Protect the Climate, and Save Money – detailing research findings that Light Emitting 
Diodes (LEDs) are ready to widely replace fluorescent li ght bulbs. 1 We also published analysis showing 
savings states could see from transitioning common fluorescent light bulbs to LEDs, which can be found 
online and at the end of these comments.2 We would be happy to provide additional information about 
this analysis or answer any questions.  
 
LD 1814 WOULD SAVE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES MONEY, HAVE VERY FAST PAYBACKS  
LD 1814 would transition off the sales of common fluorescent light bulbs, allowing LEDs to take their 
place. Because LEDs are twice as energy ef ficient as fluorescents, they generate significant electricity bill 
savings. ASAP estimates by 2030 Maine would see $20 million in annual, statewide electricity bill savings 
due to transitioning from fluorescents to LEDs.3 By 2050 this would result in cum ulative savings of $253 
million statewide on electricity bills.  
 
Additionally, the majority of fluorescent light bulb sales today are for commercial buildings. ASAP 
estimates for the most common fluorescent light bulb type, the 4 -foot T8, the commercial se ctor would 
see a payback period of less than one month. Each 4 -foot T8 LED would then go on to save $30 per bulb 
over its lifetime, resulting in significant electricity bill savings.  
 
LD 1814 WOULD AVOID TOXIC MERCURY POLLUTION, SAVE ENERGY, AND AVOID GREE NHOUSE GASES  
All fluorescent light bulbs contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin that threatens human health and the 
environment. When fluorescent bulbs are accidentally broken —whether in homes, businesses, or the 
waste management system —they present a health  hazard to those nearby. LEDs do not contain 
mercury, therefore transitioning away from fluorescents would avoid a source of mercury pollution 
coming into Maine. ASAP estimates by 2050 Maine would cumulatively avoid 45 pounds of mercury 
waste, enough to co ntaminate 2.2 billion gallons of water.

Furthermore, LEDs increased energy efficiency means the state would see reduced energy consumption 
and thereby also avoid greenhouse gas emissions. ASAP estimates in 2030 Maine would see annual 
savings of 162 gigawa tt hours of electricity, equivalent to the electricity consumption of around 18,800 
households. From this, by 2050 Maine could cumulatively avoid the release of 178,000 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of about 39,600 gasoline -powered  passenger vehicles driven for 
one year.  
 
LEDs ARE READY TO REPLACE COMMON 
FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULBS  
LEDs have advanced tremendously over the last 10 
years. Our lighting market research found that today 
LEDs are widely available and cost effective as 
repla cements for general -purpose, white light 
fluorescent light bulbs across the different sizes and 
shapes. General -purpose, white light bulbs are most 
commonly found in office building settings or in certain 
residential situations like a kitchen or basement ( see 
Figure 1). LEDs were found to produce the same or 
better light quality, last 2 -3 times longer, have positive 
economic outcomes for consumers, and not contain 
mercury compared to their general -purpose 
fluorescent counterpart. LD 1814 only proposes to tr ansition out these types of fluorescents and would 
not cover specialty fluorescents, such as ultraviolet (UV) fluorescents used for suntanning booths or 
other specialty purposes.  
 
LD 1814 IS A COST -EFFECTIVE WAY TO ACHIEVE STATE GOALS  
Transitioning away from fluorescent light bulbs to LEDs is a low -cost way for Maine to cut energy waste, 
reduce electricity bills, and reduce g reenhouse gases – helping the state meet its clean energy, energy 
efficiency, and affordability goals.  
 
We would be happy to provide further information, answer questions, or provide technical assistance.
