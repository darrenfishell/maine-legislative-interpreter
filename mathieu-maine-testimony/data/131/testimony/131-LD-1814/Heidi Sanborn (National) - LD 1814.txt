LD 1814
I am Heidi Sanborn, the Founding Executive Director of the National Stewardship 
Action Council here in strong support of LD 1814 by Rep. Bell.  We passed AB 2208 
in CA last year that essentially is the same bill.  We are delighted that CA and Maine 
continue to lead the nation in preventing toxics from entering our states going back to 
EPR for mercury thermostats in 2008.  In fact, I sponsored a delegation of CA state 
legislators that visited Maine July of 2022 to learn about all that you are doing in 
Maine and develop even closer relationships between our state legislators as our states
both can lead the nation on mercury lighting sales phase out and much more.  We had 
no opposition to this bill in CA and worked through any issues with stakeholders and 
hope you have the same broad support we did to pass this important bill to eliminate 
toxic mercury from lighting  and increase energy efficiency saving businesses and 
residents money.
