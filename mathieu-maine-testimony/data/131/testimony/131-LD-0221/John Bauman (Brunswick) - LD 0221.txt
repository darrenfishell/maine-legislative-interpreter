LD 221
As residents of the Merepoint peninsula with our home facing Merepoint Bay, we 
frequently are disturbed with excessive noise produced by at least 4 airboats that 
sometimes pass our house at 4:30 AM en route to the flats.  There must be some way 
to reduce this excessive noise that disturbs us at least twice, sometimes four times a 
day, as well as the wildlife that  call Mere Point Bay their home.
We are in favor of LD 221, but more importantly we request a noise reduction method
whether it be mufflers or some other way to reduce this noise.  We are tired of hearing
this excessive noise and wildlife being disturbed day after day.
Thank you very much.
