We understand the apparent need for some people to use airboats for their livelihood. 
However, we live in one of those “localized noise sensitive areas that deserve special 
protection from very early operations” of airboats. We live in a narrow part of the 
Harraseeket River.This means that airboats are very close to the shore and our houses.
Last summer there were not one, but two airboats right outside our houses, often 
before 5:00 am. Being awakened day after day after day takes a health toll on us.In 
our neighborhood we have elders, infants, and severely ill people. This is a health 
issue, not a mere annoyance. Thank you for taking our plight into consideration.
