LD 221
While I support LD 221, the bill does not do enough to protect both people and 
animals (namely water fowl) in the coastal environment from the negative health 
impacts of airboat noise.  The proposed decibel levels are far too high.  The costs are 
too great to the community for airboat use to continue.
