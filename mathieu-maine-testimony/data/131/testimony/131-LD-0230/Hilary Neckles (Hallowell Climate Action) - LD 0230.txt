FROM:  Hilary Neckles, Chair, Hallowell Climate Action  
 
SUBJECT:  LD 230  – Resolve, to Require the Maine National Guard to Sell Certain Property 
in Hallowell  
 
Dear Honorable Committee Members:  
 
Hallowell C limate Action, a project of the Hallowell Conservation Commission, supports 
passage of LD 230.  
 
This Resolve will require property owned by the Maine National Guard to be sold to the City of 
Hallow ell for no more than $1, effectively transferring the property to the City. This property is 
forested and is contiguous on two sides with Hallowell’s City Forest  within the Hallowell  
Reservoir  Recreation Area . Several of the Recreation Area’s multi -use tra ils cross the property, 
but the only potential access for vehicles is via a historic Right of Way (ROW) that traverses 
waterways and low-lying  areas.    
 
The Maine National Guard does not currently manage this property in any way . Given the 
location of the  property and the environmental sensitivity of the ROW, it is hard to envision any 
potential use of the property other than its current use as a forested parcel with recreational 
benefits. Maine has identified forests as a key part of the state’s response to climate change, and 
the Governor’s Forest Carbon Task Force has recommended actions that even small woodland 
owners can take to increase carbon storage. Achieving Maine’s goals of carbon neutrality by 
2045 requires actions to reduce net emissions across  the entire state.  Transfer of the Maine 
National Guard property to the City of Hallowell will permit the City to incorporate the lot into 
the City’s Forest  Management Plan and include this forested property in municipal climate 
actions that contribute to the State’s carbon reduction goals.
