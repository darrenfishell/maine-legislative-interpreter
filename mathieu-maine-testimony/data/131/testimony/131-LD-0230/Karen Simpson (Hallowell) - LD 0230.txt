LD 230
I am writing in support of LD 230, to require the transfer of National Guard property 
within the City Forest, known as the RES, to the city of Hallowell for $1.00 by June 
30, 2024.
I am a strong supporter of the bill because I value the RES, and want to see the entire 
property returned to the city and to be well managed according to an overall 
comprehensive plan. I believe the city of Hallowell has the resources to achieve this. 
I speak as a 38 year resident of Hallowell who has spent countless hours walking the 
trails and exploring every part of the RES.  I have many personal connections. As a 
volunteer I have participated in trail maintenance, Earth Day clean up, bittersweet 
clipping with Halldale students and many bird walks.  The RES is full of many 
natural wonders.  The Porcupine Ridge trail was named when I introduced the HCCâ€™s 
National Park consultant to the porcupine dens off trail in a granite waste heap.
In short I believe that the transfer has been delayed for too long and the time for 
action has come.  Thank you Representative Dan Shagoury (Hallowell) for 
sponsoring the bill and  to co-sponsors: Senator Craig Hickman (Winthrop), 
Representative Malon (Biddeford) and Representative Montell (Gardiner).
