LD 230
Dear  Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Members  of the Veterans and Legal 
Affairs Committee, 
I write in support of LD 230, directing the Me National Guard to facilitate the transfer of 
ownership of lot (#019-023) in the Hallowell Recreation Area to the City of  Hallowell. This 
7-acre property is located within Hallowell’s well- used and well-loved “Res.”  
Every day people from Hallowell, Augusta, Manchester and surrounding towns visit the Res 
to enjoy its trail system. The trails connect with those in Manchester to make a larger and 
very enjoyable outdoor adventure. People hike, walk their dogs, observe wildlife, watch 
wildflowers emerge, ski, showshoe, swim, ride bikes, and otherwise enjoy this beautiful place.
It is a local gem that open to the public in all seasons. 
The trails are created and maintained by volunteers under the direction of the Hallowell 
Conservation Commission. Obtaining title to the Maine National Guard lot will facilitateaccess 
to  and maintenance of these trails. 
Thank you for helping in this effort to acquire ownership of a small but important part of a 
place that offers well-used. year round, outdoor recreational opportunities.
