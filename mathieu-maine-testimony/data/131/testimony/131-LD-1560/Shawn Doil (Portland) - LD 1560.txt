I do NOT support this so-called Stand your ground law. This, as we have seen in 
other parts of the country, does not deter criminal activity and violence, but rather 
increases it. There is no reason that we should embolden individuals to shoot first and 
ask questions later. It is dangerous and serves no public purpose.
