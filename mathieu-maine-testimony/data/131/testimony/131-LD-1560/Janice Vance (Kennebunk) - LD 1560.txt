Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1560
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is Janice Vance and I live in 
Kennebunk. I am a member of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, which raises 
awareness about the effects of gun violence.  I would like to go on record as being 
opposed to LD 1560, the stand-your-ground bill. The recent national news stories 
about gun owners who didn’t think twice about shooting innocent people who 
knocked on their door, turned around in their driveway, accidentally got into the 
wrong car in a parking lot, or tried to make a food delivery are just a few examples of 
why foolishly encouraging anyone to “shoot first and ask questions later” is a huge 
mistake. This is yet another “solution in search of a problem.”  Maine is one of the 
safest states in the country, and enacting this law would make it less safe. Every state 
that’s passed a stand-your-ground law has seen an increase in the number of 
homicides, where shooters unilaterally – and impulsively - decide to act as police, 
judge and jury. Where is the “due process” for the victim? Where is “innocent until 
proven guilty” for the victim? Please keep in mind that only 31 per cent of Americans
own guns; why are we constantly being asked by people such as the author of this bill 
to give this small minority of people more opportunities to use lethal force on the rest 
of us, without accountability? Thank you, and please do not consider this bill further.
