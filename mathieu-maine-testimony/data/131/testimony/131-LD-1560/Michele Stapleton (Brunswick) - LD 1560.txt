Testimony in Opposition to LD 1560 An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual 
Exercising Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing Certain Acts upon 
Demand [i e a "Stand your Ground" or "Shoot First Law”] 
Good morning, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep Salisbury and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee My name is Michele Stapleton and I live in 
Brunswick I come to the issue of gun safety after a career in _|OUI'l'1aIlSI ’Tl, including 
time at the Bangor Daily News In my newspaper work I was always particular good at 
monitoring the police scanner, which means I have been to the scene of many 
shootings, often arriving jLIS’E as police were pulling up I have seen way more than my 
share of weeping relatives, EMTs desperately trying to save lives and bodies under 
white sheets 
I learned very quickly that what decades ago would have been Just two guys beating 
the crap out of each other, has turned deadly with the proliferation of guns and how 
easily someone can pull out a gun when tempers flare 
Do not be confused Self-defense laws already allow you to use deadly force outside 
of the home to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm However, existing law 
recognizes that life is sacred and taking the life of another is not justified if you can 
avoid it by simply walking away (The Castle doctrine relieves you of the duty to step 
away when you are inside of your home) 
This proposed SYG law minimizes the value ofa human life and would let you l<Ill 
another even when you could de-escalate by simply walking away 
In the 20+ years that the Congress refused to fund gun research by the CDC, others 
stepped in to fill the void One of these was renown researcher David Hemenway at 
Han/ard You may hear the gun lobby say guns are used millions of times a year in self- 
defense, Hemenway basically peer-reviewed their research and found their figures to 
be "extreme overestimation " 
He also found that what a person often reports as self- 
defense IS actually a confrontation that they in fact started Think George Zimmerman 
chasing down Trayvon Martin, arguing with Martin and when Martin finally reacts, 
Zimmerman becomes scared for his life and kills Martin in "seIf defense" 
SYG laws encourage jUS’E this kind of vigilantism SYG laws encourage people to take 
the law into their own hands without calling police, who are trained at intervening in 
dangerous situations (The police dispatcher told Zimmerman to go back to his truck 
and wait) They discourage de-escalation by not requiring the shooter to remove 
himself It's a shoot-first-ask-questions-later culture that gives a green light to the man 
on the street with possibly no firearms training, no de-escalation training, and most 
likely no bias training to be Judge, Jury and executioner, all in a matter of seconds
Maine doesn't want gun owners like George Zimmerman, Kyle Rittenhouse and the 
three men who killed Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, GA, walking around thinking it's 
’El'1e|l‘jOlf) to do police work 
You (the committee) have the benefit of seeing how Stand Your Ground laws have led 
to a rise in guns deaths in other states, with unarmed victims being brought down by 
assailants who could have easily walked away Please don't bring that to Maine 
Note I've linked to the articles that address racial disparities in use of the SYG laws,a 
Washington Post Article and a study from Duke Basically, they show how Whites 
shooting Blacks are much more likely to get off claiming self-defense than a Black who 
claims self defense for shooting a White
