LD 1560
Dear distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee:
My name is Kathleen Gibbons, and I am a resident of Old Orchard Beach. The 
principle of the Golden Rule is to treat others as one wants to be treated. In my view, 
this principle, or duty, is relevant when considering LD 1560, which I OPPOSE. 
Rather than supporting the duty to treat others as one wants to be treated, "stand your 
ground" laws create a dangerous “shoot first” culture of violence and vigilantism. 
They have repeatedly allowed people to shoot and kill others even when the shooter 
could have easily and safely walked away. 
Evidence does not support the claim that "stand your ground" laws deter criminal 
activity and violence. In fact, several studies examining homicide and violent crime 
rates consistently show that the passage of stand your ground laws increase homicides
and gun injuries.
I urge you to OPPOSE LD 1560.
