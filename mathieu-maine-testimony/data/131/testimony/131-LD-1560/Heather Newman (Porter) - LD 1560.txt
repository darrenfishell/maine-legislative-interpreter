LD 1560
I am writing in opposition to LD 1560. Maine already protects citizens who are 
defending themselves in or out of their homes, the only legal requirement is that they 
try to find a way to retreat from the situation before using potentially deadly force. 
Why is attempting to avoid killing or grievously injuring a person a problem? Studies 
have shown stand your ground laws increase, not decrease homicides and gun 
violence. It also impacts marginalized communities as people are perceived as a threat
when they are not. BIPOC, disabled, and mentally ill people will be at higher risk of 
injury or death if people are not required to seek a way to remove themselves from a 
situation before using their firearm. I am not against gun ownership nor am I against 
reasonably defending oneself or home. However, this proposed amendment is not 
reasonable.
Thank you for your time.
