Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Jeanie Barnard and I live in Yarmouth.  I oppose this bill because it takes 
Maine in the wrong direction. I don't want it to be easier for citizens to kill people out 
of a perceived sense of threat. There is no data to support the claim that "stand your 
ground" laws deter criminal behavior and violence. So far data shows that states that 
have these laws have an increase in homicides and gun injuries. We need to make 
Maine safer not more violent and dangerous. Thank you.
