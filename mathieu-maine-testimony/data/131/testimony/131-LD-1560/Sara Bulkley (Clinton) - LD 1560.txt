LD 1560
I am writing today in support of LD 1560. My personal belief is that the individual 
who is being threatened, robbed or forced to cooperate in an activity against their will 
should be able to defend themselves by whatever means necessary from an aggressor 
without fear of criminal charges being levied against them. When in fear for their 
safety or life, it is a natural law that an individual must be able to protect themselves 
or a dependent. The responsibility and consequences should rightly fall on the 
aggressor, not the victim. Please vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1560. Thank you for 
your service to the people of Maine.
