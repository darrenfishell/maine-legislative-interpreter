Senator Beebe-Center, Representat1ve Sal1sbury, and members of the Comnnttee on 
Cr1m1nal Just1ce and Publ1c Safety, my name 1s Stella Crawford I’m 18 years old, and I’ma 
sen1or at Cape El1zabeth h1gh school I stand to oppose LD 1560 The Stand Your Ground b1ll 
There are ‘x’ many emergency ex1ts 1n th1s room, and ‘x’ on th1s ﬂoor Th1s 1s my ﬁrst 
t1me be1ng 1ns1de the capltol bu1ld1ng That’s not somethrng many people notlce, or even thmk 
about when they enter a room, but grow1ng up I’ve been tramed to constantly be scann1ng for an 
exlt because th1s 1s the country we have created and l1ve 1n I bel1eve that there 1s an opportumty 
to make th1s country safer, there 1s an opportun1ty for pos1t1ve change Some m1ght say I’ve 
grown up 1n the d1g1tal age, however, I bel1eve I’ve grown up 1n the mass shoot1ng age You’ve 
ralsed an ent1re generat1on scared to go to school because today m1ght be the day a gunman 
enters our bu1ldmg, we are add1t1onally scared to go to the mall, mov1e theater, or even knock on 
the wrong door I see a need for change 
As a student, I th1r1kI have a fa1rly 1mportant perspect1ve I have been 1n publ1c school 1n 
Ma1ne for 12 years, and 1n those 12 years, I camaot remember a t1me when there wasn’t 
d1scuss1on, or planmng for what we would do 1n case of an lntruder carrylng a ﬁrearm Just 
pract1c1ng these dr1l1s 1nst1lls anx1ety 1n us at such a young age and that’s the best-case scenano 
Further 1n the 12 years I’ve attended schools 1n Mame gun v1olence and mass shoot1ngs have 
1ncreased every year The problem 1s gettmg worse, not better And 1n the past few months, we 
have even seen gun v1olence and deaths closer than ever 1n South Portland, Bowdom and South 
Berw1ck 
Th1s Stand Your Ground b1ll w1ll not only p1'0V1C1C safe harbor for cr1m1nals but g1ve 
people the ab1l1ty to use ﬁrearms aga1nst 1nnocent people wrth no pun1shment There 1s no reason 
that we should be pass1ng a b1ll that makes 1t eas1er for people to shoot wrthout th1r1k1ng You 
can’t take the act1on back once you’ve pulled the tr1gger It’s done, and many l1ves are shattered 
when one person 1s lost The only beneﬁt to th1s b1ll passlng 1s money for the NRA a11d gun 
manufacturers 
I often ask myself 1n lnstory class, why are we learn1ng about th1s, 1t happened a couple 
of hundred years ago, and none of th1s 1nfo1mat1on seems all that relevant to the th1ngs We need 
to beg1n leam1ng about rlght now What I have leamed from that questlon 1s 1t’s a preventat1ve 
measure We learn about events occurrmg 1n the past, to help us better understand problems 1n 
the future, and eventually, prevent these sorts of events from happemng aga1n So I must ask, 
why 1s th1s b1ll even be1ng consldered? Every s1ngle state that has passed th1s b1ll al1ow1ng 
people to shoot ﬁrst, has seen a dramat1c 1ncrease 1n gun v1olence, hom1c1de rates, and overall 
v1olence 1n commun1t1es Is that what we want for Mame’? 
Th1s 1s not a red or a blue 1ssue, 1t’s a human 1ssue And allow1ng th1s b1ll to pass w1ll 
only further allow the damages caused by gun v1olence 1n the country to contlnue
