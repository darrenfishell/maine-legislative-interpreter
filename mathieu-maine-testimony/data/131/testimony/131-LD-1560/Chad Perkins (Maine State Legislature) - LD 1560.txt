MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT LD 1561, An Act to Remove the Duty of an Ind1v1dual Exerc1smg Self-defense to Safely 
Retreat or Abstam from Perfomnng Certam Acts upon Demand 
Commlttee Charr Senator Beebe-Center, Comm1ttee Cha1r Representatlve Sahsbury and d1st1ngu1shed 
members of the Jomt Standmg Comnnttee on Cnmmal Justlce and Publ1c Safety, 
Thank you for allowmg me to bnng forth my b1ll, An Act to Remove the Duty of an Indlvldual 
Exerc1smg Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstam from Perfornnng Certam Acts upon Demand 
Twenty-One Feet That 1s a number that every law enforcement ofﬁcer has heard numerous t1mes over 
the course of the1r career It 1s the supposed “safe zone” compnsed of a d1stance that an assa1lant w1tha 
kmfe would have to be that would g1ve a tramed law enforcement ofﬁcer ample t1me to draw and ﬁre 
the1r s1de arm 1n self defense before the attacker could reach and cause mjury to the ofﬁcer w1th the 
kmfe The “2l Foot Rule” , or “Tueller Dnll” , was developed m 1980 by a pol1ce sergeant who rana 
senes of tests and, whlle not part of any ofﬁc1al pohcy, has been used as a standard and even used 1n 
court tnals The “2l Foot Rule” was developed usmg a senes of dnlls and not sc1ent1ﬁc standards 
though, and has been wrdely cr1t1c1zed Subsequently, Dr Hunter Martamdale, D1rector of Research at 
the Advanced Law Enforcement Rap1d Response Trammg Center, conducted a sclentlﬁc study 1n 2020 
Accordlng to the research, Wh1le certam tact1cal movement techmques taught to tramed ofﬁcers can 
shghtly decrease mjury to ofﬁcers at closer d1stances, the study shows that the average d1stance of 
twenty-one feet was 1nadequate and that a better d1stance was l1kely th1rty-two feet, (though the study 
suggested more studmes should be done to mclude scenanos w1th more stressors) 
The study also showed that of the allowed react1on tlme to cover the twenty-one feet of l 5 seconds, 
75% of that tlme was used by the test subject to make a detennmatlon of elther to shoot or not shoot 
dunng the tests We know that react1ont1mes for the average untralned ‘c1v111an ’ 1s roughly tw1ce that

of a tramed law enforcement ofﬁcer We also know from research that each add1t1onal 
stressor, each d1v1ded attentlon task and each add1t1onal level of complex1ty srgnlﬁcantly 
adds to reactron tlme, both for tramed and untramed people 
So nnagme now that you are put 1n the hornble pos1t1on where your l1fe 1s now 
threatened Imagme that someone w1th a kmfe, or a gun, or a crowbar comes at you and 1s 
gomg to k1ll you, they mean 1t and you know they mean 1t Imag1ne that fear What 1s 
go1ng to happen 1s that you are 1mmed1ately gomg to go mto a ‘ﬁght or ﬂ1ght’ response 
You W111 probably start expenencmg tunnel v1s1on as your ﬁeld of v1ew focuses narrowly 
on the threat You may actually start to hear your own heart pound whlle all of the no1ses 
of the world around you seem to drown out and away as you expenence aud1tory 
bluntmg T1me may actually seem to slow down, or 1t may even seem to speed up These 
perceptual d1sto1t1ons are real, they are hardw1red mto us and are a normal phys1olog1cal 
response to a threat When I teach act1ve shooter response tra1mng or defensrve shooter 
classes, I tell my students th1s 1s called ‘l1zard bram’ 
At th1s pomt the assa1lant, who 1s mtent on causmg your death or mﬂrctlng senous 
bod1ly1nJury, already has the advantage They have already made the dec1s1on to cause 
harm and are 1n the process of takmg actlon to do so You have spl1t seconds to respond 
and much of that tnne 1s already consumed w1th the nghtful dec1s1on makmg processes of 
“1s the use of deadly force authonzed to defend myself’ and “can I do so safely w1thout 
caus1ng 1nJtu'y to mnocent people 1n the area” Each one of those dec1s1ons, wh11e 
obv1ously needmg to be made, s1gn1ﬁcantly slow your react1on t1me You probably do 
not have the beneﬁt of the trammg afforded most law enforcement ofﬁcers, so your 
react1on t1me w1ll be slower You may even have to ﬁnd somethmg to defend yourself 
Wlth, for example another crowbar, and seconds count 
It 1s because of these factors I beheve we have a senous, and potentlally deadly, ﬂawm 
our current law Under the law as 1t 1s wrrtten now a person, who would otherwlse be 
_]ust1ﬁed 1n the use of deadly force to defend themselves, 1s compelled by a Duty to 
Retreat from the s1tuat1on 1f they are able so long as they are not 1n the1r home 
Th1s 1s an 1ssue as each level of complexlty removes l1fe sav1ng t1me from your reactlon 
t1me and d11n1n1shes your ab1l1ty to defend your own l1fe Each dec1s1on to ‘retreat’ 1s not 
a slmple dec1s1on, but rather a complex s1tuat1onal awareness analysls that may conslst of 
“do I have to retreat” , “can I retreat safely” , “1fIt1y and retreat can I st1l1 be lulled wh1le 
retreatmg (1e shot)” , “wh1ch 1s the safest/fastest route to retreat” or even “1s that door 
locked” Someone forced to conslder these dec1s1ons has to we1gh m a multltude of 
factors that mclude the relatlve speed and ﬁtness between the aggressor and the v1ct1m, 
weather, v1s1b1l1ty, obstructlons and obstacles, etc 
It 1s even qulte hkely that there are people that do not defend themselves when they 
would otherwrse be completely _]11S't1 ﬁ6d 1n do1ng so, and 1n no legal Jeopardy, s1mply out 
of fear of prosecutlon for fa1lmg to follow the Duty to Retreat and not bemg able to do so 
adequately and safely

Addltlonally, removmg the Duty to Retreat would mcrease pubhc safety for the c1t1zens 
m the State of Mame On the one hand, 1t would allow reasonable persons who were 
under 1mm1nent and 1mmed1ate threat from the use of deadly force to adequately defend 
themselves On the other hand, 1t would be a boon to the v1ct1ms of domestrc abuse We 
know that many orgamzatlons who have advocated for domestlc abuse v1ct1ms’ nghts 
have advocated for the removal of the Duty to Retreat from state statutes nat1ona1ly due 
to the comphcated, but very real, phenomenon known as “Learned Helplessness ” and 
women are less hkely to be prosecuted m states when they defend themselves agamst 
the1r abusers 1n states wlthout a Duty to Retreat (femm1st groups and domestlc abuse 
advocates strongly supported these changes unt1l 2012, when Duty to Retreat becamea 
hot button rssue, but have resumed then" support for removmg Duty to Retreat pr1mar1ly 
because of several hlgh proﬁle cases mcludmg Alexander Interestmgly, though Manssa 
Alexander was charged, women are less l1kely to be charged 1n states wrthout a Duty to 
Retreat m self defense shootmgs and Ms Alexander has become a strong pubhc advocate 
agamst a Duty to Retreat [G1'uber, 2017]) 
Desprte comments of some who clalm that, w1thout a Duty to Retreat, Mame would 
become a “W1ld W1ld West’ , there 1s no 1nd1cat1on that would be the case (s1m1lar cla1ms 
were made when const1tut1onal carry was passed) Whlle self defense laws 1n the State of 
Flonda have become much publ1c1zed and cr1t1c1zed because of several ‘cause célébres ’ 
and the allegat1ons that cases there are handled drfferently across Junsdrctlons, there are 
already a total of 27 states that do not have any Duty to Retreat (Alabama, Alaska, 
Anzona, Flonda, Georgra, Idaho, Indrana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Lou1s1ana, M1ch1gan, 
M1ss1ss1pp1, M1ssour1, Montana, Nevada, New Hampsh1re, North Carolma, Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvama, South Carolma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West V1rg1n1a, and 
Wyomrng) w1th l1ttle note 
Removal of the Duty to Retreat 1s not new, 1t 1s not rad1cal and 1t 1s not w1thout 
precedent However, the theory and reasons beh1nd 1t are not entrrely s1mpl1st1c elther, 
though necessary they be 
Whlle I have not been able to conﬁrm th1s, I am assunnng the Duty to Retreat was 
added to Mame law wrth a full or partral adopt1on of the Model Penal Code Th1s 
assumpt1on 1s based on the presence of T1tle 17-A §l08-2-C-3(0), wh1ch comports to the 
MPC and requrres that someone who 1s threatened w1th unlawful deadly force be 
compelled to not perfonn an act1on that the person 1s not obhgated to do It m1ght be 
notlced at th1s po1nt that there 1s no language regardmg an obl1gat1on to perform a 
pos1t1ve act1on The drafters of the MPC env1s1oned that there would be no scenar1o m 
whlch someone would be compelled under the threat of unlawful deadly force to do 
somethmg that person wanted to do, rnstead optmg for language that only requrred a 
person refram from tak1ng an act1on when they can safely do so 
The log1c m th1s argument 1s that 1f a person can be compelled to retreat, then the 
person can be compelled to do other thmgs as well, mcludmg refra1mng from tak1ng an 
act1on (th1s mnrors the MPC pr1or1ty of the preservatron of l1fe at all costs over md1v1dual 
l1bert1es)

It 1s entrrely poss1ble then that someone could be demed the use of a self defense 
argtunent because they took an afﬁrmatrve actron that they were ordered not to do by 
someone who 1s threaten1ng them wrth unlawful deadly force 
Conslder the follow1ng example, a person 1s ordered to stay 1n then home, an lsolated 
cabln wrthout commun1cat1ons to the outs1de world, by a vrolent aggressor who threatens 
to krll the person 1f they leave If the person leaves, and k1l1s therr aggressor when 
confronted out of fear, the law as wntten would deny them the ab1l1ty to cla1m self 
defense (tlns 1s one example as to why Duty to Retreat laws are problematlc to domestlc 
vrolence v1ct1ms and advocates) It subord1nates the llberty mterests of the law ab1d1ng 
person to the w1shes of the tmlawful actor And wh1le thls theoret1ca1 example sounds far 
fetched and 1s hlghly unl1kely (and wh11e I hope no prosecutor 1n Mame would pursue 
such a case), 1t 1s cons1stentw1th the law 
Many who vrew self defense theory under a broadly framed context argue that 1f you 
extend the fram1ng, the total1ty of the concept1on of the acts, outcomes and contmgencles 
that led to the self defense s1tuat1on, back far enough there 1s ultrmately some po1nt 1n 
whlch the person could have made some dec1s1on or taken some actron that would have 
caused avo1dance of the s1tuat1on Th1s 1s 1mportant as prosecutors and comts must look 
at these crrcumstances as they relate to the necess1ty requ1rement If the frammg 1s too 
broadly expanded 1t could depnve a person of an otherwlse vrable clarm of self-defense 
Conversely, fact-fmders 1n any self defense case can not defme the frammg too 
narrowly elther, as the actlons of a person that purposely or mtenuonally creates a 
s1tuat1on of confrontatron must be consrdered aga1nst the necess1ty need as well 
However, such fact-ﬁnders must remember to cons1der the Autonomy and Drgmtafy 
Interests of the lawfully act1ng person and be careful not to place the actrons of the 
unlawful aggressor above them 
Autonomy Interests are the nghts of the md1v1dual to the mtegnty and autonomy of 
then own body Integnty Interests extend beyond that to the rrght of the md1v1dual to 
move about freely and engage m fundamental nghts, m a free socrety, so long as they do 
not v10late the nghts of others Whenever the mterests of unlawful aggressors w1ll1ng to 
comm1t v1olence are put above md1v1dual Autonomy or Drgmtary Interests of the lawful 
c1t1zen1y, espec1ally those they cons1der too weak to defend themselves, the bad actors 
control socrety and the lawful person 1s demed any defense to the1r threats of 1n]ury 
The nght to defend yourself from senous bodrly 1n_1ury or death 1s an mherent nght 
Currently, Mame 1s one of only ll states that have a Duty to Retreat, however evenm 
Mame there 1s no Duty to Retreat ﬁom your own home, a pr1nc1ple known as the “Castle 
Doctrme” The Supreme Court of the Umted States recently afﬁrmed the 1nd1v1dualr1ght 
to self defense through the Second Amendment m both the Bruen and Heller cases, 
However T1tle 17-A §108 does not d1st1ngu1sh the use of deadly force wrth a ﬁrearm 
versus other forms of the use of deadly force The Court wrote m Bruen, “Although we 
remarked 1n Heller that the need for armed self-defense 1s perhaps ‘most acute’ 1n the 
home, 1d , at 628, we d1d not suggest that the need was 1ns1gn1ﬁcant elsewhere Many 
Amencans hazard greater danger outs1de the home than 1n 1t” and “confrontat1on can

surely take place outsrde the home ” Remov1ng the Duty To Retreat would extend the 
same bas1c nghts, m panty, to the person 1n or out of the home 
I would l1ke to make note to the comm1ttee at th1s polnt that there 1s precedent for both 
hav1ng, and not havmg, a Duty to Retreat 1n Amencan law However for much of our 
h1story, the tendency was to not have a Duty to Retreat, w1th states and courts more 
heav1ly g1vmg deference to 1nd1v1dualr1ghts Some detractors opposed to remov1ng Duty 
to Retreat W111 often clalm that the Duty to Retreat has always been the Law of the Land 
at that removmg 1t 1s “new and radrcal” , 11np1y1ng that 1t 1s mherently “dangerous ” One 
pomt that 1s made 1s that self defense laws m states w1thout a Duty to Retreat are handled 
mconslstently In reahty, most self defense cases are handled drfferently regardless of the 
presence of a Duty to Retreat pnmanly based on how 1nd1v1dual prosecutors and courts 
apply ﬁammg to the 1nd1v1dual case [Raymond, 2009] 
Whlle the Duty to Retreat was mher1ted from Enghsh Common Law, 1t has not been 
umversally used or apphed m our country throughout our hlstory In a famous appellate 
case from Oklahoma 1n 1912, Judge Roy Hoffman wrote, “Under the old common law, 
no man could defend h1mself unt1l he had retreated, and untrl h1s back was to the wall, 
but th1s 1s not the law m free Amenca Here the wall 1s to every man's back It 1s the wall 
of h1s nghts, and when he 1s at a place where he has a nght to be, and he 1s unlawfully 
assalled, he may stand and defend hnnself, and cases somet1mes arrse 1n whrch he has the 
nght, when unlawfully assa1led, to advance and defend hlI1’lS6lfl.1I1'£ll he ﬁnds h1mself out 
of danger ” [Fowler v State] 
Judge Roy had probably kept up on h1s case law as contemporary cases of the t1me 
afﬁrmed h1s statements In Runyan v State (1877) the court wrote that the ab1l1ty to stand 
and defend one’s self was “founded on the law of nature, and 1s not, nor can 1t be, 
superseded by any law of soc1ety” and 1n Beard v US the Supreme Court wrote 1n “A 
man may repel force by force 1n defense of h1s person, habrtatlon, or property agarnst 
anyone or many who mamfestly mtend and endeavor to comm1t a known felony by 
vlolence or surpnse or elther In such case he 1s not compelled to retreat” 
At another t1me, the Supreme Court we1ghed m on the S\1b_]6Ct m Brown v US (1921) 
wntmg, “1f a man reasonably beheves that he 1s m 1mmed1ate danger of death or g;r1evous 
bod1ly harm ﬁom h1s assa1lant, he may stand h1s ground, and that, 1f he krlls h1m, he has 
not succeeded the bounds of lawful self-defense ” and that the expans1on of the nght not 
to retreat was “conslstent w1th human nature” Judge Ol1ver Wendell Hohnes also 
famously wrote 1n th1s case that the prev1ous rules that requ1red even an 1nnocent man to 
retreat, and wlnch were cemented 1n Engllsh Common Law, were the result of requnmg 
the pardon of grace and “had a tendency to oss1fy 1nto spec1ﬁc rules w1thout much regard 
for reason” , further wr1t1ng “Detached reﬂect1on cannot be demanded m the presence of 
an uphfted kn1fe Therefore, 1n th1s Court at least, 1t 1s not a cond1t1on of 1mmumty that 
one 1n that s1tuat1on should pause to cons1der whether a reasonable man m1ght not th1nk 1t 
poss1ble to ﬂy w1th safety”

Fmally, I would hke to address one detractor that I commonly face when address1ng 
th1s 1SS116, that of rac1al d1spar1ty and the effects of prosecut1on of persons who use deadly 
force 1n a self defense s1tuat1on John Roman, a semor fellow at the Urban Inst1tute ’s 
Justlce Pohcy Center, conducted an oft c1ted study uslng Department of Just1ce numbers 
comparmg such prosecut1ons 1n both states w1th, and wlthout, a Duty to Retreat Roman 
found there were fewer prosecutlons across all rac1al groups 1n states wrthout a Duty to 
Retreat He also found that though there was a measurable dlspanty between racral 
groups, shown as a much hrgher percentage of prosecutlons of black on wh1te shootmgs, 
1t tracked proport1onally w1th the overall hom1c1de rate H1s study also showed that there 
really was no shown b1as as out of the 43,000 cases looked at from 2000-2009 there were 
only 25 total cases of a wh1te person usmg deadly force on a black person, the rest bemg 
e1ther wh1te on wh1te, black on whlte or black on black [Roman, 2012] (th1s very low 
sample s1ze requ1red Roman to use a pred1ct1ve regress1on analys1s model as 25 cases out 
of 43,000 1s stat1st1cally 1ns1gn1ﬁcant [2012]) Addltlonally, Chandler McClellan of the 
Nat1onal Bureau of Econom1c Research publ1shed a study usmg numbers from the 
Bureau of V1tal Stat1st1cs, and found that there was an mcrease 1n the number of wh1te 
men who are krlled because of self defense shoot1ngs between 2005-2007 n1 states 
w1thout a Duty to Retreat but wntes, “We ﬁnd no ev1dence to 1nd1cate that these laws 
cause an mcrease 1n hom1c1des among blacks” [McClellan, 2012] It 1s lmportant to 
remember that wh1le the rate 0f_]1lSt1 ﬁ3bl6 homlcrdes has nsen slrghtly 1n areas that 
removed the1r Duty to Retreat, 1t co1nc1ded w1th the contmurng pre-2020 drop m general 
hom1c1de rates and there 1s no study that shows 1f the use 1s a mechamcal shrft that 
resulted from hom1c1des be1ng reclassr ﬁed due to the change m statutes 
Removmg the Duty to Retreat w1ll st1ll requrre that prosecutors and courts look at the 
1ssues of necess1ty, 1.mm1nence, 1mmed1acy and reasonableness when 1t comes to usmg 
deadly force m a self defense s1tuat1on It w1ll st1ll requne that someone who uses deadly 
force 1n a self defense s1tuat1on do so lawfully and only when allowed by T1tle l7-A 
§l08-2 It w1ll not remove any cnrmnal or c1v1l l1ab1l1ty for nnproperly usmg deadly 
force 1f the use of force fa1ls to meet the already establlshed standard of reasonableness 
What 1t w1ll do 1s g1ve someone who 1s reasonably 1n fear for then l1fe, or the l1fe of 
then ch1ld or another helpless person, adequate t1me to make the proper dec1s1ons to use, 
or not use, and then apply the proper appl1cat1on of deadly force 1f necessary 
I hope you know by now the real world negatrve nnpact that the Duty to Retreat hasm 
a tense and scary l1fe and death s1tuat1on and I hope you can see the beneﬁt that remov1ng 
the Duty to Retreat has when 1t comes to support1ng v1ct1ms threatened by v1olent crlme, 
mcludmg the v1ct1ms of domestrc abuse
