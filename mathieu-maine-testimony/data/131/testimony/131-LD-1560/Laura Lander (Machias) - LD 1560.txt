LD 1560
Dear Maine Lawmakers,
I write to urge you to make decisions for common sense and safety in our state. The 
evidence does not support the claim that ‘stand your ground’ laws deter criminal 
activity and violence. In fact, several studies examining homicide and violent crime 
rates consistently show that the passage of stand your ground laws increase homicides
and gun injuries.
Stand your ground laws create a dangerous “shoot first” culture of violence and 
vigilantism. They have repeatedly allowed people to shoot and kill others even when 
they could have easily and safely walked away.
We don't want this in Maine. Please help to protect us from gun violence by voting no
on LD 1560.
Sincerely,
Laura Lander
