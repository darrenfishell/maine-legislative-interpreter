LD 1560
Though “Stand Your Ground” has an assertive, rights-based sound to it, what these 
laws have been shown to do around the country is to encourage firearm-bearing 
people to shoot first and ask questions later. 
In recent months, we’ve seen far too many innocent — and tragically young 
—Americans shot “by mistake” by homeowners. Our firearm-saturated culture is 
making it impossible for many to know and understand the safest ways to be 
responsible gun owners.
I firmly believe that de-saturating our society with firearms needs to happen. (There 
are more guns than people in the U.S., which is absurd. And guns are the number one 
cause of death for children and teens. That’s beyond tragic, and sadly preventable. For
the record, I do not support taking guns from law-abiding hunters and other 
responsible gun owners.)  But such a shift won’t occur until America’s gun culture is 
more rooted in “don’t shoot” ideology than “just shoot” behaviors. 
Just look at the intent of this bill: remove the duty of an individual to exercise 
restraint and thought before possibly taking a life.  Does that sound reasonable?
Maine is an independent-thinking state. I’m ever hopeful that our legislators will see 
the wisdom in encouraging and legislating a more thoughtful approach, and vote 
against LD 1560.
