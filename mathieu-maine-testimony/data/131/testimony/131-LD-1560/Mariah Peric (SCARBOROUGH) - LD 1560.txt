LD 1560
Testimony of Mariah Peric
before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 1560 - An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual 
Exercising Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing Certain Acts 
upon Demand
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Mariah Peric and I am a resident of Scarborough.  As a mother of two and 
pediatric nurse, the gun violence epidemic in this country keeps me up at night and 
horrifies me daily. 
I am writing in opposition to LD1560 because stand your ground laws create a 
dangerous “shoot first” culture of violence and vigilantism. They have repeatedly 
allowed people to shoot and kill others even when they could have easily and safely 
walked away.  We have seen multiple cases of this in the news in the past few weeks 
alone. Additionally, Stand your ground laws may embolden individuals, often with a 
history of violence, to escalate conflicts and kill. States have deemed justified killings 
of victims who were facing away, retreating, or even lying on the ground when they 
were shot.
This is not OK. Please, help us keep our children safe. I want my children to continue 
coming home from school... alive.
