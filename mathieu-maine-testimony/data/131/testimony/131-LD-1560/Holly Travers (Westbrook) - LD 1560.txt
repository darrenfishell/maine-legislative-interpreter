LD 1560
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. I am Holly Travers, a retired dietitian 
and seamstress living in Westbrook.
I am speaking in opposition to LD 1560. I care about the proposed law because of an 
experience I had many years ago. I was awakened in the middle of the night by a 
violent banging on my apartment door. I thought at the time that the intruder would 
break down the door and I was terrified. The banging stopped and in the morning a 
neighbor came by to apologize. Her boyfriend had been drinking the prior night and 
had mixed up her doorway with mine.
My story illustrates my concern with LD 1560. A person viewed as a threat could in 
reality be: disoriented, lost, ill, injured, asking for help or just unaware of how their 
actions are alarming others. They could be canvasing for a political cause or raising 
money for their school sports team. The person feeling threatened could be in a state 
of: panic, terror, anger, rage, indignation, or any combination thereof. They may 
suffer from anxiety or PTSD.
A law that allows a person exercising self-defense to use deadly force when they 
could have safely retreated gives a green light to acting aggressively before knowing 
with certainty what the threat actually is.
In conclusion, the phrase 'stand-your-ground' is more appropriate for a place of battle 
where the combatants are clearly recognized as enemies and there is no question 
about deadly threat. But we live in neighborhoods where strangers may be family or 
friends of other neighbors. Justice requires that we act judiciously before taking the 
life of another. Retreating when it can be done safely allows us time to make an 
informed judgement regarding a perceived threat. I feel strongly that this committee 
should oppose LD 1560 as is is hazardous to public safety.
Thank you for hearing my testimony.
