LD 1560
I am writing to state my strong opposition for LD 1560. The last thing our state needs 
is more latitude for violence. As evidenced in other states, "Stand Your Ground" laws 
lead to civilians shooting and killing people with impunity. We live in a country 
where a ring on the wrong doorbell can get you shot. Where turning around in the 
wrong driveway can get you shot. Where being a teenager walking down the street 
with candy in your pocket can get you shot. Please don't take Maine down the wrong 
path and make us all less safe with laws like this.
