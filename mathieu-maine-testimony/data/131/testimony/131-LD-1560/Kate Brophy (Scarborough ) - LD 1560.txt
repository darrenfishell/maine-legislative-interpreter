Testimony of Kate Brophy before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety
Committee,
in OPPOSITION to LD 551 An Act to Strengthen Maine Citizens' Second 
Amendment Rights by Allowing the Discharge of Firearms on Private Property That 
Is Within
500 Feet of School Property in Certain Circumstances, (OR)
in SUPPORT of LD 1340 - An Act to Prohibit the Sale or
Possession of Rapid-fire Modification Devices
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Kate Brophy and I am a resident of Scarborough. I am a mom of 3 young kids
and want to feel confident about putting them on the bus each morning, confident 
about taking them grocery shopping or to crowded sporting events.
Research shows that when more people are carrying firearms in public, violent crime 
rates rise. We all want to keep our families safe, so firearms should not be allowed 
within 500 feet of school property where children are playing and learning.
Federal and state laws ensuring that schools are gun-free zones have helped make 
K-12 schools even safer, significantly reducing gun violence in these places.
School-associated student homicide rates decreased after the federal laws restricting 
guns within 1,000 feet of schools were adopted in the early 1990s.
Thank you for your time
Kate Brophy
