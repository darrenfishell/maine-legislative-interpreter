LD 1560
Dear committee members please Support LD 1560 strengthens Maine’s “Stand Your 
Ground Law” by removing the duty of the victim to retreat or comply with the 
criminal’s demands. Mainers should not be required to comply with or hide from 
criminals to protect themselves. This bill would empower and protect law-abiding 
citizens. And 
LD 624 strengthens existing law that expressly prohibits the State of Maine from 
creating any kind of gun-registry. This bill closes loopholes in existing law that could 
be exploited to create a quasi-gun registry in Maine.
Both of These Bills are a Safeguard and Protection to Law Abiding Mainers. Thanks
