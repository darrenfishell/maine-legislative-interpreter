LD 1560
I support LD 1560.
The right to self-defense is crucial in our country, and this legislation would provide 
clarity and further support it.  
Maine is a state known for the safe, responsible ownership and use of firearms.  
This law would NOT 'make it easier' for someone to be an aggressor; that is not what 
it does.  It protects lawful citizens from being legally harmed by utilizing their rights 
ONLY under the proper circumstances while following established law.
