Testimony of Suzanne Merkelson before the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee, in OPPOSITION to LD 1560 - An Act to Remove the Duty of an 
Individual Exercising Selfdefense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing 
Certain Acts upon Demand
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Suzanne Merkelson and I am a resident of Portland and a new parent of a 
5-month old, very concerned about his safety. Stand your ground laws create a 
dangerous “shoot first” culture of violence and
vigilantism. They have repeatedly allowed people to shoot and kill others even when 
they could have easily and safely walked away. Stand your ground laws may also 
embolden individuals, often with a history of violence,
to escalate conflicts and kill. States have deemed justified killings of victims who 
were facing away, retreating, or even lying on the ground when they were shot. I do 
not believe that stand your ground laws make our state safer and I worry about the 
impact they could have in emboldening a "shoot first" mentality.
