M31119 TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ 
Ought Not to Pass - LD 1560 
An Act to Remove the Duty of an Ind1v1dualExerc1s1ng Self-defense to 
Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performmg Certain Acts upon Demand 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE & PUBLIC SAFETY 
May 9, 2023’ 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representat1ve Sahsbury, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J o1nt 
Standmg Commlttee on Cr1m1nalJust1ce & Publ1c Safety, greetmgs My name 1s Mlchael 
Kebede, and I am the Pollcy Counsel at the ACLU of Mame, a statew1de organ1zat1on commltted 
to advancmg and preservlng c1v1l r1ghts and c1v1l l1bert1es guaranteed by the Mame and US 
Constltutlons On behalf of our members, we urge you to oppose LD 1560 
Th1s b1ll would amend Maine’s current self-defense statute to 1ntr0duce “Stand Your 
Ground” law 1nto Ma1ne’s cr1m1nal code Enact1ng th1s b1ll would g1ve a person 1n Mame the 
r1ght to use deadly force to defend themselves Wlthout a duty to retreat from a dangerous 
s1tuat1on Such a law would l1kely lead to lncreases 1n v1g1lante Justlce, loss of due process, anda 
r1se m raclal d1spar1t1es when _1ur1es determ1ne who 1s ent1tled to a Stand Your Ground defense 
We urge you to l‘6_]6Ct th1s b1ll X
) 
F1rst and foremost, th1s leg1slat1on 1s um1ecessary Ma1ne law currently recogmzes a 
person’s rlght to self-defense, and does not mclude a duty to retreat when 1n one’s own home and 
not the 1n1t1al aggressor See 17-A M R S A §108(2)(C)(3)(a) Mame law also allows the use of\ 
deadly force when 1t 1s reasonable to do so See zd §l08(2)(A) Th1s reasonableness\ 
requ1rement 
g1ves Ma1ners the ab1l1ty to protect themselves wh1le recogn1zmg that 1t 1s always better to 3.V01CI D? 
taklng a llfe 1fposs1ble/ 
Second, Stand Your Ground laws _]eopard1zp due process rlghts The most ser1ous hbertyl 
depr1vat1on that a person can 1nﬂ1ct 1s takmg another person’s llfe The 1rrevers1b1l1ty ofa 
hom1c1de ineans that an error dlscovered after the fact cannot be corrected later By 1ncreas1ng 
the c1rcumstances 1n wh1ch pnvate 1nd1v1duals may use lethal force wlthout fear of 
consequences, Stand Your Ground laws mcrease the number of people who are k1lled wlthout

due process of law For example, after the passage of Fl0r1da’s Stand Your Ground law 1n 2005, 
the number of legally _]ust1ﬁable hom1c1des trlpled accordlng to data from the F londa Department 
of Law Enforcement 1 
In the ﬁve years before the law’s passage, Florlda prosecutors declared 
“]LlSt1ﬁabl6” an average of 12 klllmgs by prlvate c1t1zens a year In the ﬁve years after the law 
passed, that number _]llII1pCd to an average of 36 Justrﬁable kllllngs per year 2 FBI statlstlcs 
conﬁrm srmrlar mcreases 1n a number of other states w1th Stand Your Ground laws3 
Fmally, beyond the potentral for an mcrease 1n l'10II1lC1d6S, Stand Your Ground laws 
create mcreased poss1b111t1es for d1spar1t1es based on race 1n our cr1m1nal legal system Because 
Stand Your Ground 1s a defense, 1t w1ll be up to ]LlI‘l6S to declde whether someone’s shootrng was 
Justlﬁed when prosecutors elect to press charges Unfortunately, data conslstently show that 
_]LlI‘OI‘S ﬁnd shootlngs of Black people to be Justlﬁed more than shootlngs of wh1te people, and 
shootrngs by whlte people of Black people to more often be Justlﬁed than the shootlngs of whlte 
people by Black people 4 The raclal _]llSlZl06 1mpl1cat1ons of Stand Your Ground laws are so 
severe that 1n 1ts report on problematrc vrolence agamst Aﬁ'1can Amer1cans 1n the Umted States, 
the Inter-Amerrcan Commlsslon on Human Rlghts rncluded Stand Your Ground laws as laws 
that should be eradlcated5 
Mame already has racral d1spar1t1es 1t must contend wrth In South Portland, Black people 
make up 3 5 percent of the c1ty’s populatlon but 15 percent of the people arrested, andm 
Portland, they make up ﬁve percent of the c1ty’s populatlon and 17 percent of the people

exacerbate those d1v1s1ons would take us 1n the wrong d1rect1on Stand Your Ground laws are 
Lmnecesv sary, they open the door for extra]ud1c1al k1ll1ng wrthout due process of law, and they 
exacerbate racral d1spar1t1es 1n our cr1m1nal Justlce system 
For these reasons, we urge you to vote ought not to pass
