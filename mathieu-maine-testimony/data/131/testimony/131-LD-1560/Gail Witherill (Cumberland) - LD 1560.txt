RE: LD 1560. An act to remove the duty of an individual exercising self-defense to safely 
retreat or abstain from performing certain acts upon demand (i.e. a Stand your Ground or 
Shoot First Law) 
 
 
Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
 
My name is Gail Witherill and I live in Cumberland.  I write in opposition to LD 1560 which 
proposes to remove the duty of an individual exercising self-defense to safely retreat or 
abstain from performing certain acts upon demand.  Such a change in the law would give 
Mainers tragedies such as the recent one where an innocent teenager, unarmed, was killed 
when he mistakenly went to the wrong address.  We in Maine have the benefit of hindsight 
and experience of states that have enacted laws such as this proposal.  Allowing people to 
shoot first and evaluate the situation later does not make any of us safer and sets us up for 
more innocent deaths by gun violence.   States that have enacted laws such as this  have 
increased homicides, not fewer.  Maine will not be a safer place with LD 1560.  Vote ONTP on 
LD 1560. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Gail Witherill 
Cumberland
