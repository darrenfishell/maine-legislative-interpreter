This bill mentions 'exercising self-defense' and it leaves it up to the homeowner to 
determine if he/she needs to defend themselves. So - they get to define if they are 
threatened. Then, they get to 'stand their ground' and shoot the individual who is 
'threatening' them. 
We've seen many examples of this 'stand your ground' in the US. A young man shot 
because he knocked on someone's door. A young woman shot because the car she was
in backed into someone's driveway. This is not ok.  I'm thinking that a criminal could 
set up his/her home as a fort. A gun at every window and door. Don't tread on them. 
I haven't feared my neighbors - and I don't want to start fearing them. I don't want to 
tell my (future) grandchild that he/she must not knock on any door, unless he knows 
who lives there. What a world.
