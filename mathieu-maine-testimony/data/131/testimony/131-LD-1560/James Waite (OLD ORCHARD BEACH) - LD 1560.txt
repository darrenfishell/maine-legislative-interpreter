LD 1560
I'm writing in support of LD 1560, "An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual 
Exercising Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing Certain Acts 
upon Demand." 
I think most people will retreat when possible, but when they can't they can't. This bill
will ensure that those people will not face criminal prosecution just because 
somebody else thinks they should've or could've retreated. Self-defense is our natural 
right.
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1560.
Sincerely, James M Waite
