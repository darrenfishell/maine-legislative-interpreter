A 2020 study pubhshed m the Journal of the Amerzcan College of Sugeons comparing the ﬁve 
years before states began enactmg these laws (2000-2004) to the 13-year period following their 
enactment (2005—20l7), found overall homicide rates increased by 11% in stand-your-ground 
states yet decreased by 2% in states ﬂiat did not have such laws A 2022 study by Oxford Univ

kids playing in the yard of someone who doesn't want them there or some drunk guy stumbling into the 
wrong house, you're encouragzng people to possibly use deadly physical for ce where it shouldn 't be 
used " His warning was prescient Witness the tragic, unwarranted recent shootings of a teenager, a young 
woman, and two cheerleaders shot just because they mistakenly went onto the wrong property or in the 
wrong car
