LD 1560
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice an Public Safety Committee,
I urge you to oppose LD 1560. Evidence does not support the claim that ‘stand your 
ground’ laws deter criminal activity and violence. In fact, several studies examining 
homicide and violent crime rates consistently show that the passage of stand your 
ground laws increase homicides and gun injuries. This law will not make the public 
safer. Please believe in the evidence and protect the public.
