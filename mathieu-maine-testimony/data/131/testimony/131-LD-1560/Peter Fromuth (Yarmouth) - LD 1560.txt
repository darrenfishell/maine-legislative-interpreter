Fromuth Testrmony, May 9, 2023 
Charrs Beebe-Center and Salrsbury, and Members of the Commrttee My name 1s Peter 
Fromuth, I’m a resrdent of Yarmouth and an attorney I speak today 1n opposrtron to L D 1560, 
An Act to Remove the Duty of an Indrvrdual to Safely Retreat or Abstarn from Performrng 
Certarn Acts upon Demand 
Thrs brll rs a deadly solutron rn search of a non-exrstent problem It pretends to ensure the rrght 
to self~defense, thrs rrght 1s not 1n danger As you srt here today Marne law provrdes you and me 
the rrght to use force, up to and rncludrng deadly force, to protect ourselves or others and our 
property 
Self-defense rs an afﬁrmatrve defense That means 1f the defendant ’s evrdence rs found credrble, 
rt negates crrmrnal or crvrl lrabrlrty even 1f the prosecutron can prove that the defendant 
commrtted the alleged acts 
Mame ’s V€I’ .SIOi’I rs very powerful and very fact specrﬁc Let’s look at what rt permrts 
If you see someone commrttrng or attemptmg to commlt arson on your land you may use 
deadly force to the extent you reasonably belreve rt necessary to stop them (Sec 104) 
If someone unlawfully entered or attempts to enter your home and you reasonably belreve they 
are commrttrng or lrkely to commrt another crrme and that deadly force IS necessary to 
termlnate the crlmmal trespass You must ﬁrst demand they leave, unless you reasonably 
belreve but not 1f rt would be dangerous to make the demand (Sec 104, 108) 
You are _]LlS'[1 ﬁ6d rn usrng deadly force when you reasonably belreve 1t’s necessary to stop 
someone from krllrng, krdnapprng, robrng, or raprng another person (Sec 108) 
When you reasonably belreve that someone has entered your home wrthout permrssron and to 
rnﬂrct bodrly 1n] ury you may use deadly force that you reasonably belreve 1s necessary to 
prevent rt (Sec 108) 
Outsrde the home, Ma1ner’s lrcense to use force rs balanced by therr duty to retreat when they 
can safely do so But safely rs key It means the duty stops when you cannot safely wrthdraw 
from the attack, whatever rt rs 
And rnsrde yom home rf you are not the aggressor you are not requrred to retreat 
The balance between the self-defense rrght and the duty to retreat, whrle very srtuatron specrﬁc 
and often complex has served us well Marne consrstently has one of the lowest homrcrde rates 
111 the country 
Most states have now 1€]6Ct6d thrs balancrng of rrght and duty Therr chorce has gone badly 
Research shows homrcrde rates rrsrng sharply 1n states adoptrng Stand Your Ground laws, and 
fallrng or ﬂat rn states that drd not 
Marners already have ample legal protectron to use force to defend themselves Don’t grve legal 
cover to people who would use lethal force wrthout legrtrmate grounds Please oppose LD 1138
