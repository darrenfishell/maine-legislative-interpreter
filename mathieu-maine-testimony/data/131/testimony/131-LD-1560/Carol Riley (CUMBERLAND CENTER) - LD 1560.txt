LD 1560
Distinguished Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee;
My name is Carol Riley, and I am a resident of Cumberland Center. I am writing to 
ask for your opposition to bill LD 1560. Evidence does not support the claim that 
'stand your ground' laws deter criminal activity and violence. Several studies 
examining homicide and violent crime rates consistently show that the passage of 
these laws increase homicides and gun injuries. Can you see how these laws can 
create a dangerous "shoot first" culture of violence and vigilantism? Shoot first...we 
have seen this play out in our country when a teenager went to the wrong house to 
pick up his brothers, or another teenager turned into the wrong driveway, etc, etc, etc. 
Looser gun laws are killing our children and citizens. Please vote NO.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Carol Riley
