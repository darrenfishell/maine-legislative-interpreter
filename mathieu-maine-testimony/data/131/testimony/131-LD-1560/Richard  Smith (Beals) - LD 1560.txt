LD 1560
Honorable committee members, 
Maine's duty to retreat requires a victim to exhaust all other options, as seen through 
the eyes of investigators after the fact, before defending themselves from an attack. It 
is naive to think that turning and running is always a safe option, as there are times 
when a perpetrator may be younger, faster, and/or more agile than their intended 
victim. 
The alarmist cry that a "stand your ground" self-defense law will turn our streets into 
the Old West tv show tales of constant shootouts has and rivers of blood has not rung 
true in any of the states where stand your ground laws exist, and they won't ring true 
in Maine. 
It's time for Maine to stop demanding victims be extra victimesque, and that's why 
LD 1560 ought to pass!
Thank you
