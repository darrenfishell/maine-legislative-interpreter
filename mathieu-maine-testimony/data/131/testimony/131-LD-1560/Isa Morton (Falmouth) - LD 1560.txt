LD 1560
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
& Public Safety Committee — my name is Isa Morton. I am a resident of Falmouth 
and a concerned citizen. 
I urge you to oppose LD 1560 — An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual 
Exercising Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing Certain Acts 
upon Demand.
Evidence does not support the claim that ‘stand-your-ground’ laws deter criminal 
activity and violence. In fact, several studies examining homicide and violent crime 
rates consistently show that the passage of stand-your-ground laws increases 
homicides and gun injuries. Why? Because laws like this perpetuate fear, breed a 
“shoot first” mentality, and embolden individuals, often with a history of violence, to 
escalate conflicts. 
Passing LD 1560 will only lead to more violence in our communities. 
Let’s learn from other states. Recent national news of the past few weeks continues to
prove that ‘stand-your-ground’ laws are not effective — but rather, lead to the 
unnecessary escalation of violence and the murder of innocent people. 
Maine is smarter than this. This bill does NOT reflect the way life should be.
Please do your part in keeping our communities safe by opposing LD 1560. Thank 
you for your time.
