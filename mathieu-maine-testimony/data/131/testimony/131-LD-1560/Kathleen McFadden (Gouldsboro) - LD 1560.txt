LD 1560 “An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual Exercising Self-defense to 
Safely Retreat or Abstain from Perfonning Certain Acts upon Demand” 
Thank you Senator Beebe Center and Representative Salisbury and Esteemed 
Members of the Cnmmal Justice Committee 
My name is Kathleen McFadden and l am a supporter of Moms Demand Action for Gun 
Sense in America. l live in Gouldsboro and am sorely disappointed to see my 
Representative who endeavors to serve our community well as a co-sponsor This bill 
clearly represents the gun lobby and white supremacist doctrine and not the citizens of 
Maine 
LD1560 IS taken directly from the gun lobby's “Stand Your Ground,” playbook and isa 
license to kill. This bill encourages people to shoot ﬁrst and ask questions later, even 
when the option to safely retreat and avoid armed confrontation IS present. This bill 
permits people to use deadly force as a ﬁrst resort rather than a last resort. Stand Your 
Ground laws serve to promote armed vigilantism, are associated with an increase in 
homicides, and have an unacceptable racially biased component in the application of 
the criminal _|US'llC8 systemz . In Shoot First states, homicides of non white victims are 
deemed justiﬁable ﬁve times more frequently than when the situation IS reversed3 This 
bill lS dangerously irresponsible and would do far more harm than good. 
For decades, the gun lobby has not only enabled access to guns by anti-government 
and white supremacist extremists through its advocacy against common-sense gun 
laws, and has also worked to harness their fixation on guns to shore up its own political 
power, in doing so, the gun lobby has ampliﬁed extreme-right politics to new and 
broader audiences as evidenced by this bill being brought forth by well intentioned but 
misguided legislators I urge the committee to vote ought not to pass.
