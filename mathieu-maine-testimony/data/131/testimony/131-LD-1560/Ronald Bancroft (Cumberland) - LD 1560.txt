Ronald Bancroft
Cumberland
LD 1560
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, my 
name is Ronald Bancroft and I am a resident of Cumberland. I am a Maine native, 
hunter and fisherman, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and Vietnam veteran. I 
am writing to oppose LD 1560. one of the first things they taught us at the Naval 
Academy was not to engage with a stranger with a gun if there was a prudent way to 
withdraw. The so called "Stand your ground " laws tend to escalate rather than calm 
confrontation. The outcomes are often unfortunate. Let common sense prevail.
Ronald M. Bancroft
