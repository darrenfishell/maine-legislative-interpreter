LD 1560
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
Years ago, I took a self-defense course taught by a black belt karate teacher and this is
what he taught us:
“There is much more to defending yourself than learning to fight back.  The objective 
of self-defense training is never to destroy an attacker or potential threat.  You train in
order to learn to first avoid, and, if avoidance isn't possible, second, to control and 
finally to escape a dangerous situation while minimizing injury to yourself as well as 
to other parties involved.”  This is the safest course of action and is the same as 
Maine’s current law of “duty to retreat”.
LD 1560 would change this and turn Maine into a “Stand your Ground” state.  It 
would also make Maine, a relatively safe state, more dangerous.  Statistics show that 
states that adopt “Stand your Ground” laws see an increase in gun homicides.
The people of Maine are good people.  We accept each other despite our differences. 
Maine is a place where you can still pull into someone’s driveway and ask for 
directions, where people stop to help you if your car breaks down.  Let’s keep it this 
way.  We don’t want to turn our state into a place without empathy – without respect 
for the sanctity of human life in the name of self-defense.
Please oppose LD 1560
