LD 1560
Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee,
my name is Caroline Culbertson of Pownal, Maine, and I am voicing my 
OPPOSITION to LD 1560:An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual Exercising 
Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from Performing Certain Acts upon 
Demand. 
This is a dangerous bill, as we recently saw with Ralph Yarl, the unarmed teen who 
was shot when he went to pick up his brother and mistakenly went to the wrong 
house. And then another young woman in New York state was shot in her car when 
she mistakenly pulled down the wrong driveway. How many of us have, at one time 
or another, made a mistake and pulled into the wrong driveway? 
Stand your ground laws may embolden individuals, often with a history of violence, 
to escalate conflicts and kill. States have deemed justified killings of victims who 
were facing away, retreating, or even lying on the ground when they were shot.
One study of cases in which stand your ground was used as a defense in Florida from 
2005 through 2012 found that in 79% of the cases where such claims succeeded, the 
defendant could have retreated to avoid the confrontation, and in 68% of successful 
claims, the person killed was unarmed.
Please vote "ought not to pass" on this bill. Thank you.
