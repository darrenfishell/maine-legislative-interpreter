Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Criminal Justice
& Public Safety Committee—
My name is Megan Turner. I am writing to voice my opposition to L.D. 1560, the 
Stand your Ground bill. I do not believe we need this law in Maine, especially as we 
now know that similar bills in other states have only led to tragedy.
 
I currently live in Falmouth, but I’m originally from Maryland. When I was a 
teenager, a drunken man showed up outside our house in the middle of the night. He 
started hammering on the door and screaming incoherently. My sister, mother, and I 
were all terrified, but my dad, always cool under pressure, quickly called the police 
and talked to the man (behind a locked door, of course) until the police arrived. By 
the time they did, the man had mostly passed out on our porch and was taken into 
custody without incident. This situation could have ended very differently if my father
had been armed, if he had thought it was in his right to use deadly force against the 
man who ended up being too drunk and disoriented to harm anyone.
 
I believe Maine should keep the “duty to retreat” statue already in place and allow 
people the moment or two needed to assess a situation to see if they are in fact in 
danger. Enacting the Stand your Ground bill would prove a huge mistake and would 
only lead to unnecessary death and heartache.
