Dear Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Rebecca Roth, and I live in Cape Elizabeth.  I write in in OPPOSITION 
to LD 1560.
Evidence does not support the claim that ‘stand your ground’ laws deter criminal 
activity and violence. In fact, several studies examining homicide and violent crime 
rates consistently show that the passage of stand your ground laws increase homicides
and gun injuries.  Specifically, a study of cases in which stand your ground was used 
as a defense in Florida from 2005 through 2012 found that in 79% of the cases where 
such claims succeeded, the defendant could have retreated to avoid the confrontation, 
and in 68% of successful claims, the person killed was unarmed.
