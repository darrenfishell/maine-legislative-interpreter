LD 1560
distinguished membersof the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name 
is Heather Keelty and I am a resident of Portland. I am a mom of two small children. 
Fortunately, Iâ€™ve never been a direct victim of the senseless gun violence that is 
perpetrating our country. However, this  issue deeply concerns me. I am writing to 
strongly oppose Bill LD1560 as evidence does not support the claim that stand your 
ground laws  deters criminal activity and violence. Actually, evidence is now showing
that the passage of stand your ground laws increase homicide and gun injuries. You 
need to look no further than the awful acts of the last few weeks in this country.  stand
your ground laws create a dangerous shoot first culture of violence and vigilantism. I 
am a home health physical therapist who goes to peoples homes daily to help them 
regain  function and improve quality of life. I am now becoming scared that if I knock
on the wrong door, someone may shoot me. Sadly, this is a reality. please oppose this 
law to protect me and all of the innocent people in this world and to deter violence in 
America
