Testimony in opposition to LD 1560 
An Act to Remove the Duty of an Individual Exercising Self-defense to Safely Retreat or Abstain from 
Performing Certain Acts upon Demandl 
Dear Chair Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee 
My name is Lynn Ellis and I live in Brunswick As I have previously stated in past testimony, I am 
a retired social worker I am concerned with the surge in gun violence locally and across the 
country The trauma to our psyche is real and problematic When we explore gun violence 
prevention measures we primarily look to the increase in ﬁrearm sales in our state and our 
country A Brooking Institution study supports that observation, noting, "When Americans are 
concerned about their personal security, they buy ﬁrearms " With the onslaught of gun violence 
it I5 understandable for us to seek ways to feel more secure. However, I don't believe having 
more ﬁrearms accessible, is supporting this narrative. \ 
Rand Gun Policy Analysis states "Alternatively, by lowering the legal risks of using deadly force, 
these laws could encourage the escalation of aggressive encounters, resulting in an overall 
increase in firearm homicides or lI'l_|Lll'l €S Furthermore, the greater likelihood of facing a citizen 
willing to use a firearm defensively under these policies could induce criminals to carry ﬁrearms 
more often and thus increase the share of violent or property crimes involving firearms"
\ 
Stand your ground laws may also embolden individuals, often with a history of violence, to 
escalate conflicts and kill These laws allow individuals to provoke a fight and then kill the 
person they provoked_ 
Yesterday, I heard repeated messaging from testifiers insisting on more equity in their rights to 
own guns I am concerned that this growing trend of using a firearm to settle differences among 
family and friends, as we have seen in recent months, is creating a norm that it is the "best" 
way to protect oneself. Innocent lives are being lost in greater number with this belief It is an 
act of incredible ethical irresponsibility to allow things to continue as they are today 
LD 1560 must not pass
