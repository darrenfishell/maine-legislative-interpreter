Opposition to LD 1560 Stand you ground law Cathy Daphna Harris 
Dear Distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee My 
name is Cathy Harris from Mechanic Falls I am a retired teacher, a parent and a grandparent 
I am deeply opposed to this bill Maine is the kind of state where if your car breaks down in 
front of a residence you can go to that residence and seek help Yet this bill would allow a per- 
son to use deadly force if they felt threatened without even knowing the circumstances 
There are thousands of miles of ATV and snowmobile trails in this state Someone could be 
perceived as a threat and shot just for losing their way and ending up accidentally on the 
wrong property 
Years ago my husband worked for a land surveyor There were numerous times whena 
gun owner would confront them with his weapon while they were doing property line surveys, 
especially in remote locations This law would allow those paranoid land owners to shoot ﬁrst if 
they felt threatened in any way 
There are so many instances when an innocent person could be perceived as a threat and 
shot Census workers, Door Dash accidentally going to the wrong house, even politicians 
knocking on doors, campaigning for votes In other states with Stand Your Ground laws there 
have been cases where innocent people were shot and those states also have increases in 
homicides* 
I know of an elderly gentleman who lives alone in Aroostook county, I believe in Mr Ardel|’s 
district Mr Ardell is a big man That old gentleman might be afraid of him if he came into his 
yard campaigning for re-election This law would give that gentleman the right to use deadly 
force, if he perceived a threat His family is concern for their father but they certainly would not 
want him to shoot someone in his drive way 
Yesterday Miss LaPa|ge stated that having to use your gun for deadly force is the worse 
day in your life Imagine how much worse that day would be if you made a mistake and the 
person you shout was innocent 
Our present law already give homeowners the right to defend themselves They can go 
into their house and stand ready with their weapon They can call the police It does not leave 
them defenseless 
What if the person they thought was the bad guy leaves and they see he wasn’t a bad guy 
at all Just an innocent politician looking for votes, or a teenager selling chocolate bars 
Shooting a gun outside your house puts everyone in that neighborhood in danger of being 
shot by stray bullets Even hunters are taught in hunter safety courses to be sure of their target 
before they fire This law allows for careless mistakes in the name of a perception of threat, 
even if that threat is non existence It also gives a murderer an excuse when a homicide has 
been committed 
The men who hunted down Ahmaud Aubrey used this law as an excuse for killing that in- 
nocent man Even though they were eventually convicted of a hate crime, those men were not 
arrested at first Anyone with that kind of hate in their heart, should not have this law to hide 
behind 
Thank you 
*JournaI of American College of Surgeons found overall homicide rates increased by 11 % in 
states with Stand Your Ground Laws yet decreased by 2% in states without this law
