Testimony in Favor of LD 1671 
An Act to Reduce the Income Tax to 4.5 Percent on the Lowest Tax Bracket and 
Remove Low-income Families from Taxation 
May 3, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Taxation. My name is Jack Ducharme and l proudly represent the 
people of Cornville, Madison and Norridgewock in the Maine House of Representatives. 
I come before you today to present LD 1671, An Act to Reduce the lncome Tax to 4.5 
Percent on the Lowest Tax Bracket and Remove Low-income Families from Taxation. 
State personal income tax and corporate revenues have been coming in at record levels 
in recent years. At the end of fiscal 2022, the revenue surplus recorded by the State of 
Maine was nearly $1.3 billion. Revenue forecasts in December 2022 showed nearly 
$500 million in surplus revenues. The April 2023 forecast shows surplus revenue 
estimates at the end of fiscal 2023 at $223 million. 
In April of 2022, the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations of the 130"‘ Legislature 
agreed to return some of the surplus revenue to taxpayers as part of LD 1995, the 
supplemental budget. The pandemic was waning but many people were still hurting 
and since the State had plenty of money, it made sense to return some of it to those 
that paid much of it in. Over the summer of 2022, the State of Maine sent out over 
880,000 “tax refund" checks billed as Pandemic Relief for $850 for a total of nearly $755 
million. 
In December 2022 when the 131*‘ Legislature convened we were presented with LD 1, 
An Act to Provide Funding for Winter Emergency Energy Relief and to Finalize the 
COVID Pandemic Relief Payment Program. This bill had been negotiated with the chief 
executive and the leadership of the Legislature as a means to help people who were 
struggling to make ends meet in the face of rapidly escalating energy prices. Winter 
was coming, oil prices were high, electricity prices were going up and people were 
hurting. Since the State of Maine had surplus revenues, they negotiated another return 
of over-collected tax money billed as energy assistance checks for Maine taxpayers. 
Those checks were $450 each and cost over $473 million. 
Between these two returns, the State of Maine returned over $1.2 billion to Maine 
taxpayers. lt is clear to me that the State of Maine is over taxing it’s citizens. With

Maine’s balanced budget amendment, any revenue projection must be accounted for in 
either spending or be returned to the taxpayer. We must look at doing some structural 
changes to our tax law. 
For this reason, I have proposed LD 1671, An Act to Reduce the Income Tax to 4.5% 
on the Lowest Tax Bracket and Remove Low Income Families from Taxation. 
Permanent structural tax relief is a logical continuation of the refund checks and builds 
on other relief provided in 2022, which included; 
6 $65 million for an expanded pension deduction. 
0 $26 million for increasing the earned income tax credit, 
6 $59 million for the revamped education opportunity tax credit program. 
The above initiatives have largely excluded higher earning individuals who bear much of 
the tax burden in Maine. There is almost no ability to create equal tax cuts between 
earners and due to the structure of Maine’s tax code, it is nearly impossible to give tax 
relief only to those in the lower income strata. Passage of numerous tax provisions 
aimed at lower income Mainers to reduce, or outright eliminate, their tax liability means 
this is a policy area where there may be limited benefit. However, there is a significant 
benefit to be felt by more than 400 thousand taxpayers. Further, LD 1671 should ensure 
that anyone making less than $50,000 pays little to no Maine State income tax when all 
deductions and credits are applied. 
According to taxfoundationorg, Maine collected $3,973 per person in tax collection in 
2021. This was the 15"‘ highest in the nation. Maine’s lowest tax rate of 5.8% is higher 
than Massachusetts which has a 5% flat tax. it is higher than New Hampshire where 
there is only a 4% tax on interest and dividends. This tax will be phased out by 2027 
according to the New Hampshire Bureau of Revenue Administration. As we look to 
attract new Mainers to our state, we must recognize that our tax burden is significantly 
higher than neighboring states. Maine currently ranks 3"‘ in the nation in highest overall 
tax burden according to WalletHub, a personal finance company. 
lt is time to consider structural tax relief for the hard-working people of Maine. By 
targeting the lowest income tier, we can reduce the tax burden of the largest portion of 
Maine taxpayers. Maine Revenue Services estimates that this tax relief proposal will be 
a revenue reduction of about $194 million in 2024. 
l am aware that there are a number of bills in the pipeline that are proposing tax relief 
for Mainers. It is clear that something must be done to slow the over-collection of taxes 
from hard-working Mainers. We owe it to Maine people to consider this. We MUST 
consider it if we expect to attract more people to Maine, people that we desperately 
need to help our businesses fill their many job openings. Please consider LD 16971 as 
a way to provide much needed tax relief. Working Maine families will be grateful. 
Thank you for considering this bill and l’m happy try and answer any questions that you 
might have.
