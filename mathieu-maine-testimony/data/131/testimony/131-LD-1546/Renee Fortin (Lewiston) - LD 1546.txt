LD 1546
Dear Members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee, 
I am writing in support of LD 1546 An Act Regarding Nondiscrimination in Financial
Services.
Communist China has been using ESG for a long time against it citizens, and here is a
clear definition of exactly what it is. 
What Is ESG:  Environmental, Social, and Governance?
An evolving constellation of metrics which are assessed to develop numerical scores 
that impact stakeholders, be they businesses, investors or individuals.
Political tool to use business and financial institutions to advance progressive 
ideology.  Being pushed by green activists, woke cultural warriors, global elites, and 
the big businesses they control.
Here's why you should support it ~ Because capitalism and the free-market system 
encourage individual initiative and a prosperous economy, thereby benefiting Maine 
workers and families.
It will Prevent discrimination against any individual, association, or business through 
use of social credit or environmental, social, and governance score or the like. 
Vote "ought to pass" LD 1546
