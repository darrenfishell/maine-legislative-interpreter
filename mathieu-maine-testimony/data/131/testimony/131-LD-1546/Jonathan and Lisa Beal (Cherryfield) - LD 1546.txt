An Act Regarding Nondiscrimination in Financial Services
In Opposition to LD 1546
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services:
We, Jon and Lisa E. Beal of Cherryfield, Maine, wish to register our concern over the current move 
toward implementation of ESG's, Central Bank Digital Currencies, and global surveillance systems 
masquerading as “advances” in financial technology.
We the people of Maine wish to remain FREE in our financial (and all other) transactions.  We do not 
wish to have “scores” and be admitted or denied services in the marketplace because of them.  We do 
not wish to be surveilled.  We do not wish to be monitored.  We do not desire to be any further under 
the thumb of the government and all its regulations than we already are.  What we do wish is to remain 
SOVEREIGN—secure in our rights, our persons, our papers, our homes, and the entirety of our private 
information.
Insomuch as this bill, LD 1546, still allows financial institutions to discriminate based on ESG scores 
(as long as they tell people), we cannot support it in its current form.  We would prefer a bill that would
outright ban consideration of non-financial criteria by financial institutions.
Thank you.
Jon and Lisa Beal
Cherryfield, ME
