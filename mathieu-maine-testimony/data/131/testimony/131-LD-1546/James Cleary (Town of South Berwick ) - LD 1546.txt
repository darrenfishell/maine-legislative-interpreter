Town of South Berwick 
LD 1546
This is my first time submitting testimony for a bill. I felt compelled to submit 
testimony in favor of bill LD1546 for a few reasons. Financial institutions have an 
obligation to best serve customers through proper management of funds. Just as there 
should not be discrimination in housing, there should not be discrimination in 
financial transactions based on an individual's affiliations, politics, or other 
extraneous factors. It is not right or fair for financial institutions to leverage funds 
from individuals to push ideological agendas that the individuals themselves do not 
support.
Thank you for your consideration.
