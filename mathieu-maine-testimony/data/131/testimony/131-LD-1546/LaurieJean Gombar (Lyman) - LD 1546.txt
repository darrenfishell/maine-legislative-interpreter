LD 1546
Senator Bailey,  Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the committee, I 
implore you to vote ought to pass LD1546 to prevent discrimination.  This bill 
prevents financial institutions from using subjective and changing ideology based 
criteria such as Environmental, Social, and Governance scores in granting services to 
otherwise qualified individuals and businesses.  It also increases transparency by 
requiring disclosure of additional non-financial non traditional criteria if any upon 
which their decision is based. I just explained to my 4 year old that I was writing 
about defending her right to buy and sell, no matter what she believed.  It blows me 
away that we have to spell this out.  ESG scores are not what our forefathers fought 
for- rather against that tyranny.
Vote ought to pass LD 1546  Thank you.
