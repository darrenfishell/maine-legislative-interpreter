DEPARTMENT OF PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCAL REGULATION 
OFFICE OF SECURITIES 
In Opposition to LD 1546 
“ An Act Regarding Nondiscrimination in Financial Services ” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage Insurance and 
Financial Services 
April 27, 2023 at 1:00 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, distinguished members of the 
Committee, my name is Judith Shaw, and I am the Acting Administrator of the 
Ofﬁce of Securities. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1546. 
The Ofﬁce of Securities oversees and regulates the securities industry, 
referred in the bill as the investment services industry, in order to protect Maine 
investors. Tihe authority to regulate the securities industry is set forth in the Maine 
Uniform Securities Act which grants sole jurisdiction and authority to the 
Securities Administrator. My preliminary opposition to LD 1546 is that it

circumvents the Securities Act and transfers oversight and enforcement authority 
related to the provisions of the bill to the Bureau of Financial Institutions. 
Aside from this technical issue, the apparent purpose of the bill, to prevent 
ﬁnancial institutions from refusing service to consumers, does not readily translate 
to the securities industry. In order for the capital markets to ﬁinction most 
effectively, a broad array of investment products and opportunities must be 
provided. Rather than preclude the offering of products, the goal is to present a 
myriad of options with appropriate disclosures of any attendant risks so thata 
client or customer can make an informed decision about which products they wish 
to invest in. Our current regulatory oversight is focused, not on limiting 
investment products that comply with existing laws and regulations but, rather, to 
assure investors are provided the information and disclosures needed to make 
informed, independent decisions about how to invest their funds. 
To the extent there are any limitations on services and products in the 
securities industry, it is as a result of a careful and fulsome analysis of the ﬁnancial 
characteristics of the investor including their net worth and risk tolerance coupled 
with their own social sensibilities. In the end, it is the investor ’s decision Whether 
to invest in a particular offering or investment product or strategy. The inclusion 
of “investment services ” Within the scope of LD 1546 is thus unnecessary because
investors already have meaningful choices when determining whether a given 
investment product aligns with their investment strategies and preferences. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. While I am opposed to LD 
1546, if the Committee were to decide to move forward with the legislation, I 
respectfully ask the bill be amended to exclude “investment services ” from the 
deﬁnition of “ﬁnancial institution ” that is included in the bill. 
I would be happy to answer any questions the Committee may have now or 
at the work session.
