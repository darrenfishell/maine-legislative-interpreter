LD 1546
I agree with the following: "This bill requires financial institutions to provide 
financial services to clients based on quantitative, impartial, risk-based financial 
standards. If a financial institution uses nonfinancial, nontraditional, or subjective 
criteria in approving or denying financial services for a person, the financial 
institution must disclose the criteria to the Department of Professional and Financial 
Regulation, Bureau of Financial Institutions, and the client."
Therefore, please vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1546.
