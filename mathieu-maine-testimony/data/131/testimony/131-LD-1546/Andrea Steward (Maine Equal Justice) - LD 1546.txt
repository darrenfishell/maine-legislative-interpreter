T estimony
on

of
Maine
Equal
Justice
in
Support
of
LD
1546,
An

Regarding
Nondiscrimination
in
Financial
Services.
April

2023
Good
morning,
Senator
Bailey ,
Representative
Perry ,
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint 
Select
Committee
on
Health
Coverage,
Insurance
and
Financial
Services.
My
name
is
Andrea 
Steward,
I
use
she/her
pronouns,
and
I
am
a
policy
advocate
at
Maine
Equal
Justice.
W e
are
a 
civil
legal
services
or ganization,
and
we
work
with
and
for
people
with
low
incomes
seeking 
solutions
to
poverty
through
policy ,
education,
and
legal
representation
to
increase
economic 
security ,
opportunity ,
and
equity
for
people
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
of fer 
testimony
in

of
LD
1546.
What
This
Bill
Does
This
bill
requires
financial
institutions
to
provide
financial
services
to
clients
based
on 
quantitative,
impartial,
risk-based
financial
standards.
Why
Maine
Equal
Justice
Supports
LD
1546
Studies
have
exposed
the
financial
institution's
long
discriminatory
history
towards
specific 
populations
1
,
particularly
towards
people
of
color ,
women,
and
other
mar ginalized
groups.
2
Discrimination
in
financial
institutions
is
a
racial
equity
and
women’ s
rights
issue
that 
disenfranchises
people
and
keeps
them
from
fully
and
equitably
engaging
in
the
financial 
economy .
3
Individuals
face
numerous
barriers
including
but
not
limited
to
“inadequate
access 
to
financial
services;
higher
rates
of
denial
of
loans
and
banking
services;
higher
interest
rates, 
costs,
and
fees
for
consumers
and
small
businesses;
discriminatory
racial
profiling;
and

discrimination
by
racially
biased
algorithms
…”.

Financial
services
have
been
denied
to 
consumers
on
the
basis
of
their
race,
ethnicity ,
gender ,
or
other
“immutable
factors”.

Discrimination
has
significant
costs
to
society
and
the
economy
Studies
have
found
discrimination
in
financial
services
based
on
race,
ethnicity ,
gender ,
and
other
“immutable
factors”
6
.
These
factors
have
led
to
the
denial
of
financial
services
including
higher
fees
and
interest
rates,
the
ability
to
cash
a
check,
lowering
of
credit
score,
and
denying
“otherwise
credit-worthy
individuals
and
businesses
equal
access
to
loans.
7
”
These
barriers
often
force
people
to
go
outside
of
the
financial
system
which
leaves
them
susceptible
to
predatory
and
subprime
lending.
Financial
discrimination
is
pervasive
for
Black,
Latinx,
and
Asian
communities
cutting
across 
multiple
sectors
including
mortgages,
banking,
asset
management,
insurance,
auto
lending, 
and
credit
cards.
8
Denials
for
service
were
experienced
by
Latinx
individuals
at
more
than 
three
times
the
rate
as
their
white
counterparts,
even
within
the
same
income
bracket.
9
For
the 
Black
community ,
the
disparity
persists
despite
high
income
levels.
A
2022
survey
found
68 
percent
of
Black
people
who
earned
more
than
$100,000
annually
had
at
least
one
negative 
encounter
with
the
financial
system.

The
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
released
a
statement
in
2022
citing
the
potential
costs
that
discriminatory
practices
can
have.
One
of
these
practices,
algorithms,
has
shown
widespread
discrepancies
in
gathering
data.
Consumer
advocates,
investigative
journalists,
and
scholars
have
shown
how
data 
harvesting
and
consumer
surveillance
fuel
complex
algorithms
that
can
tar get
highly 
specific
demographics
of
consumers
to
exploit
perceived
vulnerabilities
and
strengthen 
structural
inequities.
W e
will
be
closely
examining
companies’
reliance
on
automated 
decision-making
models
and
any
potential
discriminatory
outcomes.
1 1
Communities
of
color
received
a
disproportionate
share
of
subprime
mortgages
in
the
years
before
the
housing
crash
and
were
therefore
at
a
higher
risk
of
facing
foreclosure.
Prior
to
the
Great
Recession,
35%
of
subprime
loans
were
issued
to
borrowers
who
qualified
for
prime
loans,
and
blacks
and
Latinos
were
80%
and
70%
respectively
more
likely
to
receive
subprime
loans
than
white
borrowers,
after
controlling
for
income,
credit
scores,
and
other
factors.Furthermore,
when
facing
foreclosure,
black
and
Latino
mortgage
holders
were
76%
and
71%
more
likely
to

have
lost
their
homes
than
white
borrowers.
This
loss
of
wealth
in
the
form
of
home
equity
is
especially
devastating
in
communities
of
color
because
black
and
Latino
communities
hold
49%
and
52%
of
total
assets
in
home
equity ,
compared
with
just
28%
for
white
families.
1 2
Mortgage
Data
indicates
that
the
higher
interest
rates
often
imposed
on
people
of
color
attributed
to
a
$250
million
to
$500
million
annual
disparity
from
mortgage
refinance
loans.
1 3
Banks
were
more
likely
to
require
additional
documentation,
such
as
income
tax
statements,
from
Hispanic
and
Black
individuals
32%
and
28%
respectively ,
when
applying
for
a
business
loan
compared
to
their
white
counterparts
1 4
.
This
is
despite
each
of
them
having
similar
businesses,
income,
and
credit
profiles.
A
study
by
the
National
Community
Reinvestment
Coalition
on
PPP
loans
in
2020
found
disparities
in
44%
of
all
cases.
1 5
Additionally ,
Banks
provide
more
information
about
loan
products,
interest
rates,
and
encourage
white
males
to
apply
more
often
than
white
or
Black
women.
1 6
Many
individuals
are
unaware
of
disparate
outcomes
given
the
lack
of
individual
comparability
in
the
financial
market.
Even
when
individuals
are
aware
of
the
discriminatory
practices
they
felt
they
were
unavoidable
within
the
market.
1 7
The
foreclosure
crisis
is
one
example
that
has
shed
light
on
the
severity
of
discriminatory
practices
and
the
deep
financial
cost
to
the
economy
as
a
whole
as
it
“depleted
overall
housing
wealth
and
led
to
millions
of
job
losses”.
1 8
These
predatory
practices
cause
a
lack
of
public
trust
and
confidence
in
the
financial
system.
According
to
X,
discriminatory
financial
practices
have
cost
the
U.S.
economy
$16
trillion
since
2000.
1 9
People
who
experience
financial
discrimination
are
blocked
from
building
wealth
2 0
and
experience
harm
to
their
physical
and
emotional
health.
2 1
All
of
this
plays
a
role
in
contributing
to
the
racial
wealth
gap.
