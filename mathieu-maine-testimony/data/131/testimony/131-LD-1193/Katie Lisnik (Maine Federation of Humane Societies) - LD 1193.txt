Testimony in Support of  LD 1193 – An Act to Allow Residents of Low -income Housing to Keep Pets  
 
Senator  Tipping , Representative Roeder , and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing,  
 
My name is Katie Lisnik  and I am the Executive Director the Greater Androscoggin Humane Society in Lewiston 
and Secretary  of the Maine Federation of Humane Societies (MFHS). I am offering  testimony in support of  LD 
1193  on behalf of MFHS  whose  board also includes representatives from  the Animal Refuge League of Greater 
Portland in Westbrook, Animal Welfare Society in Kennebunk, Bangor Humane Society in Bangor, Greater 
Androscoggin Humane Society in Lewist on, Humane Society of the United States,  Maine State Society for the 
Protection  of Animals in Windham, PAWS Animal Adoption Center in Camden, Pope Memorial Humane Society 
in Thomaston, Kennebec Valley Humane Society in Augusta, and Spirits Place Cat Sanctuary in St. Albans , as 
well as Animal Control for the towns of Cumberl and, Yarmouth and North Yarmouth .  
 
Lack of pet -inclusive  housing is an all too common refrain at animal shelters when owners come in to 
surrender beloved pets.  Looking at the data of my own shelter in Lewiston for the past year, close to 20% of 
our intak e of owned animals was specifically noted as related to housing.  Our two most common reasons for 
surrender (too many animals and unexpected custody) often have an underlying housing issue as well . For 
example, an animal may be surrendered because of “too many pets” when an owner had to move and couldn’t 
find housing that wou ld allow their large dog, or three cats.  
 
Maine rs are  a pet -loving people  and firmly believe that pets are part of the family . We consistently rank in the 
top two states for cat owners hip rates, with approximately 50% of households owning at least one cat. 
National research has also shown that approximately 75% of renters own pets.   Through the pandemic  and 
now more than ever , our shelters have seen increased need across the board - Pet owners unable  to afford 
basic pet food, veterinary care, and housing challenges. While these challenges are not exclusive to public 
housing, many of our clients do live in these units and struggle to keep a roof over the heads of their 
companion animals.   
 
We feel this bill will help to ease a significant  burden many pet owners are currently facing.  By increasing the 
number of rental units that are truly pet -welcoming, we can keep pets in the families where they are loved and 
cherished, as well as increas ing the pool of families able to consider adopting a homeless animal in need.  
 
Overall, this bill has significant potential to help pets and the people who love them across our state.  We 
encourage you to vote Ought To Pass on LD 1193 . Thank you for your consideration and opportunity to submit 
testimony . 
 
Sincerely,
