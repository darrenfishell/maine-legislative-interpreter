Dear Members of the Committee,
 I only want to say this: if monetary compensation/reimbursement will be provided to 
property owners, housing authorities, and management companies to cover the costs 
for the flea treatments, flooring and wall replacement, and odor removal, and 
whatever litigation fees that may occur from nearby property owners or neighbors 
who are not happy with the 2 St. Bernards a tenant brings with them, especially if one 
of them mauls someone, then, by all means, pass this legislation.
And no breed or size restrictions? How many cats can a person be allowed to have in 
a one-bedroom apartment? Does this apply to emotional support animals as well? Can
a person have 2 pets AND an emotional support animal? There is so much potential 
for cruelty to animals within this legislation, it suggests there are animal haters among
you.
And if you do pass this legislation, please, please do not complain that there isn't 
enough affordable housing for Mainers because this kind of inane, irresponsible 
legislation clearly announces what little concern the state of Maine has about it. When
government makes renting a property so completely unappealing and unmanageable, 
what happens then?
