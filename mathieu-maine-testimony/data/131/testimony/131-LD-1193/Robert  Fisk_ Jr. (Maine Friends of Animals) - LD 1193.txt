                         Founder and President of Maine Friends of Animals 
In SUPPORT of LD 1193 “An Act to Allow Residents of Low-Income Housing to 
Keep Pets”    Committee on Labor and Housing 
                                                          April 6, 2023
Good afternoon Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the 
Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Robert Fisk, Jr., founder and president
of Maine Friends of Animals, giving Maine animals a voice for over 25 years — 
located in Falmouth. 
We support LD 1193 much in the same way we supported a recent bill to prevent dog 
breed discrimination by insurance companies. Even housing advertised as 
“pet-friendly” tends to be restrictive with breed and weight restrictions or 
unnecessarily high monthly pet fees that results in excluding a large segment of the 
pet owners as eligible tenants. Many in this category find housing more challenging 
and/or unaffordable. 
When the vast majority of pet owners consider their pets as part of the “family”, we 
should do all we can to keep them together whenever we reasonably can. Housing, 
moving and landlord issues are amongst the most commonly cited reasons for pet 
surrenders. This bill helps mitigate it in low income public housing where tenants 
love their pets like everyone else does. We should try and help keep that bond in tact, 
especially for those who need it most. 
Lastly, as I am sure others will raise, we all know their is a housing shortage in this 
state. More the reason to restrict policies that place an arbitrarily and discriminatory 
restrictions on otherwise responsible pet owners. LD 1193 is a win for the animal, the 
tenant, landlord and the public. We urge the Committee to vote “Ought to pass’ on 
LD 1193. I would be happy to answer any questions for Committee may have.
