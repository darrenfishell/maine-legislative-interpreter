To The Distinguished Members of the Labor and Housing Committee 
From Daniel J. Bernier, representing the 
Central Maine Apartment Owners Association working in conjunction with the Rental 
Housing Alliance of Southern Maine, the Greater Bangor Area Owners’ and Managers ’ 
Association, the Capital Area Housing Association, and Lewiston Auburn Landlord 
Association. 
Re: LD 1193 An Act to Allow Residents of Low~Inc0me Housing to keep Pets 
I am submitting this testimony in opposition of the bill. 
Landlords in Maine already have to allow service animals and assistance animals 
pursuant to the Maine Human Rights Act. The deﬁnition of an assistance animal is much 
broader than the deﬁnition of a service animal. Many landlords in Maine do currently allow 
pets. 
However, this bill will make landlords less likely to take section 8 vouchers. This bill will 
make it harder to evict in that tenants will be able to assert that they are being evicted due to 
their pet as a defense to an eviction action. Some apartment owners permit pets, some charge an 
additional pet fee or pet deposit, some do not want pets and some will be concemed about the 
type of pet. It should be noted that if the animal meets the deﬁnition of a service animal or 
assistance animal the landlord must take the animal and cannot charge a pet fee or deposit for 
them. 
At a time when we have many people complaining about the cost of housing, creating a 
reason for landlords to not take a section 8 voucher because they are subjecting themselves to 
more regulation in how they handle pets is just likely to make the housing crises worse.
