Senator Tipping, ‘ Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing, my name is Ben Chipman, and I represent Senate District 28, 
which includes part of Portland in Cumberland County. learn before you today to introduce LD 
1193, “An Act to Allow‘ Residents of Low~income Housing to Keep Pets.” A l' 
This legislationwould ensure that residents in low-income public housing will be able to own 
and keep common hou As Aehold- pets. LD 1193 would require the Maine State Housing Authority, 
municipal housing authorities, and other third parties to allow residents of low-income housing 
to have pets without implementingiother rules such as, requiring declawing.' 
Pet-inclusive housing policies are.good for animals, tenants, and owner operators. This' 
legislation would prioritize creating more stable and affordable pet-inclusive housing and 
commit to policies and programs based on human-animal relations. 98%.of pet owners consider 
their pets important family members. As a result, the needs of their pets directly informs their 
decision when ﬁnding housing. Unfortunately, 75% of pet owners struggle to ﬁnd housing 
because of the number of residences that don"t allow pets or enforce pet restrictions. This bill 
beneﬁts landlords as wellzover 80% of owner operators ﬁnd units that allow common household 
pets easier to ﬁll. A 'i
