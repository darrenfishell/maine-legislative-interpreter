LD 1193
Good morning,
I have reviewed the LD 1193 bill that is up for vote today. I have been in property 
management for over a decade. I have spent the last four years managing multiple 
Affordable Housing complexes up and down the Mid Coast Maine region. I would 
like to state my opinion on this matter as straight forward and concise as possible, if 
this bill passes I will go into another line of work. Bureaucracy such as what is being 
proposed here is making the job of Affordable Housing management impossible to 
perform. At some point in the future the system itself will implode if such measures 
continue to be forced upon management.
Thank you for your time.
