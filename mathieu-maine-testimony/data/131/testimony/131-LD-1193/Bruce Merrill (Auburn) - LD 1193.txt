This bill takes away even more rights from property owners.  Property owners are 
responsible for keeping up with their properties and making sure the tenants live in 
harmony.  There are many reasons certain buildings should not have certain pets.  
There are also many reasons certain tenants should not have pets.  Large pets that do 
not fit easily into the apartment.  Pets that attack other residents. etc, etc,   This bill is 
a disaster in the making.  If you want to see low income housing fall apart, then vote 
for this bill.
