Our company has serious concerns with this bill. Our pet rules are approved by 
MSHA HUD and RD and the insurance companies. We have many family properties 
in our portfolio. If this bill were to pass it would be a financial burden to our limited 
budgets with the rising costs we are facing in maintaining the buildings and keeping 
up with high electric and heating costs. We are limited in how much we can charge 
for a pet deposit and if we were to allow large and or multiple dogs in units the 
damages may be substantial at move out. Tenants with disabilities are allowed 
animals of any size and/or multiple service or emotional support animals under the 
law. One other factor is under this bill is that a family property with 30 units and each 
apartment decided to get 2 dogs of various sizes, can you imagine have 60 dogs on 1 
property and a few of them got loose and started fighting while a group of young 
children are outside playing. Imagine having 30-60 cats roaming around the property 
defecating where children are playing. Tenants in subsidized housing live on limited 
budgets and may have difficulty not only paying for food for all these pets but also for
vet care and vaccines. Yes we would have rules complying the animals be vaccinated 
but imagine the burden on the property managers to verify this every year, document 
it and write lease violations for animals not vaccinated. I could go on and on with 
other scenarios of why this would be bad legislation. Please look at the whole picture.
