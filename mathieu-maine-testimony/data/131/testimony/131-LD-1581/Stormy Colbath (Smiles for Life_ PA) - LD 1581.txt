Testimony of Stormy Colbath from Smiles for Life, PA, speaking in favor of LD 
1581: An Act Regarding Dental Hygienists and Dental Therapists . 
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the 
Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial S ervices, My name is 
Stormy Colbath . I have been a dental hygienist for over 30 years. I have been 
an independent hygienist for over 13 years. I live in rural Maine where 
dentistry is very limited. Not only is  there a lack of dental hygienists, but 
dentists as well. My patients deserve as much care as I can give them. I 
believe our degrees should be observed and honored and we should be 
allowed to treat our patients to the fullest of our potential. There have b een 
far too many rules and regulations that are only hurting our patients.  
 
 Iâ€™m testifying today to encourage you to support LD 1581 regarding dental 
hygienists and dental therapists . 
 
Thank you for your consideration of my testimony .
