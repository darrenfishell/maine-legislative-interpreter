Testimony of Denise I. Quinlan, RDH in favor of LD 1581: An Act Regarding Dental
Hygienists and Dental Therapists.
Senator Baily, Representative Perry, and esteemed members of the Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services, My name is Denise Quinlan. I 
have been a practicing Registered Dental Hygienist for over 35 years. I am testifying 
today to encourage you to support LD 1581 regarding dental hygienists and dental 
therapists.
It has always been a concern of mine that although dental hygienists are licensed 
professionals that have completed rigorous courses of study at accredited colleges, we
are required to be "supervised" in some capacity by a totally different profession.  
Dental hygienists must learn to interpret radiographs as part of our education . There 
are questions pertaining to radiographs on our board exams.  We know what we are 
looking at. It is unnecessary and creates a burden for the patient receiving care from 
an IPDH  to HOPE that a dentist will be willing to interpret radiographs for a 
hygienist that does not work for him or her.
Dental hygienists are required to undergo intense training to administer local 
anesthesia.  We are required to maintain competency in basic life support.
These training requirements are the same that dentists must complete. Why is it that a 
dental hygienist is granted a license to practice and a license to administer local 
anesthesia yet that license is contingent upon a separate profession being present in 
order to utilize it? Why must one licensed professional be "supervised" by another 
licensed professional ?
 I respectfully ask you to consider allowing Registered Dental Hygienists to utilize the
knowledge and skills that we must prove we've acquired in order to be granted the 
privilege of licensure.
