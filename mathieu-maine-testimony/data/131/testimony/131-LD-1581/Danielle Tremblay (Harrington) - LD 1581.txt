Dear Representative Mastraccio, Senator Grohoski, and distinguished members of the 
Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services Committee, 
My name is Danielle Tremblay from the town of Harrington. I am a licensed 
Independent Practice Dental Hygienist (IPDH) here in Maine and am practicing in 
Milbridge, which sits in Washington County. I am testifying in support of LD 1581: Act 
Regarding Dental Hygienists and Dental Therapists. Myself and my colleagues are 
strong proponents for the proposed revisions to streamline the verbiage relating to the 
scope of practice for dental hygienists, independent practice dental hygienists, public 
health dental hygienists, and dental therapists, as well as the adjustment to supervision 
requirements, as this allows more opportunity for us to utilize our skills and provide 
more comprehensive care in our respective communities. As health care providers in a 
rural setting, the opportunity to maximize our knowledge and training during every 
patient-provider interaction, particularly with the scarcity of dental professionals and 
longer distances residents often have to travel for care, is essential. 
Once this bill is passed, it is my hope that we can continue to build on these 
revisions and that we might consider other ways that we can make providing much 
needed dental services in the underserved regions of Maine more easily accessible and 
comprehensive. I believe that this can be achieved by allowing IPDH, along with other 
health care providers, the full capacity to utilize our training and well-earned authority to 
help our communities achieve and maintain the highest possible level of health. I would 
greatly appreciate your continued support.  
Sincerely, 
Danielle C. Tremblay IPDH, BS
