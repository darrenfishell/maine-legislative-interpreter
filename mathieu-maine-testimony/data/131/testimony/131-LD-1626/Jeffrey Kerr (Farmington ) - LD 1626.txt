Good Afternoon Senator Beebe Center, Representative Salisbury, and distinguished 
members of the Committee:
My name is Jeffrey Kerr and currently I sit on the board of Vistors in Franklin 
County.  In 2017 I was at a meeting where the sheriff recommended that I sit on the 
board of visitors. I was really honerd and thrilled that I could help the people in the 
jail and possibly my community. I thought this was great. After all my years of being 
on the board I still was asking myself what am I doing there. I finally came up with 
the answer to this question. I have a lived experience, both of mental health struggles 
and of being on the inside of those walls. People make mistakes and then they end up 
in jail but that does not mean they are bad. What it does means is they are troubled 
about something like I was many years ago.  
LD#1626 helps people who are being detained know that someone cares and that even
though they made a mistake we still care and want to help them. 
I just recently went to a jail that was helping the town out by growing food outside of 
the detention center and helping there town out, I wish that all detention centers were 
like this. Inmates were were always doing something that gave them a reason to live. 
I urge you too pass this bill so everyone can have a chance at life, I would be happy to
take any questions now.
