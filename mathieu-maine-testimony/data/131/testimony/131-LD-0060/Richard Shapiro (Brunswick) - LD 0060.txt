LD 60
I am writing in opposition to LD60.
    This law is designed to prevent a person from rushing out in a fit of rage, 
purchasing a gun from a dealer (as opposed to buying, borrowing, or stealing one 
privately), going through the federal background check etc. and then rushing off to 
shoot someone.  
    Yet, it destroys the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, to carry a gun, and to 
defend oneself for every person who discovers that THEY are under threat and need a
firearm for self-protection NOW.  
    How many of THOSE people will be beaten, how many of those people will be 
maimed, how many will be raped, and – how many will be shot?
    Unlike a person who ALREADY INTENDS TO BREAK THE LAW, and who, as 
I said, can always buy or borrow or steal a gun privately, or can go after the victim 
with their fists, a hammer, their car or a rock, the victim may not have any 
alternatives.  The victim may be incapable of fighting back without the assistance of 
the 2nd Amendment.  This proposal strips that away – without due process – without 
recourse – and without mercy.
    And, with a single stroke, this law eliminates gun shows.  With a single stroke of 
the pen – an entire industry and an important part of Maine's heritage is eliminated.  
I’m sure the those seek to disarm the law abiding find that an entirely beneficial side 
effect – I assure you that nobody else does!  And for what?  For nothing.
    And, what about the person who gets the opportunity to go hunting on short notice?
What about the competitor who’s pistol or rifle breaks just before a match?  This is 
simply an impermissible, and harmful, infringement on the 2nd Amendment.  
    Lastly, as is often the case with such bills, it is utterly unenforceable against private
sales.  
    To summarize – this bill does only harm.  It is all side effects and has no benefit.
    Please oppose this bad bill.
