LD 60
We can all agree that we would like to reduce gun deaths, including suicides.
LD 60, “An Act to Require a 72 Hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm” can
do just that.
Waiting period laws, which create a buffer between the time of gun purchase and gun 
acquisition, can help to prevent impulsive acts of gun violence. 
A waiting period can reduce suicide deaths.  Suicide attempts are often impulsive and 
involve little planning. Studies also suggest that some factors that incite gun violence 
are also impulsive.  A 72 hour waiting period can give people time to “cool off”, seek 
help or be recognized as dangerous.
In addition, waiting period can give law enforcement agencies additional time to 
complete background checks.
Please support LD 60 and make Maine a safer place to live.
