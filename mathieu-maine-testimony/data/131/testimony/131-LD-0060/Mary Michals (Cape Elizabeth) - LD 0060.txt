Requiring a waiting period for the obtaining a firearm after  purchase would prevent 
so many tragic crimes of passion:  homicide and suicide.  A person in a depressed 
state of mind should not be able to quickly obtain a deadly weapon.  This would help 
our veterans who die sadly by their own hands.  This seems so obvious that I cannot 
understand why it is not already a part of our gun safety regulatuons.  Please consider 
the innocent victims and the devastated family members left behind after homicides 
and or suicides.
