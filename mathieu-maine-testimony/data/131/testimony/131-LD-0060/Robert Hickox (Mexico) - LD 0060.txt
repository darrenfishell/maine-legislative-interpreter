LD 60
LD60: 72 Hour waiting period. This is combining with LD168 for Universal 
background checks. Our state constitution states "The right of the people to keep and 
bear arms shall never be questioned". Criminals are already prohibited from firearms. 
It is already illegal to transfer firearms to a prohibited person. There is no benefit to 
making it more difficult for law abiding cititzens to acquire self defense against 
criminals that get their guns from other means. Look at all the laws New York, 
Illinois and California has. How safe is it in New York City, Chicago and LA? Please 
stop trying to make Maine a gun free state like those places.
