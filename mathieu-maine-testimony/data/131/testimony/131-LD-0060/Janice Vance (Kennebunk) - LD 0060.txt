Janice Vance, Kennebunk ME 04043 
Testimony in Support of LD 60 
An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm 
Good morning, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. 
My name is Janice Vance and I live in Kennebunk. I am a member of the Maine Gun 
Safety Coalition, which raises awareness about the effects of ﬁrearm violence. I urge you 
to pass LD 60. 
We have all seen increases in shootings in public spaces, as well as in “family” and 
domestic violence shootings. In so many of these tragedies, the shooter was motivated by 
anger and grievance, and Wanted to “get even” with someone - a boss or an ex-wife, or by 
targeting a group or a school. The shooter in some cases impulsively bought a ﬁrearm~ 
often legally - and used it the very same day to murder or wound innocent people. These 
acts of anger happen every single day in our country. 
The second risk of someone buying a ﬁrearm and using it immediately is suicide. In 
Maine, we have a suicide-by- ﬁrearm rate that is one of the highest in the country — 89% 
of all ﬁrearm deaths in 2021. Accordingly, the state has recently committed to invest 
signiﬁcant funds to address suicide prevention. LD 60 could be a strong component of 
that program. 
In delaying the completion of a ﬁrearm purchase, LD 60 would give people time to work 
through their own worst instincts. Impulsively buying a ﬁrearm is not like impulsively 
buying a hat or a pair of shoes. It can be a life-changing act. I would like to thank Rep. 
Craven for introducing the bill, and I urge you to pass it.
