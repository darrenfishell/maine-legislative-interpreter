LD 60
Dear Representative Craven and Cosponsors Representatives Arford, Crafts, Dodge, 
Gramlich and White, and the e Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety. I 
am Megan Marquis of China, Maine. I am writing this letter in favor of LD60 An Act 
to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm.  
This bill requires a 72-hour waiting period between an agreement for the purchase of 
a firearm and its delivery to the purchaser. This waiting period provides a time period 
after the purchase of a gun to prevent the deaths with firearms that are driven by 
passion, anger or desperation. Domestic violence victims are five times as likely to be
killed when their abuser has access to a gun. Fifty-nine percent of all suicides are by 
guns. This waiting period is not long to cause an undue inconvenience to a new gun 
owner, but it will be long enough to make people sit with and think about what they 
are doing- to prevent crimes of passion or emotion, while also saving many more lives
in Maine. It's time we start being proactive in preventing harm. I am tired of death- 
especially when it could have been so easily preventable with a bill like this. 
I urge you to vote in favor of LD60 and establish a 72-hour waiting period after the 
sale of a firearm. Thank you for your consideration.
