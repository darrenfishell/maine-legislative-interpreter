LD 60
I strongly oppose LD 60.
This would be unnecessary burden on law abiding Mainers.
Please, support liberty and the rights of your constituents by opposing LD 60.
Following the horrific tragedy at MSU, the anti-gun democrats have already decided 
to politicize the shooting and introduce several unconstitutional bills that don’t 
actually prevent things like this from happening.  
Before the bodies were even cold, anti-gun figureheads were frothing at the mouth to 
spout how we need more gun laws that definitively would not have stopped this 
crime.
Background checks did not stop this murderer from obtaining a gun, not having a 
carry permit did not stop him from carrying the gun, the gun-free zone did not stop 
him from entering the zone with the gun, and the laws against murder did not stop 
him from murdering.
Criminals don’t follow the law, and no amount of new gun control would have saved 
these lives.
