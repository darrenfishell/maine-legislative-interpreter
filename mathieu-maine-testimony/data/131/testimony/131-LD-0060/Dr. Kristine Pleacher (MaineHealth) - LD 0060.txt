In Support of LD 60 
“An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm” 
April 3, 2023 
 
Honorable Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Members of the 
Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, I am a Portland resident, a pediatric 
critical care physician at Maine Medical Center, a member of the Maine Chapter of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Gun Safety, and a concerned citizen.  I 
am speaking today on behalf of the MaineHealth to request your support for this 
legislation.     
 
As part of our vision of “Working Together so our Communities are the Healthiest in 
America,” MaineHealth carefully identifies legislative opportunities to improve the 
health and well-being of Mainers. LD 60 requires a 72-hour waiting period between the 
purchase of a firearm from a licensed dealer and delivery of said firearm to the purchaser.  
This “cooling off period” has proven essential in preventing impulsive suicides and 
homicides, and thus we support this bill 
 
There is substantial data in the medical literature that firearm presence is associated with 
higher rates of suicide and homicide.i,ii,iii  It is estimated that 17% of homicides and 7-
11% of suicides could be prevented with a waiting period.iv  Firearms are one of the most 
lethal means of attempting suicide with a case fatality rate >90%.v  Only 10% of 
individuals who survive a suicide attempt go on to eventually die by suicide.vi Therefore, 
if we can reduce the lethality of the means used in a suicide attempt, we can save lives.   
 
Maine has high rates of suicide, particularly among our veterans.vii  Maine Veterans 
utilize firearms in suicide attempts at a disproportionate rate to non-military suicide 
attempts.viii  The suicide rate in Maine has also been increasing at a rate higher than the 
national average.ix While more can undoubtedly be done to help reduce suicides in 
Maine, this legislation is an important step.   
 
Please support LD 60. A waiting period between purchase and delivery of a firearm will 
save lives.
