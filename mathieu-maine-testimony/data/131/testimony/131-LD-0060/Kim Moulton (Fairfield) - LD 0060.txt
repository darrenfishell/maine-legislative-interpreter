Re: LD 60, An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm
Dear Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, 
My name is Kim Moulton. I am a resident of Fairfield, Maine. I am writing in 
opposition of LD 60, An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a 
Firearm.
There is no evidence that waiting 3 days - after the Federal Bureau of Investigations 
(FBI) has conducted a National Instant Criminal Background Check and concluded a 
person is not an unlawful or prohibit person - would lead to less crime or safer 
communities.
To deny a law-abiding person the exercise of their legitimate civil rights for an 
arbitrary period of time - when they are not suspected of a crime and during which 
time no additional investigation is preformed - is simply an injustice and an 
unnecessary burden.
 
I urge the committee to vote Ought Not to Pass.  
 
Respectfully,
Kim Moulton
