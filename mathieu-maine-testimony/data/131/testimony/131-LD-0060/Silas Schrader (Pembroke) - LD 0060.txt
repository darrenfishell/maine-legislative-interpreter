LD 60
Members of Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety,
My name is Silas Schrader, and I am from Pembroke, Maine. I am testifying against 
L.D. 168, L.D. 60, and L.D. 22.
What part about when it says in the constitution "shall not be infringed" do you not 
understand? These bills clearly infringe on the rights of the people to own and carry 
weapons. These bills shouldn't even be allowed to exist, yet here they are. It does not 
matter how little or how far they go; one inch is too many. We all know on both 
political sides that the end result and purpose of this will end in a total gun ban. 
Therefore, all three of these bills, L.D. 168, L.D. 60, and L.D. 22, should be totally 
rejected.
Thank you.
