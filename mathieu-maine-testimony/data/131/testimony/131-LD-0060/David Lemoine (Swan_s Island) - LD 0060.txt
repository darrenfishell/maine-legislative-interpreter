LD 60
Dear committee members, 
I am David Lemoine, from Swan's Island. 
I oppose LD 60, An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting After the Sale of a Firearm.  I 
will limit my reasons to 3.  
1. I spent many years as a law enforcement officer and know threats don't wait.  When
someone needs the means to protect themselves, they need it as soon as possible. 
Someone choosing to do harm can pick their time, but victims can't.
2.  Hunting seasons don't wait. If some one has their hunting rifle break or get stolen 
on a hunting trip, they would have to find a suitable replacement, go through the 
process to purchase it, then wait 72 hours before they can get it, and then make sure it 
is sighted in before they can get back hunting.  With a moose permit only valid for 
one specific week, that 72 hours is over half their season.  
3.  Most of Maine is rural.  I, for example, live on Swan's Island, a six mile ferry ride 
from Mount Desert Island.  The nearest gun shop I am aware of is in Ellsworth, over 
20 miles from that ferry.  If I buy a gun in Ellsworth, under LD 60 I would have to 
make a second trip to Ellsworth 3 days later to pick up my purchase.  That 26+ mile 
trip is 1.5-2 hours each way in the best of circumstances, then there is the ferry 
schedule to work around. I usually plan at least 5 hours round trip for one stop. If I 
saw a gun listed at Kittery Trading Post that I was interested in, I would have to travel
there to see it, decide to purchase, then return home.  Three days later, I would have to
travel back to acquire it.  That is a significant burden on a legal purchase.  
 I have yet to see where a waiting period has made any definitive difference in 
preventing harm, but I have seen where it would cause it.  
Thank you for your time.
