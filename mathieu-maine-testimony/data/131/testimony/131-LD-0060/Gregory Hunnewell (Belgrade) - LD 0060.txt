To Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
 
This testimony is in regard to Both LD 60 and LD 168. 
I will start out with the belief that there is no need to make changes at this time to the 
background check system that we currently have, we currently in my opinion have no issues with private 
sales and transfers to persons other than family, we would experience great difficulty with being able to 
let friends use our firearms for hunting at our hunting camp every fall. We have friends who come to 
camp every fall who do not bring their own firearms and rely on being able to use ours. 
 
The act to require a 72 hour waiting period after the sale is definitely not needed, I am going to 
throw out a scenario for you to ponder: Let us say I attend a gun show in Augusta and find a firearm I 
want to purchase from a licensed dealer, I agree to purchase the firearm and they do a NICS background 
check on me and I pass, I then find out that the dealer is from Caribou Maine and I have to wait 72 hours 
and then travel from Belgrade Maine to Caribou to pick up the gun after 72 hours, that trip consists of a 
3 hour and 53 minute trip (one way) to Caribou and the same time driving back to Belgrade. 
 
Both bills are ridiculous and are not needed. I have a State of Maine Resident Permit to Carry a 
Concealed Handgun and completed an enhanced background check from your Maine State Police to be 
able to be issued this permit. I look at the introduction of these two bills as an insult to me and others 
like me in the State of Maine 
 
PLEASE VOTE BOTH OF THESE LD60 AND LD168 AS OUGHT NOT TO PASS 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to your committee, 
Gregory Hunnewell Belgrade Maine
