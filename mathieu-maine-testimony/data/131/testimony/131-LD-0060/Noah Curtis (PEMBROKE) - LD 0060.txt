Noah Curtis
PEMBROKE
LD 60
My name is Noah Curtis and I am a resident of Pembroke. I am writing today in 
opposition to LD 60. I see this bill, and all anti gun bills, through the lens of our 
constitution, which simply states "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall 
not be infringed." This bill goes directly against that simple and to the point sentence. 
Laws like these also go against presumption of innocence by assuming that someone 
is buying a firearm to commit a crime. This bill will prevent law abiding citizens, who
have already followed the legal process to purchase a firearm by submitting to a 
background check, from possessing the firearms they have already passed the 
background check to purchase and it assumes they might go out and commit a crime 
with it. As a law abiding citizen, I find this insulting.
On a more personal note and to put it in a real life perspective, I have an aunt who is 
separated from her husband. If she felt an immediate threat to herself or her kids and 
wanted to get a firearm to protect her family, she would now have to wait longer than 
necessary or reasonable to do that. And would now have to live on a hope and a 
prayer nothing happens for those 3 days she would have to wait. 
Please vote against LD 60. Thank you.
