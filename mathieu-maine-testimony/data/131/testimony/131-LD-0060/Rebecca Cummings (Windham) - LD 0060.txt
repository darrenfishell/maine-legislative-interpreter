LD 60
I do NOT support a 72-hour waiting period after the purchase of a firearm. Law 
abiding citizens have a constitutional right to protect themselves and their property. 
This committee’s time would be better spent ensuring the laws regarding unlawful 
possession are enforced by state and local law enforcement agencies and that the 
district attorney’s office adequately charges/prosecutes individuals in violation of the 
law(s) already on the books. 
I urge this committee, and every elected official, to reject LD 60!
