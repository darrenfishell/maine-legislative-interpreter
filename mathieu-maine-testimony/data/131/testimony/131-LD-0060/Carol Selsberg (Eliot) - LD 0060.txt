4/3/23 TESTIMONY FOR LD 60 — REQUIRING 72-HOUR WAITING PERIOD 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, distinguished members of the 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, I am Carol Selsberg, an 85-year-old 
grandmother from Eliot, Maine to speak on behalf of LD 60 
Who needs a gun in a hurry? The American Academy of Pediatrics-67,000 
doctors—confirm that guns are the suicide weapon choice. The 9 states with at 
least 72-hour waiting periods boast 51% fewer suicides and a 17% decrease in gun 
homicides. in 2023, Maine was 12"‘ out of 50 for highest suicide rates (World 
Population Review). All evidence confirms this life-ending act is often impulsive. 
Over 75% of gun and non- gunowners support longer waiting periods (Gallup). 
ln 2022, 234 Maine’rs killed themselves. Suicide for those 10-35 was the 2nd 
leading cause of death (Kennebec Journal-8/26/22). On 3/20/23, quoting 
Kennebec Journal: “in all but nine states, most gun deaths are self-inflicted. The 
highest proportion is in Maine where 89% of gun deaths are suicides. ” Fifty-seven 
percent of ALL gun deaths nationally are suicides - 117,000 out of 206,000 in the 
past 5 years (The Center for Disease Control and Prevention). 
Maine veterans ’ suicide rates are significantly higher than the national average 
which is also very high (Dept. for Veteran’s Affairs). The U.S Defense Dept. 
Committee on Suicide Prevention recommends a 7-day waiting period because of 
this horrific data. A 3/10/22 Fact Sheet from the Center for American Progress 
reveals that in 2019, nearly 72% of the 4,332 suicides of current or former" military 
members used a gun. The FBl'reports a gun is used in domestic partner violence 
more than any other weapon so a cooling off time for someone who is having 
an angry meltdown or is a serial or momentary abuser can certainly save lives. 
A waiting period also gives the at-risk partner and children an opportunity to 
find safety elsewhere. 
Again, I have to ask: Who needs a gun in a hurry? 
Thank you for using your prime position to save lives with a lot more than thoughts 
and prayers.
