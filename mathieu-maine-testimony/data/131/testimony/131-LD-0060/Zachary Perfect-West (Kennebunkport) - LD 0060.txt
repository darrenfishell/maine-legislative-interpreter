LD 60
Please forgive my grammar and punctuation if it is lacking. I did my best.
Thank you!
LD 60 delays a citizens right to bear arms by 3 days. Potentially the person being 
delayed if this goes into law is a woman in an abusive relationship trying to leave her 
abuser. She has a right to feel safe and protect herself. If she feels that she needs a 
firearm to do that while she is fleeing/trying to find another place to live she is 
constitutionally protected to do it. It is unconstitutional if LD 60 becomes law. 
Imagine if you had to wait 3 days to be able to vote on voting day, just because the 
government says you have to. or you had to wait 3 days because you were granted due
process. It is not right! We have inalienable rights. Please respect them.
This is why I believe LD 60 should not become law.
