Testimony in Opposition to LD 60
An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety :
My name is Nathan Gould. I am from Winterport. I am giving this testimony in 
opposition to LD 60, “A n Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a 
Firearm.”
Presumption of innocence until proven guilty is a fundamental legal principle, but
this bill assumes the opposite. LD 60 posits that law abiding citizens cannot be trusted 
and must have their Second Amendment rights infringed upon.
Placing barriers to responsible gun ownership is not only unconstitutional, but 
dangerous. Firearms are frequently used in self-defense. We see high-profile cases such
as with Kyle Rittenhouse in 2020 in which he defended himself from three criminals in 
Kenosha, Wisconsin; in 2019 firearms instructor Jack Wilson defended his church in 
Texas from an attacker1; last year Elisjsha Dicken’s quick action prevented a massacre at 
a mall in Indiana2; just last February an armed bystander in El Paso stopped a shooter3.

It’s not only these front page stories, for there are also lesser known cases all the 
time. In Iowa4, Louisiana5, Georgia6, Arizona7,  Connecticut8, Michigan9, Florida10, and 
elsewhere in our nation, law abiding citizens exercise their right to defend themselves 
and those around them. It has been shown that firearms are used for protection more 
than 2 million times a year11. There are many cases in which the firearm does not need 
to be fired and just the presence of an armed citizen prevents an attack.
Firearms have been called “the great equalizer.” If a 100-pound woman is being 
stalked by a 300-pound man, she should not have to wait 72-hours to exercise her right 
to protect herself and her family. Such a delay could be catastrophic.
Those who wrote the Constitution of the State of Maine wisely recognized our 
natural right to self-defense in Article I, Section 16: “Every citizen has a right to keep 
and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned.”
I ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass, and I thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
