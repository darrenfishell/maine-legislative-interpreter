LD 60
Dear Honorable Members of the Committee,
I urge you to oppose LD 60 - An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the 
Sale of a Firearm.
LD 60 delays Second Amendment rights by imposing a three-day waiting period 
before an individual may receive a firearm that they lawfully purchase, with limited 
exemptions. There is no evidence that waiting periods reduce violent crime. Instead, 
this simply denies someone the ability to buy a firearm for urgent self-defense.
