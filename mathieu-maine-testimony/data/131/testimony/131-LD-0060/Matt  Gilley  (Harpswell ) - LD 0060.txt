Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center and representative Salisbury and distinguished 
members of the criminal justice and public safety committee. My name is Matthew 
Gilley and I am a lifelong resident of Harpswell. I am writing to you today in 
opposition of ld 60. This would create a 72 hour waiting period to transfer a gun. This
and the next bill is only going to make criminals out of law abiding gun owners and 
have little to no effect on criminals since they don’t follow the laws we have now 
hence being criminals. This bill would prevent the women whose abusive partner was 
just released early from jail from protecting herself. This would make the person that 
lets their friend shoot their new gun at the range together a criminal. As we’ve seen in
some of the most recent mass shootings these people had manifestos that they had 
planned these events well in advance. Creating a waiting period is only going to stop 
law abiding citizens from protecting themselves.
