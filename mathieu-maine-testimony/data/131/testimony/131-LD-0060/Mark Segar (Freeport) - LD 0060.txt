Testimony for April 3, 2023 in support of LD 60_ 
Sen. Beebe—Center and Rep. Salisbury: 
Thank you and the members of the Joint Committee for this opportunity to 
testify in support of LD 60. l’m Mark Segar, from Freeport. 
Over many years as an educator, advocate, father, grandfather, and 
neighbor, l’ve seen both sides of an important aspect of youthful behavior, 
both wonderful and terrifying. 
On the one hand, exuberant spontaneity and the joy it generates. 
On the other, reckless impulsivity and the risk of harm it carries. 
Without the capacity for forethought, self-control and awareness that the 
fully developed brain provides, adolescents and young adults may act in 
ways that can lead to creativity, or to catastrophe. In an instant. 
It is a terrible thing to have seen, as l and others have, the tragic 
consequences for a young person, their family and friends. 
This waiting period legislation can reduce danger, can prevent unintended 
consequences and irreversible harm, can allow time for reconsideration, 
for intervention, for life. 
LD 60 is common sense legislation. lt tempers real risks. lt can save lives 
without reducing rights. It will make Maine a safer place for all its citizens. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Mark W. Segar 
Freeport
