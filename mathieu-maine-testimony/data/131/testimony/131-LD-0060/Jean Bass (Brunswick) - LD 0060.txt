I write in support of LD 60 and LD 168.  I am appalled that today in Maine, anyone 
can buy a gun, including a semi-automatic, large capacity weapon, without a permit 
or background check.  I was also shocked to learn that a shooter who killed 22 people 
in Canada last year bought his weapons in Maine.
After the most recent school shootings, I am sure you know that gun violence is the 
most frequent cause of child deaths in this country.  That is simply not acceptable.  
And so I urge you to - including, when legislation arises, banning assault-style 
weapons, which have no purpose other than to kill human beings.
