LD 60
I oppose LD 60 "An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a 
Firearm".
LD 60 delays Second Amendment rights by imposing a three-day waiting period 
before an individual may receive a firearm that they lawfully purchase, with limited 
exemptions. There is no evidence that waiting periods reduce violent crime. Instead, 
this simply denies someone the ability to buy a firearm for urgent self-defense.
Constitutional rights should only be restricted with sufficient due process of law. Due 
process limits restrictions on constitutional rights to only serious convictions and 
adjudications that provide procedural protections to the accused, which results in 
more reliable proceedings. The Right to Keep and Bear Arms should not be treated as 
a second-class right and should only be restricted when sufficient protections are in 
place. 
Again, I oppose I oppose LD 60 " An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After 
the Sale of a Firearm ", and it "ought not to pass".
