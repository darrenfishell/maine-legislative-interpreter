Alice Sandzen
Portland
LD 60
My name is Alice Sandzen and I am a mom. I did not know love until I became a 
mother. I also did not know anger and fear until I became a mother. My love, anger, 
and fear are all linked and shared by mothers across this state and country. We love 
our children fiercely, fear that one day we may lose them to gun violence and are 
justifiably angry because gun deaths are preventable. When you consider this bill, 
please consider that a 72 hour waiting period is not an inconvenience, it is a necessary
safety measure that will protect the lives of Maine's children. Our children deserve 
this. Our children need this.
