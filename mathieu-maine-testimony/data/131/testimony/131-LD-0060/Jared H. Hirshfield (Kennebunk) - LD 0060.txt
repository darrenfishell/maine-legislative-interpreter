Opposition
to
LD
60 
"An
Act
to
Require
a
72-hour
waiting
Period
After
the
Sale
of
A
Firearm"
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the 
Committee
on
Criminal
Justice
and
Public
Safety ,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit 
testimony
regarding
LD
60.
Current
federal
law
mandates
that
those
purchasing
firearms
from
a
retailer
or
federal 
firearms
licensee
be
subject
to
a
National
Instant
Criminal
Background
Check
(NICS).
If
one 
passes
their
federal
background
check
they
are
allowed
to
continue
with
the
sale
and
leave
with 
their
firearm.
Those
that
do
not
immediately
pass
the
background
check
are
subject
to
a
waiting 
period
while
the
FBI
conducts
further
checks
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
approve
or
deny
the 
transfer .
Furthermore,
the
Bipartisan
Safer
Communities
Act
expands
background
checks
if
a 
purchaser
between
the
ages
of
18-20
years
of
age
requires
further
investigation.
Under
this
law 
the
FBI
can
request
an
additional
seven
days
to
make
their
determination.This
bill
does
nothing 
to
address
firearms
crime
and
misuse
that
is
not
already
addressed
in
federal
law .
A
72
hour
mandatory
waiting
period
would
do
nothing
to
prevent
further
crime
or
stop 
prohibited
persons
from
procuring
a
firearm.
Rather
it
would
create
an
immense
burden
to
those 
who
lawfully
purchase
firearms.
