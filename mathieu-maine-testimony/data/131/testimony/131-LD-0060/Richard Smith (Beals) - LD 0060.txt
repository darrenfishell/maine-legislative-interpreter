LD 60
Esteemed committee members, 
LD 60, the bill for a 3-day waiting period to receive a firearm after purchase, will do 
nothing to curb violent crime. This bill will only serve to cost law-abiding citizens 
extra money, both in travel costs and/or transfer fees. 
It is not uncommon for a firearms enthusiast to purchase firearms at gun shows or gun
shops away from their home town, especially for those of us who live in sparsely 
populated areas. If LD 60 were to pass, an individual who legally purchased a firearm 
at a gun shop while on business or a family trip out of town would either have to pay 
shipping and a transfer fee to have their firearm shipped to their nearest dealer, make 
another trip out of town to the location of purchase to pick up their firearm, or hang 
around the town where they purchased the firearm until their waiting period ended. 
All 3 of these options are unnecessary, ridiculous, and nothing but an onerous burden 
placed on decent Mainers.
There is no proof that waiting periods prevent violent crime.
LD 60 ought not to pass!
Thank you, 
Richard Smith
