Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the Criminal Justice 
and Public Safety Committee. l am Margo Donnis from South Portland. 
We often hear people say - ‘Guns don’t kill people, criminals kill people.’ Or ‘Guns don’t kill 
people, mentally troubled people kill people.’ 
Given this, can we do more to prevent criminals or mentally troubled people from getting guns’? 
Yes we can. Yes we must. 
Firearm buyers know about Maine’s lax background checks. They are coming here from New 
York (where my niece and her fiancé live) and Pennsylvania (where my nephew and niece and 
their spouses live) and Massachusetts (where my two sisters and their families live). After 
buying firearms privately with no background checks, they are taking the firean'ns back home 
and selling them privately. And, any of those guns may threaten my relatives in those states. 
As to my friends and my neighbors? 
My friend is married to a policeman. A criminal - via a private firearm sale - can get a firearm 
and threaten him. 
My neighborhood elementary school may be threatened by a mentally troubled individual with 
a firearm. 
l dread getting a call from a family member or a friend who have lost a spouse or child or 
grandchild to a disturbed individual who bought a gun in a Maine private sale. l fear reading the 
local news every day, as l may hear that a Maine school shooting has occurred. 
Mainers have lax firearm background checks in our laws. We must shut the door to this 
loophole that is giving criminals and disturbed individuals access to firearms. 
l’m lucky today. Tonight I can sleep because my family and friends and neighbors are whole. 
l worry that this can be shattered in one moment of unspeakable madness for which I know 
Maine lax gun laws are partly to blame. 
Please. Support this law. Our families and friends and neighbors have a right to life. We rely on 
you to protect us from violence.
