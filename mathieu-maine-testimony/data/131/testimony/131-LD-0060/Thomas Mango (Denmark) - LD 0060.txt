LD 60
I strongly oppose  LD60 as it is completely unconstitutional. It has been proven time 
and again that a waiting period does not deter crime, and no law will stop a 
determined criminal from commiting a crime. Furthermore, in the defense of self 
defense, which is a constitutionally protected right, LD60 would prohibit a person 
from being able to protect themselves for days. I can think of no greater horror than 
being a victim of domestic violence and being told "sorry, you can't protect yourself 
for 3 more days."
