RE: Testimony in opposition to LD 60, An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period 
After the Sale of a Firearm.
An unintended consequence of this bill is to make the innocent a victim of violence 
by preventing them of their most basic right that of self-protection. Often, we read 
about a woman with a protective order who has attempted to purchase a firearm and 
who is killed or attacked during a mandatory waiting period. The likelihood of this 
bill saving any lives is vanishingly small. The likelihood of a truly vulnerable person 
being denied their constitutional right to protect themselves is a certainty.  If this bill 
costs even one woman their life those who enacted, it are responsible.  This bill 
should not pass.
Respectfully,
Joseph Grant, Wiscasset
