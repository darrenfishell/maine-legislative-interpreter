Heather  Sprague
Cushing
LD 60
Dear distinguished members of the committee, Representative Salisbury and Senator 
Beebe-Center, 
My name is Heather Sprague I live in Cushing and was born in Maine.
I write today in opposition to bill LD60 an act to require a 72hr waiting period after 
the sale of a firearm. I ask that you oppose this bill because it infringes on our second 
amendment right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government that seeks to 
control the people against their will. I am very concerned that we the people will be 
left defenseless against such a government. We already have strict gun laws and I 
remind the members that criminals do not follow nor care about gun laws. I ask that 
you vote ought not pass and stop infringing on our God given rights.
Thank you for your time.
