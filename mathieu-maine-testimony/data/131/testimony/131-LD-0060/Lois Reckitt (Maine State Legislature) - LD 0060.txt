Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, Members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee 
My name is Lois Galgay Reckitt and l represent District 122, the ocean end of South Portland. 
I am here today to speak in support of LD 69- An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale 
of a Handgun. 
This bill, l truly believe, is a small step forward to decrease the numbers of suicides in Maine every year 
Like most people, who are motivated to speak on this issue today, I cannot give you the data for how 
many suicides have occurred in Maine in any recent time period — nor can I accurately articulate how 
many of those happened with a gun. 
However, like many of those who will speak or write in favor of this initiative today, l will tell you why it 
matters so much to me personally. In the last few years, my wife and I have lost two close family 
members to suicides with guns. We have watched the pain and suffering of those remaining — and 
grieve with them as well as for the lives lost. 
For us — and those like us all over Maine — I implore you to vote Ought To Pass on LD 60.
