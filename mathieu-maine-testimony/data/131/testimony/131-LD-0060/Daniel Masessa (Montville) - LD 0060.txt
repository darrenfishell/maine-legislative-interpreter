LD 60
I oppose LD 60, An Act to Require a 72-hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a 
Firearm. This bill restricts the rights of law biding citizens. It will do more harm than 
good if a person needs a firearm to protect themselves in an abusive situation. Law 
abiding citizens should not have to wait to exercise their Constitutional right to bear 
arms. This bill must not become law.
