LD 60
Dear Committee Members,
I strongly oppose this Act being proposed and ask you not to go forward with LD 60. 
When a person fills out the Form 4473 and submits themselves to a background 
check, upon approval they should be allowed to obtain their firearm and go home that 
day with it. They should not be punished and have to wait 72 hours to take possession
of a firearm that they have successfully passed the background check. 
I ask you to oppose this Act and stick to the Maine Constitution in regard to the 
Maine 2nd Amendment.
Sincerely, 
Simon Cavilla
