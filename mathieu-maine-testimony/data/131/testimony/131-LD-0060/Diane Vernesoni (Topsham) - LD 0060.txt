LD 60
Dear Senator Beebe, Rep Salisbury and members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety committee,
My name is Diane Vernesoni, and I live in Topsham.
I would like you to vote against LD 60, An Act to Require 72 hours Waiting Period 
After the Sale of a Firearm.
Sometimes people need help immediately.  If a woman or a man is being threatened 
with harm, they need help sooner, rather than later.  There are too many stories of 
women who could have been saved if they had only had a gun.  They have an abusive 
partner who would rather see them dead than with anyone else or even free from 
them.  They should be able to get a gun for their protection before it is too late for 
them.  The Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights in our Constitution gives us the 
right to “bear arms.”  This is a right or power listed in the Constitution of the United 
States.  There is no time limit involved.  Under the 10th Amendment, no power stated 
in the Constitution can be altered or taken away by a state.  The Legislature of the 
State of Maine cannot and should not pass this bill.
Thank you for your consideration.
