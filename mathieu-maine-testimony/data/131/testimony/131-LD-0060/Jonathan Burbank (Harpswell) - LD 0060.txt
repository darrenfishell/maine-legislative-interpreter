LD 60
Good public policies are based on facts and data and historical evidence, and effective
laws are written when lawmakers understand the effects of such laws on a range of 
outcomes and can weigh the inherent trade-offs. 
I OPPOSE LD 60, there is not a shred of evidence to support it having a general 
public safety benefit and you will be getting a class of people potentially hurt and 
killed for no possible benefit. 
I’m guessing you have never been subjected to someone harassing and threatening 
you and your kids or know someone who has. If you have you would never propose 
such a waiting period or vote for this bill.  But if you have not you need to understand
that the one thing that works when you are being stalked and harassed is to arm 
yourself and learn the basics of personal self defense.  Court orders, moving to a new 
location on a regular basis and even police security at work simply do NOT get the 
job done based on the brave women I have helped learn to shoot handguns effectively 
enough for personal self defense. The one common item in these situations was that 
the participant did not own a handgun initially.  And NEEDED ONE RIGHT NOW. 
And a 72 hour waiting period would substantially increase their risks. This is a law 
that won’t mean anything except if you actually need a gun to defend yourself and 
you don’t have one.
