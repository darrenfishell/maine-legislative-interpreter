131 Maine Legislature 
LD 60 An Act to Require a 72-Hour Waiting Period After the Sale of a Firearm 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Criminal Justice And Public Safety Committee, I'm here to testify in 
opposition to LD 60. The only purpose of this bill is to make gun ownership in the state of Maine 
inconvenient and even more legally precarious. There is nothing to be gained. Particularly when 
considering that, according to the racist Maine Gun Safety Coalition that supports this bill, at least half 
of Maine homes already have a Ô¨Årearm. l ask you: what am l waiting for if I already have a gun on my 
person when I make an agreement to purchase a firearm? Every citizen of this country has the right of 
presumed innocence. There have also been situations in my life where I had to give or loan a firearm to 
a friend in a dangerous situation without the luxury of them waiting half a week. There are a number of 
anecdotes of women being killed while waiting for a permit to be cleared. A right delayed is a right 
denied. 
As someone who has suffered from depression in the past, l don't want to hear any nonsense from this 
bill's sponsors or supporters about this preventing suicides. Again, chances are that those people 
already own a gun. Nobody who supports this actually cares about me or any of their constituents, as 
evidenced by the fact that it would levy hefty fines on us in a brutal economic climate. If you want to 
address Maine's high suicide rate, make it a less hopeless and depressing place to live. Don't question 
my right to possess a firearm in a state where this right is explicitly unquestionable. 
I urge you to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS. However, if you refuse to listen to your constituents as 
you often do, I'm not going to be playing your game. I will not be complicit in denying people their right 
to be armed.
