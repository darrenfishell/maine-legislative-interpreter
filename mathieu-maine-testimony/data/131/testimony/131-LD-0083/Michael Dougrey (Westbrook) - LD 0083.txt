LD 83
My name is Michael and I have owned and operated a medical cannabis business in 
Maine for almost 6 years.
The issue I would like to provide my personal thoughts and testimony on for LD83.
I think it is difficult to call something a "tobacco product" if it does not contain 
tobacco. However, I do understand the concern if the current tobacco retail licenses 
are granted to home addresses that can open up a pandoras box by allowing the sale of
tobacco products out of residences.
Is it possible to find a middle ground by creating a license/online registration that 
allows medical caregivers the ability to sell ONLY hemp prerolls and ONLY vapes 
that strictly contain cannabis?  If so, there would need to be very severe fines or 
revocation of caregiver license if not in compliance? 
Thank you for your time.
Very Truly Yours, 
Michael Dougrey
