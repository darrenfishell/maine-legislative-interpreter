LD 83
I support Sen Craig Hickman's bill, LD 83, which clarifies that cannabis and cannabis 
paraphernalia are not tobacco and may not be regulated as such. 
I want to echo the messages that Sen Craig Hickman stated in his November 1, 2022 
letter to Policy Director Gabrielle Bérubé Pierce, Esq.
And, I want to reiterate that... "cannabis patients are authorized, without exception, to 
possess and use paraphernalia for growing, producing, and consuming cannabis for 
medical use. Caregiver businesses are supported by revenues obtained from providing
the necessary paraphernalia, without exception, needed to grow, produce, and 
consume cannabis for medical use." 
Yes to LD 83; it is absolutely a necessary bill!
