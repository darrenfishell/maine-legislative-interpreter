In support of LD83 An Act to Clarify State Policy Regarding the Use of Cannabis 
Paraphernalia in the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act
To the members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, 
We are medical cannabis caregivers who are proud to be a part of Maines Medical Cannabis 
Program. We would like to express our deep gratitude to Senator Hickman for introducing 
this bill, and voice to the entire committee, our strong support of LD 83, which clarifies the 
right of Maine Medical Cannabis Caregivers to produce and provide effective and 
appropriate medicine to their patients, as well as the tools needed to consume it. 
Those not well acquainted with cannabis may think that smoking or vaping is antithetical 
to consuming medicine, but it is important to understand that different methods of delivery 
create very different effects in the body. Consuming through smoking or vaping brings the 
most rapid onset and does not require involvement of the digestive system. Edibles and 
tinctures have a much slower onset and different medicinal effect that is not ideal for every 
patient. We will not detail all the variables here, but simply want there to be an 
understanding that all patients, of all ages, need access to methods for smoking and vaping 
cannabis to ensure their full access to the benefits of this medicine.  
Sincerely,
Geoffrey Nosach and Elizabeth Hayes of Mercer Maine.
