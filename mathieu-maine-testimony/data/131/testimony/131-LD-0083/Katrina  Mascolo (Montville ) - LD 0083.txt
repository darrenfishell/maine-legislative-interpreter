I am a caregiver running a small medical cannabis business.  I am female owned and certified
by MOFGA.  Prerolls are my primary product that I provide.  To have them deemed a tobacco
product overnight, during harvest shook my entire livelihood.  I have invested so much this 
year to be able to focus on providing a clean and eco friendly product and have developed a 
loyal following.  
Senator Hickman has so many valid points.  OCP agreed that no changes would be made 
unless Legislature took action to change it. And the difference in definitions between the 
consumption of a tobacco product and cannabis paraphernalia.  As well as the fact that the 
same product is taxed differently if it is sold for the purpose of consuming medical cannabis.  
And that in no statue is a cigarette defined as a pre-roll.
