Senate President Troy Jackson, Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, 
Senator Craig Hickman and other distinguished members of the 
commitee of Veteran and Legal Affairs. l am speaking today in 
support of LD83. 
My Name is Andelena Henderson I am a medical cannabis patient, 
Founder of West Paris Provisions, a woman business owner, and 
Navy Veteran. l am on the Planning Board for the town of West 
Paris, as well as a 13 year volunteer for Maine Adaptive ’s Veterans 
No Boundaries. In fact, this past weekend We had Veterans No 
Boundaries up at Sunday River and West Paris Provisions with 
their sales round up program raised $8,000 dollars for the 
Veterans No Boundaries Program. We would not have been able 
to accomplish this if this poor guidance. Vape carts and Pre—rolls 
are a HUGE part of the sales in dispensaries. 
0 this will hurt the dispensary, hurt my income, hurt my patients, 
and hurt the employees. vapes and prerolls are the biggest 
part of the business as they are the most common methods of 
taking medicine as they are the fastest acting way of taking 
medicine. 
0 PTSD: vape carts and smoking is the fastest way to deliver 
medicine into someone to calm them and help manage ptsd 
and anxiety symptoms as well as pain relief. Personal 
story/connection to PTSD as a Veteran. 
0 This doesnt make sense. people are not buying cannabis 
paraphenilia for tobacco. theyre buying it for medication. 
almost all of the patients at west paris provisions truly need it 
as a medication. 
0 It is far safer then any other medication out there. there is no 
known deaths on cannabis. pharmacuticals are far more 
dangerous. these bills are simply an attack on medical 
cannabis. 
0 We have got to change these laws and protect the medical 
cannabis program. 
Thank you for your time.
