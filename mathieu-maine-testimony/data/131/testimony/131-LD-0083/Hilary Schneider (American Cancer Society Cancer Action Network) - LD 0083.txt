Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director, 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network g 
In Opposition to LD 83 "An Act to Clarify State Policy Regarding the Use of Cannabis Paraphernalia in the 
Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act" 
January 25, 2023' 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. My name 
is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the Atlantic/North Region for the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN). in this role, I serve as the lead Government 
Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer‘ 
Society, supports evidence-based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health 
problem. As the nation's leading advocate for public policies that are helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures 
that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public policy matters at all levels of 
government. A A 
l would like to thank you for this opportunity to submit the following testimony in opposition to LD 83. WeV 
would like to start by acknowledging areas in which we all can likely agree and the desire of our organization to~ 
work with the sponsors of this bill to find a mutually acceptable approach to address their concerns with the 
current law. With 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women expected to be diagnosed with cancer in-their lifetime, ‘ it is likely 
that most, if not everyone, on this committee has been touched by cancer. We all likely know someone with 
cancer who has suffered from side effects during treatment that are inadequately addressed, lowering their 
quality of life-and complicating their ability to fight the disease. ACS CAN recognizes that cannabis, including 
non-prescription derivatives and extracts, as well as FDA-approved cannabinoid drugs, have been used by some 
to treat pain, nausea, vomiting, and other side effects. We support the need for more scientific research on 
cannabinoids for cancer patients and recognizes the need for better and more effective therapies that can 
overcome the often-debilitating side effects of cancer and its treatment." We also support research to better 
examine the impact of changes in cannabis policy and usage patterns on population health, including tobacco 
use and cancer. ' f '' 
With an estimated 10,490 Mainersm who will hear the words ”you have cancer" this year alone and with cancer 
remaining the #1 killer of Maine people, we all can likely agree that more needs to be done to end cancer as we 
know it, for everyone. This not only includes reducing incidence and mortality but also reducing the negative 
impacts of the side effects caused by cancer and its treatment. With lung cancer being the leading cause of 
cancer death for men and women in Maine and the US, we all likely agree that preventing and reducing death 
from lung cancer is critical to ending cancer as we know it. With tobacco use remaining the leading preventable 
risk factor for lung cancer, our organization believesit is imperative that we take steps to prevent our children 
from ever using tobacco products and, as part of that effort, does not support any actions that would roll back 
effective tobacco control laws. -

When deliberating on this bill and with these goals in mind, it is important to recognize that while sections 2-5 
make changes to the section of statute that governs the medical marijuana program, section 1 makes changes to 
the section of statute that governs retail sales of tobacco products, which includes provisions that are intended 
to prevent and reduce underage sales of tobacco products. Restricting underage sales of tobacco products is an 
important component of preventing and reducing tobacco use as nearly all (95%) adults who smoke started 
smoking by age 21. The definition of tobacco products that is amended in section 1 of this bill was drafted 
carefully and deliberatively, based on model language supported by leading national public health organizations, 
including ACS CAN. This definition was part of the law passed in 2017 to raise the minimum sales age of tobacco 
products from 18 to 21. The bill (sponsored by former Senator Paul Davis with bipartisan cosponsorship) passed 
into law with overwhelming bipartisan support of more than 2/3 of the legislature. On December 19, 2019, 
President Trump signed legislation passed by Congress, which made this minimum sales age increase the law of 
the land nationally. The federal law became effective immediately, and it is now illegal for a retailer to sell any 
tobacco product—-including cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes —to anyone under 21. The federal minimum age 
of sale applies to all retail establishments and persons with no exceptions. 
Under Maine law, the tobacco products definition includes electronic smoking devices, pipes, and rolling papers. 
lt is important that the tobacco product definition includes these products as it is impossible to determine if 
nicotine or tobacco is present in these products without testing them. All retailers who sell tobacco products 
must be licensed as tobacco retailers. As such, since 2017, Maine's laws have required any adult use marijuana 
retailer and medical marijuana dispensary that sells these products to be also licensed as a tobacco retailer and 
in compliance with tobacco product retail sales laws. 
It's important to note that the overlap in definitions that results in a medical marijuana dispensary selling 
”tobacco products" are products that are used to smoke or aerosolize marijuana. ACS CAN opposes the smoking 
or aerosolization, including vaporization, of marijuana and other cannabinoids in public places because the 
carcinogens in marijuana smoke pose numerous health hazards to the person using the product and others in 
the person's presence. According to the US CDC, ”smoked marijuana delivers THC and other cannabinoids to the 
body, but it also delivers harmful substances, including many of the same toxins and carcinogens (cancer- 
causing chemicals) found in tobacco smoke, which are harmful to the lungs and cardiovascular system/"" 
Secondhand marijuana smoke contains many of the same cancer-causing and toxic chemicals as secondhand 
tobacco smoke, including mercury, ammonia, cyanide, lead & formaldehyde, and contain hazardous fine 
particles that pose a significant health risk to non~smokers." 
In addition to cannabis products that closely resemble tobacco products, there are products on the market that 
contain nicotine and cannabis. On the next page, there is a photo of such a product from an industry trade 
magazine. According to enforcement experts, ground marijuana can resemble tobacco and it can be difficult to 
distinguish whether or not a product contains cannabis or tobacco by sight alone. Some products, like certain 
electronic smoking devices, are used for-consumption of both nicotine/tobacco and cannabis. Many of the 
tobacco industry's largest companies, like Altria, have made investments in the cannabis industry in recent 
years.“ Concurrent, or dual use, of tobacco products and cannabis is a growing concern among the public health 
community, especially when examining the patterns of use among youth and young people, and the challenges 
dual use poses when individuals are trying to quit tobacco use."“ For these reasons, our organization believes it is 
important to carefully consider unintended consequences of the changes proposed in this bill including the 
potential for increases in youth access to tobacco products and increased exposure to cannabis smoke. We do 
not believe it is the intent of the sponsors of the bill to inadvertently create loopholes for the tobacco industry

to manipulate to their advantage. As such, we recommend that this committee seriously examine the state's 
capacity to ensure compliance of the laws by regulated entities and develop ways to examine changes to laws 
and any possible unintended consequences through data collection, monitoring and assessment. 
Given the concerns cited above, ACS CAN makes the following recommendations; _ 
0 Avoid making changes to definitions of tobacco products in statute. Instead of making changes to 
statutes that govern tobacco control, including the laws that govern tobacco product retail sales, make 
changes that exempt medical marijuana entities from the "tobacco 21 law" so long as language is added 
to statute that explicitly prohibits such entities from selling products containing nicotine or tobacco, 
including synthetic nicotine or tobacco, or products intended for tobacco or nicotine consumption. 
0 The "cannabis paraphernalia" definition proposed in this bill is very broad and could include products 
that are used for the consumption or ingestion of tobacco/nicotine. We believe that the above bullet 
addresses this but want to be explicit in this concern to ensure loopholes are not inadvertently created 
and used to increase access to/sales of tobacco products, especially among those under age 21. 
I Ensure there is adequate capacity among state entities (e.g., Office of Cannabis Policy, ME CDC, AG’s 
Office, etc.) to ensure compliance with the law and ensure that medical marijuana entities are not 
selling tobacco or nicotine products. 
Q Ensure that data is being collected and reported back to the committee that examines trends in youth 
access and use of tobacco and cannabis (including ways in which products are being consumed), 
compliance data, dual use of tobacco and cannabis. it is important that this data collection and 
monitoring include metrics that allow for the assessment of health equity impacts. 
We appreciate your time and consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about 
this testimony.
