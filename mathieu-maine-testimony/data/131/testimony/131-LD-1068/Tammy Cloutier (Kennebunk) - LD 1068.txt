LD 1068
As a Maine constituent, I ask for your support for LD 1068 An Act to Ban the Hunting of 
Animals in Enclosed Areas. For those not familiar with this activity, canned hunting offers 
individuals a guaranteed kill of non-native animals; primarily for the benefit of trophy hunters. 
Species such as domestically raised red deer, bison, and wild boar are contained within an 
area with no chance of escape. Hunting may be a tradition in Maine; however, this type of 
hunting does not include fair chase and is considered unethical by many hunters and hunting 
groups. 
Why canned hunting should be banned in Maine:
  There are only six canned hunting facilities in Maine; a decrease from the 11 that previously
existed.
  These facilities are not subject to wildlife laws.
  Although sometimes noted as a property rights issue, historic precedent and recent case 
law refute this argument.
  Canned hunting began as a controversial practice in the 1990s in Maine and that continues 
to be the case. It is not the primary source of income for these operations, and there are 
viable alternatives to this type of business.
  The proposed legislation provides a two-year phase out period, allowing for planning and 
mitigation of any financial loss.
  20 states have taken action against canned hunting. Maine should follow suit.
  18 states with canned hunting have documented chronic wasting disease, which can be 
deadly to Maine deer species. 
  This is not an anti-hunting bill. It is meant to take a moral stand against a specific unethical 
activity.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
