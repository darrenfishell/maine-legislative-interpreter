Dear Committee Members,
We are writing in support of LD. 1068.
Fair Chase, a phrase first attributed to Theodore Roosevelt, is the ethical, sportsmanlike pursuit 
of free-ranging game. Canned hunting, on the other hand, is quite the opposite and is very 
objectionable even to many of Maine’s hunters. It is also important to consider that canned 
hunting is illegal in many states including Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, and Wyoming that are 
ranked highly as best places for hunting.
Apart from the ethics of this practice, it is also important to consider that there has been a lot of 
documentation of chronic wasting disease in animals bred for canned hunts. 
This puts our native wildlife in jeopardy when a sick animal escapes from its enclosure. 
Lastly, supporting LD. 1068 is not the slippery path to gun control nor to the end of hunting as 
some would have you believe. 
Sincerely,
Jim and Lega Medcalf
