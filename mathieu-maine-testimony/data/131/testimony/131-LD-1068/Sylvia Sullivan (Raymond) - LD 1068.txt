LD 1068
I am writing in support of LD# 1068, An  Act to Ban the Killing of Animals in an Enclosed 
Area".    Simply put, canned hunting can in no way (to my mind) be considered a "sport" or 
"sportsmanlike".   And after speaking with deer hunters in Maine, it apparently carries a 
danger of bringing chronic-wasting disease to our Maine soil.   Please support this bill for the 
people, animals, and state of Maine.
Thank you.
