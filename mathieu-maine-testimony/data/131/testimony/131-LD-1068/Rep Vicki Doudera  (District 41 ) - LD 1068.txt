Conservation
and
For estry
Good
afternoon
Senator
Ingwerson,
Representative
Pluecker
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint 
Standing
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry .
My
name
is
V icki
Doudera
and 
I
represent
House
District
41,
which
includes
Camden
and
Rockport.
I
am
here
before
you
today 
to
speak
in
support
of
LD
1068,
An
Act
to
Ban
the
Hunting
of
Animals
in
Enclosed
Ar eas.
I
have
reached
out
to
Mainers
around
the
state
–
hunters
in
particular
–
and
I
have
yet
to
find
someone
who
supports
the
idea
of
this
inhumane
practice
taking
place
in
our
state.
That’ s
because
they
find
it
unfair
and
even
barbaric.
Non-native
animals,
raised
in
captivity
to
be
shot
at
by
inexperienced
hunters
in
an
enclosed
area
–
??
This
is
not
the
kind
of
hunting
in
which
our
friends
and
neighbors
participate.
It’ s
not
the
kind
of
hunting
that
my
father ,
nor
my
grandfather ,
nor
countless
uncles
or
cousins
have
done
come
fall.
It’ s
not
something
that
anyone
takes
a
hunter
safety
course
for ,
because
it
is
not
a
part
of
Maine’ s
proud
hunting
tradition.
It
is
an
unethical
outlier
in
a
state
that
values
a
fair
hunt.
The
kill
on
these
“ranches”
can
be
unnecessarily
inhumane.
T rue
hunters
take
pride
in
the
chase
and
the
skill
to
drop
an
animal
with
one
clean
shot.
People
who
participate
in
these
staged
hunts
are
often
inexperienced,
increasing
the
unlikelihood
of
a
clean
kill.
In
many
cases
the
animals
are
repeatedly
body
wounded
with
bullets
or
arrows,
bleeding
out
in
pain,
either
by
inaccuracy
and/or
because
the
shooter
does
not
want
to
damage
the
‘trophy’
head.
Maine
Inland
Fisheries
and
W ildlife
professionals
contend
that
the
non-native
animals
are
captive.
Thus,
instead
of
being
a
wild
species,
the
animals
should
be
regarded
as
domestic
—
like
cattle
—
and
therefore
this
practice
is
administered,
licensed
and
inspected
by
the
Agriculture
Department.
That
is
why
we
are
here
before
you
today .
The
Department
receives
very
minor
revenue
in
licensing
and
tag
fees,
and
you
can
get
the
specifics
directly
from
them,
but
I
would
ar gue
that
this
does
not
seem
to
be
part
of
the
Department
of
Agriculture’ s
mission.
Particularly
not
when
this
Department
has
such
a
great
focus
on
Animal
W elfare.

Finally ,
I
want
to
talk
about
property
rights.
Don’ t
people
have
a
right
to
do
what
they
want
on
their
own
land?
Historic
precedent
and
recent
case
law
refute
that
this
is
a
property
rights
issue.
Property
owners
have
multiple
alternatives
for
their
land
that
are
far
more
acceptable
to
societal
norms.
There
is
a
reason
why
dog
fighting
and
cock
fighting
are
banned
in
Maine.
That
reason
is
because
they
are
unethical,
inhumane
practices.
The
same
is
true
for
canned
trophy
hunts.
I
ask
you
to
support
this
measure
and
end
a
practice
which
has
been
mired
in
controversy
since
it
started
and
which
so
many
Mainers
find
abhorrent.
Thank
you.
Respectfully ,
Rep.
