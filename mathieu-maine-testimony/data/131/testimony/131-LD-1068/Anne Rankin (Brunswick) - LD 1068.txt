LD 1068
Good morning, Sen. Ingwersen, Rep. Pluecker, and Members of the Committee on 
Agriculture Conservation and Forestry. I would like to testify my very strong support for L.E. 
1068 and ban the hunting of animals in enclosed areas. Killing animals in this manner is 
inhumane. Many of the individuals who come to these canned hunt ventures are 
inexperienced as hunters, requiring several shots. The animal struggles in terrible pain before
the animal dies. Many experienced hunters see the practice of canned hunts as inhumane 
and unsportsmanlike as well. We need to do better as a society, to strive for the ethical and 
compassionate standards for how we treat animals--and because animals have no voice. I 
urge you to please pass L.E. 1068. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Anne Rankin
