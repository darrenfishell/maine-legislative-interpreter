Testimony Neither for Nor Against L.D. 1068-An Act to Ban the Hunting of Animals in Enclosed 
Areas

My name is John M. Glowa, Sr.  I live in China, Maine.  While I fully support the intent of this 
bill, to end canned killing, I believe that the bill has several flaws that need to be corrected.
First, killing in enclosed areas has nothing to do with hunting.  Hunting is overseen by the Joint 
Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.  The proposed section 11229 titled 
“Hunting in an enclosed area” is misnamed and misleading. If it is retained in the bill, it should 
be labeled “Killing in an enclosed area.” 
My interpretation of paragraph 1 in this section is that it prohibits the killing or injuring of any 
animal that it is in captivity.  Clearly, this is not its intent.  This paragraph does not define 
either firearm or deadly weapon.  A hypodermic needle used to euthanize an animal is a 
deadly weapon.    A hatchet or knife when used to dispatch poultry is a deadly weapon.
To make this unambiguous and not subject to interpretation, my recommendation is that the 
bill simply sunset Title 7, Chapter 202-A, the law that permits the operation of commercial 
large game shooting areas.
Thank you.
