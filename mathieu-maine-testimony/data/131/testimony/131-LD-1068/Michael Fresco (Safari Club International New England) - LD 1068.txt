Good Mor ning, My name Is Michael Fresco  and I am  the New England Chapter 
President of Safari Club International. For those  who are not familiar with SCI, We 
are the wor ld lea der in Wildlife conservation and hunter a dvocacy.  Today I would 
like to express my opinion why I believe that High  fenced hunting ranches are a 
benefit  to not only Maine s economy but al so to its residen ts. For one, High  fence  
ranche s give the o pportunity  to hunt to many of those who may not be able to do 
it elsewhere. Being in a controlled environment, these ranches allow handicap  or 
less mobil e hunters get into the  woods. They also give an organization like m ine to 
use th ese ranch es as a tool teach chi ldren and new commers how to hunt and  its 
benefits. Just this past December , my organization took 6 underprivileged  youths 
to a high  fence  ranch here in Maine . These kids took t o the woods and harvested 
animals for the  first time . We then  proceeded to pro cess the animals and donat e 
the meat to a  veterans org anization.  
Another  benefit  to high  fenced ranch es to the people of Maine  is th at it helps 
minimalize the i mpac t of the growing popularity  of bi g game hunting. Since co vid 
the hunting  industry has exploded , millions of Americans  have seen the benefi t 
and necessity to learn how to harvest and procure their own foo d. These ranches 
help mitigate  the amount of people in the woods. Thus,  allowing more acre s and 
game  for them to utilize .  
 
Lastly, the economic  impact  that these ranches have on the local  economies are 
wide ranging . The jobs these ranch es help provid e for Maine  residents go  much 
further  than the employe es inside of its fen ces. From Hay and grai n from local 
farms, to hote l rooms, fu el and groceries in the local communities , these hunters 
who travel from all o ver the world  to spend money and put back  into Maine â€™s 
economy.  
Thank you
