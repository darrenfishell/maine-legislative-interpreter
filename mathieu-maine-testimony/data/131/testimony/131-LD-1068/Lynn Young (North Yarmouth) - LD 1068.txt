LD 1068
LD 1068 is quite simply, a bill that takes a moral stand on a particular type of activity,
which the vast majority of the public AND hunters oppose. Proponents of this 
legislation are against egregious forms of animal abuse. Captive hunting falls into that
category.   
Captive hunting is not hunting, and is an embarrassment to the state of Maine.
