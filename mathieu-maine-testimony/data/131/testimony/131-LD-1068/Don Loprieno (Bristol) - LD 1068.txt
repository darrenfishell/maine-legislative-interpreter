Chairs of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee
Gentlemen and Members of the Committee:
Imagine that in your town or city, there was a local zoo with all kinds of animals in cages, 
unable to get away, and you were allowed for a fee to shoot these animals.   You would 
probably wonder what ever happened to sportsmanship.  After all, the animals can’t hide or 
escape; their evasive skills are probably rusty from being confined and in any case wouldn’t 
do much good here because they can’t elude their pursuers for long and have virtually no 
chance to survive.    You might also think this is a shooting-gallery version of legalized animal
cruelty, and you’d be right.
That’s what canned hunting is all about.  It’s a stain on Maine’s reputation for fair play and the
tradition of a level playing field when it comes to how we treat our wildlife.  It’s time to remove 
that stain by voting for LD 1068.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Don Loprieno
