LD 1068
Greetings Senator Igwersen, Representative Pluecker and members of the Committee 
on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.  I am writing in support of LD #1068 (An 
Act to Ban the Killing of Animals in Enclosed Areas).  My only comment would be 
why would any human kill an innocent animal that was trapped in an “enclosed 
area”?  To what end?  Amusement?  Very very sick - even more pathetic that we 
would have to ban such a thing.  Shame on the human race.
