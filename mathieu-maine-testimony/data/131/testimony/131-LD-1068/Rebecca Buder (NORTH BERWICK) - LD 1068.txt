Please stop this small and dying “industry”.
Canned hunting only began in Maine in the 1990s, and was (rightfully) a controversial issue in
the legislature in 1999, 2003 and 2009. Owners have multiple opportunities to create a more 
acceptable/profitable business model, including moving more into more non-consumptive 
activities as mentioned above, which many already provide, and at minimum, are capable of 
doing so. Hindsite Hunt Preserve that in 2016 closed the hunting ranch due to lack of 
interest/low revenue and converted the property into a profitable medical marijuana business. 
At the very least, this bill creates an opportunity for new, and more profitable, revenue 
streams. This is not a property rights issue. The owners have many alternatives/opportunities 
for their land that are much more acceptable. This killing can be extremely inhumane. These 
“hunters” are often unskilled, with little chance of a clean kill. In many cases the animals are 
repeatedly wounded with bullets/arrows, bleeding out in extreme pain, either by inaccuracy 
and/or the shooter does not want to damage the ‘trophy’ head (sickening, but true). This is 
seen by hunters and non-hunters alike as unnecessarily inhumane and a bloodsport that has 
no place in our state. Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife professionals contend that the 
non-native animals are captive.  In addition to this, more than 17 states with current hunting 
ranches have documented chronic wasting disease. This can be, and is, deadly to Maine 
native deer species. This is not something to be actively working towards. The vast majority 
of the public AS WELL AS hunters oppose this inhumane, cruel, unnecessary and idiotic 
activity. There are multiple ways to engage in outdoor activities in this state outside of captive 
hunting. Those who are against this bill, hunters and the greater public alike, are against 
captive hunting because it is an egregious forms of animal abuse.
