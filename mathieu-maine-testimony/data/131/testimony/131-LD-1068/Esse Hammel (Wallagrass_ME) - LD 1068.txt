Good Afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Mooney and all Committee 
members;
I am not going to talk about the usual problems with hunts that guarantee
success but about the psychologically troubling idea that this is a sport.
Sport is about skill and chance not cheating with an unfair advantage.
Skill is not necessary when the prey has no chance to win.  Where is the sport in waiting for 
an animal conditioned to safely find food or water in a place where people with expensive 
equipment wait to slaughter them?
I find it profoundly sad and shameful.
Respectfully yours,
Esse Hammel
