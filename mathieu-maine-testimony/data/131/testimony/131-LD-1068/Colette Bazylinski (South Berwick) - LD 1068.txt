LD 1068
I am writing to express my support for LD 1068, An Act to Ban the Hunting of 
Animals in Enclosed Areas. I was surprised to learn that canned hunting is currently 
allowed in Maine and that such hunting facilities are not subject to wildlife laws. It is 
not "sporting" and is unnecessarily cruel to the animals who are killed. Please pass 
LD 1068 and end the inhumane practice of canned hunting.
