Martha Macdonald 
In support of LD #679 "An act regarding animals in enclosed areas"
'Committee on judiciary and March 23, 2023'
Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen & members of the committee on 
judiciary, my name is Martha Macdonald from Waterford, Maine. Thank you for considering 
passing this act in favor of banning canned hunting in Maine. I feel that this practice is cruel &
inhumane for these captive animals & damaging to the existing native wildlife. The captive 
animals are often shot many times by inexperienced hunters which leads to their needless 
suffering. It is unnecessarily cruel. I do not believe this practice has any place in a decent, 
caring society. Thank you again for your consideration.
