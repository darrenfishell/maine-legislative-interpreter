businesses throughout the State and employ thousands of people. 
0 We support the Resolve of LD 1678 
0 Our Product, Living Plants, Produces Oxygen and Sequesters Carbon 
0 There has been lots of research over the decades of beneﬁts of Trees and 
other Plants in the Urban/Suburban space not the least of is Carbon 
Sequestration. Even the typical lawn has a positive effect. 
Finally, we feel that urban/suburban spaces should be included by name in the 
resolves study as opposed to just the clause ”inc|uding but not limited to”. 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.
