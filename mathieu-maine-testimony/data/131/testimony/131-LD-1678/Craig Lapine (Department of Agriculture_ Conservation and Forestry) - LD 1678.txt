IN SUPPORT OF LD 1678 
Resolve, Directing the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Study and Report on 
Soil Carbon Sequestration Incentive Programs 
April 26, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Craig Lapine, and I am the Director of the Bureau 
of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (DACF) in support of LD 1678, Resolve, Directing the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to Study and Report on Soil Carbon Sequestration Incentive 
Programs. 
Members of this Committee, including the sponsors and cosponsors of this bill, have shown 
remarkable leadership with respect to the issue of enhancing the health of Maine soils. We recognize 
that on this Committee, there is deep insight into and appreciation for the economic and ecological 
importance of soil health and the special roles that farmers and foresters have in stewarding, and 
beneﬁtting from, that health. We are grateful that the Legislature approved funding for the Maine 
Healthy Soils Program, and we are excited about the Work underway to implement the program that 
will carry out this important work. 
The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, submitted a report 
on soil carbon incentives to this Committee in September 2022. That report summarized the current 
scientific literature on soil carbon sequestration in northern climates and suggested various 
programmatic activities the State could undertake to enhance soil carbon management. Protection of 
coastal and inland wetlands, forests, and prime farmland is essential to maintain soil carbon, and all 
four bureaus of the Department are working towards this goal. 
The current Resolve would focus specifically on soil carbon incentives as a mechanism and is, in 
essence, a subset of work already in progress in the Department. In order to shape our Healthy Soils

Program, our staff have been collaborating with our federal agency partners and investigating 
successful soil health promotion strategies developed by other individual states and nations. The 
federal government is making signiﬁcant investments in natural resource programs that will beneﬁt 
soil health and carbon sequestration. These programs are evolving rapidly, and we will need to be agile 
in responding and collaborating to take advantage of these unprecedented opportunities. 
You will see that work reﬂected in our Healthy Soils Program design over this summer and in 
conjunction with federal investments in healthy soils, which will roll out at the begimiing of the federal 
ﬁscal year in October. Given this timing, we suggest that this bill be carried over to the next session. 
Thank you for considering this infonnation. I am happy to answer questions now or at a Work session.
