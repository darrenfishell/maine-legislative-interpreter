LD 88
Testimony in Support of An Act to Pr ovide Qualifying Municipalities a Per centage of
Adult Use Cannabis Sales and Excise Tax Revenues
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on
Taxation:
I join you today to testify on behalf of the City of Portland’ s Legislative/Nominating
Committee in support of LD 88, An Act to Provide Qualifying Municipalities a Percentage of
Adult Use Cannabis Sales and Excise Tax Revenues.
LD 88 would provide additional revenue to municipalities that are allowing and managing
cannabis businesses in their communities. In the “Adult Use Program” 2021 Annual Report
provided to the Maine State Legislature, there was $12,362,620 in excise and sales tax revenue
to the State of Maine. This revenue would not have been obtained without the support of
municipalities, like the City of Portland, that allow cannabis businesses in their community .
According to the Maine Of fice of Cannabis Policy , there are currently 203 adult use cannabis
retail stores in operation. Thirty (30) of those stores are located in Portland.
Portland is currently struggling to manage numerous challenges, including overwhelming
homelessness, staf fing shortages and an increased demand for public services and investment in
infrastructure. We know many other Maine municipalities are similarly challenged. As cannabis
sales and excise tax revenues would not be possible without the local ordinances permitting
those retail sales, we ur ge the Committee to allow those municipalities to benefit from local
sales.
Thank you for your consideration.
