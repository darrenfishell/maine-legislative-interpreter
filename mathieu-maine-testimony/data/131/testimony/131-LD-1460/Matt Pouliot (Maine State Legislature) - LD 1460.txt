April 18, 2023 
Good Afternoon Senator Bailey" , Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance & Financial Services Committee, I am Senator Matt Pouliot and I have the honor of 
representing Senate District 15, including the towns of Augusta; Belgrade; China; Mount 
Vernon; Sidney; and Vassalboro. I am here today to present LD 1460, “An Act to Amend the 
Laws Governing Certiﬁcates of Deposit. ” 
I Was asked by a constituent to put this legislation in as he felt there needs to be changes to the 
current certiﬁcate of deposit laws. You will hear from him today on his reasons for wanting 
these changes made to this section of law. 
This bill allows a depositor of a time deposit, otherwise known as a certiﬁcate of deposit, or CD, 
to send the ﬁnancial institution holding the time deposit a letter of intent within 90 days prior to 
the maturity of the time deposit indicating the depositor's intentions as to the disposition of the 
funds upon maturity. This bill also allows a depositor of a time deposit to Withdraw funds from 
the time deposit before maturity without penalty in the case of a bona ﬁde emergency or 
ﬁnancial hardship of the depositor or if the depositor is required to enter a nursing home or 
assisted housing program that charges a fee. 
I appreciate your consideration of this legislation. Thank you.
