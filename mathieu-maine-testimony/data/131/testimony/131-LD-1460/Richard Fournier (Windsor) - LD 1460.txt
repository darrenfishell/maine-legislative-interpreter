I support a bill to change Certificate of Deposit (CD) renewing law. Presently the CD 
automatically renews on maturity date. To make changes you must go in on maturity date 
which gives you 7 calendar days to withdraw or make changes to CD. Presently if you go in 
after the 7 day's you are penalized either 90 or 180 days of interest. 
Would like to see the 7 calendar days after Maturity date changed to a letter of intent which 
may be turned in 90 days before maturity date on what depositor wants to do with CD when it 
matures. Presently all Credit Unions, Banks and other financial institutions require you to come 
in person within 7 Calendar days from maturity date. Also, when financial institutions are 
closed Saturday and Sunday with a holiday in the week you have 4 business days. 
Also, should be an emergency clause if you get sick, or accident, or other disaster to pay off 
medical bills there should be a way to withdraw without penalties. And if you are elderly which 
family must put person in a nursing home the money should be withdrawn without penalty to 
pay for nursing home. 
With today's technologies this should be easy to put in computers, so on maturity date the 
wishes of CD owners could be done without physically going in person to Credit Unions, Banks, 
and financial institution. When you buy a CD, it automatically renews which l did not know how 
difficult it is to withdraw money without penalty.
