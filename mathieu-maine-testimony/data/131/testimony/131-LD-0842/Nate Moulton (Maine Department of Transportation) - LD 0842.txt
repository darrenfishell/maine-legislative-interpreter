Testimony of Nate Moulton 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131*‘ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
In Opposition 
LD 842, An Act to Strengthen the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority by Inviting 
Participation on the Board of Directors by and Negotiating for Funding from the State of New 
Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Nate Moulton, Transportation Planning Division Director at 
MaineDOT. MaineDOT is opposed to LD 842, An Act to Strengthen the Northern New England 
Passenger Rail Authority by Inviting Participation on the Board of Directors by and Negotiating 
for Funding from the State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
This bill allows the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority to invite participation to the 
authority's board from the states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts and requires the authority 
to negotiate with those states to obtain funding for the operation of the Amtrak Downeaster 
passenger rail service. 
It is unclear in the language of LD 842 whether representatives from New Hampshire and 
Massachusetts would have voting privileges should this bill pass. Furthermore, current Maine 
statute authorizes the Governor of the State of Maine to appoint members to the NNEPRA Board 
of Directors and requires that the Maine Legislature conﬁrm appointments. LD 842 does not 
specify who would appoint these new representatives and whether they would be subject to 
Maine State legislative approval. 
We understand that NNEPRA has a close working relationship with our two neighboring states 
to the south and both contribute ﬁnancially to the operation of the Downeaster. Both states incur 
the cost of maintenance, stafﬁng, and insurance of the station facilities and platforms located 
within their state and partner with NNEPRA to fund capital improvement projects which beneﬁt 
the entire Downeaster service. 
Passage of LD 842 could impede NNEPRA’s ability to manage and grow Maine’s passenger rail 
system. It is for these reasons we request the committee vote ought not to pass on this 
legislation. Thank you.
