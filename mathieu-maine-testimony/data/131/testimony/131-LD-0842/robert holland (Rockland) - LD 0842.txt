LD 842
Having ridden the Downeaster on my travels from Roanoke to Rockland  in the past - 
before we retired permanently here - I can tell you the Mass folks on the train were 
very happy to be heading to Maine.  I believe companion bill LD860 - when in-acted -
will demonstrate that the State of Maineis serious about the extension of service and 
should  garner their support based on extended and expanded destinations.   In 
particular, Acadia via Bangor and existing and likely expanded bus service.  
I support LD 842 in the best long term interest and economics of the state.  I have 50 
years of direct involvement with the rail industry and its economics.  Respectfully, 
Robert E. Holland
