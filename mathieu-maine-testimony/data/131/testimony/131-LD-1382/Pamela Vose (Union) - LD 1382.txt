Pamela Vose
Union
LD 1382
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on this highly political bill based on pseudo 
science and clearly political purposes.
This bill is not in the best interest of the people of the State of Maine.  Public health 
officials must be able to do their job without the interference of partisan politicians 
looking to score political points.
