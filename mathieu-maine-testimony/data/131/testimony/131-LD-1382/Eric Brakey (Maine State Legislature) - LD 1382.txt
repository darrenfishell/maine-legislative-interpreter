Senator Eric Brakey 
Presenting L.D. 1382, “An Act to Establish the Guiding Public Health 
Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics ofa 
Highly Infectious Respiratory Disease” 
Before the Health and Human Services Committee 
Monday, April 24, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on Health and 
Human Services: l am Eric Brakey, Androscoggin Senator, representing the people of 
Auburn, New Gloucester, Poland, and Durham. 
Thank you for your time and attention today as I present L.D. 1382, “An Act to Establish 
the Guiding Public Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of a Highly 
Infectious Respiratory Disease. ” 
As some may recall, we recently experienced an unprecedented state of emergency, 
lasting fifteen months, in which the executive branch was invested with the powers of 
the legislature. (lt is worth noting that, in the Roman Republic, when a single individual 
was invested with the power to both make and execute laws for a period of emergency, 
they called this a “dictatorship. ”) 
During this period of dictatorship (which occurred not only in Maine, but also in many 
states across this country and the world), instead of formal law-making as we are 
conducting today —— in which elected representatives hear from the public and consider 
all the various interests at stake in a proposed policy — we had law-making by 
executive mandate with no public input on policies that profoundly impacted the lives of 
every man, woman, and child in the state of Maine. 
In that time of pandemic, the Governor instituted lockdown-focused policies —a 
deviation from the norm of how we've dealt with viral respiratory pandemics of the past» 
— which sought to prevent the public from breathing in the vicinity of and touching one 
another. To that end, we experienced the mass quarantine of largely healthy populations 
through shelter in place orders; businesses closures; school closures; church, 
synagogue, and mosque closures; and public propaganda campaigns with ever-shifting 
facts and goal posts, promoting fear of your neighbor as a biohazard, which included 
the censorship of dissenting voices from both the public at-large and the scientiﬁc 
community.
Now that this aberrant period is largely in our rean/iew mirror, prudence demands we 
reflect on what took place, take stock of the benefits and harms these policies created, 
and apply what lessons we can learn to avoid making the same mistakes in future 
pandemics. 
ln November 2020, three epidemiologists from Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford authored 
a document called “The Great Barrington Declaration, ” which criticized lockdown 
policies for:
“ ...producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The 
results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, 
worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and 
deteriorating mental health — leading to greater excess mortality in years 
to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying 
the heaviest burden." 
Instead of universal lockdowns, they recommended a public health strategy built around 
focused protection of the vulnerable and recognition of the gradual development of herd 
immunity among: 
“We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more thana 
thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for 
children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including 
influenza. 
“As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all — including 
the vulnerable — falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach 
herd immunity - i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable 
- and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. 
Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until 
we reach herd immunity. 
“The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits 
of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of 
death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through 
natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We 
call this Focused Protection." 
lt is also worth noting (andof relevance to other legislation you are hearing today) that 
these epidemiologists also recommended utilizing healthcare working with natural 
immunity from a prior infection to care for the most vulnerable in nursing homes:
“ ...nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform 
frequent testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be 
minimized. ” 
Utilizing healthcare workers with natural immunity (which is the most effective protection 
against infection and transmission), was the recommendation. Instead, many of these 
healthcare workers were ﬁred from their jobs.
The Great Barrington Declaration has been co-signed by nearly one million individuals 
across the world, including 16,067 medical and public health scientists, as well as 
47,541 medical practitioners. (For reference, the full text is included with my supporting 
documents.) 
This legislation would enact into statute seven guiding principles, built upona 
foundation of focused protection, which should have guided us through this past 
pandemic, but still can guide us through future such events. 
These principles were outlined by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University (one of 
the three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration) during a November 2022 
presentation at the Soho Forum. With the remainder of my testimony, I will share each 
one and the reasons for them. 
A. Public health advice must consider the impact on overall public health 
rather than be solely concerned with a single disease and consider the 
benefits and harms of any public health measure, weighing the short-term 
versus the long-term consequences of the measure; 
One of the great flaws of the COVlD response was single-minded focus on the spread 
of the virus, while disregarding the negative consequences on other aspects of public 
health that resulted from the measures taken. 
Among the direct consequences of lockdown policies include: 
¢ Rising rates of depression, suicide, obesity, alcohol and substance abuse, DUI 
and overdose deaths, domestic violence; 
0 Short-term and long-term rising poverty rates from economic and educational 
disruptions; 
0 Delayed preventative medical care due to the suspension of “elective ” 
procedures. 
While the full picture of damage from lockdowns is something we will likely grapple to 
understand throughout the next generation, we can begin to make sense of it all by 
examining excess mortality rates — death rates that exceed the baseline based on 
recent trends. 
According to a report of the Maine Policy institute (included with my supplemental 
documents), when we examine the excess mortality rates for Maine in 2021, 43% more 
Mainers aged 30 to 49 died than would be expected in a “normal year.” This excess 
mortality rate is nearly 20% higher than any other age group, which should raise alarm 
bells because this is an age category not especially vulnerable to COVlD—19. 
Across all age groups, the report concludes that COVlD-19 itself only accounts for 
about half of the excess mortalities.
Maine Annual Excess Mortality By Age Group, 2020-21 
292 0 2021 
15-29 -1.8 -0.97% 9.2 4.98% 
30-4-9 111.4 16.49% 293.4 43.43% 
50~64- 153.4 9.30% 4-05.4 24.58% 
65-74» 319.4- 12.05% 695.4 26.24% 
75-34- 322.8 9.05% 741.8 20.89% 
85+ 159 3.25% 281 5.74% 
All Ages 1965.2 7.79% 2403.21 
17.57% 
By focusing on COVID-19 transmission to the exclusion of all other measures for public 
health, lockdown policies created numerous additional public health crises beyond the 
pandemic itself. 
B. Public health policy must protect the most vulnerable populations of the 
State, including children, low-income families, individuals with disabilities 
and the elderly, and may not shift the burden of protecting against the 
disease from the affluent to the less affluent; 
As Bhattachalya describes it, lockdowns are a “trickle-down epidemiology policy where 
the idea is if we protect the laptop class, everyone else is protected. ” 
But of course, not everyone could afford to shelter in place, work from home, and 
ensure adequate education for their children. Those on the economic margins — who 
were often at low risk for severe COVID infection — were among the hardest hit by the 
effects of lockdown policies. 
Further, while Maine experienced lower rates than many states, it is hard to definitively 
isolate the reasons for this. With data from all 50 states, including control groups like 
Florida (which adopted focused protection measures instead of lockdowns), there is no 
clear correlation between lockdown policies and COVID rates. 
, C. Public health advice must addressthe needs of each population in the 
State within the cultural, religious, geographic and other contexts of the 
population. If a population in the.State believes that places of worship are 
essential, the public health advice should consider places of worship as 
essential in determining the advice; 
Churches, mosques, and synagogues were shut down, while liquor stores stayed open. 
The lack of respect for the cultural and religious needs of Maine populations, paired with 
clearly arbitrary designations for what was essential and what was non-essential, has 
bred a justiﬁable lack of trust in public health officials across many communities.
D. Public health policy must be based on comparative risk evaluations, risk 
reductions and reducing uncertainties using the best available scientific 
evidence but recognizing that risk cannot be entirely eliminated; 
As Bhattacharya again notes, the “idea that we have to live with risk — there is no 
perfect, there are only trade offs — is central to public health and something that the 
public was misled about during the pandemic. ” 
E. Public health recommendations must present facts as the basis for 
guidance and may not employ fear, shame or falsehood to manipulate the 
public; 
Public health requires public trust. 
Throughout the pandemic, however, we found ourselves subject to public health officials 
promoting so-called “noble lies." This included: 
0 Shifting timelines for emergency measures, beginning with what was billed to the 
people as just “two weeks to stop the spread” in order to buy preparatory time for 
hospitals. 
0 Changing guidance on the effectiveness of masks -— not based on updated 
scientific understanding, but based upon the availability of masks. 
0 Grossly overstating the effectiveness of COVID vaccination at preventing viral 
infection and transmission (despite a lack of scientiﬁc evidence to support those 
claims) and downplaying any reported negative effects. 
0 Misleading the public on the nature of alternative treatments being pursued by 
other medical professionals (for example, a national media campaign mislabeling 
lvermectin — an FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug that won the 2015 Nobel Prize 
in Medicine —- as a “horse medicine.") 
0 Asserting false claims of certainly over viral origins and coordinated efforts to 
suppress the lab leak theory by the -very public health officials who approved 
taxpayer funding for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. 
When members of the public, including highly qualiﬁed scientific experts, disrupted 
these claims, public health officials coordinated with media partners (especially social 
media companies) to engage in widespread censorship instead of public debate. 
Lies and censorship, no matter how well-intended, have done lasting damage to the 
public’s trust in our public health institutions.
F. Medical interventions may not be forced on a population, and a population 
may not be coerced into medical interventions, and medical interventions 
must be voluntary and based upon informed consent. A public health 
official must advise and may not set rules and must provide information 
and resources for an individual to make an informed decision; and 
This is supposed to be a free country. When it comes to our health decisions, 
recommendations from public health authorities are welcome, but force and coercion 
are not. The slew of mandates imposed on the Maine people, most with questionable 
effectiveness as we look back with hindsight, were never appropriate. 
G. Public health authorities must be honest and transparent with what is both 
known and unknown, advice given must be evidence-based and explained 
by data and the authorities must acknowledge errors or changes in 
evidence as soon as the authorities are aware of the changes. 
A dangerous degree of arrogance has crept into our public health institutions. As 
Bhattacharya notes, “we should not have people in charge of public health who believe 
they are science itself.” 
Mistakes are inevitable. They will happen. But public health ofﬁcial should be upfront 
with the public on the degree of certainty they have with their recommendations and the 
evidence that supports them. When their critics (whom they censored) turn out to be 
right, they should not defer accountability with a slight of hand claiming “the science has 
changed. ” If the science has changed, why were so many blacklisted scientists accurate 
in pointing out the lack of scientific basis for those recommendations? 
Now that the public health emergency is over, there must be some degree of reﬂection 
on the extra-constitutional measures that were implemented with no public legislative 
process, and reconciliation for the unnecessary harms those policies imposed on the 
Maine people. 
I've brought this legislation forward with hope of encouraging that process and putting 
into statute some of the lessons learned from our recent experiences. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. l will gladly take any questions.
The Great Barrington Declaration 
As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have 
grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of 
the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call 
Focused Protection. 
Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted 
our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing 
devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to 
name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, Worsening 
cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating 
mental health — leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the 
working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. 
Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice. 
Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause 
irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed. 
Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that 
vulnerability to death from COVID—19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in 
the old and inﬁrm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID—19 is less 
dangerous than many other harms, including inﬂuenza. 
As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all — including 
the vulnerable — falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd 
immunity — i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable — and 
that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal 
should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach 
herd immunity. 
The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and beneﬁts of 
reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to 
live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural 
infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this 
Focused Protection. 
Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of 
public health responses to COVlD—19. By way of example, nursing homes 
should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent testing of 
other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people 
living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their
home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than 
inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches 
to multi—generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the 
scope and capability of public health professionals. 
Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life 
as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home 
when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity 
threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. 
Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low—risk 
adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other 
businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities 
should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they Wish, 
while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable 
by those who have built up herd immunity. 
On October 4, 2020, this declaration was authored and signed in Great 
Barrington, United States, by: 
Dr. Martin Kulldorff, professor of medicine at Harvard University, a 
biostatistician, and epidemiologist with expertise in detecting and 
monitoring infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety evaluations.

expertise in immunology, vaccine development, and mathematical“ 
modeling

Key Findings 
0 Mortality attributed to COVID-19 only explains about half of the excess in 2020 and 2021. 
0 In 2021, 43% more Mainers aged 30 to 49 died than would be expected in a normal year. 
0 In nearly all age groups, excess mortality was greatest in the last quarter of 2021. 
0 Maine recorded 58% more drug overdose deaths in 2020 and 2021 compared to the 2015-2019 
quarterly average. 
0 Mainers under age 40 had more than 17-times-greater risk of dying from a drug overdose than 
from COVID-19 over 2020 and 2021. 
2021: AMERICA'S DEADLIEST YEAR EVER 
There is no denying it. Over the last tvvo-and-a-half years, the United States has seen a sustained increase 
in mortality. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that from 2019 to 2021, 
average life expectancy at birth in the United States declined by 2.7 years, the largest two-year decline 
since the early 1920s.1 Every state saw a decline; from New York, which saw the average lifetime shrink by 
three years, to Hawaii, which had a 0.2 year drop? 
The CDC dubbed 2021, the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation’s "deadliest year ever."5 This 
is determined by measuring "excess mortality," establishing a historical baseline rate of overall deaths, or 
a way to compare to an average year, and measuring deviation from that level over time. Americans aged 
15-64 who died in 2021 was a staggering 40% greater than what would be expected based on historical 
trends.-4- While 2020 deaths were also above the historical average, it was nothing like 2021. 
These staggering and sobering statistics caught the attention of life insurers in early 2022. Scott Davison, 
CEO of Indiana-based life insurer, OneAmerica, reported during a Chamber of Commerce virtual event that 
his company saw death rates increase by 40% compared to the pre-pandemic period, and that was seen 
across the industry? Some in the business are wondering if this is indicative of undercounted 
COVID-related deaths. Jonathan Porter, global chief risk officer with Reinsurance Group of America Inc. 
(RGA] explained their thought process on a conference call: "One of the things that makes us believe that 
these really are direct or indirect COVID is the causes of death tend to be comorbid with COVID. 
Alzheimer's, diabetes, things like that, but in addition they tend to move with the COVID deaths.” -"l 
While some may attribute the mortality spike to the pandemic, an April 2022 paper published in the 
journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) studied 21 peer nations in addition to the US, but 
found that none experienced decreases in life expectancy as large as the US. These nations, which included 
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK), also faced significant infection rates of SARS-CoV-2, the virus 
which causes COVID-19.3 Many confounding factors make finding a direct correlation to the pandemic 
difficult, but the difference between American mortality to similar nations begs for an explanation. 
Following the acknowledgement of the spike in death over 2021, public health experts have offered 
several theories as to why it might be happening. Some say that it is latent effects from the pandemic; 
more people caught COVID-19 than we could count, and we know that some patients have some lingering 
effects from the illness, so these deaths could be lagging effects of so-called "Long-COVID."
7
Since COVID-19 affects younger and healthier populations less than older, less healthy individuals, some 
question whether the spikes in deaths of Americans under 65 are due to the somewhat-novel respiratory 
illness. Official statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO)? UK? and US CDC3-L3 show the vast 
majority of excess mortality occurring in 2021 and 2022 cannot be attributed to COVID-19. Instead, it is 
more likely these are the effects of delayed preventative medical care due to suspension of "elective" 
procedures during 2020, in addition to the immense social effects of lockdownsl-1 that drove sustained 
depression and economic malaise, which can also cut lives short.“ 
Casey Mulligan and Robert Arnott wrote of this "historic, yet largely unacknowledged, health emergency" 
of dramatically increasing excess deaths among young and middle-aged American adults in a working 
paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER] in Iune 2022: 
"The age pattern of excess non-COVID deaths reveals something about the types of factors driving 
poor health during the pandemic. With the young experiencing so many excess deaths, even though 
their average personal risk from Covid is minimal, many of the pandemic ’s effects on health seem to 
be working through market channels." 
They assert that lockdown policies, "such as closing workplaces or changing law enforcement practices, 
may have made it more expensive to maintain health or made unhealthy lifestyles less eXpensive."i3 
Consequences ofisolation fell predominantly on younger Americans, though the elderly were not spared. 
Lockdowns pursued in their name meant that those in long-term care homes and hospitals who were not 
allowed visitation by family or friends, critical lifelines to the outside world. State policy emphasized 
isolation and disconnection among the population, young and old. 
Lockdowns, tried in spring 2020 for the first time in history, continued far beyond that initial panic of an 
unknown coronavirus emerging from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. These prohibitions and 
restrictions receded, then swelled again and again over the course of the last two-and-a-half years, 
continuing to cast a shadow over Americans ’ daily lives. 
How many lives did we actually save in the pursuit of suppressing the coronavirus? Studying changes in 
all-cause mortality, or the overall death rate among the population, compared to the pre-pandemic period 
will allow for a more unobstructed view of the effects of these novel policies. lt will highlight which age 
groups and causes of death warrant further examination. Comparing those with historical cause of death 
data will help parse out a truer picture of the impact on life over the last two years. 
This analysis necessitates the use of federal CDC data because Maine CDC has not been fully transparent 
with data related to COVID-19, as well as other issues.“ Limited data offered by health care systems and 
by state officials like Dr. Nirav Shah, director of Maine CDC and Governor Janet Mills made determining 
which fatalities and hospitalizations were caused by COVID-19 difficult. 
While some hospital systems report how many patients were admitted ”for COVID" versus “with COVID," 
they don't all count it the same way. That question had not even been addressed in the public sphere until 
late 2021, so for the first 18 months of the pandemic, the public heard "COVID-19 deaths" reported not 
realizing that those could have been anyone who passed away after having received a relatively recent
positive PCR test result. Because of this policy, deaths attributed to COVID likely overcount the number of 
true deaths "from COVlD," rather than undercount. 
Hospitals in Maine rarely distinguished between incidental and primary admissions for COVID 
hospitalization or deaths (“with COVID" vs "from COVID," respectively) in its public data reports. Maine 
CDC’s estimates on incidental hospitalizations were only released upon specific request from legislators. 
Some estimates, offered by representatives of large hospital systems like MaineHealth, ranged from 20% 
to 30% of patients being admitted for something other than COVID-19, but testing positive during their 
stay}? Every patient admitted to Maine hospitals were being tested for the virus, sometimes daily, but 
certainly upon admission. Thus, figures of “COVID-related ” deaths are likely inﬂated from continuing this 
practice for more than two years. 
Additional mischaracterization was more likely to occur during the prevalence of the Omicron subvariants 
of SARS-CoV-2. For instance, by Iune 2022, the weekly UK-based news and culture magazine, The 
Spectator, noted that 65% of COVID-positive National Health Service (NHS) patients were not primarily 
being treated for the virus.-‘*5 A preprint paper first appearing in early lune 2022 supported by the Keck 
School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found that “67.5% of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive 
hospital admissions were not for COVID-19 but with COVID-19."E 
In a paper recently published in Lancet, a prestigious UK medical journal, researchers attempted to 
measure excess mortality "due to the pandemic" and found that their estimate is more than triple the 
number of reported COVID-19 deaths worldwide: 
"In addition to deaths from SARS-Col/-2 infection, social distancing mandates and other pandemic 
restrictions might have decreased deaths from some diseases and injuries, such as road accidents, 
and increased others, such as deaths from chronic and acute conditions aﬁected by deferred 
care-seeking in overstretched health—care systems, relative to expected or baseline conditions... The 
magnitude of disease burden might have changed for many causes of death during the pandemic 
period due to both direct eﬁects of Iockdowns and the resulting economic turmoil. To correctly divide 
excess deaths into those directly due to SARS-Col/-2 infection and those associated with changes in 
other diseases and injuries, multiple drivers of change in mortality since the onset of the pandemic 
need to be considered. ” 
These researchers concede that within their definition of deaths "due to the pandemic," they include the 
effects of lockdown policies which caused the loss of millions of livelihoods and separated people from 
their communities. ln this way, the paper regards the "effects of the pandemic" to be much greater than 
what has been attributed to the virus itself, even with the liberal application COVID as cause of death. As 
they mentioned, multiple potential drivers for mortality must be discusseclg

In order to better understand which groups were most affected by this spike in mortality, we looked at 
two datasets from the CDC using slightly different age groupings. Deriving a historical baseline of 
mortality from weekly data across 2015 to 2019, we find considerable annual excess mortality in 2020 of 
more than 10%—but that paled in comparison to 2021, when the state saw an excess of more than 20% 
on average. In raw numbers, about 1,065 more Mainers than expected passed away in 2020, but more 
than 2,400 more died in 2021. Most staggering, 43% more Mainers aged 30 to 49 died in 2021 than would 
be expected in a "normal" year?

Data from CDC Quarterly Provisional Mortality estimates show a substantial spike in mortality across all 
age groups in the final quarter of 2021, with the worst befalling Mainers between age 30 and 49. While 
excess mortality among those between 50 and 64 trended generally within the bounds of the 
population-wide average, excess death in that age group jumped to become significantly higher than the 
average by the last half of 202 LE

Looking at deaths attributed to “COVID" versus those which are not (referred herein as “non-COVID" 
deaths], we find greater non-COVID excess mortality in Maine among younger age groups in 2020, which 
seemed to have caught up to older groups in 2021. Middle-age groups experienced this phenomenon in 
both years, though also much worse in 2021. The graphs below demonstrate the extent to which deaths 
attributed to COVID and non-COVID causes made up that age group's overall excess mortality each 
quarter? “

2 53 Q-I 
Source: CDC
While older age groups experienced significant COVID-related mortality during 2020 and into the winter 
surge of early 2021, data show that the virus can explain only about half of the excess. Excess mortality 
skyrocketed in the last half of 2021, with COVID-related deaths rising as well as non-COVID causes, even 
though COVID-19 vaccination was widely accepted. Perhaps most striking is that, while Mainers aged 30 
to 49 experienced few COVID-related deaths for most of the pandemic, those jumped in the last quarter of 
2021 to drive 26% excess deaths, while non-COVID causes also spiked to contribute another 46% excess. 
Overall, 73% more Mainers aged 30-4-9 died during the last three months of 2021 than would be expected. 
USMortality.com shows that even during the winter COVID surge of late 2020 and early 2021, Maine's 
excess mortality percentage exceeded the normal range for only a short time. But, in the latter half of 
2021, the state saw between 18% and 42% more deaths than expected each week during this time, 
greater than at any time in 2020.21 It is difficult to overstate how rare a mortality event like this is in 
human history. Life insurers like OneAmerica and RGA quoted above regard a 10% increase in excess 
mortality as a three-standard —deviation occurrence, or a once-in-200-year event. Frankly, 30-40% excess 
is astronomical. 
In 2021, more Mainers’ deaths were attributed to COVID than in 2020, growing concurrently with 
non-COVID deaths over the year. An August 2022 report by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) found that 
Americans younger than 45 were at higher risk of death for non-COVID causes over the pandemic??- 
Indications that COVID-19 is not the primary driver ofghigher-than-expected mortality prompt further 
investigation to other possible explanations. 
In most-to-all age groups, excess mortality was the highest in the fourth quarter of 2021. Why was this the 
case? Shouldn't we have seen lower mortality —at least from COVID-19 itself, to say nothing of overall 
mortality —from widely deploying several new public health strategies like COVID-19 vaccination and 
treatments like Pfizer's Paxlovid? Shouldn’t the state and the nation have been able to save more lives, not 
fewer, as the pandemic progressed and science and government officials learned more? 
DELAYED MEDICAL CARE 
in mid-March, just before Governor Janet Mills declared the state of emergency, the U.S. Surgeon General 
called on states to delay "elective" medical procedures to attempt to conserve personal protective 
equipment (PPE) and hospital capacity in the event of exponential growth in serious coronavirus cases.“ 
A more specific, tiered framework was distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 
April 2020 to help medical professionals and hospitals develop a standard ofcare within the new 
paradigm?-5 
The list of so-called "non-essential" procedures include regular check-ups, cancer screenings like 
mammograms, joint surgeries, as well as some preventative care visits such as pediatric vaccinationszgé 
Patients who had to postpone their biopsy or cancer screening delayed a potentially earlier diagnosis 
crucial to ensuring recovery. The Maine CDC's Shared Community Health Needs Assessment Report 2022 
recognized that pandemic-era "challenges in accessing care have impacted chronic disease management 
and caused delays in nonemergency procedures." ~3’~Z'
6
In August 2020, Maine Policy warned about the effects of canceling or postponing important medical 
procedures like these? referencing a report published in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public 
Health Emergency COVID-19 Initiative that noted the "consequences of surgical delays will likely manifest 
in increased costs to the health care system. . .often requiring more intense and more costly treatment."2"3 
Given NIH’s 2020 warning, public health officials should be looking into how delayed medical care played 
into the overall need for health care services, as well as disease progression among patients who could not 
see their provider. Are these effects evident in the provisional mortality data, or is it too early to tell? 
CDC WONDER data on cause-of-death by ICD-10 codingw show that excess deaths among Mainers 
attributed to circulatory system failure (I00-I99) rose 3.5% in 2020, but doubled proportionally over the 
next year to 7%.-ii The Wall Street journal reported similar data nationally: "Mortality rates from heart 
disease and stroke rose 4.3% and 6.4% respectively in 2O2O."i3 Heart disease, the number one cause of 
death for Americans}? driven by the nation's concurrent epidemics of obesity and diabetes, is rampant 
even in "good" years. 
Deaths attributed to diseases of the endocrine system (E00-E88) in Maine were 6.7% higher than 
expected in 2020, a proportion which nearly-tripled to 17.9% excess in 2021.5-4 Despite many delayed or 
skipped cancer screenings and treatments over 2O20,3‘ —5~ 
deemed "elective procedures," neither Maine nor 
US mortality data show significantly higher excess deaths attributed to cancers. It is possible that the 
effects will not be seen in mortality data for many years. 
These examples of delayed and withheld medical care pertain to non-COVID causes, but some suggest that 
top-down approach to developing care protocols for COVID-19 also led to greater mortality attributed to 
the virus. 
Several doctors found success experimenting with multi-drug protocols to treat COVID-19 illness in the 
first months of the pandemic, but were ultimately ignored by leading public health officials. Dr. Pierre 
Kory of the Frontline COVID~19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC] testified to a Senate committee in May 2020 
that lack of recommending methylprednisolone, a steroid which he noted was used with success in prior 
coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and MERS, is "causing needless death”?-Q The National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) never included it in its directives, even recommending against several other commonly-used drugs 
and supplements mentioned in FLCCC protocols? like vitamin D, vitamin C, Zinc,-33 and lvermectin.33 
DEATHS OF DESPAIR 
The recent spike in youth mental illness?- ‘Z and suicidal ideationil alone should be a wake-up call to anyone 
still clamoring for more COVID-inspired mandates on the youth, but many other unintended consequences 
of locking down younger populations have also reared their ugly heads. Often called "deaths of despair," 
these are those who have succumbed to alcohol abuse, drug addiction, or depression leading to suicide. 
Over 2020 and 2021 the United States saw significantly more of these cases, the vast majority of whom 
were under age 60.
7
Both the US and Maine CDC recorded significant jumps in emergency department (ED) visits for suicide 
attempts during the pandemic years 2020 and 2021. Overdoses involving fentanyl, a powerful synthetic 
opioid, are now the leading cause of death among Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.2 More 
Americans aged 16 to 64 died from alcohol-related causes than from COVID-19 over 2020 and the first 
halfof2021. “-5 
There were clear warning signs for state and federal health officials over 2020 and 2021, showing how 
their pandemic policies contributed to a more sedentary and depressed youth population.-4-1 Yet, it took the 
CDC until August of 2022 to advise school children not to miss class because of an exposure to someone 
who tested positive for the coronavirus, nor to be tested themselves if they are not symptomatic. Data has 
shown for nearly two years that school-aged children face a vanishingly low risk of severe outcomes from 
a case of COVID-19. 
Officials seemingly ignored the unintended consequences of lockdown policies and delayed issuing 
sensible guidance based on real-world evidence for many more months than necessary. 
SUICIDE AND DEPRESSION 
In June 2021, the CDC reported that, from mid-Feburary to mid-March 2021, "suspected suicide attempt 
ED visits were 50.6% higher among girls aged 12 to 17 years than during the same period in 2019." -E By 
March, the agency reported survey results showing that, over the prior year, among American high 
schoolers, ”44.2% experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, 19.9% had seriously 
considered attempting suicide, and 9.0% had attempted suicide."4 ‘§ 
Researchers affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia wrote in the September 2021 issue of 
the journal Pediatrics that, while primary care visits for depression screening fell slightly among 12 to 21 
year-old adolescents between the last half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, screeners recorded 
significantly more patients with suicidal thoughts. Perhaps a sad harbinger of the future, the study noted 
that "positive suicide risk screens increased" around 16%, showing “a 34% relative increase in reporting 
recent suicidal thoughts among female adolescents." ‘l"?" 
Sadly, Maine CDC data mirror this trend. Emergency department visits “involving suicidal intent” were 
24% higher in 2020 and 17% higher in 2021, compared to the 2017-19 quarterly average. Over all of 
2020 and 2021, deaths by suicide were about 4% lower than the 2018-19 average, but tragically, spring 
and summer of 2021 saw 10% more than expected ﬁ 
The late-2021 spike in suicide in Maine is a likely signal of growing anxiety and depression within the 
population. A tragic, but sadly predictable outcome of the massive disruptions to daily life and mandated 
social isolation brought on by lockdown policies pursued by the Mills administration for many months, 
the repercussions of which are still being felt in 2022. 
ALCGHGL 
Another symptom of growing despair among the American population, The New York Times reported ona 
September 2020 study in IAMA which found that, "Americans increased the frequency of their alcohol
8
consumption by 14 percent compared to a year earlier." This was an early signal that Americans were 
turning to alcohol to cope with non-stop pandemic- and lockdown —induced stress. The IAMA study also 
found "a 41 percent increase in the number of days on which women drank heavily, defined as having four 
or more drinks in a couple of hours."‘33 
In February 2021, the American Psychological Association [APA) published a national survey finding that 
23% of adults reported drinking more in the year preceding to manage stress, but among parents, rates 
were even higher; 29% of mothers and 48% of fathers reported drinking more to cope. ”Nearly half of 
mothers who still have children home for remote learning (47%) reported their mental health has 
worsened."-:4 ‘ 
It's no surprise that increased alcohol use brings myriad other detrimental social and health outcomes. 
The Times reporting continued: 
"psychological damage from the past year has caused sharp declines in physical health, including 
widespread weight gain and disruptions in sleep. Hospitals around the country have reported an 
increase in admissions for hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure and other forms of alcohol-related 
diseases." 
Before the pandemic, CDC reported that alcohol-related causes were responsible for the deaths of 380 
Americans per day, or more than 138,000 every year?-1 By May 2022, a review of mortality in the US due to 
alcohol-use disorder (AUD) found a staggering surge compared to previous years. In 2020, AUD-related 
deaths were 25% higher than history would suggest; in 2021, researchers saw 22% more. Perhaps most 
tragically, “the youngest age group [25-44 years) demonstrated the largest increase in AUD mortality 
(40.47% in 2020 vs 33.95% in 2021) across all age groups."E

The increase in drinking and alcohol-related fatalities extended to the roadways as well. Deaths attributed 
to driving under the inﬂuence (DUI) rose nearly 15% nationwide from 2019 to 2020, according to the DUI 
Report from Zutobi, an online drivers’ education resource website. The report called 2020 “the worst year
9 
since 2005." Maine was ranked 6th-worst in Zutobi’s "DUI Severity Score," with 28% more DUI-related 
deaths in 2020 year-over-year which made up nearly 40% of all road fatalities? Authors noted that this 
spike in drunk driving “could be because of the increased loneliness that came with COVID 19 and the 
shutdowns?- ‘l-* leading to increased consumption in the home." 
This led the Bangor Daily News to declare that "Maine has an OUI problem," noting that CDC data show 
“Maine had the highest rate of alcoholic liver disease deaths in the Northeast — including New England — in 
2020. . .the 11th-highest rate of such deaths in the country." ﬁ 
DRUG OVERDOSE 
Maine, and the nation at large, has seen a dramatic uptick in drug 
overdoses during the pandemic era as well. In 2021, fatal overdoses 
surpassed a staggering 100,000 in the United Statesiﬁ In Maine, all 
drug-related emergencies have become more common. Statewide 
distribution of the overdose-reversal drug Naloxone, also known as 
Narcan, doubled in the first half of 2022, after steadily increasing 
over the previous two years?-'5 
Over 2020 and 2021, Maine recorded 1,136 total drug overdose 
deaths, 58% greater than the 2015-19 quarterly baseline. Though 
the opioid crisis is not a new public health issue——the last decade 
saw a tripling of yearly drug deaths—it has reached unfathomable 
levels in the last two years.§‘l Among all 50 states, Maine has the 
9th-highest rate of death by drug overdose. “-*3 State~Suppliec1 Naloxozie

To put this in perspective, over 2020 and 2021, Mainers under age 40 had more than 17-times-greater 
risk of dying from a drug overdose than from COVID-19? “ Those aged 40 to 59 had nearly-triple the risk of 
death from an overdose. Only for those at least 60 years of age and older did COVID-19 pose a greater risk. 
If one looks critically at how COVID deaths were counted, it is possible that the risk for younger Mainers 
from COVID is even less.

if 0.00 —i under 40 age 40-59 age 60+ 
Sadly, this trend has not slowed down in the first half of 2022. Ianuary through lune 2022 saw 9.7% more 
fatal overdoses than the same time period a year in 2021, according to the "Maine Monthly Overdose 
Report" put together by the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center and funded by the state Attorney General 
and Office of Behavioral Health?- 
Since the age groups in Maine drug overdose data do not overlap exactly with CDC provisional mortality 
data, this analysis assumes that 80% of the drug overdoses reported by those over 60 were under 65, 
likely a conservative estimate since those who succumb to a drug overdose are more likely to be younger. 
Drug overdoses accounted for about half of the excess mortality experienced by Mainers aged 15-64 
through 2020. Even though overdoses shot up even higher over 2021, so did overall mortality, so it 
accounted for much fewer of those prime-aged Mainers’ early deaths in 2021. 
EFFECT OF EMERGENCY USE COVID-19 VACCINATION 
The distribution of COVID-19 vaccine doses in early 2021, the vast majority of which used messenger RNA 
(mRNA) technology, was a public health intervention of unprecedented scale. The vaccination program 
was implemented nationwide in the first half of 2021, but not during the initial waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. 
Per-capita COVID-related deaths among Mainers over the age of 60 in 2021 were double that of 2020. 
Why did Maine and the nation see the highest mortality rates ever recorded after the vaccines were 
available? The broad uptake of vaccines over 2021 should have contributed to lower death rates overall, 
or at least from COVID itself. 
The concept of “survivorship bias"§’-3 tells us that those most likely to succumb to the pandemic would have 
done so in the earlier waves, especially as the average severity of successive strains of the virus 
diminished, consistent with evolutionary tendency toward viral attenuation. “
17
There are two different ways of judging the vaccines ’ effectiveness against mortality, either specifically 
deaths related to COVID-19, or overall population mortality. One review of all-cause mortality withina 
small Mediterranean island nation between 2016 and 2021 found "a substantial increase of 9.7% in 
all-cause mortality in Cyprus in 2021 compared to 2020, with an overall mortality increase of 16.5% in 
2021 compared to the mean mortality of the previous five years." Specifically, they noted a “sharp 
increase" over the last half of 2021. In the conclusion of their analysis, authors ominous note that, 
”The substantial increase in mortality in Cyprus in 2021 is not entirely explained by COVID-19 deaths 
and is parallel to the concurrent vaccination campaign. This concerning observation should be 
comprehensively investigated by the National and European public health authorities to identijjl and 
address the underlying causes?“ 
A preprint meta analysis in the journal Lancet, consisting of multiple randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials showed an overall mortality benefit from adenovirus-based vaccines like the products from 1&1, 
AstraZeneca, and Sputnik, but not from mRNA vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna. Lancet 
researchers looked at studies of more than 122,000 adenoviral vector vaccine recipients and more than 
74,000 mRNA vaccine recipients total (each including a placebo / control group), and found that those who 
took an adenoviral vaccine saw an overall decrease in both Covid and cardiovascular death, with an 
overall average reduction of more than 60%. On the other hand, mRNA recipients did not show any 
statistically significant benefit in overall, cardiovascular, or COVID-related mortality.§ —5 These findings are 
supported by data from the UK Office of National Statistics [ONS) as wellﬁ 
To “throw light on the potential differences in nonspecific effects between vaccine types," Lancet 
researchers urged public health officials to conduct randomized-controlled trials "comparing the mRNA 
vaccines and adenovirus-vector vaccines for their effect on overall COVID-19 mortality as well as 
non-COVID-19 mortality." As of this writing, public health authorities in the US or UK have published no 
such study. 
The vaccines were recommended by state, national, and global public health authorities for nearly 
everyone, regardless of age or individual risk profile. In some jurisdictions, including Maine, officials 
achieved widespread adoption through coercion and state mandates ﬁi Even though many aspects of the 
COVID-19 vaccines were new, and even though the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) gave the 
manufacturers near-total legal immunity for any adverse reaction deemed to be caused by their products, 
state and public health officials cajoled millions to accept it. 
As of September 2022, more than two-thirds of the US population, and three-in-four Maine residents are 
considered “fully vaccinated,"§§ meaning having received at least two injections of an mRNA product, or 
one dose of the johnson & Johnson adenovirus-based product. Including boosters, mRNA accounts for 
more than 95% of all doses administered in the state??- 
The initial claim from government and public health officials that vaccination would protect against 
COVID-19 infection have been false for many months, following extensive analysis of patients in Israelm 
and Qatari-L in late 2021. Successive analysis of the period of Omicron variant prevalence published in The 
New Englandjournal ofMedicine (NE]M] provided further confirmation that the COVID-19 vaccines cannot 
be relied on to prevent infection?
12
The Maine CDC repeatedly refused to grant exemptions for COVID-19 vaccination requirements based on 
immunity from previous infection, even though science has clearly shown that the vaccines are less 
durable and less protective than "natural immunity." In one study published in NEJM by Goldberg et al. 
showed at four to six months, and at six to eight months from last dose, the patients who had been 
previously infected and unvaccinated had 80% fewer cases than the uninfected and vaccinated cohort. 
Those who had been previously infected and had one dose had about the same case rates as the 
unvaccinated cohort? - 
If the vaccines are not effective against infection, as the public was told, is it reasonable to critique 
effectiveness against severe outcomes like hospitalization and death? The limited, real-world dataset 
provided by Maine CDC regarding "breakthrough" COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths show 
that, between March 2022 and September 2022, "fully vaccinated" Mainers—those who received an initial 
series of COVID-19 vaccine products —made up about 73% of COVID-related hospitalizations and 
deaths.E This is not far off from the 76% of the population who is fully vaccinated. Given the prevailing 
narrative around COVID-19 vaccination, one would expect to see this data favor the vaccinated. Instead, it 
shows a negligible difference. 
It is important to note certain caveats when interpreting this data. For instance, it is more likely that 
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are elderly, who are also more likely to be vaccinated. But, it is also 
more likely that vaccinated people engage in fewer risk behaviors, and thus may be healthier in general, 
despite other risk factors such as age?-F‘ More comprehensive analysis of breakthrough data to account for 
confounding demographic factors is not possible given the limits Maine CDC has imposed on its own 
public data releases. 
Excess mortality increased from 2020 to 2021, not only in Maine, but nationally as well. A preliminary 
review of the evidence indicates that the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 failed asa 
strategy to stem premature death as a result of the pandemic. If the vaccines work, why didn't they? 
Regrettably, US government regulatory and scientific agencies have repeatedly given the public cause to 
doubt their honesty and integrity. In February 2022, The New York Times reported that the CDC had been 
withholding and obfuscating critical information on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine "booster" doses 
for middle-age and younger Americans related to COVID-19 hospitalizationsié 
Following this revelation, Dr. Marty Makary raised an alarm in an April 2022 Wall Street journal op-ed, 
accusing the FDA of cutting corners in order to recommend a second COVID-19 vaccine booster dose to all 
American adults age 50 or older, a fourth mRNA dose for many Americans? Makary noted that this led to 
the resignation of Marion Gruber, former director of the Office of Vaccine Research and Review, along with 
her deputy, Philip Krause, who both sat on the FDA advisory committee regarding vaccines and other 
related products. “ They were concerned with undue influence from political forces, expressing their 
skepticism for the recommendation in an article in The Lancet, that “If unnecessary boosting causes 
significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 
vaccines. Thus, widespread boosting should be undertaken only if there is clear evidence that it is 
appropriate. ” -7-‘3
/
13
Perhaps the near-universal recommendation of multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine deserves more 
scrutiny from independent scientists. Dr. Makary and researcher Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg wrote in ]uly 2022 
that the authorization of these products for children as young as six months old was “based on extremely 
weak, inconclusive datafﬁ They note that, “Pfizer reported a range of vaccine efficacy so wide that no 
conclusion could be inferred. N o reputable medical journal would accept such sloppy and incomplete 
results with such a small sample size."5‘*‘ Especially for an age group facing such low risks from SARS-CoV-2 
infection, public health officials must have very high confidence in the safety of such products, confidence 
which cannot be reasonably derived from currently available data. 
Government officials had early knowledge that safety and efficacy could be an issue with these new 
vaccines, yet they pressed ahead. They refused to take deep dive into reported adverse event signals, and 
refused to incorporate evidence of significantly waning vaccine efficacy into their guidance until August 
2022. Instead, the White House and CDC continued to push and authorize additional doses for younger 
and younger age groups throughout 2021 and most of 2022, while state officials doubled-down on their 
own vaccine mandates. 
In August, the US CDC updated its guidance on the coronavirus to recommend against testing people 
without symptoms, eliminate the "test-to-stay" strategy which kept children out of school for many days 
longer than necessary, and to declare that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals should be treated the 
same. In this update, CDC recognized both the efficacy of naturally-acquired immunity against infection, as 
well as the COVID-19 vaccines ’ inability to prevent infection or transmission. This update was significant, 
but issued much too late. The ill effects of persistent isolation, sustained public anxiety, and keeping 
children out of school for a virus for which very few face serious risk have already been wrought. 
All in all, a review of data, official reports, and the medical literature shows that the COVID-19 vaccines 
were not as effective as the public was told they would be. Health officials had no way of knowing 
real-world effectiveness, whether they would stop transmission in the way traditional vaccines do, or 
whether they would actually save lives, yet pressed on with various mandates to ensure adherence to this 
story. The spike in excess mortality over the course of 2021, while the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 
were presumably becoming less severe, leaves many questions unanswered, but ultimately casts doubt on 
the veracity of the narrative from state leaders like Dr. Shah and Gov. Mills.
14
STATE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
After reviewing the data available, several jurisdictions currently are not recommending COVID-19 
vaccination for certain populations. For instance, the state of Florida recommends against healthy 
children receiving it,32- a UK scientific advisory panel did not recommend the shots for healthy children 
aged 15 or youngerf ﬁ and the authorities in the European nations of Denmark“ and Norwayﬁ do not 
recommend COVID-19 vaccination for their citizens under age 50 and 65, respectively. Given these 
developments, Maine state officials should consider rescinding the recommendation of COVID-19 
vaccination for children and healthy adults as well. 
The Maine CDC should immediately rescind its rule requiring healthcare workers to be "fully vaccinated" 
for COVID-19 in order to work in “designated health care facilities."§ ‘=’ By issuing this rule, Gov. Mills forced 
hundreds of health, medical, and emergency workers out of their jobs, at a time when Mainers spend 
nearly $1,000 more on health care than the average Americanfiz Much peer-reviewed science has shown 
mandatory COVID-19 vaccination carries no benefit to overall public health precisely because it does not 
confer sterilizing immunity, that which is protective against infection or transmission. Despite this fact, Dr. 
Shah repeatedly compared the COVID-19 vaccines to other sterilizing vaccines like those for polio and 
smallpox, but both the smallpoxw and polioﬁi viruses do not have any animal reservoirs. Unlike 
SARS-CoV-2, they are only carried by humans.3§ 
Contrary to the latest CDC guidance, the Maine CDC rule treats vaccinated workers differently than 
unvaccinated workers. Despite this, a spokesperson for Maine DHHS responded to an inquiry from 
WMTW reporter Chris Costa that “the new [CDC] guidance is consistent" with its vaccine requirement for 
healthcare workers?-1 Without providing any reasoning behind this assertion, DHHS lied to Maine people 
in order for the administration to avoid responsibility for its failed vaccine mandate. 
The Mills administration and Maine Department of Education must also make clear to the University of 
Maine System91 and the Maine Community College System” that they must rescind COVID-19 vaccine 
mandates for students to pursue higher education in the state. Many in that age group likely carry some 
immunity from previous infection, which additionally protects them and others against severe outcomes 
from COVID-19. As a recent preprint paper outlined, the risk-benefit analysis for young, healthy people 
shows that vaccination is unnecessary at best and potentially harmful at worst.5‘i 
On October 20, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of which Maine CDC Director 
Nirav Shah is a member, unanimously voted to add COVID-19 vaccines to the recommended schedule of 
childhood immunizationsf ﬁ Many states look to this list as a benchmark for their own schedule of 
vaccinations mandated for public school students. Despite Shah's support for it, DHHS, DOE, and state 
legislators should resist attempts to add these investigational products to Maine's immunization 
schedule? “ 
Finally, the Maine Legislature should pass a bill amending the powers of the governor in a state of 
emergency by requiring an affirmative vote of a majority of legislators every 14 days, and allow for 
legislative revision and scrutiny of the governor's emergency orders. Emergencies do not last for 15 
months. Rules like this could have softened the blow of single-person rule, which led to months of harmful 
restrictions and lockdowns pushed by the governor.
15
CONCLUSION 
Media, public health officials, politicians, and most Americans have been consumed by the specter of 
death from/with COVID-19 for more than two years. This led to a singular-focused response, blind to the 
reality of unintended consequences. Leaders pushed never-before-tried policies and experimental 
products on their citizens pursuant to the myopic obsession of a new respiratory disease, even years after 
its discovery. During this time, America experienced its deadliest two-year period in 100 years, including 
its “deadliest year ever" in 2021. 
Sadly, provisional data show heightened all-cause mortality persisted during the first half of 2022. 
Although statewide mortality was down about 25%, a jaw-dropping 60% more Mainers between ages 25 
and 44 died compared to the pre-pandemic average. 
Little doubt remains that lockdowns had their own contribution to all-cause mortality, either through 
delayed health screenings leading to prolonged illness, or increased isolation leading to greater deaths of 
despair—as evidenced by an inﬂamed drug overdose crisis which is worse than it's ever been. Assuming 
that all drug overdose-related fatalities in Maine occurred among those between ages 15 and 64- , drug 
deaths accounted for more than 90% of the excess deaths among that group in 2020, and more than 50% 
in 2021. 
In late March 2020, Gov. Mills was warned by some close advisors of some potential detrimental effects of 
her stay-at-home order. As reported in a Bangor Daily News article, emails uncovered from a Freedom of 
Access Act (FOAA) request show Peter Mills, Executive Director of the Maine Turnpike Authority —and the 
governor's brother—expressed skepticism to the type of shutdowns many governors were enacting 
around the country, including in Maine. "Shelter in place is an unenforceable meat axe remedy best 
reserved for active shooter situations," he wrote to the governor on March 24, 20203 In hindsight, this 
advice was among the best Gov. Mills received from her inner circle. It was grounded in reality and human 
nature, not twisted, fearful pandemic thinking. Too bad that she did not take it seriously. 
While the initial effects of the shutdowns would have been devastating on their own, continuing the ethos 
of social distancing and constant fear of others will likely prove to be the most destructive. The data bear 
this out. This analysis shows that excess deaths from drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and failure of the 
circulatory system and endrocrine system accounted for more than one-third of Maine's overall excess 
mortality over 2020 and 2021. While these deaths may be seen by some as a “result of the pandemic, ” they 
were not a result of viral infection, but more likely the unintended costs of lockdown policies. Maine Policy 
warned against the potential costs of the governor's response, but she didn't listen?’-Q 
In an era of marked by historic levels of public mismanagement and incompetence contributing to 
"America ’s deadliest year ever,” the public must demand scrutiny from all levels of government. Public 
health officials must allow for independent review of their agencies ’ actions, processes, incentives, and 
culture if they wish to regain the public's trust, which they so carelessly lost over the last two-and-a-half 
years.
