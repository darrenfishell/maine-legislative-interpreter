Memorandum of Support

To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Health and Human Services  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1382 
Public Hearing An Act to Establish the Guiding Public Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of 
a Highly Infectious Respiratory Disease 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1382 
Public Hearing An Act to Establish the Guiding Public Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of 
a Highly Infectious Respiratory Disease 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell, and I'm from Sanford. 
 
As you may be aware, the COVID vaccine has been shown to not provide immunity to COVID or provide any 
significant benefit. Studies are also showing other negative side effects such as increased rates of myocarditis, 
and other uncommon conditions.  
 
Maine needs to have guidelines for focused protection when it comes to infectious diseases. Heathcare workers 
were fired at a time where they were critically needed. Churches and schools were closed and we are now 
facing an epidemic of mental health issues.  
 
Please support this bill as we need principles and protections in place.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
