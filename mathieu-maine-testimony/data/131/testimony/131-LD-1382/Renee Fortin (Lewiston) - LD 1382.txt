LD 1382
Dear Members of the HHS Committee,  
I am requesting "ought to pass" on LD 1382: "An Act to Establish the Guiding Public 
Health Principles of Focused Protection for Pandemics of a Highly Infectious 
Respiratory Disease"
This Act would overturn the wrongs listed below, that have been done to the people 
of Maine, actually ensuring justice, and a right way to do things.  
Here is what it would do: SUMMARY
This bill establishes principles of focused protection for a pandemic of a highly 
infectious respiratory disease for public health authorities to follow, including:
1. Considering the impact on overall public health instead of being focused on a 
single disease;
2. Weighing the short-term versus the long-term consequences of any public health 
measure;
3. Protecting vulnerable populations and not shifting the burden of protecting against 
the disease from the affluent to the less affluent;
4. Addressing the needs of various populations in the State, including considering 
places of worship essential;
5. Basing comparative risk evaluations, risk reductions and reduction of uncertainties 
on using the best available scientific evidence but recognizing that risk cannot be 
entirely eliminated;
6. Presenting facts as the basis for guidance and not employing fear, shame or 
falsehood to manipulate the public;
7. Not forcing medical interventions on a population, which must be voluntary and 
based upon informed consent rather than coercion; and
8. Being honest and transparent, giving fact-based and data-based advice and 
acknowledging errors or changed evidence
Please also see,  Articles 1 and 3 of our Maine Constitution, we have been violated 
long enough! 
Again, please vote "ought to pass" on LD 1382
