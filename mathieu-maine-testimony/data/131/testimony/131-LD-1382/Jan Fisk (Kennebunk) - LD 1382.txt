At a time when we are all coming out of the cold winter months to enjoy the outdoors and mingle with 
friends, family and visitors to our beautiful state, why would some of our elected officials be promoting 
the idea that Maine is somehow immune to communicable diseases?  With 95% of the state’s population 
having received at least one dose of the COVID 19 vaccine, 82% fully vaccinated, and almost half of our 
population having received the booster, lawmakers would give the impression that we are out of the 
woods.  Because of the leadership of Nirav Shah and Anthony Fauci and the tireless work of our nation’s 
doctors, researchers, and healthcare workers, we were able to make intelligent decisions to mask up, 
isolate and vaccinate.  I believe these proposed bills currently under consideration will undermine the 
Maine’s stellar response to the pandemic and confuse the population into a false sense of security, that 
the COVID virus is no longer a threat.   
Specifically,  
• Will LD 1382  create public health principles that do not now exist?  Based on Maine’s successful 
response to the first national pandemic in 100 years, this bill appears to be redundant and may even 
sow unnecessary confusion or mistrust. Should there be another infectious pandemic, I want to 
believe the principles that guided us beginning in 2020 remain in place and improved, as needed.   
The threat remains.  VOTE NO.
