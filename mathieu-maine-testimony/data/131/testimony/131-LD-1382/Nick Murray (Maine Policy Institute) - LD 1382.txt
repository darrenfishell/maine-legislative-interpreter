Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1382:
“An
Act
to
Establish
the
Guiding
Public
Health
Principles
of
Focused
Protection
for
Pandemics
of
a
Highly
Infectious
Respiratory
Disease”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1382.
Public
health
policy,
like
scientific
understanding,
can
shift
significantly
over
time.
It
should
be
held
to
the
same
standard
of
accountability
that
we
demand
of
public
servants,
even
in
an
extended
emergency
situation.
This
is
why
officials
and
experts,
when
previously
discussing
the
efficacy
of
mass
society-wide
lockdowns
in
response
to
a
respiratory
virus
outbreak,
conclude
time
and
time
again
that
the
policy
would
be
more
destructive
than
the
disease.
In
2020,
we
threw
all
of
that
planning
and
foresight
out
the
window,
and
science
appeared
to
begin
from
square
one—the
dark
ages.
This
is
why
several
globally-recognized
and
esteemed
epidemiologists
were
moved
to
pen
the
Great
Barrington
Declaration
in
fall
of
2020,
and
lay
out
the
commonsense
disease-mitigation
principles
of
Focused
Protection.
1
These
brave
scientists
were
greatly
influenced
by
the
work
of
Dr.
Donald
A.
Henderson,
former
director
of
the
World
Health
Organization
effort
which
eradicated
smallpox
in
the
1970s.
In
2007,
Dr.
Henderson
co-authored
a
paper
in
response
to
a
recent
CDC
document,
initially
called
“Early,
Targeted,
Layered
Use
of
Nonpharmaceutical
Interventions,
which
touted
mass
lockdowns
as
a
response
to
an
influenza
pandemic
2
In
that
prescient
document,
Henderson
and
colleagues
cite
decades
of
disease
mitigation
precedent
which
vigorously
condemn
the
coercion-based
public
health
philosophy
that
leads
to
closed
schools,
mandatory
mass
quarantine,
and
a
general
shutdown
of
society.
They
close
with
this:

“Experience
has
shown
that
communities
faced
with
epidemics
or
other
adverse
events
respond
best
and
with
the
least
anxiety
when
the
normal
social
functioning
of
the
community
is
least
disrupted.
Strong
political
and
public
health
leadership
to
provide
reassurance
and
to
ensure
that
needed
medical
care
services
are
provided
are
critical
elements.
If
either
is
seen
to
be
less
than
optimal,
a
manageable
epidemic
could
move
toward
catastrophe.”

Lockdown
policy
is
truly
medieval.
It
is
an
affront
to
the
values
we
purport
to
exemplify
in
the
United
States
and
the
State
of
Maine,
whose
consequences
are
still
being
felt.
We
are
merely
beginning
to
account
for
the
staggering
loss
of
life
and
increase
in
morbidity,
especially
for
younger
populations
who
faced
very
low
health
risk
from
COVID-19,
over
2020
and
2021.

The
graph
below
shows
the
incredible
increase
in
mortality
from
drug-related
causes
for
Mainers
aged
25-49
in
2020;
5
there
is
little
doubt
that
draconian
lockdowns
played
a
role
in
inflaming
an
opioid
addiction
crisis
which
had
already
begun
to
spiral
out
of
control.

The
problem
with
the
ad-hoc,
reckless
“public
health”
policy
of
lockdowns,
restrictions,
and
mandates,
is
that
its
goals,
like
the
virus
it
tried
to
fight,
constantly
evolved.
It
was
never
based
on
sound
advice
on
how
to
maintain
positive
personal
health.
To
fight
a
respiratory
virus
that
was
more
likely
to
spread
indoors,
and
could
be
combated
by
maintaining
stable
health
by
exercising
and
vitamin
D
exposure,
the
state
government
forced
Mainers
to
stay
inside
their
homes,
and
even
mandated
face
coverings
in
“all
public
areas”
including
open
air,
outdoor
spaces,
6
for
over
a
year.
7
Today,
the
full
absurdity
of
these
policies
are
laid
bare.
Yet,
neither
Gov.
Mills
or
any
member
of
her
administration
has
admitted
that
lockdowns
were
a
grave
mistake,
and
on-balance,
caused
more
harm
to
public
health.
Because
the
governor
betrayed
the
public
trust
with
her
actions
during
the
pandemic,
this
Legislature
must
ensure
the
totalitarian
policies
of
2020
(and
2021)
never
happen
again.
Please
deem
LD
1382
“Ought
To
Pass.”
It
is
the
least
that
this
Legislature
or
the
state
government
can
do
to
apologize
to
Mainers
and
attempt
to
right
some
of
the
injustices
of
the
last
few
years.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
