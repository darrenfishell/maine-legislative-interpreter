Testimony in Support of LD 1797, An Act to Expand Maine's Health Care 
Workforce by Expanding Educational Opportunities and Providing Tax Credits 
May 2, 2023 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. My name is Bethany Miles 
and I am a rising 3"‘ year medical student at the University of New England College of 
Osteopathic Medicine (UNE COM). Thank you for considering this testimony in support of LD 
1797. 
I was born and raised in Maine where my family has lived for generations. Growing up, I was 
drawn to the healthcare field much like my mother, a pediatric nurse practitioner, and my aunt, 
a pharmacist with her own pharmacy in an underserved Maine community. As a Mainer I never 
considered it unusual to travel long distances for anything, especially healthcare services, but 
the implications of this became clearer to me as I grew into adulthood. Even today, my 
grandmother travels several hours to receive IVIG infusions and meet with her neurologist, and 
an hourjust to see her primary care provider. 
Before medical school, I was a registered nurse. I received my bachelor's degree from the 
University of Maine and I was excited to try and make a difference for the health of Maine 
people like my grandmother. While in nursing school, it was obvious to me that the "nursing 
shortage" being talked about was certainly not for lack of those wanting to be nurses, but 
rather the staff and resources to train them. Even in practice, the turnover of nurses was very 
high, especially during the pandemic, as people left to take on travel contracts for higher pay or 
even leave healthcare altogether. It was becoming harder to ”hold the line" , and I was 
compelled to do more for Maine people than I felt I could do as a nurse, so I applied to medical 
school. 
I applied to UNE COM because of its presence in Maine and the large number of brilliant 
physicians it provides for us. As a mother of three young children the support of being close to 
family during medical school was also paramount. At face value, it did not necessarily make 
financial sense to pursue this. In fact, I could probably write a thesis on all the hurdles and 
hardships I was told I would face being an older medical student with children. However, I 
believed enough in what I could accomplish for Maine people on the other side of this journey 
that I put my faith in the process, and that process is what made it possible for me. Resources 
like the Doctors for Maine's Future scholarship and Maine Health Professions Loan program 
have eased the financial burden such that I can afford to stay and practice in Maine. 
Furthermore, being guaranteed a Maine clinical site placement as part of my scholarship allows 
for me to begin my clinical training in the same area in which I intend to practice. 
I know there are many others out there, Mainers and Mainers-at-heart alike, that are more 
than willing to step up to serve the healthcare needs of our people if given the chance.
