Testimony ln Support: 
LD 1797 "An Act to Expand Maine's Health Care Workforce by Expanding Educational Opportunities and 
Providing Tax Credits" 
Joint Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancements and Business 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and honorable members of the Committee on innovation, 
Development, Economic Advancements and Business. My name is Laura Harper, l’m Senior Associate at 
Moose Ridge Associates and l live in Hallowell. I am testifying on behalf of my client, the Maine 
Association of Physician Assistants or MEAPA, in Support of LD 1797, with addendums for your 
consideration. 
Physician Assistants (PAs) along with our physician and nursing colleagues, recognize and feel the 
healthcare workforce shortages particularly in our rural communities. in 2020, LD 1§60, An Act to 
Increase Access to Physician Assistant Care, was signed into law to increase access to care throughout 
Maine where PAs frequently serve as primary care and emergency care providers in rural areas. This law 
ensures Maine PAs can practice at the height of their training, experience, and expertise, with optimal 
team practice. This law eliminates burdensome physician oversight and restrictions on collaboration with 
PAs. 
PAs at minimum are Master's degree educated, generalist trained medical practitioners, providing care in 
all areas of healthcare, from primary care settings, urgent care/emergency departments to medical and 
surgical specialties. In Maine, 45% of PAs are hospital based, while 40% are outpatient/clinic based. 
PAs complete at least 24 months of combined didactic and clinical training with over 2000 hours of 
clinical rotations. Exclusion of PAs from this bill will adversely affect the ability to provide clinical training 
for a signiﬁcant portion of our healthcare workforce in Maine and create inequity and inadvertent 
competition amongst training programs and clinical experiences of interprofessional colleagues. UNE, 
Maine's only PA Program focused on rural primary care, graduates approximately 50 students per year 
with 70% of them remaining in Maine to practice. Clinical rotations are a major recruiting tool for 
practices, particularly in rural areas. 
On a federal level, the PA workforce is growing exponentially; US News and World Report consistently list 
the PA profession in the top 5 professions, with projected 28% profession expansion by the year 2031. 
The intensity and efﬁciency of the PA training allows for a more rapid deployment, streamlining access to 
care issues.

With this in mind we propose the following language, 
Chapter 279, section 3. We recommend adding subsection, 
"F. Expanding rural primary care clinical rotations for graduate Physician Assistant students to support 
long-term professional practice in the rural parts of the state". 
Additionally, in the summary we propose adding the following language, 
Section 3. 
"it establishes the Maine Health Care Education Training and Medical Residency Fund and appropriates 
$4,885,000 annually to the fund to establish clinical training opportunities for 3" and 4"‘ year medical 
students and Physician Assistant Students in rural parts of the state." 
Thank you for your time and interest in solving this important issue facing rural Mainers, l’d be happy to 
answer any questions you may have.

Uncovering America‘s most valuable care: executive summary. This study looked at the best 
primary care practices in the country and put together a list of what makes them so good. Those 
practices that work closely with their PAs and ensured that PAs were able to work to the full 
extent of their education and experience ranked the highest.

This study found that patients with diabetes who received primary care services at VA facilities 
from a physician, an NP, or a PA over a two~year period saw no signiﬁcant variation in health 
outcomes. Authors conclude that ”similar chronic illness outcomes may be achieved by 
physicians, NPs, and PAs."
