WE CAN NOT take away concentrated cannabis product from the Maine medical 
marijuana patients. There are patients that have been smoking marijuana products for 
years and over that time build up an extremely high tolerance. The concentrated 
extract are an extreme benefit to these patients because it offers something that is 
higher thc for the people who need it. It is sad to see that there are people trying to get
in the way of a product that was voted in to be used medically and now they are trying
to step in and take that away. We can't turn our backs on the patients who need it most
so it shouldn't even be considered of taking it away.
