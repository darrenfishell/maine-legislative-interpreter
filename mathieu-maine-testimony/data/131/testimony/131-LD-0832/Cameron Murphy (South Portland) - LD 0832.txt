LD 832
Hi all, I am writing in regards to 'LD 832".
I want to start off by saying the fact that this has even been brought to a public 
hearing should respectfully be a joke. There are patients who have been using high 
dose concentrates for possibly decades, that would have their medicine program 
interrupted because of Adult Use Cannabis advocates and business owners trying to 
take more share of the Medicinal Market that has existed here in Maine for years.
I am an advocate for the adult use marijuana businesses and have a retail medical and 
adult use cannabis store both coming online in the coming months, and to think that 
our law makers and citizens have to waste their time even discussing this as an option 
makes me feel sick. Forget about the money, think about the patients, the real patients
who have used these types of medicines for decades, the thought of them having to 
pay the recreational price or go through a government operated medical card 
certification processes is a complete waste of tax payers money and time that our 
doctors and law makers have so little of already.
To make any of these suggested changes would be to take 10 steps back from 
everything the great state of Maine has accomplished and reached to date. We 
CANNOT let adult use advocates ruin the medical program for Maine, for our 
patients, for our provides, and for our state. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
