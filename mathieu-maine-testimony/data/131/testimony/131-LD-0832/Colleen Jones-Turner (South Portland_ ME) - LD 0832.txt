I have a medical condition that requires me to consume medical cannabis to treat my 
disease. My husband is currently using a cannabis treatment, along with his medical 
doctor to treat his colon cancer, with great results thus far. This bill will make it 
harder for people like us to procure our medicine, which, when you are struggling to 
stay alive, just adds another huge unnecessary stress onto a patient's or caregiver's 
already long list of things to do to bring comfort.
Please put patients first, I don't want to have to break the law to get the treatment I 
need to stay alive.
Thank you for your time.
