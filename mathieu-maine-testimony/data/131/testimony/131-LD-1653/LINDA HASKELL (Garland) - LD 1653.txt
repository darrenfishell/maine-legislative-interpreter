All Electors from Harassment and Intimidation Oppose LD1653
LINDA HASKELL, I strongly oppose this attempt give voting rights to the mentally 
ill. What is the next desperate attempt does the Democrat party try to slide into the 
Maine Constitution.Maine voters must be of sound mind and and have the ability to 
make understand the voting system and what they would be voting on and for. How 
dare the Democrats pull such underhanded deceptive Resolutions. Same on the bunch 
of you that Sponsor and Co-Sponsored this.
