LD 1040
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Health 
and Human Services Committee. I am here today to express my support of LD 1040: 
“An Act to Require Reimbursement for Gender-affirming Care for MaineCare 
Members.”
My name is Sloane Paul and I moved to Orono, Maine two years ago. 
I believe this care needs to be protected. Gender-affirming healthcare, which is 
supported by every major medical organization in the United States, is being targeted 
by a coordinated, national campaign that seeks to remove transgender Americans 
from public life. According to data from the 2021 Maine Transgender Community 
Survey, 27% of trans-Mainers are on MaineCare. This represents roughly 3 to 4 
thousand Mainers, about 70% of whom indicate they access gender-affirming care. 
As a Mainer, being able to be openly non-binary and find acceptance in my 
community is a huge part of my life. It’s important to be able to be proud of who I am
without fearing for my safety. While I am not actively seeking out gender-affirming 
care, I want to know that if I do in the future I will have affordable access to it. I fear 
for other trans and queer people in my community losing access to gender-affirming 
care. It’s as much of a right as any other health treatment and could greatly impact the
LGBTQ+ community. I love living here and I don’t want our state to end up like 
others with restrictions on gender-affirming care. 
Please support LD 1040 to require reimbursement for gender-affirming care for 
MaineCare members. Thank you for your time.
