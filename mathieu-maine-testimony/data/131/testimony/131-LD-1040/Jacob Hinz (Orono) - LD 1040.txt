LD 1040
Dear senator Baldacci, representative Meyer
And honorable members of the health and human services committee. I support LD 
1040 “an act to require Reimbursement for gender affirming care for MaineCare 
Members.”
Every major medical care Organization in the United States supports gender affirming
health care. As legislators you should be listening to what experts say about any issue,
obviously. Other states politicians have unfortunately deemed themselves to be more 
knowledgeable than the experts and passed legislation that attempts to remove the T 
part of lgbt from public life. Maine has this chance to stand out from the rest of our 
countries worst instincts by passing LD 1040.
Research shows that trans people experience hardships such as poverty at double the 
rate of other Americans. Reimbursement for gender affirming care is necessary to 
ensure that trans people can participate in our society without the fear of financial 
failure. With the current system we are essentially punishing people for seeking care 
that will help them function as productive members of society.
This bill represents an investment in people, by allowing trans folks to obtain care that
will help function and give more of themselves back to Maine.
