LD 1040
My name is Alex Wu and I am a member of the League of Women Voters Maine's 
Youth Council. My opinions are purely my own and not indicative of any of the 
opinions of the league. I am asking you to vote ought to pass on LD1040.
I believe that trans medical needs should be covered equally as any other medical 
need and not treating gender affirming care puts transgender people at risk.
Some people are privileged enough to have private insurance to cover their gender 
affirming medical care, but this privilege is not available to all. People that do not 
have private insurance and are also members of the transgender community may not 
have access to this medical care. This type of care is proven to be life saving.
Thank you for listening to me about my stance on LD1040, and I urge you to vote 
ought to pass.
