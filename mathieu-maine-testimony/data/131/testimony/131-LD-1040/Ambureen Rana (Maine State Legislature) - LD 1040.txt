Testimony of Representative Ambureen Rana supporting 
LD 1040, An Act to Require Reimbursement for Gender-affirming Care 
for MaineCare Members 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Ambureen Rana, andI 
represent House District 21, which includes a portion of Bangor. I am here before you today to 
present LD 1040, An Act to Require Reimbursement for Gender-af Ô¨Årming Care for 
MaineCare Members. 
LD 1040 prohibits the MaineCare program from discriminating in its reimbursement for 
medically necessary treatment on the basis of a MaineCare member's gender identity, gender 
expression or on the basis that the MaineCare member is a transgender individual and requires 
that the program cover medically necessary treatment for or related to gender dysphoria. 
In 2019, exclusions to transgender care for those enrolled in MaineCare were removed. Because 
of these changes, MaineCare policy is now in compliance with both state and federal law. This 
bill is simply putting into statute what has already been accomplished in 2019 to ensure that 
medically necessary care is provided, and the right to health care for those enrolled in MaineCare 
is not impeded. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
House District 2i: Parr of Bangor
