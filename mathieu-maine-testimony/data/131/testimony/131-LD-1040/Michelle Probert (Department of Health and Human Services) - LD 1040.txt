Testimony of the Office of MaineCare Services 
Department of Health and Human Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
In Support of LD I040, An Act to Require Reimbursement for Gender-a ﬂirming Care for 
I 
_MaineCare Members 
Hearing Date: April 12, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Michelle Probert. I am the Director of the Ofﬁce of 
MaineCare Services. I am here today to speak in support of LD 1040, An Act to Require 
Reimbursement for Gendeway ﬁrming Care for MaineCare Members. 
This bill prohibits the MaineCare program from discriminating in its reimbursement for 
medically necessary treatment on the basis of a MaineCare member's gender identity, gender 
expression, or on the basis that the MaineCare member is a transgender individual and requires 
that the program" cover medically necessary treatment for or related to gender dysphoria. 
In June 2019, MaineCare adopted an emergency rule to reverse the previous policy of non- 
coverage for services related to gender transition, to explicitly require reimbursement to 
providers for the provision of MaineCare-covered services prescribed by a medical professional 
in relation to gender dysphoria. Medical necessity of such services is to align with national 
standards, such as the Standards of Care of the World Professional. Association for Transgender 
Health. These changes align with the subsequent Health and Human Services announcement in 
May 2021 that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex under Section 1557 of the 
Affordable Care Act shall also apply to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 
gender identity. 
The legislation is needed to protect the coverage from future administrative changes on the state 
or federal level by requiring legislative approval to reverse it. 
I will be happy to answer any questions you have and will plan to attend the work session.
