LD 1040
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Health 
and Human Services Committee,
My name is Mackenzie Reynolds. I'm a sophomore in college at the University of 
Maine in Orono studying history. I am here today to express my support of LD 1040: 
"An Act to Require Reimbursement for Gender-affirming Care for MaineCare 
Members.‚Äù 
Gender-affirming healthcare, which is supported by every major medical organization
in the United States, is being targeted by a coordinated, national campaign that seeks 
to remove transgender Americans from public life. Essential, evidence-based, 
life-saving, and affirming care should not be subject to these attacks.
Trans Mainers on Mainecare are twice as likely to have an ongoing relationship with 
a mental health provider. Trans Mainers on Mainecare are half as likely to report 
interruptions in accessing their hormones, diabetes medicine, and psychiatric 
medicine. 
Trans rights are human rights, and securing and safeguarding these rights is very 
important to me as a young college student in the LGBTQ+ community with trans 
friends. 
Thank you for your time, 
Mackenzie Reynolds
