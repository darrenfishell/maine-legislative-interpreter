Good afternoon, 
Please accept this written testimony in opposition to LD1040. 
Let's start by clarifying that cutting off healthy breasts or genitals is not "care", it's 
abuse. Labeling it care does not make it less atrocious or wrong. People who truly 
have gender dysphoria should receive mental health services, not hormones and 
plastic surgery. This is abuse of people with mental illness. 
Therefore, no tax dollars, absolutely zero, should go towards this abuse. 
Thank you for your time.
