LD 995 - An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care 
Provider Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons 
Support 
LD 1404 - An Act Requiring Insurance Companies to Cover the Care of Expectant Mothers in 
Adoption Cases and Provide Notice of That Coverage to Pregnant Women 
Support 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health 
Coverage, insurance and Financial Services Committee: 
l\/ly name is Heather Sirocki. lam a member of the I\/laine Right to Life Committee anda 
resident of Scarborough. 
Requiring health insurance carriers to cover the cost of an additional opinion before any 
procedures or treatment that involves the possibility of terminating the life of another 
being is ethical and logical." 
Thus, I urge support for LD 995. 
We all know that health care and health insurance is expensive. 
We also know that prenatal care helps babies begin life with a strong start, and we know 
that mothers may encounter unexpected health events during pregnancy and delivery. 
And we know many people seek out babies to adopt. 
it is sad to think a pregnant woman may decide to abort their child due to concerns 
regarding access to healthcare. 
lt makes sense to allow adoptive parents the ability to temporarily include a birth 
mother on their policies before, during, and after the delivery. 
With stagnant population growth, l\/laine has been the oldest state in the nation for 
many years running. 
According to the l\/laine CDC, l\/laine women abort, on average, 5 babies per day or 150 
babies per month. That is about 1,900 babies per year. 
This common sense bill could help encourage more pregnant women to choose 
adoption for their babies. 
l urge support of LD 1404.
