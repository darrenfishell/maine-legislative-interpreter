Meredith Kerr
North Yarmouth
LD 995
Insurance Coverage for second opinion, LD 995
Position: Support
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is Meredith Kerr, from North Yarmouth,
ME. I come before you today to speak in Support LD 995.
 
I am a retired grandmother who fears for the next generation regarding their 
understanding of the sacredness of life. Every consideration should be available to 
pregnant women who face an unwanted pregnancy, including the insurance coverage 
of a second opinion when a doctor has recommended abortion. This provision not 
only assures that thorough medical attention has been paid to the protection of the 
baby in utero, but it also sends the message to our children and grandchildren of the 
value our generation places on the unborn.  
 
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 995. Thank you!
