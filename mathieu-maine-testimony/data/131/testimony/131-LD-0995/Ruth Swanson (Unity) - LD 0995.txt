LD 995 . HP630 
An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for A Second 
opinion, If a health care provider recommends on an 
abortion for Health or safety Reasons ! 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of 
the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Services 
My name is Ruth Swanson I Reside in Unity, MeI 
come before you today to speak in support of LD 995 
When all of us have any Maj or Health problems , 
We get second opinions 
Common sense comes into play, Why wouldn't we 
totally support Insurance Coverage for second 
opinions especially important when lives are at stake! 
Legislators show that Maine cares about Life. 
I ask the Committee to Vote ought to pass LD 995. 
Thank you,
