LD 995
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance
and Financial Services Committee:
My name is Judy Icenogle from Winslow, Maine and I  SUPPORT LD 995.
Second opinions are so important, especially when concerning a recommendation to 
have an abortion for health or safety reasons by a health care provider.  Coverage for 
the cost of a second opinion (specifically when it involves the life of an unborn baby) 
should be provided in writing.by all health insurance carriers; just as it often is for 
most other major health concerns.
Sincere thanks for reading my email.  I urge you to vote "ought to pass"  on LD 995.
