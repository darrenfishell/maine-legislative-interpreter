Rob Poissant
Gorham 
LD 995
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee. My name is  Rob Poissant from  Gorham, ME. I 
come before you today to speak in Support LD 995.
 
This bill would require a health insurance carrier to provide costs of a second opinion 
and any additional testing by any provider of the enrolled choice if the enrollees 
provider has recommended an abortion. The reason for my seeking support for 
provision is that a second opinion is essential when a patient is making a significant 
life changing decision for a major health diagnosis. Abortion is a major health 
concern.  In my role as a volunteer Pastoral Ministry person with a Masters Certificate
in Pastoral ministry and in second current course in grief ministry which includes 
trauma, my experience in helping some minors who have had an abortion is that they 
are devastated with the decision they made and the lack of assistance by the provider 
after having an abortion. Those of us who provide guidance and assist them to find 
help and overcome the devastating harm and hurt they experience, recognize that they
would much better be helped if they were provided with a second opinion and any 
testing which would allow them to make a fully informed decision  especially when it 
comes to their lives and life of an unborn baby.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to pass on LD 995.
