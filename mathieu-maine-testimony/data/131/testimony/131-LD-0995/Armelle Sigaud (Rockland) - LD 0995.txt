LD 995
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance
and Financial Services Committee,
My name is Armelle Sigaud. I live in Rockland, Maine.
I am writing to you today in support of LD 995. 
If you were having surgery that could lead either to a continued, healthy life or to  
sudden death, would you be satisfied to consult with only one physician?
For most of us, the answer, obviously, is that we would not stop at one doctor. We 
would seek out the advice of several health professionals in order to have a better 
chance at survival. 
Then, after gathering additional information, we would feel better equipped to make a
decision, having a better understanding of all the factors involved, the potential risks 
and side effects, etc. 
Health insurance plans understand that this is what most patients desire. They wish to 
be in control of their own health.  Therefore, many health insurance plans cover 
second opinions for major health diagnoses. This is just common sense.
What LD 995 does is simply apply this principle to a major life-or-death decision 
called abortion. 
This bill would merely codify that such coverage for a second opinion would be made
available when it comes to the life of a preborn child. 
Does that not seem fair to you?   
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD 995.
Thank you.
