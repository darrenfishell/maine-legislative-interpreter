TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
LD 995 , HP 0630  
An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care Provider 
Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons  
 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee.   My name is Russell Brimmer, a 
resident and registered voter from Levant, ME.  I come before you today to 
speak in Support of LD 995 , An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second 
Opinion If a Healt h Care Provider Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety 
Reasons .   
 
We have heard a lot lately in the debate about a womanâ€™s choice on whether to 
abort the unborn child in her womb.  It is unfortunate that these choices can be 
guided by several factors  outside the direct control of the woman making that 
choice.  Having the necessary information is critical to making an informed 
decision.    
It is a common and well -established practice for anyone facing a major health 
choice to obtain a second medical opinion, with any needed additional testing, 
before proceeding.  Pat ients deserve to be fully informed about their situation 
before they make a significant medical decision, especially it involves life or 
death issues.  LD 995 would require that this common practice be extended to 
cases where a medical provider has recommended an abortion due to the health 
and safety of an enrollee or a fetus , and  it would appropriately place the 
financial burden on the health insurance carrier .   
We all deserve to be as well -informed as possible about the medical decisions 
we make.  LD 995 is a common -sense approach to providing necessary 
information at the time i t is critically needed.  It is a reasonable and necessary 
step in this regard.  I encourage you to support LD 995.
