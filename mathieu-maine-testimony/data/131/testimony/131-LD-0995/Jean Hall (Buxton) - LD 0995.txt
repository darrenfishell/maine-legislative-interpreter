Jean Hall
Buxton
LD 995
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and Members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services Committee:
My name is Jean Hall from Buxton, ME.  I ask you to support LD 995, HP0630.
As a retired nurse after 44 years advocating for my patients/clients health and welfare,
I can honestly say a second opinion with any major health concern makes complete 
sense when lives are at stake.  Many health plans already cover second opinions for 
major health diagnoses.  This bill would just require that coverage for a second 
opinion will be available when it comes to the life of an unborn baby.  
Please know the life of the unborn baby and the health of the mother are precious.  
For these reasons I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 995, HP0630.  
Thank You!
Respectfully,
Jean Rioux Hall, RN, BSN
Buxton, ME
