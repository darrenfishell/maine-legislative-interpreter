Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services.  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am here to testify in support of L.D. 995, An Act to 
Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care Provider Recommends an 
Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons. 
 
I think all of us understands the value of a second opinion. Requiring a health insurance carrier 
to provide coverage for a second opinion after an enrolleeâ€™s provider has recommended an 
abortion due to the health or safety of the mother or unborn baby is simply common sense. The 
medical field has a tremendous responsibility when lives are at stake, including unborn babies. 
This bill simply codifies the availability of coverage for a second opinion when it is warranted.  
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Out to Pass on L.D.995. Thank you for allowing me to 
contribute my testimony.
