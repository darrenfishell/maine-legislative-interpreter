LD 995
It is my hope the 131st Legislative for the great State of Maine will voice a “yes vote”
for the passage of LD 995. My purely personal reason that I sent written testimony for
LD 995 is because I cherish maintaining life and a God gifted soul at all stages of 
human existence from conception with unique DNA through fertilization to fetus 
development for a special Lord God’s mission in life starting from in the womb. 
Biblical Scripture in Luke 1;31-32 (NAB version) says: “Behold, you will conceive in
your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.  He will be great and will 
be called son of the Most High…”
The State governments like Texas and Wisconsin are using the six weeks fetus 
heartbeat law. However, six weeks is much too long for a fetus heartbeat legislation in
any State of the United States (USA).  Also, any person even medical doctors with 
white jackets that states life does not initiate at conception is lying to force their 
unjust and ungodly paid political agenda. Maine needs to use 18-21 days or earlier for
their fetus heartbeat law to prohibit abortions. The following is a video showing 
clearly a 4-week fetus with a red heart beating 113 beats per minute and with major 
brain development:

A 4-week fetus is thus proven to be considered a living person and the fetus’ right to 
life would be guaranteed by the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  The 
mother is obligated to keep the fetus alive, take care of it, and protect it in the womb.  
Prolife means being in support of the lives of both the child and mother.
Any individual person should not be forced, against their will, to undergo an abortion 
by any means. God provides us with free will and it is common sense that all aborted 
babies’ living souls and spirits go straight to heaven. Parents should also provide 
proper guidance on medical and moral issues to their children. Let us hope all 
Legislators have a belief in a living God and they do not choose to play God’s role 
themselves with Maine Laws.  There are also two million couples wanting and 
waiting to adopt a child.  
Videos providing actual flicker sounds of fetus heartbeats 5-6 weeks of pregnancy are
as follows:

Human being life starts at conception because growth begins to a unique and 
unrepeatable person or person different from any other person of the 7½ billion 
people in the world. Where growth occurs, there is life. Unfortunately, most people 
desire some reliable measurement and visible proof of human life in order to voice 
that it has legal significance.  Half of all Americans believe an unborn child in the 
womb should not be aborted once a heartbeat is detected.  Article found in the 
September 2, 2021 issue of USA TODAY states this fact:

In fact, the Holy Bible provides God’s view that the unborn child in the womb shows 
life the very minute blood is flowing through a detected heartbeat.  Leviticus 17:11 
says: “Since the life of a living body is in its blood ….” (NAB version).
When can you hear the fetus heartbeat for the first time? The unborn child’s heart 
starts to beat as early as the 18-21 days of pregnancy. This is when the first sign of a 
developing embryo called a fetal pole is visible.
