Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Services Committee.  
My name is Andy Levesque I’m a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life. 
To begin, On Monday May 1st, this Capital experienced a historic show of pro-life Mainers gathered 
here opposing LD1619 which would terminate the life of a baby at the time of birth. 
I hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainers do not 
support the Governor’s Bill to kill our newborns. 
Today I am testifying in support of LD995. 
A second opinion is common sense with any major health concern and is especially important when 
lives are at stake.  
Many health insurance plans already cover second opinions for major health diagnoses.  
This bill would just codify that coverage for a second opinion and would be available when it comes to 
saving the life of an unborn baby. 
I urge you to vote for LD 995 
Thank You,
