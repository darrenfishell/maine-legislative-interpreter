To ask for and receive a second opinion on any type of surgery  provides for a better 
informed decision.  Health Care providers are human beings who can see things 
differently, or one might know of another way to solve the issue.  Abortion is an 
elective surgery which might  be able to be avoided.  Receiving a second opinion, 
places the best interest of the patient a priority.   Additional test and alternatives to 
abortion for which should be paid.   Health Insurance companies should pay for the 
second .
Often when someone visits her healthcare provider all of the information isn’t 
remembered.  Having the legal information about a second opinion given in writing 
ensure good communication between the provider and the patient.  
Many health insurance plans cover second opinions for major health diagnoses.  
Adding a second opinion for an abortion to the coverage shouldn’t be an issue.  
A second opinion may offer alternatives to abortion the first healthcare provider 
hadn’t considered.     A second opinion can be easily added to insurance plans 
because many already cover a major health diagnose.  Giving the patient material 
regarding a second opinion  in writing ensures good communication between 
healthcare provider and patient.  Please vote Ought to Pass on LD 995.
Thank you
