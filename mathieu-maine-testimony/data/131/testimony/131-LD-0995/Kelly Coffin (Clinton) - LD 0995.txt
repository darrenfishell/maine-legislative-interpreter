LD 995
Honorable members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
committee, 
My name is Kelly Coffin from Clinton.  Please vote ought to pass on LD 995. Since 
making such an important and life altering decision as an abortion it is only common 
sense and right to allow a second opinion. Doctors are human and fallible. I have 
heard several personal stories of women told they needed an abortion for health and 
safety reasons who didn't take that advice and everything turned out fine. So the 
original medical advice proved wrong. A second opinion is reasonable. It is my 
opinion that it should also be covered by insurance.
