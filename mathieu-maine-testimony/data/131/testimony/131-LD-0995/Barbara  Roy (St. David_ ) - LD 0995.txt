I support LD995 HP630 because A second opinion is common sense with any major 
health concern, and is especially important in a case when lives are at stake. This is 
already done for other major healthcare diagnoses. This bill would just make sure that
the same would be done when it comes to the life of the unborn baby. Thank you.
