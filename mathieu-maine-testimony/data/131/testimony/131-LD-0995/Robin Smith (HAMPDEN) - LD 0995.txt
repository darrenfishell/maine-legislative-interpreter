LD 995   Robin Smith   May 8th
Good Morning again, dear fellow-Mainers!
  Thank you so much for your work and involvement.
 I think LD 995 is a good idea. Where abortion is advocated, there should always be a 
second opinion, and I'm sure the patient would be gratified to hear that it was not 
necessary and that she had financial coverage as well for the second office visit.  I 
heartily appreciate your work in trying to approve this bill for passage.
