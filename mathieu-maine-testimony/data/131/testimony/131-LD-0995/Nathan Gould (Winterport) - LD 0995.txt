Testimony in Support of LD 995
An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care Provider Recommends
an Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services :
My name is Nathan Gould, and I live in Winterport. I am writing this testimony in support of LD
995, “An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care Provider 
Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons.”
I have relatives whose lives were saved by a second opinion. The importance of a second 
opinion can be no better demonstrated than when a woman is faced with making the life-altering—
life-ending—choice to have an abortion. It is only fair that a woman be fully informed before she gives 
her consent to such drastic measures.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
