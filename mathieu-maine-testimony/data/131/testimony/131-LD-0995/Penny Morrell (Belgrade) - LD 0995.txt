Senator Bailey Representative Perry, and members of the Health Coverage, 
Insurance & Financial Services Committee (HCIFS), thank you for the opportunity 
to present before you today. 
l'm Penny Morrell, from Belgrade and am in favor of LD L.D. 995, ‚ÄùAn Act to 
Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion If a Health Care Provider 
Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety Reasons." 
First, l want to thank Rep. Quint for sponsoring this bill. 
If an abortion is one option for a medical issue, L.D. 995 requires insurance 
companies to allow a woman to get a second opinion with a maternal health care 
provider of her choice. The woman is not required to get a second opinion. it 
requires the health care provider to tell her she has the right to a second opinion. 
Along with the second opinion, she has the right to diagnostic procedures froma 
maternal health care provider she chooses. In other words, she's allowed to see 
any maternal health care provider she wants and get any diagnostics. 
Please vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 995. Thank you!
