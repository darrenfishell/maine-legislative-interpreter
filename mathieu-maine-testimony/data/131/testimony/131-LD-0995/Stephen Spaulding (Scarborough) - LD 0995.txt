LD 995, HP0630  An Act to Provide Insurance Coverage for a Second Opinion 
If a Health Care Provider Recommends an Abortion for Health or Safety 
Reasons - 
Position:  Support 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary 
Committee. My name is Stephen A. Spaulding MD, from Scarborough, ME. I 
come before you today to speak in Support of LD 995.  
LD 995 mandates that health insurance providers must cover the cost of a second 
opinion and any additional testing sought by the patient after their healthcare 
provider recommends an abortion due to health or safety concerns for either 
the patient or her unborn child. The bill also requires healthcare professionals to 
inform patients of their right to a second opinion and the availability of health 
insurance coverage for it. Obtaining a second opinion is common practice in 
major health diagnoses, and it is especially crucial when the lives of both the 
patient and the fetus are at stake. Moreover, many health insurance policies already 
provide coverage for second opinions, and this bill would merely codify that such 
coverage is available in the case of abortion-related decisions. 
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 995. Thank 
you!
