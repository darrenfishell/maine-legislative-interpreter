_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony neither for nor against  LD 1 425 on behalf of the Maine Municipal 
Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC 
provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
The LPC will be discussing LD 1 425 at their next meeting scheduled for tomorrow, April 11 and 
have yet to take a position. MMA will plan to submit additional testimony based on the outcome of that 
discussion in advance of the work session. Thank you for your time and fo r considering the municipal 
perspective on this issue.
