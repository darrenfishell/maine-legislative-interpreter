Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1425:
“An
Act
to
Strengthen
Freedom
of
Access
Protections
by
Allowing
Remote
Meetings
to
Be
Recorded”
Senator
Carney,
Representative
Moonen,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Judiciary,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1425.
This
bill
is
a
commonsense
public
transparency
measure;
it
would
impose
a
basic
requirement
of
public
officials
so
that
the
people
may
check
the
record
of
actions
pursued
in
their
name.
LD
1425
merely
requires
that
public
bodies
must
record
and
publish
their
meetings
on
the
same
platform
used
to
conduct
the
meeting,
as
long
as
doing
so
does
not
incur
additional
costs
on
the
committee
or
other
public
body.
Many
of
these
bodies
still
conduct
their
meetings
via
Zoom,
a
platform
with
an
easily-used
recording
feature.
Several
other
types
of
video
conferencing
software
also
offer
this.
This
rule
governing
public
transparency
should
be
enacted
posthaste,
for
the
benefit
of
Maine
citizens;
there
is
no
excuse
for
this
bill
to
fail.
Please
deem
LD
1425
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
continue
this
work
to
strengthen
FOAA
and
public
access.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
