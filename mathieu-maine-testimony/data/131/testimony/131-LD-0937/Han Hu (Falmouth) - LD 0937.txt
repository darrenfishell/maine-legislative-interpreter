Testimony LD 937 
Dear Senator, 
I am writing to you today to advocate for legislation that would create a pathway forward for 
foreign~trained physicians seeking Iicensure in Maine. As a healthcare professional, I strongly 
believe that Maine can beneﬁt from attracting and retaining talented physicians from around 
the world to contribute to the state's healthcare system and improve patient outcomes. 
I completed my medical education and training and have been a physician for 15 years in one 
of the top teaching hospitals in China. However, despite my extensive education, training, and 
practicing, I am currently unable to utilize my skills and knowledge to help patients in the 
United States. This is due to the complex and time-consuming process of obtaining Iicensure 
in this country, which often presents signiﬁcant barriers for foreign—trained physicians. Despite 
my passion and dedication to the ﬁeld of medicine, I am currently unable to contribute to the 
healthcare system in the way that I am trained and qualiﬁed to do so. This is a frustrating and 
discouraging experience, as I know that I have so much to offer as a healthcare provider but 
am prevented from doing so by the current system. _ 
Foreign-trained physicians face signiﬁcant challenges in obtaining Iicensure in the United 
States, including passing the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), 
completing a medical residency program, and obtaining certiﬁcation from the Educational 
Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). These requirements can be daunting for 
foreign-trained physicians who are not familiar with the US medical system and may face 
language and cultural barriers. 
However, with the right support and resources, foreign-trained physicians can successfully 
navigate this complex process and become valuable members of Maine's healthcare 
workforce. I strongly believe that the legislation would streamline the Iicensure process and 
provide support and resources for foreign-trained physicians, making it easier for them to 
obtain Iicensure in Maine and contribute to the state's healthcare system. 
I urge you to support this legislation and work with your colleagues to make Maine a more 
welcoming and supportive state for foreign-trained physicians. By doing so, we can improve 
access to quality healthcare for Maine residents and strengthen our healthcare system overall. 
Thank you for your consideration of this important issue. 
Sincerely, 
Han Hu, Falmouth
