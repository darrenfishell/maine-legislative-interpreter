Testimony in support of LD 937
“Resolve, to Establish the Commission Regarding For eign-trained Physicians Living in
Maine”
Senator Bailey , Representative Perry , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on
Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business:
I write to you on behalf of the City of Portland’ s Legislative/Nominating Committee in support
of LD 937, Resolve, to Establish the Commission Regarding Foreign-trained Physicians Living
in Maine.
While Maine faces a shortage of healthcare professionals, there are many foreign-trained
physicians living in our state who are unable to practice medicine due to barriers in the
licensure process. This represents a missed opportunity to address the shortage of healthcare
professionals, as well as a waste of valuable talent and expertise.
LD 937 would establish a commission that would study integrating foreign-trained physicians
living in the State and make recommendations for improving the licensure process for these
individuals. This would not only benefit these foreign-trained physicians but also improve
access to healthcare services for all Maine residents.
Portland’ s Legislative Committee ur ges you to support L.D. 937 and help ensure that Maine
can make the most of the valuable talent and expertise of foreign-trained physicians living in
the state.
Thank you for your consideration.
