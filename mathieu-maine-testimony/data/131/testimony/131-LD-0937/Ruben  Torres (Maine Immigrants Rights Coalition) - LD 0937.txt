LD 937
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and 
Financial Services, I am here to testify in support of L.D. 937 on behalf of the board 
and members of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition (MIRC), a coalition of more 
than 97 member organizations with a commitment to advancing and defending the 
rights of immigrants. Our mission is to improve the legal, social, and economic 
conditions experienced by Maine’s immigrants – enhancing their lives while 
strengthening Maine – through advocacy, information sharing, and collaboration both 
through and among our member organizations. We actively prioritize the voices, 
perspectives, and decision-making of New Mainer communities as we acknowledge 
the status quo of systems that consistently disadvantage them. MIRC envisions 
policies that will not exacerbate inequities across BIPOC groups, including divisions 
across the country of origin, socioeconomic status, state geography, language, and 
immigration status.
As we all know, Maine faces a shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in 
rural areas. According to a report from the University of New England, Maine has the 
third-oldest population in the country, with 20% of residents over the age of 65. This 
demographic trend is only expected to continue, increasing the demand for healthcare 
services in the state.
At the same time, many foreign-trained physicians are living in Maine who are unable
to practice medicine due to barriers in the licensure process. This represents a missed 
opportunity to address the shortage of healthcare professionals in the state, as well as 
a waste of valuable talent and expertise.
L.D. 937 would establish a commission to examine these barriers and make 
recommendations for improving the licensure process for foreign-trained physicians. 
This would not only benefit these individuals but also improve access to healthcare 
services for all Maine residents.
Furthermore, allowing foreign-trained physicians to practice in Maine could have 
significant economic benefits. According to a report from the Migration Policy 
Institute, immigrants make up a significant proportion of healthcare workers in the 
United States. In 2018, immigrants accounted for 17% of all healthcare workers, 
including 28% of physicians and 24% of dentists.
In conclusion, we urge you to support L.D. 937 and help ensure that Maine can make the 
most of the valuable talent and expertise of foreign-trained physicians living in the state. 
Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.
