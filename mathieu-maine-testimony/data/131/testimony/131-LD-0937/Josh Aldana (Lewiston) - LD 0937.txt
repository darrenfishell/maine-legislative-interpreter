Most excellent Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Sen/ices, my name is Jose Aldana and I am from Lewiston. l am writing in 
support of LD 937 a Resolve to Establish a Special Commission Regarding 
Foreign-Trained Physicians Living in Maine, due to all beneﬁts that it has for 
foreign-trained living in Maine. This legislation allows us, to incorporate into 
the health care workforce and show you: our skills, capacity and experience 
acquired in our countries. 
The Commission will consist of stakeholders including healthcare employers, 
immigrant advocates, workforce development, and licensing boards, gather 
information, and issue a report of recommendations. 
l’m from Cuba and I have been a practicing physician for 5 years. I came to 
US 9 months ago and my goal is become a doctor again or working close to 
that level, but it will be possible when all barriers be delete, this is the way to 
improve our personal develop and show you our knowledge and skills. 
l would glad if this legislation were approved, it help people like me to get 
our dreams and goals; and beneﬁts the community with more doctors. 
Thank you for including my comments on this important legislation, this 
would be a great opportunity for all foreign physicians living in Maine, to be 
able to contribute some of our skills to society. 
Sincerely, Jose Aldana, Lewiston-Maine
