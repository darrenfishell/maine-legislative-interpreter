Repr esentativ e
P er r y ,
and

of
the
joint

on
Health

and
Financial
Ser vices.
My
name
is
J ob y
Tho yalil
and
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
Maine
Business
Immigration
Coalition
(MeBIC)
in
suppor t
of
LD
937,
which
sets
up
a
commission
to
study
and
ad dr ess
the
challenges
faced
b y
f or eign-trained
doctors
who
ar e
her e
in
Maine
and
unable
to
practice .
MeBIC
is
Maine’ s
onl y
r esour ce
dedicated
to
pr o viding
inf ormation,
education
and
adv ocacy
on
immigration
and
r elated
issues
fr om
and
f or
the
business
and
economic
perspectiv e .
W e
kno w
that
immigrants
ar e
par t
of
the
solution
to
Maine’ s
shor t-
and
long-term
w orkf or ce
shor tages.
That
shor tage
is
v er y
significant
in
Maine’ s
healthcar e
sector .
W e
understand
fr om
con v ersations
with
Maine’ s
largest
F ederall y
Qualified
Health
Car e
pr o vider
that
40%
of
doctors
in
the
state
ar e
on
track
to
hit
r etir ement
age
b y
2030,
and
that
does
not
include
earl y
r etir ement
due
to
burnout.
Mor eo v er ,
the
acute
need
f or
mor e
doctors
in
Maine
is
r eflected
b y
action
tak en
earlier
this
month
b y
both
of
our
U .S.
Senators,
Collins
and
King,
who ,
along
with
a
bipar tisan
gr oup
of
their
colleagues,
r eintr oduced
the
Conrad

and
Ph ysician

to
ensur e
that
a

to
practice
medicine .

MeBIC
is
f ocused
on
ensuring
that
Maine
is
a
state
wher e
immigrants
can
succeed,
which
helps
our
econom y
succeed.
W e
suppor t
LD

because
it
is
designed
to
help
immigrant
doctors
succeed
in
their
chosen
pr of ession,
help
fill
a
vital
w orkf or ce
need
f or
healthcar e
pr o viders,
and
help
to
incr ease
health
car e
access
f or
underser v ed
populations
in
the
state .
W e
think
the
bill’ s
a ppr oach
to
cr eate
a
commission
is
thoughtful
and
will
allo w
f or
inf ormed,
and
deliberate

W e
