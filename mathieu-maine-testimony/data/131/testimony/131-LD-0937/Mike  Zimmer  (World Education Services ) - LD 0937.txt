World Education Services Statement of Support for LD 937 
World Education Services (WES) supports LD 937, which would address the state's growing health 
care workforce shortage by establishing a commission to advance the inclusion of internationally 
trained physicians living in Maine.  
WES is a non-profit social enterprise dedicated to helping international students, immigrants, and 
refugees achieve their educational and career goals in the United States and Canada. For more 
than 45 years, WES has set the standard of excellence in the field of international academic 
credential evaluation. Through WES Global Talent Bridge, the organization joins with institutional 
partners, community-based organizations, and policymakers to help immigrants and refugees 
who hold international credentials fully utilize their talents and education to achieve their 
academic and professional goals. Through its grantmaking, impact investing, and partnerships, 
the WES Mariam Assefa Fund seeks to advance economic and social inclusion for immigrants and 
refugees.  
The U.S. will face a deficit of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, including a shortage of between 
17,800 and 48,000 primary care physicians.1 According to data collected by the Health Resources 
and Service Administration, 82 geographic areas, population groups, and facilities in Maine were 
federally designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) in need of primary care health 
workers in December 2022.2  In addition, Maine ranked last out of all 50 states for patient 
satisfaction of physicians in a 2020 Patient Sentiment Report published by Healthgrades and the 
Medical Group Management Association (MGMA).3 
At the same time, Maine is home to more than 47,000 immigrants and asylum-seekers.4 
Immigrants and refugees are an integral part of the state workforce, with more than 28,000

immigrant workers contributing to the state’s workforce as of 2018.5 In the same year, immigrant-
led households contributed $437.7 million in federal taxes and $193.9 million in state and local 
taxes.6 According to the American Immigration Council, from 2015 to 2019, immigrants and 
refugees comprised 15.0 percent of Maine's physician workforce and 4.5 percent of the state's 
registered nurses.7 
Immigrants and refugees with a background in health care are well-positioned to help address 
employment gaps, offering in-demand skills and multilingual abilities. Their perspective and 
knowledge of different cultures is also an asset: Studies have found that patient outcomes 
improve when health care teams are more diverse.8 
LD 937 would help address the state’s health care shortage while promoting equitable career 
pathways for internationally trained immigrants and refugees. With a commission on 
internationally trained physicians, the state would make progress toward promoting a more 
diverse health workforce and ensuring access to quality care for all patients  in Maine.
