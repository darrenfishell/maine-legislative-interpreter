DEDE NDUNGI
BIDDEFORD
LD 937
My name is Dede Ndungi. I am an asylum seeker from from the Democratic Republic
of Congo. In my home country I was a physician. 
I have a Master in Public Health. I worked as a physician and public health 
professional for 18 years. I worked in a hospital as a generalist. I treated all patients 
requiring a range of treatments including surgery, gynecology, and internal medicine. 
As a public health doctor, I worked in epidemiological surveillance and I fought 
against many epidemics in my country such as Ebola, yellow fever, measles, polio, 
cholera and Covid 19. 
I would like to continue my work as a physician. I'm ready to do whatever training would help 
me to apply my skills in my new home.
If I were able to work as a doctor in this state, I would gladly move to a part of the state that 
was in need of my help.
