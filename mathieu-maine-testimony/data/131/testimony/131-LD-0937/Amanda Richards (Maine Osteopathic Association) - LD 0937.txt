Testimony of the  Maine O steopathic Association  
Before the Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services  
 
In Reference to:  
LD 937, Resolve, to Establish the Commission Regarding Foreign -trained  
Physicians Living in Maine  
Public Hearing: Tuesday, March 21, 2023 1:00 PM,Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distingu ished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approximately 40 0 
osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the Osteopathic 
profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education, advocacy and member 
services in order to ensure the availability of quality osteopathic health  care to the people of  this State.”  
 
The MOA is pleased  to provide  testimon y in support of LD 937 . As an organization, w e are supportive of fair 
pathways to licensure for foreig n-trained physicians. In fact, we were a co-spons or of the “Fulfilling Potential: 
Foreign Trained Physicians A Pathway Forward ” remote forum held earlier this year. So , this legislation  and its 
concepts are not new to us and we support and welcome the  creation of t he Commission Regarding Foreig n-
trained Physicians Living in Maine. As a medically underserved state, we know that Maine needs to make use of 
all the physicians we have and find wa ys to recruit additional physicians to provide  quality healthcare to our 
citizens.  
 
We are however  surprised to see that this bill as drafted does not include or account  for representation  from the 
Maine osteopathic physician  community in th e Commission.  
 
Roughly one  in five Maine Physicians is a  Doctor of  Osteopathic Medicine  or D.O . We would encourage the 
committee to consider a member seat representing the Bo ard of Osteopathic Licensure,  which license s all DOs in 
Maine  and/or the  Maine Osteopathic Association  to account for  representation  for our part of the  Maine physician 
community  given that a member  of the Board of Licensure in Me dicine and two members who represent the 
Maine Medical Association  are already accounted for in the mix .  
 
Further, we would suggest that Maine ’s medical school, and the largest supplier of Maine ’s physicians the  
University  of New Engla nd College  of Osteopathic Medicine, should also be considered as a member  or key 
stakeholder  for th is Commi ssion.  
 
We appreciate the opp ortunity to comment on LD 937 and would a sk that the committee pass this legislatio n after 
carefully considering Commissio n membership so that equitable  representation  from Maine ’s physician 
community is included.
