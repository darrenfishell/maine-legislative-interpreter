Dr. Annick Metoule’sTestimony to Maine State Legislature 
ln Support of LD 937 a Resolve to Establish a Special Commission 
Regarding Foreign-Trained Physicians Living in Maine 
Dear Committee Members, 
My name is Dr. Annick Metoule and I am testifying in support of LD 937 “A Resolve to Establish 
a Special Commission Regarding Foreign-Trained Physicians Living in Maine”. 
I support this bill because it would help foreign-trained physicians use their existing medical 
training, skills, and experience to serve Mainers without delay. 
ln 2012, l received my MD from the University of Health Sciences in Gabon, Africa and in 2017, 
l earned a masters in public health from the Nancy School of Public Health in France. l have 
nine years of experience working as a family physician and four years working for the Gabonese 
National Insurance Company as a medical adviser and an advocate for improving my country's 
health care standards. 
Fearing for my life, l ﬂed to the US in 2019 and settled in Maine. Since then, l have learned 
English, gotten my driver's license, earned my Dental Assistant Certiﬁcation, and now work asa 
dental assistant at the University of New England during the day while pursuing my Masters in 
Public Health at night. Oh, and l have gotten married, am raising two young boys, ages 2 and 
3, and am a member of my church’s choir. 
Being a dental assistant helps feed my family and gets me an employee discount on my 
masters classes, but my goal is to become a physician again. l have the training, experience, 
smarts, and drive. The only reason l’m not already serving patients is the licensing barriers I 
face. l’m working to overcome them. Your vote for LD937 would help. 
l thank you for this opportunity you gave me to share my story. l hope that Maine can make it 
easier for foreign-born doctors to serve the people of Maine. 
Sincerely, 
Annick Metoule
