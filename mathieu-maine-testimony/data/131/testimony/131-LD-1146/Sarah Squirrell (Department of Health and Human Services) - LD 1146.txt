Re: LD 1146 An Act to Authorize Certain Health Care Professionals to Prescribe Methadone 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services, 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on LD 1146, An Act to Authorize Certain Health 
Care Professionals to Prescribe Methadone. The Department would like to thank Senator 
Brakey and Representative Boyer for highlighting the need to expand access to medication, 
speciﬁcally methadone, for the treatment of an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). This letter, 
however, is in opposition of LD 1146 as it violates Federal DEA Law, Title 21, Chapter 2, Part 
1306 04 and 07 
LD 1146 seeks to allow certain healthcare professionals to prescribe methadone for the treatment 
of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Currently, in the State of Maine, methadone is provided under 
close supervision through a Certiﬁed Opioid Treatment Program (OTP). OTPs are required to 
follow federal requirements under Title 42 Ch. l , Subchapter A, Part 8 as well as, the 
requirements of an approved accreditation body, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA)/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), the Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Board of Pharmacy and the State of Maine, Division of 
Licensing and Certiﬁcation. 
Maine is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic which has resulted in public health, safety, 
and ﬁscal strains throughout the state. The State of Maine is committed to improving the health 
of its citizens and supports efforts that will effectively and efﬁciently improve the delivery of 
services that treat OUD. A medication such as methadone is an evidenced-based OUD treatment 
practice. According to SAMHSA best-practice, services through a Certiﬁed OTP requires the use 
of medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a “whole- 
patient” approach to treatment. 
OBH and the Department support increasing access to methadone to treat individuals with OUD 
and have worked to increase this access by aligning state regulations of OTPs with federal laws 
and increasing reimbursement rates for existing providers. Under the current administration the 
State has seen an increase in certiﬁed OTPs with two (2) new sites opening in 2022; currently 
there are 12 certiﬁed OTPs with a l3‘h begirming to provide services in April of 2023. Each of 
the 13 OTPs has the ability to serve between 500-800 individuals at full capacity. The average 
enrollment in Maine OTPs increased 8% in the second half of 2022 compared to the ﬁrst half.
While OBH supports the expansion of access to lifesaving medications, LD 1146 would violate 
federal law and could put prescribers and patients at risk. 
Sincerely, 
Sarah Squirrell
