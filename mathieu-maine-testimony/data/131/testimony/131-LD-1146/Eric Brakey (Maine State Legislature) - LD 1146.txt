Senator Eric Brakey 
LD 1146 “An Act to Authorize Certain Health Care 
Professionals to Prescribe Methadone" 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
Thursday, April 6, 2023 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance and Financial Sen/ices, thank you for your time and attention. l am 
Senator Eric Brakey of Androscoggin County, representing the people of Auburn, New 
Gloucester, Poland, and Durham. Today, l am here to present L.D. 1146 "An Act to 
Authorize Certain Health Care Professionals to Prescribe Methadone." 
There is no one-size-fits-all road to recovery for opioid addiction, but there are many 
success stories. 
According to the National Institute of Health, medication-assisted treatment, including 
methadone and buprenorphine (commonly known as “Suboxone"), has an 80% success 
rate. That means 80% of patients can resume living normal and productive lives. Take 
that away —— relying on counseling and rehabilitation alone -— and all but 20% relapse. 
With detox alone, all by 5% relapse. 
Medication-assisted treatment along with counseling are the difference between a 5% 
success rate and an 80% success rate. For many people, this may mean they needa 
maintenance drug, like methadone, for the rest of their lives. Should that mean the 
individual in recovery must go to a methadone clinic every single day for the rest of their 
Hves? 
And when that means waking up at 5:00 AM to stand outside in a line, hoping you got 
there early enough for one of limited spots (especially if you don't have control over your 
own transportation and you live in a rural area), is that really how every single day 
should begin for the rest of your life? When does normal life resume? How do you hold" 
down a job, raise a family, and reintegrate into a society when your whole daily 
schedule revolves around a methadone clinic? This permanent disruption literally 
means it is impossible to work a 9-5 job. 
Unlike suboxone, which can be administered through a primary care physician, 
methadone may only be dispensed in a clinic. l understand concerns about diversion
and concerns about abuse, but someone who has been in recovery for ten years is ina 
very different position than someone who has been in recovery for ten days. 
Further, recent research (conducted by researchers with the National Institute for Drug 
Abuse, the National institutes of Health, and the Centers of Disease Control and 
Prevention) found no statistical rise in overdose deaths from take-home methadone 
during a recent natural experiment. in a research letter published by the American 
Medical Association, they wrote: 
On March 16, 2020, to facilitate access to methadone treatment from 
opioid treatment programs (OTPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration allowed 
states to request blanket exceptions to provide up to 28 and 14 days of 
take-home methadone for stable and less stable patients, respectively; 
this signaled a shift in practice because most patients historically receive 
methadone daily from OTPs. 
...After March 2020, overdose deaths not involving methadone continued 
to increase... whereas methadone-involved overdose deaths remained 
stable. 
...Coupled with research demonstrating improved patient satisfaction, 
treatment access, and engagement from these policies, these findings can 
inform decisions about permanently expanding take-home methadone. 
This legislation seeks to build upon this base of evidence by creating a physician-based 
model for methadone, similar to what has already proven effective in the dispensation of 
suboxone. , 
In practical effect, L.D. 1146 would do the following: 
1. Grant to health care professionals, who are licensed to prescribe controlled 
substances in the state of Maine, the authority to prescribe methadone toa 
person with substance use disorder, provided certain conditions are met. 
2. Require the prescriber to evaluate whether the person is sufficiently responsible 
in handling methadone for unsupervised use based on defined criteria, obsen/e 
statutorily defined timetables for unsupervised use, and certify that the person is 
participating in clinically appropriate counseling activities. 
3.‘ Establish the criteria prescribers must consider when making determinationsof 
responsibility, including regularity of counseling attendance, the absence of 
known recent criminal activity and observed behavioral problems, stability of the 
home environment, length of time in treatment, assurance of safe storage, and 
whether the potential benefit to the person of unsupervised uses outweighs the 
risk of diversion. 
4. Establish timetables for unsupervised use. In the first 45 days, the person would 
only receive one take-home dose a week. ln 45-day increments and without 
incident, this can gradually expand at the discretion of the physician. After six
months of continuous treatment, the person may only need to see their physician 
once every two weeks. After a year, they may only need to see them oncea 
month. 
Passing this policy would help destigmatize people in recovery and assist those who 
have demonstrated responsibility to reintegrate into society and resume normal life. 
Further, it would also free up resources at methadone clinics for those who most 
desperately need the structured environment of a clinical setting. 
I will close with a quote from U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), who introduced 
bipartisan federal legislation to this effect along with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky): 
“Opioid-related overdoses and deaths are the public health epidemic we 
aren’t talking about. lt’s never been more important to modernize and 
expand how patients receive opioid treatment. By decentralizing opioid 
treatment, making permanent expanded access to take home methadone, 
and allowing access to this life-saving treatment at pharmacies, we can 
expand access, create opportunity, and set more people on a pathway to 
recovery. This [policy] will help break down barriers to treatment, reduce 
interruption of patients ’ work and family lives, destigmatize opioid-use 
disorder, and save lives.” 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be happy to take questions to the 
best of my ability.

The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act 
Is a Good Step in the Right Direction, But It 
Should Go Further 
By Jeffrey A. Singer - ——- 
The government's approach toward treating people with substance use disorder is degrading and 
dehumanizing. It stigmatizes people who are suffering from a compulsive behavioral disorder. We don't 
treat people with other physical or mental health disorders this way. 
ln fact, roughly 3 million people in the U.S. suffer from opioid use disorder. More than 500,000 are 
dependent on heroin. Yet only 400,000 Americans are accessing methadone treatment. 
But with overdose deaths exceeding 100,000 per year and roughly 90 percent involving illicit fentanyl, 
some lawmakers in Congress are finally starting to think outside the box. Last year, Senators Edward D. 
Markey (D—MA) and Rand Paul (R-KY) and Representatives Donald Norcross (D-NJ) and Don Bacon 
(R—NE) introduced legislation that would have allowed some physicians to prescribe take-home 
methadone to patients with substance use disorder, as physicians have been doing for more than 
50 years in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. The bill failed to pass in the 117th Congress. 
On March 6, 2023, the same authors reintroduced the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act in 
the new Congress, which is essentially identical to last year's bill. 
While doctors can and do prescribe methadone for pain, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) impose stringent 
regulations on methadone treatment for addiction. Patients must travel daily—sometimes long 
distances —to Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), queue up outside the OTPs, and take the methadone 
in the presence of clinic staff. 
DEA's and SAMHSA's onerous regulations make it difficult for organizations to start and maintain OTPs. 
These organizations must also battle local NlMBYism, as people don't want centers that "attract drug 
addicts" in their communities. As a result, a quarter of the U.S. population lacks an OTP in their county. 
There are no OTPs at all in the state of Wyoming. 
During the COVID public health emergency, SAMHSA relaxed several regulations so people with 
substance use disorder could access these medications while minimizing the risk of contracting the

Health Services Administration seriously wants to destigmatize people with substance use 
disorder, it can start by destigmatizing how they receive treatment. 
The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act begins the de-stigmatization process by increasing 
access to methadone treatment for people with substance use disorder by allowing patients to receive 
treatment in doctors’ offices and clinics in the community. However, as Zoe Adams, MD et al. 
commented in Health Affairs when the legislation was introduced last year, the bill has shortcomings. 
A significant drawback is that the legislation only permits methadone prescriptions from "addiction 
medicine physicians or addiction psychiatrists who hold a subspecialty board certification in addiction 
medicine from the American Board of Preventive Medicine, a board certification in addiction medicine 
from the American Board of Addiction Medicine, a subspecialty board certification in addiction 
psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, or a subspecialty board certification 
in addiction medicine from the American Osteopathic Association." 
If lawmakers want to increase access to methadone treatment profoundly, they should allow primary 
care practitioners, including licensed Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs), to treat patients with 
methadone. Treating substance use disorder is complicated. lt requires practitioners to commit 
seriously to developing close relationships with their patients, taking the time for deep discussions, 
and monitoring them closely. Not every primary care practitioner will feel competent or interested in 
treating patients with substance use disorder. They will refer such patients to appropriate practitioners 
But allowing all interested primary care providers to engage in methadone-assisted treatment will 
significantly expand the options and access to patients needing care. 
Unfortunately, not nearly enough doctors in the US meet those requirements to increase access to the 
degree the bill's sponsors envision. The following table lists the number of physicians registered in 
each specialist category by state as of March 6, 2023.

Even if all the physicians can accept new patients, there are not enough of them to serve the millions 
of Americans with opioid use disorder who are not currently getting treated. Some states have very 
few qualifying physicians. For example, Wyoming has only five. 
Another drawback is that the bill limits the amount that doctors may prescribe to their patients to 
a supply of “not more than 30 days.” One would hope that after the fiasco of 38 states cementing in 
statute opioid prescribing guidelines based on the scientifically questionable and now—revised 2016 
opioid guidelines — which inflicted catastrophic harm on chronic pain patients — lawmakers would 
avoid legislating how doctors practice medicine. 
Lawmakers should not tie clinicians ’ hands. Doctors treating substance use disorder best know how, 
when, and how much to prescribe, especially to their long-term patients. As Adams and her colleagues 
stated, "Take—home methadone dosing should be decided by science, clinicians, and patients." 
Despite these shortcomings, Senators Markey and Paul, Representatives Norcross and Bacon, and 
their co—sponsors deserve praise for taking this important and worthy first step outside the box. 
Hopefully, it will be the first of many new measures in the right direction.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 
February 10, 2022 
Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343 
WASHENGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) introduced the 
Opioid Treatment Access Act to improve access to life-saving methadone treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD). The 
legislation would revise outdated regulations on methadone treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD) by reducing the 
time in treatment required for patients to receive take-home doses of medication and allowing pharmacies to dispense 
methadone for OUD treatment for the ﬁrst time. The blll also would codify a recent federal regulation allowing opioid 
treatment programs (OTPs) to add mobile treatment clinics and require the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) to study existing regulatory ﬂexibilities on accessing treatment for OUD. 
"As a physician, l know the vaiue of the doctor-patient relationship. This bipartisan legislation wili return treatment 
decisions to health care providers, who know their patients best. Doing so will be another important step toward 
combating the opioid epidemic that has caused so much harm in Kentucky and our nation," said Dr. Paul. 
“Opioid-related overdoses and deaths are the public health epidemic we aren't talking about. It's never been more 
important to modernize and expand how patients receive opioid treatment," said Senator Markey. "By decentralizing 
opioid treatment, making permanent expanded access to take home methadone, and allowing access to this life-saving 
treatment at pharmacies, we can expand access, create opportunity, and set more people on a pathway to recovery. This 
legislation will help break down barriers to treatment, reduce interruption of patients ’ work and family lives, destigmatize 
opioid-use disorder, and save lives." 
Representative Donald Norcross (NJ-01) introduced the Opioid Treatment Access Act in the House of Representatives in 
December 2021. 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal regulations required patients to make daily trips to opioid treatment clinics in 
order to receive doses of methadone. This process increased the stigma associated with methadone treatment and 
placed unnecessary burdens on patients. By expanding take-home doses and allowing pharmacy dispensing of 
methadone, the Opioid Treatment Access Act would make it easier for patients who work, have kids, or live far from 
opioid treatment programs to adhere to treatment regimens and stay in recovery. 
The bipartisan Opioid Treatment Access Act would modernize and improve the process of obtaining methadone for 
opioid-use disorder (OUD) treatment by: 
- Building on SAMHSA's COVID-19 exemptions that allow patients to receive longer take-home supplies of methadone; 
~ Allowing pharmacies to dispense methadone to OTP patients, rather than requiring patients to travel to clinics; 
~ Directing SAMHSA to conduct a full study on the impact of the COVID-19 methadone exemptions; and 
- Codifying regulations that allow OTPs to operate mobile medication components without separate DEA registrations. 
in March 2020, in response to the COVlD-19 pandemic, SAMHSA eased restrictions on opioid treatment programs to 
allow providers to prescribe longer supplies of take-home methadone to patients in treatment. According to preliminary 
studies. and feedback from patients and providers, this change increased patient engagement in treatment with minimal 
incidents of misuse or diversion of methadone.

DEA's and SAl\/lHSA's onerous regulations make it difficult for organizations to start and maintain OTPs. 
These organizations must also battle local NlMBYisrn, as people don't want centers that "attract drug 
addicts" in their communities. As a result, a quarter of the U.S. population lacks an OTP in their county. 
There are no OTPs at all in the state of Wyoming. 
During the COVID public health emergency, SAMHSA relaxed several regulations so people with 
substance use disorder could access these medications while minimizing the risk of contracting the
virus. For example, SAMHSA allowed OTPs to give a 28- day supply of take~home methadone to 
"stable" patients and a 14-day supply to "less stab|e” patients. 
Further, the agency permitted OTPs to operate vans that can go out to the patients where they live. To 
deal with pandemic- related OTP staffing problems, SAMHSA allowed people to receive "interim 
treatment" from OTPs (daily methadone but without the counseling and other services typically offered 
by OTPs) for up to 180 days. SAMHSA allowed certain OTP follow—up visits to use telemedicine. 
in July 2022, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry by researchers led by the National institute on 
Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 
that the emergency take- home methadone program “was not associated with harms” and ”add[ed] 
evidence to support take- home treatment for opioid use disorder." 
After numerous reports that the relaxed regulations did not result in misuse or diversion of methadone 
into the black market, SAMHSA decided to extend the relaxed rules until one year after the President 
officially declared the public health emergency over. 
On December 16, 2022, SAMHSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and solicited 
comments. The NPRM would make all the emergency measures permanent. 
l submitted my comment to the agency. ln it, I argued the relaxed rules were a step in the right 
direction, but that l and many others have long argued that health care practitioners-especially 
primary care providers interested in treating substance use disorder —should be allowed to prescribe 
take~home methadone to treat their patients with substance use disorder as they have been doing for 
decades in other countries. 
Furthermore, pilot programs in the U.S. have shown that this approach can be safe and effective in 
American communities. A 2018 article in the New England Journal of Medicine pointed to the success 
of this and other pilot programs. it called on Congress to pass legislation allowing health care 
practitioners to prescribe methadone as MAT to their patients with substance use disorder. In January 
2020, the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) made a similar plea. 
l have made this argument as well. in my comment to SAMHSA, I stated: 
The only way to completely destigmatize people with substance use disorder, and thus facilitate 
their access to care and improve the likelihood of recovery, is to remove the regulations and 
restrictions unique to opioid treatment programs. This includes rules affecting the use of 
telemedicine technology. Licensed health care practitioners should be able to prescribe opioid 
agonists such as methadone, as well as the partial agonist buprenorphine, to people with 
substance use disorder the same way the government allows them to specify beta blockers to 
treat hypertension and insulin to treat diabetes. ln short, if the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration seriously wants to destigmatize people with substance use 
disorder, it can start by destigmatizing how they receive treatment. 
The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act begins the de-stigmatization process by increasing 
access to methadone treatment for people with substance use disorder by allowing patients to receive 
treatment in doctors’ offices and clinics in the community. However, as Zoe Adams, MD et al. 
commented in Health Affairs when the legislation was introduced last year, the bill has shortcomings. 
A significant drawback is that the legislation only permits methadone prescriptions from "addiction 
medicine physicians or addiction psychiatrists who hold a subspecialty board certification in addiction 
medicine from the American Board of Preventive Medicine, a board certification in addiction medicine 
from the American Board of Addiction Medicine, a subspecialty board certification in addiction 
psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, or a subspecialty board certification 
in addiction medicine from the American Osteopathic Association. “ 
lf lawmakers want to increase access to methadone treatment profoundly, they should allow primary 
care practitioners, including licensed Family Nurse Practitioners (FNPs), to treat patients with 
methadone. Treating substance use disorder is complicated. lt requires practitioners to commit 
seriously to developing close relationships with their patients, taking the time for deep discussions, 
and monitoring them closely. Not every primary care practitioner will feel competent or interested in 
treating patients with substance use disorder. They will refer such patients to appropriate practitioners 
But allowing all interested primary care providers to engage in methadone-assisted treatment will 
significantly expand the options and access to patients needing care. 
Unfortunately, not nearly enough doctors in the US meet those requirements to increase access to the 
degree the bill's sponsors envision. The following table lists the number of physicians registered in 
each specialist category by state as of March 6, 2023.

Even if all the physicians can accept new patients, there are not enough of them to serve the millions 
of Americans with opioid use disorder who are not currently getting treated. Some states have very 
few qualifying physicians. For example, Wyoming has only five. 
Another drawback is that the bill limits the amount that doctors may prescribe to their patients to 
a supply of “not more than 30 days." One would hope that after the fiasco of 38 states cementing in 
statute opioid prescribing guidelines based on the scientifically questionable and now—revised 2016 
opioid guidelines — which inflicted catastrophic harm on chronic pain patients — lawmakers would 
avoid legislating how doctors practice medicine. 
Lawmakers should not tie clinicians ’ hands. Doctors treating substance use disorder best know how, 
when, and how much to prescribe, especially to their long-term patients. As Adams and her colleagues 
stated, "Take—home methadone dosing should be decided by science, clinicians, and patients." 
Despite these shortcomings, Senators Markey and Paul, Representatives Norcross and Bacon, and 
their co-sponsors deserve praise for taking this important and worthy first step outside the box. 
Hopefully, it will be the first of many new measures in the right direction.
