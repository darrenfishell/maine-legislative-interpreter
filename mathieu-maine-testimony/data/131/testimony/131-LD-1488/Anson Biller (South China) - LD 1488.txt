LD 1488
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human
Services Committee.
My name is Anson Biller, a strawberry farmer from South China, ME. I am writing in
support of LD 1488, which would help protect renters and home buyers from PFAS 
exposure by requiring disclosure of any known PFAS exposure at point of sale. 
As a relatively new farmer to Maine at eight years in the state, I can hardly imagine 
how devastating it would be for myself as both a business owner and a state resident 
if it turned out our water was contaminated with PFAS. The protections offered by 
LD1488 are an important step in protecting renters and homebuyers in Maine. I 
believe a future bill should go further even to require testing as part of the home sale 
process. I know individuals and families who are facing the devastation of PFAS 
contamination of their land and wells from previous and adjacent exposure. Not a 
single Mainer more should have to go through having that rug pulled up from beneath
them.
Please vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1488.
Thank you for your time,
Anson Biller
