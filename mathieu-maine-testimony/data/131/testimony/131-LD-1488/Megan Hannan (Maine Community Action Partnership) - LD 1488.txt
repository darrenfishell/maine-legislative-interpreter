207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1488 An Act 
Concerning Testing for and Disclosure of PFAS Contamination of 
Residential Drinking Water Wells 
April 28, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership, the membership organization 
of the ten Community Action Agencies in Maine, and we support LD 
1488 An Act Concerning Testing for and Disclosure of PFAS 
Contamination of Residential Drinking Water Wells. 
Our state's greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people’s possibilities. ln Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a family's capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the family’s well-being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success. 
As these families fulﬁll their promise, they can run into unintended 
consequences of policies enacted in good faith, before we learned more 
about what we were using to produce everyday products and to reuse 
products as a solution to another problem. This has happened many 
times in our recent history: widely used lead paint; carcinogens in 
gasoline, cigarettes and even some preserved foods; and per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sludge used to fertilize home 
gardens and farms. In each case, we did what we thought was best at 
the time. 
Times change, we know more about these chemicals and their harmful 
effects. While we still use gasoline every day, we are using less and 
less; we do not smoke tobacco in public places. In the case of PFAS, we 
cannot see it or smell it, but tested water shows it in over 380 residential 
drinking water wells in 22 Maine towns near known contamination sites; 
and 25 Maine schools, impacting up to 6,650 children, from unknown 
sites. That means on the order of nearly 10,000 people, that we know of, 
including many children, are being poisoned every time they have a drink 
of what should be life affirming water. 
LD 1488 simply adds PFAS testing to the already accepted list of 
common contaminants in well water that DHHS requires landlords must 
test and disclose before renting. In Maine, 27% of housing is rented; of 
that, nearly 1/3 use a well for water. The cost of testing and remediation 
is much less than the public health cost of PFAS, and the other harmful 
contaminants, resulting from human consumption. 
Thank you for your time and attention.
