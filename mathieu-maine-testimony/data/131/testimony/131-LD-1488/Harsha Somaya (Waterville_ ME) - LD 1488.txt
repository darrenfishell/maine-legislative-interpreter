Representative
Meyer ,
Senator
Claxton,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
My
name
is
Harsha
Somaya,
a
student
studying
in
Maine.
I
am
testifying
in
strong
support
of
LD1488.
I
begin
by
admitting
that
I
rarely
gave
thought
to
my
water .
I
assumed
it
was
clean.
In
reality ,
there
are
gaps
in
our
water
quality .
I
am
grateful
to
have
public
water
regulated
by
the
EP A
and
Maine
CDC,
but
worry
for
those
who
access
water
from
private
wells
that
are
outside
of
these
laws.
Are
they
aware
of
their
water
quality?
Do
they
use
water
filters?
Perhaps
they
do
not,
for
how
could
toxic
chemicals
find
themselves
deep
in
an
isolated
well?
Y et,
the
reality
is
our
people,
land,
and
water
are
contaminated
with
PF AS.
W e
never
consented
to
these
forever
substances;
they
proliferated
without
our
knowledge.
PF AS
are
linked
to
at
least
six
diseases,
including
high
cholesterol,
lung
cancer ,
and
thyroid
disease.
I
suspect
their
ef fects
range
beyond
these
six.
Farms
have
shut
down
due
to
PF AS-contaminated
sludge
infecting
their
soil,
livestock,
aquifers
and
wells.
The
EP A ’ s
proposal
to
limit
PFOA
and
PFOS
stringently
at
4
parts
per
trillion
in
drinking
water
indicates
that
exposure
should
be
very
limited.
At
the
very
least,
we
should
know
if
our
water
is
contaminated.
Other
states
have
acted
–
for
example,
V ermont
passed
Act
21,
which
requires
approximately
650
public
community
and
nontransient
noncommunity
water
systems
to
test
for
PF AS.
If
testing
is
required
and
residents
are
informed
by
landlords,
they
can
use
this
awareness
to
take
appropriate
action.
Either
way ,
requiring
testing
reveals
knowledge
about
an
essential
component
of
our
health:
drinking
water .
This
testing
should
not
be
limited
to
only
those
with
public
water ,
for
we
all
need
clean
water
and
are
all
af fected
by
PF AS.
Hence,
I
strongly
encourage
the
passing
of
LD1488
for
the
health
of
everyone.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Harsha
Somaya
