  
Testimony of Adele Weaver - North Yarmouth, ME 
In SUPPORT of LD 1488, ‘An Act to Expand Testing for Perfluoroalkyl & Polyfluoroalkyl 
Substances to Private Drinking Water Wells’ 
Before the Health and Human Services Committee 
April 28th, 2023 
  
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee.  My name is Adele Weaver.  I am graduating from Greely High School this year and 
heading to college in Maine in the fall.   Please accept this testimony in support of LD 1214, which 
would help protect renters and home buyers from PFAS exposure. 
This year, I was part of the Greely Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition team where 
we were State Champions, working to address the nationwide PFAS crisis. We have worked with 
PFAS researchers at the University of Maine, Orono (Dr. Apul and Dr. Chardhoury), who are 
experts in this field and provided us with crucial information which led to a deeper 
understanding of the issue. We also met with ECT2, a company at the forefront of remediating 
PFAS contamination around the country and world.  
 
 LD1488 would require landlords to test their water for PFAS and provide the renter with 
the results of that testing. Currently, landlords can and have refrained from communicating the 
results to the renter which is a risk to the renter’s health. In order to guarantee the safety and 
security of renters in Maine, it is imperative that the water has been tested and the results are 
communicated.  
 
I hope you consider the impacts of this bill on future generations and do what is right for 
the citizens of Maine.   I urge you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1488. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Adele Weaver 
North Yarmouth, ME
