Testimony in favor of LD 1488 - requiring notification of renters of PFAS in water

Sen. Baldacci, Rep. Meyer, and members of the HHS committee
I am writing as a representative of the Maine Chapter of the American Academy
of Pediatrics, an organization of over 300 health care practitioners distr.ibuted
throughout the state who focus on the care of infants, children, teens and young
adults. We are concerned about the theoretical link btetween intrauterine and
early life exposure to PFAS compounds and increased disease risk for
developmental delays in childhood. ln addition, their physiologic effects are
associated with later-onset hormone imbalance, chronic kidney disease, obesity,
and some cancers. (Toxicoloqv. 2020 Oct: ,143: 152565 ). Adding to our concern is the
fact that, by weight, bottle fed infants using PFAS-contaminated water have the
h ighest exposu res levels.
High occupational exposures were noted by DuPont many decades ago to have
likely caused birth defects in the offspring of workers. These concerns led to
further research that promoted a switch away from PFOS and PFOA to shorter
chain and more complex replacemeqts, though safety data was limited. (sciAm
May 2020). The thought at the time was that these compounds would have
shorter half lives in humans and have less potential for harm, but unfortunately
they and their metabolites can become incorporated into organs and persist.
Dr. Grandjean from Harvard was contracted by the EU to investigate PFAS
effects on children in the Faroe lsles decades ago. He was surprised to find that
the kids' responses to vaccines were dampened. Other European studies
demonstrated an increased risk of miscarriage, along with adverse effects on
pubertal development and on thyroid functions. (Grandjean letterto Michigan legislators,
2018)
It is unfortunate that these very useful compounds have had unintended
consequences due to their chemical properties. While we search for alternatives
and discontinue their non-essential use, it seem prudent to minimize the
exposure of Maine citizents. Public water supplies are monitored. New renters,
especially those in the reproductive years, should have the same protections
from potential harm, either by renting elsewhere or using an alternative water
source.
