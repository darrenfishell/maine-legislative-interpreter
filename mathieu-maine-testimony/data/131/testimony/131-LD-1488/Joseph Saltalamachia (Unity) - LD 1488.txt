My name is Joseph Saltalamachia. I'm a licensed, Maine Realtor, living in Unity 
Maine. I assist sellers and buyers in the sale of residential properties and of raw land. 
It's my opinion, that providing a space for known PFAS information on a property 
disclosure, is a good idea. A person buying a piece of land in order to farm it, should 
be notified if there's known PFAS in the soil or the water of that land. The same holds
true if a residential property knows there is PFAS in the well water. Any potential 
buyer should be alerted. MAR already has spots on a property disclosure to report 
water testing or to report storage tanks on a property. PFAS should be no different. A 
buyer deserves to know if a property has PFAS contamination of any level, if it's 
known to a seller. 
I am not in favor of forcing a property owner to pay for this testing. If testing is to be 
mandatory in the sale of a property, the state should pay for the PFAS testing.
