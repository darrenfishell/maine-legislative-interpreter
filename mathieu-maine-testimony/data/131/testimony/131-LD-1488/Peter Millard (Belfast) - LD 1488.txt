Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances to Private Drinking Water Wells 
 
Esteemed members of the Committee on Health and Human Services. I am a family physician 
and epidemiologist. I live in Belfast and have practiced medicine in Maine for the past 30 years. 
I am testifying on behalf of Maine Physicians for Social Responsibility.  
 
The Maine chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) supports LD1488, a bill that 
would require landlords to test for PFAS and disclose the results to tenants. 
 
Maine PSR is an organization of health professionals who advocate for policies and practices 
that eliminate pervasive threats to the safety, security, health and well-being of the people of 
Maine and the world. 
 
PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer 
products worldwide since the 1950s. They have been linked to various health problems such as 
cancer, thyroid disease, and immune system dysfunction. 
 
Currently, tenants cannot secure PFAS water testing without the permission of their landlord, 
which may leave them vulnerable to continued exposure. 
 
All Mainers should have access to safe drinking water.   
 
LD1488 is common-sense legislation which will require landlords to conduct PFAS testing and to 
disclose the results to tenants. Maine PSR supports this legislation.
