Testimony of Matthew Marks in Opposition  to LD  1171 
“An Act to Raise Funding to Support Waste Reduction, Reuse, Recycling and Composting in Maine ” 
Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources  
April 5 , 2023 
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich , and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Environment and Natural Resources  my name  is Matthew  Marks,  I am a Principal at Cornerstone  
Government  Affairs,  and here  today  to speak  on behalf  of my client  The Assoc iated  General  Contractors  
of Maine.  AGC  Maine  is a statewide  commercial construction  trade  association  and a Chapter  of AGC  
America  which  was founded  in 1918  with  27,000 contractors,  suppliers,  and service  providers.   
 
In the 130th Legislature  Representative  McDon ald presented  LD 259,  “An Act to Improve  Solid  Waste  
Management”  which  included  an increase  in the construction  debris  from  $2/ton to $7/ton. As I recall,  
House  Chair  Representative Tucker  cited  the testimony  of AGC  Maine  and the Homebuilders  and 
Remodelers  as part of his decision  to amend  the bill to strike  the increase.   
 
Both  associations  communicated  our concerns  that increasing  costs  for construction  debris  will 
contribute  to our ongoi ng issue  with  material prices  and resulting  home -building costs.  Maine  has an 
estimated  19,000 units1 required  to meet  the demand  of low-income  residents.  Home  prices2 in Maine  
were  up 9.9%  year- over -year  in February.  At the same  time,  the number  of homes  sold fell 20.0%  and 
the number  of homes  for sale fell 12.6%.  The median  home  price  has risen  to $335,000 , while  in 
February  2020 , the price  was $220,400.   
 
One of the primary  contributors  is the cost of raw materials  to build.  The Producer Price Index (PPI) 
declined at the beginning of the pandemic but began climbing on a year -over -year basis in August 2020. 
As prices rose at unprec edented rates for a wide range of construction inputs, the index accelerated 
steeply, rising at a record -high annual rate of 24% in June 2021. Year- over -year increases remained at or 
above 20% from May 2021 through April 2022.  
 
Subcontractors’ prices refle ct their own materials costs, labor costs, and the degree of tightness in the 
market for their services. Notably, the PPI for all four types of subcontractors rose far more than the 7.7% increase in the CPI from October 2021 to October 2022: 21.5% for roof ing contractors, 18.8% for 
electrical contractors, 15.7% for plumbing contractors, and 10.9% for concrete contractors.  
 
As everyone has been impacted by rising fuel costs, the PPI for diesel increase 65.5% from October 
2021. Labor costs for residential construction increased 7.1% since February of 2020. Additionally, 
material shortages, delays, and create workarounds have added costs due to the time and resulting changes to designs. For example, contractors expressed growing c oncerns about the availability of

contractors are working with utilities to plan and secure supplies to meet the growing demand and address supply chain c hallenges. Any additional cost is problematic for the housing industry.  
 
This bill will add to the strained marketplace and have a direct impact on costs, it simply isn’t the right 
time  to introduce a tax increase  on this waste stream . We encourage the Committee to reject the fee 
increase and vote Ought Not to Pass . I am happy to answer any questions.
