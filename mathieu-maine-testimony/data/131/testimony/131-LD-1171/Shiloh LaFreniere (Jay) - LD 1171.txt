Written Testimony of the Town of Jay In Opposition to LD 1171  - An Act To Raise Fu nding to 
Support Was te Reduc tion, Reuse, Recycling and Composting in Maine  
 
April 5, 2023  
 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich  and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, my name is Shiloh LaFreniere and I am the Town Manager for the Town 
of Jay.  I am providing written testimony in opposition to LD 1171 . 
 
The Town of Jay asks that you o ppose  any further charges being applied to our cost of disposing 
of munic ipal solid waste  (MSW). Our tip fees are already slated to rise in fiscal year 2023 -24 from 
our current level of $65.94 /ton + the $2 assessment to $74.50 plus the $2 assessment for MSW and 
from our current level of $65.94 + the $5 asse ssment for demo. These increases  have already added 
nearly $19,000 to our budget for the coming year. The additional increases proposed in LD 1171 
would add another $10,000 plus. The former increase was known when we prepared our budg ets 
and has been accounted for. The additional amount  in LD 1171 was not. A bsentee v oting has 
already b egun for our municipal  budget and there is no way to amend it to include the se additional 
fees short o f a special town meeting that would cost our residents even more.  
 
We, like nearly everyone  else, are experiencing high labor cost (and still struggl ing to fill some 
positions)  along with high costs for gas, d iesel, parts, insurance, steel, etc.  Also our cost to recycle  
E-waste, tires, HHW and shingles has risen sharply in the past year with no end in sight. In Jay we 
are also faced with the challenge of the paper mill closing in March.  
 
Now is not the time to add more fees to our already stretched budgets. The addition of the  proposed 
fees on our municipality  has a direct effect on our resident’s  property taxes  at a time when they 
are already facin g a significant increase.  
  
We respectively ask that you vote “Ought not to pass” on LD 1171 to prevent the impact of 
additional fees on our residents.
