Rick Erb
Town of St. George
LD 1171
Members of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources:
My name is Rick Erb and I am the Town Manager of St. George, Maine.  We are 
located in Knox County and have a population of approximately 2,600.
I am contacting you to convey my opposition to LD 1171, which I understand would 
increase the per ton fee on municipal solid waste (MSW) from $2 per ton to $7 per 
ton.  Although I appreciate the sentiment of providing funds for municipal recycling, I
believe that this measure would create a burden on municipal taxpayers and be an 
inefficient way to support recycling.
St. George is facing a property tax increase of 15% this year, largely because of 
increased emergency medical services costs and a shift in school funding.  Any 
additional burden created  by a jump in the tax on MSW would make a bad situation 
worse.  Our town operates a successful recycling program and we are very proud of it.
An infusion of state funds for recycling, while laudable in concept, would do little to 
improve what we are already doing.  The idea of taxing municipalities so that funds 
can then be returned to them makes little sense to me.  I'm certain that the taxpayers 
of our town would say the same thing.  
Please help us hold the line on future property tax rate increases by voting "Ought Not
to Pass" on LD 1171.  Thank you.
