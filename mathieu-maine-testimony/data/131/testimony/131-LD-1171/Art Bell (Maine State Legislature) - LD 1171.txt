Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and distinguished members of the Joint Committee 
on the Environment and Natural Resources, thank you for the opportunity to introduce this 
legislation. My name is Representative Art Bell and l have the privilege of sen/ing the Town of 
Yarmouth. 
l am pleased to introduce LD 1171, An Act to Raise Funding to Support Waste Reduction, 
Reuse, Recycling and Composting in Maine, as a way to best utilize the state's solid waste 
hierarchy in practice and not just in theory. This bill will discourage Iandﬁlling and put much- 
needed revenue toward the highest rungs of the hierarchy - something that our predecessors in 
this body enshrined in statute many years ago. 
The funds raised from landfilling will be shared by all of us — municipalities and residents in 
Maine. One of the notable benefits of this proposal that l would like to emphasize is that it will it 
help us address the issue of out of state waste. Out of state waste will have to pay the fee into 
the fund but will not be eligible to receive any funding from the program that the fee will fund. 
Only Maine interests will be eligible. This will not only add to the revenues that the State 
collects, but it will also help us decrease the amount of waste coming into Maine from sources 
outside the state. 
What will these funds be used for? Here are some examples from last year (2022): 
v $25,000 went to Northern Aroostook Solid Waste for recycling 
o $30,000 went to Montville for recycling 
0 $13,000 went to Rockland for composting 
0 $7,000 went to Ogunquit for food waste recovery 
- $40,000 went to Auburn for reuse and repurposing 
$27,000 went to S. Portland for reuse and reduction 
$29,000 went to Sanford for food waste recovery 
$9,000went to Portland for education and outreach 
$40,000 went to Sargentville for food waste recovery 
Others can speak better to the issues we have in front of us, in terms of the challenges of 
Iandﬁlling, recycling, and waste management. But l am very proud to present this bill as a way 
to put our money where our mouth is — to provide funding to Maine’s communities for strategies 
that will put Iandﬁlling as the last rung of the hierarchy, where it was designed to be, and not the 
cheapest, easiest alternative. 
Thank you for your consideration, and l’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have.
