To: Whom it may Concern 
Good Afternoon Senators and Representatives. Today I learned of a bill, LD 1171, that 
was having a public hearing tomorrow. Unfortunately I was not able to attend but wanted 
to provide input to this very important bill. 
LD 1171 increases the fee to municipalities by $5.00 per ton for municipal solid waste 
and construction debris. This comes after the exemption was removed previously and 
Towns and Cities were required to pay the $2.00 per ton. These increases have a huge 
ﬁscal impact to citizens as municipal budgets rise to account for the changes. 
Citizens have already seen sharp increases in their sewer bills because of the requirement 
now to ship wastewater facility sludge. There is already concern that the State isn’t 
getting enough construction debris to handle the wastewater facility sludge. The cost 
increases to solid waste disposal has signiﬁcantly risen due to fees the State is imposing, 
rising costs ﬁ'om facilities that accept solid waste and the ﬂuctuating amounts that our 
solid waste facilities are receiving as revenue for recycle material. 
I hear everyday ﬁ-om my residents that they can not afford the rising Sewer bills, tax bills 
and other bills they need to pay. 
I strongly urge the committee to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1171. 
Sincerely, 
J5/7 aha Stacy L. Carter, Town Manager & Administrator
