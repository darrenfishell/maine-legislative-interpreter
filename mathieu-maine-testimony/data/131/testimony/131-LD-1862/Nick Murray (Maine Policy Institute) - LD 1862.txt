Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LDs
1862,
1872,
and
1876.
We
are
pleased
to
see
bipartisan
interest
in
outlining
proper
balance
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
in
times
of
extended
emergency.
While
we
would
prefer
this
committee
to
advance
bill
language
closest
to
that
of
LDs
1862
and
1872,
we
believe
that
LD
1876
offers
a
proper
compromise
to
address
the
concerning
possibility
of
an
open-ended
state
of
emergency,
which
is
allowed
under
current
law.
Since
2020,
13
states
have
amended
their
emergency
powers
laws
to
provide
better
balance
to
executive
power
through
requiring
legislative
input
and
consent.
These
changes
have
been
tracked
in
Maine
Policy
Institute’s
first-in-the-nation
scorecard
of
legislative
oversight
over
emergency
executive
power
in
all
50
states
over
the
last
three
years.

The
bills
in
front
of
you
today
mirror
many
of
the
reforms
seen
around
the
country.
These
include
prescribing
a
standard
length
of
time
for
a
state
of
emergency
declaration
and
requiring
legislative
approval
in
order
to
extend
an
emergency
beyond
the
initial
declaration.
Above
all,
this
aspect
of
reform
is
the
most
important.
No
one
disputes
that
a
governor
should
have
latitude
during
an
emergency
to
respond
quickly
to
an
evolving
threat
to
the
citizens
of
that
state,
however,
it
may
be
unwise
to
grant
such
absolute
power
for
an
extended
period
of
time.
After
a
reasonable
amount
of
time—from
two
weeks
to
a
month—the
people’s
branch
should
be
back
in
control.
Unfortunately,
Maine
law
today
only
allows
for
the
Legislature
to
opt-out
of
a
state
of
emergency.
Instead,
a
standard
process
should
be
in
place
for
future
emergency

declarations,
which
simply
require
the
governor
to
earn
an
affirmative
vote
of
legislators
in
order
to
renew
a
state
of
emergency,
beyond
the
first
30
days.
The
emergency
declaration,
extension,
and
termination
process
should
be
clear
and
consistent,
no
matter
the
current
political
makeup
of
the
legislature
and
executive
branch.
By
requiring
periodic
legislative
approval,
as
many
of
these
bills
propose,
the
law
would
require
legislators
and
the
governor
to
convene
in
public,
lay
out
the
facts,
and
develop
a
consensus
for
governing
in
an
extended
emergency
situation.
Legislators
should
also
be
able
to
amend
or
rescind
specific
emergency
orders
by
joint
resolution,
and
Mainers
should
be
able
to
challenge
emergency
orders
under
the
“strict
scrutiny”
standard,
whereby
the
state
must
prove
that
it
is
fulfilling
a
compelling
interest
with
the
least
restrictive
means
possible.
It
is
crucial
that
governing
authority
be
vested
primarily
in
the
people’s
body;
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers
must
not
be
forgotten,
even
during
an
emergency.
Please
deem
LDs
1862,
1872,
and
1876
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
instill
a
more
adequate
balance
in
how
emergency
powers
are
wielded
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
