Testimony of Anya Trundy , Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations  
Department of Administrative and Financial Services  
testifying in Opposition  
 
LD 1889, An Act to Provide Authorization to Aroostook County to Use the Statewide Radio 
Network System  
 
Present ed by Senate President Jackson  
To the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology  
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler , and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Energy, Utilities, and Technology , I am Anya Trundy , Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services . I am providing testimony Against LD 
1889, but also to inform the Committee, Aroostook County and other interested counties  of the 
forthcoming process by which they  may be able to co-locate their radio equipment on Maine State 
Communication Network (MSCommNet) radio frequency  (RF) towers —provided that  doing so would 
not create harmful interference and where there is additional tower load  capacit y. 
 
As written, this bill would give Aroostook County unique access to MSCommNet ’s radio frequency 
towers  that is not being extended to other counties. Make no mistake, w e are not suggesting that 
the bill be broadened to inc orporate the other 15 counties—the system does not have available 
bandwidth and tower load capacity  to match the interest anticipated across all counties.  
 When MSCommNet  was accepted in 2014,  a moratorium on co-location was established. This was 
done to allow the State to focus on  stabilizing the system. In response to more recent co -locating 
interest , the Office of Information Technology Radio Operations group has developed a draft process 
to enable government organizations  to request access to radio frequency sites , pending review , 
engineering analysis , and approval.  
 
MSCommNet  consists of 40 radio frequency sites ; 33 of these sites have a hard-wired  shore power 
sourc e and seven are solar powered. Of the 33  hard-wired , the State has jurisdiction over 23, while 
the other 10 belong to the federal Department of Homeland Securit y, Customs and Border 
Protection.  Of the seven solar powered, three are under the State,  while the other four are 
DHS/CBP’s.  The State does not have the authority to authorize co-location on the federal towers  
and the solar powered sites were not designed with surplus capacity. There are nine state owned  
towers located in Aroostook County , 5 that may have the potential for co-locations of the County’s  
equipment .  
 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I am happy to answer any questions.
