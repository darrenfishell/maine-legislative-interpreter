May 16, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Lawrence, RepresentatIve ZeIgler, and honorable members of the 
JoInt StandIng Comm|ttee on Energy, UtIlItIes, and Technology My name IS Troy Jackson andI 
have the honor of servmg as Senate PresIdent representIng the good people of Aroostook 
County In the MaIne LegIslature I apologIze for not beIng there In person, but I am pleased to 
testIfy In support of LD 1889 ”An Act to Provlde AuthorIzatIon to Aroostook County to Use the 
Statew|de Rad|o and Network System" 
ThIs bIll reflects a need amongst rural law enforcement and ﬁrst responders for relIable access 
to radIo servIce — somethIng that IS not guaranteed In much of Aroostook County To me, It's 
only rIght that we ensure County and local patrols have access to the communIcatIons system 
we already have In place In our state so that they can do theIr crItIca| work 
GrantIng Aroostook County access to the towers on the State's RadIo Network only makes for 
greater safety of our communItIes As patrols prevIously conducted by state troopers 
Increasmgly become the responsIbIIIty of County law enforcement offIcers, we need to ensure 
that these offlcers can communIcate effIcIently and effectIvely, especIally In emergency 
sItuatIons Unfortunately, County law enforcement does not have access to thIs vItal 
communIcatIon network 
After fIlIng thIs bIll, I've heard from folks In other rural areas of the state who also struggle wIth 
lack of radIo servIce for ﬁrst responders on the county level I know that the need for access to 
radIo Is not lImIted to Aroostook County, and I hope you'll conslder theIr comments as well as 
the bIll moves forward 
In the end, the current State Rad|o and Network System Is paId for by taxpayers, and Is 
Intended to serve the pubIIc Interest It can more fully meet the needs of both taxpayers and of
