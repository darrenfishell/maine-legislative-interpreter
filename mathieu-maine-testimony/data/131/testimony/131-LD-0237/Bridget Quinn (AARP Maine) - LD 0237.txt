Testimony Opposed to LD 237: An Act to Require a Registered Voter to 
Update the Registration
Greetings Senator Hickman and Representative Supica and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs.
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older to choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 200,000 
members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony.  Today AARP Maine submits 
this written testimony in opposition to LD 237. 
AARP has been fighting to protect the rights of all Americans 50+ to vote freely, easily and safely for 
more than 35 years. We have a long history of non-partisan voter education and engagement, in 
addition to fair and straightforward election procedures that help increase the participation of 
voters aged 50 and older. LD237 concerns us because requiring Maine voters to renew their voter 
registration every four years will likely discourage voting by unnecessarily complicating the voting 
process.  
AARP opposes voter renewal requirements because these laws threaten to reduce legitimate citizen 
participation – particularly by older voters – in the electoral process. LD 237’s voter registration 
renewal requirements also risk an adverse impact to voters living in nursing homes, assisted living 
facilities, or congregate settings. Many of these voters live with limited incomes, limited 
transportation and/or disabilities, and they may find it difficult to acquire the necessary means to 
renew their voter registration. Additionally, there are no provisions in LD 237 to educate voters on 
these changes, which could catch many off-guard, leaving them unable to exercise their 
constitutional right.  
AARP supports goals of secure elections, but changes to the voting process should ensure increased 
access, fairness, and simplicity; not added barriers and complexity. 
Thank you for your time, and we urge the members of this committee to oppose LD 237. If you have 
questions for AARP Maine, please contact AARP Maine Advocacy and Outreach Director at 
bquinn@aarp.org or 207-272-8563. 
Thank you.
