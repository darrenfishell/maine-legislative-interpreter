Testimony of Senator Mike Tipping introducing 
LD 1278, An Act to Require Timely Payment for Salaried Employees 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
April 4, 2023 
Rep. Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and Housing Committee, lam Mike Tipping, 
representing Senate District 8, part of Penobscot County. I am grateful to be with you today to introduce 
LD 1278, ”An Act to Require Timely Payment for Salaried Employees." 
LD 1278 seeks to clarify statute that has created confusion regarding the payment of wages to certain 
salaried employees. In my initial conversations with Maine Department of Labor, I discovered that the 
Department has received 50 plus calls and emails concerning the timely and full payment of wages for 
salaried employees, since 2019. Currently, lvlaine statutes include no provision effectively requiring that 
salaried employees be paid according to a defined predetermined pay period, as is required for hourly 
employees, making it impossible in some cases to enforce the timely payment of salaries to those 
employees. These workers deserve to know when they can expect full payment of wages. 
The bill amends language as necessary to correct the exclusion of salaried employees from the timely 
and full payment requirement. It also clarifies employer's responsibility to maintain accurate regards 
regarding payment to salaried employees. In effect, as written, LD 1278 requires an employer to 
establish a pay period for salaried employees, unless those employees are family members or 
employees who are also stockholders of a limited liability partnership or an S corporation. These 
amendments provide needed clarity for workers, who are counting on receiving wages earned at regular 
intervals. it should also be noted that the bill does not mandate onto employers any payment schedule, 
only clarifies the need to pay employees at regular intervals. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have at this 
time or at a future work session.
