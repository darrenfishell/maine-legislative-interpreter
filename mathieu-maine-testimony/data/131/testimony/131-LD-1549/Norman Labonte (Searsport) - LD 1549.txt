LD 1549
I support LD1549, the act to "Seek Informational Bids Regarding Small Modular 
Nuclear Reactors". There should be no resistance to viable alternatives for clean 
energy that can favorably compare to other sources presently available. This initial 
phase of encouraging prospective investment in this very efficient clean energy 
system is a definite move in the right direction for the state of Maine. Energy costs 
will continue to increase rapidly and the best way to minimize costs is to allow proven
technologies to be supported and encouraged. This bill should be unanimously passed.
