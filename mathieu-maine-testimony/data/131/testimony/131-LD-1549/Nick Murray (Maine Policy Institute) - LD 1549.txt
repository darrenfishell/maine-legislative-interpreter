Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1549:
“An
Act
to
Direct
the
Public
Utilities
Commission
to
Seek
Informational
Bids
Regarding
Small
Modular
Nuclear
Reactors
in
the
State”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1549.
Maine
lawmakers
have
identified
climate
change
as
a
necessary
problem
to
tackle,
and
in
response
have
sought
to
shift
the
state’s
energy
portfolio
to
include
more
“clean”
sources
of
energy
such
as
wind
and
solar.
However,
the
state’s
energy
production
has
grown
ever
more
expensive
over
the
last
two
decades,
leaving
consumers
and
businesses
desperate
for
relief.
In
2023
alone,
costs
to
CMP
residential
customers
are
expected
to
rise
by
roughly
26
percent.
1
While
there
is
some
acknowledgment
in
Augusta
of
growing
energy
expenses,
the
governor
and
lawmakers
have
done
very
little
beyond
attempting
to
alleviate
short-term
financial
stress
by
providing
temporary
relief
in
the
way
of
rebate
checks
to
Maine
residents.
2
The
reason
Maine
has
such
high
energy
costs
is
primarily
a
supply
issue.
Maine
currently
generates
less
electricity
than
all
but
five
other
states,
increasing
pressure
on
prices.
3
Making
matters
worse,
the
energy
we
do
produce
is
of
a
particularly
expensive
and
volatile
type
due
to
the
deliberate
choices
Maine
has
made
to
emphasize
expensive
and
unreliable
renewable
energy
sources.
If
Maine
is
going
to
pursue
clean—and
reliable—energy
alternatives
to
fossil
fuels,
it
needs
to
consider
trying
to
cultivate
nuclear
power
in
Maine
once
more.
Decommissioning
nuclear
power
plants
has
not
aided
New
England
state
governments
in
their
oft-publicized
searches
for
cleaner
energy
sources.

carbon

actually
rose,
during
a
time
when
overall
emissions
had
been
falling.

Small
Modular
Reactor
(SMR)
techonology
is
an
exciting
new
development
in
this
space,
classified
as
having
capacity
between
50
MW
and
300
MW,
about
one-third
that
of
traditional
reactors.
Given
that
Maine
uses
about
970,000
megawatt-hours
(MWh)
of
electricity
in
a
typical
month,5
between
five
and
20
SMRs
could
power
the
whole
state,
reliably
producing
baseload
power,
with
zero
carbon
emissions.
We
commend
the
sponsors
for
bringing
this
forward-thinking
piece
of
legislation
to
require
annual
reports
from
the
PUC
on
the
feasibility
of
establishing
SMR
nuclear
power
generation
in
Maine.
Frankly,
the
Maine
Public
Utilities
Commission
(PUC)
should
already
be
investigating
SMRs.
Modern
nuclear
technology
is
considerably
safer
and
more
efficient
than
the
nuclear
technology
of
the
past.
SMR
technology
offers
the
potential
of
quicker
construction,
lower
costs,
and
improved
safety
over
traditional
nuclear
reactors.
This
bill
is
common
sense,
truth
be
told,
the
PUC
should
already
be
looking
into
SMRs,
since
the
first
one
was
approved
by
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
(NRC)
last
year.
6
Doing
so
could
catapult
Maine
to
become
a
leader
in
emission-free
energy
production,
increasing
supply
and
supporting
lower
prices
for
not
only
the
state
and
New
England,
but
as
an
example
to
the
nation
and
the
world.
Please
deem
LD
1549
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
begin
to
explore
how
this
exciting
new
technology
can
positively
impact
Mainers’
standard
of
living.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
