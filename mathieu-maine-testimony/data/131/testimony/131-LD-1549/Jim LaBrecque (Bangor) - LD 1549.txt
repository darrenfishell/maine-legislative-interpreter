L.D. 1549: An Act to Direct the Public Utilities Commission to Seek 
Informational Bids Regarding Small Modular Nuclear Reactors in the State 
Dear Chairs and members of the Committee, 
My name is Jim LaBrecque, I am from Bangor I\/laine and here to testify in Favor of 
L.D. 1549. 
1)

5) About 345,000 homes heat with oil. At 80% efficiency 1 gal. of #2 oil 
equals 110,80OBtu 
If the average Maine home only used a half gallon/hour oil nozzle ona 
design winter night, those homes would require 19 billion Btuh 
1 Watt equals 3.41214163Btu/hr. 
To heat only those homes on a design winter night, it would take 5.6 
one thousand-megawatt nuclear power plants or 730 Farmington Maine 
500-acre 76.5 MW size solar farms (plus batteries) or 16 times the 
capacity of the proposed Aroostook County power project. 
When considering the total BTU demand for all electric heat on a design 
winter night for all Maine homes, commercial business, industry, 
institutions, you can multiply the demand for heat for those 345,000 
homes by approximately seven.
6) Seven times 730 Farmington solar farms is 5,110, this would require 319 
of the 500-acre solar farms/county or 112 Aroostook County proposed 
power projects. 
7) Energy density of a 275-gallon oil tank is equal to 1,269 Leaf automobile 
battery packs at a total weight of 850,620 pounds. (Note: This is based on the 
older Leaf auto battery pacts, new battery improvements will weigh less but this is an issue 
of magnitude.) 
8) Maine is the most heavily oil dependent state per capita in the nation 
and is in the top 4 states for cleanest electricity. Our CO2 problem is oil 
not electricity, our solution is not to overly subsidize solar projects, but 
to look for systems with greater energy densities than oil, l know of no 
alternative better than nuclear. 
9) Note: These numbers are based on winter design loads using all 
resistant electric heat 
10) Conclusion: Wind and solar panels are not going to get Maine off oil!
