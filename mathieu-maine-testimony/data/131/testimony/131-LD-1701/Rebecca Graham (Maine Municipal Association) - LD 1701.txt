 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association 
In Support For 
LD 1701 - Resolve, to Reestablish and Continue the Work of the Blue Ribbon Commission to Study 
Emergency Medical Services in the State 
May 4, 2023 
Sen. Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury and distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I providing testimony, in support of LD 1701, 
Resolve, to Reestablish and Continue the Work of the Blue Ribbon Commission to Study Emergency 
Medical Services in the State, on behalf of the Maine Municipal Association, which represents the 
interests of municipal government before the Legislature. The positions of the Association are established 
by our 70-member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC), who are elected by the councils and selectboards 
of municipalities in each of Maine’s 35 Senate districts. 
Last year, MMA’s representation on the Blue Ribbon Commission to Study Emergency Medical 
Services expressed a need to dive deeper into the complex issues around adequate EMS provision across 
the state and particularly in rural areas. Our officials and our representative feel like there is a great deal 
more to accomplish and review to properly make a comprehensive set of recommendations with the 
possibility of presenting actionable reforms and support to improve the system, not just the somewhat 
temporary fixes introduced this session. A review of training costs, impacts and equitable access and true 
sustainable service provision are key among these areas of need requiring a deeper dive and future 
legislative support.  
For these reasons, municipal officials support the reconstitution of the Blue Ribbon Commission 
to Study Emergency Medical Services and ask that the committee vote ought to pass on LD 1701.
