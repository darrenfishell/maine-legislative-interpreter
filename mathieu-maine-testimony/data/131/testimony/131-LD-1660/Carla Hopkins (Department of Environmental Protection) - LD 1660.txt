L.D. 1660 — An Act to Provide That Advanced Recycling Facilities Are Subject to Solid Waste Regulation 
and That Advanced Recycling Does Not Constitute Recycling 
Testimony of: Carla Hopkins/DEP 
Public Hearing: May 8, 2023 
Page 2 of3 
Currently, definitions of recycling in Maine do not include the production of any type of 
fuel, or the generation of heat, steam, energy, or electricity as “recycling. ” 
For example, statutes 38 M.R.S. § 1771(7), 38 M.R.S. § 1303-C(22), and the 
Department rule, O6-096 CMR Chapter 400 § 1 (Qq) all specifically exclude any type of 
incineration, combustion, or use as a fuel, including: “energy recovery or energy 
generation by means of combusting unwanted products, components and by-products 
with or without other waste,” and “as a fuel for the generation of electricity. ” 
This bill aligns with the existing precedent of excluding the use of materials as a fuel or 
for the generation of energy from the definition of “recycling. ” However, the 
Department is concerned that the broad language contained in the definition of 
“advanced recycling" in Section 1 of the proposed bill, could have the unintended 
consequence of encompassing all recycling activities, including existing mechanical 
recycling technologies. 
Currently, most plastics-to-plastics recycling happens through mechanical recycling 
processes. While non-mechanical recycling processes for plastics vary greatly and 
many are still in the early stages of development, the language in this bill fails to 
differentiate between any existing or future “chemical, ” “molecular, ” or “advanced ” 
recycling processes in which the plastic is chemically processed at the molecular level 
into a recycled resin or monomer with the material going back into a feedstock for use in 
new products, rather than as a fuel source. We therefore advocate for more specific 
language in the bill that clearly differentiates use of waste plastics for fuel or energy 
creation, which result in the permanent consumption of a resource, from material-to- 
material recycling processes, which conserve resources for continued use, whether that 
process be accomplished through “mechanical, ” “chemical, ” or other “advanced ” 
recycling.

Lastly, it is worth noting that the term, “advanced recycling, ” is not widely accepted as 
an appropriate term for non-mechanical “chemical ” or “molecular ” recycling processes, 
as it suggests a process that is more “advanced ” technologically than mechanical 
recycling. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
