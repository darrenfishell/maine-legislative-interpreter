TO: Joint Committee on Labor and Housing FROM: William Steele, Professor Emeritus of Theatre, University of Southern Maine (wsteele@maine.edu) .RE: In Support of LD 891, An Act to Protect Due Process for Certain Public Sector Employees Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, Members of the Committee: My name is William Steele. After graduating with undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Maine at At Orono in 1967, I began teaching at what is now the University of Southern Maine and retired after 49 years of service in 2016. During my tenure, I was Chair of the Theatre Department in rotation with colleagues, served on many major committees, developed and taught several courses to thousands of students, directed plays, wrote books, held positions on community and state boards and commissions, including the Maine Arts Commission and the New England Foundation for the Arts. In the final quarter of my tenure I served on USM’s AFUM board, helped affected faculty with grievances,  and became it’s campus president.  It was during this time that I became aware of Loudermill v Cleveland Board of Education, which addresses the Constitutional Rights of public employees and which, in my experience, the University chose not to follow. At no time did the University formally inform faculty of Loudermill and pledge to follow it during disputes. This, in my opinion, not only harmed faculty and staff, but also students and the university at large. It still does. Quality education at any level can only thrive in an atmosphere of trust. LD 891 will help insure that it does in the University of Maine system.
