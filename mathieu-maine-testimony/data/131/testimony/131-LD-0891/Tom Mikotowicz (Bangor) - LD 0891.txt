RE: In Support of LD 891, An Act to Protect Due Process for Certain Public Sector
 Employees Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, Members of the Committee:
	M y  n a m e  i s  T o m  M i k o t o w i c z  a n d  I  a m  c u r r e n t l y  e m p l o y e d  b y  t h e  U n i v e r s i t y  o f  Maine, although I don’t actually go to work right now, which I will explain later in this letter.  I started work at UM in Orono in 1988 and served the university dutifully in my role as professor.  I was chair of the Theatre/Dance division twice, and was the first director of the School of Performing Arts.  I served on countless university committees and served on the board of the Hudson Museum.  Almost a third of my thirty-year career was spent as an administrator.  I taught many theatre and performance studies classes over my many years, and I directed major play and musical productions as part of my teaching responsibilities.  I also advocated serving the state, which is part of the institution’s mission, by sending out touring productions to the elementary and high schools in the state, as well as by selecting shows that were appropriate educational vehicles for school bus-in performances.  Under my supervision, thousands of Maine students saw their first live theatre performance.  Furthermore, I was in the process of creating graduate courses for the high school theatre teachers in the state that would help them get their certification to teach theatre, before I was wrongfully terminated.  I have published extensively, and served as President of the New England Theatre Conference, and was inducted into the New England Theatre Conference College of Fellows.  I worked hard for UMaine and took pride in my work.
	I n  2 0 1 7 ,  I  w a s  p u t  u n d e r  m y  f i r s t  E E O  i n v e s t i g a t i o n  f o r  v i o l a t i n g  T i t l e  9 ,  a n d  w a s  found not guilty of violating any Title 9 offenses.  In 2018, I was put on “administrative leave while being put under my second EEO investigation, and, subsequently, again was found not guilty of violating any Title 9 offenses.  After that investigation, I was “Welcomed Back”, as they called it, to the university and my job.  I taught one summer course.  At the end of summer, and after a new President came to UM, I was told that I was being put on administrative leave again, even though there were no new complaints against me and I survived two EEO investigations.  That Fall of 2018, I was met with a purported fact-finding committee and although there was no resulting report written to which I could respond. I was subsequently terminated in March of 2019.  
	I  c a n n o t  g o  i n t o  a l l  o f  t h e  a b s u r d i t i e s  o f  m y  s u p p o s e d  i n v e s t i g a t i o n  b y  t h e  university, but, suffice it to say, that I went through the same process that Professor Tony Brinkley went through, and at about the same time.  I was denied my “due 
process” rights.  The university concocted twenty some allegations against me that I had to respond to in a 1 1/2 hour meeting.  Many of the allegations were factually wrong and in some cases blatantly false.  I was not told who my accusers were of specific charges, nor was I told when and where the supposed infractions happened.  They were  just general attacks on my teaching and directing. Luckily, in arbitration, I addressed each of the charges, proving them false and without merit.  Of course, as Tony Brinkley did, I won the arbitration and the university was ordered to give me my job back in June 2022.  The arbitration judge stated that the university proved nothing.  Since that time, the university expressed an interest in not having me come back to teach, but in making an offer so that I would retire. I am still waiting to hear from UMS.  In addition, I have a pending lawsuit against them, for violating my due process and other rights.
	T h e  U n i v e r s i t y  o f  M a i n e  i s  i n  m o s t  r e s p e c t s  a  g r e a t  i n s t i t u t i o n .   B u t ,  i n  m y  c a s e ,  t h e   administrators, by violating my rights and not allowing me my due process, wrecked my career.  They made it virtually impossible for me to get hired anywhere else.  They  publicly destroyed my character by leaking details to the media about my investigations, which are supposed to be private personnel matters.  The enormous effect of my wrongful termination was devastating to me, not to mention my family. 
	T h e  t a x p a y e r s  o f  M a i n e ,  o f  w h i c h  I  a m  o n e ,  s h o u l d  b e  a n g r y  a t  t h e  m i l l i o n s  o f  dollars being wasted in legal and settlement fees that go into these doomed investigations of dedicated faculty by administrators who ignore due process.  As a supervisor of a Department I was never advised that the faculty I supervised had Loudermill rights.  Also, as an employee, who has been subject to a six year “nightmare," I have never been advised by the University of my due process rights, which have been consistently violated with sabotage interviews, no pre-termination hearing, and no post-termination hearing.   None of this would have happened had I, and Tony Brinkley, gotten a fair hearing by UMS.  Thus, I can attest that in my opinion, LD 891 is an important bill to get passed immediately.
