LD 163
Dear respected members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Legislative Committee.
My name is Tyler Brown and I am writing in opposition of LD 163, an Act to 
Increase Communication Between the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
and Lifetime License Holders by Requiring Free License Renewals Under Certain 
Circumstances.
I understand that the need for this legislation is to gain better communication between
lifetime license holders and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to 
understand how many lifetime license holders are using their lifetime licenses.
What I do not understand is the need to attach a penalty of a class E crime and fine to 
a lifetime license holder or the need for better communication between IFW and 
license users. There is already a requirement for lifetime license user to tag their big 
game quarry. Turkey, black bear, moose and whitetail deer are the most managed and 
tracked species in Maine. All of these big game animals are required to be tagged by 
hunters, annual or lifetime license holders.
Attaching a fine to a lifetime license user is unnecessary, should better 
communication be needed, lifetime license users should be given the opportunity to 
voluntarily provide this information rather than forced through use of criminal 
repercussions.
The vast majority of Maine hunters consider themselves conservationists and  have 
the utmost respect wildlife and IFW. Criminalizing hunters for not reporting their 
usage of a lifetime license, should not be considered the best way to gain better 
communication from them.
Thank you very much for your time in reading my testimony.
