LD 163 
“An Act to Increase Communication Between the Department o f Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and 
Lifetime License Holders by Requiring Free License Renewals Under Certain Circumstances ”  
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife  
 
Public Hearing Date: February 6, 2023  
Testimony Against LD 163  
 
Senator LaFountain , Representative Landry  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife . My name is Shira Burns and I represent th e Maine Prosecutors 
Association. I am here to testify against LD 163 solely in regard to any criminal offenses  that are 
associated with this bill.  
 
The criminal justice system is  facing a large backlog of criminal cas es because of the pandemic, 
which  has been  compounded with the  lack of defense counsel  available to represent indigent 
defendants . Prosecutor s’ workload is at an all-time high and sincerely cannot take on more cases .  
 
Furthermore, in this legislative session, as in last, we are advocating to reclassify many inland 
fishery  and wildlife crim inal offenses to civil violations . Criminal offenses have many unatte nded 
collateral consequence beside s a criminal convicti on. Since public safety is not jeopardized if a 
person violates this proposed legislation, the Maine Prosecutors Association  urges you  not to 
criminalize this behavior.  In lieu of a criminal offense being a penalty, o ther consequences can be 
adjudged such  as a minimum  mandatory  $500 fine that cannot be waived or an I nland Fishery and 
Wildlife license suspension .  
 
For these reasons, the Maine Prosecutors Association is against LD 163 in regard to enacting a new 
criminal offense.
