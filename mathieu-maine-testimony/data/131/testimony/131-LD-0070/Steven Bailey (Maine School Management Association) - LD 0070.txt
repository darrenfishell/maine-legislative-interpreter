TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 70  
 
AN ACT TO ELIMINATE THE CAP ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AND 
TEACHER S TO WHICH A COST -OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT IS MADE  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and member s of the Committee on Labor and Housing. I am  Steve n 
Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association  and the Maine School Boards 
Association , representing the legislative committee s of the M aine School Boards Association and Maine 
School Superintendents Association in support of L.D. 70.  
 
This legislation reverses an unfair and harmful decision that cap ped cost-of-living increases for retirees in the 
teacher retirement plan,  which includes te achers and superintendents , at just over $24,000 . It was adopted  at 
the time  to save money  to balance the state budget.  
 
It was unfair and disrespectful to our teachers and superintendents at the time  and remains even more so 
today . The cost-of-living for our retired staff , many of whom  are on fixed incomes , is going up.  
 
This bill provide s that cost-of-living increases for retired state employees and educators  and their beneficiaries 
apply to a retiree â€™s entire retirement benefit instead of only to the firs t $24,186 . That is fair and it is the right 
thing to do for those in the teach ing profession, many of whom retired still making relatively low wages .
