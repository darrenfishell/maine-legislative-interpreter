Testimony of Rep. Jan Dodge presenting 
LD 70, An Act to Eliminate the Cap on Retirement Beneﬁts for State Employees and Teachers 
to Which a Cost of Living Adjustment is Made 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Good afternoon. I am Representative Jan Dodge from House District 39, which includes Belfast, 
Noithport and Belmont. I am here to present LD 70, An Act to Eliminate the Cap on 
Retirement Beneﬁts for State Employees and Teachers to Which a Cost Of Living 
Adjustment is Made. 
This bill would further amend Section 1.5 MRSA 17806, sub 1, A as amended by PL 2021,0635, 
Pt.NNl to match the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index with an equal percentage 
increase in retirement beneﬁts by applying that percentage to a retiree’s entire yearly beneﬁt. 
This will begin to help pensions to truly stay on par with inﬂation. 
In July 2011, the amount to which the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) was applied equaled 
$20,000. This was later adjusted for inﬂation. In July 2022 the COLA amount applied to 
$24,186.25 of a retiree’s pension. LD 70 will eliminate the capped amount, as proposed in LD 
703 in the 130"“ Legislature. 
With current inﬂation rates in the 7%-9. 1% range, those who worked for the State of Maine and 
those who worked as educators have been asked, once again, to absorb ﬁnancial impacts and 
help balance budgets. 
I am experiencing de’ja vu as I speak to you. March 2017 was one of the times I spoke in support 
of a fairer COLA here in the State House. Back then I illustrated the need by explaining that in 
my ﬁrst six (6) years of retirement and after a thirty-one (31) year teaching career, my pension 
increased $12.71. In eleven years my Maine Public Employee Pension had increased $3 02.96, or 
an average yearly increase of $27.54. I’m sure my grocery bill, gas costs and #2 heating oil 
increases exceeded this amount. This situation is not uncommon for retirees! 
In addition, please remember that these are the same people: 
District 39: Belfast, Belmont & Northport
0 Who were forced into the Maine Public Employee Retirement System (MEPERS) and 
not allowed to join Social Security. 
0 Whose normal retirement age has been raised several times from 59 and a ‘/2, to 60 to 62 
and for some 65. Yes, this does indeed mean some will work for thirty (30), thirty-ﬁve 
(35), or forty (40) years and still sustain a permanent penalty in their yearly pension for 
not reaching the moving goal post that is the statutory age of retirement. 
0 Who may have fewer years in the work force because they took time away from their job 
to care for their kids. Fewer years equals a smaller pension and this aspect particularly 
affects women. 
0 Who have higher healthcare costs because they are paying 45% of their coverage from 
their monthly beneﬁt check. 
0 Who are only this year beginning to move to tax parity with Social Security exemptions. 
6 Who worked second jobs or came to teaching after another career and are now dealing 
with income/bene ﬁt reductions through the Federal Windfall Elimination Provision 
(WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). 
Please understand that any of the aforementioned situations causes retiree concern. Collectively, 
they create a ﬁnancial nightmare for retired state workers and retired educators. Please pass LD 
70 to create pension justice for Maine retirees. 
Thank you. 
District 39: Belfast, Belmont & Northport
