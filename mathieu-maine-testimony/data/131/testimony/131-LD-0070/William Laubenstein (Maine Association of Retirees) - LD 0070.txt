SUBJECT: LD '70, An Act to Eliminate the Cap on Retirement Beneﬁts for State Employees and Teachers to 
Which a Cost-of -living Adjustment is made. 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing. My 
name is William H. Laubenstein, III. I am President of the Maine Association of Retirees (MAR) whose 
membership includes retired State employees, retired teachers and other public service retirees. 
MAR supports LD 70, An Act to Eliminate the Cap on Retirement Beneﬁts for State Employees and Teachers to 
Which a Cost-of-living Adjustment is made. Prior to 2011, the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) was made on the full 
retirement beneﬁt and the COLA was capped at 4%. Pursuant to PL. 201 1, Ch. 380, the COLA adjustment would 
apply on to the ﬁrst $20,000 indexed of a retiree’s beneﬁt. The indexed amount for 2022 was $24,186.25. 
It is MAR’s understanding that the 2011 change was one of the changes made to balance the budget as required by 
the Maine Constitution and that the change was never meant to apply to future years. This change, in addition to the 
reduction of the maximum COLA increase from 4% to 3% has had a severe adverse impact on the State and teacher 
retirees who for the most part live on ﬁxed incomes. It is worthy of note in this regard that the maximum COLA 
increase for retirees covered by the plan for the Participating Local District Consolidated Plan (PLD) is 2.5% and is 
applied to the entire beneﬁt. See 5 M.R.S., sec. 18407. Equity in the treatment of Maine public service retirees 
requires that retired State and teacher employees be entitled to a COLA applied to the entire pension beneﬁt. 
Further, with regard to the COLA adjustment for 2022, the rate of inﬂation in 2022 dramatically out-paced the State 
3% cap on the COLA adjustment and worked additional hardship on public service retirees. There is no better 
example of the inadequacy of a 3% adjustment than the 8.7% COLA adjustment for persons receiving a Social 
Security retirement beneﬁt. While LD 70 does not fully put State and teacher retirees in the same position they had 
in 2011, it is a good ﬁrst step in alleviating the ﬁnancial challenges retirees. 
Thank you for your consideration of this testimony. I would be happy to answer your questions and MAR will be 
available for your work session.
