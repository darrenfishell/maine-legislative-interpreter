LD 70
Senator Tipping, Representative Rader, and Members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee,
My name is Bob Jean from Rockland.  I am a retired teacher with 38 years of service.  
I speak today in favor of LD70.  I am currently President of the Knox County Retired 
Educators Association and President-Elect for Maine Education Association-Retired.  I hear 
about this particular issue from many members locally and state-wide,  
The COLA cap established in 2011 continues to erode retirees' pensions, especially when the
rate of inflation is sky high.  Additionally, the COLA is only applied to the first $24,900 of a 
retiree's pension. We continue to fall behind as the value of our pensions decrease and our 
buying power shrinks.
Retired educators are often thanked for their past service.  That is admirable but does not 
paint the whole picture.  Retirees still provide valuable service to their communities and the 
State.  We are retired-not expired.
There is a high rate of volunteerism among retired educators. During the pandemic retired 
teachers stepped up big time.  Some became mentors for active teachers who were 
struggling with the almost impossible tasks they had to deal with.  Many of us volunteered in 
schools and continue to do so because we see the overwhelming needs.  Other retired 
educators answered the call and began substituting to help address teacher and ESP 
shortages.  Finally, some headed back into the workforce as they saw the need to correct 
these devastating shortages.  Retired-not expired.
This sounds like a group of people who are deserving of a fair COLA on the entire amount of 
their pensions.  Their past, and continued, service to our State should/could be more fully 
recognized.  A good start would be consideration of LD70.  We trust that sincere 
consideration and efforts will be made to begin fixing this frustrating situation.
Thank you for time and service to the State of Maine!
