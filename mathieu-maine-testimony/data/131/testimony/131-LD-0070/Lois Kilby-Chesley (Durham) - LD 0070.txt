LD 70
To Labor and Housing Committee
From Lois Kilby-Chesley       2/14/2023
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and Housing 
Committee.
My name is Lois Kilby-Chesley, and I am writing to you from my home in Durham, 
ME.
I am writing in support of LD 70 - An Act to Eliminate the Cap on Retirement 
Benefits for State Employees and Teachers to Which a Cost-of-living Adjustment Is 
Made.
This bill fixes an unfair change to state employee and teacher retirement that was 
made in 2011. The bill will allow a teacherâ€™s retirement to increase up to 3% without 
a  monetary cap according to the CPI in any year.
For anyone living outside the restrictions in the current law, they might ask why such 
a small change is necessary.  I will tell you that as a teacher retiree whose finances are
affected by even the smallest change - every penny counts.
I consider myself frugal - others might say a cheapskate - and shop carefully, if at all. 
Yet, the benefits I receive, MEPERS and reduced Social Security due to GPO/WEP, 
only barely meet the most basic of costs.
I hope that you will find it in your heart to vote in support of LD 70.  
Thank you for the work you do for all Maine educators and other residents.
