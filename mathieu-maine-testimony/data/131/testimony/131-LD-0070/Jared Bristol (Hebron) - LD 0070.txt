LD 70
I taught your middle school children for 25 years with 3 degrees in science, 
psychology, and half a Masters in education for very minimal wages considering.  As 
per usual, my retirement benefits are squeezed while inflation eats up double or triple 
any COLA.  How about treating us better?  I ask that you "Ought to Pass" this bill, 
LD-70.  Now, at age 77, things are difficult for my wife (also a retired teacher of 32 
years 2nd grade) to get by and anything would help.  How about reducing lots of other
spendthrift spending instead?
