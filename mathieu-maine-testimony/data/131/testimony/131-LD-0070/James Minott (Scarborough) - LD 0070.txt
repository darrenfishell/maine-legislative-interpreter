To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to express my support for LD 70 which would allow the COLA to be 
applied to State retirees and educators on their entire retirement benefit instead of 
only to the first $24,186.15. 
Over the past 20 years, the year-to-year increase in the gross distribution of my state 
pension has not come close to matching the rate of inflation.  In 2002 my pension was
$56,419 and in 2022 my pension’s gross distribution was $59,349.  This is an increase
in twenty years of $2,929, meaning that it has increased only 5.19% over this time 
period.
According to several reputable sources I found online, the inflation rate during this 
same twenty year period has been roughly 65%.  This is a vast, and almost 
unbelievable, difference from what I have received for COLA increases; 65% versus 
5.19%.
While the cost for everyday needs has been steady and dramatically increasing, I am 
falling financially further and further behind each year.
I urge you to support LD 70 for all of Maine’s Public Service Retirees.
Sincerely,
James E. Minott
