To: Senator Baldacci, Rep Meyer and Members of the Health and Human Services Committee. 
Subject LD-775 an Act to Require and Standardize Labeling of Water Treatment Equipment. 
My apologies l could not be there in person but with short notice, I regret lam unable to move my 
schedule. 
As a home inspector l have personally witnessed home owners who do not know what their water 
treatment equipment is treating, how long it will last and how often it should be sen/iced. In many cases 
the equipment is not properly functioning and consumers are drinking infected water or causing 
premature mechanical equipment failure because of the lack of knowledge. Labeling this equipment can 
assist in understanding who, what, when and how often it should be serviced. Currently PFAS (forever 
chemical) equipment is not being labeled in all the cases I have seen during my home inspections. 
I have no personal gain in the submission of this bill. 
Most all water treatment companies install this equipment without applying for a permit from the town 
and therefore the equipment is not inspected by local code enforcement. Requiring a tag that also 
includes the permit # as well as the company information will help the State Plumbing inspector (Mike 
Day) as well. 
HVAC companies apply a service tag the boilers and furnaces, Radon equipment installers are required 
to label their Radon mitigation equipment. 
The estimated cost for a service tag is .10-.25 cents each and I believe this would help with public safety 
of the water they consume. 
Thank you for the consideration
