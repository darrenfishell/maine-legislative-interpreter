I urge you to reconsider the new deadline which would be implemented if this were to pass as
is. You are effectively removing 10 weeks of time for signature collecting and placing an 
undue burden on smaller parties that seek office. 
The reduction in needed signatures is a huge win for our representative process and 
shouldn't be tainted by such a dramatic reduction in time. 
I urge you to strengthen our representative process and pass this legislation with the 
exception that you remove the shortened time frame. 
Thank you,
Harrison Kemp
