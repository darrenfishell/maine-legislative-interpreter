Federal and state government should be encouraging the kind of experimental 
passenger-rail operations envisioned by Midcoast Railservice (MCRI) in lieu of 
problematic academic feasibility studies.  The Rockland Branch represents a compact 
testing laboratory for all collaborating parties:   (1) MDOT, to generate a substantive 
return on sunk infrastructure investment reportedly exceeding $63-million; (2) 
NNEPRA, to test passenger-market receptivity to an intrastate travel option and 
prospective “Downeaster” interstate connectivity; (3) Amtrak, as a possible 
contract-operator model for extending system reach into other outlying light-density 
markets,; and (4) CSX, to stimulate branch-line carload freight traffic and improve 
capacity utilization of its newly acquired New England regional lines.  
This public-private initiative, to run through 2025, is being frustrated by two 
unforeseen impediments:  (1) a legislated state mandate for all scheduled 
passenger-rail services to be subject to a liability limit of $75-million, which is (a) 
prohibitive for a contracting short-line operator and (b) inconsistent with far lower 
exposure for competing bus and taxi operators, and (2) a further deterrent to a 
cost-effective pilot test from regulatory insistence on upgrades to modernized 
equipment that were not applicable to its prior use in far more demanding Texas 
inter-city service as recently as 2017.   These unexpected issues frustrate prompt 
implementation of desires expressed by NNEPRA as far back as 2016 and result in 
unnecessary cost of a definitive short-term experiment of value to the State of Maine.
