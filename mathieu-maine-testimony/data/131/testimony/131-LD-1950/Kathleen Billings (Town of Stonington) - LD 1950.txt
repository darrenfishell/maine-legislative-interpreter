RE’: Ll) I950 
Dear Honorable Senator Lawrence, Senator Grohoski, Senator Harrington, Representative 
Babin, Representative Boyle, Representative Dunphy and other members of the Committee 
on Energy, Utilities, and Technology 
This letter is to enthusiastically support LD 1950, “An Act lo Raise the Debt Lnmt of the 
Slonmglon Water Company“ . This emergency legislation is imperative in order for the 
Stonington Water Company to continue desperatelymeederl infrastructure improvements. 
Much of Stonmgton Water Company’ s infrastructure dates“ back to the early l900s when 
the system was ﬁrst built."l'he§e aneient transmission lines have long ago exceeded their 
useful life. Stonington Water Company has been aggressively pursuing grants to replace 
the old pipes and, with the help of engineering ﬁrm Olver Associates, has successfully been 
awarded several signiﬁcant grants to achieve these goals. However, the work must 
continue, and grant funrls alone cannot cover all necessary costs Raising the Debt Limit by 
approving Ll) 1950 is a critical component ‘ to keeping these projects on track. 
We, both as Selectboard of the Town of Stonington, as well as Trustees ofthe Stonington 
Water Company, urge you to support and approve this bill. 
Respectfully, 
Donna Brewer E elyn~Duncan
