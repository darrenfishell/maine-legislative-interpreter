In Support of LD 1950, “An Act to Ra1se the Debt Limlt of the Stonlngton Water Company” 
Before the Commlttee on Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Technology 
18 May 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representat1ve Zelgler, and fellow members of the Jo1nt 
Stand1ng Comm1ttee on Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Technology As you lmow, my name 1s N1cole 
Grohoskr and I am honored to represent the 22 commun1t1es of Senate D1str1ct 7 I am here 1n 
support of LD 1950, “An Act to Ra1se the Debt L11n1t of the Stomngton Water Company” 
Thls b1ll would amend the Pnvate and Spec1al Laws govemmg the Stonmgton Water Company 
to rncrease the debt l1m1t from $1 m1ll1on to $10 m1ll1on dollars The debt lnmt was last 1ncreased 
1n 1989, from $250,000 to $1 m1l11on I’m sure you W111 agree that the cost of bu1ld1ng 
lnfrastructure has gone up a b1t 1n the past 34 years 
Stonlngton 1s on the 1sland of Deer Isle, Wh1ch, 11ke much of Ma1ne’s coastl1ne, 1s bedrock w1th 
11m1ted groundwater resources Last summer, due to drought cond1t1ons and hrgher demand from 
tour1sts and summer res1dents, the town of Stomngton faced a ser1ous water shortage and had to 
truck 1n hundreds of thousands of gallons of drlnkmg water at great expense to water users 
The town has undertaken a hydrology study and would 11ke to bu1ld a larger water tank to 
prevent future shortages The town 1s also workmg wlth the federal delegatron to secure ﬁmdmg 
for needed upgrades 
The Stomngton Water Company has been workmg on a reﬁnancmg plan 1n order to be able to 
contract for cnt1cal mfrastructure upgrades They have been adv1sed by the Ma1ne Bond Bank 
and the1r own Bond Counsel that th1s debt l1m1t 1ncrease 1s necessary for them to complete the 
work they’ve been do1ng to protect the1r ab1l1ty to prov1de water 
T1me 1s of the essence for the Stomngton Water Company to be able to s1gn contracts at currently 
negot1ated pr1ces, so I respectfully ask th1s commlttee to vote Ought to Pass as soon as poss1ble 
Thank you for your attentlon and I am happy to answer any questrons you may have
