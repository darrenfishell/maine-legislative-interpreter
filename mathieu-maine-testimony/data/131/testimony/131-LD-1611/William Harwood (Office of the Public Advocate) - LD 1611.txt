LD 1611, “An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit, Customer -
owned Utility ” 
May 4 , 2023 
 
Senator  Lawrence , Representative  Zeigler  and distinguished m embers of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities , and Technology,  
 My name is William Harwood, testif ying as Public Advocate  neither for nor against  
LD 1611 , “An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit, Customer -owned 
Utility .” 
 The Office of the Public Advocate has carefully considered this ini tiative. Assuming 
it will be on the ballot next November for voters to decide whether it should become law, 
the OPA has decided to take no position on this bill at this time. However, the OPA has 
responded to a number of questions about the proposal and our office will continue to do so 
throughout the next six months. We hope to serve as a trusted source of information to 
voters who seek a greater understanding of the proposal.   
 The OPA will be available for  the work session to assist the Committee in its 
consideration of this bill  and answer any technical questions the Committee may have . 
 
Respectfully  submitted , 
    
William S. Harwood  
Public Advocate
