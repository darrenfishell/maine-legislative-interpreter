LD 1611
Good Friends of the EUT Committee: I have spent years speaking with Mainers about
the benefits of  Pine Tree Power, a Consumer Owned Utility for all of Maine, and 
securing signatures for the referendum. I pray you use your authority to recommend 
the whole legislature vote to approve this bill, as they have in the past, but the 
governor neglected to sign it into law. Please remedy that by approving LD 1611 
without waiting for a November vote.
Pine Tree Power would better serve all Mainers by offering lower cost, more reliable 
electric power, and facilitating a rapid transition to green energy, while easing our 
universal broad band development, using utility poles we would then own. Many 
Mainers already enjoy these benefits from local COUs; Pine Tree Power would 
ensure ALL Mainers reap these benefits.
