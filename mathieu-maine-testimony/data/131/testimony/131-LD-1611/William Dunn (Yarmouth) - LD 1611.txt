 TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. DUNN, JR. 
IN SUPPORT OF PINE TREE POWER  
BEFORE THE ENERGY , UTILITIES & TECHNOLOGY (EUT)  COMMITTEE  
MAY 4, 2023 
 
Senator Lawrence,  Representative Zeigler , and members of the Joint  Committee on Energy, Utilities, and 
Technology:   My na me is Bill Dunn and  I reside in Yarmouth,  Maine.   I previously testified before your 
committee on May  20, 2021 in support of L .D. 1708, the earlier Pine Tree Power (PTP) Legislation , and 
on February  22, 2022 in opposition to L .D. 1959, a hast ily drafted an d pale imitation  of L .D. 1708.  
Copies of both of th ose testimonies are attached to the written version of this testimony.  
 
I am filing this testimony in support of L.D. 1611 , “An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a 
Nonprofit, Customer -owned Utili ty.”  I am the President and sole employee of Sunse t Point, LLC , but I 
am filing this testimony as an unpaid citizen of Maine who is fed -up with my continuing poor electric 
service . 
 
I have over 50 years of experience in the electric  power industry.  Since  1989 I have been consulting 
throughout the U nited States and worldwide in more than 25  countries on issues associated w ith 
electricity market design and implementation, ancillary services, utility and electricity market operations, 
inter-utility coordinat ion, contractual power supply arrangements, and transmission access and pricing.   
As indicated in previous testimony , in all that time I have seldom, if eve r, seen such poorly performing 
electric utilities in a developed country as are the large electric u tilities in Maine.  My short bio is attached 
to my February  22, 2022 testimony  as Attachment  A. 
 
The purpose of this brief  testimony is to update my previous testimony.  As documented in my previous 
testimony, Maine electricity customers have l ived with th e worst reliability and lowest customer 
satisfaction in the U nited States for many, many years.  I’m here to tell you it has not gotten better.  
 
Since the 2020 reliability data contained i n my p revious testimony was issued by the US Energy 
Infor mation A dministration (EIA), showing the poor  performance  of CMP and Versant, the EIA  has 
issued data for 2021 (the 2022 dat a will come out in October 2023).  According to that data, ignoring 
Major Event Days, Maine customers still experience the 6th most outage minu tes and the 3rd the greatest  
number of outages in the U nited States. 
 
Also, JD  Power had done additional  customer satisfaction surveys since the 2021 data contained in my 
previous testimony  that demonstrated CMP ’s and Versant ’s bottom of the barrel ratings .  The 202 2 data 
shows that, with respect to residen tial customer satisfaction, out of 120 utilities ranked, CMP was 119th 
and Versant was 118th.  Yes, Maine has 2 of the 3 lowest rated utilities!  With respect to business 
customer satisfaction, CMP was 76th out 76 utilities ranked (i.e. , dead last).  And , there was quite a bit of 
space and the 75th ranked utili ty with a 710 rating and CMP, with a 597 rating .  Versant has too few 
business customers to receive a business customer satisfaction rating.  
 
So, in  conclusion, the performance of CMP and Versant is not improving and the need for  Pine Tree 
Power is stronger than ever.  Just think how reliability and customer satisfaction could be im proved if all 
the Maine ratepayer money flowing to their foreign owner s was kept in Maine and invested in the system.  
 
The EUT should feel free to contact me if they would like addition al information or would like to discuss 
my views further.   My contact details are in the previous ly referenced Attachment  A to my attached 
February  22, 2022 test imony.

 TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. DUNN, JR. 
IN OPPOSITION TO LD 1959  
BEFORE THE ENERGY , UTILITIES & TECHNOLOGY (EUT)  COMMITTEE  
FEBRUARY  22, 2022  
 
Senator Lawrence,  Representative Berry, and members of the Joint  Committee on Energy, Utilities, and 
Technology:   My nam e is Bill Dunn and  I reside in Yarmouth,  Maine.   I previously testified before your 
committee on May  20, 2021 in support of LD  1708, the Pine Tree Power (PTP) Legislation .  I am filing 
this testimony in opposition to L.D. 1959 , “An Act To Ensure Transmissi on and Distribution Utility 
Accountability, ” a hastily drafted and pale imitation of LD  1708 , which itself underwent three years of 
painstaking review .  I am the President and sole employee of Sunse t Point, LLC , but I am filing this 
testimony as an unpaid citizen of Maine who is fed -up with my poor electric service . 
 
I have over 50 years of experience in the electric  power industry.  Since 1989 I have been consulting 
throughout the U nited States and worldwide in more than 25  countries on issues associated w ith 
electricity market design and implementation, ancillary services, utility and electricity market operations, 
inter-utility coordination, contractual power supply arrangements, and transmission access and pricing.   In 
all that time I have seldom, if eve r, seen such poorly performing electric utilities in a developed country 
as are the large electric utilities in Maine.  My short bio is attached to this testimony  as Attachment  A. 
 
In my view, LD  1959 has been introduced to try to paper over the ill-advise d veto last year of LD  1708.  
The drafters of LD  1959 are hoping that people of Maine will fail to understand that LD  1959 is really a 
way for the Maine Investor -Owned Utilities ( IOUs ) to continue failing the people of Maine , just like they 
have done consi stently for many years .  Just think, if LD  1708  had been allowed to go into effect, the 
Maine people would probably have approved the formation of PTP last November at the same time they 
rejected Central Maine Power Company’s ( CMP’s ) corridor project and w e would be well on our way to 
forming a Consumer -Owned Utility (COU) to serve the interest of Mainers and not the foreign 
government  owners of CMP and Versant Power (Versant) . 
 
In a just world, CMP and Versant would already cease to exist because of their long-term and continuing 
poor performance , as demonst rated below.   They would have  had their monopoly franchises revoked and 
been bought out by competent management or, preferably, been converted to a COU.   But that has not 
happened.  
 
All that said, the m ain purpose of my testimony is to point out that putting our faith in the Maine Public 
Utilities Commission ( PUC ) to hold the State’s IOUs, CMP  and Versant, accountable is, literally, like 
placing the fox in charge of the henhouse.  It appears that t he PUC , like many regulatory agencies, has 
been captured by the entities which it is supposed to be regulating.  Even if the PUC  had not been 
captured, it lacks the experienced staff and access to independent information to hold the feet of CMP and 
Versant to th e fire.   Consistently , the IOUs have manipulated our regulators by using their control over 
crucial information and their huge advantage in person -power to dominate  the PUC  staff.  
 
You may ask how I can say this?  All you have to do is look at the excrucia tingly poor performance of 
CMP and Versant over the years, and the lack of effective PUC  efforts to do anything about it, to know 
the PUC  has not , despite possibly the best intentions,  been capable of holding CMP and Versant 
accountable for their worst (or near worst) in the nation reliability and customer satisfaction.  
 
February  22, 2022 William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony  
 
Sunset Point, LLC  2 
 It is encouraging that last week the PUC  launched an investigation into CMP management1.  This 
investigation wa s apparently triggered by last year’s damning report from the Liberty Consulti ng Group2.  
However, CMP is quoted in the Footnote  1 article as saying that “it has consistently improved customer 
service over the past four years ” and the PUC lifted an existing financial penalty “c iting the company’s 
recent customer service improvements .”  As the information below will demonstrate, that is far from the 
case.  
 
Reliability  
 
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes reliability data by State and composite data 
for the country every October.  Therefore, the latest data publish ed in October 2021 is for 2020 .  Exhibit  1 
shows the data for that year as compiled by the American Public Power Association (APPA).  Note that 
there is a dropdown option in the actual spreadsheet to selec t different States, and  I have selected to have 
the Maine  data shown .  When reviewing this data several definitions are helpful:  
 
Acronym  Definition  What it means  
MED  Major Event Days  An interruption or series of interruptions that exceed reasonable 
design and/or operational limits of the electric power s ystem.   In 
general, this seems to be days with outages longer than 24  hours.  
SAIDI  System Average 
Interruption 
Duration Index  The total sustained interruption duration for the average customer 
during a predefined period of time.  SAIDI can be viewed as th e 
total amount of time the average customer can expect to be out of 
service each year.  
CAIDI  Customer Average 
Interruption 
Duration Index  The average outage duration that any given customer would 
experience  for each outage .  CAIDI can also be viewed as th e 
average restoration time.  
SAIFI  System Average 
Interruption 
Frequency Index  The average number of interruptions that a customer would 
experience each year.  
 
An an alysis of the data in Exhibit  1 is quite instructive.  Looking at the reliability data cal culated in 
accordance with the standards of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), both with 
and without Major Event Days  (MEDs) , demonstrates Maine’s poor IOU performance compared to IOUs 
in other States and to Public Power utilitie s:

CAIDI  Minutes out/outage (restore time)  114.86  120.47  86.43  
 
As striking as that table is for demonstrating the failures of Maine’s IOUs, the failure is even more 
apparent when you include Major Event Days:

 2020  Outages With Major Event Days  
 
Acronym  Description  U.S. IOUs  Maine IOUs  Public Power  
SAIFI  Number of outages/year  1.53 3.92 1.16 
SAIDI  Total outage minutes/year  462.36  1,688 .40 209.60 
CAIDI  Minutes out/outage (restore time)  249.70  432.40  139.89  
 
Graphically , the data with MEDs : 
 
Number of Outages/year      Total outage minutes/year          Minutes out/o utage  
 
 
As you can see, in 2020  the Maine customers of CMP and Versant experienced almost four times the 
minutes of outages, including MEDs, as the customers of IOUs elsewhere in the US ( more than 28  hours 
of outages), and the average duration of each i ndividual outage (more than 7  hours) was almost twice as 
long.  As can also be seen, public power entities performed much better than IOUs in general, with less 
than half the outage minutes each year.  
 
Why was the reliability of Maine’s IOUs so poor?  I am  sure CMP and Versant will say it was because 
Maine has such bad weather and lots of trees  (ignoring the fact that the vast majority of Maine’s trees are 
in the less populated parts of the State) .  How disingenuous.  Lots of States have lots of trees and b ad 
weather, and Maine does not, for the most part, have hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, huge fires, etc.  
So, let’s compare Maine’s 2020  IOU reliability with other New England States, with and without Major 
Event Days  (organized by average minutes of o utages/year) .

Even in New England, M aine and Connecticut stood out for their poor reliability in 2020 .  Unlike Maine, 
however, Connecticut was hit by Tropical Storm Isaias in August 2020 .  The storm brought more than 
750,000 power outages in Connecticut  and caused Eversource and United Illum inating an estimated $230 
million in damages.   As noted in the asterisk, Vermont’s data is not standard, and they don’t seem to track 
separately outages with and without MEDs.

 Since, as demonstrated above, MEDs can really impact outage rates, let’s look a t New England States 
without MEDs.

Ignoring Verm ont and its non -standard data reporting, Maine IOU customers had 2 to 4 times the outage 
minutes as other New England States.  And Maine’s 2020  reliability was not an aberration.  Here’s a table 
comparing Maine’s IOU reliability with the national averages  of outage minutes for the years 2016 to 
2020 :

Note that customers of Maine’s IOUs are likely to have up to 6  times the outage minutes of the average 
customer of other IOUs in th e U.S. and up to almost 14  times the outage minutes of the average customer 
of U.S. Public Power utilities (e.g.,  Consumer -Owned Utilities ).

So, what has been done about this continuing record of poor reliability?  Essentially, n othing.  The PUC  
has not taken one concrete action against CMP and/or Versant for their poor record of reliability.  
 
Customer Satisfaction  
 
In 2021  J.D. Power again polled residential customers of utilities throughout the United States  as to their 
satisfaction with their utility service .  The polling included the residential customers of both IOUs and 
Consumer -Owned Utilities ( consisting of m unicipals, S tate agencies and cooperatives).  The results of 
this polling show ed the continuing abject failure of Maine’s IOUs to meet  the needs of their customers.  
February  22, 2022 William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony  
 
Sunset Point, LLC  6 
  
In the case of residential customer s, out of 121  utilities rat ed, Versant ranked  tied for 117th and CMP 
ranked  121st.  Yes, that’s right;  in 2021 Maine had  two of the five worst rated utilities in the whole United 
States in terms of residential customer satisfaction.   And, Versant was tied with Pacific Gas & Electric, a 
utility that (i)  twice f iled for bankruptcy; (ii)  is on federal probation for a pipeline explosion, (iii)  was 
charged wi th starting fires that killed 85  people several years ago and (iv)  spent the summer s of 2020 and 
2021 implementing rotating blackouts to limit their chance of s tarting more fires.   Attached as Exhibit  2 is 
a spreadsheet showing the ratings  of all 121  utilities  and a corresponding bar chart (without all the utility 
names to save space)  to demonstrate their failure visually, especially the extent of the drop off fr om the 
119th to the 121st rated utility, CMP . 
 
Note that 2021  was not an unusual year.  In 2020 Versant ranked 140th and CMP was 142nd (dead last) of 
the 142 utilities rated.   In 2019 the two Maine IO Us were  the two lo west rated utilities of the 142  utilit ies 
rated.  In 2018 CMP was slightly better, at 22nd lowest, but Versant (then Emera ) was still the 2nd lowest  
of the 138  utilities rated that year .  The only consistency of CMP and Versant is that they are consistent in 
both having extremely low residenti al customer satisfaction over many years.  
 
Again, what has been done in light of this consistent record of poor customer satisfaction?  Next to 
nothing!  Back in January  2020 the PUC  handed CMP a n 18 month,  $10 million earnings reduction for 
mismanagement of its new billing system ( https://www.pressherald.com/2020/01/30/state -regulator -slaps -
cmp-with-10-million -earnings -reduction/ )3.  At the same time, however, the PUC  also granted CMP a rate 
increase .  According to the PUC , from 2011 to 2020 CMP’s distribution rates increased 15.25% and their 
rates for transmission (admittedly impacted by transmission investments elsewhere in New England  in 
addition to CMP’s own $1.5 billion Maine Power Reliability Program ) increased by 100.18%.  Then, i n 
August 2021 , the PUC  granted CMP yet another 11.5% rate increase  for their delivery services .  The chart 
below shows the CMP rates for various components of their delivery charges over the period 2011 to 
2020  (so it does not reflect the most recent 11.5% rate increase! ).

   EMT = Efficiency Maine Trust  
                                                 
3 According to the artic le in Footnote #1 this penalty w as suspended last week after more than 18  months and 
reaching a total of $12.5 million.  Their reason for lifting the penalty was improvements in CMP service, which 
must have been with respect to the PUC ’s easy to meet rules as any such improvement is obviously NOT  reflected 
by the information in t his testimony .

Measuring Performance  
 
As demonstrated above, there are existing independently collected data against which the performance of 
Maine’s IOUs can be evaluated.  These measurements were included in LD  1708.  Does LD  1959 take 
advantage of t his information?  No!   Instead, it leaves it to the PUC  to develop its own rules for 
evaluating utility performance.  And, it says these will be “routine rules, ” meaning the public will have no 
say in their development and the Legislature will  not have approval authority over them.  
 
Since the PUC  does not have the necessary technical expertise to develop these rules and collect the data 
to evaluate performance, where will these rules and data come from?   My guess is that they will come 
from th e utilities themselves, possibl y via their lobbying arm, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI).  What 
are the chances that the rules will be tough?  
 
Whatever the rules, LD  1959 is extremely vague on how performance against the rules will be actually 
monitored .  The utilities themselves will report quarterly using data they control.  How the six different 
“standards ” will be combined to determine “failures ” is not defined, and neither is what “consistently fails 
to meet a standard.”   As noted in the Footnote  #1 article, in January 2022 the Office of the Public 
Advocate filed information indicating that “three of the four key benchmarks for the company’s 
performance showed nearly consistent retrogression since last February.”  And yet, as indicated earlier, the 
PUC stopped the penalty on CMP for poor performance.  
 
The bottom line is that depending on the unelected and unaccountable PUC  to improve the performance 
of CMP and Versant is a recipe for failure.  LD  1959 does not give the PUC  any powers that they don’t 
already have and that they have failed to exercise in the past.  If the Governor ’s Energy Office and the 
Office of the Public Advocate are  really interested in holding the utilitie s accountable for performance, 
they should replace LD  1959 with an updated v ersion of LD  1708 , maybe the version being circulated as 
part of a petition drive,  and move the  other items in LD  1959 (e.g.,  the whistleblower and climate 
sections) to separate legislation.  
 
The EUT should feel free to contact me if they would like addition al information or would like to discuss 
my views further.

 TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. DUNN, JR. 
BEFORE THE ENERGY , UTILITIES & TECHNOLOGY (EUT)  COMMITTEE  
MAY 20, 2021  
 
Senator Lawrence,  Representative Berry, and members of the Joint  Committee on Energy, Utilities, and 
Technology:   My name is Bill Dunn and  I reside in  Yarmouth,  Maine,  where I and my neighbors 
frequently have to run our standby generator s.  I am filing this testimony in enthusiastic support of 
L.D. 1708, “ An Act To Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit Utility, To Deliver Lower 
Rates, Reliabil ity, and Local Control for Maine Energy Independence. ”  I am the President and sole 
employee of Sunse t Point, LLC , but I am filing this testimony as an unpaid volunteer with Our Power .  I 
have almost 50  years of experience in the electric  power industry.  Briefly, a fter two years at engineering 
firm Stone & Webster (since acquired) I spent the next 16  years split between two New England utilities:  
 
1. Vermont Electric Power Company  (VELCO) , which is the Vermont transmission company 
that represents the Vermo nt distribution utilities in NEPOOL, the New England Power Pool, 
and runs a sub -pool among the Vermont distribution utilities; and  
2. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company  (MMWEC) , where I was responsible 
for the power supply and reg ulatory ma tters of more than 30  Massachusetts municipal 
utilities and represented all Public Power utilities in New England on the NEPOOL 
Operations Committee, which I chaired for two years.  
 
But that was a long time ago.  Since 1989 I have been consulting throughou t the U nited States and 
worldwide in more than 25  countries on issues associated with electricity market design and 
implementation, ancillary services, utility and electricity market operations, inter -utility coordination, 
contractual power supply arrangem ents, and transmission access and pricing.   A short bio is attached to 
this testimony  as Attachment  A. 
 
The purpose of my testimony is three fold:  
 
1. To discuss customer satisfaction with the two Maine Investor -Owned Utilities (IOUs):  Central 
Maine Power Co mpany (CMP) and Versant Power (Versant) , both owned by foreign entities to 
which a significant share of the rates paid by Maine ratepayers go ; 
 
2. To discuss the lack of reliabili ty of the power supply in Maine; and  
 
3. To fully support the legislation (L.D.  1708) to create Pine Tree Power Company.  
 
Customer Satisfaction  
 
In 2020  J.D. Power polled residential customers of utilities throughout the United States  as to their 
satisfaction with their utility service .  The polling included the residential customers of both IOUs and 
Consumer -Owned Utilities (C OUs, consisting of municipals, S tate agencies and cooperatives).  The 
results of this polling show ed the abject failure of Maine’s IOUs to meet  the needs of their customers.  
 
In the case of residential customer s, out of 142  utilities rat ed, Versant ranked  140th and CMP ranked  
142nd.  Yes, that’s right;  Maine had  two of the three worst rated utilities in the whole United States in 
terms of residential customer satisfaction.   Attached as Exhibit  1 is a spreadsheet show ing the ratings  of 
all 142  utilities  and a corresponding bar chart (without all the utility names to save space)  to demonstrate 
their failure visually, especially the extent of the drop off from the 141st to the 142nd rated utility, CMP . 
 
May  19, 2021  William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony

 Additional inform ation can be extracted from this poll data.  In spite of the fact that the customers of 
twice as many IOUs as COUs were polled, n ine of the ten best rat ed utilities were  COUs.  Six teen of the 
best twenty rat ed utilities we re COUs.  Tw enty-two of the thirty  best rat ed utilities we re COUs.  In fact, 
the average rating of the 47  COU s of 768 was significantly better than the average rating of the 95  IOUs 
of 745.  Note that even this average IOU rating of  745 wa s considerably higher than the ratings of 
Maine’s I OUs at 689  for Versant and 634  for CMP.  
 
Conversely, twelve of the thirteen worst rated utilities we re IOUs.  Nineteen of the twenty -one worst rated 
utilities we re IOUs.  Finally, twenty -three of the twenty -six worst rated utilities were IOUs.  The evidenc e 
was clear with respect to residential customer satisfaction, COUs perform ed much better than IOUs, and 
all utilities in the rest of the country perform ed better than Maine’s IOUs.  
 
Note that 2020 was not an unusual year.  In 2019 the J.D.  Power survey of  residential customer  
satisfaction  had the two Maine IO Us as the two lo west rated utilities of the 142  utilities rated.  In 2018 
CMP was slightly better, at 22nd lowest, but Emera was still the 2nd lowest  of the 138  utilities rated that 
year. 
 
J.D. Power a lso surveyed business customers in 2020  as to their satisfaction .  Because of the  J.D. Power  
size criteria  for business customers  (serving more than 40,000  business customer s), quite a few of the 
utilities in the residential customer survey were not includ ed, and Versant  was one of those not included .  
Also, they apparently did not survey the business customers of Cooperatives.  The results, however, we re 
the same.  Out of the 80  utilities surveyed for business customer satisfaction, C MP came in dead last.  
 
CMP’s rating was over 20  points lower than the next lowest rated utility, world famous Pacific Gas & 
Electric (PG&E).  Just imagine how poor your performance must be to be rated well below PG&E : a 
utility that (i) twice filed for bankruptcy; (ii)  is on fe deral probation for a pipeline explosion, (iii)  was 
charged with starting fires that killed 86  people several years ago and (iv) spent the summer of 2020 
implementing rotating blackouts to limit their chance of starting more fires.  
 
With respect to busines s customers, there was not a lot of difference in the average rating of the 70  IOUs 
versus the 10  COUs.   Attached as Exhibit  2 is a spreadsheet showing the rat ings of all 80 utilities  and a 
corresponding bar chart (without all the utility names to save spa ce) to demonstrate their performance 
visually, especially the extent of the drop off from the 79th to the 80th rated utility, CMP.  
 
As with the residential customer survey, 2020 was not an aberration.  In both 2019 and 2018 CMP was 
also the lowest rated ut ility with respect to business customer satisfaction out of 87 and 88 utilities  rated , 
respectively.  
 
One might wonder why the Maine IOUs are so unpopular.  For this, let’s concentrate on CMP, by far the 
larger of the two Maine IOUs.  In the case of CMP it  could be their famous billing problems.  It could be 
the fact that they are using every tactic in the book , including a misleading public relations campaign,  to 
force through their unpopular transmission tie to Québec for the benefit of Massachusetts and CMP ’s 
foreign owners  and to the detriment of Maine’s woods .  It could be their resistance to solar power.  It 
could be their poor customer service , when you can actually reach customer service .  Whatever other 
reason s there are, it could also be the fact t hat Maine has the worse electricity supply reliability in the 
whole nation.  
 
Reliability  
 
The US Energy Informatio n Administration (EIA) publishes  reliability data by S tate and composite data 
for the country every October.  Therefore, the latest data is fo r 2019.  Exhibit  3 shows the data for that 
May  19, 2021  William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony

 year as compiled  by the American Public Power Association (APPA) .  When reviewing this data several 
definitions are helpful:  
 
Acronym  Definition  What it means  
MED  Major Event Days  An interruption or series of int erruptions that exceed reasonable 
design and/or operational limits of the electric power system.   In 
general, this seems to be days with outages longer than 24  hours.  
SAIDI  System Average 
Interruption 
Duration Index  The total sustained interruption durati on for the average customer 
during a predefined period of time.   SAIDI can be viewed as the 
total amount of time the average customer can expect to be out of 
service each year.  
CAIDI  Customer Average 
Interruption 
Duration Index  The average outage duration  that any given customer would 
experience  for each outage .  CAIDI can also be viewed as the 
average restoration time.  
SAIFI  System Average 
Interruption 
Frequency Index  The average number of interruptions that a customer would 
experience each year.  
 
An an alysis of the data in Exhibit  3 is quite instructive.  Looking at the reliability data calculated in 
accordance with the standards of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) , both with 
and without Major Event Days , demonstrates Maine’s  poor performance compared to IOUs in other 
States  and to Public Power utilities : 
2019 Outages Without Major Event Days  
Acronym  Description  U.S. IOUs  Maine IOUs  Public Power  
SAIFI  Number of outages/year  1.18 1.74 0.84 
SAIDI  Total outage minutes/year  149.98 245.90  62.19  
CAIDI  Minutes out/outage (restore time)  122.84  139.22  83.92  
 
As striking as that  table is for demonstrating the failures of Maine’s IOUs, the failure is even more 
apparent when you include Major Event Days:  
2019 Outages With Major Event D ays 
Acronym  Description  U.S. IOUs  Maine IOUs  Public Power  
SAIFI  Number of outages/year  1.50 2.58 1.19 
SAIDI  Total outage minutes/year  298.41  997.00  124.43  
CAIDI  Minutes out/outage (restore time)  186.64  384.17  110.15  
 
As you can see, in 2019 the Maine c ustomers of IOUs experience d more than three  times the minutes of 
outages, including MEDs,  as the customers of IOUs elsewhere in the US  (almost 17  hours of outages) , 
and the average dura tion of each individual outage (more than 6  hours) was more than twice  as long.   As 
can also be seen, public power entities perform ed much better than IOUs in general, with less than half 
the outage minutes each year.  
 
How did Maine compare  to other individual States  in 2019 ?  Again, Maine did  not compare favorably.  
Here  are some of the worst performing States by a variety of measures , with MEDs :

Arkansas  142.00  3.08 46.10  
US Average  298.41  1.50 186.64  
 
Note that I included Arkansas in t his table to show that while they had  the highest nu mber of outages in 
2019, they we re very short outages and acc umulate d to much less time than the States with slow 
restoration times.   The average restoration time for an outage in Maine  was over 6  hours!  
 
Why wa s the reliability of Maine’s IOUs so poor?  I am sure CMP and Versant will say it wa s because 
Maine has su ch bad weather and lots of trees.  How disingenuous.  Lots of States have lots of trees  and 
bad weather , and Maine does  not, for the most part,  have hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.  So, let’s 
compare Maine’s 2019 IOU reliability with other New Eng land States, especially Vermont and New 
Hampshire , with Major Event Days . 
 
 
State  Minutes of  
Outage/Year  Number of  
Outages/Year  Restoration Time

Maine  997.00  2.58 384.17  
Vermont  474.81*  2.02 235.17  
Connecticut  249.20  0.99 251.97  
Rhode Island  236.49 1.40 169.28  
New Hampshire  185.34  1.08 169.07  
Massachusetts  178.63  1.18 156.76  
*  Using the “Other” outage standard as apparently the Vermont IOU doesn’t report by IEEE standards  
 
Again, e ven in New England, Maine stood  out for its poor reliability  in 2019  with more than twice as 
many minutes of outages as the next highest State, Vermont .  And, as with customer satisfaction in 2020, 
Maine’s 2019 reliability was not an aberration.  Here’s a table comparing Maine’s IOU reliability with the 
national ave rages for 2014 to 2018:  
Minutes of Outages With  Major Event Days  
 
Year  U.S. IOUs  Maine IOUs  Public Power  
2018  336.54  706.65  178.09  
2017  366.48  2,295.15  166.55  
2016  282.74  714.20  117.73  
2015  234.91  189.80  124.95  
2014  275.30  1,083.85  79.49  
 
Quite amazi ng isn’t it.  In only one year (2015) did Maine’s IOU’s have reliability comparable to all US 
IOUs, and even in that year it was still worse than the Public Power reliability.  In the other years the 
outage minutes of Main e’s IOUs ranged from 2.1 to 6.3  times the outage minutes of US IOUs and from 
4.0 to 13.8  times the outage minutes of Public Power utilities.  
 
So what is the real reason  for Maine’s poor reliability ?  It is probably a combination of poor design and 
poor maintenance.  The Maine IOUs apparent ly would prefer to put their manpower and capital to 
projects that provide a greater return on investment  to their foreign owners than  invest in reliability  for

 their captive Maine customers .  They are certainly doing that if you check their transmission a nd 
distribution rates over the last 10  years.  Exhibit  4 contains charts showing the rates of CMP and the two 
separate service territories (Divisions) of Versant (the territories of the former Bangor Hydro -Electric 
(BHD) and Maine Public Service (MPD )).  What these charts show is the CMP and Versant are putting 
their investments into transmission rather than distribution, even though it is the distribution system that 
is the source of most outages.  These rate increases are summarized  in the following table : 
 
 2011-2020 Rate Increase  
Utility  Transmission  Distribution  
CMP  100.18%  15.25%  
Versant (BHD ) 60.00%  12.95%  
Versant (MPD ) 176.50%  13.64%  
 
There are real costs, not just inconvenience, to Mainers associated with the poor reliability of Maine’s 
IOUs.  There are the capital costs of all the “backyard” or “standby” generators installed in Maine to 
protect residential, commercial and industrial customers from the repeated failures of the IOU distribution 
systems  which, as previously indicate, are the sourc e of most outages .  There are also the costs of running 
all those backyard or standby generators and the impact on air pollution.   For those business customers 
without backyard generators, or which  have to shut down even though they have on -site power, the re are 
the costs of lost business.  
 
In addition, there are other costs for customers without power, such as the spoilage of food, lost 
production, loss of internet, damage to systems that freeze -up in the cold, etc.  Why do you thi nk we see 
so many ads for  stand by generators on our TVs?   Why do just about all of the houses in my 
neighborhood, including mine, have standby generators?  I grew up in western Massachusetts and lived 
7 years in Vermont and 11  years in the Pioneer Valley (Connecticut River Valley)  of Massachusetts and 
never needed or thought about needing a standby generator.  
 
How would a COU like the proposed Pine Tree Power change the reliability of the Maine transmission 
and distribution system?  Initially, Pine Tree Power would improve reliabil ity by restoring the ability of 
line crews to do their jobs in a safe and efficient manner.  This would include improving the design and 
rebuild of distribution lines that are most likely to need repair, and investing in insulated wires and other 
upgrades,  where appropriate, that should have been implemented in Maine decades ago.  This means a 
short -term investment that will bring long -term benefits.   But, these changes will not happen overnight.  
 
Massachusetts’s 41  COUs provide a good model for investing i n distribution infrastructure in order to 
improve reliability.  Most, if not all, of the COUs in Massachusetts use insulated distribution wires in 
high risk areas, supported by a strong carrying cable.  The added expense is more than justified because it 
protects against outages caused when tree limbs brush against a line causing the circuit to trip.  It also 
means that the line itself can support some branches and trees leaning against it without tripping or 
breaking, allowing the power to remain on until line c rews can clear the branches or fallen tree.  
 
This not only reduces outages, but also facilitates quick repair, which as indicated can simply involve 
removing the branches or trees , without calling in expensive outside help .  Maine’s IOUs, on the othe r 
hand, rely on bringing in contractors, tree trimming companies and crews from out -of-state utilities to 
repair the extensive damage their poor design and maintenance ensures will happen every time there is 
bad weather  or even a little wind .  Many COUs al so use wildlife guards to reduce outages caused by 
squirrels and birds  (CMP just started running an ad saying they are now doing that!) .  Hardening 
distribution lines by using “tree wire” or “spacer cable” systems could add 25% to the cost of materials 
May  19, 2021  William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony

 when installing a line, but would also substantially reduce the cost of foliage removal, repairs and 
maintenance.  
 
Maine IOUs rarely invest in this type of upgraded distribution infrastructure where needed.  The un -
supported, bare distribution wires common throughout our highly forested S tate are vulnerable to the 
impacts of wind, snow, and ice on trees.  The resulting outages are predictable and commonplace.  It has 
become so bad that CMP has been forced to spend time and resources on public relations and inf ormation 
systems to try to soothe public frustration.  Central Maine Power has an expensive and elaborate system 
by which consumers can be informed (often misinformed) of outages.  That this has been necessary is 
revealing.  
 
Power outages also lead to inte rnet outages, since interrupting the power supply to any part of the internet 
infrastructure can cause an internet outage stretching well beyond the area where electric power is out.  
Many customers will lose internet service even when their power supply i s not interrupted.  Customers 
may blame their internet service provider for these outages, when they actually result from a distant 
power outage that can be traced to neglect on the part of the electric utility.  This is especially critical 
when many custo mers are working and attending school from home, a s during the coronavirus 
(COVID -19) pandemic  
 
Power outages are expensive to repair.  Before and after each major storm, large numbers of crews , both 
their own and those of other utilities and service compa nies, are deployed by CMP and Versant at 
significant expense.  Since ratepayers bear most of the cost of these repairs, the IOU has little incentive to 
prevent them by investing in better distribution infrastructure.   In fact, CMP is currently before the M aine 
Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) seeking to be reimbursed $26.5  million for the last failure of their 
dilapidated system  (https://www.pre ssherald.com/2021/04/06/cmp -asks-for-rate-increase -to-offset -costs -
from -5-storms/ ). 
 
Pine Tree Power would not change this overnight.  Weak u ninsulated distribution lines in high risk areas 
built by the IOUs can be replaced over time as their working life  ends or repairs are needed.  Improved 
distribution infrastructure could be used in all new construction rolled out to handle the increase in 
electricity demand to meet Maine’s beneficial electrification policy goals.  Even though these investments 
would r educe service interruptions and facilitate renewable energy, Maine’s IOUs will either not make 
them or will make them at a far higher cost, given their inherent  financial structure.  
 
To the extent that Maine’s IOUs  have recently begun investing in hardenin g of the distribution system, it 
is too little, too late, and too expensive.  Using tax -exempt, low -cost capital, Pine Tree Power can 
accelerate the investments Maine needs to prepare for more extreme weather, while still making it 
imaginable for Maine peo ple and businesses to switch to clean electricity for their heating and 
transportation needs.   This could save Maine over $9  billion over the next 30  years.  
 
While stringing supported insulated distribution wires costs more up front, it saves even more mon ey in 
the long run and significantly reduces the outage rate.  That is one of the ways, along with lower 
financing costs (see a paper I wrote on this , based on the economic studies of LEI and 
Dr. Richard  Silkman , in Attachment  B) and eliminating the consta nt pressure to extract a profit, Pine Tree 
Power can provide improved c ustomer service at lower rates.  
 
The time has come for Maine to relinqui sh its lamentable title as the S tate with the least reliable power  
and the lowest customer satisfaction .  The tim e has come to pass L.D.  1708  and start the process to create 
Pine Tree Power Company to purchase the transmission, distribution and related facilities of CMP and 
Versant and to expand and operate those facilities for the benefit of Maine ratepayers.

ECONOMIC SYNOPSIS  
PINE TREE POWER COMPANY  
Bill Dunn, Yarmouth  
April  2, 2021  
 
On February  15, 2020 London Economics International LLC (“LEI”), in collaboration with Peter Brown, 
Esq., issued a report titled “Evaluation of the Ownership of Maine’s Power D elivery System” (the “LEI 
Report”)1.  This 100  page report, commissioned by the Maine Public Utilities Commission (“MPUC”), 
covered many details associated with the creation of the Maine Power Delivery Authority (“MPDA”).  
While the LEI Report and the Silk man analysis (referenced later) refer to MPDA, I’ll simply refer to Pine 
Tree Power Company (“Pine Tree Power”), which is the current name of the utility that would be created.  
Some recommendations of the LEI Report have been incorporated by the proponent s of Pine Tree Power 
into their newer proposal.  
 
While the LEI Report found Pine Tree Power to be economic in the long run, and positive on a present 
worth basis, their report contained several significant errors which understated the positive economics of  
Pine Tree Power.  Below is Figure  1 from the LEI Report:  
 
                
 
 
                                                 
1  “Evaluation of the Ownership of Maine’s Power Delivery System.” London Economics International, LLC; 
February 15, 2020  
May  19, 2021  William H. Dunn, Jr. Testimony

 The base case in this figure shows the economics if Pine Tree Power purchases the assets of the Investor -
Owned Utilities (“IOUs”)2 at 1.5  times the Net Book Value (“NBV”) of thos e assets (the Reference 
Case).  It indicates that retail rates would be higher under Pine Tree Power for the first 9  years and then 
lower forever after that.  The sensitivity analyses show that Pine Tree Power is less expensive 
immediately for a purchase p rice of 1.3  NBV and is more expensive for the first 19  years for a purchase 
price of 1.7  NBV.  In all cases Pine Tree Power is less expensive (lower electric rates) in the long run 
(30 years).  
 
On a present worth basis, the LEI Report looked at the cumulat ive benefits over both 10  years and 
30 years at discount rates of 3.5% and 5.5%.  The results for the Reference Case (purchase price of 
1.5 NBV) were shown in Figure  3 of the LEI Report:  
 
          
  
 
As can be seen, there are hundreds of millions of dolla rs of long -term savings from Pine Tree Power 
under both discount rates.  In this regard, the LEI Report supports the creation of Pine Tree Power simply 
based on its long -term economic benefits.  Once the errors in the LEI Report are corrected, the economic  
case for Pine Tree Power creation is even stronger.  
 
Dr. Richard Silkman analyzed the LEI Report and its underlying economic Model and published his 
analysis on May  15, 2020.3  The first correction relates to LEI’s treatment of cash.  The LEI Model looks 
at revenues (income) and expenses in determining the economic impact of Pine Tree Power creation.  In 
effect, they determine the Income Statement (or Profit and Loss Statement) for Pine Tree Power over 
time.  However, once Dr.  Silkman examined the underlyi ng Model, he found that besides paying 
expenses and scheduled debt service with the revenues received from customers, the Model was also 
accumulating cash.  This cash was not shown on the Income Statement but on the Balance Sheet as an 
asset, and no credit  was given to the benefits of Pine Tree Power for that cash asset and no interest was 
earned on that asset.  
 
Correcting to recognize the cash and interest earned on the cash, after 30  years Pine Tree Power has 
$1.2 billion less debt and has $5.2  billion in  cash, so Maine ratepayers (the owners of Pine Tree Power) 
are $6.4  billion better off, with a net present worth value of about $2.7  billion.  This value is about 
12 times the $236  million4 present worth value shown in the LEI Report and equal to about $2, 000 for 
                                                 
2 Central Maine Power Compan y (“CMP”) and Versant (until 2020 known as Emera and before that as Bangor -
Hydro).  
3 “Review, Assessment and Restatement of the Financial Model Used by LEI i n its Report to the Maine Legislature 
on the Creation of a Consumer -Owned Public Utility.” Dr. Richard Silkman, May 15, 2020  
4 In his analysis, Dr.  Silkman refers to the LEI calculated long -term present worth savings at a 3.5% discount rate as 
$232  millio n, not $236  million.  The $232  million figure is the figure for that present worth in the LEI Model

 each resident of Maine in 2024.  This accumulation of cash occurs because the LEI Model limits the 
amount of cash that can be used to pay down debt or fund capital expenditures and the cash doesn’t earn 
any interest.  
 
That is not the only issue Dr.  Silkman had with the LEI analysis.  LEI ties operating expenses (“OpEx”) 
to capital expenses (“CapEx”), even though many of the capital expenditures are simply to replace old, 
worn out and fully depreciated equipment.  In other words, excluding system exp ansion, the value of the 
rate base goes up, because newer equipment costs more, but the amount of equipment remains essentially 
the same.  Dr.  Silkman, instead, ties OpEx to the portion of the rate base that is incremental to the 
maintenance rate base as i t exists today.  This lowers the increase in OpEx expenses over the next 
30 years from an ~500% increase to an ~300% increase.  
 
With respect to management expenses, Dr.  Silkman re -creates the CMP (and Versant) management 
structures as they existed before t heir acquisition by other foreign utilities and their need to pay 
management fees to those companies.  This lowers the starting cost of management from ~$82  million in 
the LEI Model to ~$15.3  million (~$11  million for CMP and then scaled up to include Vers ant).  The 
difference in this management fee over 30  years is roughly $4.75  billion.  To put the management fee 
structure LEI has built into its Model in perspective, the average annual management fee over the 30 -year 
period is about $10  million more  than the total amount CMP spent on wages and salaries for its direct 
employees (employees on the CMP payroll and not employees of Avangrid and/or Iberdrola) plus 100% 
of the total affiliate charges to CMP by Avangrid in 2018 under its shared services agreement.  
 
Another significant issue in the LEI study was their use of Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”).  
The way transmission is priced in New England is that all customers share in the cost of the high voltage 
Regional Network Service (“RNS”) transmissio n system.  In effect, Maine customers pay a small 
(approximately 9%) portion of the cost of all RNS transmission elsewhere in New England, and the rest 
of the customers in New England pay a large (approximately 91%) portion of the cost of the RNS 
transmiss ion in Maine.  So, the higher the WACC that Pine Tree Power charges for use of its transmission 
as part of the RNS rate, the higher the contribution to this cost paid by customers elsewhere in New 
England.  Therefore, if Pine Tree Power uses a WACC similar  to the WACCs used by the other 
transmission companies in New England, say 10%, rather than the 8% used in the LEI study, the 
economics of Pine Tree Power improve.  Such adjustment improves Pine Tree Power finances by 
~$4 billion over 30  years.  
 
Finally, there are also differences in the timing of CapEx over the 30  years between Dr.  Silkman and the 
LEI Model, but these do not total to a significant difference and so only represent a very small percent of 
the total differences between the studies.  
 
Of cours e LEI commented on Dr.  Silkman’s analysis,5 but their comments do not change his conclusions:  
 
 With respect to recognizing the excess cash, LEI says that such cash cannot be liquidated without 
impacting future financing costs.  This ignores the simple fact  that the cash is an asset that would 
be part of the value of Pine Tree Power should it be sold, and would earn interest while accruing.  
 With respect to adjusting the OpEx expenses, LEI suggests it is premature to forecast that future 
OpEx would be less, b ut does not respond to the specifics of Dr.  Silkman’s analysis.  They 
suggest that his assumptions could be used with the rest of their assumptions, without 
                                                                                                                                                             
spreadsheet that they provided Dr.  Silkman (Model cell  D189).  Similarly, the spreadsheet shows the present 
worth of the long -term savings at a 5.5%  discoun t rate as $118  million, not the $119  million shown in LEI 
Figure  2.  The reason for these slight discrepancies is not known, but they do not impact the final analysis.

 acknowledging that doing so would improve the economics of Pine Tree Power in their Model 
even more . 
 With respect to management expenses, LEI offers no response.  
 With respect to WACC, LEI says that using 10% would represent departure from precedent in the 
region for municipal rates and would increase the transmission rates for other ratepayers in New 
England.  This ignores Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) decisions that allow a 
COU to impute a capital structure.  Also, since the transmission facilities of CMP and Versant are 
already reflected in the RNS rates, if Pine Tree Power uses the sam e capital structure as CMP and 
Versant in imputing its rate, there would be no change to the rates paid by other New England 
ratepayers.  
 With respect to CapEx, LEI offers no comment on Dr.  Silkman’s view that differences in the 
timing of CapEx would make l ittle difference in the relative economics of the two studies.  
 
When Dr.  Silkman restates the LEI Model making the corrections noted above the results are quite 
spectacular.  For the Reference Case (purchase price of 1.5  NBV), without recognizing the 
accum ulation of cash:  
           
 
 
As can be seen, instead of being more expensive for the first 9  years, under the restated Model Pine Tree 
Power saves Maine ratepayers money through lower rates starting in the first year of operation.  In the 
later years the  rate savings to Maine ratepayers are well over $100  million/year.  
 
Once the accumulation of cash is also taken into account, the total benefits to ratepayers in both the 
lowering of electric rates and the accumulation of cash to either invest in the syste m or pay down debt are 
even greater:

Of course, these savings would continue to accrue in future years and at an even high rate as the higher 
interest rate taxable debt used to acquire the assets of the IOUs in 2024 would be retired shortly af ter the 
30 year study window.
