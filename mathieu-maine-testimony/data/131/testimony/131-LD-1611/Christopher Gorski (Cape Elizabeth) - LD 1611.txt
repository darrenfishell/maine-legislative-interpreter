To the Honorable Members of the Maine Legislature,
I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed legislation that would 
force the sale of Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Energy, the two 
predominant for-profit energy providers in our state, to a non-profit entity owned by 
consumers. As a resident of Maine for over four years, I have experienced firsthand 
the negative impacts of these companies' practices on our community, and I believe 
that a consumer-owned utility would better serve the interests of Maine residents.
During my time in Maine, my power has gone out on more than ten occasions. This 
frequency of outages is unacceptable and demonstrates a lack of investment in 
infrastructure and maintenance by CMP and Versant. Furthermore, I have witnessed 
CMP's refusal to perform basic maintenance on our street, such as removing heavy 
branches from power lines, unless there is an immediate problem with service. This 
reactive approach to maintenance, rather than a proactive one, has led to additional 
outages and safety concerns for our community.
One specific example of CMP's negligence occurred when our street experienced two 
power outages due to plants growing onto transformers. Had CMP simply performed 
proper maintenance while repairing the first outage, which would have involved 
minimal trimming of plants, the second outage would not have occurred. This lack of 
attention to basic maintenance is indicative of a company that prioritizes profits over 
the well-being of its customers.
In another instance, I called CMP about a downed line from a utility pole on my 
street. Their response was that unless the line was obviously a power line and posed a 
danger, they would not come out to inspect it, and I should contact local government 
instead. This callous attitude towards customer concerns and public safety is deeply 
troubling and further demonstrates the need for a utility that is accountable to the 
people it serves.
Moreover, CMP's actions regarding the controversial CMP corridor project have 
shown a blatant disregard for the will of the public. The company has actively fought 
against efforts to stop the project, despite widespread opposition from Maine 
residents. Additionally, CMP has engaged in propaganda campaigns that spread 
misinformation about the project, further eroding trust in the company.
In light of these experiences, I firmly believe that the state of Maine should force the 
sale of CMP and Versant Energy to a non-profit, consumer-owned entity. Such a 
utility would prioritize the needs of Maine residents over profits, leading to improved 
service, better maintenance, and a more responsive approach to customer concerns. I 
urge you to support this legislation and work towards a brighter, more reliable energy 
future for our state.
