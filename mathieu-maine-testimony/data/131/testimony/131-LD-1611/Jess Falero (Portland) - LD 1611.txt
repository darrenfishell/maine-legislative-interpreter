Senator

and

the

and

my
name
is
Jess
Falero.
I
am
a
resident
of
Portland
and
Climate
Justice
Coordinator
for
Maine
Climate
Action
Now ,
a
statewide
coalition
of
grassroots
or ganizations
who
support
transformative
action
in
response
to
the
climate
crisis.
W e
hold
social,
racial,
and
economic
justice
as
critical
to
the
transition
to
zero
carbon
emissions
by
2030
and
demand
the
equitable
implementation
of
clean
renewable
ener gy
and
bold
community-led
action
for
a
more
resilient
Maine.
As
a
young
person
who
is
transitioning
from
being
unhoused
to
having
housing,
and
as
a
young
person
entering
into
the
workforce
I
know
first
hand
how
dif ficult
it
is
to
make
enough
money
to
rent
an
apartment
in
the
state
of
Maine.
Coupling
this
with
the
rising
costs
of
utilities,
food,
and
childcare
we
are
playing
a
dangerous
game
with
the
tables
tipping
towards
the
poor .
CMP
rates
are
continuing
to
increase;
with
the
company
submitting
a
rate
increase
to
the
PUC
this
year .
One
company
that
is
in
char ge
of
our
electric
grid
in
Maine,
Central
Maine
Power ,
is
owned
by
the
governments
of
Spain,
Norway ,
and
Qatar .
V ersant
is
owned
100%
by
Calgary
Canada.
W ith
Pine
T ree
Power
we
are
bringing
decisions
about
our
grid
back
to
the
people
who
use
it,
Mainers.
No
other
essential
service
is
owned
by
a
foreign
company:
our
electricity
should
not
be
either .
Maine
currently
has
9
consumer -owned
utility
companies
that
serve
97
municipalities.
Residents
in
these
towns
own
their
own
electric
company ,
which
is
accountable
to
its
customers/owners.
Their
rates
are
lower ,
and
their
voices
are
heard.
W e
must
invest
in
the
grid
to
achieve
clean
ener gy .
All
six
US
communities
to
have
reached
100%
renewables
already
are
powered
by
consumer -owned
utilities.
The
leading
lar ge
utility
in
the
race
to
100%
renewable
ener gy
is
also
a
COU.
Sacramento’ s
COU
expects
to
be
there
by
2030,
decades
before
Maine.
As
of
right
now ,
for
the
richest
country
in
the
world
we
have
a
poverty
death
rate
of
700
people
per
day .
In
my
personal
life
I’ve
raised
thousands
of
dollars
and
put
it
in
the
pockets
of
young
people
in
our
community
who
cannot
af ford
to
meet
their
basic
needs;
often
including
high

utility
bills.
For
three
years
I
have
raised
amounts
ranging
from
$10-$100
through
my
social
media
accounts
in
order
to
meet
these
basic
needs
for
myself
and
others.
I
could
go
on
to
tell
you
about
my
experience
of
paying
92%
of
my
income
on
rent
and
scavenging
to
pay
utilities.
I
could
tell
you
my
experience
of
renting
a
room
in
a
house
in
Portland
with
five
people.
Even
with
our
combined
incomes,
we
could
not
cover
our
CMP
bill.
I
could
go
on
to
tell
you
the
nights
I’ve
spent
shivering
in
bed
with
a
winter
coat
on.
I
won’ t
go
into
those
details
for
my
own
well
being
and
the
well
being
of
those
listening
but
what
I
will
say
is
this:
Consumer
owned
utilities
is
a
first
step
in
economic
justice
and
climate
justice.
And
nobody
should
be
profiting
of f
of
a
state
of
people
trying
to
survive.
This
is
why
MCAN
is
asking
State
Legislators
to
put
this
before
the
voters
and
let
the
people
decide.

Testimony in Support of L.D. 1611: An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, 
a Nonprofit, Customer-owned Utility
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Committee on Energy,
Utilities and Technology, my name is Jess Falero. I am a resident of Portland and 
Climate Justice Coordinator for Maine Climate Action Now, a statewide coalition of 
grassroots organizations who support transformative action in response to the climate 
crisis. We hold social, racial, and economic justice as critical to the transition to zero 
carbon emissions by 2030 and demand the equitable implementation of clean 
renewable energy and bold community-led action for a more resilient Maine. 
As a young person who is transitioning from being unhoused to having housing, and 
as a young person entering into the workforce I know first hand how difficult it is to 
make enough money to rent an apartment in the state of Maine. Coupling this with the
rising costs of utilities, food, and childcare we are playing a dangerous game with the 
tables tipping towards the poor. CMP rates are continuing to increase; with the 
company submitting a rate increase to the PUC this year. 
One company that is in charge of our electric grid in Maine, Central Maine Power, is 
owned by the governments of Spain, Norway, and Qatar. Versant is owned 100% by 
Calgary Canada. With Pine Tree Power we are bringing decisions about our grid back
to the people who use it, Mainers. No other essential service is owned by a foreign 
company: our electricity should not be either. Maine currently has 9 consumer-owned 
utility companies that serve 97 municipalities. Residents in these towns own their own
electric company, which is accountable to its customers/owners. Their rates are lower,
and their voices are heard. 
We must invest in the grid to achieve clean energy. All six US communities to have 
reached 100% renewables already are powered by consumer-owned utilities. The 
leading large utility in the race to 100% renewable energy is also a COU. 
Sacramento’s COU expects to be there by 2030, decades before Maine. 
As of right now, for the richest country in the world we have a poverty death rate of 
700 people per day. In my personal life I’ve raised thousands of dollars and put it in 
the pockets of young people in our community who cannot afford to meet their basic 
needs; often including high utility bills. For three years I have raised amounts ranging 
from $10-$100 through my social media accounts in order to meet these basic needs 
for myself and others. 
I could go on to tell you about my experience of paying 92% of my income on rent 
and scavenging to pay utilities. I could tell you my experience of renting a room in a 
house in Portland with five people. Even with our combined incomes, we could not 
cover our CMP bill. I could go on to tell you the nights I’ve spent shivering in bed 
with a winter coat on. I won’t go into those details for my own well being and the 
well being of those listening but what I will say is this: 
Consumer owned utilities is a first step in economic justice and climate justice. And 
nobody should be profiting off of a state of people trying to survive. This is why 
MCAN is asking State Legislators to put this before the voters and let the people 
decide.
