Testimony of James LaBrecque 
Neither For Nor Against LD1611, An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a 
Nonprofit, Customer-owned Utility 
May 4, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee. l want the committee to include an amendment to assure consumers energy security. If Pine 
Tree Power should fail, the state would face serious jeopardy with every home and business in the state if 
they controlled both Versant and CMP. 
To minimize such a catastrophic event, the amendment would include a sequencing of the takeover, ﬁrst 
Pine Tree Power would take control of Versant for 3 years and if successful than they could follow 
through by taking over CMP assets, if they fail and put Versant in ﬁnancial jeopardy than the damage to 
the state is more manageable whereas the larger utility company would not be part of the failure. 
The people of this state deserve to have such safeguards in place to protect our future from catastrophic 
harm.
