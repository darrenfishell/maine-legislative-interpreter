Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1611:
“An
Act
to
Create
the
Pine
Tree
Power
Company,
a
Nonprofit,
Customer-owned
Utility”
Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technology,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
nonprofit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1611
.
First,
we’d
like
to
thank
the
committee
for
holding
a
public
hearing
on
LD
1611,
which
adheres
to
LD
1209
from
the
129th
Maine
Legislature,
despite
the
governor’s
contention
that
the
Legislature
lost
its
opportunity
to
weigh
in
on
this
measure
because
of
its
previous
sine
die
adjournment.
Maine
Policy
worked
hard
on
LD
1209
because
we
believe
the
public
interest
is
better
served
when
hearings
are
held
on
initiated
bills
before
they
go
to
the
ballot,
regardless
of
the
Legislature’s
ultimate
action.
The
substance
of
these
hearings
and
the
information
discussed
is
far
greater
and
more
enlightening
for
voters
than
the
30-second
sound
bites
they
will
hear
leading
up
to
Election
Day.
This
hearing
today
is
why
we
pushed
for
passage
of
LD
1209
and
why
Gov.
Mills
signed
it
into
law.

Mainers
should
have
the
benefit
of
being
able
to
submit
testimony,
and
hearing
legislative
deliberation
by
way
of
a
public
hearing
before
being
asked
to
vote
on
a
complex
policy
proposal
amid
everything
else
on
their
November
ballot.
The
public
has
a
right
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
government;
political
campaigns
are
far
from
an
ideal
arena
to
flesh
out
a
policy
as
complex
and
unpredictable
as
the
proposed
Pine
Tree
Power
Company
(PTPC).
This
idea
has
been
debated
several
times
over
the
last
four
years,
both
in
the
State
House
and
in
the
public
square,
in
similar
forms.
Cut
to
the
core
of
the
issue:
how
could
it
possibly
lower
rates
for
Mainers?
Why
should
we
believe
that
politicians
can
run
a
power
company
better
than
people
who
actually
know
the
technical
aspects
of
the
business?
The
sponsors’
attempts
to
explain
the
differences
between
an
“investor-owned”
utility
(IOU)
like
Central
Maine
Power
(CMP)
and
a
“consumer-owned”
utility
(COU)
like
the
proposed
PTPC
fail
to
recognize
the
economic
realities
of
incentives.
Simply:
IOUs
may
balance
risks
and
costs
between
their
shareholders
and
ratepayers,
while

COUs
only
have
ratepayers
on
whom
to
balance
their
books.
As
testimony
from
Worthington
Sawtelle,
LLC
mentioned
last
session,
the
sponsors
have
grossly
overstated
the
benefits
of
their
model
in
terms
of
cost-savings,
reliability,
and
capacity
for
decarbonization.
2
During
the
first
attempt
by
sponsors
to
push
an
idea
very
similar
to
this
one
in
the
129th
Legislature,
Boston-based
London
Economics
International,
LLC
(LEI)
published
a
report
with
drastic
implications.
3
As
LEI’s
“sensitivity
analysis”
notes,
the
overall
costs
and
the
estimated
time
needed
to
recoup
the
initial
purchase
may
vary
dramatically,
even
with
minor
changes
to
the
many
variables:
the
growth
rate
in
Maine's
energy
consumer
base
(population),
the
acquisition
price
of
the
IOUs’
property
("net
book
value"),
the
rate
of
interest
paid
on
debt
related
to
acquisition
of
utility
property
by
the
COU,
and
the
rate
of
profit
from
the
COU’s
managed
assets.
4
Back
then,
LEI
estimated
the
"net
book
value,"
or
initial
price
of
acquisition,
to
be
around
$4
billion,
but
more
recent
estimates
pin
the
value
of
T&D
assets
in
the
state
at
more
than
$13
billion.
Factoring
in
the
many
other
variables,
including
unknown
costs
from
a
guaranteed
court
fight
to
ensue
following
potential
passage
in
November,
LEI
estimated
that
it
could
take
up
to
20
years
for
the
public-owned
utility
to
recoup
the
initial
cost.
This
project
could
take
literally
decades
to
become
a
“better
deal,”
as
proponents
claim,
for
the
consumers
who
supposedly
own
the
project,
if
ever.
The
current
situation
is
dire.
Ratepayers
are
still
reeling
from
record
rate
increases
year-over-year
since
2021.
Misguided
politicians
running
the
states
within
our
regional
electric
grid,
ISO-NE,
are
rejecting
reliable
base-load
power
sources
like
nuclear
and
hydroelectric
power
in
favor
of
intermittent,
unreliable
sources
like
wind
and
solar.
If
that
wasn’t
enough,
our
state
Public
Advocate
is
warning
that
well-intentioned
programs
like
community
solar
will
make
the
situation
for
ratepayers
even
worse.
5
The
Mills
administration
is
openly
acknowledging
that
it
is
blocking
the
entrance
of
cheaper
power
for
Mainers
in
favor
of
protecting
their
friends
in
the
biomass
industry.
6
Our
energy
policy
is
seriously
off-track.
There
is
nothing
in
Maine
law
which
would
prohibit
a
truly
independent
nonprofit
corporation
from
raising,
investing,
and
leveraging
funds
to
negotiate
with
Central
Maine
Power
and
Versant
to
purchase
transmission
lines,
but
it
should
not
need

state-backed
eminent
domain
power
to
force
its
way
into
the
market.
Furthermore,
entrusting
a
quasi-public
entity
run
by
politicians,
who
are
under
no
obligation
to
understand
the
economics
or
science
of
reliable
energy
transmission,
presents
a
danger
to
ratepayers
and
public
trust.
If
Mainers
are
dissatisfied
with
their
power
company
today,
LD
1611
is
a
surefire
way
to
make
it
worse.
Please
vote
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
on
LD
1611
to
signal
to
voters
that
this
is
a
wasteful
and
economically
destructive
move.
Given
the
harmful
nature
of
this
proposal,
there
is
no
tinkering
on
the
margins
that
can
be
done
by
way
of
a
competing
measure
that
would
make
it
palatable.
Allow
voters
to
defeat
it
later
this
year.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
