Please bring this bill to the voters. I am a summer resident of Swan's Island. Versant 
has recently charged me $2075.94 for two months of electricity they say was used by 
an unoccupied summer house with the power turned off. There is no sump pump or 
heat in the house, nor was there a break-in at the house. It is physically impossible for 
this amount of electricity to have been used (approximately 30 times the amount 
normally used when the house is occupied). Despite this, Versant has refused to work 
with me to find out the problem. Maine residents, full-time and summer, deserve 
better. Please allow voters to vote on an alternative.
