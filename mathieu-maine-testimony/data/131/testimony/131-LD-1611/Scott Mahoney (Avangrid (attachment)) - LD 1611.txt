Central Maine Power Company 
Testimony in Opposition to LD 1708  
An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company 
 
May 20, 2021 
 
Chairman Lawrence, Chairman Berry, and memb ers of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee:  
My name is Joshua Dunlap and I live in Scarboro ugh, having been born and raised in central 
Maine.  I am an attorney at Pierce Atwood LL P and I am before you today representing Central 
Maine Power Company (“CMP”) in opposition to LD 1708, “An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit Utility, To Deliver Lower Rates, Reliability and Local Control for 
Maine Energy Independence.”  These written co mments do not address the likelihood that the 
legislation will deliver on the promises set out in  its title, but instead focus on some of the 
constitutional and other legal infirmit ies of the proposed legislation.   
 
Most significantly, as explained below, the bill creates substantial potential liability for the State 
of Maine.  Because the legislation is unconstitutional, it will generate lengthy and complex litigation in which the State could end up, at a mi nimum, paying the attorneys’ fees incurred by 
the utility companies in striking down the law.  Even if the law were not struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional, the State would still be at substantial risk.  Because the bill does 
not provide for paying just compensation to the ow ner of the seized utilities for the value of the 
utility as a going concern, the people of Main e would have to pay fo r the attorneys’ fees 
incurred by the utilities in pursuing the proper measure of compensation and would also have to foot the bill for paying the difference between the amount of compensation contemplated in 
the bill and the utilities’ value as a going enterpri se.  The bill also create s other legal issues.  
 I. LD 1708 violates the Takings Clauses of the U.S. and Maine Constitutions.   
 
Because LD 1708 contemplates involuntary seizure of private property, the bill triggers the 
protections of the Takings Clauses of the U.S. and Maine Constitutions.  The Fifth Amendment 
of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the taking of private property without just compensation.  See 
U.S. Const. amend. V.  The Main e Constitution similarly provides that “[p]rivate property shall 
not be taken for public uses without just compen sation; nor unless the public exigencies require 
it.”  Me. Const. art. I, § 21.     
 
A. LD 1708 does not meet the exigency test. 
 
For any taking to lawfully occur, there must be both a public purpose and public exigency.  
Blanchard v. Dep’t of Transp ., 2002 ME 96, ¶ 27, 798 A.2d 1119; see Bayberry Cove Children’s 
Land Trust v. Town of Steuben , 2018 ME 28, ¶ 8,  180 A.3d 119; Brown v. Warchalowski , 471 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  2 
 
A.2d 1026, 1029.  Absent public purpose and exigency, then the law must be struck down and 
the State cannot take the property at all.  If there is a public purpose and exigency, then the property can be taken, but the affected proper ty owner must be provided just compensation 
for the taking.  
 
As an initial matter, LD 1708 is flawed because it  contains no legislative finding of exigency.  See 
Brown , 471 A.2d. at 1035 (Me. 1984) (W athen, C.J., concurring) (noting a law is unconstitutional 
“without a finding of any public necessity or convenience”).  In any event, there is no apparent basis for a finding of public exigency.  Any such finding would need to satisfy the following three-part test: (1) the taking was necessary; (2) the property 
interest was taken only to the extent necessa ry; and (3) the property is suitable for the 
particular public use for which it was taken.  Bayberry , 2018 ME 28, ¶ 9; see Blanchard , 2002 
ME 96, ¶ 43 (Saufley, C.J., dissenting) (noting that any finding of public exigency must be 
rational, and citing Ace Ambulance Serv., Inc.  v. City of Augusta , 337 A.2d 661, 663 (Me. 1975)).  
 There is no public need for the ta king.  The goal of the bill (to th e extent it can be ascertained 
with no finding of public exigency) appears to  be obtaining greater reliability and/or lower 
rates.  Others have explained how this cannot occur, and further, how regulatory oversight 
could be weakened through public ownership.  Indeed, it appears that the bill would require ratepayers to pay the complete cost of service,  including debt service, no matter how high the 
interest rate, and with no regulatory constrai nt for the rates to be just and reasonable.  
 In the absence of any benefit to the public, the go al of transferring ownership alone reflects no 
public exigency.  See Carey v. Bliss , 151 Mass. 364, 379-80,  25 N.E. 92 (1890); The Boston Water 
Power Co. v. The Boston and Worcester Rail Road Corp. , 40 Mass. 360, 393 (1839).
1  Transfer of 
ownership, however, is all that LD 1708 woul d accomplish.  LD 1708 provides that the new 
public municipal corporation shall contract with  a nongovernmental entity to operate the new 
utility, and all its employees shall be deemed priv ate.  Further, the bill provides that the bonds 
to fund the seizure are not to be backed by the St ate.  Thus the practical change effected by the 
legislation is simply that operation will be sh ifted from one private entity to another.  
 
Something more is required.  Under Maine law, a finding of inadequacy of  service is necessary 
to show public need.  See 35 M.R.S. §§ 2102, 2105; Standish Telephone Co. v. P.U.C. , 499 A.2d 
458, 462 (Me. 1985).  At a minimum, some rati onal finding and explanation as to how the 
ownership transfer alone would address a need a nd benefit the people of Maine is required.  
 Even if there were a public need for the taking, the bill is not adequately targeted – as required 
by the second part of the exigency test.  The br oad applicability of the law, and its lack of 
precision as to what property is being taken, demonstrates that the utilities property was not 
“taken only to the extent necessary.”  LD 17 08 provides that, within a specified period, the 
public municipal corporation shall purchase or ac quire by eminent domain all “utility facilities” 
                                                           
1  Massachusetts has a similar exigency requirement.  See Mass. Const. part I, Art. X. 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  3 
 
in the State owned or operated or held for future use by any investor-owned T&D utility, and 
may also purchase or acquire by eminent do main any other investor-owned T&D “utility 
property” should the public municipal corporatio n determine such an acquisition to be in the 
interest of its customer-owners.  Setting aside the problem with the measure of compensation 
and other issues raised by this approach ( see infra ), it is unclear how there can be an exigency 
to take some but not all utility assets, and only  those not owned by consumer-owned utilities.  
 Finally, the chapter 65 procedure referenced fo r the condemnation of utility facilities and 
property does not provide for review of the propriety of the taking.  See 35-A M.R.S. § 6505(2).  
An entity whose property is being taken must ha ve an opportunity to challenge the taking on 
the basis that constitutional public use and exigency requirements have not been met.  
 
B. LD 1708 does not meet the requi rement for just compensation. 
 Even if the taking satisfied the public exigency test, the measure provided in the bill for compensating the owners of the seized assets does not meet constitutional requirements.  
 Under the Taking Clause, a condemning statute mu st designate the procedural means to obtain 
the necessary just compensation.  See Jordan v. Town of Canton, 265 A.2d 96, 100 (Me. 1970). 
LD 1708  sets a method for determining compensation  that is constituti onally deficient.  
 For the measure of compensation to be “just” under the Constitution, the property owner must be provided the “exact equivalent” of the mone tary worth of the value of the property taken .  
Orono-Veazie Water District v. Penobscot County Water Co. , 348 A.2d 249 (Me. 1975) (striking 
down act condemning utility property for failu re to provide equivalent money worth); see 
Rangeley Water Co. v. Rangeley Water Dist. , 1997 ME 32, ¶ 18, 691 A.2d 171. 
 The touchstone for just compensation is fair market value.  See Curtis v. Maine State Highway 
Commission, 160 Me. 262, 266, 203 A. 2d 451, 453 (1966).  The test of fair market value is “the 
value of the [property] for its best and highest use at the time of the taking or in the foreseeable future.”  Id.  The owner whose property is subjec t to a taking is “to be made whole 
insofar as money can compensate.”  Id.
2   
 
The distinction in LD 1708  between “facilities” and “property” – requiring purchase of utility 
“facilities” but merely permitting the purchas e of utility “property” – runs afoul of the 
requirement to provide just compensation becaus e it is a transparent effort to avoid paying 
compensation for the value of the seized utility as a whole.  The property taken by LD 1708  
includes the utilities’ right to operate as a going concern.  See Morris County Transfer Station, 
Inc. v. Frank’s Sanitation Service, Inc. , 617 A.2d 291, 293 (N. J. Super.  Ct. App. Div. 1992) (“It is 
settled that a franchise granted by the State in return for the performance of a public service, 
                                                           
2 Three valuation methodologies commonly used alone or in combination are similar sales analysis, 
income or capitalization, and repr oduction cost less compliance.  See Rangeley Water Co. , 1997 ME 32, 
¶ 9, 691 A.2d 171. 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  4 
 
such as a public utility franchise, constitutes a property right.” (citing Frost v. Corporation 
Comm. of Oklahoma , 278 U.S. 515 (1929)); New York Elec. Lines Co. v. Empire City Subway Co. , 
235 U.S. 179, 193 (1914); Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States , 148 U.S. 312, 328-29 (1893).)  
As such, the proper measure of a taking include s more than just physical assets and property 
rights; it includes the value of the going concern as well.  In Brunswick & T. Water Dist. v. Maine 
Water Co., 99 Me. 371, 59 A. 537 (1904), the Law Court wrote: 
 
Now, what is the property which the district has taken by the power of eminent 
domain? In the first place, it is a structure, pure and simple, consisting of pipes, 
pumps, engines, reservoirs, machinery, a nd so forth, with land rights and water 
rights. . . . But, more than this, it is a structure in actual use; a use remunerative 
to some extent. It has customers. It is ac tually engaged in business. It is a going 
concern. The value of the structure is enhanced by the fact that it is being used 
in, and in fact is essential to, a going concern business. 
 
Id. at 539.  The State therefore cannot simply cherry pick from the utilities’ assets, without 
compensating for the loss of value of the property  from which those assets  have been severed.  
The Law Court has left no ambiguity on this point.  In East Boothbay Water Dist. v. Inhabitants 
of the Town of Boothbay Harbor, 158 Me. 32, 177 A.2d 659 (1962), the Law Court considered a 
law authorizing a water district to purchase the utility properties and franchises owned by the 
Town of Boothbay Harbor.  As the Law Court stated: 
 The language of section 10 as painstakingly corelated [ sic] with that of section 9 
preponderates very appreciably to the conclusion that in section 10 the 
Legislature purposed to designate 'the entire plant, properties, rights,' etc. of the 
defendant rather than to denote 'all or part  of the entire plant,' etc.  Such is the 
abiding and persistent impression engende red.  And were that objective reality 
not so, the contrary would be regrettable and grievous.  An election accorded to 
the plaintiff to condemn selectively a po rtion of the defendants' franchises or 
assets in plaintiff's domain and to prescind at will from the remainder of such properties could be obviously productive of  resultants very partial to the plaintiff 
and sacrificial or even crippling for the defendant whose license to function in 
plaintiff's territory has not been repealed. 
 
Id., 158 Me. at 40, 1 77 A.2d at 664; see id. , 158 Me. at 41, 177 A.2d at  664 (“If the plaintiff 
elects to condemn it must appropriate and pay th e fair and equitable worth of all the franchises 
and assets of defendant in plaintiff's territo ry with the single exception of defendant's 
corporate franchise.”).  See also CMP v. Town of Moscow , 649 A.2d 320 (Me. 1994) (noting 
propriety of municipal assessors’ valuation of a hydroelectric project based on a combination of 
project’s replacement value and value as a “going concern”); Merrill Trust Co. v. State, 417 A.2d 
435, 440 (Me. 1980) (just compensation includes not only the value of the part taken but the 
damages accruing to the residue, i.e., severance damages).   
 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  5 
 
In sum, the State cannot avoid paying for the enti re value of the T&D utilities by attempting to 
distinguish between “facilities” and “prope rty,” and must pay just compensation, i.e. fair 
market value, for the whole.   
II. LD 1708 violates the Due Process, Commerce, a nd Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. and 
Maine Constitutions. 
 
L.D. 1708  suffers from a host of additional consti tutional flaws.  It implicates numerous 
provisions of the U.S. and Maine Constitution s, including the Due Process Clause, the Equal 
Protection Clause, and the Commerce Clause.  These are addressed in brief below.  Due Process Clause.  L.D. 1708  runs afoul of the Due Process Clause.  A law that is too vague 
violates principles of Due Process under bo th the U.S. and Maine Constitutions.  See Cobb v. Bd. 
of Counseling Prof’ls Licensure , 2006 ME 48, ¶ 57, 896 A.2d 271,  286.  The bill contains 
inconsistencies that render it suspect under this  void-for-vagueness rule.  For example, the bill 
provides both that the Superior Court shall rend er a decision as to the purchase price for T&D 
utilities’ facilities and properties, while also pr oviding that the public municipal corporation’s 
eminent domain powers shall be exercised in the same manner and under the same conditions as set forth under chapter 65 of Title 35-A.  A ch apter 65 procedure involves proceedings before 
county commissioners relating to the assets within  the borders of that county.  Does this bill 
truly contemplate dozens of county-wide proceedi ngs?  And, if so, how are those proceedings 
to work given that they contemplate damage s being set by county commissioners, not the 
Superior Court?  And how could appeal from a chapter 65 proceeding be taken if the only issue 
that can be appealed is the amount of damages – an issue that the county commissioners may or may not be able to address? The powers  bestowed upon the newly-created municipal 
corporation, unconstrained by regulatory ov ersight by the Public Utilities Commission and 
infected with vague procedures, violate due process principles.  
 
LD 1708 also creates due process issues aside from  the takings process itse lf.  In its “fitness to 
serve” provision, the bill states that a T&D utility with 50,000 or more customers must be deemed unfit to serve and must be sold if the PUC finds that two of three criteria have been met.  These criteria relate to customer satisf action, reliability, and cost.  These criteria are 
suspect as unduly vague.  It is entirely unclear what it means to have “repeatedly” reported 
reliability that is in the lowest decile of utilities of a similar size, or to have “repeatedly” charged 
rates in the highest decile among utilities of a sim ilar size.  The “fitness to serve” provision also 
suffers from other due process flaws, in that it purports to establish as a criterion for 
determining fitness whether or not a utility has been  “repeatedly . . . rated in the lowest decile 
of utilities of a similar size for customer satisfaction on a reputable national survey of utility business or retail customers.”  In addition to be ing void for vagueness, this provision violates 
the nondelegation doctrine.  The Maine Constitu tion specifically distributes the powers of 
government to the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.  See Me. Const. art. III, §§ 1, 2.  
The “fitness to serve” provision would give to  unspecified private survey organizations the 
power to determine a utility’s fitness to serve.  It  is unlawful to delegate such powers to private 
organizations.  See Corning Glass Works v. A nn & Hope, Inc. of Danvers , 363 Mass. 409, 423 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  6 
 
(1973) (unlawful to permit manufacturer or dist ributor of a product to fix a minimum retail 
price, because that would allow policy deci sions to be made by private entities). 
 
Further, as a practical matter, at least as to CM P, not all the assets needed for its T&D delivery 
system to function properly are located within the State of Maine.  But the State has no 
jurisdiction over and cannot condemn assets outsid e its borders.  An attempt to seize property 
outside the borders of the State violates bo th the Due Process and Commerce Clauses.  See 
BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore , 517 U.S. 559, 571-72 (1996) (sta tes may not impose sanctions on 
economic actors with the intent of  changing conduct in other states);  Hartford Accident & 
Indem. Co. v. Delta & Pine Land Co ., 292 U.S. 143, 149 (1943) ( under Due Process Clause, state 
may not extend the effect of its laws beyond its borders to as to destroy or impair rights 
elsewhere); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge , 246 U.S. 357, 376- 77 (1918).   
 
Commerce Clause.  LD 1708  also gives rise to other Commerc e Clause issues.  Placing an 
excessive burden on interstate co mmerce without adequate justification is unconstitutional.  
See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. , 297 U.S. 137, 145 (1970).  The Commerce Clause thus prevents 
states from burdening interstate commerce throug h the exercise of the takings power.  Given 
the interrelated nature of the interstate powe r delivery system, the condemnation proposed in 
the bill runs afoul of the Commerce Clause.  See Burlington N. v. Fort Bend County , 2009 WL 
1172704, at * 2-3 (S.D. Tex. Apr.  29, 2009) (railroad adequately a lleged that the town’s exercise 
of eminent domain impermissibly burdened interstate commerce);  City of Oakland v. Oakland 
Raiders , 220 Cal. Rptr. 153, 158 (Ct.  App. 1985) (striking down a municipal condemnation under 
the Commerce Clause because it would in terfere with the “national economy”). 
 Equal Protection Clause.  L.D. 1708  violates equal protection principles.  The bill discriminates 
between privately owned and “consumer-owned”  T&D utilities based on no articulated or 
apparent rational basis.  Such discrimi nation is suspect under Maine law.  In Dickinson v. Maine 
Pub. Serv. Co. , 233 A.2d 435 (Me. 1966), the Law Court co nsidered the constitutionality of 1965 
amendments to the Public Utility Code that purpo rted to vest cooperatives with an exclusive 
franchise territory and other rights traditionally  reserved to public utilities, but at the same 
time did not subject the cooperatives to regulati on and control over their rates and borrowings.  
The Law Court held that this violated the Equal Protection Clause: 
 [W]hen the effect of legislation [is] to confer upon the cooperative territorial immunity without at the same time im posing upon it the same requirements 
with respect to non-discriminatory public  service, regulation and control as are 
imposed upon all competing public utilities offering the identical service, the competitors were thereby deprived of equal protection of the laws. 
 Dickinson , 223 A.2d at 440.  Likewise, LD 1708  deprives private T&D utilities of equal protection 
of the laws by targeting them for purpo ses of the exercise of eminent domain.  
 
Contracts Clause.   L.D. 1708  destroys public utilities’ franchise right to serve exclusively absent 
a necessity finding under 35-A M.R.S. § 2102 by se izing T&D utility assets. Third-party contracts 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  7 
 
would also be impaired by such seizures. As su ch, the Contract Clause of the U.S. and Maine 
Constitutions are implicated.  U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10; Me. Const., Art. I, § 11.  
 The federal courts apply a three-part test for violation of the Clause: 
 
First, the court will assess the degree of substantiality of the impairment of the contract. Second, if a substantial impairme nt has occurred, the court will inquire 
whether there is a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the legislation. Third, if such a purpose has been identified, the court will then determine whether or not the particular impairment is appropriate to the accomplishment of public purpose, in whic h regard the court will generally defer 
to the legislative judgment. 
 
Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co.,  459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983). 
 Seizing the assets needed to provide service obviously substantially impairs the utilities’ 
contracts.  The remaining two parts of the test raise the same issues as discussed with respect 
to the Takings Clause in terms of a rational legislative finding of necessity. 
 
The Law Court, however, has applied a stricter test under Maine’s counterpart to the Contract Clause:  any legislation that lessens the value of a contract to the parties, or lessens the efficacy 
of the means by which a party can enforce the contract, impairs the obligation and is therefore unconstitutional.  Portland Savings Bank. v. Landry , 372 A.2d 573, 576 (Me. 1977); Canal 
National Bank v. SAD No. 3 , 160 Me. 309, 203 A.2d 734 (1964).   While Maine law has converged 
in some respects with federal law as to the Contract Clause analysis, the decision in Landry  has 
never been overruled.  Kittery Retail Ventures, LLC v. Town of Kittery , 2004 ME 65, ¶ 41 n. 7, 
856 A.2d 1183.  This raises addi tional questions regarding the constitutionality of the bill.  
  III. Other legal considerations. 
 
A. LD 1708 creates substantial liability for the people of Maine, including legal fees.  
Aside from the substantive constitutional defi ciencies in L.D. 1708, the bill raises further 
difficulties for the State of Maine.  Procedurally, a constitutional challenge to LD 1708  would be 
pursued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, exposing the State to paying the plaintiff’s attorneys fees when 
the plaintiff utility prevails.  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Typically, utility condemnations take many years 
of litigation, creating fees potentially in the millions for both sides of the dispute.
3  
 Notably, there is no way for the State to escape these risks if and when courts address the flaws 
in the bill.  The State would, at the very le ast, have to pay compensation and fees for a 
                                                           
3 E.g. Sacramento Municipal Utility District (23 years) ; Long Island Lighting Company (13 years); Las 
Cruces (NM) / El Paso Electric (12 years); City of  Nashua (NH) / Pennichuck Water Company (10 years); 
City of Boulder (CO) / Xcel Energy (9 years and counting).  
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  8 
 
temporary taking if the utility whose assets are se ized ultimately prevails in court in arguing 
that the taking was illegal or the compensation mandated by the bill on its face is too small – even if the State wanted to change its mind about the taking (even assuming that were statutorily possible, given that the bill does not so provide) and not create a public municipal 
corporation.  There would be no non-State- backed bonding mechanism to pay for those 
attorney’s fees and compensation – the State it self, and thus Maine taxpayers, would be liable 
and have to pay these sums.
4 
 Indeed, if LD 1708  survived legal scrutiny with only the infirmity found by the court the bill’s 
attempt to divide between “utility facilities” an d “utility property” for purposes of determining 
the extent of the taking and thus just compensation, there is no going back once property has 
been taken.  Under such circumstances, the pe ople of Maine would have to pay whatever an 
impartial tribunal found to be the actual fair market value of the seized utilities as going 
concerns.  Accordingly, no matter how high the purchase prices and how much the debt service 
will be required to pay for these multi-billion doll ar seizures, the people would be on the hook 
for the full cost because the bill requires a comp lete pass-through of all of the public municipal 
corporation’s borrowing costs.  There would be no escape from rising rates for consumers. 
 
B. LD 1708’s referendum provision crea tes additional legal issues. 
LD 1708’s referendum provision creates unconscionable results when viewed in conjunction 
with LD 194, which prohibits participation by foreign government-owned entities in referendum 
campaigns.  Because some T&D utilities in Maine (such as Versant Power) might qualify as a 
foreign government-owned entities under LD 194, it  is possible that adoption of both LD 194 
and LD 1708 would leave such utilities without re course to participate in the Pine Tree Power 
referendum campaign – even though, if successful , the referendum campaign would result in a 
taking of their property.  Prohibiting an entity from participating in a campaign that could result in a deprivation of its property is the height of  unfairness and raises a host of due process and 
free speech concerns.  See VAMOS, Concertacion Ciudadana, Inc. v. Puerto Rico , 494 F. Supp. 3d 
104 (D.P.R. 2020) (law restricting participation in referendum campaign violated due process 
and the First Amendment); Opinion of the Justices , 461 A.2d 701 (Me. 1983) (concluding that 
limitations on corporate participation with re spect to “political referenda and other such 
measures” would violate the First Amendment).   
C. LD 1708 creates labor law issues. 
LD 1708 also would create substantial issues  under federal and state labor laws.  LD 1708 
                                                           
4 Typically, the compensation that must be paid fa r exceeds what was origina lly contemplated by the 
condemnor, even with an original understanding of the fair market value measure.  For example, in the City of Missoula’s acquisition of Mountain Water, the City acquired the water utility at almost twice the price originally projected and was separately ordered to  pay certain litigation costs.  The City of Nashua 
calculated $85 million to acquire Pe nnichuck Water Company, and the New Hampshire Public Utilities 
Commission ordered payment of $203 million.  The costs of the state-wide T&D seizure contemplated in 
LD 1708 would far exceed these amounts given the size of the taking contemplated by the bill.     
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  9 
 
purports to make the employees of the operator “p rivate employees” with all the rights of such 
employees under the law.  This provision, ho wever, is likely legally ineffective and the 
employees of the operator hired to operate the T&D systems for Pine Tree Power would be 
found to be “public employees” under federal and state law.  As such, the employees would not 
have rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and instead would be subject to 
Maine law governing labor relations for public employees.  Under Maine law, these public employees would not have the right to  strike.  26 M.R.S.  § 964(2). 
 The operator would not be an employer subject to  the NLRA.  Any employer that is a “political 
subdivision” of a state is not subject to the NL RA.  29 U.S.C. § 152(2).  The Supreme Court has 
stated that any entity “administered by individua ls who are responsible to public officials or the 
general electorate” constitutes a political subdivision.  NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility District of 
Hawkins County, 402 U.S. 600, 605 (1971).  Any operator would clearly be responsible to public 
officials.  The Pine Tree Power Company is governed by an elected board, § 4002, has the power of eminent domain, § 4003, is a public m unicipal corporation for tax purposes and may 
issue tax exempt bonds, § 4005, and is subject to FOAA, § 4008.  The Supreme Court has found that these factors demonstrate that an employer is a political subdivision.  Hawkins County , 402 
U.S. at 606-09 (utility district was a politic al subdivision because its commissioners were 
appointed by an elected official and it had the power of eminent domain, was subject to 
freedom of access laws, and could issue tax exempt bonds). 
 
Because Pine Tree Power Company is a political subdivision of the State, it is a “public 
employer” for purposes of the Maine Public Empl oyees Labor Relations Law.  Maine law defines 
a “public employer” to encompass any “political subdivision” as defined under the NLRA.  See 
26 M.R.S. § 962(7)(b)(2) (“public employer” includes “any employ er not covered by any other 
state or federal collective bargaining law that is  . . . administered by individuals responsible to 
public officials or to the general electorate”).  It does not matter, for purposes of Maine law, 
that a private company would operate the utility on behalf of the Pine Tree Power Company.  
The Maine Law Court has held that a private enti ty “acting on behalf of” a municipality is 
nonetheless a “public employer.”  Baker Bus Serv., Inc. v. Keith , 416 A.2d 727, 730-31 (Me. 
1980) (finding that a private business entity hired to operate school buses for a municipality was “for all practical purposes, the alter ego  of the municipality” and must be treated “the 
same as the municipality itself”).  Accordingly,  the operator’s employees would be treated as 
employees of the municipal corporation created under LD 1708 – with all the restrictions that 
classification entails.  Maine law prec ludes public employees from striking.  See id. § 964(2). 
 Even if the operative provisions in LD 1708 ma king the employees of the operator “private 
employees” could be enforced under state and federal law, the NLRA would pre-empt the 
portion of Section 4003(4) which purports to mandate that the operator must honor the existing collective bargaining agreements of th e investor owned T&D utilities.  Under the NLRA, 
a state cannot tell a private employer what to include in its CBA.  See Golden State Transit Corp. 
v. City of Los Angeles , 475 U.S. 608, 613-19 (1986) (cit y preempted from entering upon 
substantive aspects of the bargaining process by  imposing conditions on the employer).  At 
most, a state can set “minimum standards,” like a minimum wage, but it cannot dictate terms 
 
{W13136254.2.2.2}  10 
 
and conditions.  That must be left to collective bargaining be tween the operator – employer 
and the bargaining unit.    
IV. Conclusion 
The bill is constitutionally flawed and will therefore put the State of Maine, and its taxpayers 
and ratepayers, in an untenable position.  It s referendum provision and labor provision also 
create significant legal problems.  Accordingly,  I respectfully encourage the Committee to vote 
LD 1708  ought not to pass.
