Testimony in Opposition to LD 1611
 
An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit, Customer
-
owned Utility
 
May 20, 2021
 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the committee, my name is James Cote and I
 
am here today on behalf of Versant Power to testify in opposition to LD 1611. 
 
 
As you have heard from Versant Power, the company is eager to continue working with legislators, regulators and 
stakeholders to help facilitate the major energy transitions und
erway and to accomplish our state’s ambitious 
climate goals. We understand the imperative that this be done quickly, while ensuring continued reliability and 
affordability for customers.
 
 
Unfortunately, the significant delay, cost and risks associated with
 
LD 1611 would take us further away from 
those shared goals and would mean the loss of critical years in our fight to mitigate the impacts of climate change 
and a transformational energy future.
 
 
Despite our legal and policy disagreement with the proponent
s of this initiative, Versant Power is eager to engage 
in a realistic discussion with all stakeholders about how we, as a utility and as a state, can best meet the challenges 
ahead, including improving customer service and reliability, maintaining affordab
ility, modernizing our grid and 
facilitating the transition to a decarbonized economy.  We share these goals, which the legislature has identified as 
being critical to our state and believe that a seizure of Maine’s investor
-
owned utilities 
–
 
and the billi
ons of 
dollars of costs and years of delay it would cause 
–
 
risks derailing our progress toward achieving them.
 
Cost, Delay and Uncertainty
 
A fundamental and adversarial restructuring of the energy sector in Maine could effectively freeze huge amounts 
of investment in the state and create massive regulatory uncertainty during a transition period of indeterminate 
length and with no guaranteed o
utcome. 
 
 
Maine’s ability to achieve our energy and climate goals, and our desire see our economy as a whole recover and 
thrive, is predicated upon fostering an environment in which significant investment and job creation are sound 
business decisions. The 
massive uncertainty created by this takeover would not only affect investors in the energy 
industry, including developers integrating renewable sources, but would touch every part of Maine’s economy. 
What energy
-
intensive industrial or manufacturing busine
ss, agricultural operation, or institution could justify or 
finance major investment in Maine without knowing what their energy costs will be or even with whom they will 
be working?
 
 
The final cost of such a takeover, which will determine whether ratepayer
s realize any long
-
term benefit or if 
they, more likely, will find themselves ultimately responsible for massive amounts of debt and higher bills, will 
be determined by lengthy and expensive litigation and appeals. Reasonable adjustments to the unrealistic
ally 
optimistic assumptions made by the proponents of LD 1611, which take into account real
-
world experience with 
similar scenarios (e.g. the actual costs, including profit, paid to similarly situated private operators; the actual 
acquisition multiplier in
 
other adversarial seizures, albeit on smaller scales, etc.), suggest that the costs to

ratepayers may well be considerably higher than initially projected. 
 
 
Additionally, we believe it is wise for us to now look at such an acquisition and associated cost
s in terms of the 
world we are currently living in. Interest rates of all kinds are far different and higher than when this initiative was 
first unsuccessfully proposed two Legislatures ago. If nothing else, asking ourselves the question
-
 
“could you still 
purchase a home with a 2.5% interest rate today?”
-
 
seems applicable. Any independent analysis that has been 
done certainly did not anticipate what the markets look like today. 
 
 
These massive sums 
–
 
billions of dollars by all accounts, we are told 
–
 
will b
e balanced by claims of low
-
cost 
borrowing and other nebulous cost
-
savings. However, the high risk of lending to an untested, politically governed 
and inexperienced entity in a volatile regulatory environment, and the experience of other jurisdictions, mak
e such 
savings difficult to imagine being realized while the costs would be all too certain.
 
 
Perhaps most importantly, such a takeover will almost certainly delay the State’s progress on a number of critical 
policy fronts including climate action. The uti
lities, developers, policymakers and other stakeholders will be 
unable to make tangible progress, potentially for years, due to massive uncertainty about who will be “across the 
negotiating table” in the future. Given the need to move quickly and decisivel
y, if we are to mitigate the worst 
impact of climate change, we simply cannot waste 4, 7, or 10 years without moving forward.
 
Misuse of Eminent Domain
 
Versant Power believes that the use of eminent domain in the manner proposed in LD 1611 is unconstitution
al. 
The proposed takeover does not meet the requisite public necessity test to exercise eminent domain, and the 
Public Utilities Commission has already determined that service from a customer
-
owned utility is not sufficiently 
different from service from an
 
investor
-
owned utility to warrant a public necessity finding. 
Kennebunk Light & 
Power District,
 
Docket No. 2002
-
196 (Me. P.U.C., Jan. 24, 2003) p. 12. The Commission noted: A public desire 
to be served by a particular utility is not a sufficient reason, s
tanding alone, to make the legal determinations that 
the utility is delivering a different service or that there is public need for the service.

Existing Regulatory Regime & LD 1959
 
We agree with the sentiment that public utilities that offer cr
itical services ought to be held to high standards by 
regulators to ensure customers are receiving quality service. In Maine, due to actions taken by this Committee, we 
have recently added more regulatory tools to ensure utilities provide the best service 
possible for their customers, 
and those tools are now being put to use. 
 
 
The Commission already has the tools it needs to prioritize reliability and customer service in rate cases, to 
penalize utilities for errors or miscalculations, and even to rescind t
he authority of a utility to do business in the 
State for cause under Section 1511.

A M.R.S. § 1511 provides “The commission may, in an adjudicatory proceeding, suspend or revoke the authority of a public util

upon a finding that the
 
public utility is unfit to provide safe, adequate and reliable service at rates that are just and reasonable. The commission 
shall 
provide notice and a reasonable opportunity for the public utility to comply with its obligations under this Title prio

In other words, there is no need to force customers to wait years for an ultimately empty determination, and spend 
billions on an acquisition for these concerns to be addressed. With clear guidance, thoughtful policy and improved 
communication among the Co
mmission, the Legislature and the utilities, realistic solutions for these issues can be 
identified and implemented without this bill and the turmoil it would create.
 
Additionally, the Legislature passed LD 1959, 
An Act Regarding Utility Accountability and
 
Grid Planning for 
Maine's Clean Energy Future, just last year. This legislation was the most comprehensive utility reform effort that 
Maine has undertaken in decades. The Public Utilities Commission has begun to undertake the directives for 
which they are
 
responsible and utilities and stakeholders are working diligently in those dockets. The Legislature 
should continue to monitor that effort and allow it a chance to succeed before opting for a proposal as extreme as 
the one contained in LD 1611. 
 
 
Ratepayer Expense of System Operation
 
The purpose of this new company as described in the bill is in alignment with the existing purposes of the 
incumbent utilities, but under a quasi
-
governmental ownership model rather than a private one. 
 
Proponents of t
his legislation have repeatedly claimed that they will realize savings by eliminating the profit 
motive from the utilities, keeping dollars here in Maine and using the money to invest in the grid. At the same 
time, however the bill proposes to hire an Oper
ator of this system to provide “private
-
sector operations.”
 
The new company will need funds to hire such an Operator, either from debt, to be paid back by customers 
(Maine people), or from profits earned from customers. 
 
 
That Operator will inevitably be a
 
company, that company will have shareholders, and those shareholders will 
require a profit in exchange for their services. Profit will not have been removed from the system, it will only 
transfer from one private entity to another, all at the expense of M
aine ratepayers.
 
 
Profit for a new private operator is unlikely to be insignificant and no doubt will far exceed the unrealistic 
projections made by the proponents. In Long Island, LIPA provides the closest organizational example to the Pine 
Tree Power Com
pany. LIPA also serves a similar number of customers, though in a significantly less challenging 
environment given the density of its customer base and geography/weather of its much smaller service territory. 
LIPA also replaced a single utility, LILCO, and
 
was not required to integrate three separate service territories 
(including one not currently electrically interconnected with the other two). 
 
 
It is our understanding that proponents are claiming that the Pine Tree Power Company will only pay a fraction
 
of 
the management fee to a for
-
profit private operator that Long Island Power Company pays PSEG, despite the 
numerous factors making the management of Maine’s three service territories significantly more complex. 
Is it 
realistic to expect that Maine will 
find a company to take on this task, including the unique regulatory, political,
 
 
authority of a
 
public utility to provide service pursuant to this section. The authority granted in this section is in addition to the commi
ssion's authority 
under section 1321.”

geographical and systems challenges we face, anything significantly less than what another company requires in a 
significantly less complex territory?
 
 
This 
legislation explicitly prohibits CMP or Versant Power from being selected as the initial private sector 
operator, guaranteeing that the Operator would be a company based outside of Maine, given no other private 
entities with the necessary experience to ope
rate the grid currently exist in the state. Dollars would not be “kept in 
Maine,” they would only begin flowing to an out of state Operator rather than a Maine
-
based company such as 
Versant Power.
 
 
It seems unnecessary to engage in a years
-
long legal battl
e (paid for by customers and Maine citizens), incur the 
cost of establishing and transferring ownership of complex systems and confidential information to a new entity, 
only to hire the exact employees who are being criticized as providing unsatisfactory s
ervice, and to pay a 
different company’s shareholders a profit for operating the
 
system.
 
 
 
 
Taxation and PILOTs
 
 
Maine’s investor
-
owned electric T&Ds
 
pay over
 
$80 million
 
annually
 
in local property taxes to Maine 
municipalities.
 
Last year, Versant paid ove
r $16.5
 
million in property taxes to
 
over
 
180 
Maine
 
municipalities.
 
This is not optional for Versant, and the company takes no issue with the requirement that 
it pay its share to support the communities in which it operates. As a privately owned company, V
ersant does not 
have, nor will it ever have tax
-
exempt status 
-
 
the income taxes and property taxes it pays are consistent, reliable 
income for the state and the municipalities it serves.
 
There is no such guarantee for a company that is an instrument of th
e state. The tax obligations of the new 
company only exist due to legislation that could be repealed if doing so is ever politically expedient.
 
When the state is faced with political pressure to reduce rates while also making significant investment, will i
t 
continue to pay property taxes, or will customers see those costs shift onto their individual municipal budgets? 
The payments described in the bill could well be at risk in times of economic uncertainty or when another policy 
priority needs to be funded,
 
potentially leaving communities without critical revenues unless they significantly 
increase individual property tax rates. This dynamic has played out repeatedly in Maine as elected officials have 
cut municipal revenue sharing in order to fund other poli
cies, forcing communities to raise property taxes and or 
cut services. 
 
It is also important that the Committee look further into questions raised by the State Treasurer in his testimony 
the last time this policy was considered. Specifically, he stated:
 
Th
e sponsor is well aware, and the Committee should keep in mind that the Rostenkowski rule
 
would likely make initial financing of a public power entity taxable. Refinancing could occur
 
later. Determination of tax status of debt like this is fact
-
 
specific a
nd the issuer must meet
 
several requirements.

We would encourage the committee to carefully consider such questions as:
 
•
 
How does refinancing occur for such a large amount of debt?
 
•
 
Is the ability to refinance guaranteed?
 
•
 
What facts determine tax 
status?
 
•
 
What requirements are considered in this fact
-
specific tax status litmus test?
 
Ultimately, the tax status of this debt could have enormous implications for the State of Maine, and Maine people 
and businesses generally. We should know the answer to 
these questions and others before committing ourselves 
to such an enterprise.
 
Conclusion
 
Though this bill raises many additional questions, let me conclude by noting that Versant Power understands that 
there are competing needs in our efforts to 
modernize the grid, improve resilience, and meet the State’s renewable 
energy goals. This Legislature wants important things for our citizens. Renewable energy. Distributed generation. 
Grid modernization. Improvement of technological support systems for th
e grid. Investments in traditional 
infrastructure, like poles and wires. Investments in our future, like energy storage, and complex interconnections. 
Investments to protect these precious resources from changing weather patterns and ever evolving security
 
concerns.
 
 
Realistically, accomplishing these goals will require hard work and significant expense. Versant Power cannot 
accomplish them on our own, nor can any one entity. But we are here to be a trusted partner in these efforts, to 
work alongside the St
ate using the tools it already has to both correct any errors and to cooperate on successes. 
We believe that we will get where we need to go if we engage with each other as partners, rather than waste 
another moment or another penny on anything that impede
s or risks our efforts to move quickly and thoughtfully 
forward.
 
 
We would be happy to provide you with any information as requested for the work session. Thank you
 
for your consideration.
