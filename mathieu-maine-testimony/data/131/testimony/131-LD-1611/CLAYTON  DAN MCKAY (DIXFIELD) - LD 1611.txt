LD 1611
Chair Lawrence, Chair Zeigler and Honorable Persons of the EUT Committee
LD 1611 was obviously written by someone who detests Central Maine Power wants 
to drag Versant into the abyss of a governmental nightmare.
This author of this bill must also hate the constitution that guarantees private property 
protection against hostile seizure, rather by group of elected officials or even by a 
majority of citizens. 
I have a good idea where this bill originated as I am sure you, on the committee have 
figured out.
If this bill gets even one vote of "Ought to Pass"  I fear this person who votes as such 
is strictly a hater of not only a private power company but loathes the people of 
Maine.
Common sense, common law and the common good shall send this bill to the bowels 
of hell, where it belongs.
