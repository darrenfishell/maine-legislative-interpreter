Senator
Lawrence,
Representative
Zeigler ,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on 
Ener gy ,
Utilities,
and
T echnology ,
my
name
is
W ayne
R.
Jortner .
For
23
years,
I
was
one
of
3 
senior
counsel
at
the
Public
Advocate,
until
2014.
I
was
involved
since
the
drafting
stage
of
the 
underlying
legislation
to
create
the
Pine
T ree
Power
Company
–
legislation
that
was
eventually 
enacted
by
the
full
Maine
Legislature
–
but
vetoed
by
Gov
Mills.
That
led
to
the
successful
drive 
to
get
the
issue
on
the
ballot
so
voters
can
decide
in
November .
This
is
an
opportunity
to
have
a
utility
with
incentives
that
exactly
align
with
the
interests
of
its 
customers
and
the
local
community .
First,
let
me
point
out
that
the
Public
Utilities
Commission
(PUC)
is
not
a
pur ely
public
inter est 
agency
and
it
was
never
designed
to
be
one.
Maine’ s
ratemaking
statute
directs
the
PUC
to 
balance
inter ests
of
ratepayers
and
shareholders.
In
my
two
plus
decades
of
observing
Maine’ s
system
of
utility
regulation,
it’ s
been
clear
to
me 
that
the
odds
have
always
been
stacked
against
ratepayers
in
that
balancing
act.
Utilities
hold
all 
the
key
financial
information
.
Consider
the
teams
of
high-priced
lawyers
and
lobbyists
employed 
by
private
shareholders
of
investor -owned
utilities
(IOUs).
Another
factor
to
consider
is
that 
many
if
not
most
PUC
commissioners
came
from
the
utility
industry
–
and
so
have
a
couple
of 
our
Public
Advocates.
While
that
trend
could
continue,
it
will
no
longer
matter
when
a
utility’ s 
management
and
customers
are
no
longer
in
competition
with
one
another .
That’ s
when
the
PUC 
could
become
a
truly
public-interest
regulator
of
our
T&D
utilities.
CMP
and
V ersant
unfortunately
bear
the
bill’ s
defined
characteristics
of
utilities
that
are
unfit
to 
serve,
including
repeatedly
being
in
the
lowest
decile
in
customer
satisfaction
accor ding
to
JD 
Power ,
lowest
decile
in
fr equency
of
outages
,
and
highest
decile
in
rates,
Maine
having
the
7
t h
highest
rates
in
the
US
–
except
parts
of
Maine
served
by
non-profit
electric
utilities.
The
new
PTP
will
have
a
refreshingly
new
statutory
mission
that
is
very
dif ferent
from
our 
existing
electric
utilities.
It
must
provide:
●
af fordable
safe,
reliable
service,
(same) 
●
timely
and
accurate
billing,
(IOUs
have
had
problems) 
●
encourage
interconnection
of
renewable
generation
(new) 
●
promote
internet
access
(new) 
●
lower
cost
of
capital
and
lower
rates
than
IOUs
(new) 
●
economic
justice
for
workers,
(new) 
●
support
State’ s
climate
action
and
economic
growth
goals,
(new) 
●
Last
but
certainly
not
least,
accountable
governance.

Contrast
this
focus
on
local
control
and
benefits
to
local
ratepayers
--
with
the
status
quo
–
which 
is
now
manifested
by
CMP
being
a
small
part
of
a
lar ge
foreign
holding
company
with 
significantly
foreign
and
governmental
shareholders.
Their
purpose
is
to
extract
maximum 
profits
and
take
them
away
from
the
Maine
economy .
Anybody
who
is
scared
of f
by
the
debt
to
be
created
by
the
acquisition
cost
should
understand 
that
multiple
highly
qualified
economists
demonstrated
that
this
will
substantially
save
money 
for
Maine
people
-
think
of
it
as
switching
from
a
very
expensive
rental
to
owning
a
house
with
a 
mortgage.
In
this
case
the
financing
costs
go
from
expensive
costs
of
capital
-
profits
for 
shareholders,
to
low ,
tax-free
municipal
bond
financing.
Rates
will
be
lower
as
a
result
while 
servicing
the
debt
over
time.
As
for
governance,
the
leadership
will
not
be
partisan
as
others
would
have
you
believe
–
this 
whole
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
partisan
politics.
Allowing
the
people
to
vote
for
board 
members
is
called
democracy .
Despite
scare
tactics
about
financial
risks
to
taxpayers
or
the
State,
that
concern
is
entirely 
unfounded
because
the
bill
you’re
considering
explicitly
prohibits
that
scenario.
There
is
neither 
taxpayer
funding
nor
taxpayer
liability .
Let’ s
bring
the
benefits
of
lower
rates,
enhanced
reliability
and
better
customer
service
currently 
enjoyed
by
customers
in
10
parts
of
Maine,
to
all
the
people
of
Maine.
Send
this
bill,
as
written, 
to
the
people
of
Maine.
Sincerely ,
W ayne
R.
