To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to express my support for LD1611, An Act to Create the Pine Tree 
Power Company, a Nonprofit, Customer-owned Utility.
If you get terrible service from a restaurant, you can go to any number of other 
restaurants instead. If you get terrible service from a power company, you are stuck 
with them. CMP has shown over and over, by not investing in fixing the problems 
that cause their frequent and extended outages, that their only loyalty is to their 
foreign parent company and its shareholders. It's time for them to go. 
I encourage you to put this issue before the voters, so we can invest our utility 
payments in fixing and expanding the grid in the state of Maine and stop sending 
outrageous profits abroad.
