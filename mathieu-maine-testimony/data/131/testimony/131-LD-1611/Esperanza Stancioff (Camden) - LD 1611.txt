My career in Maine for decades as an Extension Professor has been to work in Maine 
communities on adaptation and mitigation efforts based on the impacts from a 
changing climate. Creating Pine Tree Power Company is a critical step in 
development of renewable energy sources for current and future generations. It is  
critical to establish a fair, consumer owned, not for profit company for greatly 
improved service, reliability and less costly energy to Maine customers.
