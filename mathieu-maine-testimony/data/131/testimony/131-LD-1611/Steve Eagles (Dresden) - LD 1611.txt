Members of the Joint Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology, I thank you 
for your attention.  I will be brief in supporting the creation of a consumer owned 
non-profit electric utility for us Mainers. 
 I have been a customer CMP for over 50 years and have watched as the service 
declined after CMP was sold to Avangrid with no consumer permission.  We had no 
choice in giving our power company to a much larger conglomerate.  In response to 
consistent power outages in our small town, most of my neighbors have had to buy 
generators which are a significant cost.  Customer satisfaction is clearly a lower 
priority than shareholder return on investment with Avangrid and Iberdrola.
I have worked hard to gather signatures for this bill and I ask that you give Maine 
citizens the opportunity to again lead the way in reaching carbon neutrality with our 
own power company.
