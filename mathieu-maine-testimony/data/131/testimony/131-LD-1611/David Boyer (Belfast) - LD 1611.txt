The public/private partnership that is necessary for effective production of 
distribution of electric power needs to have the public part of the partnership 
strengthened in order to further the transition to a cleaner energy system. The people 
need to have this choice put to them. This will further that transition and strengthen 
democracy. Send it on to the people.
