How can we expect to keep Maine's economy strong when we keep sending over 
$100 million dollars out of the state (and out of the country) every single year? That is
what is happening right now, with CMP and Versant as the state's main electricity 
providers. When Mainers pay for electricity, they pay more than they should because 
their bills include large profit margins to fatten the pockets of shareholders who own 
CMP and Versant's parent companies in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. To 
make things worse, CMP now wants to increase our rates by almost 50%. Why do we 
allow this? Well, we shouldn't. By voting to create the non-profit, consumer-owned 
Pine Tree Power Company to replace CMP & Versant, we can keep more money in 
Maine's economy and pay less for our electricity. Instead of foreign shareholders 
making decisions about our electric grid, Mainers will be able to elect Mainers to 
make those decisions. It just makes senses. For profit power companies are designed 
to make money from their consumers. Consumer-owned power companies are 
designed to be accountable to their consumers. Voting "yes" to create the Pine Tree 
Power Company is in Maine's best interest.
