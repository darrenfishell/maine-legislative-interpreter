An Act to Create the Pine Tree Power Company

Chairman Lawrence, Chairman Zeigler , and members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee:  
 
My name is Scott Mahoney.    I am Senior Vice President – General Counsel & Corporate 
Secretary at Avangrid, Inc.  I attended Maine Law School and raised our family in Manchester 
and now live in Freeport.  I am before you today to  oppose  LD 1611 , “An Act to  Create the Pine 
Tree Power Company, a Nonprofit , Customer -owned Utility.”  These written comments address 
at a high level  some of the legal infirmities of the proposed legislation.  I have attached a 
memorandum  from Pierce Atwood LLP addressing LD 1708 (130th Legis.)  that analyzes these 
issues in more detail , because  LD 1611 presents similar  legal concerns as were implicated in LD 
1708 (130th Legis.).  I do not describe all of the legal issues in this testimony, because they are 
adequately described  in the memorandum.  The major issues with LD 1611 are as follows.  
 
LD 1611  creates substantial potential liability for the State of Maine.   Because the legislation is 
unconstitutional, it will generate lengthy and complex litigation in which the State cou ld end 
up, at a minimum, paying the attorneys’ fees incurred by the utility companies in striking down 
the law.   LD 1611 is unconstitutional for several reasons . 
 
LD 1611 creates an unlawful taking of private property .  Both the U.S. and Maine Constitutions 
prohibit the taking of private property without just compensation.  U.S. Const. amend. V; Me. 
Const. art. I, § 21.  LD 1611 neither meets the exigency test necessary for a taking, nor provides 
for just compensation.  
 
• For a taking to occur lawfully  under the Maine Constitution , there must be both a public 
purpose and public exigency.  Blanchard v. Dep’t of Transp ., 2002 ME 96, ¶ 27, 798 A.2d 
1119.  There is no public purpose or exigency  for the taking; LD 1611 would not 
guarantee great er reliability or lower rates .   To the contrary, the bill would require 
ratepayers to pay the complete cost of service, including debt service, no matter how 
high the interest rate, and with no regulatory constraint for the rates to be just and 
reasonable .  In addition, it would require the government to hire a private gird operator, 
at a profit, to manage and operate the grid.  Transfer of ownership is all that LD 1611 
would accomplish —but that reflects no public purpose or exigency.   
 
• Further, any takin g must be accompanied by just compensation for the owner.  The 
touchstone for just compensation is fair market value.  See Curtis v. Maine State 
Highway Comm’n , 160 Me. 262, 266, 203 A.2d 451, 453 (1966).  The distinction in LD 
1611 between “facilities” an d “property” – requiring purchase of utility “facilities” but 
 
2 
 merely permitting the purchase of utility “property” – runs afoul of the requirement to 
provide just compensation because it is a transparent effort to avoid paying 
compensation for the value of  the seized utility as a whole.  The property taken by LD 
1611 includes the utilities’ right to operate as a going concern.  As such, the proper 
measure of a taking includes more than just physical assets and property rights; it 
includes the value of the g oing concern as well.  East Boothbay Water Dist. v. 
Inhabitants of the Town of Boothbay Harbor, 158 Me. 32, 177 A.2d 659 (1962). We have 
the recent  examples of the fair market value  of a utility business and the range for 
Maine is between $12 billion and $15, billion.  Compare this massive increase in debt to 
the current debt of the Maine Turnpike and the University of Maine combine d -- $1.5 
billion .  The legislature should compare the debt to seize these utility businesses with 
the debt of the State of Maine.     
LD 1611 is inconsistent with the Due Process Clause, Commerce Clause, Equal Protection 
Clause , and Contracts Clause .   
 
• LD 1611 violates  due process for various reasons.  For example, the “fitness to serve” 
criteria in the bill include customer satisfaction rankings by unspecified private survey 
organizations.  This would unlawfully delegate powers to private companies .  Corning 
Glass Work s v. Ann & Hope, Inc. of Danvers , 363 Mass. 409, 423 (1973).  Further, not all 
the assets needed for CMP’s T&D delivery system to function properly are located 
within the State of Maine.  An attempt to seize property outside the borders of the 
State violat es due process.  Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v. Delta & Pine Land Co ., 292 
U.S. 143, 149 (1943) . 
 
• The Commerce Clause prevents states from burdening interstate commerce through the 
exercise of the takings power.  Given the interrelated nature of the int erstate power 
T&D system, the condemnation proposed in the bill runs afoul of the Commerce Clause.  
Burlington N. v. Fort Bend County , 2009 WL 1172704, at * 2 -3 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 29, 2009).  
 
• L.D. 1611 violates equal protection principles.  The bill discrimin ates between privately 
owned and “consumer -owned” T&D utilities based on no articulated or apparent 
rational basis.  Such discrimination is suspect under Maine law.  Dickinson v. Maine Pub. 
Serv. Co. , 233 A.2d 435 (Me. 1966).  
 
• L.D. 1611 also implicates the Contract s Clause because it  unlawfully destroys public 
utilities’ franchise right to serve exclusively absent a necessity finding under 35 -A M.R.S. 
§ 2102 by seizing T&D utility assets.  Black v. Bureau of Parks & Lands , 2022 ME 58, ¶¶ 
36-47, 288 A.3d 346.  
LD 1611 creates other substantial issues.  Even if the law were not struck down in its entirety 
as unconstitutional, the State would still be at substantial risk.  Because the bill does not 
 
3 
 provide for paying just compensation to the owner of the seized utilities for the value of the 
utility as a going concern, the people of Maine would have to pay for the attorneys’ fees 
incurred by the utilities in pursuing the proper measure of compensation and would also have 
to foot the bill for paying the difference between the amount of compensation contemplated in 
the bill and the utilities’ value as a going enterprise.   
 
These costs would be substantial, and, because there would be no non -State -backed bonding 
mechanism to pay for those attorneys’ fe es and compensation, the State (and thus Maine 
taxpayers) would have to pay these sums.  Typically, the compensation that must be paid far 
exceeds what was originally contemplated by the condemnor, even with an original 
understanding of the fair market valu e measure.  For example, the City of Nashua calculated 
$85 million to acquire Pennichuck Water Company, and the New Hampshire Public Utilities 
Commission ordered payment of $203 million.  The costs of the state -wide T&D seizure 
contemplated in LD 1611 woul d far exceed these amounts given the size of the taking.    
 
Nor will LD 1611 provide any offsetting financial benefit to Maine.  A professional study and 
resulting whitepaper published  by Concentric Energy Advisors, issued in May 2021, “there is a 
reasonable potential for a $4.7 billion net cost to Maine electric customers.”  Whitepaper: 
Analysis of Government -Controlled Power in Maine, May 2021,  at 2,  available at 
https://maineaffordableenergy.org/wp -content/uploads/2021/12/Whitepaper -Analysis -of-
Government -Controlled -Power -in-Maine.pdf .   
 
The bil l is constitutionally flawed and will therefore put the State of Maine, and its taxpayers 
and ratepayers, in an untenable position.  Accordingly, I respectfully encourage the Committee 
to vote LD 1611  ought not to pass.
