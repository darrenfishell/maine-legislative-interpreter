The Secretary of State's proposed ballot question for the direct initiative that will 
appear on the November 7, 2023 ballot should be sent to Maine voters, with the 
wording as updated on May 3rd ("Do you want to create a new power company 
governed by an elected board to acquire and operate existing for-profit electricity 
transmission and distribution facilities in Maine?"), but with "a new power company" 
replaced by "a new nonprofit power company", as this would clarify the one 
ambiguous issue in the language currently proposed.
