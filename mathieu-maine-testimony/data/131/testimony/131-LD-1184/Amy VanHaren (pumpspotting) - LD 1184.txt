LD 1184
On behalf of Pumpspotting, I am reaching out for your support of LD 1184, an act to 
exempt certain prescribed home medical equipment and supplies from sales tax. This 
legislation is important to breastfeeding moms in the great state of Maine, especially 
during a time when families are still facing infant formula shortages. Currently, there 
is no straight sales tax exemption for breastfeeding equipment or supplies like there is
for other home medical equipment and supplies under MRS Sales, Fuel, & Special 
Tax Division Instructional Bulletin No. 41. While we would prefer a full sales tax 
exemption of breastfeeding equipment and supplies, especially since infant formula is
exempt, we feel this bill would also help families that purchase prescribed breast 
pumps, parts, and milk storage bags using their insurance benefit.
Breastfeeding and thus the feeding of human milk to children has been associated 
with improved health and lower health care costs (family and societal) resulting from 
fewer physician visits, hospitalization stays, prescriptions, and other illnesses and 
diseases. The cost-savings of tax-exempt breastfeeding equipment and supplies will 
go a long way to further promote, support and protect breastfeeding in Maine. 
Providing tax exempt breastfeeding equipment and supplies can result in increased 
breastfeeding rates, infant growth rates, lower infant morbidity and mortality rates, 
reduced health disparities, and cost-savings.
