Testimony of Adele Weaver – North Yarmouth, ME 
In OPPOSITION to LD 1214 “An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perfluoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination” 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
April 26th, 2013 
                                                                
                                                                      
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. My name is Adele Weaver.  I am graduating from Greely High School 
this year and heading to college in Maine in the fall.  I submit this testimony in opposition to LD 
1214, “An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
Contamination.” 
 
This year, I was part of the Greely Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition team where 
we were State Champions, working to address the nationwide PFAS crisis. We have worked with 
PFAS researchers at the University of Maine, Orono (Dr. Apul and Dr. Chardhoury), who are 
experts in this field and provided us with crucial information which led to a deeper 
understanding of the issue. We also met with ECT2, a company at the forefront of remediating 
PFAS contamination around the country and world.  
  
Among other things, LD 1214 would change the definition of what is considered PFAS. 
This means manufacturers can create a new compound that is equally harmful, if not more, and it 
won’t be considered PFAS because it's not couched under the same definition. It would further 
the problem of PFAS, and give more power to manufacturers and not the people.  
 
I hope you consider the impacts of this bill on future generations and do what is right for 
the citizens of Maine.   I urge you to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1214. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
Adele Weaver 
North Yarmouth, ME
