RE:  Support  LD 1214/ SP 495  
An Act to Clarify the Laws Related to PFAS Contamination  
 
Dear Chair Brenner , Chair Gramlich,  and Memb ers of the Joint  Standing Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources :  
 
The Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association1 (PIMA) r espectfully requests your support 
of LD 1214/SP 495 that would clarify Public Law 2021 chapter 477 , which requires reporting of products 
with intentionally added PFAS and would ban products with intentionally added PFAS as of January 1, 
2023 , unless the De partment of Environmental Protection  determines that the use of PFAS in the product 
is an unavoidable use.  
 
PIMA supports Maine’s interest in protecting the health and wellbeing of the state’s citizens and the 
environment. LD 1214/SP 495 is consistent wit h this goal while addressing concerns with existing law 
that would otherwise eliminate critically important uses and benefits of PFAS chemistries. Specifically, 
LD 1214/SP 495 improves the definitions included in current law, provides for an important one (1) year 
extension of applicable reporting deadlines, and eliminates unnecessary  and duplicative provisions.  
 
PFAS are a critical chemistry to so many industries that operate and do business in Maine. We appreciate 
the Committee’s attention to our concern s and encourage the support of LD 1214/SP 495.   
 
Sincerely,  
 
Justin Koscher  
President
