Testimony of Timothy J. DelGiudice in support of LD 1214 - An Act to Clarify the Laws to 
Combat Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination_ 
Good morning, my name Tim DelGiudice, and l am a Director of Government Relations at 
Raytheon Technologies, the parent company of Pratt & Whitney located in North Berwick, 
Maine. l would like to express our strong support for amendment L.D.1214, which will make 
important improvements to the state's new PFAS law. 
As you may know, Pratt & Whitney is a leading manufacturer of aircraft engines with over 2,200 
well-payingjobs here in Maine. At Raytheon Technologies, we are committed to ensuring that 
our products are safe and environmentally responsible, and that is why we support L.D.1214. 
L.D.1214 better defines scope and compliance requirements, protects confidential business 
information, and allows more time for the government and industry to get this first-in-the- 
nation PFAS law right as it will serve as a model across the country. l believe this amendment; 
represents an important opportunity for Maine to continue leading the way in protecting our 
environment. By working together with our elected officials, community & business leaders, 
we can ensure Maine becomes an even safer and healthier place to live and work. 
In conclusion, I ask that you support amendment L.D.1214. Thank you!
