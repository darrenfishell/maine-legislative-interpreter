Re: Committee Hearing on PFAS Related Bills, in Support of LD 1214 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members on the Joint Standing Committee of 
Environment and Natural Resources: 
The American Coatings Association (”ACA”)1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on LD 1214, An 
Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perf/uoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination, and 
other PFAS-related bills currently before the committee. The Association's membership represents 90% 
of the paint and coatings industry, including downstream users of chemicals who manufacture end-use 
formulated products. ACA appreciates the committee's willingness to interact with stakeholders during 
this process. We are optimistic that through continued involvement with the public and stakeholder 
community, Maine will successfully implement a program to manage products containing PFAS 
chemicals. 
PFAS encompasses a variety of fluorinated chemistries with very distinct physical and chemical 
properties, used in a variety of products. Maine's adoption of a broad PFAS definition inevitably 
captures a diverse range of reportable chemicals, whose reporting through one standardized approach 
proves challenging, due to complexities in the supply chain and difficulty in identifying reportable 
chemicals across thousands of products. This complexity is compounded by the current compliance date 
of January 1, 2023. To date, Department of Environment (hereinafter, ”DEP") has not finalized 
implementing rules specifying reporting methods. 
ACA is testifying in support of LD 1214. LD 1214 addresses problems in implementation of An Act To Stop 
Perfluoroalkyl and Po/yfiuoroalkyl Substances (L.D. 1503, 130"‘ Legislature) that prevent effective 
reporting of products containing PFAS chemistries. LD 1214 would focus the definition of PFAS, provide

ACA is a voluntary, non-profit trade association working to advance the needs of the paint and coatings industry 
and the professionals who work in it. The organization represents paint and coatings manufacturers, raw materials 
suppliers, distributors, and technical professionals. ACA serves as an advocate and ally for members on legislative, 
regulatory and judicial issues, and provides forums for the advancement and promotion of the industry through 
educational and professional development services. ACA's membership represents over 90 percent of the total 
domestic production of paints and coatings in the country.

a blanket extension for reporting and specify a standard for claims related to confidential business 
information. 
l. LD 1214 would provide a more feasible definition of PFAS. 
By modifying the definition of PFAS to include compounds with two or more sequential fully fluorinated 
carbon atoms, the bill would allow companies and DEP to focus on tracking chemicals that are 
associated with contamination. The focus of remediation programs has been on fluorinated chemistries 
of 3-4 fluorinated carbons or more. EPA recently proposed listing PFAS chemicals as hazardous under 
CERCLA focusing on 7 PFAS chemicals that are all longer than one fluorinated carbon atom? Typically, 
contamination is not associated with short chained PFAS substances of one carbon with fluorine. 
The change in definition proposed in LD 1214 also harmonizes with the federal definition EPA proposed 
in its PFAS reporting rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act. EPA’s definition is: 
any chemical substance or mixture that structurally contains the unit R-(CF2)-C(F)(R')R ”. 
Both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons. None of the R groups (R, R’ or R") 
can be hydrogen? 
Here, EPA’s definition includes compounds with two or more fluorinated carbons, but not one 
fluorinated carbon. Again, the purpose here is to require reporting of PFAS chemistries associated with 
contamination, while reducing some of the complexity of compliance. Even with this "streamlined" 
definition, the agency is likely to receive information related to about 600 or more fluorinated chemicals 
and thousands of products. 
ll. LD 1214 harmonizes reporting times with a blanket extension and uniform 
reporting date. 
ACA also supports the extension of the reporting deadline to January 1, 2024, as proposed in LD 1214. 
DEP is in the process of finalizing reporting requirements while developing an online submission 
platform. When complete, companies that reported by January 1, 2023 would need to supplement their 
notification in the online system. By providing a blanket extension, the agency would be able to manage 
submissions within one uniform timeframe while companies also can rely on one submission date, 
assuming DEP is able to finalize rules sufficiently in advance of a compliance date. 
Several companies received extensions of the reporting deadline. These extensions would presumably 
remain in effect with passage of LD 1214. DEP provided reporting extensions for 2,400 companies. These 
companies would be required to submit reports within six months after DEP finalizes its implementing 
rules.

lll. LD 1214 establishes a benchmark for claims related to confidentiality. 
ACA further supports the proposal in LD 1214 to allow for claiming confidential information under the 
”laws of the State and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act." This reference would provide a general standard 
related to claiming confidential information. Under the Act, CBI claims are evaluated based on 
consideration of economic value derived from protection of claimed CBI from disclosure. This concept is 
adopted into the Uniform Trade Secrets Act at 10 M.R.S. 1542(4). The act also provides general 
definitions related to CBI. 
IV. LD 1537 would implement an unrealistic reporting deadline and an unnecessary product 
phase-out requirement. 
While noting its support for LD 1214, ACA does not support changes to PFAS reporting proposed in LD 
1537. LD 1537 would implement anew reporting deadline for products with intentionally added PFAS by 
October 1, 2023. This deadline is not feasible, considering that DEP struggled to evaluate and grant 
extensions, currently in effect, for the prior reporting deadline oflanuary 1, 2023. DEP is also in the 
middle of a rulemaking process that is unlikely to be completed with enough compliance time to meeta 
deadline of October 1. Product manufacturers require ample time to track and report PFAS through 
their supply chain. 
LD 1537 would also implement an unnecessary and vague requirement for DEP to adopt one “product 
category ” to phase-out per year, starting January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029. Under LD 1503, 
Section 5, currently in effect, DEP already has the authority to identify products with intentionally added 
PFAS that cannot be sold or distributed in the State. 
V. Conclusion' 
ACA appreciates the opportunity to comment on bills to manage PFAS in the State of Maine. For the 
reasons articulated herein, ACA supports passage of LD 1214 and does not support passage of LD 1537. 
Please feel free to reach out to me if I can provide any additional information.
