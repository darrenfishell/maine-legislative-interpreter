RE:  Legal Impact of PL 2021 c. 477 on C&L Aerospace 
 
 
To the Members of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources: 
 
I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with further information regarding the 
legal consequences of PL 2021 c. 477 (“the PFAS reporting law”) on our client, C&L 
Aerospace (C&L), specifically to address an erroneous claim made at the public 
hearing on LD 1214.   
 
As Chris Kilgour, CEO of C&L, indicated, approximately 40% of the company’s 
business consists of repairing and refurbishing aircraft.  C&L must obtain any one of 
400,000 different parts to repair a standard aircraft depending upon the type of 
work being performed.  Roughly half of those parts are brand new.   
 
Every one of these new aircraft parts would be considered a "product" under 38 
MRSA §1614 1 (G), defined as “an item manufactured, assembled, packaged or 
otherwise prepared for sale to consumers, including its product components, sold or 
distributed for personal, residential, commercial or industrial use, including for use 
in making other products.”  
 
Whether the manufacturer is deemed to have sold the “product” to C&L for 
purposes of repairing the aircraft or C&L is deemed to have sold the “product” to 
the end user, the PFAS reporting law as written covers the sale of that aircraft part.  
Pursuant to 38 MRSA §1614 5 (D) and the Department’s interpretation of the law, 
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has the authority to ban the use 
of that aircraft part if it contains intentionally added PFAS.

#15991711v1 The other half of C&L’s business is selling aircraft parts.  Most of these parts come 
from aircraft that are decommissioned.  Since these parts are used, the DEP would 
not be empowered to prohibit the sale or resale of those products.  However, 20% 
of the parts C&L sells are new, and would be subject to DEP prohibition.   
 
Further, the reporting requirement of the statute, 38 MRSA §1614 (2), applies to all 
products.  As we understand the Department’s interpretation of the law, C&L is 
obligated to report on the presence of PFAS in anything it sells, irrespective of 
whether the part is new or used.  Thus, C&L is unable to comply with the reporting 
requirements of the PFAS reporting law.  Compliance would be extraordinarily 
costly, take multiple years to complete and would not even cover the majority of 
PFAS substances for which there are no available analytic testing methods.   
 
Accordingly, we would reiterate our support for an amendment to PL 2021 c. 477 
that would clarify federal preemption language as outlined in Chris’ written 
testimony.  Alternatively, the Committee should direct the DEP to identify the uses 
of PFAS that are essential to the health, safety or the functioning of society and for 
which alternatives are not available and exempt those uses from the reporting 
requirement.  We would be pleased to work with the Committee to accomplish this 
objective.
