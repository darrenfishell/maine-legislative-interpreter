RE: Support - LD 1214/ SP 495 An Act to Clarify the Laws Related to PFAS Contamination  
 
Dear Co-Chairs Brenner  and Gram lich and Members of the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources,   
 
The Ameri can Chem istry Council  (ACC) respectfully requests your sup port for LD 1214/SP 495 
that would provide clarification to Public Law 2021 Chapter 477 , which requires reporting of 
products with intentionally added PFAS and would ban products with intentionally added PFAS 
as of January 1st 2030, unless DEP determines t hat the use of PFAS in the product is an 
unavoidable use.  
ACC  recognize s Maine’s interest in managing PFAS contamination to protect the health of the 
state’s citizens and the environment. LD 1214/SP 495 furthers this goal by making the 
necessary changes t o definitions in current law that would address concerns with certain PF AS 
chemistries while allowing critically  important uses and benefits of these chemistries.  
LD 1214/ SP 495 would also enable greater compliance with the law by providing companies a 
one-year extension of the deadline for reporting of products containing  intentionally added 
PFAS. Although the reporting requirement was scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2023 , 
the DEP granted thousands of manufacturers an extension in recognition o f the complications 
related to reporting including delays in rulemaking,  difficulty in obtaining and protecting 
confidential business information protected by intellectual property laws, disruptions in the 
global supply chain, and lack of laboratory testin g capacity. A one -year extension of the 
reporting requirement date would  allow manufacturers and the DEP to work through these 
issues.  
 
Lastly, the proposed bill removes the ban on any products with PFAS by January 1, 2030 unless 
DEP identifies it as an un avoidable use. This provision is unnecessary and duplicative given 
that the law states DEP can by rule identify products or categories of products that cannot be 
sold or distributed.

As you know , nearly every sector of the economy , including aerospace, a utos, alternative 
energy, healthcare, building and construction, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, 
relies on PFAS chemistries for the reliable and safe function of a variety of products .  
 
ACC encourages the support of LD 1214/ SP 495 as a sen sible solution to protect health and 
the environment while providing regulatory clarification and certainty to impacted companies.  
 
Thank you .  
 
Sincerely,
