• I am a Maine resident, living in South Berwick, Me. I’m speaking today in support of LD 1214.  
• As an individual, I’m concerned with the availability of registered products in our state because of 
the current definition of "intentionally added PFAS" and "perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances." The current definition is far too broad.  
• Refining the definition as proposed in 1214 would allow for businesses and companies operating in 
our state to comply, while ensuring that we protect residents and our environment. 
• By passing LD 1214, you will help ensure that we have access to products for use in the state. 
Draft Message/Testimony:  
Thank you to Chairwoman Brenner and Chair Gramlich, and members of the Joint Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Mike DeForge, and I 
live in South Berwick. I’m speaking to you all today in support of LD 1214, “An Act to Clarify the Laws to 
Combat Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination”. This legislation, is appropriately 
named as it will provide clarity to current law, on the definition of "intentionally added PFAS" and 
"perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances." Refining the definition would help ensure that 
businesses and companies that operate in our state are able to comply with the law, while ensuring that 
we have registered products available. I ask that the Committee to support LD 1214.
