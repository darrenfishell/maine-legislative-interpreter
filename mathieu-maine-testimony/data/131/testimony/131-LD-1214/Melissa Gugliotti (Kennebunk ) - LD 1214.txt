Kennebunk 
LD 1214
Thank you to Chair Brenner and Chair Gramlich, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources for the opportunity to speak 
today. My name is Melissa Gugliotti and I live in the town of Kennebunk.
 
I am speaking to you today in support of LD 1214, “An Act to Clarify the Laws to 
Combat Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination”.
 
As an individual, I am concerned that the current definition of “intentionally added 
PFAS” and “perfluroalkyl and polyfluroalkyl substances” is entirely too broad and 
would unintentionally eliminate far more economically critical products than the true 
targets of the PFAS legislation.
 
Refining the definition would help ensure that businesses and companies that operate 
in our state are able to comply with the law, while ensuring that we have sufficient 
registered products available to protect our residents and our environment.
 
I respectfully ask that the Committee support LD 1214.
