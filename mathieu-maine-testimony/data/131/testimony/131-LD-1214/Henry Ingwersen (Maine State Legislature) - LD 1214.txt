Testimony in Opposition to LD 1214 
Testimony of Senator Henry Ingwersen 
In Opposition to LD 1214 “ An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perﬂuoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances ” 
Before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee 
April 26, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. My name is Senator Henry Ingwersen, and I represent Senate District 
32, including the City of Biddeford and the towns of Lyman, Dayton, Hollis, and Arundel. I 
am before you today to present and speak in opposition to LD 1214 “ An Act to Clarify the 
Laws to Combat Perﬂuoroalkyl and Polyﬂuoroalkyl Substances. ” 
I am in opposition to this proposed legislation for a couple of very important reasons. First, 
LD 1214 proposes to change the definition of PFAS. Maine’s current deﬁnition is not only in 
LD 1503, the products ban bill, but is also the consistent deﬁnition used in a bill to test 
farmland, the sludge ban bill, and in our current drinking water standards bill. The definition 
proposed in LD 1214 leaves out a whole host of harmful chemicals, including several PFAS, 
adjuvants, and precursors. This new definition means that several toxic PFAS could still be 
used in products. Maine is not the only state that utilizes our current statutory deﬁnition of 
PFAS. There are at least 18 other states that do so. As a quick example of the problems with 
the deﬁnition proposed in 1214 - production of another dangerous PFAS, PFOA, was 
terminated in the U.S. after the EPA pressured chemical manufacturers to move to safer 
alternatives. DuPont’s replacement for PFOA is the new PFAS chemical known as GenX 
which has been identiﬁed as a severe toxicant which impacts the liver, kidneys, immune 
system, the development of offspring and an association with various cancers. It is the major 
source of contamination in the Cape Fear area of North Carolina. Based on this toxicity, EPA 
released a draft lifetime health advisory for GenX in drinking water of only 10 parts per 
trillion based on the severe health risk presented by GenX. GenX is also included in EPA’s 
proposed national drinking water standard for PFAS. GenX’s chemical structure contains 
multiple ﬂuorinated carbon atoms, but they don’t sit right next to each other — they are not 
sequential, in the language of LD 1214. Under the proposed deﬁnition, Maine DEP would 
lose the ability to track GenX.’ 
This bill also eliminates the main provision of LD 1503, which is meant to reduce the sources 
of PFAS in the state. Considering the amount of contamination that the state is currently 
struggling with, and the more than $100M in tax dollars we are utilizing to clean up the 
contamination, we need to do all we can to prevent further contamination. This means we 
need to reduce the sources of PFAS here in the state. Getting rid of LD 1503 will continue to

allow toxic PFAS to be utilized in the state, which means more contamination and more tax 
dollars used to remediate the problem. Not to mention the severe health impacts on those 
who are dealing with the contamination and the burden on their families. Maine may have 
been the ﬁrst state to pass legislation to ban all non-essential uses of PFAS in products but we 
will not be the last. As we speak, Michigan and Minnesota both have legislation making their 
way through their respective legislatures that follows Maine’s lead on this issue and other 
states will follow. Industry would be well—served to work with the state of Maine to move away 
from these toxic chemicals so they are prepared as other states follow. 
It is for these reasons that as a legislator, a Maine citizen, and a neighbor to a farm family 
whose lives, health, and livelihoods have been devastated by these terrible forever chemicals, 
I ask you to join me in opposing LD 1214.
