Good Morning,
My name is Paul Peters, I am a commercial fruit grower from Monmouth.  In 
addition, I am an independent agronomic crop consultant and the Vice President of 
the Maine Vegetable and Small Fruit Growers Association.
The PFAS issue in pesticides is the most devisive and unsettling issue I have ever 
witnessed in Maine Agriculture.  One could suggest that Maine's  position on 
regulating PFAS is progressive, and that Maine will be looked a  leader in national 
environmental matters.
    I suggest the opposite has occurred.  The issue is regressive and fear based.. 
Opinion and policy have  occurred prior to sound scientific review of the potential 
risks. Damage has occurred from this policy to the morale of the farm community and
potential market impact of Maine farm products.
If Maine's definition of PFAS containing products, becomes consistent
with EPA"s, then this issue can be dealt in a more orderly and progressive way.
please support LD 1214.
Paul Peters, CCA
