Testimony 
Ornamental Horticulture Council 
Jesse O'Brien, Spokesperson 
In Favor of LD 1214 
”An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perﬁuoroalkyl and Polyﬂuoroalkyl 
Substances Contamination" 
Senator Brenner and Representative Gramlich and members of the joint 
committee on Environment and Natural Resources, my name is Jesse O'Brien, l 
live in Portland and I am the spokesperson for the Ornamental Horticulture 
Council. Our group consists of greenhouses, arborists, garden centers, 
landscapers, Christmas Tree Growers, golf course superintendent's and turf care 
operators, all of whom care about the environment. 
0 We are in favor of LD 1214. Speciﬁcally, LD 1214 changes the deﬁnition of 
PFOS to align with the EPAs deﬁnition. 
0 We realize this is a complex subject 
u We are also concerned of unintended consequences of not having "Tools in 
our Tool box" for pest out breaks 
Finally, we look forward as the research and solid science continues to evolve on 
these to deal with these PFAS chemistries. 
Thank you for your time, 
Jesse O'Brien, Spokesperson
