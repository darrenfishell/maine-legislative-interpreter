RE: Support - LD 121 4/ SP 495 An Act  to Clarify t he Laws Related t o PFAS 
Contamination 
Dear Chair B renner a nd Members o f the Committee on Environment and N atural 
Resources,    
SWD Urethane respectfully r equests y our su pport of LD 1214/SP  495 that w ould 
provide clarification t o Public L aw 20 21 chapter 477 which requires r eporting of 
products with intentionally added PFAS and would ban products with intentionally 
added PFAS as of Januar y 1st 2030, unless DEP determines that the use of PFAS  in 
the product is an unavoidable use.  
SWD Urethane recognize s Maine’s i nterest  in managing PFAS c ontamination to protect 
the health of t he state’s ci tizens a nd the environment. LD 1214/SP 4 95 furthers t his go al 
by making the nec essary ch anges t o definitions i n current l aw that w ould address  
concerns w ith certai n PF AS ch emistries wh ile allowing critically important use s and 
benefits o f these chemistries.   
LD 12 14/ SP 495 would als o enabl e greater c ompliance with the law by pr oviding 
companies a one ye ar extension of t he deadline for r eporting of pr oducts  containing 
intentionally a dded PFAS. A lthou gh the r eporting requirement w as scheduled to go into 
effect  on Ja nuary 1 , 2023, t he DEP gr anted thousands o f manufacturers an extension in 
recognition of t he complications r elated to r eporting including delays i n rulemaking, 
difficulty i n obtaining a nd protecting confidential busi ness  information protected by 
intellectual pr operty l aws, disruptions i n the global su pply ch ain, and l ack of l aboratory 
testing ca pacity.  A on e-year ext ension of t he reporting requirement date would allow 
manufacturers a nd the D EP to work through t hese issues.  
Lastly,  the proposed bi ll removes t he ba n on any pr oducts w ith PFAS by Ja nuary 1, 
2030 unless  DEP identifies i t as an unavoidable use. T his pr ovision is unn ecessary and 
duplicative  given that t he law st ates D EP ca n by r ule identify pr oducts or ca tegories of 
products t hat ca nnot b e sol d or di stributed.

As you know , nearly every sector of the economy , including aerospace, autos, 
alternative energy, healthcare, building and construction, electronics, pharmaceuticals, 
and agriculture, relies on PFAS chemistries for the reliable and safe function of a variety of products .  
 
SWD Urethane  encourages the support of LD 1214/ SP 495 as a sensible solution to 
protect health and the environment while providing regulatory clarification and certainty 
to impacted companies.
