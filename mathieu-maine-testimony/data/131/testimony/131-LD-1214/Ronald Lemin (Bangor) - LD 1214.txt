Thank you to Chair Brenner and Chair Gramlich, and distinguished members of the Joint Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources for the opportunity to listen to my concerns. My name is Ronald 
Lemin, I am a licensed forester and Maine commercial pesticide applicator living in Bangor, Maine.  I 
would like to express to you my support for LD 1214, “An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat 
Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination”. This legislation, is appropriately named 
as it will provide clarity to current law on the definition of "intentionally added PFAS" and 
"perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances." Refining the definition would help ensure that 
businesses and companies that operate in our state are able to comply with the law, while ensuring that 
we have registered products available. Many of the products I currently use are not registered in Maine 
by the manufacturer.  When I ask the manufacturer why, I was informed that they WILL NOT register 
their products until Maine can define PFAS in a more scientific manner and be more in line with the way 
EPA is defining PFAS.  I ask that the Committee support LD 1214.
