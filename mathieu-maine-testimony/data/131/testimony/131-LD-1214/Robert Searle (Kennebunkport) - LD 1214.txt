Robert Searle
Kennebunkport
LD 1214
Dear Chair Brenner and Chair Gramlich, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources,
My name is Robert Searle, and I live in Kennebunkport. I’m writing to you all today 
in support of LD 1214, “An Act to Clarify the Laws to Combat Perfluoroalkyl and 
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Contamination”. This legislation, is appropriately named 
as it will provide clarity to current law on the definition of "intentionally added 
PFAS" and "perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances." Refining the definition 
would help ensure that businesses and companies that operate in our state are able to 
comply with the law, while ensuring that we have state and federally registered 
products available. I ask that the Committee to support LD 1214.
