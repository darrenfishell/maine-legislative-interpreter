l.D 558 
To Chairpersons Anne Carney, Matt Moonen, and the members of the Judiciary Committee 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and 
Managers Association, GBAOMA. 
0 I am also a member of the Legislative Council representing landlords and property 
owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, 
Auburn, and the Bangor areas. 
0 I have been a landlord since 1972. I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , multi-units, and 
single-family homes. At one time, I managed 65 units. I have mostly provided 
affordable housing to low-income tenants. 
0 I strongly oppose this Bill. 
0 There are too many potential sources of information to regulate LD S58. 
0 One example, what if another tenant in my building sees me showing a vacant unit toa 
person they know to be bad tenant, and shares that information with me. What if my 
current tenant knows the potential tenant can not get along with others, is a heavy 
drinker, uses and sells drugs. What if my current tenant tells me ifl rent to the new 
tenant, he will be giving his notice to leave. 
Q According to this Bill, I can not refuse to rent to the new tenant because I did not tell him 
about the source of the information, that I did not know I was going to receive from my 
current tenant. 
0 I am here to ask you to OPPOSE LD 558.-
_ 
¢ Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I would be happy to answer any 
questions.
