Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
Capital Area Housing Association
LD 558
March 24, 2023
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee:
We are testifying in opposition to LD 558.
My name is Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don. I am current President of Capital Area Housing 
Association, a landlord association in Augusta area. Currently we have 197 members 
and 45 (23%) of those members live in the same building, 39 of them (20%) own 1 
unit, 150 of them (76%) own 5 units or less. We are small landlords. Most of our 
members like me have regular job or retired.  They mow the lawns, snow blow 
driveways, clean their properties, and do whatever property maintenance by 
themselves allowed by the law.
We have to screen prospective tenants by checking credit reports and background 
checks. We must comply with the Maine Human Rights Act and the Federal Fair 
Housing Act in how we screen tenants. This bill is unnecessary burden to landlords.
We urge you to oppose LD 558.
Thank you. 
Ratnasiri Liyanage-Don
President, Capital area Housing Association                                                                       28
