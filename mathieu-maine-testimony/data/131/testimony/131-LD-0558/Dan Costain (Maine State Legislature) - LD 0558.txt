Testimony in Support of Constituent Bill LD 558 
“An Act Regarding Rental Housing Applications ” 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary. I’m Dan Costain, State Representative for 
House District 33 which includes the towns of Corirma, Dixmont, Etna, Newpoprt 
and Plymouth. I’m here today in support of LD 558, “An Act Regarding Rental 
Housing Applications. ” 
The intent of this bill is to provide transparency to a prospective tenant that is 
going through the rental application process. Currently, a landlord can chargea 
fee for each member of a dwelling when conducting the screening process, often 
without the upfront knowledge of the prospective tenant. I would like to see just 
one fee per family per landlord for a 30 day period. 
This bill would require a landlord or agency on their behalf to inform the tenant of 
the process and what areas would disqualify an individual(s) from a successful 
completion. This includes, but isn’t limited to, background checks and credit 
checks. In addition, this will prohibit a landlord from charging any payment, fee 
or charge for the processing, review or acceptance of a rental application more 
than one time in a 12-month period. 
I believe this to be a transparent approach, especially at a time when the cost of 
housing continues to see increases throughout our state. 
I ask you to join me in supporting this bill in the name of fairness to those that are 
seeking housing. 
Thank you and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
District 33 Corinna, Dixmont, Etna, Newport and Plymouth
