Committee Chairs and Members:
Another well intended Bill thoroughly documented in Federal Law and Medicare 
policy. The templated marketing materials for Medicare Supplement products clearly 
show whether Part B Excess Charges are paid by plans A-N. (See attached chart, next 
to bottom row, from CMS Medicare & You - Publication 10050 is mailed annually to 
every beneficiary. This is from 2022; however, the chart is updated and published 
annually.) This bill seeks to mandate the obvious. This may be an agent training issue 
at best and does not require further burdens placed on our already overworked Bureau
of Insurance. 
Next, Medicare Rules allow balanced billing of excess charges capped at 15% above 
the Medicare allowed rate. In my decade plus years of experience in the senior 
insurance sector, with a base of nearly 800 customers, I have yet to have one case of 
balance billing for Excess Charges. This is a far less than 1% issue. Again, the agent 
involved failed to address balance billing or individual failed to comprehend and 
commit to memory that possibility. Most individuals retain approx. 30% of content 
delivered during a sales meeting. As a former "re-educator" for an insurance 
company, people hear what they want more than what's being told, especially when 
premiums are involved. 
Respectfully, this bill Ought Not to Pass from Committee. It places extra burdens on 
the Bureau, is already well documented in marketing materials, and extremely rare 
occurrence. 
Any individual believing, they were harmed by this situation should be directed to 
legal counsel and file a claim against the agent's Errors and Omissions policy to cover
their damages. 
Respectfully,
