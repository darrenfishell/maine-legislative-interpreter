Committee Chairs and Member’s:
I am very sorry I was unable to be present for your Public Hearing on LD's 
1354/1497. There was a substantial amount of misinformation provided by some at 
the podium early in the hearing.
A "typical example" of a Part B excess charge.
A person buys a United Healthcare Medicare Supplement "N' plan to save money 
over a "G" plan ($549.00/year if age 65 non-tobacco rate.) I’m only using that brand 
for premium purposes. 
The buyer has a medical event and goes to the emergency room. As part of diagnostic 
testing - X-rays are taken. The per diem radiologist on duty does not accept Medicare 
Reasonable and Customary charges nor use the hospital for billing services. They may
bill Medicare directly for services rendered.  Let's assume a radiologist’s normal 
charge is $300.00. Medicare Reasonable and Customary rate is $200.00. The 
radiologist will receive:
Medicare will pay 80% of $200 or $160. The "N" plan would pay $40 the other 20%. 
And the radiologist is allowed to bill the customer 15% Excess Charges or an 
additional $30 to cover their billing and administrative costs. The remaining $70 due 
to the radiologist would be written off as a discount against other income.
The buyer/patient would have received the CMS Medicare & You book 10050, a 
MediGap Buyer’s Guide 02110, and the plan enrollment document all stating their 
“N” Plan did not cover Excess Charges. Confusion between the N and G would likely
occur if the agent rushed through the sales process describing both products in the 
same setting. 
These situations are extremely rare. As stated in earlier testimony, with 800 customers
over the last decade – this issue has not been brought to my attention. 
Again, my position is both bills Ought Not to Pass. I concur with the lobbyists’ 
testimony both bills have significant language issues requiring significant attention by
experts in this senior insurance products.
