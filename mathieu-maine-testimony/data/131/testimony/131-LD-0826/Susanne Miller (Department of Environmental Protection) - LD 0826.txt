Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am 
Susanne Miller, Director of the Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management at the 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), speaking in opposition to L.D. 826. 
This bill proposes in part to prohibit placing or facilitating the placing of any heavy metal- 
containing commercial solar panels into a solid waste disposal or incineration facility in 
Maine, or othen/vise burying, incinerating, depositing, or dumping these materials. The 
bill further describes that a heavy metal-containing commercial solar panel is a solar 
panel not designed for residential use that contains more than a de minimis amount of

arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, selenium or silver. While this may seem like an 
effective way to reduce heavy metals entering Maine's environment, there are broader 
implications to this legislation. 
First, waste materials that contain heavy metals must undergo a test known as the 
Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) to determine if certain materials, like 
the metals identified in this bill, are likely to leach into the ground. The TCLP test itself is 
a simulation of leaching potential through a landfill and generally provides a pass/fail 
rating along with an amount or concentration of each metal contaminant present in the 
material tested. If a material fails the TCLP, the waste must be managed as hazardous 
waste pursuant to 06-096 C.M.R. ch. 850, § 3(B)(5) and may not be accepted bya 
typical solid waste landfill or incinerator, nor may it be disposed of by burial, burning, 
depositing, or dumping in Maine. 
In the event that that commercial solar panels with heavy metals do pass the TCLP test 
they would not need to be managed as a hazardous waste, however at this time it is 
unclear how many solar panels would fall into this category. If the majority of 
commercial solar panel wastes were able to pass the TCLP, locations would be 
required for proper disposal, recycling or reuse of these materials. An outright 
prohibition of disposal options as outlined in this bill would effectively ensure that there 
would be no place in Maine to properly manage solar panel wastes. Since there are no 
recycling or reuse facilities for solar panel wastes in Maine, this means that all solar 
panel wastes would be required be shipped out of state adding transportation costs as 
well as contributing to generation of greenhouse gases. 
At this time the infrastructure for solar panel recycling is just emerging, and the market 
for secondary reuse of solar panels is evolving. Organizations like the Solar Energy 
Industries Association (SEIA) are working to establish partnerships to develop and 
encourage recycling and reuse of the components of solar panels while ensuring

components that cannot be recycled or reused are properly disposed. On the recycling 
and reuse front, concerns still need to be ironed out relating to electrical grid 
interconnection regulations, as well as fire, building, and electrical codes that must 
be examined in planning for solar panel reuse. 
The long-term horizon suggests that both industry, government (including discussion 
among states including Maine), and recycling organizations all support recycling of 
solar panels. However, at this time the nearest to Maine solar panel recycling facility 
is located in Ohio. There are also only a few of these facilities scattered around the 
United States. Because the infrastructure is not yet fully developed for recycling or 
reuse, the bill would in effect ban disposal of solar panels in Maine, require out of 
state disposal, and would not necessarily enhance recycling as the available options 
for recycling are not yet widely available. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
