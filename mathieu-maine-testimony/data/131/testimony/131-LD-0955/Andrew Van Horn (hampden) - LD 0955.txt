Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan
and
other
members
of
the
Educational
and
Cultural
Committee,
My
name
is
Andrew
V an
Horn,
and
I
currently
work
as
a
custodian
at
Hampden
Academy
in
Hampden.
I’ve
been
an
employee
of
RSU22
since
2018
and
in
my
short
time
with
the
district
I
have
consistently
seen
the
need
to
increase
wages
for
support
staf f.
It
is
my
belief
that
LD955
will
lead
to
an
environment
that
increasingly
values
support
staf f.
W orking
as
a
support
staf f
member
has
been
a
transformative
experience
for
me,
connecting
me
with
my
community
in
a
way
that
I
would
never
have
considered
when
I
was
younger .
I
believe
that
LD955
and
bills
like
it
would
serve
to
draw
in
a
younger
pool
of
employees
while
increasing
the
longevity
of
commitment
to
the
work
of
supporting
education,
which
is
regularly
changing
and
evolving.
When
I
started
working
as
a
custodian
at
Reeds
Brook
Middle
School
in
2018
my
work
was
more
or
less
what
I
expected,
focused
solely
on
cleaning.
But
as
I
became
more
experienced,
known
and
trusted
within
the
school
community
my
duties
eventually
grew
to
include
stopping
traf fic
to
keep
the
students
safe,
monitoring
student
lunches,
and
participating
in
the
after
school
tabletop
gaming
club.
During
the
COVID
shutdown,
while
teachers
and
administrators
were
doing
nearly
all
their
work
from
home,
the
custodians
and
other
support
staf f
members
were
labeled
as
essential
workers
and
were
asked
to
risk
their
health
to
keep
school
facilities
as
operational
as
possible
to
best
serve
our
communities.
It
is
my
belief
that
LD955
and
bills
like
it
are
a
good
way
to
show
that
we’re
also
essential
enough
to
pay
a
living
wage.
Education
support
staf f
member ’ s
value
should
not
be
based
solely
on
educational
credits.
It’ s
surprising
how
often
those
fail
to
reflect
a
person’ s
actual
intelligence,
or
their
commitment
to
education
overall.
Paying
people
an
initially
higher
wage
would
serve
to
attract
a
greater
number
of
candidates
who
would
find
value
in
the
work
done
to
support
education.
There
have
been
positions
in
the
custodial
department
at
RSU22
that
went
unfilled
for
over
a
year ,
placing
strain
on
a
staf f
already
stretching
to
accommodate
for
a
lack
of
resources.
I
hope
this
letter
serves
to
illuminate
the
need
to
pay
education
support
staf f
members,
the
people
who
keep
our
schools
open
and
operational,
more.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Andrew
V an
Horn
