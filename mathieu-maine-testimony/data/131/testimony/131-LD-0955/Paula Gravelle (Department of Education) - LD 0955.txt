Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 955, An Act to Address Shortages of School Support Staff by Increasing the Minimum 
Hourly Wage for Those Staff, proposes a minimum hourly wage for school support staff in an 
amount equal to 125% of the state minimum hourly wage beginning in the school year starting 
after June 30, 2024. The bill also indicates that any year the state minimum wage is increased, 
the school staff minimum wage will be correspondingly increased by 125% by July l of that 
year. LD 955 further outlines a deﬁnition of school support staff to mean all public school 
employees who are not school administrators and are not certified teachers or career and 
technical education teachers subject to the existing minimum salary requirements. 
The Maine education community continues to struggle with an educator workforce shortage. 
Our educational support staff are a valuable resource to our education ﬁeld, and increasing the 
minimum salary for these positions is an important aspect of growing and strengthening the 
Maine educator workforce. 
Title 20-A, §l567l outlines several deﬁnitions for various levels of school staff as related to the 
Essential Programs and Services (EPS) funding formula. The Department of Education does not 
collect the needed detail of salary data for these positions. As such, we are not able to account for 
the ways LD 955 may impact State education funding and school administrative unit budgets. 
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 955 and respond to 
any questions during the upcoming work session. 
Sincerely,
