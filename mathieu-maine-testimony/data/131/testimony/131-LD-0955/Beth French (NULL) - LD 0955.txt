Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee, 
My name is Beth French. l’m a National Board Certified Teacher with 21 years of experience 
and the local president of RSU 71 Education Association. I fully support LD 955 “An Act to 
Address Shortages of School Support Staff by Increasing the Minimum Hourly Wage for Those 
Staff.” 
We have reached crisis level staff shortages in public education in all job categories but support 
staff have been disproportionately impacted. Private sector jobs in retail and sen/ice industries 
have become more attractive as private sector wages have increased. These jobs do not come 
with the same certification standards, rigorous evaluation schedules, fingerprinting, background 
checks and CDL licensing requirements that are required by our public schools. Essentially, our 
support staff are flocking to jobs in the private sector community that pay comparable wages for 
far less responsibility and fewer headaches than that of public school support staff jobs. In RSU 
71 we have seen staff shortages in bus drivers, food service and Ed techs. We do not presently 
have enough substitutes in these positions so we experience the added stress of staff being 
pulled from their jobs to cover staff vacancies on a regular basis. This is stressful on both staff 
and students and is not a long term solution to this problem. In order to recruit and retain 
essential support staff we need to increase ESP wages to support a livable wage and restore 
the respect that these exceptionally hard working educators deserve. Please join me in 
supporting LD 995. 
955' 
Thank you.
