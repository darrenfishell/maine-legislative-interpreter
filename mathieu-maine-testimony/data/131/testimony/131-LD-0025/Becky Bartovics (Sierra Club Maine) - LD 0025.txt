Re:
Testimony in Support of LD 25:
An Act To Provide
Indigenous Peoples Free
Access To State Parks
Chairs, Senator Ingwersen and Representative Pluecker , and Members of ACF, my
name is Becky Bartovics, and I am writing as a volunteer with Sierra Club Maine,
representing over 22,000 supporters and members statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra
Club is one of our nation’ s oldest and largest environmental organizations. W e work
diligently to amplify the power of our 3.8 million members and supporters nation-wide.
We urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 25.
LD 25 provides that any tribal member of the federally recognized tribes of Maine would
have complimentary access to all of our State Parks and historic sites. Long before we
colonizers seized them, Maine’ s indigenous people stewarded these lands. It seems
only fair and just that we of fer free access to these resources to the original inhabitants
of Maine’ s Parks so many residents already enjoy for free (Disabled V eterans and
seniors). W abanaki families deserve access to lands they formerly cared for . Healing
wounds through access to the natural world will have broad benefits to the individuals
and likewise to the State of Maine. Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 25.
Sincerely ,
Becky Layton Bartovics
