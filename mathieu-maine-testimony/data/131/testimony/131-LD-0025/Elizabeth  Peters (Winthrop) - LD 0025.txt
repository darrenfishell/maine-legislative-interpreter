Dear Sirs and Madams of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee and the 
Legislature and Senate at large:
I asked Senator Craig Hickman to spearhead this addendum to allow free access to any state
run park or historical monument by members of any federally recognized tribe.  I did so 
because as a member of the Aroostook Band Of MicMac, I was surprised and then angered 
by the fact that members of the indigenous tribes of our state, or any state, should pay for 
access to lands that were once their lands and that were stolen from them by colonizers. My 
calls to regional park managers only confirmed that they did not feel we should have free 
access. I could list the many egregious things that have been done to all of the indigenous 
peoples of this state and others, as well as Canada, but my time is better spent to tell you that
this would be one tiny step in healing the past wrongs against First Nations. Our people 
understand the delicate balance of our world and how we need to protect and understand the 
intricate spiritual and physical cycle of our planet.  We are the first stewards, and easing our 
access to these lands will only help to keep them better protected.  Thank you for your time.
