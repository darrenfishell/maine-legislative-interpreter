TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COl\/[MITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
CONSERVATION AND FORESTRY 
IN SUPPORT OF LD 25 
An Act to Provide Indigenous Peoples Free Access to State Parks 
January 25, 2023 
Senator Ingwerson, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Andy Cutko, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Parks and Lands. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (DACF) in support of LD 25, An Act to Provide Indigenous Peoples 
Free Access to State Parks. We thank Senator Hickman and his co-sponsors for submitting this 
bill. 
Maine State Parks and Historic Sites currently allow free day-use access to senior citizens, 
children under ﬁve, Maine veterans, gold star families, and military service members on active 
duty. Maine State Parks allow ﬂee camping to Maine Veterans who are 100% disabled. This 
bill would add free access to Maine State Parks and Historic Sites for members of federally 
recognized Indian nations, tribes, or bands. 
Since September 2020, DACF and the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands have participated in the 
First Light Journey, a collaboration between conservation groups, public agencies, and tribal 
representatives focused on expanding tribal access and stewardship of Maine lands. In 
conversations with other state and national park systems, I’ve learned that similar initiatives are 
occurring across the country. In the last legislative session, the legislature took a step in this 
direction by allowing Wabanaki collections of traditional materials from the Bureau’s Ecological 
Reserves. 
As the legislature considers this bill, I encourage the Committee to Weigh a few factors: 
0 First, as is the case with others who have free State Park access, an efﬁcient implementation 
will require a form of standardized identification so that entrance booth attendants and staff 
who handle campground reservations can verify that individuals are part of federally 
recognized tribes.

v Second, because fees from State Parks accrue into the state’s General Fund, this bill will 
have a ﬁscal impact. If We assume tribal members currently use State Parks at the same rate 
as Maine’s population on the whole, We approximate the ﬁscal impact at 0.6% of overall 
State Park revenue, or $39,344. We do not see this impact as being exorbitant, particularly 
in comparison with the beneﬁt to members of federally recognized Indian nations, tribes, or 
bands. 
0 Third, whether the bill intends to allow free day use and camping or just free day use is 
unclear. The ﬁscal note above is calculated to assume that camping is included. 
Thank you for your time. I would happily answer any questions now or at the work session.
