5th/6th Grade Class The Bay School
Blue Hill
LD 1839
Good afternoon, Senator Brennor, Representative Gramlich, and members of the 
Environment and Natural Resources Committee.
We are here to testify in support of LD 1839. We are a group of students at the Bay 
School, ages 11-13, in Blue Hill, ME. 
We started an environmental group out of our love of our natural world and the 
importance of our future. 
We decided to write to our government officials. We wrote about the climate crisis 
and what we need to do to help. Many did reply and we recently met with 
Representative Milliken.
 
We are here in support of Representative Milliken’s bill, LD 1839, because it seeks to
require the need for state-wide permitting for non- residential structures over 700 ft. 
in height. We are concerned about the effects of excessively tall buildings on Maine’s 
wildlife and the surrounding human communities. 
The amount of resources required to build these structures is enormous. 
We think those could be put to better use. According to “ScienceDirect” (which is a 
leading source of scientific and medical resources), the effects of building and 
maintaining tall structures create around 11% of measurable climate change. They 
also reduce citizen’s access to sunlight and clean air. 
The construction industry generates 170 tons of debris annually. Tall buildings create 
small microclimates that negatively impact the air surrounding us. They also use an 
incredible amount of labor which could be put to better use to help our environment 
heal.
Supporting this bill is one practical thing toward larger concerns we think you should 
do. Do you want us, the children of Maine, your children and their children to live in 
the crumbling ashes of our world's remains?
This concludes our testimony. Please vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 1839. We would be
happy to answer any questions. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Our Future Matters.
