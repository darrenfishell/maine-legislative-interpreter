Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Rob 
Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources at the Department of Environmental 
Protection, speaking in opposition to L.D. 1839. 
The creation of a working group as proposed by L.D. 1839 would fall to the Bureau of 
Land Resources. As we have mentioned previously before this Committee in recent

L.D. 1839: An Act to Study a Permitting Process for and Establish a Moratorium on Certain Tali Structures 
Testimony of: Rob Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources, DEP 
Public Hearing: May 8, 2023

weeks, the Land Bureau is presently understaffed and challenged to keep pace with our 
core responsibilities of permit application processing and compliance and enforcement. 
We appreciate that L.D. 1839 would provide flexibility to the Department to determine 
how to best form and carry out the duties of the proposed working group, but the 
coordination and stewardship of the working group would still require substantial staff 
time and resources. 
in addition, the Department notes that the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA) 
and the Site Location of Development Act (Site Law) contain robust standards that 
apply to tall structures when such structures trigger either law, or when they are part of 
activities or development that trigger these laws. For example, NRPA requires that an 
“activity will not unreasonably interfere with existing scenic, aesthetic, recreational or 
navigational uses," and Site Law requires the Department to find that, “The developer 
has made adequate provision for fitting the development harmoniously into the existing 
natural environment. ” Most of the considerations listed in L.D. 1839 are covered by 
these standards and other NRPA and Site Law standards. it is also important to note 
that laws administered by other state and federal agencies address standards related to 
building safety and aerial hazards. 
For these reasons, we do not believe that a working group as proposed by this bill is 
necessary at this time. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
