RE: AGC Maine’s Comments on  LD 1839  “An Act to Study a Permitting Process for and Establish a  
Moratorium on Certain Tall Structures ” 
 
 Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich , and Distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Environment and Natural Resources  my name  is Matt  Marks,  I am a Principal and Cornerstone  
Government  Affairs  and sendin g this letter  on behalf  of my client  AGC  Maine.   
 
AGC  Maine  is a statewide  commercial construction  industry  association  representing contractors,  
suppliers,  and service  providers.  The association  consists of companies’  signatory  to union s, open  shop s, 
ESOPs,  and small businesses.   
 
AGC  recommends  the Commi ttee exempt  offshore  wind  components  from  this requirement.  According 
to data  currently  available,  the average  onshore  U.S. Turbine  is 466 feet, the tallest  onshore  U.S. Turbine  
is 574 feet, the Block  Island  Offshore  Wind  Project  is 590 feet. But in Rotterdam,  Netherlands  the GE 
Haliade -X Offshore  Turbine  is 853 feet. Technology  continues  to advance,  and the sizes  of structures  
have  increased  to improve  generation  and performance.   
 
As Maine  continues  exploration  and development  of offshore  wind  it’s possible  that projects  could  be 
limited  under  this moratorium.  It might  be useful  to simply  exempt  energy  generation  facilities  from  this 
requirement.   
 
Thank  you,
