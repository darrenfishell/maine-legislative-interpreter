Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Transportation Committee members, 
I support eliminating the front license plate requirement, similar to many other states. 
It is a nuisance and stress for Mainers to the same extent that it is claimed to be a 
benefit. Please support LD736.
Thank you,
Dan
