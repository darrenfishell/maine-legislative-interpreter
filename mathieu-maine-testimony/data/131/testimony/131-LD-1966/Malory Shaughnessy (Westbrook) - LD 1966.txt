Testimony in Support of LD 1966  
An Act to Allow Candidates for County Office to  
Participate in the Maine  Clean Election Act  
Sponsored by Rep. Benjamin Collings  
 
Good Morning Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and esteemed members of the C ommittee on 
Legal and Veteran ’s Affairs. My name is Malory Shaughnessy and I am a resident of Westbrook. I am 
also a former C ounty Commiss ioner for Cumberl and County.  
 
I am here today in support of LD 1966, An Act to Allow Candidates for County Of fice to Participate in 
the Maine Clean Election Act . I wan t to thank Rep. Collings for sponsoring this bill, and Rep. Rielly for 
co-sponsoring. This bill would extend our well-respected  citizen financing system to county candidates .  
 
The fundamental premise of clean elections is to level the playing field of electoral politics,  and to 
create a system of small donor public financing. Small donor public financing enables more candidates 
from diverse backgrounds to run and it amplifies the voices of regular people.  It incentivizes candidates 
to seek out many  supporters  and garner grass roots support , not seek just a few big donors. This is a  
system that can effectiv ely reduc e the problem of big money in politics  and the outsize influence of a 
few wealthy donors or corporations which might have specific agendas  for those elected . 
 
This should hold true for all key elected positions.  
 
Why do we care about the possible outsize influence of a few large dono rs on legislators but not the 
potential influence  on S heriffs or District Attorneys, or  for that matter, C ounty Commissioners  and 
Probate Judges ? Sheriffs and District Attorneys  uphold and prosecute the laws that legislators enact. 
Commissioners are the counties' chief electe d officials, and are ultimately responsible for the fiscal 
operations and policy decisions affecting county government , which includes our system of jails . 
Probate Judges determine  matters relating t o the administration of the estates of deceased persons , 
and settle parental  rights dis putes . These are important positions with wide reaching impacts on  
individuals and communities across ou r state.  
 
I am not impugning  the integrity of candidates that seek private financing . I sought and received 
private funding for my campaigns for County C ommission er. I know many fine  legislators and county 
officials  that have been privately funded. There is no direct correlation of influence peddling or 
corruption with private fina ncing of elections, but there is the potential .  
 
There is the basic  fact that as anyone who studies  American po litics recognizes, very  few can succeed 
without significant financial support . Those  who can offer that support are therefore enormously  
influential , and have far more access to candi dates and offic ials.  
 
In order to level the playing field for all candidates, and preserve the integrity of our elections, w e 
should  expand our clean elections system to incorporate county offic ials. Thank you for hearing my 
concerns . Plea se vote  Ought to Pass on this legislation.
