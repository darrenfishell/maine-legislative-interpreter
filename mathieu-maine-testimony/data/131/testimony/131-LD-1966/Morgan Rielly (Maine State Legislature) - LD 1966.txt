Testimony of Representative Morgan Rielly in support of 
LD 1966, “An Act to Allow Candidates for County Ofﬁce to Participate in the Maine Clean 
Election Act” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Good moming Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and fellow members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. I am Morgan Rielly, and I represent House 
District 127, which includes part of Westbrook. Thank you for the opportunity to provide 
testimony in support of LD 1966, “An Act to Allow Candidates for County Ofﬁce to 
Participate in the Maine Clean Election Act” for your consideration. 
As we have seen with recent elections, there has been a ﬂood of monies into county-Wide races. 
Amending the Maine Clean Election Act to include candidates for county-wide ofﬁce will help 
tamp down on outside monies being poured into these races by special interest groups and 
wealthy individuals. This change will encourage candidates to participate in county-wide races 
who don’t have the means to rely on personal wealth and connections. 
We already allow state legislators, including a state senate seat that includes an entire county, and 
the Govemor to participate in clean elections. Letting candidates for county ofﬁce participate as 
clean election candidates makes sense. 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. 
District 127: Westbrook
