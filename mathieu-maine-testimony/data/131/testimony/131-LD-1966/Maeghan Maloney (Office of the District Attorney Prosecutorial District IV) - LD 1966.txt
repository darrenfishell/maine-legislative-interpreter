First Assistant District Attorney 
STATE OF MAINE 
OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
PROSECUTORIAL DISTRICT IV 
May 24, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Honorable members of the 
Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, my name is Maeghan Maloney, I am the 
District Attorney for Kennebec and Somerset Counties and the President of the Maine 
Prosecutors Association. I am here today in support of LD 1966, An Act to Allow 
Candidates for County Office to Participate in the Maine Clean Election Act. 
I first ran for office as a clean election candidate for the Maine legislature. 
Consequently, my campaign was focused on hearing the concerns of the people of my 
district and meeting as many of them as possible. - 
I then ran for district attorney for two Maine counties and had to raise money 
traditionally. Raising money unfortunately took the majority of my time. Who donates 
to a district attorney race? Attorneys who might have business with the District 
Attorney's Office. That invariably creates a potential future conﬂict. It would be 
similar to candidates for the legislature raising money primarily from lobbyists —one 
of the reasons the clean election statute was passed. District attorneys have exclusive 
authority over whether to charge most criminal cases in Maine, whether to offera 
plea to resolve the case, whether to drop a felony to a misdemeanor and what crimes 
will be given the focus of the office. The decisions of district attorneys change people’s 
lives every day. It is important that district attorneys do not have a bias towarda 
party either actual or perceived.' 
I am grateful to Representatives Collins and Rielly for bringing forward this 
legislation. Thank you. 
I urge you to vote in favor of LD 1966. 
Thank you for your consideration, 
/s/ Maeghan Maloney
