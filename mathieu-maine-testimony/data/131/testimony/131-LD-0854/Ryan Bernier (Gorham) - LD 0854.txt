Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and Honorable Members of the Taxation 
Committee: 
My name is Ryan Bernier. I grew up in Presque Isle. I attended the University of 
Maine and graduated with a Bachelor ’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. After 
graduation, I moved to Gorham to start a job with Poland Spring, where I have 
been working for the past 6 years. I started as a Maintenance Supervisor, then 
transitioned to an Engineering Manager. I currently serye as an Operations 
Manager for Poland Spring. 
Many of my friends were forced to move outside of Maine after graduation to ﬁnd 
good paying jobs. I consider myself very fortunate to have found one right here in 
Maine with Poland Spring. At Poland Spring, we earn a good wage, have a good 
retirement plan, and receive competitive health beneﬁts. The tax proposed in LD 
854 would put these jobs in jeopardy. We need more jobs like this in Maine, not 
fewer. 
Poland Spring has been operating a sustainable business in Maine for 175 years. 
Additionally, the tax proposed in LD 854 would hurt the communities around us 
that we support. We help when there are disasters, we help schools, we provide 
business to truckers, business owners, and others. 
This job has provided me with endless growth opportunities. The company has 
treated me and all its employees with care and respect. I urge this committee to 
vote No on LD 854. 
Thank you, 
Ryan Bernier
