LD 854, An Act to Fund the Protection and Restoration of Riparian and Estuarine 
Ecosystems and to Impose an Excise Tax on Certain Bottled Water Operators
My name is Stanley Tetenman.  I am a resident of Poland and a selectperson. I am 
opposed to LD 854.  This testimony is given as an individual and not as a 
representative of the selectboard or Town.
The proposed legislation is aimed towards one company in the state, Poland Spring 
Bottling.  The company is the largest property taxpayer in Poland.  It has about 900 
employees through out the state.  It is one of the least polluting major employers in 
Maine.
Its employees are some of the best paid in Maine.  They also have one of the best 
benefit packages in the state.
Ground water is a renewable resource.  Less than 1% of the ground water in Maine is 
extracted by Poland Spring Bottling.  The company has on staff geologists, 
hydrogeologists and engineers to ensure the amount of water extracted is sustainable 
to keep the aquafers viable. The company has to make sure it is extracting in a 
responsible manner otherwise it will not have a product to sell. 
The company pays combined taxes to the state more than $7 million per year.  In 
addition, its employees pay income, sales, and property taxes.  The company is 
extremely generous not just to the Town of Poland but to many other communities 
and charities in the state. Since 2010 it has donated more than $10 million to various 
charities. 
No other state taxes extracted water.  A 2022 Maine Water Study that was approved 
by the legislature  did not recommend a water extraction tax.
The implementation of this tax will endanger future expansion of the company in 
Maine.  It may also jeopardize current operations in the state.
I urge you to vote ought not to pass.
Thank you.
