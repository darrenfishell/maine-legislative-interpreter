Dear Taxation Committee, 
I am a resident of Poland. I have lived here for 55 year, next door to the Poland 
Spring Water Bottling Plant. There impact on our small town is huge. They provide 
hiking to trails to all, a free museum for children to visit, free water to those in need 
and so much more. They probably offer the best manufacture job of any business in 
the state with the best benefits.  Because of there generosity  to our community and 
other communities children have food on the table, school kids get to visit the ecology
school, and other trips that they would not be able to afford. Much of this could go 
away if they are taxed at the manufacturing level. As we as consumer already pay 
sales taxes on water when we buy at the store. 
Please reconsider this tax. Thank you, Cynthia Robbins, Innkeeper Poland Spring 
Resort
