LD 1583: An Act to Provide a Pathway to Sobriety for Formerly or Currently Incarcerated Individuals.  
Testimony of David Packhem, Executive Director of Students Empowered to End Dependency, SEED 
April 25, 2023 
 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety:  My name is David Packhem and I am the Executive Director of 
Students Empowered to End Dependency, SEED, and the Executive Producer of the documentary series 
airing on Maine Public, called “Voices of Hope…The Rugged Road to Recovery.”  I am here today to 
testify against LD 1583. 
I am not a medical expert but I am a researcher and a documentarian.  In regard to LD 1583, I simply 
offer you the following published research. 
 
First: The number one risk factor for adolescent opioid misuse is ever having used marijuana.

Second:   The predominant predictor of adult opioid misuse is having used marijuana before 18.  
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31962227/  
Third: Cannabis Use increases the risk of developing Opioid Use Disorder. 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28946762/  
Fourth: Instead of supporting the marijuana protection hypothesis ecologic associations at the 
national level suggest that marijuana legalization has contributed to the US’s opioid epidemic. 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35469600/  
Fifth: Legal medical marijuana, particularly when available through retail dispensaries as it is in 
Maine is associated with higher opioid mortality.

Sixth: Meta-analysis of 20 studies:  Cannabis is no better than a placebo for pain management.

Seventh:  Drivers testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test positive for opioids.

In my last 5 years of study to produce the documentary series, I have concluded that medical marijuana, 
as it is constituted in Maine is a dangerous hoax.  If you watch episodes 7 and 8 of the documentary 
series, you will meet the Maine and Colorado experts who agree with that statement.  If Maine 
continues its unregulated path promoting the use of today’s high dose marijuana, known as “skunk” in 
the United Kindom, we will continue to see increases in overdoses and lose a generation of young 
people, 66% of whom have bought the lie that marijuana is safe to use.  
As part of my testimony, I have provided a link to episodes 7 and 8:  https://seedmaine.org/  
Also, I provide a short 14-minute video that we show to schools and community forums:

I would also refer you to this month’s RX and Drug Summit: “Cannabis: Responding to the Evolving 
Landscape.”  Gordon Smith has the slides from: 
Brook Hoots, PhD, MSPH, Cannabis Study Unit Head Division of Overdose Prevention at the CDC 
Richard Holdman, MD, MPH, Colorado Department of Public Health 
Kenneth Finn, MD, Co-Vice President, International Academy on the Science and Impacts of Cannabis 
 
Thank you.
