Box 17642 Portland, ME 04112-8642 (207) 523-9869      mainemacdl@gmail.com  April 25, 2023   Senator Pinny Beebe-Center, Chair Representative Suzanne Salisbury, Chair Committee on Criminal Justice & Public Safety 100 State House Station, Room 436 Augusta, ME 04333   RE: LD 1583: An Act to Provide a Pathway to Sobriety for Formerly or Currently Incarcerated Individuals   Dear Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and Members of the Committee on Criminal Justice and Public:   MACDL submits this testimony in opposition to LD 1583.  This bill seems to be premised on the false assumption that if one is using medically assisted treatment to maintain sobriety, i.e. using prescribed Suboxone to assist with opioid use disorder, they are not truly “sober.” That is not what is standard in the medical or recovery communities and unduly stigmatizes and punishes those who are receiving such treatment: a person could only receive housing support in a recovery residence if they are completely “substance” free. That does not seem like an effective way to allocate resources.  Additionally, this bill would apply to anyone released from custody of the DOC—including those who are not on probation. The stringent testing requirements would not be enforceable for anyone not on probation. The tenor of this bill is that its proclamations would be mandatory, rather than optional, which also raises a host of issues.  This proposal also—without scientific basis that is apparent—promotes the use of cannabis or other “alternative” herbal medicines to treat substance use disorder, including alcohol dependency. While Suboxone, methadone, and other prescription medication have been studied for their efficacy in helping treat substance use disorder, these “alternative” treatments have not (at least not to my knowledge in any scientifically verified study).   The bill arbitrarily imposes a hard 30 percent floor for the number of people requiring no medically assisted treatment or that program’s contract shall be cancelled. This is a strange and unforgiving provision of the bill.  I know in colloquial parlance, “getting clean and staying clean” may seem like an absolute that any substance use would taint. That is simply not the reality of people working on recovery. Too often I see legislators, judges, and others without scientific knowledge or expertise make medical decisions for other people that are based on thoughts and feelings—as opposed to data and research. This should not be one of those times.  Thank you for your consideration, for your attention to this matter, and for allowing me to share with you all today on this important issue.                    Sincerely,                                                                     /s/ Tina Heather Nadeau, Esq.                               MACDL Executive Director
