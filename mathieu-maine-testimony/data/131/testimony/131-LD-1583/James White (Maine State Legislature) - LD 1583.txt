LD 1583 April Z5, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Beebe-Center and Representative Salisbury and 
distinguished members of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee. 
The medical assisted treatment program in our jails is a prime example of 
good intentions gone wrong. Currently the program is not held to any 
standards and has been monopolized by the same organizations that make 
all of the decisions about the implementation of the program. This is not 
good. Aprovider from the same organization that sells the Suboxone 
makes the determination that it is necessary in the first place. In most 
cases the drugs being prescribed are bought from the same company and 
administered by them as well. That sounds off at face value but when you 
look closer it gets worse. They have no plan to wean people off of the 
suboxone. As a matter of fact it is just the opposite. They are expected 
to stay on it for the rest of their lives. Sentencing someone to a life of 
addiction when it isn’t necessary is cruel and inhumane. There are 
currently other doctors and other alternatives being used to treat 
addiction successfully and by success l present to you that being 
substance free is the only standard thatwe should be using. You will be 
hearing testimony today from some of those people. 
The goal of this bill is to bring hope in the darkness and as the title says 
provide a pathway to sobriety. I 
‘ believe this can be accomplished by the 
two goals I laid out in the bill. l‘t’s truly quite simple offering competition 
as you see here the monopoly of the current medical providers would be 
challenged by allowing alternative treatments that have proved 
extremely successful in other venues. One of those treatments is cannabis 
oil. The second is setting a standard; itis written in the bill that 
providers must show 30% of their patients being substance free after6 
months and at inten/als laid out in the bill. 
Thank you for your consideration,H 
Representative James White'
