Re: LD  770– An Act to Prohibit  Ballot  Harvesting  by Preventing  a 3rd Person  from 
Returning  More than 2 Absentee  Ballots  Per Day
Position: Opposed
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is in opposition to LD 770 and we thank you for 
the opportunity to outline our points for your Committee.
Members expressed concern about the ability to track outstanding 3rd party ballots, since up 
to 5 absentee ballots can be in a 3rd person’s possession at one time, and they are required 
to return them within two days.  The prohibition to return two or less completed absentee 
ballots per day would result in voted and/or unvoted ballots being held by the 3rd person.  
Of course, this holding period increases the possibility of ballots being lost or forgotten and 
could disenfranchise those voters.
The proposed language doesn’t specify whether only two absentee ballots can be returned 
by municipality or in the entire state.  It is assumed that this would be limited by 
municipality, but if not, it would be impossible to track at the state level since municipalities 
only have access to their own absentee ballot data.  One town would have no way to know 
if a 3rd person had already returned two absentee ballots to another municipality.
Concerns were raised regarding nursing home and elderly housing facilities, where staff 
members often are designated as a 3rd party carrier when clerks are unable to conduct in 
person absentee voting at those facilities.  The impact to these voters could disenfranchise 
them and make an already cumbersome process even more complicated.
Since the rollout of online absentee ballot requests and absentee ballot return drop boxes, 
fewer voters opt to use a 3rd person to carry their ballots.  Clerks agree that very few 
ballots are issued and returned using a 3rd person.

MunicipalitiesAlthough we acknowledge the importance of enhancing security to prevent ballot 
harvesting, we feel that this bill does not result in the desired outcome since very few 
ballots are actually issued and returned by this method.
