In Opposition to  
LD 770, An Act to Prohibit Ballot Harvesting by Preventing a 3rd Person from Returning More 
than 2 Absentee Ballots per Day  
 
March 13, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 770 
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Election officials work tireless ly to ensure Maine elections are conducted in a secure and 
fair manner and that all eligible citizens votes are counted. Current law states that a third -party 
must return a collected absentee ballot within 48 hours with the limit of ballots set at 5. The proposed bill would reduce the number of absentee ballots that can be returned by a third party, 
which opens the door for ballots to be held and potentially forgotten about, ultimately disenfranchising those  voter s. Furthermore, voters who reside in nursing ho mes or elderly 
housing facilities, where typically a staff member is designated as the third -party carrier when 
clerks are unable to conduct in person absentee voting, are additionally disenfranchised.  
The LPC supports the Maine town and city clerks and urge you to vote ought not to pass 
on LD  770. T hank you for  your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
