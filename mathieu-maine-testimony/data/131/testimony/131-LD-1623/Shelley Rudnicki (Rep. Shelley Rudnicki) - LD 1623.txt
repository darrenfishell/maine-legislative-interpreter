Testimony  
In Support of 
 
LD 1623 An Act to Prohibit All State Subsidies for Electric Vehicles 
 
Senator Mark Lawrence,  Representative S. Paige Zeigler and members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology, I am 
Shelley Rudnicki, representing District #67 Fairfield and Benton and I am 
here to present LD 1623 “An Act to Prohibit All State Subsidies for 
Electric Vehicles”. 
 
Why should the People of The State of Maine subsidize with credits, grants 
and rebates, people with the means to buy an electric vehicle? Electric 
vehicles cost more than gas powered vehicles.  Electric vehicle owners may 
not pay much or any gas tax to help with the maintenance of our 
roads.   EVs are far heavier than traditional gas-powered cars due to their 
large battery packs. “The weight of these vehicles, and the weight of these 
battery packs in these vehicles, is quite significant,” said Raul Arbelaez of 
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, April 12, 2023. 
 
Most Maine people cannot afford or do not want to purchase an electric 
vehicle.  Again, I ask why should they subsidize those who chose to 
buy electric vehicles?
