LD 1623
LD 1623 ought-NOT-to pass as this bill is tantamount to coercion by the government 
using my taxes to promote a view that other mainers do not support. This is especially
true for supporting an energy source which is NOT renewable, creates destruction of 
land by digging up 500,000 lbs of earth to harvest minerals for one car battery.  Then 
the batteries still need to be charged by fossel fuel generators.
Thank you.
