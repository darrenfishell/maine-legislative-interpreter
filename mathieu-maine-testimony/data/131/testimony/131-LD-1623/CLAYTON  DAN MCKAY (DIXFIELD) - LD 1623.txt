Why are Maine ratepayers subsidizing natural gas plant generation shifted from a 
plant in Massachusetts to a plant in Maine?
What we know is Calpine Corporation owns natural gas-fired electric plants in Maine 
and Massachusetts.
We also know, thanks to the data collected by the Energy Information Agency (EIA), 
that Calpine's Massachusetts plant Produced 1,271,039 LESS megawatt hours of 
electricity in 2022 than 2019
We also know from EIA data that Calpine's plant in Maine produced 1,504,664 
MORE megawatt hours of electricity in the same time span.
Why the shift?
Massachusetts uses way more electricity than Maine. As a matter of fact, Maine 
doesn't need the extra production from Calpine's Maine plant. So, where does this 
extra electricity end up?
Some more known facts.........
Maine and Massachusetts are enrolled in RGGI (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative).
RGGI tracks carbon emissions from electric plants and applies a carbon tax per ton of 
C02 emissions paid by emitting plants.
Maine and Massachusetts have individual caps on the amount of C02 emissions 
allowed from electric generation plants within their state.
We know Massachusetts is approaching its cap and could shed some emissions 
without incurring any increased costs or loss of electricity by sending the resource 
creating the C02 emissions to another state as long as this other state doesn't exceed 
their own carbon cap with this imported natural gas.
Because this extra generation from natural gas is produced in the state of Maine but 
not necessarily consumed in Maine, Maine ratepayers, nevertheless. subsidize this 
extra natural gas output at a tune of $6,831,176  in RGGI costs.
RGGI carbon costs are applied to in-state generation, not the actual generation 
purchased by suppliers that leads to in-state retail sales.
