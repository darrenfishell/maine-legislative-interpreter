LD 1838
An Act to Create the Empowerment Scholarship Account Program
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield, and I am here in opposition of LD 1838. 
This bill would establish a program to give participating students state funding to be used to pay 
expenses for private school.
The fact is that it's not the government's job to pay for the education of children. It is the parents who 
are supposed to be in charge of their children's education.  
So even though it wrong for parents of private schoolers to have to pay taxes to fund public schoolers' 
education while receiving nothing themselves  -- two wrongs don't make a right .  
If government funding for education is wrong, it's wrong across the board.  The solution is not to 
subsidize all students.  The solution is to get the government out of education and let families keep 
their hard-earned money so they can better afford to pay for their own children's education expenses.
It is for this reason that I ask you to oppose LD 1838.  Thank you.
