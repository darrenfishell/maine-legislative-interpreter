Private school vouchers can take many forms, but they all are designed to fund private schools with public 
dollars. Public schools serve all students, regardless of economic status, disability, religion, race, ethnicity, 
English ﬂuency, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, family status, or any other personal 
characteristic. Unlike private schools, which can pick and choose their students and oﬁen cater only to those 
who can afford tuition, public schools open their doors to all, free of charge. 
Private school vouchers do not offer real choice. Vouchers give a choice to private schools, rather than parents 
and students. Voucher programs allow private schools to accept taxpayer dollars but still reject students with 
vouchers for a variety of reasons, ranging from disability to ability to pay. And even with vouchers, most 
parents still camiot afford the full cost of attending a private school or provide the transportation needed to get 
to the private school. In Maine, the average tuition for a private elementary school is $15,000 and up to 
$30,000 for tuition for a private high school. Therefore, low-income families are not fairly and equitably 
served by a voucher program as they can’t afford the additional costs and fees that are associated with private 
schools. 
Private voucher schools do not adequately serve students with disabilities, often failing to admit them or 
provide them the same quality and quantity of services available to students in public schools, including those 
mandated under each student’s individualized education program (IEP).

Private school voucher programs talk about parent empowerment but have little to say about providing parents 
safeguards against fraud and incompetence. Nor are there protections in place for students whose parents fail 
to exercise good judgment. 
Maine students deserve to attend schools that have highly qualiﬁed teachers where students of all 
backgrounds are accepted and appreciated. It is for these reasons that our associations oppose L.D. 1860, 
1741, 1798,1841, and 1838.
