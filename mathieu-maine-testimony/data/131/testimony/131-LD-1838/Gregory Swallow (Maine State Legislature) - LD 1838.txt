LD 1838 - An Act to Create the Empowerment Scholarship Account Program 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, lam Representative Gregory Swallow from House District 7 representing Houlton, Linne us, 
Ludlow, New Limerick and Oakfield. l am here today to introduce LD 1838. This bill allows education 
dollars to follow the child and in its truest sense is a voucher bill. It allows 50% of the per pupil average 
expenditures spent on traditional public school students in the prior school year to be used toward 
tuition and fees at a private school. 
In the report, The Learning State: Maine Schooling for the 21st Century — Executive Summary states: 
”Maine’s schools are not ready for the 21st century. ” In order for Maine to flourish it states dramatic 
change must occur in Maine's schools. (p.6) Maine has one of the most expensive public school systems 
in the nation and yet our results measured by multiple indices are flat through recent years. (p.8) The 
report then goes on to recommend expanding the current opportunities for school choice. What has 
the legislative response been to expanding school choice? Greater school consolidation. 
School choice in different forms has continued to grow across the United States as the U. S. public 
education system falters and parents feel more removed from involvement in theirchildren's education. 
The school choice movement primarily includes charter schools and private schools both sectarian and 
non-sectarian. Non-Public schools have grown much faster in recent decades than have the public 
schools with a disproportionate share of charter school students being Hispanic (33%) and Black (26%) 
for very basic reasons. At the same time, U.S. K-12 public school education has grown exponentially in 
costs in the past few decades without producing corresponding results. 
l would like to review some common issues regarding American public education and school choice. 
What are the comparative per pupil public school costs in the U.S. and internationally_? _ 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the statistical division of the U. S. 
Department of Education, American public schools spent $14,761 per pupil in the 2018-19 school year as 
measured in constant inflation adjusted 2020-21 dollars. Exhibit A 
The cost of per pupil public school expenditures has increased substantially in real dollars over the past 
several years. Between the 1969-1970 and 2018- 2019 school years per pupil expenditures in public 
elementary and high schools increased in constant 2019-2020 inflation adjusted dollars from $5,684.00 
to $14,716. This is a 159% increase afteradjustingfor inflation. As an aside, the Cato Institute estimated 
that all the public school expenditures are not being reported and the public schools they reviewed 
were under reportingthe costs due to exclusion of capital expenditures and various otherexpenditures. 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, NCES, the current per pupil expenditure for 
grades K-12 for Maine students in the 2018-2019 school year was $18,099 in constant 2020-2021 
inflation adjusted dollars, 12"‘ highest state in the nation. The comparable current national average per 
pupil expenditure was, as mentioned above, $14,761. Exhibit A
The cost of public schools nationally, when compared to the non-prestigious private schools, is 
significant with average private school tuition running at a fraction of the per pupil cost of public 
schools. In 2021, sectarian private schools had an average per pupil tuition of $8,670 compared to 
public school per pupil costs of $15,205. Nationally, charter schools‘ average expenditures per pupil are 
28%+/- less than public schools. The most recent NAEP (National Assessment of Education Progress) 
found that private school students consistently outperform their public-school peers in almost all 
subjects; furthermore, on SAT's private school students prevail over public school students in all 
subjects. Exhibit H Page2 
When U. S. per pupil spending is compared with other countries, the U. S over recent years has generally 
placed between second (2) and fifth (5) in per pupil expenditures when compared with OECD 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and other nations. The most recent 
comparison shows the U. S. spent more per pupil than all countries except Austria, Luxembourg, Norway 
and Iceland. All much smaller countries. Incidentally, in 2018 the average per pupil expenditure for 
OECD nations was $10,800 compared to the U. S. with $14,400. Exhibits C andD 
For all that the U. S. spends on our public education system, what are the results? 
PISA Tests 
The best comparison between U. S. students and those of other countries for educational outcomes is 
the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests. PISA testing is performed every three 
years and tests students for proficiency in reading, math and science. It tests competency in these 
subject areas between 15-year-olds from OECD nations and other countries. Below are the results of 
PISA testing for the years 2009, 2012 and 2018. Exhibit I 
Subject U. S. 
Year 2018/2012/Z009

2018/ 2012/2009 
13/24/17 
35/36/18 
18/25/13 
These test results have been trending slightly to the downside in recent years. Considering U. S. per 
pupil expenditures compared with other nations, the results are extremely disappointing. Overall 
averages are brought down by more underdeveloped countries. In the 2018 PISA reading test the U. S. 
ranked 13"‘ overall and those results were considered not measurably different than 10 other countries. 
Compared to only the 35 OECD countries rather than all participants, U. S. students placed 9th in 
reading proficiency. In math, U. S. Students ranked 35“ overall and only 31“ out of the 37 OECD 
countries. The U. S. was above average in science; however, we ranked only 13"‘ out of 37 OECD 
countries. Exhibit I
NAEP Tests Recent Comparative 
The National Association of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests further illustrate a proficiency divide in 
math and reading between public school and private school students. The chart below shows the 2022 
results between public, charter and private Catholic schools in math and reading at three grade levels. 
Many charter schools are set up for special needs which affects their score. Later in this testimony it will 
show apples to apples comparisons between charter and public schools. Exhibit K 
Grade Public (Math/Reading) Charter (Math/Reading) Private Catholic (Math/Reading) 
Four 235/216 232/214 246/233 
Eighth 273/259 286/257 288/279 
Twelve 149/284 138/275 N/A 
On a nationwide basis white and Asian students comprise a majority of students in public schools, at the 
same time black and Hispanic students make up the majority of students in charter schools and are 
often located in low-income minority neighborhoods. 
NAEP Tests Maine & Nationally 
The National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests students for grade level proficiency in math 
and reading. Below is a chart outlining the results for the NAEP's 2019 Nations Report Card. 
Grade Reading Proficiency (Maine/National Score) Math Proficiency (Maine/National Score) 
Year 2019 2002 1992 2019 2003 1990 
Four 36% (221/219) (225/217) ( /217) 42% (241/240) (238/234) ( /213) 
Eight 36% (265/263) (270/263) ( /260) 34% (282/281) (282/276) ( /263) 
Twelve 37% (N/A/285) (N/A/287) ( /292) 24% (N/A/150) (N/A/150) ( /150) 
The Nations Report Card confirms that approximately 1/3 of l\/laine students are at grade level 
proficiency in either reading or math. Furthermore, reading scores for grade levels 4 & 8 are below 
those in 1998 with little change in math scores as well. lt’s imperative to consider that l\/laine is well 
above the national average in per pupil expenditures, has a low student teacher ratio and is relieved 
from dealing with the issues of large urban schools. Finally, it is my understanding that between 1986 
and 2006 Maine's per pupil K-12 education expenditures were the fastest growing of any U.S. state ona 
percentage basis. Exhibit K, Exhibit L 
SAT Tests 
SAT scores for all U. S. students can be compared historically. The scores have been generally declining 
over time. NCES table 226.20 shows SAT scores have dropped from 1045 in 1971 (reading 532 — math 
513) to 1006 (reading 495 — math 511) in 2015.
ln 2021, the average private school SAT score was 1227. ln that same year, the average SAT score for all 
students was 1061 (reading 533 — math 528); however, it has become more difficult to compare 
historical SAT scores since 2016 when significant changes were made. Exhibit] (1) & J (2) 
The 1983 report ”A Nation at Risk" noted that average verbal SAT scores plummeted "over 50 points" 
and the mathematics SAT scores fell "nearly 40 points" between 1963—1980. We have not been moving 
up since that report. NAEP testing did not begin until 1990. 
NAIS Tests 
ln a 2014-2015 study published by the National Association of independent Schools (NAIS)a 
comparative analysis illustrates the contrast between the public school and private school students with 
SAT scores in reading and math.

Exhibit (O) 
The primary study performed to date between private charter and public schools is chronicled in Dr. 
Thomas Sowell’s book, Charter Schools and Their Enemies, copyright 2020. In this 2017-2018 study, 
very specific parameters are established to ensure that the results are based upon true empirical 
analysis and to remove subjectivity. This study is limited to public and charter schools in New York City 
only. The following is a list of criteria established by Dr. Sowell to maintain the principle of impartiality 
and abolish any "cherry picking" and maintain objectivity in comparing charter and public schools. 
0 There is a similar ethnic composition of students from the charter school and the traditional 
public school being compared and the schools must serve the same local population. 
0 The students in both schools are taught in the very same building. This assists in reducing any 
dispersions due to location of homes and socioeconomic backgrounds. 
v The traditional public school and the charter school have one or more classes in the same 
building at the same grade level for test comparison purposes. 
~ The students are selected by lottery 
Particular detailed study was given to five of the largest charter schools in New York City with 
networks of multiple schools with students in five or more building that are shared with 
traditional public schools and having students at the same grade level. Also, the schools that 
are compared in this sample must have a majority of students who are either black and/or 
Hispanic. Exhibit N
In the end, the study concentrated on five charter school networks that met the above requirements; 
however, results from smaller charter school are also included in the results. lt's important to note that 
these students are from the same neighborhood, have the same ethnic and socio-economic 
backgrounds and are selected by lottery only. The two tests utilized are given annually by the New York 
State Education Department and basically deal with reading/english and math comprehension. 
The study allows for comparing charter schools among one another as well as public schools. The results 
show widely contrasting differences between charter schools and public schools with particular charter 
schools exhibiting astoundingly different outcomes and consistently so.

Of the 65 charter schools in New York City that were in the same building as the public schools there 
were 172 grade levels tested in English Language Arts. The majority of charter school students scored 
proficient or above in 65% of those grade levels. The public school students only had a majority of 
students scoring at or above proficiency in 14 percent of those grade levels with 191 grade levels tested.

On the New York State math test 68% of the charter schools with 161 grade levels tested had a majority 
of students testing at or above proficiency. The traditional public schools had 177 grade levels tested. 
Only 10% of the public schools had a majority of students scoring at or above proficient at those grade 
levels.

Again, these students are from the same neighborhood, have the same ethnic make-up, background and 
socio-economic status. Charter school students are selected by lottery with thousands not being picked 
and having to remain in public schools 
There have been studies performed by economists in regard to those students who entered the lottery 
but were not selected and remained in traditional public schools. One study, utilizing charter schools in 
Boston, was completed by Harvard economist Tom Kane. lt found those students who won the lottery 
and attended charter schools significantly outperformed those that lost the lottery and ended up 
attending public schools. 
What is most troublesome, considering this empirical analysis and other findings, is that Maine’s 129*“ 
Legislature voted to limit charter schools, at the then operating number of ten. We, in Maine, are now 
restricted by statute from opening more charter schools. Thankfully, private sectarian and non-sectarian 
schools remain operating in Maine and can still make a difference. 
ln that regard, the Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that sectarian schools cannot be excluded from state 
funding due to separation of church and state. In Zelman vs. Simmons-Harris the court ruled in favor of 
the parents in Cleveland, Ohio, over the ACLU allowing vouchers to follow the child to both sectarian 
and non-sectarian schools. However, Maine's Attorney General has been fighting that ruling, as yet to 
no avail, to stop funds from following the child to a sectarian school. 
ln June 2022, the Supreme Court again ruled in favor of allowing vouchers for religious based private 
schools in Carson vs. Makin. This case was filed by Maine's Attorney General using the argument that 
religious schools discriminate against LGBTQ+ people and others and therefore should not be allowed 
public funding.
Conclusion 
I have introduced and testified on school choice legislation in Maine since 2003 and before various 
legislative committees. The opposition's responses are always the same, "We just need a little more 
time and more money because we have a new plan" . ln 1997, that plan was The Maine Learning 
Results. How did that work out? Maine's response has been to limit charter schools and fight any 
funding for private sectarian schools. Review the results that been chronicled above. It seems to me boy 
that 100 +/- years and arguably the most expensive public education system in the world, among major 
countries, should quell those arguments. 
Maine's public education system is basically average in its educational outcomes when compared with 
other states, while strapped with well above average per pupil expenditures. We are also one small part 
of a country that has disappointing outcomes at exorbitant costs when compared with other nation's 
education systems. Sadly, the exponential growth in Maine's and the nation's public education expenses 
in recent decades has shown no corresponding outcomes. 
South Korea who has one of the best education systems in the world at a reasonable cost started using 
the American educational model several decades ago. The nation remained near the bottom in results; 
therefore, they dropped our model, started over with a new system and now have outstanding results. 
Questions 
Why does South Korea continually rank at the top in international testing with much lower per pupil 
expenditures and a higher student teacher ratio of 25 to 1 and 30 to 1P 
Why should a child's educational opportunities be dependent upon their zip code? 
Why are parents being ostracized from their child's education rather than being included? 
Why did not one child in 23 of Baltimore's public schools meet grade level proficiency in math in 2023? 
Why between 2001 & 2016 has enrollment in public schools risen 1% and charter schools risen 571%? 
This year marks the 40"‘ anniversary of the 1983 landmark report, commissioned by President Regan, ”A 
Nation at Risk: An imperative for Educational Reform" by the United States National Commission on 
Excellence in Education. The report asserted, in no uncertain terms, that American schools were failing. 
It went on to state, "the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising 
tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a People.../ ’ 
This bill puts families and children first.
Quotes from Thomas Sowell 
"Apparently almost anyone can do a better job of educating children than our so-called 
‘educators ’ in the public schools. Children who are home-schooled by their parents also 
score higher on tests than children educated in the public schools." 
"Successful education shows what is possible, whether in charter schools, private schools, 
military schools or home-schooling.” 
"Whenever people talk glibly of a need to achieve educational “excellence ” , I think of 
what an improvement it would be if our public schools could just achieve mediocrity." 
It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by 
putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.
