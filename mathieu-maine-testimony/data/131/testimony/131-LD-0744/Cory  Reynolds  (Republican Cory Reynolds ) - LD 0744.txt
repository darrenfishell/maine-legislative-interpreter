Republican Cory Reynolds 
LD 744
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyers, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Cory Reynolds and 
I urge you to pass LD 744, During the pandemic in 2020-2023 the individuals and 
staff has been trying their best to work hard on their goals and trying to keep staff has 
been a struggle to keep supporting the individualâ€™s needs. I thank the committee for 
their consideration and am glad to answer any questions from the committee.
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
