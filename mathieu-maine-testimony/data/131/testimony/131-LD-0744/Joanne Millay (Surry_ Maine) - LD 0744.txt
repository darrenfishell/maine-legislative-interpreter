Kindly pass this bill to support our care professionals and staff who work with 
persons who have developmental disabilities and autism.  This is challenging work 
and the current shortage of workers is keeping many persons, such as my daughter 
who is deaf-blind, from being able to participate in any day programs or community 
activities.  Thank you.
