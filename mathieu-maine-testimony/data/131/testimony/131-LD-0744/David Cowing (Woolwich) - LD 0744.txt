LD 744
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: 
My name is David Cowing, and I live in Woolwich. I am the parent/guardian of a son 
who has multiple disabilities and receives Section 21 services. He lives in a group 
home in Bath and requires support not only in his daily activities at his home, but also
when engaged in community activities. The support he requires must be provided by 
skilled professionals who should be appropriately compensated for their challenging 
work.
I regret being unable to attend the public hearings held to discuss LD 744 (Resolve, to
Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to Perform Rate Studies and 
Rate Determinations for Providers of Certain Services for Adults with Intellectual 
Disabilities or Autism Spectrum Disorder). This bill would require that rate studies 
for MaineCare HCBS Group Home Services, as well as Community Supports and 
Community Membership services for individuals with intellectual disabilities like my 
son be completed in a timely manner. 
Getting this rate study done would provide the legislature and OADS with the data 
needed to determine what the actual costs for providing services to my son look like. 
It would hopefully allow agencies to attract skilled staff for the services they provide 
to my son and others. Given the current economic environment, competitive wages 
are absolutely necessary in order to attract and retain the quality workforce that is 
required to support my son and so many other Mainers.
I ask that you please support LD 744. 
Thank you,
David Cowing 
Woolwich
