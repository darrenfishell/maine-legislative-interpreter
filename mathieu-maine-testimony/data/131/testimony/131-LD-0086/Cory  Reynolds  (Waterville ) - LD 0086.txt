Cory  Reynolds 
Waterville 
LD 86
Dear Members of the Committee State and Local Government:
My Name is Cory Reynolds I am Writing my testimony today in Opposition on 
LD-86 - An Act to Restore the Former Maine Flag. Sponsored By Rep. Sean Parlous 
Of Bath Maine. I Do Not Support this Bill because I believe there's nothing wrong 
with the Flag we have had for year's. I Like the color Blue and the history that goes 
along with the flag. Democrats are trying to take away our history and it needs to 
stop. Let's get rid of this bill, and worry about the Homelessness, and Mental Health 
Crisis. Drugs Epidemic
Thank You,
Republican Cory Reynolds
