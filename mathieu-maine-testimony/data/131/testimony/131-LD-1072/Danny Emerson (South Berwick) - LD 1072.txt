LD 1072
I oppose LD 1072, “An Act Regarding the Bureau of Motor Vehicles”, specifically, 
Sec. 4. 29-A MRSA §160 is enacted to read: 22 §160. Restriction of weapons in 
bureau offices.  “A person may not carry firearms, dangerous weapons, explosives, 
incendiary devices or implements that by their nature are capable of being used to 
injure a person or destroy property in any bureau office. This section does not apply 
to a law enforcement officer who is on duty or off duty. 
 The last thing that Mainers need is a New York style ban on carrying self-defense 
guns while outside the home.  
Maine has always been one of the safest states in the nation. It is not the “wild west” 
as many indicated it would be if Constitutional Carry were enacted. It was enacted, 
and we are still the safest state in the nation. This is a solution looking for a problem 
that does not exist. It is yet another partisan attack on our Maine and United States 
Constitutional right to bear arms (shall never be questioned/infringed), recently 
upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States Bruen decision.
Mainers have a long track record of carrying and using firearms in a responsible and 
safe manner. So law-abiding Maine residents should not be forced to choose between 
self/family/loved ones protection, or going to the BMV.
Again, I oppose LD 1072, “An Act Regarding the Bureau of Motor Vehicles”, 
specifically, Sec. 4. 29-A MRSA §160 is enacted to read: 22 §160. Restriction of 
weapons in bureau offices, and it “ought not to pass” unless this section is stricken.
