Testimony of Represem ‘ative .Mic:I1ael Brennan Introducing 
LD 1164, An Act to Continue the Department of Education Diploma Program 
Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Aﬂairs 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty and fellow distinguished members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Michael Brennan, and I represent House District ll5, 
which includes a portion of Portland. I am here to introduce LD 1164, An Act to Continue the 
Department of Education Diploma Program Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
LD 1164 would simply allow the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) to continue granting 
high school diplomas to students whose education was disrupted due to COVID-19. 
Legislation was approved two years ago allowing the MDOE to grant diplomas when a studenfs 
path to graduation was negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
Since then, we have seen that COVID-19 can have lasting and long-term consequences ona 
student’ s educational progress. This bill recognizes these consequences and provides a student 
the latitude and ﬂexibility to complete their high school education. 
I am sure everyone would agree that graduating from high school is a critically important 
milestone for every student. I believe it is incumbent upon us to take every reasonable step to 
facilitate the attainment of that goal. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
District 115: Part of Portland
