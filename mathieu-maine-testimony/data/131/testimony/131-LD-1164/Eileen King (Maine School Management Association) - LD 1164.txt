TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF  
 
L.D. 873—AN ACT TO CONTINUE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DIPLOMA PROGRAM 
RELATED TO THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC  
 
AND  
 
L.D. 1164—AN ACT TO CONTINUE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DIPLOMA PROGRAM 
RELATED TO THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King , deputy executive director  of Maine  School Management Association, testifying on behalf  of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association  in support of L.D. 873 and L.D. 1164.  
 
Our associations supported L.D. 1318 last sessio n, and we support it today.  
 
L.D.’s 873 and 1164  focus  on allowing a 4th year secondary school student to obtain  a Department of 
Educat ion Diploma if they have  experi enced a signific ant dis ruption to th eir education as a result of the 
Covid -19 pandemic  that puts  graduating  at risk . The goal is key if we hope to see these students get th e 
education they need to move onto meaningful work that s upports them and a vibrant Maine economy.  
 
As school leaders we believ e the  requirements in th ese bills for school districts are doable. Evidence that a  
student  has met these requirements  may include, but is not limited to transcri pts, waiver, academic  repor ts and 
schoolwork  recognition plans. These requ irements allow the student to meet these standards w ith some 
flexibility and a choice of di fferent pathways.  
 
We urg e your su pport  for th ese bills. It is the right thing to do for st udents and for the state .
