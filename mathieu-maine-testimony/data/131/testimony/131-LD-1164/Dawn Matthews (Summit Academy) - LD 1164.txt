Re: LD 1164 An Act to Continue the Department of Education Diploma Program 
Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
At Summit Academy, a public 9-12 alternative school, we have utilized the Maine 
Department of Education (MDOE) Educational Disruption diploma several times to 
help students receive a diploma when they had lost hope of graduating high school.  
This alternative path to graduation has been a godsend.
If LD 1164 sunsets in September of 2023, then many of the students who are 
currently in their third year of high school will not be eligible for the MDOE diploma.
Those students’ education was affected by Covid-19 as much as the students who are 
graduating in 2023!
I encourage you to pass LD 1164, An Act to continue the Department of Education 
Diploma Program Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, to benefit Maine’s students 
and future workforce.
Thank you for your consideration,
Dawn Matthews
