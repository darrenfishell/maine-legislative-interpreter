Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich , and members of the ENR Committee:  
 
I represent no agency or entity other than myself and write testimony LD 1641 . 
We may be one of the few states left in the country that still relie s on the 1873 judge -made law call ‘’Absolute 
Dominion’’.  
Absolute Dominion cannot stand when the user(s) exhibit neg lect, interference, and abuse.  
There is a legal argument that there has been decades of neglect, interference, and abuse regarding water 
extraction here in the State of Maine, thus nullify any claim to that right.  
I’d like to ask that the State finish it’s legal obligation and define ‘’reasonable use’’, define the bulk extraction 
export uses, and acknowledge regional impacts beyond th e wellhead, and acknowledge that these are the legal 
right of political subdivisions to evaluate, impose regulations, and either approve or deny.  
We should no longer be an Absolute Dominion state, that is very clear. The only question is really when the St ate 
gain the understanding of the current reality and future risks.  
Title 38 section 404 is a very limited protection that cannot be relied on.   
Sure we have tons of water, sure extraction exporters take just a ‘’sip’’  (like the one who controls 96% of the  
water bottling market in this state ), but b ased on large -scale water extraction occurring  in Fryeburg Maine, 
there isn’t capacity for new agricultural farms to be created  there .  
Think about that  for a minute.  When will a sip become more than a sip?  
The 2 005 and 2022 Water committees both punted these items for future folks to figure out, and this has been a 
continued disservice to all Mainers.  
Thank you.  
Dan
