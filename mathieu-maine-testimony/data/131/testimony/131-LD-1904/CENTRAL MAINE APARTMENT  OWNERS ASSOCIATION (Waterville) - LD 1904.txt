To the Distinguished Members of the Housing Committee: 
 
Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD Opposition to LD 1904: An Act to Enact Maine Fair Chance Housing Act  
 
The Central Maine Apartment Owners Association (CMAOA) is a landlord membership organization of over 
650, as well as a cooperative team member of other landlord associations across the State of Maine including: 
Southern Maine, Lewiston Auburn, Greater Bangor Area, and Augusta Area.  We provide educational events, 
sponsor community events, provide access to discounts on supplies and industry needs like fuels, flooring 
materials and paint. Our overall goal is to support Landlords in providing safe and affordable housing in 
collaboration with the valuable good renters in our area.  CMAOA and the other organizations are neutral, 
nonpartisan, member led groups that have the common goal of keeping the rental housing industry safe, 
educated, and competitive.   
Although this bill has many areas of concern of detrimental effects to the offering of private rental housing, 
CMAOA has overwhelmingly heard from their members that the current wave of legislation is going to 
exacerbate the housing crisis.  Limiting access to criminal records should be an issue to define through the 
courts and press.  Landlords use various LEGAL ways to check references and make good decisions on the best 
for their properties and their existing tenants.  This bill is further legislation that is being presented this session 
that takes the wrong approach toward solving the housing crisis. 
We urge you to oppose LD 1904.  
Board of Directors of Central Maine Apartment Owners Association, Waterville, Maine
