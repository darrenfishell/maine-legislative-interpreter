Testimony in support of LD 1904 
to the Committee on the Judiciary 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the 
Committee ‘ 
My name is Peter Lehman and I live in Thomaston. I am a fonnerly incarcerated 
citizen, a sociologist and a person in long-tenn recovery.* I am testifying on behalf 
of the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition whose goal is to promote restorative 
practices in order to increase public safety and the health of our community 
Members of this Committee are already familiar with many of the issues around 
making criminal records public and accessible or sealing or expunging them.I 
believe you are also acutely aware of the huge negative impact that use of criminal 
records has on foimer offenders and their families, especially in employment and 
housmg 
This morning I want to talk directly as a sociologist/criminologist about the 
relationship between public safety and public criminal records. What are the public 
safety implications of making criminal records more accessible and available to use 
for employment and housing decisions ‘? 
The answer 1S that makmg criminal records more accessible doesn’t make us safer 
Let me repeat that. making crimmal records more accessible doesn’t make us safer. 
Making them more available does NOT reduce recidivism ——the fancy Word for re- 
offending Period 
How do I know that‘? Well, for one thing, jurisdictions that have made them less 
accessible have not experienced more recidivism. In fact, the evidence is just the 
opposite —making them less accessible REDUCES criminal behavior.1

College of Crimmal Justice report, Beyond the Record See also a less recent but valuable set of

As another example, countries such as France, and in fact the whole of the European 
Umon, hold records much more conﬁdential than we do. And they have much LESS 
repeat criminality. 
And many of our assumptions and presumptions about people with criminal records 
turn our to be untrue. Corporations and companies that have taken initiatives to hire 
MORE people with criminal records report that not only 1S recidivism reduced but 
the quality and retention of their workforce has improved. Ask Dave’s Killer Bread 
or Target2 
The bottom line is that making crimmal records more and more accessible to the 
public, including landlords, 1S NOT an evidence-based practice for making us safer 
or reducing repeat criminality. 
In fact, making records more accessible turns out to be quite effective in producing 
exactly the opposite result. It increases repeat offending. 
I am attaching the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Department 
Guidelines for housing decisions that already already limit use of criminal records 
It is important that Maine landlords begm to use them. 
This legislation builds on these guidelines. It does not ban the use of criminal 
records but gives the same sort of guidance as the HUD Guidelines, making it 
locally visible and providing for local avenues to resolve disputes 
We urge you to support LD 1904. 
Thank you for your generous attention 
I’d be happy to try to answer questions.

Those with criminal records who are hired generally make better employees The Center for 
American Progress, hardly known for its liberalism, estimates that excluding these people from the 
workforce costs the economy billions of dollars Economists estimate that the cost of barring these 
individuals from the workforce 1S roughly $78 to $87 billion m lost gross domestic product

HUD Guidelines, 2016 
In 2016, The United States Department of Housing and Urban 
Development issued guidance to help housing providers avoid 
liability for racial discrimination related to the use of conviction 
records while screening applicants. Below are the main points 
for landlords or other housing providers to consider: 
0 Landlords cannot issue blanket bans on anyone witha 
conviction history. 
0 Landlords cannot deny housing opportunities on the basis of 
an arrest record. 
0 If using background checks, landlords must perform them 
consistently, rather than using them selectively with some 
applicants based on stereotypes or fears. 
~ Landlords must consider applicants on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into consideration both the nature and the severity of 
the conviction and how much time has passed. It is essential 
to make a decision based only on the facts. 
0 It is legal to deny an applicant housing if a recent conviction 
poses a clear risk to other tenants or neighbors. However, 
that decision must stem from credible evidence; it cannot be 
based on hypotheticals or speculation. 
0 A denial must also offer evidence that the housing provider 
or landlord has a legitimate, discrimination free reason for 
their decision. 
0 A denial must also show that the landlord's underlying policy 
differentiates criminal conduct that poses a verifiable risk to 
property and/or resident safety from criminal conduct that 
does not.
