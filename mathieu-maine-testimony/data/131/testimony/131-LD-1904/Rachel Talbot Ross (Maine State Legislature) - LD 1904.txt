RACHEL TALBOT ROSS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
Monday, May 15th, 2023 
T estzmony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross supportmg 
LD 1904, An Act to Enact the Maine Fair Chance Housing Act 
Before the Joznt Select Commzttee on the Judzczary 
Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen and esteemed members of the J omt 
Standlng Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, I am Rachel Talbot Ross I represent House 
D1str1ct 118 Wl11Cl’1 1s the Portland penmsula I also have the d1st1nct honor of servlng 
as the Ma1ne Speaker of the House I am here today to present LD 1904, An Act to 
Enact the Maine Fair Chance Housing Act. 
Th1s b1ll 1s a cont1nuat1on of work that I began 1n the 129th Legislature At 
that t1me I proposed a b1ll, LD 1572, that was very slmilar to the one before you 
today Eventually, 1n the 130th Leglslature, I mtroduced LD 1201, Resolve, 
Directing the Maine State Housing Authority To Engage Stakeholders in an 
Examination of Fair Chance Housing Policy Options That was enacted and 
became Resolve, Chapter 75 1n 2021 The Mame State Hous1ng Authorlty 1ssued1ts 
Report m August of 2022 Both of those b1lls were before the J o1nt Standmg 
Commlttee on Labor and Housmg and the Report was presented to that Cormmttee I 
w1ll dlscuss that Report later and have attached 1t to my test1mony today LD 1904 1s 
before you because 1t amends the Mame Htunan Rights Act wh1ch falls w1th1n the 
]ur1sd1ct1on of the Comm1ttee 
Housmg 1s among the most very bas1c of a person’s needs and 1s fundamental 
to an md1v1dual ’s success and well-be1ng For people who have been mvolved 1n the 
cr1m1nal _]l1S1ZlC6 system, however, a safe, appropriate place to call home 1s often kept 
out of reach Accord1ng to the Prison Pohcy In1t1at1ve, “[p]eople who have been to 
pI‘lS01’1_]l1St once expenence homelessness at a rate nearly 7 tlmes h1gher than the 
general publ1c” and “people who have been 1ncarcerated more than once have rates 
13 tlmes h1gher than the general publ1c” 
The 1nab1l1ty to access hous1ng 1s a tremendous barrler when reentermg one’s 
commun1ty after lncarceratlon, contnbutlng to poor outcomes such as recldlvism 
District 118: Portland nelghborhoods of Parks1de, Bays1de, East Bays1de, Oakdale and the 
Un1vers1ty of Southern Ma1ne Campus
Th1s 1s demonstrated by the fact that, accordlng to the advocacy organlzatlon 
Opportumty Starts At Home, “recent homelessness 1s far more common among 
[mcarcerated people] than the general populatlon” 
The Pnson Pol1cy Initlatrve has also reported that affordable and safe housmg 
1s a necesslty and 1s cr1t1cal for creatmg a socrety wherem people who have been 
directly affected by the crlmlnal Justlce system can thrlve We are all aware of the 
desperate need for affordable housmg for all populatlons throughout MameA 
cr1m1na1 record only compounds that problem by further l1m1tmg those optlons for 
formerly mcarcerated persons LD 1904 addresses that problem head on by declarmg 
1t 1s the publrc pol1cy of the State to ensure that equ1table access to safe, decent and 
affordable hous1ng extends to all resrdents of the State, 1nclud1ng 1nd1v1duals 
mvolved 1n the cr1m1nal _]l.1St1C6 system and therr fam1l1es 
In order to advance that publlc pol1cy, th1s b1ll creates the Mame Farr Chance 
Housmg Act to ensure that a person 1s not demed housmg based solely on the 
exrstence of a hlstory of cr1m1nal conv1ct1ons Th1s b1ll proh1b1ts a housmg prov1der 
from cons1der1ng an appl1cant's cr1m1nal hlstory untll after the housmg provlder 
determlnes that the appllcant meets all other qual1ﬁcat1ons for tenancy In that way 1t 
1s s1m1lar to the ban the box law that enhances the ab1l1ty of formerly mcarcerated 
persons to obtaln meanmgful employment It 1s another tool to help _]LlSlI1C6 mvolved 
Malners, who have pa1d the1r debt to soc1ety for pr1or mlsdeeds, to become part of 
the communlty, to thrrve, and to contrlbute to Ma1ne’s economy wrth the1r labor and 
by paylng taxes for the salary earned by that labor However, 1f we do not do all that 
we can to help these persons secure safe and affordable housmg none of that w11l be 
possrble 
I Want to take a moment to demonstrate the s1mpl1c1ty of LD 1904 and ask 
you to cons1der the power 1n 1ts s1mpl1c1ty The prrmary thmg that th1s b11l does 1s to 
create a soclety Where a formerly mcarcerated person has a fa1r chance when they 
are trymg to rent a home The law states that a “hous1ng provlder may not mqulre 
1nto or cons1der an appl1cant ’s cr1m1nal hrstory unt1l the housmg provrder has 
determlned that the apphcant meets all other qualrﬁcatrons for tenancy ” LD 1904 
s1mply seeks to ensure that housmg provlders cons1der a person’s financlal and other 
quahﬁcatlons before askmg about prlor mvolvement w1th the cr1m1nal Justlce 
system It does not, I repeat does not, prevent the questlon from belng part of the 
overall process or bemg used by the housmg provrder 1n maklng a ﬁnal dec1s1on 
LD 1904 1s very s1m1lar to the approach used at the federal level by the US 
Department of Housmg and Urban Development (HUD) In 2016, HUD released
guldance that recognlzed that blanket bans agalnst people W1th cr1m1nal records 
could vlolate the federal Fa1r Housmg Act 1n l1ght of the d1sproport1onate numbers 
of people of color 1n the cr1m1na1 Justrce system Prov1d1ng ]ust1ce 1nvolved persons 
W1th a fa1r chance advances the purposes behmd the landmark Fa1r Housmg Act 
If enacted, LD 1904 W111 rmprove the l1ves of a slgnrﬁcant number of people 
The Department of Correctlons releases approx1mately 100 adults back 1nto the 
commumty every month The Department 1s Well aware that these men and Women 
face very real challenges Reducmg the barrlers to obta1n1ng safe and affordable 
housmg can help fac1l1tate reentry and 1mprove the l1ves of those adults and thelr 
fam1l1es 
In order to protect the rrght to a fa1r chance for housmg, LD 1904 does conta1n 
an adm1n1strat1ve enforcement mechamsm A person who 1s aggr1eved by a v1olat1on 
of the Mame Fa1r Chance Housmg Act by a hous1ng prov1der may ﬁle a grlevance 
w1th the Ma1ne Human R1ghts Comm1ss1on Today, however, I am presentmg an 
amendment to the b1ll that removes the ab1l1ty of that aggr1eved person to ﬁlea 
prlvate r1ght of act1on 1n court by el1m1nat1ng 5 M R S A §4775 (2) 
As I close my testlmony today, I ask you to cons1der the Work done by the 
Mame State Housmg Author1ty In response to the Resolve passed 1n the 130th 
Leglslature, the Hous1ng Author1ty Worked W1th a very broad group of stakeholders 
that mcluded hous1ng prov1ders, landlords, currently and formerly lncarcerated 
persons, c1v1l r1ghts and economlc ]ust1ce organ1zat1ons, the Department of 
Correctrons, housmg advocates and others to examlne fa1r chance hous1ng polrcy 
opt1ons They also engaged the Vera Instrtute of J ustrce, a natronal non-proﬁt that 
works to 1mprove ]ust1ce systems 
The Report 1ssued by that stakeholder group began by drscussmg why fa1r 
chance 1n hous1ng 1s so lmportant 
Access to adequate housmg that 1s safe, stable, and affordable 1sa 
fundamental need for all persons and fam1l1es 1n order to fl0l11‘1Sl1 1nd1v1dually 
and w1th1n a communlty The drfﬁculty 1n ﬁndmg affordable housmg surtable 
to a households needs has been well documented The barners faced by 
Justlce mvolved 1nd1v1dua1s 1n a tlght housmg market are more acute than the 
average households as, they are often screened out because of the1r conv1ct1on 
hlstory Some are forced to take substandard housmg wh1le others are forced 
to _]6Op21I ‘d1Z6 the1r fam1ly’s tenancy by re] o1n1ng a household wrthout bemgon
J 
the lease These barrlers create revolvlng doors of homelessness and 
lncarceratlon 
LD 1904 provrdes a mechan1sm to break these patterns and to dlsrupt the 
revolvlng door of mcarceratlon to homelessness to rec1d1v1sm LD 1904 advances 
equlty and soclal _]LlS'£1C6 and helps _]llSlZ1C6 lnvolved 1nd1v1duals reenter soc1ety and 
strengthen the1rl1ves, the l1ves of thelr fam1l1es and our commun1t1es It 1s hard to 
anyone to bu1ld a successful l1fe Wlthout a place to call home 
I thank you for your t1me and attentlon th1s mornlng and ask that you act 
favorably on LD 1904 I am happy to answer any questlons that you mlght have
