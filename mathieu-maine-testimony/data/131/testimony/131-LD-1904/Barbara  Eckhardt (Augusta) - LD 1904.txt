"I vote no on LD 1904 
This law will waste housing provider's time and the applicants time during the 
screening process. For example, if a housing provider won't rent to sex offenders, 
there is no point walking them through the whole process only to refuse them at the 
end once that fact is disclosed.
-Housing violent criminals will increase risk to our good tenants living in the same 
building. "
