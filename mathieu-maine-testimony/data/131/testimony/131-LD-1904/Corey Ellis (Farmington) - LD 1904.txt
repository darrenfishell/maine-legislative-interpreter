Dear Committee:  
RE: LD1904 
I am w riting in op position to this bil l. 
One question for you all to ponder:  
Would you want someone w ith a vi olent cr iminal history to be allowed to rent next to you or your 
childre n? 
I understand the premise of this bill. As a la ndlord I consider all pro spects and have al lowed people who 
have a pas t rent from me. I have had good and bad experi ences.  It is all based on the person and what 
they have for a criminal history  and how far back it goes.  
In all fairness to other ten ants, they s hould be allowed to live in a peace and not have to worry who is 
staying in the apar tment upstairs  or down the hall  without consideration.  
Also as far as prior evi ctions, those are important thi ngs to know . Can you go to a bank with bad cre dit 
and get a loan? There â€™s a good reason these ten ants have an evi ction on their record and that has to do 
with behavior. Rewarding bad behavi or is NOT a good solution to anything  and o nly creates bad 
occupancies.  
This bill could create  dangerous situations and should be not conside red for passing.  
Thank you,
