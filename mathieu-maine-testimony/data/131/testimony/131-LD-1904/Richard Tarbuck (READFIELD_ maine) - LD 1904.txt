I oppose this bill because it appears to encourage opacity in the application process 
with much resulting risk and little in the way of benefit to either the tenant or the 
landlord. The prospect of a prospective tenant with an axe to grind initiating a Human
Rights Commission action 300 days after an alleged offense coupled with the time 
and legal expense in dealing with it it certainly would be a deterrent to investors who 
want to develop new housing opportunities. It's also not clear what would be the 
result of a prospective tenant who decides not to reveal his or her history if they 
occupy a building also inhabited by children.
Everybody needs a place to live and everybody should get a second chance, but this 
seems to be an extremely heavy-handed approach to solving that problem.
