I am Roger Buck, of Portland, ME. I am opposed to this bill. It will significantly slow 
the process of approving tenants by not allowing criminal history to be checked until 
all other screening is done. This will make the already difficult process of securing 
new housing even more trying. By encouraging housing providers to not check 
criminal history, it will put other tenants at risk. This bill is bad for both tenants and 
housing providers.
