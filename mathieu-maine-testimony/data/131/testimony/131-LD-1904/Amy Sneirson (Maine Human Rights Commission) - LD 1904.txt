Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary

Re LD 1904, "An Act to Enact the Maine Fair Chance Housing Act" 
Dear Sen Carney, Rep Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
The Maine Human Rights Commission ("Commission") - the State agency charged with enforcing the 
Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M R S §§ 4551, et seq ("MHRA") - has the duty of investigating, conciliating, and 
at times litigating protected-class discrimination cases under the MHRA It is also charged with promulgating 
rules and regulations to effectuate the MHRA, and with making recommendations for legislation or executive 
action concerning infringements on human rights or personal dignity in Maine 5 M R S § 4566(7), (11) To 
that end, the Commission is pleased to provide this testimony neither for nor against LD 1904 
LD 1904 targets unlawful housing discrimination in line with the MHRA 
The MHRA bars discrimination in housing based on a person's innate characteristics, such as race or 
color, sex, disability, religion, age, sexual orientation or gender identity, and national origin Race 
discrimination in housing was one of the key reasons that anti-discrimination laws were established in this 
country in the 19605, as African-American combat veterans returned home from fighting for democracy in 
wars abroad but were unable to get good j0bS or housing at home Unfortunately, in the 50 years since those 
laws were established in Maine and the United States, race discrimination has not been eradicated This IS 
shown to be true in all aspects of housing, but is particularly notable in applications In study after study, 
white applicants receive more responses and housing opportunities than black applicants, even when the 
candidates have no criminal history and are identical in every other respect This has been demonstrated 
when the name of the applicant indicates that the applicant is African-American, or the applicant's voice 
sounds African-American 
Housing providers surely do not want to run afoul of laws like the MHRA, and look for ObjeCtlV8 
criteria for making rental decisions One such commonly used query on housing applications IS whether an 
applicant has a criminal history It is understandable that housing providers want to know all they can about 
people to whom they are considering renting their homes, and asking about criminal history seems like an 
ObjeC’tlVE and neutral inquiry that would provide useful information to prospective housing providers

Utilizing criminal history as an initial exclusion for hiring removes qualified and motivated applicants 
of all races and colors from the workforce, but it also perpetuates racism Unfortunately, because our 
nation's criminal jUStlCe system disproportionately polices, arrests and convicts people from communities of 
color as compared to people perceived to be white by many orders of magnitude, asking about the existence 
of criminal history on an housing application has a disparate impact on individuals from communities of color 
In essence, asking about criminal history can become a proxy for asking about an applicant's color, even 
inadvertently The federal government has recognized this, and issued guidance in 2016 to help housing 
providers recognize this issue as real 
Neither our country nor Maine has managed to eradicate discrimination based on race in housing 
LD 1904 represents one approach to combatting unlawful discrimination in housing by removing the inquiry 
about criminal history from applications for housing Known colloquially as ”Ban the Box” (”BTB"), because it 
bars housing providers from putting a check-box on initial applications for a person with criminal history to 
check off, this approach is being adopted all around the country to protect applicants and convicted ofa 
crime from automatic disqualification during the housing application process BTB is easy to adopt and 
attractive to housing providers because it simply delays when an housing provider can ask about and consider 
an applicant's criminal history rather than barring consideration of such history altogether The intent is to 
give a housing provider time to gauge an applicant's qualifications before considering criminal history, and to 
allow a potential tenant to engage in a discussion about the criminal history that would never happen if the 
housing provider as a matter of practice ruled out anyone with criminal history from the start 
LD 1904 likely will have substantial impact on the Commission 
While the goal of LD 1904 is critically important, the Commission would be remiss if it did not discuss 
how the bill would impact our agency's workload and functioning in several key aspects 
0 Section 2 
0 Conducting periodic reviews with private housing providers to assess compliance with BTB 
There is no indication of what this would entail No matter what it does include, however, 
the Commission currently does not have sufficient staffing to accomplish this and would 
require additional staffing The Commission also would need to create a regulation, and 
public enforcement materials, for private housing providers to follow before the 
Commission could enforcing "assess compliance" 
o Addiing a fine structure for the Commission to follow regarding alleged BTB violations The 
MHRA does not currently authorize the Commission to impose fines, or provide any 
mechanism for doing so The Commission would need to create a regulation, public 
enforcement materials, and standard operating procedures with the State Treasurer, 
before imposing fines 
o Inserting a requirement that the Commission conduct ”compliance counseling" with 
housing providers who have violated BTB 
0 Section 3 
o The proposed scope of LD 1904 (in what would be new § 4777) definition of a ”housing 
provider" subject to LD 1904 is broader than the current MHRA definition of ”housing 
accommodation" providers subject to the MHRA 
I The MHRA currently prohibits ”any owner, lessee, sublessee, managing agent or 
other person having the right to sell or rent or manage a housing accommodation, 
or any agent ofthese" from discriminating based on protected-class status 5 MRS
5/1,5/2024 MHRC LD 1904 Page3 
§ 4581-A A ”housmg accommodat|on ” ”|ncludes any bu|ld|ng or structure or 
port|on thereof, or any parcel of land, developed or undeveloped, that |s occupned, 
or |s Intended to be OCCUplEd or to be developed for occupancy, for res|dent|al 
purposes" (5 M R S § 4553(6)) The MHRA expllcltly carves out an exception for 
owner-occup|ed housmg |f |t IS a duplex or rents out fewer than four rooms5 
|v| R s § 4581(4) 
I Applymg BTB to all prov|ders of hous|ng, even those not currently subject to the 
MHRA (owner-occup|ed homes |n wh|ch four or fewer rooms are rented out and 
owner-occup|ed duplexes) l|keIy represents a s|gmf|cant number of rental s|tuat|ons 
|n Ma|ne, mak|ng those housing accommodatlons SUb]GCt to the MHRA w|l| adda 
s|gn|f|cant number of |ntakes and complalnts for the Comm|ss|on to rev|ew, screen, 
draft, and mvestlgate 
0 Staff tlme to amend Intake and compla|nt forms (Engl|sh plus ﬁve other languages), pUb|lC 
educatlon publlcatlons, etc 
In order to |mplement LD 1904's valuable goals, the Comm|ss|on essentlally would need to createa 
new program New resources needed would |nclude at least two new full-tlme MHR lnvestlgator pos|t|ons 
(mtake, |nvest|gat|on), a new full-t|me attorney (draft|ng regulatlons and publrc |nformat|on, rev|ew|ng

staffer, and fundlng for technology updates (our Internal database and websrte) 
Conclusion 
Thank you for the opportumty to prov|de thls test|mony about LD 1904 The Comm|ss|on w||l be glad 
to d|scuss th|s matter at your COFIVEHIGHCE and/or be present at the work sessron for further dehberatlon
