Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, good mommg My name 1s Mlchael Klebede, and I am Pollcy Counsel 
at the ACLU of Mame, a statewlde organlzatlon commltted to advancmg and preservmg c1v1l

Approxunately 70 m1ll1on people 1n the Unlted States have Cl‘lI1'111'l ﬁlI‘6C0l‘dS1 The lmpact 
of a cr1m1nal record on a person’s hfe can be devastatlng, the Amerlcan Bar Assoclatlon has 
1dent1fied over 45,000 collateral consequences of havlng a cr1m1nal record 2 These lnclude barrlers 
to hous1ng, educatlon, llcensmg, and employment, among other thlngs They can haunt a person 
for decades after that person has served the1r court-ordered sentence Collateral consequences have 
become so ublqultous that that they lmphcate key constltutlonal concerns for people convlcted of 
crnnes, such as the proportlonallty of a person’s sentence (the Elghth Amendment) and due process 
(the Flﬂh and Fourteenth Amendments) 
Beyond the legal arguments, there are pollcy 1mpl1cat1ons for cr1m1nal records as well 
Wlthout access to shelter or employment, rt 1s much harder, for returmng c1t1zens to successfully 
mtegrate back 1nto thelr commun1t1es Safe,{ rel1able housmg 1s a foundatlonal element from whlch 
people can seek and mamtam steady employment and keep or regam custody Br thelr l(ldS Barr1ers 
to housmg can mean fewer healthy famlhes, less stab1l1ty 1n our communltles, and fuller _]a1ls and 
pnsons By creatmg a foundatlon on Wh1Ch returnlng c1t1zens can have the best chance of rejommg 
the1r commtmrtles, the leglslature can free up resources that we currently spend on the revolvmg

Thls b1ll takes a very balanced approach to th1s senous problem If enacted, 1t would 
proh1b1t landlords from consrdermg an appl1cant ’s crlmmal hrstory unt1l after the landlord 
determmes that the appllcant meets all other quallﬁcatrons for tenancy Importantly, thls b1ll would 
not take away landlords ’ ab1l1ty to look at renters’ cr1m1nal hlstorres It would only prevent a snap 
Judgment at the outset of someone’s appllcatron based on a cnmmal record Once the landlord 
determmes that the renter meets all other quahﬁcatlons for tenancy, then the landlord can look at 
the renters’ crlmmal hlstory mformatlon If a landlord vlolates any of the prov1s1ons of the b111, the 
b1ll would also ’g1ve tenants the nght to ﬁle a lawsult agarnst the landlord, provlded that the 
tenant ﬁrst recelves a favorable op1n1on from the Mame Human Rlghts Commlsslon Th1s b1ll’s 
proposed general rule, and 1ts proposed remedy, would both help solve the problem of 
drscrlmlnatlon agalnst people wrth cr1m1nal records We urge you to vote ought to pass
