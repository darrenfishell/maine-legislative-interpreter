Dear Judiciary Committee members 
My name is Michael Morey and I operate two rental buildings in the Waterville area I am writing today to stress my 
opposition to LD 1904, An Act To Enact The Maine Fair Chance Housing Act. Although I ﬁrmly believe in giving people 
second chances who are truly trying to turn their lives around, I also firmly believe that I have an obligation to current 
law-abiding tenants to provide them with safe housing for them and their families 
A prospective tenants criminal record is only one factor is the decision-making process of tenant screening and never 
singularly the only factor Like credit scores and other financial information, as a property owner screening for the best 
tenants to occupy my housing, criminal records are taken into consideration as to the nature, time frame, frequency and 
severity of any convictions to determine the prospective tenant's viability 
Without the use of criminal records at the very start of the prospective tenant screening process, I believe I would be 
ethically and morally negligent in my responsibility to all my existing tenants and their families Not having the ability to 
take into consideration criminal convictions for a prospective tenant opens up my law-abiding tenants to potential harm 
from sexual predators, violent criminals, theft, domestic abusers, etc Good tenants will vacate rental units when they 
no longer feel safe in their homes 
Passing this legislation will only make it tougher for people to find good housing as all other screening standards will 
have to be enhanced and strictly adhered to, harming people with no so good credit, income or rental histories thatI 
might have been willing to give a fair chance if I were able to consider criminal convictions up front 
Since when did criminals obtain more rights than responsible law-abiding citizens? This legislation will all but ensure to 
create a new protected class of people individuals involved in the criminal jUSl'IC€ system and their families 
I strongly urge the entire Committee to oppose this piece of bad legislation Thank you very much for your time 
Michael Morey
