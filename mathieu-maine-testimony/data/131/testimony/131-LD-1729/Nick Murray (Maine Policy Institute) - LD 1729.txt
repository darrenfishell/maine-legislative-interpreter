Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1729
and
in
opposition
to
LD
1726
.
We
are
glad
to
see
that
it
is
becoming
widely
recognized
that
family
care
providers
in
Maine
have
been
leaving
the
market
in
droves.
It
took
the
recent
Maine
Children’s
Alliance
report
to
catch
the
attention
of
legislative
leadership.
The
situation
has
been
worsening
overall
since
Maine
Policy
sounded
the
alarm
in
2018.
1
Unfortunately,
LD
1726
from
President
Jackson
fails
to
address
the
root
of
the
problems
we
are
seeing
in
the
market.
Only
LD
1729
from
Sen.
Moore
strikes
at
the
cause
of
the
collapsing
supply
of
providers
and
subsequently
skyrocketing
prices
for
child
care.
Even
though
capacity
has
grown
somewhat,
prices
are
still
prohibitory
for
many
parents.
2
Now,
it
requires
an
urgent
solution.
That’s
why
it
is
time
to
reduce
the
regulatory
burden
on
the
industry
to
expand
options
for
families
all
across
the
state,
for
all
income
levels.
We
can
do
this
without
spending
any
more
taxpayer
dollars.
This
bill
holds
the
path
if
we
choose
to
take
it.
Mainly,
LD
1726
would
merely
throw
more
of
Mainers’
money
at
the
industry,
a
policy
which
has
not
led
to
more
options
or
lower
costs
for
families.
Otherwise,
the
bill
aims
to
create
yet
another
commission
to
find
a
solution
which
is
obvious
to
those
with
an
understanding
of
economics.
Child
care
is
a
business,
and
functions
like
many
other
industries.
When
the
government
raises
costs
for
providers
through
licensing,
enforcing
subjective
“quality”
of
care,
and
incessant
department
rulemaking
on
every
minute
aspect
of
the
business,

the
number
of
folks
who
can
stay
profitable
drops.
When
this
happens,
as
it
has
been
in
Maine
since
at
least
2008
by
our
research,
families
lose
out
most.
What
sponsors
of
LD
1726
don’t
understand
is
that
the
state
cannot
revive
a
withering
industry
by
throwing
money
at
it
every
year.
This
has
been
the
strategy
for
at
least
four
years,
and
it
simply
has
not
worked.
Why
should
we
double-down
on
failing
policy?
LD
1729
would
lower
barriers
for
providers
by
eliminating
onerous
department
requirements
on
licensing
and
employment,
as
well
as
rules
prescribing
35
sq
ft
per
child
space
for
providers,
what
types
of
snacks
may
be
served,
and
the
provision
of
extra
clothing
for
children
in
care,
etc.
Loosening
child-to-staff
ratios
and
aligning
minimum
threshold
for
family
care
licensure
to
national
norms
takes
into
account
the
reality
of
living
in
rural
Maine
and
the
current
stalled
nature
of
the
market.
These
are
basic
reforms
this
legislature
must
pursue
in
order
to
begin
to
solve
the
persistent
stagnation
of
child
care
choices
in
Maine.
Please
deem
LD
1729
“Ought
To
Pass,”
LD
1726
“Ought
Not
to
Pass,”
and
begin
to
unravel
the
web
of
rules
and
regulations
holding
back
child
care
entrepreneurs
from
expanding
to
serve
needy
parents
across
Maine.

The
recent
release
of
the
2023
Kids
Count
Data
Book
by
the
Maine
Children’ s
Alliance
has
garnered
much
media
attention,
and
rightfully
so.
It
includes
droves
of
information
about
Maine’ s
youth
that
help
us
identify
problems
and
form
solutions
that
benefit
children,
parents
and
the
economy
as
a
whole.
In
this
year ’ s
book,
it’ s
noted
that
family
child
care
providers
are
closing
their
doors
at
an
alarming
rate.
Since
2013,
Maine
has
lost
39%
of
family
providers,
undermining
accessibility
and
af fordability
across
the
state.
Maine
Policy
identified
this
trend
in
2018,
when
we
published
an
analysis
that
found
that,
since
2008,
Maine
had
lost
25%
of
all
providers,
and
each
county
had
lost
more
than
one-fifth
of
family
providers.
The
data
are
more
troubling
today .
Since
2008,
every
county
has
lost
at
least
36%
of
family
providers,
while
Hancock,
Knox,
Lincoln,
W aldo
and
Y ork
counties
have
lost
more
than
half.
Unfortunately ,
the
data
book
is
light
on
solutions
that
would
cure
the
problems
that
the
Maine
Children’ s
Alliance,
lawmakers
and
regulators
created
in
the
first
place.
If
these
actors
could
have
their
way ,
there
would
be
no
more
private
child
care
in
Maine
–
no
entrepreneurs
running
day
cares
out
of
their
homes.
Instead,
children
could
attend
only
Head
Start
or
state-subsidized
child
care
centers.
Over
the
last
couple
decades,
the
regulatory
record
shows
more
rules
are
being
added
to
the
books
in
the
name
of
“quality”
while
the
number
of
providers
–
particularly
family
providers
–
disappears.
That’ s
a
problem
for
two
reasons.
First,
child
care
is
subject
to
market
forces
like
supply
and
demand.
If
demand
for
services
holds
steady
or
increases
while
supply
shrinks,
costs
inevitably
go
up.
Second,
family
child
care
is
the
most
af fordable
care
environment
for
families
with
young
children.
In
2021,
the
average
annual
cost
of
child
care
for
a
toddler
in
family
care
was
$7,800,
versus
$1 1,284
in
center -based
care,
a
36%
savings.
For
an
infant
in
center -based
care,
the
cost
is
a
staggering
$1 1,960
–
more
expensive
than
in-state
tuition
at
the
University
of
Maine
–
versus
$8,580
in
family
care,
a
32%
savings.
Rules
like
qualifications
for
providers,
staf f-to-child
ratios
and
other
structural,
observable
qualities
of
a
care
environment
tend
to
significantly
increase
costs
for
providers
–
and,
thus,
consumers
–
without
improving
the
interactions
between
children
and
caregivers.
More
than
200
pages
of
regulations
govern
family
child
care,
child
care
centers
and
nursery
schools
in
Maine.
Maine
is
increasingly
becoming
a
child
care
desert.
But
this
isn’ t
surprising
in
examining
the
regulatory
trends.
When
the
parent
down
the
street
who
has
been
watching
children
out
of
their
home
for
decades
is
no
longer
“qualified”
to
provide
care,
or
the
compliance
costs
are
so
high
that
they’ve
simply
closed
their
doors,
you’ve
got
a
real
problem
on
your
hands.
Interestingly ,
while
family
providers
leave
the
profession,
the
number
of
available
slots
for
care
has
increased,
though
mar ginally .
The
problem,
however ,
is
that
the
industry
is
consolidating
into
center -based
care,
the
most
expensive
option.
W ith
fewer
family
providers
in
rural
areas,
parents
must
make
long
commutes
out
of
their
way
and
pay
a
steep
premium
if
they
can
find
care
at
all.
Thus,
it
isn’ t
a
solution
to
call
for
more
regulations
followed
by
subsidies
and
wage
stipends
–
to
alleviate
the
cost
burdens
posed
by
overregulation
–
which
are
what
decimated
this
industry
in
the
first
place.
Throwing
money
at
something
for
the
sake
of
it
never
solves
the
problem.
The
solution
is
to
eliminate
unnecessary
rules
that
have
reduced
the
number
of
providers
and
driven
up
the
cost
of
care.
Most
states
let
someone
watch
more
children
in
their
home
before
needing
a
license
than
Maine
does,
and
most
states
have
more
relaxed
child-to-staf f
ratios
than
we
enforce.
If
Maine
simply
adopted
rules
in
line
with
national
norms,
the
number
of
providers
and
available
slots
would
immediately
increase
without
undermining
health
and
safety .
Parents
simply
want
a
safe
place
to
bring
their
kids
where
they
can
interact
with
others,
play ,
learn
and
grow .
Child
care
need
not
be
a
wing
of
the
education
system
in
order
to
meet
this
basic
need
of
parents.
