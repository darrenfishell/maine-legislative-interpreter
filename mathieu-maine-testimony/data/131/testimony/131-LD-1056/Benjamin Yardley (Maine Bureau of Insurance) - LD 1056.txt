Re: L.D. 1056, An Act Restricting State Assistance in Federal Collection of Personal 
Electronic Data and Metadata 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The purpose of this letter is to provide you with background information. This bill would 
prohibit, except under limited circumstances, state agencies from assisting federal agencies in 
collecting or using a personâ€™s electronic communications.  The exceptions are if the person has 
consented, a warrant has been issued describing the person, place or thing to be searched or 
seized, or the use of electronic data or metadata is in accordance with a legally recognized 
exception to the federal warrant requirements. 
The Superintendent of Insurance regulates the business of insurance in Maine.  In that capacity, 
the Superintendent has entered into various MOUs with several Federal agencies, such as the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and with the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)1 covering information sharing related to joint investigation 
efforts.   This bill would undercut those efforts by limiting what data the BOI may share.  The 
bill might also make other federal and state enforcement agencies reluctant to renew or enter into 
new information sharing agreements with the Superintendent. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy N. Schott 
Acting Superintendent
