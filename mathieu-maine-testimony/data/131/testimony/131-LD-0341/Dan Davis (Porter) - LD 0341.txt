LD 341
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee,
I am providing testimony in support of LD341, and represent no entity or agency other than 
myself as a resident, property owner, taxpayer, and voter.
Many political subdivisions in Maine don't currently manage the Tree Growth program 
properly, resulting in biased tax rebates for an intent that is not being met.
LD341 would put more burdens on local governments who already can't even get the most 
basic system right and running smoothly. 
It is frustrating to see others in Town getting substantial tax breaks, because of local 
government inability to effectively and consistently manage the process, and then utilizing the
land as if the tree growth program and its regulatory restrictions don't even exist or don't 
matter (because they really don't). 
Most small rural local governments don't have the resources or aren’t willing to apply the 
resources needed to properly manage this existing program. So now these small towns are 
expected to police all dwellings to assure they are ‘’single-family’’ under the Tree Growth 
Program, not VRBO, not HipCamp, not AirBNB, not some non-owner-occupied transient 
rental platform, not split into multiple apartments, and not subject to tripling or quadrupling 
density under LD2003 (Chapter 672 Public Law)? Unlikely.
This is an unfunded State mandate, will the State pay be paying Towns for the additional 
labor to manage, track, and police this idea?
Think about the integrity of the existing system, which isn't there, and think about how passing
LD341 will make it far, far, worse. We may be trying to solve one problem (housing), but this 
will just exacerbate another pre-existing issue.
Once a wood lot is cleared, it's cleared, we can't take it back.
I urge the Committee to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD341.
