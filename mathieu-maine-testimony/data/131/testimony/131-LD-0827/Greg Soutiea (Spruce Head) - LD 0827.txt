LD 827
Greg and Lauren Soutiea, on behalf of the Craignair Inn and Causeway Restaurant 
would like to ask that the legislature oppose LD827. Implementing this measure to 
business in the state, although as currently worded would not apply to our business, 
would impose undue hardship to business owners.
