Testimony of Mike Roland, Bureau of Labor Standards 
Maine Department of Labor 
Neither for Nor Against LD #827 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Public Hearing, l\/larch 14,2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing. I'm l\/like Roland, Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards at the 
l\/lame Department of Labor. I'm here today to testify neither for nor against LD 827, An Act to Allow 
Employees to Request Flexible Work Schedules 
The Department appreciates the intent but takes no position on this bill. We do, however, wish to 
note that if enacted as is the resulting statute would contain no enforcement mechanism to ensure 
compliance. In that case, there would be no additional burden on the Department. 
Thank you for your time and attention. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have now 
or at a future work session.
