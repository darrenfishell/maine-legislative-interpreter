 
Testimony neither in support nor against  LD 827, An Act to Allow Employees to Request Flexible 
Work Schedules  
 
Senator Tipping , Representative Roeder , Members of the Committee:  
 
My name is Geoff Baur .  I am the Vice President of Tax and Government Relations  at IDEXX 
Laboratories and reside in Portland.  I am submitting testimony on  behalf of IDEXX neither 
in support n or against LD 827.  
 
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. is focused on developing work location policies that benefit  
IDEXX, our employ ees and our customers.  On a world -wide basis we have employees 
working within numerous arrangements.  In many of the situations, the optimal work 
arrangement is clear.  For example, production employees by necessity must be on 
location, while our Veterina ry Diagnostic Consultants often work entirely remote.  
However, for many  of our employees the answer is less clear,  and we have developed a 
successful process that allows us to work with our employees to determine the best answer  that works for all.  
 Given  our experiences, we would request that the committee consider that this 
legislation may remove some of the flexibility enjoyed by IDEXX and our employees.  As 
written this law and  its 6-month commitment could force employers to reject requests 
in situatio ns where both the employer and employee might benefit from  experimental 
work arrangements over a shorter period of time .   It has been our experience that 
transparency and dialogue with our employees, along with an openness to experiment 
with various condi tions has led to the best answers for IDEXX and our employees.  
 
Thank you, and I appreciate your consideration.
