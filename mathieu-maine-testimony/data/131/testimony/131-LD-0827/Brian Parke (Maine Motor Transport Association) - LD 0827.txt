Request Flexible Work Schedules ” ,,"_-‘¢,_,,- 
(zanua-41.2; 
Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on 
Labor and Housing. My name is Brian Parke and l am the President and CEO of the Maine 
Motor Transport Association and a resident of Brunswick. The Association is comprised of 
more than 1,700 member companies, whose employees make up a large portion of the 
34,000 people who make their living in the trucking industry in Maine. 
I am here today to testify in opposition to LD 827. 
To be clear, our members value their employees and, as such, coordinate flexibility in their 
schedules whenever possible. Trucking is just like every other blue-collar profession in 
Maine and around the country - we have significant workforce challenges and employee 
retention is just as important as new employee attraction. 
However, we would argue that the likely end result of passing LD 827 would be widespread 
rejection of any requests for long-term flexibility in any situation for fear of getting. sideways 
with these new rules. This is not a result our employers want and it certainly isn't a result our 
valued employees deserve. 
We would note that the component of the bill that would prohibit an employer from disciplining 
an employee who requests a flexible work schedule is okay with us on its face, but it does 
open the door to interpretation of intent when there might be other performance issues at 
play. 
We respectfully ask that you oppose LD 827. 
Thank you for your consideration and for allowing me to testify. I would be happy to answer 
any questions the committee has now or at the Work Session.-
