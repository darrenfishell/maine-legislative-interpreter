2 Main Street, Suite 35-202 Biddeford, ME  04005 (617) 866-8973  February 26, 2023  State and Local Government CommiHee, aHn: Kristen Bowker, CommiHee Clerk c/o LegislaPve InformaPon Oﬃce Cross Building, Room  100 State House StaPon Augusta, ME 04333  Re: LD #632:  Social Work Educa2on Loan Repayment Program  Dear Senator Joseph Raﬀerty, and other members of the CommiHee on IDEA,  I am a clinical social worker in an integrated behavioral health pracPce in Southern Maine.  Given the current, severe lack of behavioral health specialists in our state, too many Maine residents suﬀering with mental health disorders are not ge^ng the treatment they deserve and need.  This disservice is negaPvely impacPng our economy via producPvity loss, heavier use of all health care resources, and greater dependence on government disability programs.    • Our state has an aging social work workforce.  Since COVID, older social workers are choosing rePrement over learning how to navigate tele-behavioral health services. • The current behavioral health reimbursement and wages are not keeping up with inﬂaPon and educaPonal debt. • The social work ﬁeld is less aHracPve today given its high stress and low wages, creaPng unique challenges in recruiPng social work graduates.   The Social Work EducaPon Loan Repayment Bill can help to reduce this negaPve impact on our state.  A state supported student loan repayment program can revitalize the honor associated with being a social worker.  Nobody enters the ﬁeld of social work to make money.  A recogniPon by the state via monetary assistance in student loan repayment can ignite the passion for humanitarian services.  Today’s opportuniPes in technology, allowing for large salaries with liHle to no human contact, have created a deﬁcit in the ﬁelds that focus on mental health, the eﬀects of poverty, race and ethnic marginalizaPon, and the hopes of creaPng stronger communiPes.   I am one who chose passion over monetary beneﬁts.  I was working as an EHR consultant in MassachuseHs.  While my salary was high, my sense of job saPsfacPon was low.  In recogniPon of the need for behavioral health specialists, in 2018 at the age of 50, I lei my job, sold my house, and enrolled in Simmons University's master’s in social work program.  Upon graduaPon, I recognized the diﬃculty of living in MassachuseHs on a $55k salary, so I accepted a posiPon in Maine.  I conPnue to watch my life savings diminish, but I have found my passion.  A forgiveness of student loans would give me, and many others in my posiPon, greater peace of mind in our choice of career.  I urge you all to vote “Yes” on LD #632.   Respecpully submiHed,   Suzanne Marie Staples, LMSW-cc
