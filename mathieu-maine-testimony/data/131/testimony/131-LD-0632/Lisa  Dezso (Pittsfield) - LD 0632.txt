Lisa  Dezso
Pittsfield
LD 632
Dear Senator Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and members of the committee.
My name is Lisa Dezso, LCSW, LADC, CCS, and I live in the town of Pittsfield 
Maine. I am writing today to ask you to support amending LD 632.
I am one of the many who can apply the cliche “I’m a therapist because I love helping
people.” The work that I do is important, not only individually to the people I serve, 
as their lives are valuable to me and they are worthy of help, but to the state of Maine 
as a whole. Maine’s fight against the opioid crisis is also my fight, and the fight of my
colleagues. What is also a fight that my colleagues and I share is student loan debt. 
Obtaining my undergraduate and graduate degrees has left me with a staggering 
$110k+ student loan bill. Many of my colleagues share a similar financial burden. 
This financial burden has left many qualified and amazing potential therapists 
avoiding the field. This avoidance has left a state and nationwide shortage of 
providers. Waitlists for therapy in Maine are months long, with mine personally at 
over five months long. 
My colleagues and I need help. The state needs help and more providers. The people 
you serve need help. Please help us by supporting the amending of LD 632.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Lisa Dezso, LCSW, LADC, CCS
