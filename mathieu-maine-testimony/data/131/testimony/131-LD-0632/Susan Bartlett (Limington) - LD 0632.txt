I am writing to request your support for LD 632 The Social Work Loan Repayment 
Program.  My name is Susan Bartlett, LCSW, CCM, CBIS, from Limington Maine 
and I am 67 years old and semi-retired.  This bill is important because Maine needs to
recruit and retain Social Workers to meet the increasing need for behavioral health 
care and treatment for both children and adults.  I graduated from the University of 
Southern Maine with a Bachelors degree in Social Welfare.  I moved to California to 
and established in-State residency to avoid debt in completing a Masters Degree in 
Social Welfare Organization, Planning and Administration from the University of 
California, Berkeley in 1983.  In 1987 I returned to Maine and have had an exciting 
career in brain injury rehabilitation and rehabilitation counseling.  I continue to work 
at New England Rehabilitation Hospital 4-6 days per month as a per diem Case 
Manager.  
All Masters level Social Workers are required to complete 6 years of University level 
course work.  Clinical Social Workers must complete an additional 2 years of 
supervised practice prior to becoming licensed.  Our work is personally demanding 
and is among the 10 least paid professional occupations nationally.  COVID and the 
Opioid Epidemic have highlighted the critical need for mental health services and the 
inadequate number of professionals to meet these challenges.  This bill to assist with 
student loan repayment will benefit new clinicians and community social workers and
the populations of Maine residents who desperately need them.  Many young people 
are struggling to pay for housing and basic needs.  Those who want to become Social 
Workers need a financial incentive to pursue a career that is meaningful and critically 
important to society, but pays less than may alternative career paths.  Thank you.
