and

T if fany
Roberts,
I
am
writing
in
support
of
funding
LD
623,
â€œAn
Act
Amend
the
Social
W ork
Education
Loan
Repayment
Program
''
My
name
is
Hannah
McBride
and
I
am
from
Plymouth
Massachusetts,
and
now
live
in
Biddeford,
ME
as
I
attend
University
of
New
England.
I
am
a
junior
in
the
BSW
under graduate
program.
I
am
hoping
to
attend
graduate
school
following
my
graduation
in
May
2024.
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
632,
because
it
would
allow
me
to
attend
graduate
school
in
Maine
and
continue
to
live
and
work
in
Maine
as
a
licensed
social
worker .
This
bill
being
funded
would
impact
my
life
for
the
better
because
it
would
allow
me
to
continue
my
education
with
the
reduction
of
loans
I
would
have
to
pay ,
and
remove
major
financial
stress
from
my
life.
This
bill
would
allow
me
to
focus
all
of
my
ener gy
toward
my
education
and
pursuing
Social
W ork
to
better
the
wellbeing
and
quality
of
communities
and
individual
lives
of
Maine
residents.
I
want
to
use
my
education
to
benefit
the
people
of
my
community
and
help
inspire
education
of
social
justice.
My
dream
is
to
work
with
children
and
support
their
progression
through
dif ficult
experiences/trauma
as
I
am
inspired
by
children's
resilience.
I
am
driven
to
be
the
best
social
worker
I
can
be,
and
with
the
funding
of
LD
632,
young,
soon
to
be
social
workers
like
myself
will
be
able
to
focus
on,
and
further
their
education
to
use
that
knowledge
and
help
improve
Maine
overall
wellbeing
and
happiness.
I
believe
that
social
workers
are
capable
of
amazing
things
and
this
opportunity
would
allow
social
workers
to
thrive
and
create
amazing
improvements
in
social
justice,
along
with
the
individual
lives
of
Maine
citizens.
I
hope
that
based
on
the
information
provided
throughout
the
testimony ,
LD
632
will
be
funded
to
support
social
workers
and
our
futures.
Thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
express
my
thoughts,
Committee
on
Innovation,
Development,
Economic
Advancement
and
Business,
Senator
Chip
Curry ,

you
