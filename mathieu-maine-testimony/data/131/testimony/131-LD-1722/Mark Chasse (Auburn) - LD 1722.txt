LD 1722
LD 1722 ought-NOT-to pass as it represents an overeach of government powers. This
bill subverts the words in the constitution "the persuit of happiness " not the 
government control of it. There is NO proof of an emergency. And even in an 
emergency, the government does not have a right to usurp the freedoms declared 
therein.
Thank you.
