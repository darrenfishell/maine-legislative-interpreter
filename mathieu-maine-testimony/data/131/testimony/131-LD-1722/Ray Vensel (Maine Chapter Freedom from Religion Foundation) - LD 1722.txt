Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services,  
This is testimony in SUPPORT of LD 1722, a bill designed to address the significant issues related 
to the health of Maine residents, especially in our underserved rural communities. The bill would 
provide a commission of experts to work to understand the diverse needs of our local regions.  
 
Public health services are inconsistent throughout the state and have frayed over time. Large 
regions have no state services at all, and areas have healthcare systems dealing with the challenges 
of lack of public transportation, limited Internet connectivity, and other issues which affect certain 
populationâ€™s access to health care. Areas where there is public transportation or Internet 
connectivity have other issues affecting health care, such as resources for mental health or housing 
or child care.  
 
The needs and priorities of the various regions of Maine vary to a great degree, and show how 
flexible public health systems need to be. Assigning a panel to assess long term strategies tailored 
to the varying needs of regions of the state will maximize resource usage for all of Maine.  
 
Please vote to approve LD 1722 and protect public health for all.
