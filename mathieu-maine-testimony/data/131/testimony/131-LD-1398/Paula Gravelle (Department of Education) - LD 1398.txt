Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee: 
LD 1398, An Act to Increase Teacher Salaries, proposes to incrementally increase minimum 
teacher salaries beginning in 2024 using federal funds, if available, otherwise using state funds 
until 2032 and afterwards using municipal funds to pay for increases. This bill would set the 
minimum teacher salary at $60,000 by school year 2031-2032. 
In 2019, the Mills Administration, with the help of the Legislature, increased the minimum 
teacher salary to $40,000. While we believe this was an important step toward fairly 
compensating our teachers, the Department of Education and the Mills Administration agree that 
the $40,000 minimum teacher salary remains too low. The increases by year outlined in LD 1398 
allow for school administrative units (SAUs) to beneﬁt from State support as they work towards 
meeting new minimums. 
Increasing the minimum teacher salary is an important aspect of growing and strengthening the 
Maine teacher workforce, but the costs to the SAUs must be considered. The Department will be 
available to provide additional information on LDI398 and respond to any questions during the 
upcoming work session. 
Sincerely,
