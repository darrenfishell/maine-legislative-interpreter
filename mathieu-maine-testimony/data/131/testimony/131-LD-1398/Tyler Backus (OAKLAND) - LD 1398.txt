Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing: My name is Tyler Backus and I am a resident of Oakland, Maine. I write to you 
today in support of LD 1398, An Act to Increase Teacher Salaries. 
Right now there are very few school districts in Maine where a teacher can afford to live 
and teach according to the median income needed to own a house according to 
MaineHousing data found at https://www.mainehousing.org/policy-research/housing-
data/housing-affordability-indexes   
For instance a teacher in my community would need to earn $96,026 per year to 
purchase the median priced home. Though many of these prices are inflated over the 
past years, they are the reality we now live in, and given housing is one of the most 
costly expenses for any household, it does need to be taken into consideration when 
looking at public service salaries. However, even if you were to look back prior to the 
pandemic (2019), the income needed to purchase the median priced home in my 
community was $56,372, which even in the current contract would only be attainable by 
those with over 20 years of teaching. 
Further, as we have seen in the past many school boards and localities are either unable, 
or unwilling, to keep up with minimum teacher salary. For instance we have districts, 
based on their current teacher contract, will be below the $42,500 minimum in 2024-25, 
which on an inflation basis puts them below the $40,000 minimum only achieved this 
current school year. 
Instead of relying on future legislation attempting to keep up with rising costs, the state 
should rely on a metric that will automatically adjust salaries. Given housing is by far the 
largest cost in any budget, and makes up 34% of the CPI calculation, the state should 
localize minimum teacher salary to the district where they teach. 
Thank you for your time.
