In Opposition to  
 
LD 1398 - An Act to Increase Teacher Salaries  
April 20, 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs 
Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert,  and I am providing testimony in opposition to LD 1398  on behalf 
of Maine Municipal  Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Municipal officials recognize and live the same challenges that school officials see with lower- than -
average wages in their chosen public service careers. Local leaders are sympathetic to these challenges but are concerned with the part of LD 1398 that would shift the burden of increased salaries to the property taxpayers beginning in 2032.  
 The consensus of the LPC is that  even though they recognize and understand that teachers’ salaries should 
be increased, if the state would like to mandate teachers’ salaries, they should also be responsible for funding the increase. Each community in Maine varies dramatically, and in more rural areas a higher teacher salary may not be equitable or sustainable, which would impact students by diverting funds from 
curriculum and other instructional needs to pay for higher salaries.  
 
Increased funding from ARPA and ESSER grants have helped municipalities and school districts alike 
address their compensation challenges  on their own and has been accomplished without a state mandate.  
 
The LPC kindly urges you to conside r the funding challenges in rural areas and vote ought not to pass on 
LD 1398. T hank you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
