Testimony of Maine Press Association  Honorable Anne Carney, Senate Chair   Honorable Matt Moonen, House Chair  Joint Committee on Judiciary  April 7, 2023  RE: LD 1397, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee Concerning Records of Disciplinary Actions Against Public Employees  Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Committee on Judiciary,  The Maine Press Association supports this legislation.  Comprising 43 print newspapers and digital news sites across the state, the MPA advocates for the interests of open and transparent government, and access to public records in order to better inform the citizenry. Last fall, the Maine Right to Know Advisory Committee deliberated at length to improve and standardize the retention schedules of personnel disciplinary records of municipal, county and state employees, and to ensure that Freedom of Access Act requests for records result in the production of all relevant documents, including any that have been removed from a personnel file but retained elsewhere. The additional effort to streamline the use of specific language pertaining to record retentions; e.g., standardizing the definitions of “remove”, “purge” and “destroy” in the oversight of record retention and archival storage, will strengthen the framework. For the sake of parity across local and state government, the statutes that govern retention of, and access to, the disciplinary records of public employees — from town offices to public works, sheriffs' offices to state agencies  — must be consistent and readily apparent, without the potential for obfuscation. We appreciate the work involved in amending state statute for improved access to public records, and including a stipulation that final written disciplinary decisions likewise be standardized across state, county and municipal personnel records. This is important premise on which all Maine citizens can rely.
