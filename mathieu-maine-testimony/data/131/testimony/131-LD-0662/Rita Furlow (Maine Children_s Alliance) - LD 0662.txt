I am the Senior Policy Analyst at the Maine Children’s Alliance. The Maine Children’s Alliance, a statewide non-partisan, advocacy organization whose mission is to promote sound public policy and best practices to improve the lives of children, youth, and families in Maine.   I offer testimony today in opposition to LD 662, which would prohibit a municipality from adopting or enforcing an ordinance prohibiting a tobacco retailer from selling flavored tobacco products. Across the United States, e-cigarettes are the most used tobacco product among US youth.1 The use of “flavors” to cover the harsh flavor of tobacco is attractive to teens. A national youth survey in 2022 found that 84.9% of youth who reported using e-cigarettes used flavored varieties. The most commonly used flavors were fruit (69.1%), candy, desserts, or other sweets (38.3%), mint (29.4%), and menthol (26.6%).2   We can look to data results from the 2021 Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey (MIYHS) for additional information from Maine students.3 Over 30 percent of MIYHS high school respondents said that they had tried an electronic vaping product and over 14 percent said they  1 Park-Lee E, Ren C, Cooper M, Cornelius M, Jamal A, Cullen KA.

But in reality, they serve as delivery devices for nicotine and or cannabis.  With decades of successful prevention work targeted to reduce the numbers of youth addicted to tobacco products, we can’t go backwards on the progress that has been made. More must be done to stop the upward trend in vaping among our youth. Maine has a long history of local control. Municipalities that wish to restrict the sale of flavored tobacco as a protective step to protect their children and address this public health issue should be prohibited to do so by state statute. Thank you for your consideration.
