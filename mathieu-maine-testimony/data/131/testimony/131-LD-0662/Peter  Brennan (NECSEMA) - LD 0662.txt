 RE: LD 662 An Act t o Prohibit Municipal Flavored Tobacco Product Bans on State -Licensed Tobacco 
Retailers  
 
Dear Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Maine Committee on State and  Local 
Government, 
 
As the Executive Director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers  
Association (NECSEMA), I am writing in support to the above -listed legislation regarding prohibiting 
municipal flavored tobacco bans.  
 
NECSEMA is a regional retail trade association representing the convenience stores and fuels marketers 
in New England. NECSEMA members own, operate and/or supply the majority of the 1,000+ 
convenience stores in Maine which employ over 16,000 people.  
 
In Massachusetts, we have seen firsthand the catastrophic effect  of flavor ed tobacco bans at the state and 
local level.  The facts, as illustrated through tax stamps monitored and compiled by state governments in 
New England, show how ineffective local bans are. In Massachusetts, the ban on the sale of menthol 
cigarettes and all other flavored tobacco products resulted in a total excise tax revenue loss of nearly $127 
million to the Commonwealth in the twelve months following enactment of the ban and, at the same time, 
provided a revenue boon to surrounding states. That excise tax loss to Massachusetts has only been 
exacerb ated since that time, while the illicit market had thrived. ( See MA Ille gal T obacco T ask F orce 
2023 Annual Report).  
 
Specifically, focusing on state cigarette excise tax revenue changes during this first twelve -month period, 
the results were reported as follows:  
 
State  Tax Paid Sales in 
Number of Packs of 
Cigarettes  Cigarette Excise Tax 
Revenue Change  Percent Change in 
Cigarette Excise Tax 
Revenue  
Massachusetts  -33,076,000 Packs  ($116,096,760)  - 23.9%  
New Hampshire  + 23,380,000 Packs  + $41,616,400  + 22.1%  
Rhode Island  + 5,355,000 Packs  + $22,758,750  + 18.0%  
Vermont  + 1,143,000 Packs  + 3,520,440  + 6.0%  
 

 
When changing the focus to the sale of menthol cigarettes during the first twelve months after the ban 
went into effect, menthol cigarette sales in Massachusetts went to zero, but menthol cigarette sales 
increased in New Hampshire by 78.5%, in Rhode Island by 42.5%, in Vermont by 10.5%, and in 
Connecticut by 4.1%. Moreover, sales increases continued in the 13- 24 months after the Massachusetts 
ban went into effect with New Hampshire menthol cigarette sales remaining 52.3% higher than the year 
before the ban,  Rhode Island 27.3% higher, and Vermont 3.4% higher. 
 
Since that time, the black market has continued to thrive, while contraband cigarette seizures in 
Massachusetts soared in 2022 (with little impact on smoking trends), while sales revenue dropped by an 
additional $7 million. Moving tobacco products out of the heavily regulated retail sales environment has 
been counterproductive. The ITTF report, cited above, found that contraband cigarette seizures by a joint 
task force made up of state police and the Dep artment of Revenue’s Criminal Investigations Bureau and 
Miscellaneous Excise Bureau skyrocketed from just 5,377 in 2021 to 18,483 in 2022. State police reported seizures soaring from just 40 packs in 2021 to more than 1,900 last year. In addition, seizures of 
illicit smokeless tobacco, which was also banned along with menthol, were up 800 percent in 2022. 
Menthol cigarettes and cigars made up the largest category of illicit tobacco seizures, the report states.  
 
It is already illegal in Maine for a person to purchase any tobacco product unless they are at least 21 years 
of age. This law is uphel d by our retailers who ensure that  underage buyers cannot legally purchase 
tobacco products at their stores . Retailers who violate this law, even unknowingly, are subject to hefty 
fines of “not less than $300 for the first offense, not less than $600 for the 2nd offense and not less than $1,000 for each offense thereafter, plus court costs”. Maine Revised Statutes T itle 22 , Chapter 262-A § 
1555-B : Sales of Tobacco Products . As illustrated in Massachusetts, b anning flavored tobacco products 
does not eliminate these products – it simply moves the products outside of the regulated marketplace.  
 
Passing LD 662 ensures that disastrous results like illustrated above are not permitted to continue. 
Patchwork regulation only creates winners and losers in business and fuels an illicit market.  
 
Consequently, I urge you to vote yes on LD 662. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  
 
      Sincerely,  
  
      Peter A. Brennan, Esq.
