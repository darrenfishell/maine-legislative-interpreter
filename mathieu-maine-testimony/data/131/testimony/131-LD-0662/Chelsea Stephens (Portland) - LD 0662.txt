Hello, 
Senator Nangle, representative Stover, and honorable members of the 
joint standing committee on state and local government; My name is 
Chelsea Stephens, I’m a resident of Portland and I’m here to testify in 
opposition of both LD 620 and LD 662. When it comes to standards 
for public health and safety, higher levels of government should set 
the minimum, not the maximum, for protecting its citizens. Municipal 
governments serve the purpose of providing quick, accessible, and 
specifically responsive action, and this is never more important than 
when it comes to issues of public health and safety. As I’m sure no 
one knows more than you all, the higher the level of government, the 
more time it takes to get something through. Local governments must 
be able to take swift action in response to serious threats to public 
health and safety while state governments work to find more 
comprehensive and broad solutions to the issue, just as states must 
be allowed to take action to address issues of particular concern in 
that state while the federal government seeks more broadly applicable 
action. Local ordinances restricting the sale of certain products are 
almost always for this purpose, and most often driven by the 
community itself in response to a serious problem in that community. 
There are rights of individuals which must be protected by higher 
levels of government from municipal restrictions; the right to make 
money on proven, extremely dangerous products, especially those 
which are marketed directly to children, is not one of those rights. But 
the right to have your voice heard in your own town or city on urgent 
matters of public safety is. Thank you for your time.
