Testimony in Support of LD 662,
“An Act to Prohibit
Municipal Flavored Tobacco
Product Bans on State-licensed Tobacco Retailers”
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on State and Local Government, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as
director of policy for Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a
nonpartisan, non-profit organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic
freedom in Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 662.
We commend Rep. Perry for submitting this bill, for seeing past the millions of
dollars in advertising from the California-funded and nationally-organized groups
pushing misguided and failing tobacco policy across the country, and in cities across
Maine. Their stated goal is a statewide ban; these local bans are merely a tactic to
desensitize voters in the population centers to accepting a statewide ban.
We need only look to our regional neighbor, Massachusetts, to find out just how
disastrous a statewide flavored tobacco ban would be here.
In 2019, Governor Charlie Baker signed into law a bill that instituted a ban on all
flavored tobacco products in the state and a new 75% tax on e-cigarettes. The state
Department of Revenue projected that, even with the extra tax, the ban would still cost
Massachusetts
$93 million
over the fiscal year.

The
ban went into effect that June.
In June 2020, a year after the ban, regional tobacco usage had not changed;
2
sales just moved across the border, primarily to low-tax New Hampshire.
3
The results
were substantially lower earnings for Massachusetts store owners and employees, and
nearly $127 million less in tax revenue in the first 12 months after the ban.

Proponents argue that stricter regulations on e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS), will keep them from falling into the hands of youth, but all
these policies do is keep legal products from consenting adults. The law already
prohibits providing these products to minors.

Many adults use these products to reduce the harm of their nicotine addiction. By
substituting ENDS for combustible cigarettes, users greatly reduce their risks for cancer
and other diseases arising from exposure to cigarette smoke. Flavors are an important
tool in helping adults to quit cigarettes. A
2019
NIH study
found that users who switch
from combustibles to ENDS are much more likely to “rate flavors as important to their
ENDS use.”

In reality, flavored e-cigarette restrictions are backfiring. They do not protect
youth from the dangerous health effects of tobacco use. An analysis from the National
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that “the health costs from greater youth
smoking as a result of e-cigarette taxes may undercut or even outweigh benefits from
reduced youth e-cigarette vaping.”
6
A study published in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA)
Pediatrics
found that a local flavored tobacco and
vape ban implemented in San
Francisco also did not work, and instead pushed youth to use traditional cigarettes.
7
In its 2023 Annual Report, Massachusetts State Multi-Agency Illegal Tobacco
Task Force noted that the ban has increased incentive for smugglers by increasing the
differences in cross-state tobacco regulations, leading to greater seizures and law
enforcement needs.
8
Mainers should expect to see these
same dynamics at play on the
local borders as well, should these California-inspired activists get their way.
Please deem LD 662 “Ought To Pass” and send a message that this Legislature
should embrace a philosophy of harm reduction instead of prohibition. Thank you for
your time and consideration.
