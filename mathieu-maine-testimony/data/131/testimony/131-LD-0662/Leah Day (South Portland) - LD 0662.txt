Dear members of the Committee On State and Local Government: 
My name is Leah Day, I’m the owner of Lighthouse Bikes in South Portland and a 
resident of Peaks Island. I’m writing in opposition to LD 620 and LD 662, which 
would prevent municipalities from passing laws to protect their communities from 
threats to their health and well-being.
A few months ago I urged South Portland’s city council to end the sale of flavored 
tobacco products, and thankfully they passed an ordinance to that effect. As a 
business owner and parent, I’ve seen firsthand how flavored tobacco products attract 
and hook kids into a potentially life-long struggle with tobacco addiction. My son was
fifteen years old when he started using flavored e-cigarettes, and quickly became so 
addicted that he was hospitalized for more than a week. The experience not only 
derailed his life, I also had to shut down my business early in the season as a result. 
If LD 620 and LD 662 were to pass, municipalities wouldn’t be able to lead on public 
health issues like addressing youth tobacco use, or set the stage for more robust action
at the state level. 
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 620 and LD 662.
