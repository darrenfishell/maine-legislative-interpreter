Dear members of the Committee On State and Local Government: 
My name is Anthony Allen and I’m co-owner of OTTO’s Pizza, a company that employs 300 
people in Maine at locations across the state. I oppose LD 620 and LD 662 because I think it’s 
critical for municipalities to be able to pass local policies that promote a healthy workforce for 
their communities.
Such policies include ending the sale of flavored tobacco products. Here’s an excerpt from an 
opinion editorial I co-wrote for the Portland Press Herald that sums up why I support those 
efforts: 
“Building a community-oriented brand like OTTO’s Pizza means valuing customers’ 
experiences. Having staff outside the entryways smoking, or reeking of smoke inside while they 
interact with people, turns customers off. Hiring smokers also means having to lean on other 
employees to cover smoke breaks, and fill in when smokers are out sick because people who 
smoke are generally less healthy and miss more work than non-smokers. The problem isn’t 
unique to Otto; it cuts across the service industry, construction and manufacturing. According to 
the Maine CDC, smoking costs Maine’s economy nearly $1.5 billion a year in associated 
healthcare costs and lost productivity. Tobacco addiction is a scourge on peoples’ health, and 
its consequences present one more challenge to finding reliable staff in a chaotic labor market.”
Ending the sale of flavored tobacco products will help reduce youth tobacco use, which means 
once those young people enter the workforce they will be healthier and more productive 
employees.
Please vote ought not to pass on LD 620 and LD 662. 
Anthony Allen, 
Co-owner, OTTO’s Pizza
