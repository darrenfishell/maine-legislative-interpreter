In Opposition to  
LD 1 699 - An Act to Amend the Freedom of Access Act and Related Provisions  
April 26, 2023 
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen and members of the Judiciary Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, 
and I am providing testimony in opposition to LD 1 699 on behalf of the Maine Muni cipal Association’s 
(MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction 
to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Local leaders take responding to Freedom o f Information requests very seriously. There is concern 
among municipalities that this would limit the response time to no more tha n 60 days and further require 
a written acknowledgement of an extension granted by the Public Access Ombudsman. Quite often  60 
days is not long enough to fulfill the request and adding an additional step to be granted an extension 
would just slow the process down further.  
Municipalities across Maine benefit from being a member of MMA. Membership includes access 
to MMA’s risk management services and health trust insurance programs. These are self -funded programs 
that provide affordable insurance needs for health insurance, property & casualty insurance, workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance.  
Our organization’s legal department provides several guidance document publications for a wide 
variety of local officials in addition to basic legal advice relating to topics such as ordinance writing, as one example. The legal team is not meant to take the place of a corporate attorney but can help provide clarity 
for certain things that would otherwise require a call to a lawyer for advice.  
The advocacy and communications arm create publications for our members like the Maine Town 
& City magazine, the Legislative Bulletin , and the Federal Issues Paper, that aim to provide our members 
with relevant information. In particular, the Federal Issues Paper is created annually as a guide for the annual discussion with our federal delegation members in March in conjunction with Hill Day of the 
National League of Cities, Congressional Cities Conference.  
The educational services department provides education and training opportunities for local 
officials and work with our affiliate group organizations to provide needed training educatio nal 
opportunities to keep our municipal staff up to date with current best practices and changes to law.  
As a service organization, these services are a benefit for our members . Although our members 
themselves are public bodies and the LPC recognizes that some communication with them is subject to FOIA requests, we remain opposed to the part of the bill that would add 501(c)(3) organizations subject to FOIA requests  and maintain that the organizational records do not fall under that purview.  
Thank  you for your time and for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
