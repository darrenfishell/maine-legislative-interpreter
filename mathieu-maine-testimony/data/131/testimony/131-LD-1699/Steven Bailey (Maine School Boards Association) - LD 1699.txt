TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO 
L D 1699 
AN ACT TO AMEND THE FREEDOM OF ACCESS ACT AND RELATED PROVISIONS 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen and members of the Iud1c1a1y Commlttee I am Steven Barley, 
executlve dlrector of Ma1ne School Management Assoclatlon, testlfylng on behalf of the leg1slat1ve 
commlttees of the Mame School Boards Assoclatlon and Ma1ne School Superlntendents Ass0c1at1on, 1n 
oppos1t1on to L D 1699 
The Freedom of Access Act 1s an 1mportant component of publ1c ent1t1es It helps prov1de for and allow for 
transparency 1n the conduct of these ent1t1es through the ava1lab1l1ty of pubhc records that are 1ncluded w1th1n 
the Act School d1str1cts have been a frequent rec1p1ent of these requests, especlally w1th1n the past two years 
These requests have been fulﬁlled as deemed approprlate through the dlstncts and after rev1ew, when 
appropr1ate, by the F OAA Ombudsman, Brenda K1elty 
L D 1699 seeks to create add1t1onal what we w1l1 call restr1ct1ons not currently 1n the Act The ﬁrst would 
lnclude the publ1c proceedlngs deﬁn1t1on to apply to nonproﬁt organ1zat1ons that qual1fy as a tax-exempt 
organlzatlon under 26 Un1ted States Code 50l(c)3 1f the organrzatlon recelves more than 50% of 1ts annual 
revenue from federal, state or mun1c1pal fundmg sources We questlon the slze and breadth of the group1ng of 
nonproﬁts Who does th1s 1nclude'? Is 1t the g1rl scouts, the YMCA, and all other nonproﬁt Board of D1rectors ‘7 
Is th1s the 1ntent‘7 Th1s does not seem clear here, nor 1s the reason stated as to why th1s 1s be1ng requested to be 
lncluded w1th1n th1s deﬁn1t1on pomon of the Act 
A second area of concem 1s the good falth est1mate of t1me when the request mlght be fulﬁlled along w1th the 
cost est1mate, 1n th1s case proposed to be 60 days from the t1me the request was recelved A request for an 
extens1on can be made to the Ombudsman Wh1le 60 days may appear to be a reasonable t1me to prov1de th1s 
est1mate, there are requests that have been recelved by school systems that have requ1red the need to search 
through tens of thousands of documents, based on conﬁdentlal student and med1cal 1nformat1on that may need 
to be redacted To determ1ne the est1mate of both t1me and cost may 1ndeed take more than 60 days, glven 
there are not employees of school d1str1cts h1red speclﬁcally and only to respond to FOAA requests Wh1le 
exceedmg 60 days may seem l1ke 1t could be the except1on, and an extens1on requested, that 1s one more step 
w1th whlch to comply Our pos1t1on 1s that we th1nk the law as 1t reads 1s more than adequate 1n prov1d1ng an 
est1mate of t1me and cost w1th1n a reasonable length of t1me from when the request was rece1ved 
The thlrd concem 1s the l1m1t placed on the total fee of $500 At $25 per hour, alter the ﬁrst two free hours, 
that allows for 20 hours of ded1cated t1me to fulﬁll the FOAA request as a max1mum 
Of greater concern 1s the l1m1t of $100 allowed to be charged to a s1ngle md1v1dual 1n response to all requests 
for publlc records subm1tted by the same person m a slngle calendar year Th1s l1m1tat1on appears to be 1n 
Steven W Ba1ley Elleen E Kmg MSBA Executlve Dlrector MSSA Execullve Duector
conﬂlct w1th the $500 l1m1t able to be charged by an agency or ofﬁclal “other than a school adm1n1strat1ve 
un1t ” And, 11m1t1ng the charge to a slngle person maklng these requests to $100 1s not reasonable or fa1r to 
taxpayers who are paymg for the tune and effort school admrnrstratlve staff are takmg to research, revlew, 
collate and make available the requested records In one d1str1ct alone, a slngle requester made 18 requests 
that requlred 34 75 hours to fulﬁll the multlple requests One request requlred 10 hours, another requlred 4 
hours The math doesn’t seem to add up, nor does the respons1b1l1ty of school staff that they have to conduct 
thelr typlcal operatlons of the school un1t, when bemg called away to fulﬁll these types of FOAA requests 
MSSA and MSBA both urge the Jud1c1ary Commrttee to vote ONTP on L D 1699
