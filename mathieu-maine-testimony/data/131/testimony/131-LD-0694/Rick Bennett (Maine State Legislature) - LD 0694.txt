THE MAINE SENATE 
13 l st Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Richard A. Bennett 
In Support of LD 694, "An Act to Lower the Signature Quantity Requirement for Certain 
Independent Candidates for Elected Office" 
8 March 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal 
Affairs, I am Senator Rick Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of serving I4 communities in 
Western Maine in the State Senate. I am pleased to cosponsor LD 694, An Act to Lower the 
Signature Quantity Requirement for Certain Independent Candidates for Elected Ofﬁce. 
This is a simple bill that lowers the number of signatures required for a nomination petition for 
an independent candidate. I believe this is a matter of fairness. The standards for ballot access 
should be uniform, regardless of party. Under current law, party candidates have many 
advantages built-in. The thresholds for independent candidacies are already high. They should 
not be further disadvantaged by the need to gather twice the number of signatures to qualify for 
the ballot.. 
Creating fairness in the system may encourage more independent candidates to enter political 
service. At a time when partisanship only seems to be increasing, I think we should make the 
path for independents less intimidating. 
Thank you.
