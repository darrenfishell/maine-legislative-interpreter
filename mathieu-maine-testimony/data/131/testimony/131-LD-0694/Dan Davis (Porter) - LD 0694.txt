LD 694
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee:
I am providing testimony in support of LD694 and LD769, and represent no entity or agency 
other than myself as a resident, property owner, taxpayer, and voter.
The two major corporations in Maine have enjoyed generations of advantage codified in 
statute that has disenfranchised a majority of this state, resulting in limited and ineffectual 
options for voters, a stagnation of ideas, partisan power struggling indifferent to the needs of 
Mainers, legislation through rule-making of unelected bodies reaching nauseating levels, and 
exponentially increasing ‘’concept drafts’’, a blank piece of paper, that portrays an attitude of 
aloofness and indifference to the legal right for the public to participate in their government 
and be given the opportunity to review well-thought out and crafted works.
LD341 and LD769 are a good start, but it is recommended that legislators do a deeper-dive 
and root out the codified relevance of political corporations in our statutes, laws that insert 
political corporations between the citizenry and their government without being asked, and 
without necessity.
Below are all the statutes that are structural barriers to participation here in Maine:
Title 1 §1002, Title 1 §1015, Title 5 §200-A , Title 5 §283-A , Title 5 §7056-A, Title 21-A §103, 
Title 21-A §142, Title 21-A §145, Title 21-A §156, Title 21-A §196-A , Title 21-A §722 1-A (B), 
21-A §723 1 (A), 21-A §1011, (21-A §1012 5(A), 2(B) (5,6,7), 3(B) (1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 10A)), 21-A 
§1013-A, Title 21-A §1014-B , 21-A §1015, 21-A §1017 (7A), 21-A §1017-A (1 & 4A (E)), 
21-A §1020-A (5A), 21-A §1052-A (4), Title 21-A §1053-A, 21-A §1059 (E), Title 21-A §1101 
& §1105
I’d prefer that political corporation labels be stripped from every elected office and official and 
all structural advantages removed, because frankly I’ve lost faith in both corporations and the 
entire governmental system as a whole.
Most of the people in this state don’t even trust the two major corporations, or hold the same 
belief system, yet Mainers are forced to hold their nose and eat the cold plate. 
Folks who want to run independent quickly realize that all of the existing State laws are 
stacked against them, funneling these candidates to sign on to one these two political 
corporations from a by-gone era if they ever want the opportunity to serve.
I urge the Committee to vote Ought To Pass on LD685, vote Ought To Pass on LD769, and 
maybe even consider unenrolling to help restore integrity to Maine’s government.
Who knows, it may take only a few individuals here on the committee to lead, causing the 
revolution we need in restoring the public trust.
Thank you.
Dan
