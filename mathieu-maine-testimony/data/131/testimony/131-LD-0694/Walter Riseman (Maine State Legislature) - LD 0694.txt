Testimony of Rep. Walter Riseman introducing 
LD 694, An Act to Lower the Signature Quantity Requirement for Certain Independent 
Candidates for Elected Office 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Greetings Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and distinguished members of the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs Committee, my name is Walter Riseman, and I proudly represent House 
District 83, which consists of the towns of Harrison, Bridgton and Denmark. I am here to seek 
your support on LD 694, An Act to Lower the Signature Quantity Requirement for Certain 
Independent Candidates for Elected Ofﬁce. 
Our goal as a state should be to encourage as many citizens as possible to participate in the 
election process whether or not a person has a certain party preference. The Independent or 
Unenrolled voter makes up around 40% of the total registered voters, which is a substantial 
portion of the voting base. However, the Independent or Unenrolled voter is put at a distinct 
disadvantage when it comes to gathering signatures for nomination petitions to run for ofﬁce. 
The requirement for the minimum number of signatures for an Independent is twice that ofa 
person in an “organized ” party. The current requirements are below and broken down by 
party.

This bill is designed to bring equity and fairness to the election process by recognizing the 
Unenrolled voter is at a distinct disadvantage when considering or not to run for a public 
ofﬁce. Quite often they don’t have substantial resources that party candidates have in making 
a run for ofﬁce. 
The premise is simple, let’s put potential candidates on the same playing ﬁeld with each other. 
If we Want to encourage more public participation in the election system, let’s start by giving 
LD 694 a unanimous “Ought to Pass” report. Thank you and if you have any questions, I. 
would be happy to answer them. 
District 83: Bridgton, Harrison, Demark
