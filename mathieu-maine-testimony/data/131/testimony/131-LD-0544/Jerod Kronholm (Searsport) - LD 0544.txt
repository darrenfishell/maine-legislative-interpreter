Fish and wildlife committee: 
My name is Jerod Kronholm, I am a registered Maine guide and co-operate Big 
Mountain Outfitters. 
I am writing in opposition of this bill. While I am very thankful to the men and women who 
have served or currently serve in our armed forces, I am also thankful of many other 
professions in which keep our day to day lives moving forward. Maine currently has programs
in place to give additional opportunities for vets in our moose hunt.
I am also concerned this adds further confusion and complication to the moose lottery as it 
would take considerable time each year for verification of military status. 
Thank you for your time.
