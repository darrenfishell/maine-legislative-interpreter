RE:
LD
1706,
An
Act
to
Clarify
Statewide
Laws
Regarding
Affordable
Housing
and
Accessory
Dwelling
Units
Dear
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
“neither
for ,
nor
against”
LD
1706,
An
Act
to
Clarify
Statewide
Laws
Regarding
Af fordable
Housing
and
Accessory
Dwelling
Units,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Since
1843,
Maine
Audubon
has
worked
to
conserve
Maine’ s
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
by
engaging
people
in
education,
conservation,
and
action.
The
oldest
and
lar gest
Maine-based
conservation
or ganization,
Maine
Audubon
has
eight
public
centers
and
sanctuaries
across
the
state,
seven
chapters,
and
connects
with
more
than
250,000
people
annually .
Maine
Audubon
supports
the
intent
of
this
legislation:
T o
clarify
existing
law
regarding
af fordable
housing
development
and
accessory
dwelling
units
(ADUs)
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
increased
af fordable
housing
development
and
housing
availability ,
generally .
As
part
of
the
Maine
community ,
we
desire
to
see
our
neighbors
thrive.
Af fordable
and
accessible
housing
is
a
cornerstone
of
a
thriving
community .
As
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
advocates,
we
seek
and
support
housing
policy
that
does
not
unduly
impact
Maine’ s
natural
resources
–
from
lakes,
rivers,
and
streams
that
provide
clean
drinking
water ,
to
habitats
that
are
critical
to
preserving
biodiversity ,
upon
which
all
life
depends.
W ith
this
in
mind,
we
of fer
the
following
comments
on
LD
1706:
●
W e
ar e
concerned
that
Section
12
would
undermine
shor eland
zoning
goals.
The
Maine
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
established
shoreland
zoning
requirements
in
order
to
prevent
and
control
water
pollution;
protect
wildlife
habitat,
including
wetlands;
and
protect
buildings
and
lands
from
flooding
and
accelerated
erosion,
among
other
purposes.
Shoreland
zoning
requirements
include
limitations
on
the
expansion
of
or
other
modifications
to
nonconforming
structures
in
the
shoreland
zone,
including
ADUs,
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
impact
of
structures
that
pre-date
shoreland
zoning
requirements
on
Maine
waters
and
waterways.

LD
1706
would
amend
existing
statute
to
exempt
non-conforming
ADUs
(as
well
as
conforming
units)
from
“density
requirements
or
calculations
related
to
the
area
in
which
the
accessory
dwelling
unit
is
constructed”.
It
is
our
understanding
that
this
would
allow
ADUs
located
in
the
shoreland
zone
to
expand
beyond
the
limitations
currently
in
place
and,
as
a
result,
unduly
impact
Maine
waters
and
waterways,
including
public
drinking
water
supplies
and
other
natural
resource
values
that
provide
community
benefits.
W e
strongly
ur ge
the
Committee
to
consider
an
amendment
that
would
maintain
“density
requirements
or
calculations
related
to
the
area
in
which
the
accessory
dwelling
unit
is
constructed”
for
ADUs
that
do
not
conform
with
shoreland
zoning
requirements.
●
W e
r ecommend
narr owing
the
pr oposed
language
in
Section
9.
Section
9
would
allow
for
ADUs
on
lots
that
do
not
conform
to
a
municipal
zoning
ordinance
if
the
ADU
does
not
“further
increase
the
nonconformity .”
Nonconforming
lots
are
such
for
a
wide
variety
of
reasons,
including
minimum
lot
size
requirements,
a
residential
lot
in
a
commercial
district,
etc.
Nonconforming
lots
might
also
not
conform
with
shoreland
zoning
requirements.
In
those
instances,
we
do
not
believe
that
an
ADU
should
be
allowed
on
the
lot,
because
such
development
would
undermine
the
shoreland
zoning
goals
described
above.
W e
encourage
the
Committee
to
narrow
the
proposed
language
in
Section
9.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
W e
welcome
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
ef forts
to
improve
this
important
bill.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
