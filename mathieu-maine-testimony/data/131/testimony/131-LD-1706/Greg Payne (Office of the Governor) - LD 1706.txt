Testimony In Support Of 
L.D. 1706, An Act to Clarify Statewide Laws Regarding Affordable Housing and Accessory 
Dwelling Units 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and distinguished members of the Joint Select Committee 
on Housing, my name is Greg Payne and I serve as the Senior Advisor on Housing Policy in the 
Governor ’s Ofﬁce of Policy Innovation and the Future. I am here today to offer testimony in 
support of L.D. 1706, An Act to Clarify Statewide Laws Regarding Affordable Housing and 
Accessory Dwelling Units. 
Last year, bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate passed L.D. 2003. This landmark law 
reduces zoning and land use restrictions that often discourage or outright prohibit individual 
homeowners and developers from building more homes for Mainers in every corner of our state. 
The major provisions in that law, as the committee knows, will take effect on July I, 2023. 
Over the last several months, the Department of Economic and Community Development 
(DECD) has proposed and published rules as authorized by the enacting legislation. That process 
included a 30-day comment period and a public hearing, after which DECD reviewed and 
responded to each comment. The proposed rules were then revised based on comments submitted 
by the public. However, over the past year a small number of additional issues have been raised 
which require clariﬁcations that can only be made through changes to the statute. 
L.D. I706 proposes several statutory changes to provide clarity on a number of items that were 
not made explicitly clear in L.D. 2003 itself. This includes making clear that accessory dwelling 
units (ADUs) are allowed in a town’s shoreland zone. In other words, the town cannot adopta 
blanket prohibition of ADUs in the shoreland. However, this does not necessarily mean that all 
proposed ADUs in the shoreland will get approval, because they are still required to meet the 
other conditions laid out in local shoreland ordinances. We would like to work with the 
Committee and the bill’s sponsor on some minor wording changes regarding this provision, but 
agree with what we believe is its intent. L.D. I706 also provides clarity concerning non- 
conforming lots, how affordable units are designated under the density bonus provision, and 
approval for ADUs by permit rather than planning board review. 
These are simple and straightforward changes. L.D. I706 addresses areas of L.D. 2003 that 
require clarity to ensure the law is evenly applied across jurisdictions. Thank you for 
consideration and I’d be happy to answer any questions.
