LD 1706
I am writing in Support of Bill LD 1706.   I am a long time resident of Rockland, 
Maine, a small coastal community of just over 7,000.  The need for additional 
workforce housing  is strong yet seems to be mired in this NIMBY (not in my back 
yard) attitude that so often persists in many communities throughout the State.  
Municipalities are hindered by regulations that restrict the ability of individuals and 
developers to go forward with projects that will provide additional affordable 
housing.  I have approached the city to create accessory dwellings on my in-town 
property to provide two additional apartments, yet I am told that I must go before the 
planning board for approval.  This would impose additional costs and delays that 
would in effect not allow me to go forward with this project.  If we as a state are to go
forward in creating more affordable opportunities for individuals to live where they 
work, then we must act to remove the strangle hold local communities are imposing 
that stand in the way.
Thank you for listening.
