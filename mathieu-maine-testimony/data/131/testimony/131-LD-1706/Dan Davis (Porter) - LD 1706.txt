 
 Senator Pierce , Representative  Gere , and members of the Housing Committee , 
 
I represent no entity or agency other than myself and would like to testify in OPPOSITION  to LD1706 and 
LD1593 . 
LD1706  will further complicate efforts for communities as they frantically attempt to understand what the 
law means right now, and while still asking that the State address  all of the gaps and ambiguity in statute or 
rules (which it has not  yet done ). This bil l introduces even more  unfunded  labor and cost burdens on 
municipalities than LD2003 has already incurred , further undermines subdivision law, a llows development 
first then government review  later  which is extremely reckless (‘’after -the-fact’’), and undermines life/fire 
safety.  
LD1593  is construed as a disingenuous approach to further State overreach and to induce more 
development in to many portions of Maine who do not have the capability or capacity to properly manag e 
it. It also conflicts with numerous State Laws  and manipulates the small lot law that towns are currently 
validating their local designs against, and the law that is a foundation of LD2003.  
As LD2003 was being developed, community local governments have  consiste ntly sought to gain a  mutual 
agreement by all stakeholders that maintains local control while encouraging affordable housing that is 
within the capabilities, capacity, and comprehensive planning of diverse political subdivisions throughout 
the State. This has not occurred  and there is a feeling by smaller communities , roughly 70% of this state,  of 
disenfranchisement and an overall sense of a tone -deaf administration  making emotional decisions rather 
than applying common -sense and reason .  
Even today, there are over 17 current legislative documents revolving around increasing housing 
affordabil ity; five (5) that are ‘’placeholders ’’ for ideas the legislators have yet to come up with, six (6) that 
undermine the quality and service of the Tree Growth Program, the MEDEP, LURC, and local governments , 
and six (6) that are actively manipulating the LD2003  public law ( Chapter 672 ) which is still 
disproportionate , incomplete , comes with an unknown and un funded price  tag, and continues to be a 
moving target law that towns have to somehow comply with in the next two months . 
There are current attempts to add reasonableness, proportionality, and competency to LD2003 ( LD214,  
and LD1154 ), to address a significant blind  spot in the law that will negatively affect our environment and 
natural resources ( LD54 ), and to rationally delay rolling out an incomplete law that wil l likely result in 
extended court testing by municipalities due to its lack of quality  (LD665 ). LD2003  was passed through by 
the legislature  without full understanding of its impacts, without carrying the true costs that are fully 
considered , finalized , or approved , and without proper complet ion to be able to stand in a court of law.  
The law that LD1706 and LD1593 attempts to continue to ba ndaid and bolt -on has s ubstantive conflicts 
with the existing State legal construct ( at least 21 statutes ) and rights and obligations codified in our state 
constitution ( 5 sections across 6 articles ), putting into question validity of LD2003.  
Legislators are still being educated on what LD2003 does, the DECD supposedly  claims to have  finalized 
rules for LD2003  (Chapter Law 672 ) just this  April 2023  (but it hasn’t) , the DECD is still having training 
sessions for local governments  up to the end of May 2023 , legislator s are even indicating to their 
constituents that LD2003 was n ever  a mandate, but guidance , very large cities are still not even close to 
being ready for this law enactment just a couple months from now , municipalities don ’t know how or if 
 
 they ’ll ever receive  funding for the work they are doing to complete LD2003 for the State, and there 
continues to be missing, ambiguous, and conflict ing definition s. 
Based on ‘’final’’ rule -making of Chapter 4 and the DECD summary of inquiries from various municipalities 
regarding LD2003 , roughly 50% of the DECD responses to eleven (11) unique questions indicate  that the  
rules  are incomplete and that  details on how grant proposals, target metrics, allowable uses, and scoring 
criterion will be determined for those seeking funding  are stilling being fleshed out . Towns need and rely 
on these  grants now, and they don’t have the information available to them to make informed and 
responsible decisions, and their property tax payers are not  responsible for  completing the unfinished work 
of state legislators  with their  legal counsel or testing unreasonable and ambiguous  legislation in court.  
Based  on ‘’final’’ rule -making of Chapter 5 and a DECD summary of inquiries from various municipalities 
regarding LD2003, a significant number of DECD responses (roughly 40%) to 132 unique questions ( there 
were 53 redunda nt questions in the survey ) either indicated that the legislature is responsible for  correct ing 
the flaws within with law, that municipalities will largely be responsible for hiring legal counsel to interpret, 
complete, and court test the significant ambiguity, conflicts, omissions, legality, and constitutionality of 
LD2003 , and that rulemaking is incomp lete in both chapters, even referring several Chapter 5 grant funding 
questions to an incomplete Chapter 4 rule.  
Not acknowledg ing that a majority of municipalities in this state  do not have public sidewalks, public 
parking, public transit, cohesive community servic es, police, local government staffing, or the tax base to 
support this unfunded and unreasonable mandate as it has been written  is unbecoming of both the 
legislature and the governor.  
Funding alone for this  unreaso nable and  incomplete mandate (municipalities being forced to court test and 
to hire independent lawyers to design and complete this law FOR the legislature ) has not been properly 
provided by the State  as is required by our State Constitution , and  even if a dequate funding were available, 
it is still  unattainable as the details , proposal  requirements , target metrics, allowable uses, and scoring 
criterion have not yet been completed  per the DECD, and the State has not yet even defined what the goal 
of LD2003 actually is . 
It is well documented  that t he rules and the LD2003 law remain substantively incomplete and ambiguous  
even two  months leading up to a state -wide roll-out, with serious missing foundational requirements to 
stand in a court of law . LD2003 remains contrary  to the standards of conduct furnished by the laws  and the 
constitution of this State  (lex iniusta non est lex ). 
I urge the Committee to start listening, work ing with , and respecting  the broad range of communities 
throughout the state  to assure that LD2003  is reasonable , proportionate, and does not conflict with the 
existing legislative construct . LD2003  and current bills like these  (LD1706, LD1593 ) will cause the same 
detrimental issues  here in Maine  that justified crea tion of  the very Subdivision Law  that the State is  
currently attempting to now dismantle .  
Please vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS  on LD1706 /LD1593  to allow Maine centralized planning to grow in a  
more  orderly and sensible manner , thereby protect ing our environment , natural resources,  and climate.  
Thank you .
