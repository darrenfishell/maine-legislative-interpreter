Gregory R. Mineo 
Director, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
 
LD 846, An Act to Require Direct Wine Shippers to Comply with Maine Beverage Containers Law 
  
March 15, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, my name is Gregg Mineo and I am the Director of the Bureau of 
Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. I am providing the following written testimony in 
support of LD 846. 
 
This legislation would require that all wine shipments into Maine have bottle redemption affixed 
to the container and comply with all laws associated with the beverage container laws. This was an underlying topic during stake holder meetings that focused on direct to consumer and alcohol by volume standards, but there seemed to be agreement about the problem, as well as the solution.  
 Thank you for considering our written testimony. BABLO will defer to the Department of 
Environmental Protection on this subject, as they administer Maine’s beverage container laws, 
but can  be available for the work session upon the Committee’s request.
