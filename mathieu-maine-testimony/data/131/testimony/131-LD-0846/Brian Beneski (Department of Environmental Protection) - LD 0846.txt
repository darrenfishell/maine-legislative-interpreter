LD 846 - An Act to Require Direct Wine Shippers to Comply with Maine Beverage Container Laws

a refund value for beverage container control purposes. This provides an uneven 
playing field for Maine based retailers and distributors of wine products who are 
required to participate in the bottle redemption program. In order for Maine distributers 
to sell wine in the state, they must become an “initiator of deposit” , which requires 
registering with the Department, registering each individual wine label, initiating the 15- 
cent deposit, and arranging for a pick-up agent (if they elect not to be their own) to 
collect their wine containers from redemption centers, and paying the handling fee and 
pick up agent for their services. As direct to consumer wines are specifically exempt, 
out of state shippers of wine not subject to these same costs and labor. 
Many of these DTC wine containers end up being taken to redemption centers out of 
habit as Maine consumers are accustomed to the 15-cent deposit on wines sold in the 
State. There are approximately 21,300 different wine labels registered with the 
Department. Due to the sheer number of labels and containers that are received, a 
redemption center will often provide a deposit refund to a customer initially assuming it’s 
a valid redemption and sort containers later, and then realize during sorting that the 
wine was not registered. The redemption center must then “eat” the deposit provided to 
the customer. Although not legal, the redemption center may put the bottle in with other 
wine bottles associated with a local distributer to get a deposit back, along with the 
handling fee. Any wine container without a deposit that is mingled in with a local 
distributor's containers will cost that local distributer the 15-cent deposit and a 4.5-cent 
handling fee. Again, given the sheer number of different wine labels, this type of abuse 
is nearly impossible to detect. These wine bottles from out of state direct to consumer 
shippers are considered “free riders” in the bottle redemption system. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. l am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
