Testimony of Chris  Glynn, EDP Renewables North America  
 
In Sup port of  L.D. 1943, An Act Regarding Future Energy Procurements for Renewable 
Energy Development in Northern Maine  
 
Committee on Ener gy, Utilities, and Techn ology  
May 23, 2023  
 
Good  afternoon  Senator  Lawrence, Representa tive Zeigler , and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy , Utilities , and Technology . My name is  Chris Glynn —I’m fr om Rumford,  
curre ntly a South Portland resident , and speaking t oday on behal f of EDP Re newables North 
Americ a (EDP ). 
 
EDP  encourages this committee, and this legislature, to  pass L.D. 1943 , An Act Regarding 
Future Energy Procurements for Renewable Energy Development in Northern Maine  and 
fill the Northern Maine  transmission line that was  approved in 2021.  
 
EDP  is the fourth -largest owner and operator of wind energy in the United States and around the  
world , with 58 operating wind farms and 10 solar parks across North America . EDP  started  
initial development efforts in Maine in the County about 20 years ago —signing leases with 
landowners and testing  wind speeds.  Since then, we have developed a top -notch project , the 
Number Nine Wind Farm . It’s a mature, advanced -stage pro ject that’s been waiting for  the 
infrastructure  to support getting its power to market.  
 
We supported Sen ator Jackson ’s legis lation  to establ ish the Northern Maine R enewable Energy 
Development Program , and we remain  eager to help Maine tap into its valuable wind energy 
resources, among the best in the eas tern United States . L.D. 1943 will help our state do just that.  
 
The e conomic case for  procuring  the available 200 MW le ft to be filled on the No rthern Maine 
line is fairly straight forward : 
 
• Maine currently spends roughly $4.4 billion annually on imported fossil fuels1. 
Renewable  solutions  like this bill can help keep those energy dollars  here at home.  
• A fully loaded  1,200 MW line would crea te a market -wide pr ice suppression effect  in 
Maine and New England, sav ing Mainers $373  million over a 20 year cont ract ter m2. 
• Consumers would pay less per kwh if we f ill the line than if we leave it only eighty 
percent f ull. 
• Rate-payers are going to pay for a 1,200 MW line —they should simply be getting what 
they pay for.  
 
I understand how m uch work this committee has taken up in recent years  regarding  electricity, 
transmission, and the power sector of our economy.  I don’t have to tell you all how challen ging

it can be  to balance these issues and t heir various impacts —you live it every day. But  filling  this 
final 200 M W of the Northern Maine  line is a slam dunk.  It gets us another step closer to ward  
our c limat e goals, invests in renewable  generation in Northern Maine —within our own 
borders —and makes financial sense for rat e payers and ta x payers.  
 
Most of us don ’t have to go too far from our front doors to e njoy the na tural resour ces Maine has 
been bless ed with . Those reso urces bring joy to our lives and are at the heart of our economy . 
But it’s time we start thinking about  the wind that blows in the  County,  on cold w inter nights and  
on cloudy afternoons , as a differ ent kind of natural resource contributor to ou r economy.  One 
that can  create  jobs and bring new opportunities to areas of the state that are in need . Northern 
Main e has the best wind energy resource in New England , it has the available land, and 
suppor tive landowners . There is a growing demand in Maine and New England for more clean 
energy and the County  is perfectly positioned to deliver it, and  the people who live  there —who 
are at the heart and soul of our stat e—will get to realize many of the economic b enefits.  
 
I encourage t he committee to pass L .D. 1943, to procure these 20 0 MW, and f ully realize the 
potential of the Northern Maine  Renewable E nergy Development Program.  
 
Thank you.
