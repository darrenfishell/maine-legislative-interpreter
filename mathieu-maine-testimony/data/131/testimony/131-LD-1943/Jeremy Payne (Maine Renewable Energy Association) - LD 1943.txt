Re: Testimony in support of LD 1943, “An Act Regarding Future Energy Procurements for 
Renewable Energy Development in Northern Maine” 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Committee: 
My name is Jeremy Payne and I am a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs Group 
here to testify in support of LD 1943 on behalf of our client the Maine Renewable Energy 
Association (“MREA”). 
This legislation tasks the Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) with administering a clean 
energy procurement bid process to contract for no less than 750,000 megawatt-hours per year— 
we believe this will amount to approximately 200 megawatts being placed under contract. 
Importantly, this procurement will help make the Aroostook transmission line (LD 924) fully 
subscribed. As this committee knows, the PUC has approved term sheets for the l,200MW 
transmission line and a l,000MW wind farm (King Pine), which likely leaves capacity for an 
additional 20OMW of clean energy. 
We do have some questions as to how the PUC would consider a few of the bid consideration 
criteria. Speciﬁcally, we are not clear what is meant in 3-A-C-2-b and c ~ what would the PUC 
do to determine whether a bidder has “signiﬁcant experience in the successful completion of 
renewable energy projects similar to that proposal ”? What is meant by ‘signiﬁcant experience ’? 
And we would like to better understand how the PUC would implement “diversifying bidder 
selection and economic development opportunities in northern Maine.” 
Overall, we believe this legislation is an important next step in continuing to unlock the 
tremendous potential of clean energy in Aroostook County. And that placing additional clean 
energy projects under long-term contract will help shield Maine consumers in the future from 
wild price swings associated with natural gas. 
We respectfully urge you to vote ought to pass. 
Thankyou.
