Re: LD 1943  ‘An Act Regarding Future Energy Procurements for Renewable Energy Development in 
Northern Maine’  
 
Dear Chairs and Members of t he Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology,  
  
I represent the Aroostook Partnership, a unique private -public partnership of nearly 100 businesses, the 
Northern Maine Development Commission and the four colleges in Aroostook County. The mission of 
the Partnership is, essentially, to grow Aroostook Coun ty’s economy and support our residents, 
communities, and our quality of life.  
  
The Aroostook Partnership supports LD 1943,  which will bring significant economic benefits to the 
people and businesses of Aroostook County. This bill would enable even furthe r development of 
renewable energy projects in Northern Maine while also making the best  and fullest  use of the new 
transmission line to be built under the project created by LD 1710 from the 130th legislature. More jobs, 
tax revenues and local economic ben efits from the developers is a win for Aroostook and the state of 
Maine.  
 
Importantly, LD 1943 will also help accomplish the state’s clean energy goals in a cost -effective manner. 
On a per kilowatt -hour basis, wind energy was less expensive than the averag e ISO -NE market clearing 
price for all of 2022. Wind farms generate power during winter months, when the price of natural gas 
generation is at its highest. Moreover, because the Public Utilities Commission has already approved the 
transmission line needed to bring the initial 1,000 megawatts of wind energy to market, it makes 
economic sense to fill the line to its full capacity to lower the net cost to Maine ratepayers.  
 
The Aroostook Partnership further appreciates this bill’s support from both Senate Pres ident Jackson and 
Senator Stewart, among others. This bipartisan support underscores LD 1943’s common sense nature, 
particularly when it is expected this will  lower costs to Maine ratepayers  when rate relief is much needed .   
 
Respectfully,  
  
  
Paul Towle
