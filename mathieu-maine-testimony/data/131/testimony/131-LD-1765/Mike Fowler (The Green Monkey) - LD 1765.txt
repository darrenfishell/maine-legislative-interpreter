Good Day Ladies and Gentleman of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Mike Fowler. I am a patient, medical cannabis farmer and a member of the Maine Cannabis Union. 
Today l am testifying in opposition to LD# 1765, "An Act Authorizing the Governor to Enter into Interstate Agreements 
Regarding the Cannabis |ndustry" 
On April 10, 2023, John Hudak the Director of the Ofﬁce of Cannabis Policy submitted testimony for 
LD# 1391. Within that testimony he stated the following: 
"Maine is experiencing a healthy decline in the average price per gram of adult use cannabis ﬂower. 
What concerns us is that issues of oversupply have come on quickly in other states causing markets to collapse over 
the course of one or two fiscal quarters. As we have seen in states like Oregon, it can take years for cannabis 
economies to recover from the market shocks.'that provides thousands of jobs to Maine residents. 
l have the same sentimentsconcerning LD# 1765 as the Director of OCP. l guess there has to be a ﬁrst somewhere. 
This bill will allow multi-state operators an advantage over other Maine Cannabis businesses. Those within the 
medical cannabis industry are not able to expand their businesses, bank like a normal business, or even claim tax 
write-offs. Essentially, our hands are tied. 
The price of electricity, soil, nutrients, packaging, etc. are all rising exponentially. 
Currently there is no remedy to this situation. Unless everyone can afford and participate in an interstate cannabis 
program then there should be no interstate agreements. 
With that said, l ask you all to vote, "Ought Not to Pass“ on LD# 1765. 
Thank you for your time, 
Mike Fowler
