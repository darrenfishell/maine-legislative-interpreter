I’m just a simple gardener but didn’t this same government appointed OCP just 
recommend limiting licenses to “protect” the market? And now wants to open up the 
floodgates nationwide? 
Let’s just get LD1686 passed and free the plant and stop playing these games it is 
exhausting and ridiculous and we are all sickened by it. 
Cannabis is a harmless plant. One minute the government it demonizing it and the 
next it is squeezing hundreds of millions in taxes and regulations and supporting  ex 
police officers who otherwise would have to go out and get real jobs like the rest of 
us. 
Meanwhile we have an opioid epidemic legally created by pharmaceutical companies 
and no one’s harassing them. I am absolutely fed up with all these shenanigans. Hard 
pass on this bill.
