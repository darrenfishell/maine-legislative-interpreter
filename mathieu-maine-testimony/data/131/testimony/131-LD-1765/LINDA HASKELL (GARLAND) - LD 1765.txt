LD 1765
LD 1765 - An Act Authorizing the Governor to Enter into Interstate Agreements 
Regarding the Cannabis Industry 
Chairperson Supica, Senator Hickman and committee members. The Governor has all
she can do to stay abreast of our State of Maine economy now. Our economy is 
horrible, but throwing the State of Maine into Interstate Commercialized Cannabis 
Industry Agreements and appointing a Liaison is a huge jump to putting the health 
and welfare of Maine residents at risk. Drugs have become a killing force in this 
country and the State of Maine has drug traffic entering every day. We do not need 
this. LINDA HASKELL, OPPOSING LD1765
