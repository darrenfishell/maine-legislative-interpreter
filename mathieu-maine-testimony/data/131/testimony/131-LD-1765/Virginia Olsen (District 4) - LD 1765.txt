District 4-International Association of Machinist and 
Aerospace Workers 
 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and Honorable members of Veterans & Legal Affairs, 
My name is Virginia Olsen, I am from Stonington, Maine and I work for District 4 of the 
International Association of Machinist.  
We are opposed to LD 1765 “An Act Authorizing the Governor to Enter into Interstate 
Agreement Regarding the Cannabis Industry.” 
After hearing the Office of Cannabis Policy testify to the decline in the average price per gram, 
this bill is a conflict to that testimony.  While we can appreciate the states efforts to be 
prepared for a time when cannabis is legal federally, this bill is not the best vessel to get that 
job done. When Maine grows 11 metric tons and Colorado grows 632 metric tons it seems we 
may be importing more than we export.  This bill does nothing to help medical cannabis 
industry expand their businesses. We feel this would be better approached as a committee or 
task force to work through the implications both good and bad for the industry. A strategic plan 
for the cannabis industry in Maine. 
Respectfully, 
 
Virginia Olsen

I will try to participate over zoom without my camera- internet is very unstable with 
all the wind and rain today. I appologize.
Thank you!
