The K-12 public schools today are a disgrace. Teachers doing or telling kids what 
should or should not be done or said, and then telling them not to tell their parents. 
My wife and I have eight Granddaughters, all except one who was either home 
schooled or attended private schools. One is a psychiatrist who works at the VA in 
Portland, one who will complete her residency in June as an OD, one is a PA at 
Central Maine Hospital, one is a Teacher at a private school in Vermont, one is a 
traveling Nurse who has practiced in New Mexico, California, Montana and Maine 
and currently is in Colorado, one is a Counselor and recently opened a private practice
in Hallowell, and one recently graduated from the University of Maine in Orono as a 
Mechanical Engineer and was promptly interviewed and hired by a firm in Utah.
      These are examples why I support "Parents Choice" for their child's education. the
message should be fairly clear. Our Granddaughters' education was focused on 
academics with parental input and support.
