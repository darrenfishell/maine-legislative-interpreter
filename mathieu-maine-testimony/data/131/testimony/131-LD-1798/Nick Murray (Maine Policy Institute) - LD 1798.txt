Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LDs
1741,
1798,
1838,
1841,
1860.
A
nationwide
poll
of
more
than
2,500
parents
conducted
in
2022
found
that
more
than
20%
of
public
district
school
parents
are
either
“very
dissatisfied”
or
“somewhat
dissatisfied”
with
their
child’s
educational
experience.
Similarly,
about
20%
of
charter
school
parents
and
15%
of
private
school
parents
feel
the
same
way.
1
Clearly,
families
are
craving
more
options.
No
matter
what
the
ultimate
form
education
takes
for
each
child,
whether
a
traditional
district
school,
a
private
school,
public
charter
school,
homeschool,
or
something
different,
more
choices
will
lead
to
more
satisfied
parents
and
more
empowered
youth.
Choice
allows
education
tax
dollars
to
be
spent
in
the
most
effective
way
possible.
Instead
of
being
budgeted
through
opaque
local
school
board
processes
to
school
buildings
and
fixed-cost
bylines,
students’
education
funds
will
be
directed
by
those
closest
to
them,
who
know
them
best.
It
shouldn’t
have
to
be
said,
but
in
this
day
and
age,
it
does:
children
belong
to
their
parents,
not
to
their
ZIP
code-defined
public
school
district.
Various
programs
which
allow
families
to
direct
where
their
child’s
education
dollars
are
spent—like
a
tax-credit
scholarship
as
proposed
in
LD
1741,
or
an
education
savings
account
(ESA)
as
proposed
in
LDs
1798,
1838,
1841,
and
1860—can
bring
immense
benefit
to
a
student’s
academic
career.
Both
programs
allow
for
funding

support

regardless
of
whether
in
a
public,
private,
or
non-traditional
learning
environment.
2
The
effects
of
these
two
types
of
programs
are
very
similar,
though
they
can
be
structured
differently.
Tax-credit
scholarships
allow
taxpayers
(individuals
and
businesses)
to
receive
full
or
partial
credit
from
donations
to
nonprofits
which
provide
private
school
scholarships.
Today,
21
states
offer
some
form
of
tax-credit
scholarship
program,
within
which
more
than
312,000
students
take
part.
A
student
with
an
ESA
receives
a
portion
of
their
slice
of
per-pupil
funding,
usually
just
from
the
state
level,
which
is
then
loaded
into
a
debit
card
which
parents
may
use
to
fund
any
part
of
their
child’s
education.
The
state
audits
the
transactions
of
the
accounts
to
prevent
fraud.
As
of
the
2023
school
year,
there
are
more
than
63,000
students
making
use
of
ESAs
across
11
states.
3
Arizona
became
the
first
state
in
the
country
to
implement
an
Education
Savings
Account
(ESA)
program
in
2011.
Last
year,
Arizona
expanded
its
ESA
program
to
serve
any
student
in
the
state.
In
just
the
first
year
under
expansion,
the
number
of
students
utilizing
the
increased
flexibility
ESAs
offer
exploded,
from
about
12,000
in
2022
to
more
than
30,000
in
2023.
4
While
some
express
concern
that
choice
programs
like
ESAs
divert
funding
from
public
schools,
this
concern
has
not
borne
out
in
reality.
Since
the
establishment
of
Arizona’s
ESA
program,
per-pupil
public
school
funding,
adjusted
for
inflation,
has
continually
increased.
5
In
fact,
usage
of
ESAs
is
directly
responsible
for
increasing
the
per-pupil
funds
available
to
students
in
the
public
school
system.
In
FY
2019,
for
every
ESA
participant,
local
public
schools
received
$654,
meaning
that
more
than
$4.2
million
in
additional
funding
was
made
available
to
support
public
school
students
as
a
result
of
the
state’s
ESA
program.
6
The
ESA-like
programs
proposed
in
this
hearing
would
function
similarly.
Because
each
proposal
would
dedicate
only
a
portion
(either
half,
or
90%
of
the
state
share)
of
the
average
statewide
per-pupil
cost
to
each
ESA,
there
would
naturally
be
considerable
savings
left
over
from
each
enrollee.
This
means
that
each
enrollees’
home
district
would
keep
some
of
the
enrollee’s
per-pupil
cost
and
use
it
to
serve
a
smaller

number
of

As
they
have
in
Arizona,
ESAs
in
Maine
would
allow
local
public
districts
to
increase
their
per-pupil
spending
with
each
successive
enrollee.
The
benefits
of
school
choice
cannot
be
overstated.
To
date,
there
have
been
16
random
assignment
studies,
the
gold
standard
of
empirical
research,
on
how
educational
choice
affects
student
academic
achievement.
Of
those
16,
10
studies
found
statistically
significant
positive
effects
for
participating
students,
while
just
two
found
negative
effects,
and
four
found
neutral
effects.
7
Choice
helps
families
and
raises
student
outcomes.
ESAs
and
tax-credit
scholarship
programs
are
not
the
only
way
to
empower
families
to
choose
the
best
educational
option
for
them,
and
allow
them
to
pursue
academic
excellence.
A
2017
analysis
by
the
left-wing
Center
for
American
Progress
found
that
“high-quality
and
accountable
charters
are
successfully
improving
student
achievement
and closing
the
opportunity
gap for
low-income
students
of
color
through
innovation
within
the
public
education
system.”
8
Students
who
attend
charter
schools
are
noted
to
be
more
productive,
well-rounded,
community-minded,
and
better
able
to
contribute
as
skilled
workers—which
are
desperately
needed
in
Maine.
9
Charter
schools
in
Maine
are
held
back
by
unnecessary
restrictions
despite
their
demonstrated
success
and
capacity
to
improve
educational
outcomes,
particularly
among
special
needs,
poor
and
disadvantaged
students.
The
permanent
cap
on
the
number
of
charter
schools
that
can
operate
in
Maine
is
nonsensical
and
limits
even
the
publicly-available
options
students
have,
outside
of
the
teachers’
union-run,
government
school
system.
LD
1741
would
also
cure
this
problem
with
Maine’s
educational
offerings.
Please
deem
LDs
1741,
1798,
1838,
1841,
and
1860
“Ought
To
Pass”
so
that
funding
follows
students,
not
opaque
school
systems
which
take
their
enrolled
students
for
granted.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
