Testimony in Opposition to All Five Bills
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts on this collection of five bills 
related to education funding.
I am opposed to state funding of education in general, instead viewing education of 
children as both the privilege and the responsibility of parents.  While I understand that 
Article VIII of the Maine Constitution requires municipal funding of public schools, it 
does not require any funding for them from the state level or any funding for non-public 
education.
Introducing public funding of private schools and homeschools is especially insidious, 
as wherever government money flows, government control follows and overall costs 
increase.
While these bills may seem like a boon to Maine families, they will—if passed—end up 
being a benefit to the big-government forces of the state, for the stick always follows the
carrot.
I urge you to reject all five bills and to work to preserve freedom in these areas.
