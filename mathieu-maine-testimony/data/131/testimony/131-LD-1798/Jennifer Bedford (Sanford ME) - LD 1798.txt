LD 1798
Mr Rafferty, Mr Brennan and esteemed colleagues of the education and cultural 
affairs committee, 
I write today and ask that you Please oppose LD 1798 and 1860. Homeschooling has 
always flourished without government funding, and it will continue to do so. We do 
not want government funding, we want to be excluded from this and any and all 
funding in the future so that we can preserve our homeschool freedom. This bill may 
have been put forth with good intentions but what happens when you are no longer 
here to stand with us? I'll tell you, others who want control will impose rules on 
homeschoolers because of the funding. This is why I ask that you please oppose LD 
1798 and LD 1860.
