LD 1771 - An Act Regarding Speedy Trials 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representauve Moonen and members of the Jomt Standmg Comm1ttee on 
Jud1c1ary, greetmgs My name 1s Carol Garvan, and I am Legal D1rector for the Amencan C1v1l 
L1be1t1es Umon of Mame, a statewlde orga;n1zat1on commltted to advancmg and preservmg c1v1l 
hbert1es guaranteed by the Mame and U S Const1tut1ons through advocacy, educatlon, and 
ht1gat1on On behalf of our members, we urge you to support LD 1771 
If passed, th1s 1eg1s1at1on would do the followmg (1) estabhsh a clear basehne for the tnnmg of 
cnmmal tnals, (2) recogmze that, m some cases, there are reasonable excuses for delay m the 
commencement of cnmmal tnals beyond the baselme, and (3) provlde clear 1'6I1‘1Cd16S for 
addressmg delays caused by unreasonable excuses l 
In our legal system, people are presumed lnnocent, and the burden 1s on the government to prove 
gwlt beyond a reasonable doubt The government 1s not supposed to be allowed to coerce people 
1nto confessmg or pleadmg gullty The Mame and U S Const1tut1ons guarantee a falr process to 
every person accused of CI'lII16S 
A fa1r process mcludes a “speedy and publ1c tr1al” —that’s the phrase 1n the S1xth Amendment to 
the U S Constltutlon Artlcle One, sectlon 6 of the Mame Const1tut1on smnlarly guarantees the
nght “to have a speedy, pubhc and 1mpart1altr1al ” But today, 1n Mame, people are m some cases 
wa1t1ng years for then day 1n court that’s years before people have a chance to defend the1r 
1nnocence, and years before v1ct1ms of cnmes can see that _|ust1ce 1s bemg done When crnmnal 
tr1als are unreasonably delayed, everyone loses 
R1ght now, Mame courts are bogged down W1th hrstonc backlogs, and people who have been 
accused of cnmes but who are st11l entrtled to the presumpt1on of mnocence are paymg the pnce 
It 1s 1n everyo11e ’s 1nterest —the defendants, the prosecutors, vlctnns, and _]udges—to have clear 
t1melmes for when defendants must be brought to tnal 
When the government makes the dec1s1on to charge a person W1th a cnme, 1t sets the crnnmal 
process 1n motlon, and we all have a respons1b1l1ty to make sure that th1s process 1s fa1r Mame 1s 
one of only nme states that does not have any clear enforceable tnnelme for brn1g1ng a person to 
tnal And, no-t comc1dentally, Mame has a backlog of well over 20,000 cr1m1nal cases Mame 
should _]O1I1 the 41 other states, 1n adoptmg a speedy tnal law w1th spec1f1c trmelmes to ensure 
that the cr1m1nal process 1s fa1r and eff1c1ent 
F orcmg people to wart years for then‘ day 1n court upends the1rl1ves People 1n Ja1l awartmg tnal 
are separated from thelr farmhes, they are unable to earn a hv1ng, and they are 
often cut off from necessary medlcal and mental health care No person should be separated from 
the1r famrly and commun1ty srmply because the state cannot carry out 1ts bas1c respons1b1ht1es 1n 
a t1mely manner 
In a recent dec1s1on, I/Iﬁnchester v State of Mame} the Law Court recogmzed that establlshmg 
“bnght hne” speedy tnal rules was somethmg the Legrslature could and should do The Court 
f1rst observed that the rrght to a speedy tnal anns to prevent three d1st1nct forms of harm “(l) 
undue and oppress1ve 1ncarcerat1on pnor to tnal, (2) anxlety and concern accompanymg pubhc 
1 2023 ME 23

;>I- 
accusatlon, and (3) 1mpa1rment of the accused’s ab1l1ty to mount a defense ”2 To prevent these 
harms, the Law Court looked to four factors related to the delay of a crnmnal tnal the length of 
the delay, the reasons for the delay, the assertron of the nght by the accused, and the pre_]ud1c1al 
effect of the delay 3 But, the Law Court was l1m1ted 1n Wmchester by 1ts role as the mterpreter of 
the const1tut1on, wh1ch rarely contams “bnght lme rules ” In contrast, the Leg1s1ature can and 
should enact spec1f1c enforceable standards on speedy tnal, _]1lSt as 41 other state leglslatures 
have done As the Law Court noted 1n Wmchester, “Wh1le bnght lmes can be helpful, they are 
more appropnately set by leglslatures, not courts [W]e agree that spec1f1c1ty can be 
benef1c1a1 when set by the leg1slature ”4 
LD 1771 auns to prevent the ham1s 1dent1f1ed by the Law Court by mcorporatmg the same set of 
concerns that ammate the constltutlonal analysls, wh1le also prov1dmg the “brlght l1ne” 
protectlon that 1s both appropnate and necessary 
Part one of th1s b1ll estabhshes a clear default rule when an 1nd1v1dual1s locked up awa1tmgtr1al 
for at least 30 days, they must be brought to tnal w1th1n 180 days 1f they are charged w1th murder 
or a Class A, B, or C offense, or w1thm 45 days 1f they are charged w1th a Class D or E offense 
Estabhshmg these rules ahead of UII16 ensures that prosecutors, and the courts, are aware of the 
t1m1ng for each defendant 
Part two of the b1ll estabhshes the tlmehne for md1v1duals who have not been locked up awa1t1ng 
tnal For people 1n th1s s1tuat1on (who have an lmportant, though d1m1n1shed, need for speed), a 
tnal must commence W1thm 270 days for people charged w1th murder or a Class A, B, orC 
offense, or w1th1n 60 days for a Class D or E offense 
These tlmelmes are well W1th1n the range set by other state speedy tnal acts Th1s b1ll requlres 
tnal w1thm s1x to nme months for felon1es SIX months 1s the smgle most common deadlme set 
2 Wmchester, paragraph 30 
3 Wmchester, paragraphs 26, 31 
4 Winchester, paragraph 35, 39
3
by other states,5 and v1rtually all states’ deadlmes fall w1th1n 2-12 months And th1s b1ll’s 
tnnehnes are al1gned w1th those set by other states comparable 1n populatlon to Mame for 
example, sew Hampsh1re requrres tnal w1th1n four months for defendants 1n custody and s1x to 
nme months for defendants not 1n custody, and Hawan requ1res tnal w1th1n s1x months for all 
offenses 
Part three of the b1l1 recogn1zes that no two cnnnnal cases are exactly ahke, and 3.d]11S'ES these 
t1mel1nes to take account of these drfferences It excludes from the “speedy tnal” clock any delay 
that 1s attnbutable to the defendant ’s actlons, such as askmg for a contmuance or takmg an 
mterlocutory appeal In add1t1on, 1t excludes t1me spent on transfer process1ng,transpo1tat1on, 
and med1cal exam1nat1ons, as well as t1me that the court spends (up to 30 days) tak1ng matters 
under advlsement Fmally, the b1ll excludes t1me that elapses when the state defers prosecutlon, 
delays resultmg from a defendant ’s mcompetence to stand tnal, and reasonable delays rnvolvmg 
co-defendants 
Part four ensures that a m1stnal does not result 1n un]ust1f1ed delay 1n re-tnal, and part f1ve 
ensures that prosecutors are not able to d1sm1ss and then I‘6fLl€ 1dent1cal charges 1n order to re- 
start the clock Part s1x recogn1zes that the nght to a speedy tnal belongs to the person accused, 
and (l1ke other const1tut1ona1nghts) 1t may be vahdly walved 1f the md1v1dual1s aware of the 
effect of Wa1ver 
As the Supreme Court recognlzed more than 200 years ago, every nght must have a remedy,“ 
and part seven prov1des that remedy here 1f a tnal does not commence w1thm the t1me 
5 Based on our rev1ew, the followmg 13 states requ1retr1aloffelon1es w1th1n 6 months (180 days) Colorado, 
Hawan, Idaho, Ind1ana, Maryland, M1ch1gan, M1ssoun, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexlco, New York, South 
Dakota, and Wyommg Another 15 states requ1re tnalw1th1n even shorter tlmeframes Alaska (120 days), Anzona 
(150-180 days), Cahfomla (60 days), Flonda (175 days), lll1no1s (120-160 days), Kansas (150-180 days),

and W1sconsm (90 days post-demand)

proper redress ” Marbury v Madzson, 5 U S 137, 147 (1803)

estabhshed by statute, the case shall be d1sm1ssed w1th pre]ud1ce 7 Th1s 1s the remedy already 
requrred for a v1o1at1on of the constltutronal rlght to speedy tnal Farlure to follow the rules must 
result 1n consequences 8W1thout an effectrve enforcement mechamsm, 1t 1s unhkely that the state 
w1ll fmd the motlvatron to ensure that crrmmal matters are resolved m a tlmely manner, 1f 1t 
could, 1t would have already 
For these reasons, we urge you to vote ought to pass LD 1771
