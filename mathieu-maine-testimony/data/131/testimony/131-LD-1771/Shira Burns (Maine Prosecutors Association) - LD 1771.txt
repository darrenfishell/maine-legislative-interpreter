MAINE PROSECUTORS ASSOCIATION 
SHIRA BURNS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
“An Act Regardmg Speedy Tnals” 
Before the J oInt Standmg Comrmttee on Jud1cIary 
PublIc Hearmg Date May 10, 2023 
Testrmony In Oppos1tIon of LD 1771 
Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen and members of the JOInt StandIng CommIttee on 
Jud1cIary My name 1S Sh1ra Burns and I represent the Mame Prosecutors Assoc1at1on and am 
test1fyIng In oppos1t1on of LD 1771 
The propos1tIon of resolvrng cases In our cr1m1nal _]l1S'£1CC system faster 1S supported by all It 1S 
better for cnme v1ct1ms to have resolutron faster and It 1s better for prosecutron to have cases 
resolved faster Usually, the more trme that exrsts between the crIme occurrlng and the t1me of the 
tnal works agarnst the successful prosecutron of a defendant That beIng sa1d, the MaIne 
Prosecutors Assoc1atIon cannot support LD 1771 as It does not take Into cons1deratIon the lack of 
resources avarlable In the cr1mInal _]1lSll1CC system to conform to the speerﬁed t1mel1nes In the b1ll 
Any entrty that plays a part In the crIm1nal _]LlS'£1C6 system would have to be greatly expanded to 
meet any of these trme reqturements That would Include law enforcement, prosecutron, vIct1m 
w1tness advocates, cr1me lab, Jud1c1al branch, avarlable expert wltnesses, Indrgent legal servrces, 
etc Slmply put, the t1mel1nes proposed are not realIst1c and wIll lead to mass dIsmIssal of cases, 
many that drrectly Impact publrc safety 
The proposed legIslatIon has many procedural collateral consequences F Irst, mrsdemeanor-level 
cases W111 start to be prIorIt1zed over felony-level cases wh1ch 1S In complete oppos1t1on of current 
practlce Currently, the practrce 1S to go to trIal ﬁrst on cases In wh1ch a person 1S In custody, 
startlng wrth the felony-level cases However, sInce there are shorter t1mel1nes for mIsdemeanor- 
level cases, those would have to be prIorIt1zed over any felony-level cases Th1s bIll even pr1or1t1zes 
tr1als for mrsdemeanor-level cases for defendants NOT In custody over defendants Incarcerated that 
have felony-level cases pendmg 
Second, the proposed leg1slat1on Ineentrvrzes more motron practrce by defendants solely for the 
purpose of extendmg the t1mel1ne of prosecutron to come up agalnst these speedy trral deadhnes 
Currently, the process after arra1gmnent 1S to attend a d1sposIt1onal conference and schedule a tr1al 
date If the case 1S not resolved However, If the defendant ﬁles a motron to suppress, that needs to 
get scheduled and heard before the tr1al happens To be heard on any motron of that sort delays the 
tlme to tr1a1
Th1rd, there 1s no toll1ng except10n for when a Jury can’t be sat Th1s happens for many reasons, but 
1t 1s most common 1n sexual assault cases or when the v1ct1m 1s a ch11d 
Fourth, there would be mass d1sm1ssals come January 1, 2024, the effectrve date of th1s b1ll based 
on the 27,000 actlve cases 1n Ma1ne’s cr1m1nal Just1ce system Th1s would mclude murder, 
manslaughter, domest1c v1olence, sexual assault and OUI cnmes If 1t 1s not lntended for th1s b11l to 
apply to cases that were 1n1t1ated before January 1, 2024, the current 27,000 cases pend1ng would 
1ndeﬁn1tely be delayed as the pr1or1ty would go to the cases that need to meet the stnct statutory 
t1mel1nes outlmed 1n th1s b1ll' 
F1fth, the remedy for noncompllance 1s d1sm1ssa1 w1th preJud1ce, mean1ng the case cannot be 
brought back Many of these cases have v1ct1ms to the cr1me and are offered protect1ons through the 
cr1m1nal Justrce process 1nclud1ng no contact orders and weapon restr1ct1ons Those protect1ons 
would be gone w1th th1s remedy If the language 1s changed to d1sm1ssa1 w1thout preJud1ce, there 
w1ll be an unattended consequence of procedurally clogg1ng our cr1m1nal Justlce system w1th the 
reﬁl1ng of cases If a case 1s d1sm1ssed w1thout preJud1ce and 1s worthy of further prosecutlon, all 
three parts of the cr1m1nal Justlce system (prosecutlon, defense, and the court) w1ll be more 
burdened w1th the reﬁlmg of a case 1nstead of lettmg the pendrng case cont1nue through the process 
These are Just the collateral consequences that prosecutors can pred1ct at th1s t1me We have leamed 
there 1s always a chance, espec1ally a change of th1s nature, for unattended collateral consequences 
For example, durlng COVID all parts of the cr1m1na1 Just1ce system used thelr own 1nher1t power to 
keep the system aﬂoat dur1ng these try1ng t1mes Prosecutors d1sm1ssed cases that d1dn’t have an 
obvrous pub11c safety nexus, defense ﬁled mot1ons to amend ba1l on all the1r mcarcerated chents, 
and Judges granted many of these motlons to release prlsoners All partles 1n the cr1m1nal Just1ce 
system came together to work out solutlons w1thout the need for leg1slat1on, balancmg a 
defendant ’s const1tut1onal r1ghts, publ1c safety, and the procedural problems the ensued because of 
COVID If th1s b1ll was 1n place before COVID, there would have been mass d1sm1ssals when the 
court could not conduct Jury tnals Th1s b1l1 has no lenlency for the unpredlcted 
A defendants ’ rlght to a speedy trlal 1s currently governed by our Const1tut1on, case law and Marne 
Rules of Umﬁed Cr1m1nal Procedure Our Ma1ne Supreme Jud1c1al Court recently analyzed a 
defendant ’s r1ght to a speedy tnal 1n a dec1s1on dated March 30, 2023 1 
In that case, the Court went 
through the hrstory of the const1tut1onal amendment, prev1ous statutory obl1gat1ons, and the current 
practrce of hav1ng a ﬂex1ble standard of unnecessary delay Specrﬁcally, our Ma1ne Supreme 
J ud1c1al Court sa1d “precedent supports the use of a ﬂex1ble, mult1-factor test As an overarchmg 
pr1nc1ple, we have repeated many t1mes that the const1tut1onal standard for a speedy tr1al 1s ﬂex1ble, 
and the appl1cat1on of the standard 1s dependent on the umque crrcumstances of each case There are 
several factors that we have concluded are relevant to th1s ﬂex1ble analysrs ” Id at 25 The Court 
went on to name the factors as (1) length of delay, (2) reasons for the delay, (3) assert1on of the 
nght, and (4) preJud1ce

Wlnchester v State, 2023 ME23
If the po1nt of th1s leg1slat1on1s to move cases faster through the cr1m1nal _]L1St1C6 process, there are 
many b1lls 1n th1s sesslon that W111 help All three parts of the cr1m1nal _|ust1ce system are askmg for 
more fundmg, support those b11ls There 1s leg1slat1on to reclasslfy some cr1m1na1 offenses to c1v1l 
v1olat1ons supported by law enforcement and prosecutors, support those b1lls In Cr1m1nal Law 
Advrsory Comm1ttee ’s (CLAC) memorandum to th1s commlttee regardlng LD 576, An Act to 
Fac1l1tate Commumcatlon Between Pro Se Defendants and Prosecutors, CLAC noted that the 
current law preventlng defendants and prosecutors speakmg has “contrlbuted to slowmg the 
resolutlon of lower-level cases,” repeal that law The best leg1s1at1on to get speedler trlals 1s to 
address why the case 1sn’t belng resolved sooner rather than _]llS'£ saylng the case has to resolve 
sooner x 
For these reasons, the Ma1ne Prosecutors Assoc1at1on 1s 1n opp0s1t1on of LD 1771
