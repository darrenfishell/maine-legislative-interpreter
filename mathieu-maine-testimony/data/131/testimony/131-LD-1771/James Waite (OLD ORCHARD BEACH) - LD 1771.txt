LD 1771
I'm writing in support of LD 1771, "An Act Regarding Speedy Trials."
Article I, Section 6 of the Maine Constitution states that the accused shall have a right
to a speedy trial, yet Maine law doesn't define what constitutes a speedy trial. This bill
rectifies that by establishing time limits for the commencement of a defendant's 
criminal trial and provides remedies for when the time limits have been violated.
I have a friend who was arrested and charged with a Class D crime in August of 2021 
and his trial won't happen until August of 2023 at the earliest. I find this totally 
unacceptable and this bill would remedy this going forward. My friend has been 
living his life in a state of limbo for 21 months, he turned down an excellent job offer 
just because he has this trial hanging over his head, and in my opinion his conditions 
of release violate his civil liberties. By making a person wait for trial like this, the 
process becomes part of the punishment, a punishment that is unwarranted, especially 
if the accused is found not guilty at trial. 
I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 1771.
Sincerely, James M Waite
