In Support of 
LD 1884 An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy Development 
May 18, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Committee on Energy, Utilities, 
and Technology, my name is Dustin Delano and l am the Chief Operating Officer for the New 
England Fishermen Stewardship Association (NEFSA) and also a commercial lobster ﬁshermen 
of over 20 years NEFSA supports LD 1884, An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy 
Development 
NEFSA is an alliance of the wild harvesters of the waters off of New England, dedicated to 
educating the public about how best to manage our seafood resources through sound science 
and best practices at conservation used by fishermen, With a view toward economic well- 
being, ecosystem sustainability and US food security 
The Gulf of Maine is home to thousands of coexisting marine species, including endangered 
species, who depend on it’s healthy ecosystem and unwavering environment for their veiy 
existence Beyond the effected marine species are many types of birds and bats, some of 
whom are also endangered species A recent quote from Dr Robert Barclay, a professor of 
biological sciences at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada said, 
“Wind energy /S booming in Alberta as else Wear and bats and wind turbines 
don’t get along very well The wind turbines kill a lot of bats ln fact in Alberta it kills 
more bats than it does birds” 
Dr Cori Lausen, director of bat conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society Canada said 
“ all they have to do IS get close to these blades and that’s a low pressure zone and 
that literally causes the blood vessels in their lungs to explode Sort of like a scuba 
diver coming up too quickly”
A specles ln slmllar slze to a bat lS the Atlantlc Puffln who have offshore nestlng areas and are 
llsted as havlng a vulnerable conservatlon status due to thelr decreaslng populatlon Much 
work, such as Pro/ect Puffln, has taken place over the last few decades to help restore thls 
threatened specles ln Malne 
A healthy Gulf of Malne ls also cruclal to Malne’s economy Malne’s flshlng lndustry ranks hlgh 
among the state and lts lobster catch IS the blggest ln the country Commerclal flshlng ls the 
malnstay of coastal areas, mostly domlnated by lobster flshlng, though many ground flshermen 
stlll work the waters of the Gulf of Malne Offshore wlnd development has the VERY real 
potentlal for the commerclal and recreatlonal flshlng lndustry to be lrrevocably harmed 
Floatlng offshore wlnd turblnes wlll stand almost 900’ tall, nearly three tlmes the helght of the 
Statue of Llberty Each structure wlll encompass nearly one square mlle of area when 
anchorlng systems are factored ln Three sets of chalns, wlth lndlvldual llnks the slze of plck 
up truck beds, wlll be anchored to moorlngs at a dlagonal angle from the base In 
presentatlons from developers, a 7 1 or as much as 9 1 scope wlll be necessary, causlng the 
chalns to sweep across the ocean floor, destroylng all habltat wlthln lts path on every wlnd or 
tlde change 
Because of the spaclal lmpact, flshlng wlll be lmposslble wlthln wlnd farms Developers llke to 
say flshlng wlll remaln open wlthln the arrays, but the truth ls, flshlng wlthln them wlll be 
extremely dangerous as hangups wlll be unavoldable Flsh draggers wlll be unable to tow nets 
between turblnes as they'll rlsk catastrophlc losses from hangups Lobstermen are requlred by 
federal law to flsh a mlnlmum of 25 traps on a trawl outslde the twelve mlle llne ln lobster 
management area 1 and a mlnlmum of 45 traps on a trawl ln lobster management area 3, 
maklng lt lmposslble to lay a trawl amongst the arrays 
Another major lssue lles wlth cable deployment When developers lay new cables, they use let 
ploughs to blow masslve swaths of bottom out of the way to bury the cables Anythlng ln the 
path of the let ploughs on the softer bottom wlll be completely destroyed Of course the cable 
can not be burled on hard bottom so that cable wlll lay across the ocean floor, leavlng ocean 
llfe much more exposed to the electro-magnetlc flelds 
For generatlons, flshermen have been true stewards to the ocean envlronment and are dlrectly 
responslble for the current presen/atlon of the Gulf of Malne as a result of thelr sustalnablllty 
efforts Every flsherman l know has a lTl9.]0l ’ goal of preservlng the flsherles and herltage for
future generations, just like they were fortunate enough to inherit lndustrializing our oceans 
does not provide a future for the youth in Maine to have access Turning the Gulf of Maine into 
a “New York City,” does not allow for wild caught seafood to continue being provided to 
Americans amongst times of food insecurities 
As Mainers, you’ve likely travelled through towns in the northern part of the state where the 
logging industry and paper mills once supported entire communities Areas once filled with 
growing families and hopeful and prosperous dreams, were slowly ripped away Now when 
you travel through, you see abandoned homes, decrepit buildings, and a real sense of struggle 
—forcing the youth to move away from areas where their families lived for generations Please, 
make decisions that keep our communities from ending up in the same predicament The New 
England Fishermen Stewardship Association urges you to think responsibly of the future of the 
Gulf of Maine Help protect the vast marine species and ocean eco-system Help protect our 
coastal communities, our economy, and our fishermen NEFSA strongly encourages you to 
support LD 1884
