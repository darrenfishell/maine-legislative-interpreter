LD 1884
Dear Honorable Members of the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee,
I am Cynthia Beauvais. I reside in Jonesport where lobstering represents at least forty 
(40) percent of our local economy. I rent fourteen (14) homes to local families. Ten, 
or over seventy (70) percent, of these families participate in heritage marine 
harvesting. They work the shores and waters to earn their living. 
The development and installation of offshore wind turbines would pose a severe 
threat to our livelihood, our economy, our environment.  Iâ€™m concerned about what 
industrializing our waters will produce: a deleterious effect on our ocean bottom and 
the bounty it provides. Research reports are already showing deformed lobsters in 
what would be areas surrounding offshore wind turbines due to electromagnetic 
fields. (enerycentral.com   May 2, 2022). Another report indicates the offshore wind 
industry is concerned enough about potential ramifications that a bunch of offshore 
power companies have applied for incidental take permits, which are basically a free 
pass on accidentally killing whales (wattsupwiththat.com   May 14, 2023).
I am in favor of LD 1884.
I humbly ask this committee to support this bill and move LD 1884 forward. 
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration. 
Cynthia Beauvais
Jonesport, America
