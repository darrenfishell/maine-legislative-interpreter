LD 18 84 An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy Development 
 
May 18, 2 023 
 Senator Lawrence , Representa�ve Zeigler , and members of the Energy, U�li�es and Technology 
Commitee. My name is Kristan Porter and I am  a commercial lobsterman from Cutler and  
President of the Maine Lobstermen’s Associa�on  (MLA) . The MLA supports  LD 1884 to prohibit 
oﬀshore wind development.  
 The MLA thanks Representa�ve Strout and the bill cosponsors for bringing this bill forward  to 
expand Maine’s ban of oﬀshore wind to include  federal waters .  
 The MLA strongly oppose s oﬀshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine. MLA’s opposi�on is 
deeply rooted in concern over industrializing a fragile and produc�ve Gulf of Maine ecosystem . 
Erec�ng hundreds of oﬀshore wind turbines taller than Boston’s Pruden�al tower that sit on 
ﬂoa�ng pla�orms the length of a football ﬁeld is an  industrializ a�on of  the Gulf of Maine , 
pu� ng at risk its wildlife, habitat, commercial and recrea�onal ﬁsheries, and a way of life that 
has sustained thousands of Maine families for more than a century.  
 Despite our opposi�on, the MLA has been highly engaged in Maine’s oﬀshore  wind planning 
process to learn as much as possible about oﬀshore wind, par�cularly ﬂoa�ng technology, while educa�ng other stakeholders about the importance of the Gulf of Maine to the ﬁshing industry and its concerns with this renewable energy sour ce.  
 
Both the state and federal governments readily acknowledge that the impacts of large scale ﬂoa�ng oﬀshore wind development are largely unknown, yet they want to ﬁgure it out as they 
go, and con�nue to charge forward. This is  not a risk the ﬁshing indus try is willing to take.  
 If this Commitee determines that it does not have the authority to  ban oﬀshore wind in federal 
waters , the MLA strong ly recommends that you review the federal consistency provision under 
the Coastal Zone Management Act that allows the state to review federal ac�ons . The 
Legislature should make sure  that it has proper statutes, regula�ons and permi�ng 

requirements in place to ensure that f ederal oﬀshore wind projects do not adversely aﬀect the 
state of Maine .  
 
With more than 20,000 individuals employed aboard Maine’s ﬁshing vessels and the seafood 
supply c hain , oﬀshore wind threatens a way of life that has sustained thousands of Maine 
families for more than a century .  
 The MLA urges you to vote ought to pass on LD 18 84 to prevent oﬀshore wind development in 
the Gulf of Maine . Thank you for your considera �on.
