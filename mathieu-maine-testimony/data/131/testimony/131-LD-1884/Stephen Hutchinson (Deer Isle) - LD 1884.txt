I'm a 5th generation lobster man I'm 100% behind 1884 I do not want wind energy or 
seismic testing I'm not a scientist but I'm not a dummy either nothing good will 
become of wind energy on the ocean it endangers all marine life in the ocean and out 
such as seabirds , migrating birds, whales, dolphins, basically every thing in the 
ocean. The cables transmit heat the wind turbines possibly change weather conditions,
they are a navigation hazzard to all boaters commercial and pleasure. Maine waters 
are not for sale to foreign countries/investors you are messing with  gods fishermen  
and all their families you are endangering whole communities of financial collapse. 
This wind is no good for Mainers, No fishermen want the pollution in the water 
period.
