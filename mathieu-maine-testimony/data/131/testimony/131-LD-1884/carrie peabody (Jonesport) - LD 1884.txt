Subject: LD 1884: An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy Development  
 
My name is Carrie Peabody and I live in Jonesport Maine.   
My husband fishes offshore for lobster and has been in the fishing trade all his life.   
We are in support of the LD 1884, An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy 
Development.   
Offshore wind poses a threat to the lobster fishing industry and to my husband ’s 
livelihood.  
Maine cannot take a chance with offshore wind development in the Gulf of Maine.   
This industry threatens fertile fishing grounds and will blemish our pristine and scenic 
coastline.  
 
Federal Whale regulations are in place to protect the end angered Right Whale as it is 
‘believed’ that lobster gear harms whales.  
What federal regulations are in place to protect Right Whales from Offshore Wind Farm 
operations?   
 
Its time to respect our waters and our environment and to stop disrespecting our f ishing 
communities up/down the coast for the good of green energy.   
If we persist, we will have nothing but an industrialized coastline that benefits no one 
but wealthy foreign corporations only interested in our resources.  
 
Please support the lobstermen and our marine heritage.  Support LD 1884.
