LD 1884
Dear Commitee Chair(s) and members,
I am writing to urge you to oppose the LD1884 - An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind 
Energy Development.
This bill, I believe, intends to limit the options we have:
1. to create renewable energy
2. to provide new, skilled jobs
3. to continue advancing the technology investments already in progress (VolturnUS, 
etc.)
4. to reduce dependence on fossil fuels
5. to help stabilize the atmosphere on our planet Earth
6. to help the fishing industry by lowering the ocean water temperatures (as the 
increasing temperature is causing fish/crustacian/mammal species to move/die)
7. to lower the vector of damaging flooding events and coastal storm damage because 
of the climate crisis we are now experiencing.
There is no reasonable need to limit our renewable energy possibilities considering 
we are headed in the direction of making our planet inhospitable to many species 
including and especially humans, due to fossil fuel use-related activity over the past 
century, per the consensus of all scientists.
I urge you to oppose LD 1884 - An Act to Prohibit Offshore Wind Energy 
Development.  It will decrease our freedom to diversify on much needed renewable 
(and less expensive) energy sources; cause more harm to all citizens of Maine by not 
choosing a more sustainable alternative than fossil fuels which are polluting our air, 
land and water;  lower our quality of life by continuing to be dependent on, and 
continued use of damaging fossil fuels to the only planet that can sustain life, Earth.  
Thank you,
Jonathan Wilcox
