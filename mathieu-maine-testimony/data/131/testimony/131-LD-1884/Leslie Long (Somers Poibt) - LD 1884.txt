I am against offshore wind turbines as they will continue to destroy habitat, breeding, 
migration and cause death for miles.  The information on the damage to the ecosystem
and the unique coastal Eastern United States is included in the permits although there 
is no actual data on how bad this will be considering these turbines are larger and 
closer than any in the world. The list of authorized ‘takes’ requested and permitted 
continually is criminal considering the Endangered Species Act and many protections 
put in place for our oceans. We are already seeing the collateral damage and this has 
only begun. Do the right thing and stop offshore wind before the coast is damaged 
beyond repair.
