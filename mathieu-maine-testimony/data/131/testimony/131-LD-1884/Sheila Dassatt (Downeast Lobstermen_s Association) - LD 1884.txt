Sheila Dassatt
Downeast Lobstermen's Association
LD 1884
My name is Sheila H. Dassatt and I represent the Downeast Lobstermen's 
Association. 
We represent the fishermen and are primarily fishermen ourselves. Most of us are 
generational fishermen and have traditionally fished or been associated with the 
fishery for most of our lives.
We are in favor of LD 1884. We are definitely opposed to offshore wind and feel that 
it is not the place to be experimenting with our marine wildlife and the birds that are 
also threatened by the turbine blades.
I have been involved with the Fishermen's Working Group, associated with Governor 
Mills since the beginning. It seems that there's a lot of double standards with the 
proposal of offshore wind. The same people that want to protect the whales are the 
same ones that are in favor of Green energy, which includes the approval of offshore 
wind.
There are way too many variables to consider....too much too soon. We also 
understand that more research needs to be accomplished before a plan like this can 
stand the test of time.
We know that you have been given a lot of facts and simply want you to know where 
we stand. Thank you for opposing such an risky venture.
Respectfully,
Sheila H. Dassatt
