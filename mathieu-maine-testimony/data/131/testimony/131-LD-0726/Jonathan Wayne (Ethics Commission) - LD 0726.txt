To: Rachel Olson, Office of Policy and Legal Analysis From: Jonathan Wayne, Executive Director Date: March 13, 2023 Re: Comments on Language of LD 726  
 
Since December 2022, the Ethics Commissi on staff has been pr oviding advice to our 
regulated constituencies concerning two laws from 2021 and 2022 ( P.L. 2021, Chapters 274  and 
607) that took effect January 1, 2023.  These la ws added some signifi cant restrictions and 
prohibitions to Maine campaign finance law, including imposing varying limits/prohibitions on 
contributions to PACs, restricting the funds that  PACs may use to contribute to candidates and 
leadership PACs, and prohibiting business entities from contributing to candidates and leadership 
PACs. 
I watched the March 8, 2023 public hearing for LD 726, sponsored by Sen. Jeffrey 
Timberlake.  He said the intent of the bill was to undo the restrictions and prohibitions that took 
effect January 1, 2023. 
As Maine’s campaign finance agency, the Co mmission is neutral on LD 726 and whether 
any of the January 1st changes should rolled back.  We unde rstand the reform objectives of the 
new law, and we understand the concerns it ha s raised for candidate s and committees.  Our 
primary interest is that the law is clear and we do a good job administering it. 
Toward that end, I wanted to share with you that LD 726, as wr itten, does not achieve 
Sen. Timberlake’s objectives.  To undo the restri ctions and prohibitions th at went into effect 
January 1st, LD 726 would need to be amended to reverse all of the insertions and deletions  in 
P.L. 2021, Chapters 274  and 607. 
Please let our office know if we can provide  information about any other potential 
changes to these new laws.
