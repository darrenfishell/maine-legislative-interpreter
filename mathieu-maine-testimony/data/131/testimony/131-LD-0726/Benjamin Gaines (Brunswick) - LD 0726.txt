RE:  LD 726: An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Political Action   
  Committees Relating to Union, Business and Nonprofit Organizations  
 
 
Good morning , Senator Hickman and Representative Supica . 
 My name is Benjamin Gaines, I am a resident  of Bruns wick, and I am he re today as 
a volunteer with Maine Citizens for Clean Elections. I am also an attorney, and in a 
former life was a professional campaign fundraiser. I am  testifying in opposition to 
LD 7 26. 
 After years of effort, in 2021 the legislature passed a ban on candidate contributions 
from corporations and other business entities. This ban serves to promote 
transparen cy, reduce  corruption and the appearance of corruption , and to 
discourage circumvention  of contribution limits. LD 726 removes  the new 
requirement that PAC cont ributions to candidates and leadership PAC s not be 
derived from business entity funds . 
 Simply put,  this introduces a massive loophole to the new  ban. 
 I know from my experience as a fundraiser that money will flow  readily  through 
whatever streams we permit it. If the legislat ure were to open up this new loophole, 
we should expect that  corporate contributions will  once again  begin to pour through 
it to candidates and elected off icials .  
 Maine voters have repeatedly told the legislature that they value a robust  and 
transparen t scheme of campaign  finance regulation.  The business entity 
contribution  ban was an important addition to that scheme , and I would urge you 
today not to so seriously  undermine it  just as it now takes effect .
