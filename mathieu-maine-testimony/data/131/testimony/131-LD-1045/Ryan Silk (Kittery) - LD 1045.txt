Good Afternoon,
 My name is Ryan Silk, currently residing in Kittery, Maine attached to Hanscom Air 
Force Base.  I am presently in the United States Air Force for the past 18 years having
joined the military in 2005 when I was a resident of Kennebunk.  I am a current 
holder of an Enhanced Drivers License with the state of Vermont, with my legal 
address being Woodbury, VT (where I grew up and have paternal patronage). As I am
in the military, and only have about two years until I retire,  I am wanting to express 
my interest and desire for the State of Maine to offer the Enhance License for it 
citizens.  
 Currently, there are five states that offer the EL.  Two of the five states offer this due 
to them being split with Canada; Minnesota and Washington State.  The other three 
states that offer the EL are Michigan, New York and Vermont.  From my research, all
of these states started to offer the EL almost 12 years ago as the Real ID Act made it 
mandatory.  Maine, took almost 15 years to become compliant.  
 If the state legislator was to pass this bill,  I would recommend that the state phases 
out the REAL ID cards as the Enhanced License offers more benefits.  This was the 
approach that the State of Washington took.  As a result, they have over a million 
users.
