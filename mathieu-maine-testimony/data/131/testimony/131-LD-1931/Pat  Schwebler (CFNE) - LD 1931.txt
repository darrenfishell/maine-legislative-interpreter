 Dear Committee Members,  
 This letter supports  LD# 1931, “An Act to Foster Stable and Affordable Home Ownership in Mobile Home 
Parks by Amending the Laws Relating to the Sale of Mobile Home Parks”.  
 
Maine is facing an unprecedented lack of affordable housing.  
 
Maine has approximately 714 manufactured housing communities (MHCs).  These communities are home to 
approximately 40,000 Maine  residents, where people own their home but not the land their home sits on. 
These  homeowners face unique vulnerabilities  and the risk of displacement when an MHC is closed for  
redevelopment  or sold to an equity -driven investor . The risk of displacement is even more threatening 
when residents learn mobile  homes are not really mobile – studies show 80% of manufactured homes are 
never moved once  sited – and costs for transporting range from $10,000 - $20,000 if a homeowner can 
even find a  site to bring the home to.  
 
Here are a few issues facing MHC residents in Maine:  
·         No effective notice at the time of an MHC sale:  
·         Limited options to match a sale offer from a third party;  
·         No voice in community rules;  
·         No voice in lot rent increases;  
·         It is cost -prohibitive to move a manufactured home; estimates range from $10,000 - $20,000, making 
residents of MHCs “captive” tenants to the landowner. 
·         No security via long -term land leases;  
·         No security against MHC closure for redevelopment.  
 This opportunity to purchase legislation would provide:  
·         A proper, legal notice to ho meowners and the state that the owners intend to sell the community.  
·         A 60 -day period during which the residents can organize, incorporate as a nonprofit with the state, 
and make an informed choice about whether to make their own offer to the sell er. 
·         A reasonable time  after the 60 -day period to obtain financing.  
·         A requirement that the seller negotiates in good faith with the residents.  
·         An effective enforcement mechanism.  
 
Many  of the residents in these communities are low -income, retired, veterans and local workforce 
individuals who contribute dail y to making Maine the great state it is. Please join me in supporting LD# 1931 
and helping to preserve one of the last unsubsidized low -income housing stocks left in the state.
