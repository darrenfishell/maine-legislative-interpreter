  Michael Oneglia Owner & Manager Seacoast Village / Hyland Estates 195 Case Street  West Granby, CT 06090 (207) 413-2100 MOneglia@mac.com  May 22, 2023  Members of the Labor and Housing CommiQee,   I apologize for being unable to appear in person but since this was added to the agenda last minute without a reasonable advanced noVce, I was unable to arrange for childcare in order to tesVfy in person. A brief introducVon of myself: I personally own and manage two manufactured home communiVes in Belfast, ME. I have been in the business for about 8 years and have 90 rental spaces under my management. In the case of both parks, I took over the properVes and inherited signiﬁcant deferred capital expenditures totaling in the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to remedy the roads, water infrastructure, in-ground sewer, sepVc systems, drainage, etc. I took a risk with my life’s savings and borrowed money, bought the two parks, turned them around, and made them into the best places to live in Belfast, all while maintaining fair and reasonable lot rents for the residents.   A consistent theme during my Vme in the business has been a call for us park owners to preserve aﬀordable housing, while at the same Vme being bombarded by hosVle proposed legislaVve documents saddling us with more burden, both administraVvely and ﬁnancially. The biggest enemy of aﬀordable housing has been the government. LD 1931 is one of the most egregious overreaches that I have seen yet. The more of these types of proposed bills that get passed only encourage more owners NOT to get involved with manufactured housing. And they can’t be blamed since there are far easier real estate sectors to parVcipate in such as apartments and single-family housing. These sectors do not see even remotely the same amount of discriminaVon from our representaVves that manufactured housing does.    The issues with LD 1931 are as follows:  
1. It requires the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL informaVon about the sale of a property to a party that is perhaps the most unqualiﬁed of all to purchase the community in terms of property management experience and ﬁnancial acumen.  2. LD 1931 by default gives the tenants a right of ﬁrst refusal for free. I have never heard of a right of ﬁrst refusal being granted without any consideraVon for that right.  3. The 60 days for the tenants to express interest and then the 90 days for them to obtain ﬁnancing would signiﬁcantly devalue the property to any tradiVonal buyer, as no one is going to wait the equivalent of 5 months to conduct due diligence and then sit on the sidelines unVl the tenants either back out or move forward with the purchase.  4. LD 1931 devalues pordolios. Parks sold as part of a pordolio tend to sell for a premium over individual properVes. If each park in a pordolio was separately Ved up by the tenants, who most likely could not obtain ﬁnancing or even the down payment, no professional operator would be interested in wasVng the Vme and paying full price for the parks.   Even more noteworthy, under current law, the tenants are protected from a sale leading to redevelopment within two (2) years of the sale. Also, there is no barrier whatsoever to a tenant or homeowner’s associaVon making an unsolicited oﬀer to buy a manufactured housing community under the exact same process that a tradiVonal buyer would follow. Because of this, LD 1931 serves no purpose to anyone except ROC USA and other advocacy groups that want to circumvent the process that everyone else goes through in order to buy these parks, essenVally cuhng the line of buyers. If passed, LD 1931 will be one of the greatest infringements of landowner’s rights that I have ever seen.   Please do the right thing for aﬀordable housing by NOT passing LD 1931.   Sincerely,      Michael Oneglia
