Dear Maine Legislators,
Grey Stone has been a Resident Owned Community, ROC, since 2010. Every year we make repairs
and improvemeflts to the infrasffucture- \ile have a board and meet monthly to discuss issues,
finances and hear from the membership. It's not easg and we are all volunteers, but we wotk
together and bring our individual strengths and expedence to our comrnunity. Because we work
together and volunteer, we are able to keep our lot rent 1ow at $340 per month which helps us keep
our housing affordable, as we are allon a fixed,low-income budget.
Though it is hard work to keep our community running cooperatively, we are gratefrrl that we could
come together and protect our affotdable homes. As long as'$re pay our loan no one can make us
move and \r;/e can keep our reot reasorrable. We are submitting testimony today to advoeate for
future resident owned communities that may al-so want a chance to secure their affordable housing.
We encourage you to support bill IJ) #1931with a yes vote and help preserve this affotdable
housing for the future residents that might warit the same opportuaity we had.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Melony Stockley, Grey Stone Secretary
