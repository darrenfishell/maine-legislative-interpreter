Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and Honorable Members of the Committee on Housing:    
  
My name is Amy Winston and I live in Edgecomb. I am submi�ng tes�mony  in support of LD 1931 on 
behalf of Coastal Enterprises, Inc. (CEI) , a community development corpora�on (CDC) and community 
deve lopment ﬁnancial ins�tu�on (CDFI) based in Brunswick. F ounded in 1977 , CEI works to build a just, 
vibrant, and climate resilient future for people in communi�es in Maine and other rural regions . We do 
this by integra�ng ﬁnancing,  business and industry exper�se, and policy solu�ons. CEI has had a long 
history of engagement in the aﬀordable housing space. While we no longer manage aﬀordable housing 
proper�es, we con�nue to ﬁnance projects that create new housing units, catalyze economic ac�vity, create jobs, and revitalize downtowns. CEI is a member of the Maine Alliance for Smart Growth and of 
the Maine Aﬀordable Housing Coali�on. Aﬀordable workforce housing is a key economic challenge for 
the businesses we ﬁnance, aﬀec�ng their ability to recruit and retain workers.   
CEI’s Financial Development Services team provides direct counseling services, focusing on foreclosure preven�on counseling for distressed borrowers and consumers throughout the s tate.  Notabl y, they work 
with  Maine ’s ten resident -owned manufactured housing communities  (ROC s), which house some of the 
state’s most vulner able residents , on a 12 -month ﬁnancial wellness program.  Com prised of people with  
low incomes and seniors, t hese residents have chosen this housing o p�on not only based on cost but 
also based upon the idea of ownership and commu nity membership.  
There are roughly 40,000 Mainers living in approximately 714 manufactured housing communi�es 
(MHCs) , or mobile home parks. These individuals do not own the land they live on, only the home that 
they live on , ren�ng the land on which their mobile homes are situated . These homeowners are uniquely 
vulnerable  in that they face rent instability , rely on water, sewer and e lectrical systems  that are 
inadequate , and risk being displaced  when a MHC is closed for redevelopment. When a  MHC is sold , 
mobile home owners  are forced to accept high er lot rates , as the cost of reloca�on of a mobile home - 
$10,000- 20,000 - is o�en beyond the means of its occupant. As s uch, m obile homes are not truly mobile ; 
studies show that 80% of manufactured homes are never moved once sited . Moreover, s hould the buyer 
decide to repurpose MHC  land for an alterna�ve use, residents who are  force d out and  cannot aﬀord to 
transport their home to a new loca�on are o�en forced into homelessness. Currently, when a landowner 
sells MHC property, they do not need to notify those living on the land .  
LD 1931 would ins�tute several key changes th at protect Mainers living in MHCs : 
• The bill would require no�ce be given to mobile homeowners and Maine State Housing Authority in 
the event of the sale of MHC property.  
 
• A�er receiving no�ce, residents have a sixty -day window in which they can decide wh ether to 
organize and purchase the land on which they live from the seller.  
• The seller must nego�ate in good faith and provide reasonable �me for current resident’s  access 
ﬁnancing to secure the purchase. Any oﬀer made by the group of mobile homeowners  must include 
a purchase and sale agreement.  
 
This bill provides necessary protec�ons to mobile homeowners , while providing them with an 
opportunity to secure ownership o f the land on which they live, thereby stabilizing their current 
occupancy and future access to housing.  Aﬀordable housing in Maine is hard to come by . By protec� ng 
those who already live in aﬀordable housing.  CEI s ees LD 1931 as a cri�cal step and straigh�orward 
solu�on for both preven�ng Maine’s housing issues from g e�ng  worse  and for suppor�ng th e ﬁnancial 
wellness of Maine ’s MHC residents . We urge you to vote Ou ght-to-Pass on LD 1931. Thank you for 
considering our tes�mony .
