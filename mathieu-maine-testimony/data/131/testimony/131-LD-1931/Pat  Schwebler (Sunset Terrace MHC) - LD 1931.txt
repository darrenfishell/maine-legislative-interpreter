Statement of support for LD #1931 Legislation 
 
I am the founding and current President of Sunset Terrace Mobile Home 
Cooperative, a Resident Owned Community. 
In September of 2015 the residents were approached by Jessica Pooley of 
Cooperative Development Institute to have us purchase the park. That began five 
months of meetings and training to organize us into the corporation that now owns 
the park. I still cannot believe we completed the process so quickly. We had to get 
the residents informed and then agree to the acquisition, access the park value, and 
make an offer, establish the corporation, set up a board and the committees that run 
the park, establish and approve the organizational documents (Articles of 
Incorporation, Bylaws, Park Rules), and establish and approve our policies for 
operation of the park (too many to list). All of this before we could close on the 
sale and start the real work of managing a business. 
This legislation allows residents the time to consider organizing as their own 
landlords. It is not a matter to be taken lightly, or in haste, but it is a decision the 
residents should be offered and given enough time to organize the residents and 
take a vote. It is not an individual making a purchase, or even an existing company, 
but a group of individuals that need the time for the initial organization to happen. 
In the seven years we have owned the park there has been one lot rent increase, not 
one per year, and the residents overwhelmingly agreed that it was needed for the 
proper operation of the park. 
I believe we made the right decision, and highly recommend that any Mobile 
Home Community consider this solution. 
 
Thank you!
