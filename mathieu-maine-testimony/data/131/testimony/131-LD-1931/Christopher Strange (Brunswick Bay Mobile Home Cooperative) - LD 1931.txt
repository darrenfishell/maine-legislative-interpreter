Brunswick Bay Mobile Home Cooperative was created in 2012 after the 
residents purchased the park.  We are a perfect example why the 
legislation is important.  Our former oener an attorney from the Boston 
area cme to us to give us the opportunity to purchase the park.  We then 
organized and purchased the park.  If the owner had not given that 
opportunity we may not be here today.  I have three other private mobile 
home parks in Brunswick and I would like to have those parks to have the 
same opportunity as we did.
