Testimony in Opposition to LD 1931. 
l have been licensed as a Real Estate Broker in Maine for about 28 years and have been 
a Designated Broker for 23 of those years. ln my professional opinion, the majority of offers we 
receive today have a clause built in that states the offer is confidential and cannot be shared 
with others. lfl do share this offer, it is very likely that a complaint to the Real Estate 
Commission would result in disciplinary action against me including my loss of license. Never 
will an agent show another potential buyer the offer in hand as it is also a violation of our code 
of ethics. Whenever a city or town or even the State sells a parcel they own it is ALWAYS done 
in a sealed bid to get the highest and best price for the property. Why would this be any 
different?
