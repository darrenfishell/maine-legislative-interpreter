Support for LD 1931, Af fordable Hom e O wnership in M obile Hom e Parks
Senator Pierce, Representative G ere, and honorable m em bers of the Housing Com m ittee,
M y nam e is Craig Saddlem ire, and I am the Developm ent O rganizer for the Raise-O p Housing
Cooperative. I strongly urge your support for LD 1931, An Act to F oster Stable and Af fordable
Hom e O wnership in M obile Hom e Parks by Am ending the Laws Relating to the Sale of M obile
Hom e Parks.
M obile hom e parks are a critical form of naturally occurring af fordable housing - especially in
rural M aine com m unities - and that af fordability is best guaranteed when residents have the
opportunity to own the m obile park them selves. T he sale of a m obile hom e park im pacts the
residents in a profound way . Allowing the residents a 60 day notice period gives them tim e to
decide if they want to subm it an of fer to purchase the park. Such conversions of parks from
rental to resident-owned allows residents to benefit m ore fully from the benefits of hom e
ownership, and ensures their fam ilies can have a perm anent place to call hom e.
Please support LD 1931.
Sincerely ,
Craig Saddlem ire
