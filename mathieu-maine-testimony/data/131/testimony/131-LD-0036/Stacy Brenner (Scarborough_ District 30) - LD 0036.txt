Before the Joint Standing Committee on Heath Coverage Insurance and Financial Services
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Committee on Health 
Coverage Insurance and Financial Services, I am Senator Stacy Brenner, and I serve Senate 
District 30, representing the people of Gorham and most of Scarborough. 
I am pleased to introduce LD 36, “An Act to Make Corrections to the Maine Insurance Code” on 
behalf of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance. This 
bill makes several corrections to the Maine Insurance Code. They include modernizing the law 
concerning responses to inquiries of the Superintendent, updating the property and casualty 
insurer investments and diversification laws, updating the producer Education Advisory 
Committee law, and removing obsolete references to the savings offset payments program in 
Dirigo Health.
Acting Superintendent Schott will be able to answer any questions you have. Thank you for your 
consideration.
