Testimony in Support of LD # 1041 An Act to Ensure Dental Insurance Coverage 
for Certain Adults with Disabilities 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services, 
 
My name is Stephanie Pelletier and I live in Fort Kent. I am a self-advocate, meaning I 
am a person who lives with a disability. I am also part of Speaking Up For Us, Maine’s 
Self-Advocacy Network and I am the Vice Chair on the Board of Directors.  
 
I am submitting this testimony in support because it is hard to get a dentist here in Fort 
Kent, Maine that will take Maine Care Coverage.  They are working on it but there are 
other places that take Maine Care coverage but there are long waitlists.   I feel like if I 
had dental coverage I would not have to wait as long or I would have other choices for a 
dentist.   
 
This bill is important to me because if I need dental work, I need to go on the waitlist to 
get it fixed.  If you wait until you get in it’s going to cost more in the long run.   Your 
cavity will just grow bigger.    
 
Passing this bill will help me and others get the dental services done when they need to 
get them done without being on a waiting list.   Not passing means it may cost too much 
to get dental work done or waiting with a sore mouth to be seen.   People will feel a lot 
worse in the future, and their health will get worse.  It will cost more.   
 
I urge you to vote in support of LD 1041.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Stephanie Pelletier
