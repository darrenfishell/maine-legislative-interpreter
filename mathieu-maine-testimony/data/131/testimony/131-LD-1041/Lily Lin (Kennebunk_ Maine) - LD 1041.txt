My daughter is severely disabled and has had sub par dental care for years.  I support 
this bill to allow dental insurance to cover them for as long as possible.  The issue, 
however, is that many, if not all, dental practices I have come across, do not provide 
dental care for the special needs population.  There is one practice that is 3.5 hours 
north, which is not feasible, otherwise we would have to cross state lines to 
Massachusetts which also would be completely out of pocket since its not covered by 
Mainecare.  Just the anesthesia that is necessary to do a simple filling costs upwards 
$3,000.  I am dreading the day we have to actually find a dentist that's willing to do 
the work.  We have been discharged from every pediatric practice in southern Maine 
because she is aged out or dentists have left the practice.  They have honestly said it is
not fiscally feasible for them to continue.  By the time they figure in the cost, time and
effort, it's easier for them to just not offer dental care to people with special needs.  
We are currently working with a small family owned office that is "cleaning" her 
teeth every 6 months and paying out of pocket for certain things that are not covered 
by Mainecare. But, they are not equipped to provide anything other than this most 
basic service.  Thank you for your attention to this deficit of service in our state of 
Maine.
