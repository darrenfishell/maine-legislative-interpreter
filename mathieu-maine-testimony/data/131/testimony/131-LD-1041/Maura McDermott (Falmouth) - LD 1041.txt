My name is Maura McDermott, and I live in Falmouth with my 18 year old daughter Olivia, 
who has Down syndrome. Despite maximizing her educational opportunities, Olivia will need 
financial and other assistance as an adult. I work and have dental insurance as part of my 
benefits package. I have always covered Olivia's health insurance and dental insurance 
needs. Anthem is her primary insurance, and MaineCare is her secondary. This benefits both 
Olivia and the State of Maine. 
It just makes sense to provide persons with disabilities the care that they need, which is 
available through their parents, as long as it is available. This should include dental coverage 
as well as health coverage.
 I went to a wake recently, and I noticed most of the people there, adults in their 40's and 50's
had no front teeth. Maine has very poor dental care available to its citizens. Shouldn't we 
allow parents who have these benefits to extend them to their children? Why force another 
burden on the adult with the disability? Isn't just living with the disability enough?
Let's make their life a little bit easier...Give them something to smile about. Extend the dental 
insurance age for adults with disabilities.
