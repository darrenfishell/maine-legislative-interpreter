Testimony in Support of LD # 1041 An Act to Ensure Dental Insurance Coverage 
for Certain Adults with Disabilities 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services 
 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate, meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. I am submitting this testimony in support because I 
think all people need to have dental insurance.   
 
For many individuals, to stay on their parents’ dental insurance plan would be a benefit 
to them because they would have better dental insurance.  They would not have to be 
concerned if a place does not accept Maine Care as a dental insurance.  For many 
people dental insurance is a barrier to going to the dentist.   
 
I urge you to vote in support of LD 1041.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,
