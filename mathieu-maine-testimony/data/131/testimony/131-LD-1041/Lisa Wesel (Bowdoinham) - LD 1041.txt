LD 1041
To the members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Service Committee:
My name is Lisa Wesel, I live in Bowdoinham, and I am the mother of a 26-year-old 
daughter with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
I would like to speak in favor of LD 1041, An Act to Ensure Dental Insurance 
Coverage for Certain Adults with Disabilities.
Dental healthcare is as important as regular healthcare … for everyone. It’s 
unfortunate that our healthcare system separates the two as if your mouth is somehow 
not part of your body. Maintaining good oral health is particularly important for 
adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities because they tend to have poor 
oral hygiene and poor diets, and problems frequently go undiagnosed until they reach 
a critical level.
Here’s what happens: An adult with IDD starts experiencing pain from a cavity. They 
don’t have the physical awareness to pinpoint exactly where the pain is coming from, 
or perhaps they lack the communication skills to tell a caregiver that it hurts when 
they chew. So they stop eating, and they begin to express themselves in the one way 
they know how – with what you would consider bad behavior. They might become 
agitated or violent. Imagine what it would feel like if you were in constant pain, that 
you didn’t understand and couldn’t make anyone else understand.
If they had regular access to dental checkups, problems would never reach that level.
Allowing adults with IDD to continue receiving dental care under their parents’ 
insurance is the humane thing to do.
