LD 877
I support LD 877 and preventing the State of Maine from contracting with Chinese 
companies.  
Here are just a few examples of how China has recently demonstrated that they are 
threat to the safety & security of Maine and the United States:
1.) The invasion of U.S airspace with unmanned spy craft
2.) Lying to the World Health Organization (WHO), stating that COVID-19 was 
non-transmissible to humans in the beginning of the pandemic.
3.) Lying about the construction of artificial islands being used as military bases in the South 
China Sea
4.) Chinese telephone company "Huawei" committing corporate espionage on US soil.
