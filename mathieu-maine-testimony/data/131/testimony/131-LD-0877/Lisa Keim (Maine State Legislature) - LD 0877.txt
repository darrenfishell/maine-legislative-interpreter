Testimony of Senator Lisa Keim before the Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 
LD 8'77, An Act to Prohibit State Contracts with Companies Owned or Operated by the 
Government of the People's Republic of China 
March 21, 2023 
Good Afternoon Senator Nangle, Representative Stover and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on State and Local Government. I am Lisa Keim, and I proudly represent the citizens of 
Senate District 19, which includes much of Northern Oxford County and 15 communities in Franklin 
County. I am proud to sponsor LD 877, “An Act to Prohibit State Contracts with Companies Owned or 
Operated by the Government of the People's Republic of China.” 
The People’s Republic of China has always been a threat to national security, but there is renewed 
public interest in protecting against their interference. Federal policy directs information security at 
the federal level, and states must also determine their own security standards. 
Making headlines through Huawei, ZTE in 5G networks, and TikTok, China is well known for 
collecting massive amount of information on US Citizens, and for stealing intellectual property, but 
they are also targeting our Govermnent at every level, Federal, State and Local. 
China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law mandates Chinese government access to information collected 
by equipment that is produced by Chinese-owned companies, and the disclosure of that data to the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) upon request. This law requires network operators, including all 
companies headquartered in China, to store select data within the country and allow Chinese 
authorities to do “spot-checks ” on a company’s network operations. Chinese companies have no 
choice- they must provide an information pipeline for the CCP. 
Recognizing part of the risk, as of February 2023, MaineIT banned the social networking service 
TikTok from all state-issued or Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) mobile devices comiected to state 
equipment and systems. The Directive states that Maine must keep pace with rapidly evolving national 
security risks to infrastructure, “including the sensitive and conﬁdential information that we are 
entrusted to protect for our citizens? ” 
However, if Chinese technology is being used anywhere in our state government, the CCP has access 
to our private information upon request. Maine is vulnerable in at least in one known way: Lenovo 
laptops which are used throughout State Govermnent. 
According to Maine Open CheckBook, between 2015 and 2023, the state of Maine spent $5,3 50,803 
on Chinese technology from Lenovo, Inc. In fact, the computers currently used by Legislative staff are 
Lenovo. This is extremely concerning because through Lenovo, depending on which state agencies are 
using these PCs, the CCP can access personal information held by courts, police departments, elections

Q1: Why does this bill single out China alone? 
A1: The disturbing fact is, no other foreign adversary controls large tech companies that hold such signiﬁcant 
market share to support their global ambitions. China’s 2017 Internet Security Law gives the Chinese government 
access to information collected by equipment provided by Chinese-owned companies and the disclosure of that data 
to the Chinese Communist Party upon request. If vulnerable technology is being used anywhere by a state, this 
could mean the Chinese government could have access to information. To be clear, this bill does not apply to 
private companies. Private American companies should not be punished or penalized for making risky purchases 
unknowingly when these government-affiliated Chinese companies have created quite an ownership labyrinth to 
disguise their government connections. 
Q2: What will it cost taxpayers to enact this legislation. 
A2: There are negligible administrative costs associated with reviewing certifications and this cost could be offset 
by ﬁnes issued when the state’s purchasing agency determines that a company has submitted a false certiﬁcation. 
However, such protections help support business growth and attract new businesses to states that know their 
security concerns are being addressed. 
Q3: How should we address the millions Maine has already spent on Lenovo products which would cost a lot 
to replace? 
A3: The main purpose of this bill is to stop any new purchases of this risky China-owned technology. Yes, Maine 
has already spent money on this risky tech and “rip and replace” comes at a cost to taxpayers. Unfortunately, that 
technology already in use will need to be addressed, but that should not be a factor to slow down passage of this 
bill. If anything, it is a reason to pass it swiftly. 
Q4: Does this bill apply to private companies? 
A4: No. Private American companies should not be penalized for unknowingly purchasing equipment from 
government-affiliated Chinese companies, as they are frequently disguised by American subsidiaries. 
Q5: What defense & intelligence agencies have banned the kinds of companies that will be restricted by this 
legislation? 
A5: ln July 2019 the Department of Defense Inspector General highlighted some $33 million in purchases by the 
Pentagon of commercial off the shelf (COTS) Lexmark and Lenovo products, which have been noted on the 
National Vulnerability Database because of security deficiencies. Like Huawei and ZTE, Lexmark and Lenovo are 
Chinese-owned and banned by multiple military and intelligence agencies in the U.S. and around the globe. 
Q6: If these products have been banned by defense & intelligence agencies, why are states, local 
governments, & schools still buying them? 
A6: While federal policy directs information security for federal agencies, states determine their own information 
security standards. There is no central state/local vetting agency, so states & local governments just don’t have the 
expertise and know the risk. Furthermore, the National Association of State Procurement Officers 
(NASPO), which is regarded as the “gate keeper” for state government purchasing across the United States, does 
not account for security vulnerabilities. 
Q7: Should this bill be limited to China, or should it also apply to other countries, like Russia, for example? 
A7: This bill builds off of identiﬁed threats and restrictions that already exist at the federal level to bolster our 
defense again a country that has national laws created to take advantage of backdoor access to sensitive American 
data. That doesn’t mean to say we shouldn’t take a close look at how it could be applied to other adversarial 
nations, but that consideration should not slow our efforts already underway to hold of China right now.
