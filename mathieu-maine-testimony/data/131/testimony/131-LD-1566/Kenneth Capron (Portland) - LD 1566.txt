TOP 10 reasons to support LD 1351 as amended to include SkyWay by MicroRail  
1. Climate impact – net eliminati on of  most of the 54% GHG caused by the 
current transportation system in Maine . 
2. Climate impact – generation of millions of Kw of solar energy  limited only 
by how far and how fast the infrastructure can be deployed.  
3. Transit  – eliminates over $ 10,000,000 in annual subsidies paid for c urrent 
transit services by towns and the state.  Also eliminates Fe deral subsidies 
for infrastructure and operations of all forms of trans it. 
4. Education – replaces the need for  and 100% cost of school buses with a 
24/7/365 , all-weather , safer, faster, driverless and maintenance free 
alternative . 
5. Safety - vehicular and pedestr ian Deaths and Injuries from Accidents are 
eliminated.  
6. DEI – SkyWay services  all populations equally with zero or near -zero 
transportation including disabled and underprivileged.  
7. Conge stion – reduces or eliminates congestion at street level  including 
idling at stoplights and rail crossings.   
8. Productivity – autonomous operation allows for safer and better  
utilization o f time lost to commuting . 
9. Public safety – SkyWay eliminates drunk driving, distracted driving, health 
related driving hazar ds, speeding, road rage, drivers ’ licenses, annual 
inspections, road kill, hitch -hiking , and more.  
10.  Consumer costs – no more insurance, inspections, car pa yments, 
breakdowns, $10K annual cost of ow nership  (AAA ), and more.  
If this isn ’t enough to justify the SkyWay system, consider the benefits of four 
new manufacturing pl ants , new jobs, advanced engin eering and training.
