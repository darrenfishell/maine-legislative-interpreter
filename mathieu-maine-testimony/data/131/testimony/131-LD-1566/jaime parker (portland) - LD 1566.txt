LD 1566
Honorable Representatives;
I am writing to urge you to SUPPORT LD 1566 to make our streets safer for all of us.
We MUST take real action to reverse the trend of increasing vehicle crashes, and 
death and injury on our public roads.  We have a right to safe streets!
LD 1566 is a good start.
Thank you,
Jaime Parker
Portland
