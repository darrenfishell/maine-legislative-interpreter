LD 1566
Dear Senator Chipman and Representative Williams,
I would like to offer my strong support to LD 1566. I live in Portland, less than a 
block from Forest Avenue, one of the busiest and most unnecessarily unsafe streets in 
Maine. Like many places in Maine, our lives as residents, cyclists, pedestrians and 
parents are put at risk every day by people who drive cars wrecklessly, inattentively, 
or with the intention to intimidate. Even my own neighborhood street regularly sees 
drivers cutting between Brighton and Forest to skip a traffic light, exceeding the 
speed limit by 20 miles per hour. 
No one should have to tell their children they can't cross the street to visit a friend or 
get a pack of gum. These things were already risky when I was growing up in 
Rosemont three decades ago. Private automobiles and their drivers have only gotten 
more dangerous since then. If a driver can barely see me in front of the grill of an 
F-150, how are they going to see my 5 and 8 year olds? 
We need this Task Force to direct the state on how to make our streets safer, with 
solutions that have proven to work in other places and countries. If its possible to 
have zero traffic deaths in European cities that are 5-10 times larger than Portland, 
such as Gotthenberg, Sweden (population 550,000), why is it not possible here? Are 
we so incapable of doing better? I believe we can, and this bill will help us get there.
