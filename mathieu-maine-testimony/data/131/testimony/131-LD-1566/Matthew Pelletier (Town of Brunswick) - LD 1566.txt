This testimony is in favor of: LD 1566 - Resolve, to Establish the Task Force to 
Recommend Strategies to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating Traffic Fatalities and 
Serious Injuries.
While Maine and The Department of Transportation as well as other organizations 
and entities are working towards a safer future, I believe establishing a task force is 
the most effective and efficient way to address traffic accidents and fatalities. The 
task force would welcome members of the community, State of Maine employees, 
experts and other members of the public to take a strong well rounded approach to 
safe mobility guided by Vision Zero and Safe System Approach. While the state 
implements certain aspects of Vision Zero, they have mostly adopted the Toward 
Zero Deaths (TZD) approach, which has its own merits but focuses on individual 
behavior rather than an equitable approach that also considers social and economic 
factors such as land use, poverty, transportation access, and equity. Transportation 
mobility is closely tied to almost every aspect of our community and to truly achieve 
zero deaths, I believe we should explore the root principles that guide us in our 
everyday lives. You canâ€™t build a roof without building the foundation first and a 
diverse task force will help the state build a strong foundation to achieve safer 
mobility. Many other communities throughout the Country have implemented VIsion 
Zero and been successful, why not follow their lead?
