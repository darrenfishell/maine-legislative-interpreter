Hello,
Thank you for letting me have this opportunity to comment. 
Since WW2 we have allowed a sort of pattern of development called sprawl. That has
been the main focus for decades at this point. 
Just recently we, as a country, have started to become a bit more mindful of the 
damage this type of development causes. 
The more that someone needs to use a vehicle to get what they need, the more our 
carbon footprint increases. 
We widen our streets to accommodate more and more cars. Most of the time at the 
expense of other forms of transport, like bikes and skateboards and even walking. 
Our streets have become a place for cars and not much else. 
This task force that is being proposed before you all in this bill would help to restore a
balance between cars and the people and would make for a more livable and friendly 
community environment, that is safer and more beautiful than a sea of asphalt, and 
would make cities and towns more financially strong as a result. 
Restoring the balance between cars and people is one key to being proud of where one
resides and this task force would help that to occur.
To be able to have a child walk to school again, or play at the park without fears of 
being run over due to wide streets that's not truly safe for adults to cross, let alone 
children. 
The happier the people. The more prosperous the town. 
And this task force could go a long way to making a happy life for many Maine 
residents. 
Thank you so much for your time,
Don McCann
