To Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation:
Yesterday, April 23rd, marked 7 years since we lost my little brother, Tom. He was 
hit by a drunk driver while he was out for a bike ride. He was killed instantly. 
These past 7 years I have tried to understand a completely senseless tragedy. What is 
clear is that Tom’s death was not just a personal tragedy for my family, it’s part of a 
pattern of destruction that can be prevented. The US has higher rates of traffic deaths 
as compared to our peer nations AND deaths continue to rise. 
I long for the day when we don’t have this much dying on our roadways. I think of the
lives we can save, the grieving we can prevent. I also think about the other 
opportunities we can unlock if our streets were safe. Imagine, more children playing 
outside, people walking or exercising more to prevent illness, neighborhoods and 
communities strengthened, older people and people with disabilities integrated into 
our communities, businesses supported because more people, customers and workers 
alike, find them accessible. There’s so much we are losing because people fear 
walking and biking on the street.  
I’ve become an advocate in my local community for pedestrian and bike safety. 
There’s no question that people agree these are serious issues and we need to address 
them. What is evident however, is there is not consensus on HOW to achieve safety. 
Adopting Vision Zero and a safe systems approach is a good first step. A task force of
experts to make recommendations through a public process will be an act of 
leadership in our state. The task force can make clear recommendations to make our 
streets safer. 
Please pass this bill to make our streets safer for everyone. The pain and suffering of 
bereaved families is preventable; let’s work together to ensure no one has to go 
through the hardship of losing their loved ones.
