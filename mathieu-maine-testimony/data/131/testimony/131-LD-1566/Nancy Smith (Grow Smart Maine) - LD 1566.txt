Testimony of Nancy Smith, Executive Director of GrowSmart Maine 
In support of LD 1556 A Resolve to Establish a Vision Zero Task Force to 
Recommend Strategies to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating Traffic Fatalities 
and Serious Injuries 
April 25, 2023 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation, 
My name is Nancy Smith, I live in Ellsworth, and I am the CEO of GrowSmart Maine. 
We are a statewide non-partisan non-proﬁt organization helping communities navigate 
change in alignment with smart growth. We advocate for comprehensive policies and 
funding for smart growth practices and outcomes. 
We have partnered with Build Maine to guide a transparent crowd—sourcing of policy 
proposals that began a year ago, and has drawn together over a hundred people from 
across Maine and beyond. This testimony represents the view of Build Maine as well as 
GrowSmart Maine. Attached is a list of Policy Action 2023 legislative proposals. 
Policy Action 2023 has resulted in sixteen proposals from eight working groups, all 
addressing this goal, “to address barriers to and create incentives for 
equitable, sustainable growth and development that strengthens 
downtowns and villages of all sizes while pulling development pressure 
away from productive and open natural areas. We do so acknowledging 
that Maine has urban, rural, and suburban settings for which any 
solution may or may not be a ﬁt and a variety of people who deserve to be 
welcomed to their communities. ” 
This Resolve establishes a state-level task force to lead Maine in building a strong, 
actionable foundation for safe mobility. It does so by: 
0 Developing a comprehensive and coordinated action plan for Maine including 
short-term and long-term strategies with measurable goals and target dates. 
0 Promoting effective, transparent collection and dissemination of trafﬁc safety 
data. 
0 Providing recommendations for changes to state, county, and municipal street 
design standards, state laws and municipal ordinances. 
Please refer to the attached fact sheet for an overview of the positive impacts this 
proposal will have across Maine. GrowSmart Maine and Build Maine will assist the 
committee in any way that is helpful.

OVERVIEW: What does the bill do? 
This Resolve establishes a state-level task force to lead 
Maine in building a strong, actionable foundation for safe 
mobility. The task force will convene a public process 
guided by Vision Zero - which acknowledges that even 
one death on our transportation system is unacceptable. 
Vision Zero focuses on safe mobility for all road users, 
through policies and system design rather than individual 
behavior. The approach is being successfully used in 
hundreds of states and municipalities. 
The task force will identify the most effective actions to 
eliminate trafﬁc deaths and serious injuries through: 
O Developing a comprehensive and coordinated action 
plan for Maine including short-term and long-term 
strategies with measurable goals and target dates. 
0 Promoting effective and transparent collection and 
dissemination of trafﬁc safety data. 
0 Providing recommendations for changes to state, 
county, and municipal street design standards, state 
laws and municipal ordinances.A 
The task force will be composed of 22 members, including 
legislators, representatives from state agencies, 
professionals from the private sector, and members of the 
public sector with direct experience in trafﬁc safety-related 
incidents. The Task Force is intended to have an ongoing 
role as an advisory body to MaineDOT and municipalities. 
PROS: 
I The resolve gives Maine access to the most effective 
tools for preventing injuries and deaths. Vision Zero 
strategies have been used for 25 years and proven to 
be effective in reducing crashes. 
0 This resolve aligns Maine with the Federal Highway 
Administration's . and 
positions Maine to leverage more funding through the 
federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Safe 
System Approach focuses on both human mistakes 
AND human vulnerability and designs a system with 
many redundancies in place to protect everyone. 1

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES: 
There may be resistance to this bill because of the 
perception that Maine has already adopted Vision Zero 
strategies. However, Maine has been using the Toward 
Zero Deaths (TDZ) approach, not Vision Zero. The two 
approaches are NOT the same. TDZ is more centered on 
individual behaviors and lacks discussion of important 
contexts that impact human behavior such as land use, 
access to a vehicle, or poverty that may impact the mode 
choice or behaviors of people in different communities 
beyond the design of a road in its strategy. 
IMPACTS: Why does it matter? 
Equity: The task force will focus on safety for the most 
vulnerable communities including households with no 
vehicle, older adults, people with disabilities, single-parent 
families, and severely rent-burdened households. 
Transportation Safety and Choice: Maine people love to 
walk and bike, but increasingly people feel unsafe on our 
roads. lf we want to increase transportation choice, we 
must make Maine roads safer for everyone. 
Climate Action: Slowing trafﬁc in activity centers enables 
more people to walk, bike, and roll for day-to-day trips, 
which reduces vehicle miles traveled. 
Fiscal health: This bill will lead to slower speeds in areas 
where people live and run businesses, increasing real 
estate values and retail activity, directly increasing local tax 
base. 
Economic Development: This bill will allow municipalities 
to slow vehicle speeds in downtowns and village centers, 
where it is critical for people to feel safe and comfortable 
walking in order to conveniently and efficiently access 
shops and businesses. Data shows slower safer streets 
increase retail sales, economic activity, and investment. 
Quality of Life: Safe streets are a critical factor for 
enabling Mainers to be physically active and socially 
connected in their communities.
