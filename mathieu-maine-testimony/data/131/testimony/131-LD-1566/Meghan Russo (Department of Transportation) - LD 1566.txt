Testimony of Meghan Russo 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131“ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
In Opposition to 1566 
Resolve, to Establish the Task F orce to Recommend Strategies to Achieve the Goal of 
Eliminating T rafﬁc Fatalities and Serious Injuries 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, I am Meghan Russo, Manager of Legislative and Constituent Services for 
MaineDOT. MaineDOT respectfully opposes LD 1566, Resolve, to Establish the Task F orce to 
Recommend Strategies to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating Traﬁic Fatalities and Serious Injuries. 
While we certainly support the goals stated in this Resolve, this legislation is duplicative in many 
ways, and umiecessary. MaineDOT has adopted a “Driving Toward Zero Deaths” philosophy 
using the “Safe System Approach ” which includes: 
0 Encouraging safer road users, 
0 Expanding safer vehicle systems and technologies, 
0 Promoting safer speeds through context-appropriate roadway design, 
0 Designing safer roadways and, 
0 Improving post-crash care. 
Deaths as well as serious injuries are the focus areas of the Safe System Approach. 
There is a multi-agency group called the Maine Transportation Safety Coalition who help 
develop the Strategic Highway Safety Plan that includes 15 focus areas with a much more 
detailed set of nested strategies for 2023. This along with our internal Speed Zone Group are 
undertaking much of the work envisioned for this proposed Task Force..

We have signiﬁcant concerns that a new group such as the one being proposed would pull the 
focus away for these practitioners from their important work implementing the Strategic 
Highway Safety Plan. 
It is for these reasons that we oppose LD 1566. Thank you and I am happy to try to answer any 
questions you may have.
