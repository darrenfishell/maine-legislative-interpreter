Gorham
LD 1450
My name is Jane Bennett, I live in Gorham Maine, I am writing in support of LD 404 
to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Jane Bennett
