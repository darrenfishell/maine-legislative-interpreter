Esteemed Chairman and members of the Transportation Committee:
my name is Isabel Higgins and I am writing in support of LD 1405 which will provide
a funding mechanism for LD 404, to transition the Mountain Division Trail  as 
recommended  into a multi use, multi-generational site for outdoor activities including
walking, biking. running, and stroller use.   I strongly urge you to recommend it 
"ought to pass."   Thank you for your time and consideration.
