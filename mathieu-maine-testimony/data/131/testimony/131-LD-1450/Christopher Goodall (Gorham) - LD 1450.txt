LD 1450
My name is Chris Goodall, I live in Gorham, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham.  As a member of the 
Presumpscot Regional Land Trust, I understand the value that this investment brings 
to our communities.  Please strongly consider the passage of this initiative.
Thank you,
Chris Goodall
