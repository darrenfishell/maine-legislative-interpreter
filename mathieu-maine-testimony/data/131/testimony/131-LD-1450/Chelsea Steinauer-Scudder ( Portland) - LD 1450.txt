LD 1450
I am writing to share my enthusiastic support of LD404 and LD1450. As a resident of 
Portland, ME and part of a family committed to cycling and enjoying all of the 
outdoor opportunities Maine has to offer, I am excited about the potential this trail has
to expand biking access to members of the Maine community. Rail trails have 
demonstrated benefits for human health and local economies, and contribute 
positively to Maine's climate goals
