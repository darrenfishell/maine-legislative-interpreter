it is important for peoples safety to complete this rail trail.  I ride my bike often and 
now am too afraid to ride on route 114, in Standish, and other main roads.  the 
distracted driving is out of control and I have almost gotten hit, recently, many times. 
We need this trail for future generations and now, for our safety and for our health.  
this would be so good for walkers and bikers.  the trail is scenic and would benefit the
towns and its peoples greatly.  Please make this happen  Thank you
