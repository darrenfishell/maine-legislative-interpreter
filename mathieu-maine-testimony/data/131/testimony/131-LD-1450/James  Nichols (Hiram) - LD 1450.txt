James  Nichols
Hiram
LD 1450
My name is James Nichols.  I live in Hiram, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities.  I would like to be able to spend time with family and friends 
on the trail, commute to work and enjoy nature.
Thank you,
James Nichols
