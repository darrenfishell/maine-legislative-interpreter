Please do not allow special interests to destroy one of our last remaining rail 
corridors.   This railway would should be restored for both passenger and freight 
service.   It was the intention of past governors to do this with the restoration of 4 
miles of track in Westbrook.  We should be allowing green transportation to take hold
in Western Maine and improve the economy and reduce fuel use and pollution and 
carbon emissions by restoring rail services.   We should not allow cyclists to take a 
critical asset so an elite few can ride bikes.  We must restore the whole corridor for 
rail.  We could have a vibrant economy with rail services including ski trains, freight 
services, and passenger services through the most congested part of the entire state.  It
would be a travesty to allow the tracks to be ripped up and destroyed.   We tried this 
in Downeast Maine and now there is nothing but poverty.  Do not allow this to 
happen.
