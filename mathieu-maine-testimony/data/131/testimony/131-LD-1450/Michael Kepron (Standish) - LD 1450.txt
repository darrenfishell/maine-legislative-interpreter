LD 1450
My name is Michael Kepron and Iâ€™m a Standish resident.  I am writing in support of 
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and  LD 1450 to 
help fund the building of the trail. I believe that the best use for the state-owned 
Mountain Division corridor is a paved trail for walkers, cyclists, and runners, 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities.  As a Standish resident, I strongly 
support increased access to local cycling trails in particular, given the unfortunate lack
of safe, family-friendly cycling terrain currently available.  I urge you to support 
funding for the expansion of the rail-trail from the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail in Gorham and Windham, into Standish and west to Fryeburg, where a 
four-mile rail-trail section also already exists.
Thanks for the work you're doing!
Michael Kepron
