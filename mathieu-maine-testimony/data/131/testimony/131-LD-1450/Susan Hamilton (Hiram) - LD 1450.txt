LD 1450
I am writing to encourage support of LD 1450. Providing safe spaces for all people 
and families to recreate safely should be a priority. It is necessary for our physical and
mental health. And if it is nearby and convenient, more will avail themselves of the 
opportunity. My husband and I have transported our bikes to Brownfield to pick up 
the trail on occasion, but we would get on the trail more often if it ran through Hiram. 
Having a longer continuous trail will bring more people to the area and may 
encourage new small businesses to set up shop along the route such as lunch spots, 
bike shops, etc. Please support the funding for this important bill.
