LD 1450
My name is Barry Dikeman, and I live part-time in Portland, Maine and part-time in 
Lovell, Maine and, I am writing in support of LD 1450 to help fund the building of 
the trail and LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail. 
Currently, the corridor/right-of-way is not serving it's intended purpose which was/is 
to connect Maine communities and promote economic growth in the State of Maine. 
The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for 
walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Barry Dikeman
