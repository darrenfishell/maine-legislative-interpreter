LD 1450
My name is John Weston, I live in Fryeburg, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. 
The Fryeburg section of the MDT has had a significant impact on our community in 
both recreation for our residences and attracting visitors from surrounding regions.  
Further connecting the trail to other communities will only continue to add these same
opportunities and add significant value to all of Western Maine.     
Thank you,
John Weston
