LD 1450
My name is Emily Farr, and I live in Westbrook. I'm writing in support of LD 1450 to
help fund the building of the Mountain Division corridor into a trail. This would 
expand the existing and highly used rail trail network that exists in the region, and is 
an exciting opportunity to create a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners. 
Many of the paved biking routes in the area are currently along roads with no or 
minimal shoulder, and speed limits that pose risks for bikers. A paved, off-road trail 
like the Mountain Division corridor would provide safe and much-needed 
opportunities for biking in the area. I strongly urge you to vote ought to pass.
Thank you,
Emily
