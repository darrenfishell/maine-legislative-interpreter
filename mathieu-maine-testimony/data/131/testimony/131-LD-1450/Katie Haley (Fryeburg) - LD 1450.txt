RE: LD 1450 - An Act to Fund  the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory 
Council  
 
Dear Committee,  
 
I am writing on behalf of the Town of Fryeburg to express support of LD 1450 .  Fryeburg is lucky to 
have a 4 -mile section of rail trail in our tow n.  We see daily use of the trail  throughout the seasons and 
while we have not conducted actual surveys, it certainly appears as though the use of the rail trail 
increases each year. It gets used by walkers, runners, bicyclists, cross country skiers, and snowmobilers.  
It has been the location of annual foot races and events that  promote bicycle safety  and is a source of 
pride for the Town.  
 
We are setting aside funds  to keep our section of trail looking good and have  further funding efforts to 
improve connectivity efforts recreational assets and businesses .  This summer we are going to be 
constructing a 1 -mile portion of sidewalk that will lead from the rail trai l to our village area which 
houses local shops and restaurants.  Fryeburg voters have suppo rted these funding efforts locally  and i t 
is very exciting to think that this notion of connectivity can expand to other towns in our region, 
allowing for increased recreational and economic opportunities  for all towns.  
 
Please fund the recommendations of the Mountain Divisio n Rail Use Advisory .  
 
Regards,  
 
Katie Haley  
Town Manager
