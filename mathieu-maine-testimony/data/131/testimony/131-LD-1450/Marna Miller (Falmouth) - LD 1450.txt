Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and members of the Transportation 
Committee: 
My name is Mama Miller. I’m a 22-year resident of F almouth, and I’m here to 
strongly support LD209. (I also support LD404 and LD1450.) 
My family enjoys biking and would use the proposed rail trail for recreation, 
health, and transportation. An off-road trail running through our town would bring 
a lot of value to us individually, but today I want to talk about the economic value 
it would bring to our community. Studies show trails boost spending at local 
businesses. 
Earlier this month, my husband and I loaded our bikes on the car for a spontaneous 
getaway. We looked for a location with safe biking routes. After dismissing 
multiple areas in and out of state where roads had little shoulder, we settled on 
Acadia National Park, with its 45 miles of off-road carriage trails. 
In addition to two nights at a hotel, we spent $300 on meals, coffee, a park pass,a 
book, and of course ice cream. That’s more than $600 that we spent in Bar Harbor 
that weekend solely because of the existence of off-road bike trails. And this was in 
the off season, when some businesses and attractions are still closed. Tourists are 
not guaranteed in Bar Harbor in May, but the off-road bike trails drew us there. 
Because I live in Falmouth and could use the proposed rail trail without having to 
book a hotel, I wouldn’t spend that kind of money when using the path. But other 
people absolutely would. One study of a 62-mile rail trail in Pennsylvania showed 
non-local users spent an average of $99.30 per visit. Meanwhile, local users like 
me also make purchases in towns along the way. On local rides, I’ve purchased 
food, drinks, bike gear, admission to events, even a raincoat. Support LD209 to 
allow Auburn, Falmouth, and so many other contiguous communities to beneﬁt 
from bicyclists ’ dollars. 
Thank you for your time.
