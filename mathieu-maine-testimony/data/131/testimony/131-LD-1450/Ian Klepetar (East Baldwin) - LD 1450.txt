After arriving to the area 2 years ago, I began using 113 to get from East Baldwin to 
Portland for work or to the White Mountains to play.  Unlike most people in the area, 
I don't own a car and rely on a bicycle to commute to the city or roll to the mountains.
I've witnessed first hand a cyclist getting struck and severely injured on this 
incredibly dangerous corridor.  I use a mirror, lights, a reflective vest and do a great 
job communicating with motorists.  That being said, the Maine DOT has 
inadvertently built a highway that is mortifying and extremely dangerous to ride on.  
Before long, another person is going to die or become severely injured on this 
corridor.  Without providing a safe alternative for bicyclists, the State of Maine is 
asking vulnerable road users to ride in a 55 mph. roadway with little-to-no shoulder in
many stretches.  However, this can be avoided if the transportation committee 
recognizes the urgent need to provide immediate funding to move forward with the 
Mountain Division Trail that countless individuals support.  This corridor could 
quickly become a world-class connection to work, natural beauty and rural health.  
Thanks for supporting this wonderful opportunity!
