I would rather not have this section of the old mountain division torn up. The way the 
fuels prices are, what a better what to reduce carbon footprint. You have train 
excursions from Portland to North Conway and back. Also do freight service for the 
same area. I know of at least 3-4 in the Fryeburg area that would use the if the line 
was reactivated. I think if Conway Scenic Railroad was approached they would 
probably take this on for service to keep this line open.
