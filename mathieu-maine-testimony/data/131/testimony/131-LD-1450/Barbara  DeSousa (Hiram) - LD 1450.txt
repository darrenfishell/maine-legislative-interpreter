LD 1450
My name is Barbara DeSousa. I live in Hiram, Maine. I am writing in support of of 
LD404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a rail trail and LD1450 to 
help fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state owned Mountain Division
corridor is a wide paved trail for walker, bikers, and runners of all ages and abilities. 
This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail -trail that 
already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Barbara
