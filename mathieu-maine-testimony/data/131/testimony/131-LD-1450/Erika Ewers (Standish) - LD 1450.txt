I think having a biking trail from Standish to Fryeburg is an outstanding idea. I love 
bike riding. It don’t ever go out because the roads aren’t safe to ride bikes on and I get
bored riding in an empty parking lot. There’s a similar trail in Mass that goes from 
Bedford almost all the way into Boston and all kinds of people jog, bike walk or 
rollerblade along it. There are so many people that would benefit from this trail. 
Families, athletes, average joes looking to improve their health, senior citizens 
looking to stay active, teenagers. Please please please make this trail happen.
