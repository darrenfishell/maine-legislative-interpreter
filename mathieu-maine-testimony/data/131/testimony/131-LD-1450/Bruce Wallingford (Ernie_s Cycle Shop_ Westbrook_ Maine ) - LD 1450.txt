Hello, During the Winter I have used the Mountain Division Trail Corridor to ride my
Fat bike to the White  Mountains several times. I bought food, and paid for lodging. 
When this trail gets built I will do this several times a year. And so will thousands of 
other people many from all over the world. It will become an economic driver.
