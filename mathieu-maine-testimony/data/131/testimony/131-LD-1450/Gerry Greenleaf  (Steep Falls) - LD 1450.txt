My name is Gerry Greenleaf, I live in Steep Falls and my wife and I are supporters of our State of Maine natural beauty and unique outdoor spaces. As healthy seniors, my wife and I really enjoy hiking and biking the various trails we have across our state. We currently regularly use the 9 miles of the existing Mountain Division Trails in Fryeburg and Windham/Gorham. By connecting the two sections to increase the availability and access for enjoying our great outdoor requires investing in transitioning unused rail beds into paved wide trails that can be used by walkers, runners, and bicyclists of all ages and ability. From my understanding, expanding the Mountain Division Trail from Standish to Fryeburg will enable over 300,000 people annually to enjoy the hidden beauty of Maine. I am asking for support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and for LD 1450 to fund the building of the trail. 
Thank you
Gerry and Carolyn Greenleaf
