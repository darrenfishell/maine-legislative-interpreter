   WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF “LD 404” and “LD 1450”
Rail trails are gifts to their communities.  This I believe based on my experience bike 
riding on trails along the Mountain Division corridor (Fryeburg, Gorham, Windham) 
and along the Eastern Trail (South Portland, Scarborough, Saco, Kennebnnk), and 
across the United States.
My name is Peter Zack.  I am 76 and live in Porter and am writing in enthusiastic 
support of both LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and
LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail.
My wife and I are not hard-core bicyclists.  We are, rather, dilettantes for whom 15 
miles represent a pretty good outing. Benefits?  Well, biking provides great exercise 
and a terrific way to observe and enjoy a part of our world not normally seen through 
the windows of an automobile.  How uplifting it is to encounter other folks of all ages
on the trail, not just biking, but walking, running, roller skating and pushing baby 
carriages .Build it and they will come, indeed!  And have I mentioned safety?  Years 
ago I was hit by a car while riding on a road in my community.  I am NOT going back
there.
In the spring of 2022 my wife and I took a two month car-camping trip across the 
country and back.  We took our hiking poles---and our bikes.  We sampled bike trails 
from New York (Dutchess Rail Trail) to Virginia (Capital Trail)) and from Idaho 
(Trail of the Coeur d’Helene) to Minnesota (Paul Bunyan Trail).  To the benefits of 
rail trails mentioned above I would add: Economic Drivers. On our travels we saw 
bike shops, eateries, lodging, and campgrounds which had sprung up along the bike 
routes to accommodate folks wheeling through.
I believe that rail trails are one of the most exciting ideas birthed in his country in the 
past three decades.  Let’s keep the momentum going!
