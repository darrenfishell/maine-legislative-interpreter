LD 1450
Hello,
My name is Wendy Haskell, I live in Windham, Maine. I am writing in support of LD
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. I believe the best use for the state-owned Mountain 
Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to 
people of all ages and abilities. I live in South Windham about 4 miles away from the 
Plummer Road access point to the existing trail. I ride my bicycle to the trail at least 
weekly from spring to fall. Riding on the roads is a bit of a risk to cyclists mostly I 
believe because of so many distracted drivers out there. Riding the rail trails feels 
SAFE. Last summer I got my brother to join me and now he loves this trail almost as 
much as I do. He drives from Skowhegan to my home in Windham to bike with me. 
We have gone to the South Windham end past Gambo Road to Route 202 and back to
the Standish end. Last year we rode it many times and I've been riding it already this 
year. I will be 67 years old in a matter of days and riding this trail keeps me fit and 
reminds me of how much I loved riding a bike as a youth. I take my 5 grandchildren 
riding with me when they come to visit, something they love as well. This trail 
extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division rail-trail that already 
exists in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Wendy Haskell
