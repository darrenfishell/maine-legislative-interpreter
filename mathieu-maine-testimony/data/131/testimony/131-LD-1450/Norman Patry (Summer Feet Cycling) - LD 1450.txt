LD 1450
I an writing to encourage the fowarding/passage of LD 1450. Outdoor recreation is a 
major force for the Maine Economy and anything the state can do to create more 
opportunities to visit and recreate in Maine is good for the economy. In addition, 
multi-use trails increase property values nearby and create new opportunities for 
Maine businesses to grow.
