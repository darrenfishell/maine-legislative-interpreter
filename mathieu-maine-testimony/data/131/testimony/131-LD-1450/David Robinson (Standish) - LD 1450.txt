David Robinson
Standish
LD 1450
My name is David Robinson and am a resident of Steep Falls. (Standish)  I support 
passage of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 
1450 to help fund the building of the trail.
I am a frequent user of the Eastern Trail in Scarborough and an occasional user of the 
Windham – Standish Mt Division trail.. and also the Fryeburg section of the trail.
These converted rails to trails provide wonderful opportunities for me, my children 
and grandchildren to safely bike the Maine outdoors. Otherwise, there are no safe 
places for us to ride. If built, we’d be able to access the trail in Steep Falls and ride all
day without competing with auto and truck traffic.. and get great exercise as well.
I’ve lived in Steep Falls for 45 years. There are very few job opportunities out here.. 
and fewer still as you travel west and north. The trail would provide a much needed 
boost to the local economies in the rural towns along the trails. Bike rentals?  Bed & 
breakfasts? Sandwich and beverage stops?  There are many possibilities. These 
economic opportunities will only occur if the trail is built.
I’m excited for the possibilities. I strongly encourage our lawmakers to support these 
two bills.
Thank you,
David Robinson
