Completing the Mountain Division Trail (MDT) from Portland to the New Hampshire
border is imperative! There is no way residents of the area as well as visitors would 
not benefit from the completion of the trail. I have used the Fryeburg portion of the 
trail and have always met or passed others recreating on the trail. As an avid cyclist I 
have pedaled the transition from the MDT to Pequawket Trail (Rte 113).  It is like 
pedaling from heaven to hell.  Cycling on Pequawket Trail between Brownfield and 
Baldwin is always daunting and sometimes downright life endangering. I try to avoid 
the experience if possible. If the trail were completed, cyclists would appreciate not 
competing with motor vehicles and drivers would appreciate not having to alter 
driving patterns to accommodate cyclists. 
Completing the MDT would provide miles of inclusive opportunities for active and 
passive recreation for residents and visitors. I implore you to transition the Mountain 
Division rail corridor to a trail and to fund the building of the trail.
Respectfully,
