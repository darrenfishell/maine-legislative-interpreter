LD 1450
My name is Nancy Clift, I live in Steep Falls (Standish), I am writing in support of 
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division 
corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of 
all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham.  I already use and 
enjoy the current Mountain Division trail for bicycling, walking, and skiing.  Access 
to the trail in Steep Falls will provide an area for recreation for myself and others 
away from fast moving traffic on the busy roads near my home.
Thank you,
Nancy Clift
