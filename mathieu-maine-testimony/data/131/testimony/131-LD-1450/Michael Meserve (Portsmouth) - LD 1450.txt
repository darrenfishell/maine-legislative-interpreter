Michael Meserve
Portsmouth
LD 1450
My name is Michael Meserve, and I live in Portsmouth NH. I am a native of Standish,
ME where my whole family resides and I spend a lot of time in the outdoors there. I 
am writing in support of LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use 
for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, 
bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This 
trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already 
exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Michael Meserve
