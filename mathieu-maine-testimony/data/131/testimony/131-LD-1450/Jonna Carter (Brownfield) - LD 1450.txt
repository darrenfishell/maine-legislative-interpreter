LD 1450
My name is Jonna Carter and I live Brownfield. I am writing in support of LD 1450 to
help fund the building of the Mountain Division corridor multi-use recreational trail 
for walkers, runners, bikers, skiers, etc. accessible to people of all ages and abilities. 
I've utilized and enjoyed the Fryeburg portion of the Mountain Division corridor since
it opened many years ago, and I've been waiting eagerly for the continuation and 
extension of this fabulous multi-use trail. 
Thank you,
Jonna Carter
