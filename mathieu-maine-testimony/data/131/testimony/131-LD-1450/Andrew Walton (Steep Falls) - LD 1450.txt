Good afternoon, My name is Andrew Walton, a Steep Falls(Standish) resident. I live down the road from the corridor where it intersects in Steep Falls Village and have always dreamed of what it would be like to ride my bicycle either west or east. My wife, two sons, and I are always looking for trails to go to in the area. We frequently go to both of the Mountain Division trail sections and always enjoy them. I hope to see my dreams come true, not only for my family, but to get folks out here to western Maine where the beauty of the outdoors opens to stunning Sebago Lake views, through Steep Falls Wildlife Management Area, passing Mt. Cutler, and ending with views of the New Hampshire’s mountains. The biggest reason I want to see the trail created is for safe travel between the towns it runs through. I don’t feel safe traveling on foot or bicycle on Route 113 and therefore can’t get far from home without risking my safety. The history of the area started with the success around the railroad and logging industries, the latest chapter has been one of decades of unused potential, lets make the next chapter one that we can be proud of. One that brings people, businesses, and economic advantages to the region. This trail if built will be a gem for our area and state. Please vote Ought to Pass for both LD 404 and LD 1450. Thank you for your time. Andrew Walton
