I have lived in Cornish my whole life and there is no great way for families to to ride 
their bikes safely. The Mountain Division Rail could be a amazing alternative to 
riding on the side of the road with cars with young kids. Maine is also known as the 
vacation state and bringing such a connecting trail from Fryebueg to Portland could 
be amazing for people training for marathons or cycling races. Giving them a safe and
secure spot for these activities. Local schools could utilize the trail for after school 
activities such as running club, cross country, track and field and so forth. There a 
multitude of options this trail brings to the local communities it runs through.
