 have lived in Brownfield, Maine for 37 years and only three miles from the airport 
access to the trail. I hike, bike, walk and xc ski with dogs. When the Rail Trail was 
built from Fryeburg to the airport road, I biked it even before it was completely 
finished. Many people did.  Finally. A safe place to do all those activities.  I pass both
entry points of the trail almost daily and the parking lots almost always have multiple 
vehicles. I see kids on tricycles, the elderly, an even a miniature horse pulling an 
elderly gentleman. So many people use the trail for exercise, socializing, and nature 
walks in a safe environment. And my hope is the the D.O.T. implement the 
recommendation. So many people will be able to use more of the trail.
