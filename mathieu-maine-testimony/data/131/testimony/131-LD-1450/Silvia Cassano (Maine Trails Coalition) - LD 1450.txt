 
Testimony  in Support of LD 1450  
 
 
 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee,  
 My name is Silvia Cassano . I am speaking today on behalf of the M aine Trails Coalition, a state -
wide, all volunteer organization formed in 2019 to champion the establishment, use, and 
stewardship of trails in Maine.  We have supporters all over the state and are part of a growing 
movement dedicated to advancing the trails movement in Maine.  
 
MTC supports LD 1450:  An Act to Fund the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail 
Use Advisory Council. This bill will help to fund the building of the Mountain Division Trail 
from Standish to Fryeburg. The bill proposes using surplus general funds to begin funding the 
trail. 
 The MTC supports  funding of multi- use trail project s on unused rail  corridors that are identified 
in our Maine Active Transportation Arterials  vision  document . This corridor is als o referenced as 
a priority in the newly releas ed, Maine Statewide Active Transportation Plan.  We w ill continue 
to advocate for funding of completing segments of off -road, multi -use trails such as this  because 
we believe in the innumerable  benefits trails such as this offer . 
 
Please reach out to us if you would like to learn more. Thank you all for your time  and for the 
opportunity to comment today.
