LD 1450
I am writing in support of the passage of LD1450. I feel that replacing the rails on the 
Mountain Division line with a pedestrian/bikeway is the most exciting transformation 
of that unused asset. It will be a rewarding addition to our town of Brownfield that 
currently does not have any safe space for bike riding, and will have the added benefit
of being a shot in the arm for our economy. In order to move forward, it is crucial that
funding this work is included. Please do not allow this project to languish for another 
decade. Please vote to approve LD1450. Thank you.
