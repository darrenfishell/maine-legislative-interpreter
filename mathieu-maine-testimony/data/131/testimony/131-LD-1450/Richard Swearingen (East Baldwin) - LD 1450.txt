As someone who has been through a triple heart bypass with complications recently, 
it's important that I stay fit and get regular exercise.
Our road is dangerous and not a place I would walk, especially since I lost part of my 
right foot in the heart attack and recovery experience.
There is no flat, even, ground next to the road even if I wanted to walk there and 
vehicles speed by sometimes pretty recklessly.
It would be very god to have a place to walk, and even bike, that I felt was safe and 
was comfortable.
