My
name
is
Reba
W alton
and
I
live
in
Steep
Falls.
I
am
writing
in
support
of
LD
404
to
allow
the
Mountain
Division
corridor
to
become
a
trail
and
LD
1450
to
help
fund
the
building
of
the
trail.
I
grew
up
in
Standish
and
many
of
my
memories
from
my
childhood
involve
riding
my
bicycle
on
the
Mountain
Division
T rail.
As
a
kid,
we
would
go
for
rides
with
my
sister ,
parents,
and
grandparents.
Now ,
I
am
taking
my
own
children
out
on
the
trail.
My
four
year
old
has
been
riding
a
bike
since
he
was
one,
first
on
a
balance
bike
and
now
on
a
pedal
bike.
W e
look
for
safe
places
to
bring
him
away
from
traf fic
and
the
Mountain
Division
T rail
is
a
perfect
place
for
that.
Once
the
corridor
becomes
a
trail
through
Steep
Falls,
we
will
not
need
to
drive
far
to
get
to
the
trail.
This
is
a
huge
dream
for
our
family
and
we
cannot
wait
for
it
to
be
a
reality .
W e
love
meeting
up
with
friends
and
family
for
trail
walks
and
bike
rides
and
we
look
forward
to
being
able
to
do
this
right
down
the
road
from
us
in
Steep
Falls.
My
husband
and
I
plan
our
vacations
around
visiting
rail
trails
in
other
states
and
we
have
seen
firsthand
how
rail
trails
positively
impact
communities.
I
would
love
for
the
completed
Mountain
Division
T rail
to
be
a
destination
for
trail
lovers
everywhere.
When
the
trail
is
complete,
our
family
will
be
out
there
as
much
as
possible
and
we
know
so
many
people
of
all
ages
and
abilities
who
will
make
use
of
it
as
well.
My
family
and
I
will
be
able
to
safely
ride
our
bikes
from
our
house
to
my
sister ’ s
house
in
Windham
using
the
trail.
It’ s
time
to
turn
the
corridor
into
something
that
will
be
an
incredible
resource
for
our
community!
Thank
you,
Reba
