LD 1450
I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become 
a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. I am hopeful for the 
state-owned Mountain Division corridor to become a wide paved trail for walkers, 
bikers, and runners. This will create opportunities for local tourism and safer exercise 
options compared to using existing roads. Thank you for your support of this project.
