LD 1450
My name is David Newman and my wife and I own The Local Gear, a bicycle and 
outdoor sporting goods shop in Cornish. I am writing in support of LD 404 and LD 
1450.  Almost daily during the season, my customers are asking, “Where can I ride 
that’s safe? What trails are available locally?” And the answer is – there is nothing 
close by. We do not have wide shoulders or bike lanes on our roads and few local 
trails are passable for bicycles.
There is clearly a need in this area for safe, accessible recreation. A finished trail 
connecting the Mountain Division trails in Fryeburg and Windham would be a huge 
asset to our collective communities. It would provide a safe area for recreational 
walkers, families with strollers or children on bikes, wheelchairs, handcycles, and 
recumbent trikes. To have a distance in excess of 20 miles would open the usefulness 
of the trail to people running, walking, or riding for higher levels of fitness.
Please vote in favor of LD 404 and LD 1450.
Thank you for your time.
