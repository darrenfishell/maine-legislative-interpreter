Baldwin - People's Perch
LD 1450
My name is Montana Morris, I live in Baldwin, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. This 
trail will bring ecotourism to the small towns along the tracks to help boost their 
economy. My partner and I own the water tower in Baldwin, across from The Whistle
Stop, and we hope to create a business centered around biking once the trail is 
complete. 113 gets very congested with weekend outdoor tourist traffic. Having spent 
time working with the cycling community in Portland, Scarborough, and Brunswick  
I've found overwhelming support and interest for people who would prefer to travel to
natural spots and small towns by bicycle. Having traveled many miles of roads on 
bicycle throughout Maine I can attest that more bicycle paths are needed for people to
travel safely by bike in rural Maine.
