Iam a resident of Standish who lives very close to the old railroad tracks here in 
Richville. I walk and bike as much as I can. Route 114 is a high speed road that 
terrifies me to walk/bike on. I have driven to Fryeburg and Scarborough etc.. to enjoy 
their trails.
I am all for a trail( no rails) for safe walking and biking. What a wonderful addition it 
would be for residents and tourists alike.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
