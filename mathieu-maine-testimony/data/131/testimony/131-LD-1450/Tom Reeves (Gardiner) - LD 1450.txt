LD 1450
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Tom Reeves and I am a resident of Gardiner.  I am writing to testify in 
support of LD 1450, An Act to Fund the Recommendations of the Mountain Division 
Rail Use Advisory Council.
The Mountain Division Trail will be an active transportation corridor as well as a 
scenic linear park connecting western Maine towns to greater Portland.  It will offer a 
low impact way to travel and provide new opportunities for social and economic 
development.  It will be Maine's first long distance east-west corridor for active 
transportation.  The trail has long been recognized by the Department of 
Transportation as a trail of statewide significance and should be funded as such.
Thank you for supporting this bill.
