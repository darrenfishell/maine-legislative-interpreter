LD 1450
My name is [Insert Your Name], I live in Biddeford and I work for the Eastern Tail. 
People love the ET and expanding trails in Maine makes sense on so many levels. I 
am writing in support of LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use 
for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved or gravel trail for 
walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Patrick Conlon
