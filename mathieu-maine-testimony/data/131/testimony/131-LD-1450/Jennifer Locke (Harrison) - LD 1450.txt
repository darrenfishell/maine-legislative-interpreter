LD 1450
I am writing in support of LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail.  the best use 
for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, 
bikers and runners this will make in accessible to people of all ages and abilities.  
Families and individuals will be able to safely explore the landscape of the state of 
Maine without the dangers of traffic.  This trail extension will connect the 9 miles of 
Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg, Gorham and Windham.  I 
know that my family and friends would use this trail for recreation and exercise.  
Maine roads can be narrow, and drivers can get frustrated when they have to avoid 
bikes or runners.  Here is a safe alternative.
