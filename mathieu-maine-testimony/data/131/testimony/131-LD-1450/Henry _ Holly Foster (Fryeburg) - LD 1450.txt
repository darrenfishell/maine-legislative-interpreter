LD 1450
We, Henry and Holly Foster of Fryeburg, ME, support LD1450 bill to support the 
funding of the Mountain Division Trail from Standish to Fryeburg. We have 
witnessed the use of the Fryeburg Trail by many people.  It will only enhance the 
outdoor experience by connecting the towns in between to make a larger trail from 
Windham to Fryeburg and hopefully into New Hampshire one day.  It will also 
benefit all towns economically including Fryeburg.
