LD 1450
Good afternoon,
I am writing in SUPPORT of LD 1450, funding for the Mountain Division Rail Use 
Advisory Council's majority recommendation, Trail Until Rail (Option II). My name 
is Bob Green, a 47-year resident living in Gorham and (currently) Standish, and a 
general dentist (now retired) practicing for 39 years in Windham. I moved my family 
to Maine from urban America because (among many reasons) of its wholesome 
outdoors appeal. As an avid cyclist I frequently use the MDT between routes 202 and 
35 for biking, running, walking, and in the winter xc skiing, coexisting with 
snowmobiles (who unintentionally groom the trail for the skiers). 
I just returned from a camping/biking trip to Quebec. I camped (among other places) 
at the North Beach Campground on Lake Champlain and the Burlington Vermont 
Greenway Trail and In Magog, Quebec at a site on the La Montagnarde, Verte 1 
multiuse/bike trail (Quebec is replete with recreational trails). I am always amazed at 
the popularity of these trails and the pride citizens take in them
Why not in our backyard?  And if not now, when?
Respectfully,
Bob Green
