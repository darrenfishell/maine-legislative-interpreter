LD 1450
My name is Britton Wolfe, I live in Hiram. I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the nine miles of 
Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and 
Windham. 
Thank you,
Britton Wolfe
