LD 1450
My name is Eileen Webb and I live in Buxton, ME.
I'm writing to support LD 1450 to fund the building of the Mountain Division corridor
trail. I love the idea of extending the trail from Windham through to Fryeburg, and I 
can't think of a better use for my tax dollars than expanding outdoor access. A paved 
trail will give a huge variety of people better access to this beautiful area throughout 
the year.
Thank you!
