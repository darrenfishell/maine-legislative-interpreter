I am a senior citizen and live alone. Walking the Mountain Division Trails is one of 
my daily exercises. I walk these trails because they are safe, well maintained and 
provide me with not only great exercise but also give me the opportunity to meet and 
interact with others. I also walk with my grandchildren and great grandchildren for a 
healthy and fun way to enjoy their company.
