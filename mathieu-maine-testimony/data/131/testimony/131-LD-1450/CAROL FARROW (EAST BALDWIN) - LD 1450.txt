CAROL FARROW
EAST BALDWIN
LD 1450
I am a resident of the Town of Baldwin and would like to make my wishes known in 
favor of LD 1450, to Fund the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use 
Advisory Council. I have used the Fryburg portion of the Mountain Division Trail, 
and am looking forward to enjoying the Steep Falls and Baldwin portion as well.
