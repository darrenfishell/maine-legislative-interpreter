Windham
LD 1450
Hello, my name is Mallary Walton I am writing in support of 404 to allow the 
Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building 
of the trail. My family lives in Windham just minutes from the Gambo Trail start. We 
use the Mountain Division Trail regularly as a family. We really enjoy the trail as it is
close and convenient for us, but also because of the paved path to walk with the 
stroller or bike. Connecting the trail to go through all the towns would be wonderful 
for all outdoor enthusiasts no matter the season. 
Thank you,
Mallary Walton
