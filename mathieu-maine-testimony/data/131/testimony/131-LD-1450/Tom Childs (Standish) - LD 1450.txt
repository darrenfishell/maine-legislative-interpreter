Tom Childs
Standish
LD 1450
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and esteemed colleagues of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation: My name is Tom Childs, I live in Standish, 
Maine, I am writing in support of LD 404 & LD 1450. The best use for the Mountain 
Division Line is a trail until rail as recommended by the Rail Use Advisory Council. 
I suffer from the debilitating disease, ALS (AKA Lou Gehrig's disease), and the 
Mountain Division Trail network is a window of brightness to my otherwise 
miserable existence. I am confined to a wheelchair 16 hours a day, and the PAIVED 
trails afford me the ability to get outside, breath the fresh air, and enjoy the Flora and 
Fawna Maine is known for!
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.
Thank you, Tom Childs
