I use the mountain division trail often. It is widely used fir runners, bikers. Walkers 
horse riders, and dog walkers. Many families use the trails also. Its a wonderful 
community area. Please continue to fund this gem of outside activity . Extending it 
would bring more communities together. I understand funding is always an issues.  
Maybe offer a parking pass for a year of say $5 or $10 DONATION kinda like a 
MDT club membership.  To help fund the MDT.?
