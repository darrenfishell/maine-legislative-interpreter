Karen & Perry Glidden
Standish
LD 1450
My husband, Perry and I (Karen) Glidden, live on the Old Standish Road, Standish, 
Maine. We are frequent users of all the local trail networks in our area and are writing
to give our support for LD1450 to help fund the extension and building of the 
Mountain Division corridor from Standish to Fryeburg. We hope you will seriously 
consider this and see the great opportunities it will offer for people of all ages and 
abilities. Thank you!
