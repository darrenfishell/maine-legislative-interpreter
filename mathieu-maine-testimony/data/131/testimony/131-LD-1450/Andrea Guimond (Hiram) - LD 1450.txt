LD 1450
My name is Andrea Guimond.  I live in Hiram, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities.  I believe it is especially important for our communities in 
rural Maine to have a safe place to exercise.  Especially with more and more children 
and elderly feeling isolated, this is a way to connect and improve lifestyle habits 
young, the elders, and everyone in between.  This is also an opportunity to develop 
new business and improve lives on multiple levels.
Thank you,
Andrea Guimond
