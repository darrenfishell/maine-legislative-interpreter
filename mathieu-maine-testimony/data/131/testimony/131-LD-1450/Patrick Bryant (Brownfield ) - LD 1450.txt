LD 1450
My name is Patrick Bryant, I live in Brownfield , I am writing in support of LD 404 
to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund 
the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor 
is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to 
people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of 
Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and 
Windham
