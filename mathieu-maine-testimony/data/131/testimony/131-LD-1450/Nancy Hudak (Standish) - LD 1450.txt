As a resident of Standish, I support funding the Mountain Division [Rail] Trail should
LD 404 pass.
Having read the Advisory Committee's Report, it is clear that they have taken into 
account the various problems inherent in the Trail's development. The Trail as 
ultimately proposed is not particularly expensive and is a good use of taxpayer dollars
to benefit citizens of the surrounding communities.
