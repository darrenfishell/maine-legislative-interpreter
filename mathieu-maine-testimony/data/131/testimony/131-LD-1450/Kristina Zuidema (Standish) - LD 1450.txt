Standish
LD 1450
My name is Kristina Zuidema. I live in the town of Standish. I am writing in support 
of LD 404 Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD1450 to help fund 
building the trail. My husband and I often bike the trail from Standish to Windham 
and the trail in Fryeburg. 
Extending these trails would give the neighboring communities more access to being 
outdoors and exercising. 
This is an investment in the communities and for generations to come. I love seeing 
people biking, walking, and running on these trails. 
It is much safer for people to be on the trails instead of the roads with car and truck 
traffic. 
Please support both LD404 and LD1450.
Thank you.
