Patricia  Jackson 
Narberth 
LD 1450
My name is Pat Jackson and I live in Narberth, Pennsylvania. I am writing in support 
of LD 1450 to help fund the building of the Mountain Division corridor trail. The best
use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, 
bikers and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This 
Trail extension will connect to the nine miles of mountain division rail trail that 
already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. You may wonder why I care
about this. I have family who live in Brownfield and I visit them often. When I do, 
out comes my bike and I ride this Trail often, a tonic for me as well as remotely for 
the many who enjoy the photos I post on Facebook. Please make this happen.
