My name is Pranaya.  I live in Maine and I own the Whistle Stop General store in 
East Baldwin.  The site of the store was historically a linoleum mill, a manufacturing 
site for airboats, lawnmowers, and trainstop where lumber was loaded and refueling 
occurred.  Our business thrives on thru traffic and with the transformation to a trail, 
we would anticipate that thousands of travelers would be interested in making short 
and long trips on the trail.  Trails bring business.  More so, we often struggle to find 
employees and good employees are often attracted to living in areas where 
recreational trails exist;  which would be a benefit in finding reliable help.  We would 
love to see a trail become a reality behind our store and provide a comfortable 
location where tourists and locals can stop on their trip to buy lunch, rest at our picnic
tables, refill their water or look at a map that would show what lies ahead on their 
voyage.  I see the great economic benefit that a trail will bring to the area and the 
social and health benefits which would come along with it.  I support the state funding
required to move the Mountain Division Trail forward. We will provide a memorable 
experience and a place to refuel for those who stop by the Whistle Stop.
