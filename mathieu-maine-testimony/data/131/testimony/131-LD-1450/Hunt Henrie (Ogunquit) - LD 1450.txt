Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Hunt Henrie and I am a resident of Ogunquit. I am writing to testify in 
strong support all the bills being heard today. I am in support of LD 209, which would
allow the Department of Transportation to permit an interim bicycle and pedestrian 
trail on 26.5 miles of the inactive Berlin Subdivision Rail Corridor, while preserving 
the corridor for future rail. 
I am also in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a 
trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building of the Mountain Division trail.
Having these rail trails through and near my community would be an incredible 
resource for me, my family, and my community. I believe the best use for these 
state-owned corridors is a trail and I support funding for trail systems such as these. 
Connected trails such as these will connect people to each other and to our natural 
places, providing a car-free alternative to get active outdoors and to get where we 
need to go.
Although these trails are not next to my home in Ogunquit, I currently drive as long as
necessary to access existing trails in Maine for running, cycling and walking.  I also 
use the trails to travel between towns as this avoids using my car and allows me to 
exercise.  In particular, the Berlin Corridor trail would allow me to ride to Portland 
and then connect further to Auburn.
Thank you,
Hunt Henrie
