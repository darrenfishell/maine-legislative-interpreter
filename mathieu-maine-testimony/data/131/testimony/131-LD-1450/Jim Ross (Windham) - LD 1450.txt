Jim Ross
Windham
LD 1450
Hello,
My name is Jim Ross, I live in Windham, and I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham. 
I have been a regular user of the existing section from Windham to Standish for many
years. As a cyclist, it's  great to be able to ride and not have to be concerned about 
distracted drivers. The only problem is that if I want to ride further I need to go back 
on the (much less safe) roads. I would love to be able to ride all day safely, and in a 
quiet, natural environment.
I think a lot of people probably think as I do, and a trail that extended from 
Westbrook to Fryeburg would be a real draw, bringing tourists to the area. There just 
aren't many similar length off-road paved trails anywhere. It would really put Maine 
on the map in the cycling world.
Thanks for your consideration.
