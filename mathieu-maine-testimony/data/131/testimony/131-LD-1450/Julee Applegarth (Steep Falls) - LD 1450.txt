Steep Falls
LD 1450
My name is Julee Applegarth, I live in Steep Falls, I am writing in support of LD 404 
to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham. 
Steep Falls developed a “Village Plan”, part of the last Standish Comprehension Plan.
In this plan, it is recognized and stated to encourage the use of and developed of trails 
in our area.  The Mountain Division rail-trail helps to meet this goal.  And envision 
bringing economic development and enrichment to our village.
I personally will use this trail every season, especially since it links into other natural 
resource  trails.  I am very excited to use I for cross country skiing.
Thank you,
Julee Applegarth
