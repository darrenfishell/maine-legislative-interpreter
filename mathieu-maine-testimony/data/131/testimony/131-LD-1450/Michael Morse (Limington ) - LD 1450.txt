LD 1450
My name is Michael Morse, I live in Charlestown, MA but I am originally from 
Limington, ME, where both my parents and other family and friends still currently 
live today. I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor
to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use for 
the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, 
and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail 
extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists
in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. I believe this is the best and healthiest use 
of this land and provides a safe and picturesque environment for people to exercise 
and enjoy the outdoors.
Thank you,
Michael Morse
