LD 1450
My Name is Terry McClare , I live in Brownfield, ME. Im writing in support of LD 
1450 to help fund the building of the trail. the best use of the state owned mouton 
division corridor is a wide paved trail for walking ,biking,running. which will be 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities . this rail trail extension will connect to 
the 9 miles of mountain division rail trail that already exists in Fryeburg and 
Gorham,and Windham. Thank you Terry McClare
