Testimony of Meghan Russo 
Maine Department of Transportation 
Before the 131$‘ Legislature, Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
In Opposition to LD 1450 
An Act to Fund the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, I am Meghan Russo, Manager of Legislative and Constituent Services for 
MaineDOT. MaineDOT respectfully opposes LD 1450. 
As drafted this bill does not require any action of MaineDOT. It is, however, premature. The 
recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council have not been 
implemented. A Resolve, LD 404, has been submitted by MaineDOT to implement the 
recormnendations of the Rail Use Advisory Council and remove 31 miles of state-owned inactive 
railroad track between the towns of Standish and Fryeburg and replace it with an interim 
bike/ped trail. This process is subject to available funding resources, permitting and municipal 
agreements. Until that Resolve is ﬁnally passed, identifying and allocating funding for the 
project is premature. 
Funding options for the trail completion would need to be discussed among all interested parties. 
Any state funding contributions would be identiﬁed through our Three-Year Work Plan process. 
Estimated completion cost of the proposed trail, in 2021, was $20.1 million. Completion of the 
project would only occur once appropriate funding was identiﬁed and secured and is likely to 
span multiple years. 
It is worth noting that an alternate route for approximately 3-miles of the corridor along the 
Portland Water District (PWD) property has not been identiﬁed. An off-road trail on a new 
aligmnent could likely add several million dollars to the total project estimate. Additional 
feasibility and engineering should be competed on all 31-miles of the proposed trail to identify 
the full range of potential design and construction costs. 
Thank you.
