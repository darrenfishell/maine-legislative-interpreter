RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to create Consistent 
Election Dates for Citizen-initiated Referenda in Even Numbered Election Years
 Testimonial of ANGELA J. TYVOLL, OF Garland, Maine
The constitution as written by our wise forefathers should not be changed. It would be a direct
slur debasing the intelligence and name of our ancestors and creators of the constitution.
The way this Act was written is confusing and leads to misinterpretation, truly diabolical work, 
just like Ranked Choice Voting. I could name multiple acts in the same category with the 
same gobbledygook instead of plain language as in the Constitution of the United States 
which is the best in the world.
