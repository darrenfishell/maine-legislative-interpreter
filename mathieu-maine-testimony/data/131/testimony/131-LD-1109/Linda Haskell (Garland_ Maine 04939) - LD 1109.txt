RESOLUTION, Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Create Consistent 
Election Dates for Citizen-initiated Referenda in Even Numbered Election Years
After being at the Public Hearing, I have decided that this is possibly a good idea. 
I do not like the idea of changes to the Maine Constitution. I see the results of the Ranked 
Choice Voting being shoved down our throat with the deception in the Article when it was 
introduced. It has given the Maine voters a false majority,so I am skeptical of any legislation 
presently being brought forward. 
This is my testimony, Linda P. Haskell Garland, Maine
