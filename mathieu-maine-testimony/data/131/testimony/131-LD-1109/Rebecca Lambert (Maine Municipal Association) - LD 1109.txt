 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
In Opposition to  
 
LD 1109, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Create 
Consistent Election Dates for Citizen- initiated Referenda in Even -numbered Election Years  
 
March 27, 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1109 
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Maine is one of 23 states and on e territory that support citizen- led referenda and has a 
strong history supporting participatory democracy. While the intent to streamline elections is a 
measure the LPC fully encourages and supports, municipal officials share concern for changing the cons titution to codify a timeline  for which citizen -led initiatives can be moved forward . 
Citizen -led initiatives have been around in Maine since 1908 and provide an avenue for 
residents to bring issues of importance to the legislature utilizing a specific set of guidelines. This 
importance piece of direct democracy that Mainers enjoy provides the needed checks and 
balances to our democratic system. By limiting access to this method of participation, it 
undermines that system and only serves to make it more difficult for citizens to get a measure 
onto the ballot and to make our state less democratic.  
The LPC urges this committee to trust the people of Maine and consider voting  ought not 
to pass on  LD 1 109. Thank you for  your time and for considering the munic ipal perspective on 
this issue.
