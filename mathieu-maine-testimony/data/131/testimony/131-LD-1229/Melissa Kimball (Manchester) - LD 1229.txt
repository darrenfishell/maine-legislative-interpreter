4/20/23 Talking Points 
 
1.  Share (at your comfort) why you do peer work, your experience with an open adjudicated case 
with DCYF (Division for Children Youth and Families ) and a missing area early on was peer 
support, someone who could iden*fy with what you we re going through. 
Strength to Succeed started in 2018 as a grant fund ed ini*a*ve suppor*ng parents with open court cases  
who were involved due to Substance Use with childre n 10 or younger.  The program expanded SUD in 
2019 to support assessment cases and Rela*ve Caregi vers involved for SUD with children 10 or younger.  
In 2020 the program expanded again to delivering pe er support to families involved with the division d ue 
to Mental Health and Chronic Neglect.  And in Octob er 2021, STS became embedded in the DCYF service 
array as a Medicaid approved service for Parents, K in involved at any level due to SUD, MH, CN with no  
restric*on on the age limit of the children. 
Our staﬀ are all individuals with lived experience (or exper*se as we call it) and that experience can  be 
with child protec*on, legal systems, addic*on/recov ery, mental health.  This is what gives us space to  
connect with families on a diﬀerent level than the CPSW.
