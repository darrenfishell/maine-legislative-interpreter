Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services.  
 
My name is Leslie Clark. I am a person in long-term recovery and serve as the Executive 
Director of Portland Recovery Community Center (PRCC.) I am writing to you today in favor of 
LD 1229: An Act to Support Peer Mentors for Parents Involved in the Child Protective Services 
System. 
 
Many parents involved with child protective services (CPS) in the state of Maine are affected by 
SUD and need support in finding and sustaining recovery. “Substance use continues to be a 
significant factor in the lives of many families involved with child welfare. In calendar year 
2020… substance use was a risk factor in 50% of removals by OCFS.”1 Additionally, “the 
impact of substance use, and, in particular, the opioid epidemic has significantly affected 
children and families. Beyond removal, when substance use is a factor in a case it takes, on 
average, an additional three months for children to reunify with their parents when compared to 
those cases that do not involve substance use.”2 
 
As a recovery community organization supporting thousands of people in recovery throughout 
the state of Maine through peer based support groups, recovery coaching, and prosocial 
activities, we know first-hand the powerfully positive impact of peers support. Many of the 
people who come to our centers are parents and are working hard to break the cycle of addiction 
and its impact on their families. Peer Recovery Coaches support multiple pathways to recovery 
and assist people in finding and sustaining long term recovery – something that takes time and 
support to achieve.  Ultimately, peer recovery coaches can assist CPS involved parents with 
strengthening their personal recoveries to be in a better position to provide a safe environment 
for their children.

The benefits of Peer Recovery Support Services have been established. “Peers understand 
substance use disorders and the recovery process because of their own life experience and can 
assist with engaging the parent in services to improve treatment and child welfare outcomes. 
Parents are often more comfortable confiding candidly with a peer because of their shared life 
experiences. Peers can reduce negative attitudes and stigma among agencies and community 
partners toward parents with substance use disorders.”3 Utilizing peer services has shown to 
improve outcomes for individuals in treatment for SUD, reducing substance use,4 leading to 
better medical adherence,5 reducing inpatient readmission6 and reducing criminal behavior.7  
 
Furthermore, a brief presented by the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare 
states that, “These… programs have demonstrated positive outcomes for participating families, 
such as improved treatment completion and recovery rates for parents, less time children spent in 
out-of-home care, and improved family reunification rates.”8 This bill will increase access for 
this type of resource in every county in Maine.  
 
All people affected with SUD should have support in accessing recovery. This is especially 
important when CPS is involved and family reunification is at stake. Investing in peer recovery 
coach access for CPS involved parents in an investment in the future health of Maine families 
and their communities. On behalf of PRCC, I urge you to vote in favor of LD 1229. 
 
Sincerely,
