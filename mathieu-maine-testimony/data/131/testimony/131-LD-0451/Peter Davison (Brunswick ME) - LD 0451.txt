LD 451
I am writing to request that you support LD 451 - An Act to Ensure Transparent and 
Accountable Temporary Nurse Agencies.
As a nursing facility administrator, I struggle to continue maintain my own staffing. I am 
contacted at least three times a week by staff relief agencies that are looking to place people 
in my environment. Many of these agencies are not based in the State of Maine and their 
rates are absolutely insane. This bill would be a first step in leveling the playing field between 
providers and agencies. 
As a nursing facility we are required to maintain so much information on our staff and 
temporary staffing agencies should have to share in that burden. The exponential cost of 
temporary/interim staff will soon create a fiscal burden that many facilities may not be able to 
contend with and survive. 
I urge you to pass this bill.
Thank you for your hard work and for reading my message.
