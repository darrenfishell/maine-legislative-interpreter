LD 451
I am writing to request that you support LD 451 - An Act to Ensure Transparent and 
Accountable Temporary Nurse Agencies.
As an Administrator for a Long-Term Care Facility, I cannot stress to you how 
important it is to the industry to find some way to regulate what these agencies are 
charging facilities. I honestly feel if these rates continue it will have grave 
consequences to every long-term care facility in the state.
As a facility we cannot compete with what the agencies are paying their staff. Do you 
realize we are paying $52.00 an hour for a Certified Nursing Assistant?  How can a 
facility possible sustain itself with those rates? Unlike house staff, agency staff have 
no vested interest in providing a caring environment to residents.
