LD 451
I am writing to request that you support LD 451 - An Act to Ensure Transparent and 
Accountable Temporary Nurse Agencies.
We are currently spending $35,000 every two-week pay period for contract 
employees at prices generally 2-3 times the cost of regular employees. Some of these 
contracted employees are from Maine, but now that we have several out-of-state 
agencies involved, some of them are on 13-week contracts and come from outside 
Maine.
