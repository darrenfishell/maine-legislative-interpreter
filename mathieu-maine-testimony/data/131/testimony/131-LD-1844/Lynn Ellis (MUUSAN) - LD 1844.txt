Testimony in support of LD 1844 -- An Act to Support Emergency Facility Construction, Renovation and 
Acquisition by Creating a Matching Grant Program  
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere and Members of the Housing Committee 
 
My name is Lynn Ellis and I live in Brunswick. I submit this testimony on behalf of the Maine Unitarian 
Universalist State Advocacy Network (MUUSAN) which connects the 26 UU congregations of Maine in 
social justice and faith advocacy. Our guiding principles include affirming the inherent worth and dignity 
of every person and seeks justice, equity and compassion in human relations.  
 
The community of Brunswick and surrounding towns is served by Tedford Housing. In recent years, the 
housing crisis and lack of affordable housing increases the need for emergency shelter. The need is far 
greater than what is available in beds. More capacity is desperately needed. A 64-bed facility is 
underway and money has been raised. However, the new building is costing far more than was initially 
expected. LD 1844 could substantially assist in completing this facility and provide additional shelter 
beds that will help assist more people.  
 
MUUSAN urges the members of this Committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 1844, 
 
Lynn Ellis, HealthCare chair 
MUUSAN
