Construction and Renovation Statewide by Creating a Matching Grant Program  
 
May 1 2, 2023  
 
 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and honorable members of the Joint Select Committee on 
Housing , my name is Nicole Evans and I am the Executive Director of United Way of Mid Coast 
Maine. On behalf of our organization, I’d like to express our support fo r LD 1844 . 
 
Every community in Maine is facing a housing crisis. Today, h ard-working individuals and families 
do not have enough income to afford housing  and are being forced to live in their cars, tents, and 
couch surf. These unsustainable option s lea ve many with no other option than to use homeless 
services . Homeless shelters are at capacity  with no end in sight.  
 
LD 1844 addresses a critical need  every community is facing . 
 
People in every community are doing their best to address each aspect of the housing crisis ; 
however, w e cannot avoid the reality that man y of us, our family members, friends, and neighbors 
are housing ins ecure and are at risk of be coming homeless . We need your support of LD 1844 —
expansion of emergency housing has to be included in solving our housing crisis . 
 
Please vote ou ght to pass on LD 1844.  
 
Thank you for all that you do . We are grateful for your service.
