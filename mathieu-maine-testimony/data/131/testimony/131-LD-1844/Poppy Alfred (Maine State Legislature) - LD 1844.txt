Testimony of Rep. Poppy Arford presenting 
LD 1844, An Act to Support Emergency Housing Facility Construction, Renovation and 
Acquisition Statewide by Creating a Matching Grant Program 
Before the Joint Select Committee on Housing' 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and respected colleagues of the Housing Committee, I am 
Poppy Arford, Representative of District 101 in Brunswick. Thank you for the opportunity to_ 
present LD 1844, An Act to Support Emergency Housing Facility Construction, Renovation 
and Acquisition Statewide by Creating a Matching -Grant Program. I will be speaking to my 
proposed amendment, which was provided to you in advance of this hearing and is also attached 
to my testimony. 
Emergency housing or shelters are the “emergency room” of our statewide housing system. As 
hospital emergency rooms are central to stabilizing those facing signiﬁcant medical distress, 24- 
hour shelters play a similar role for those experiencing homelessness. Providing for a statewide 
emergency shelter network with adequate capacity is critical to starting our homeless Mainers 
on a path to safe and stable housing. 
To address this need, LD 1844 establishes an emergency housing matching grant program. The 
program will be managed by the Maine State Housing Authorityand, through an .ElI11'1l.l ﬂl RFP 
process, provide funding for new construction, renovation, and acquisition of existing buildings 
for the purpose of providing critically needed emergency housing -for people experiencing 
homelessness. 
The Housing -and Urban Development (HUD) 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report tells 
us that last year, on one night in January, a total of 4,411 Mainers were homeless, an increase of 
110% from the 2020 number of 2,097 Maine people. This includes individuals, families, and 
unaccompanied minors experiencing homelessness. Of those 4,411 people experiencing 
homelessness, 164 were sleeping unsheltered in the height of winter, on what must have beena 
very cold night.
I will share two stories that speak to the problem. On another cold night in late November of 
2019, 64-year-old Russell Williams, a Brunswick resident experiencing homelessness, was 
found dead lying beside the railroad tracks in his sleeping bag. Fast forward to this year, ona 
rainy, chilly night last week, when an older woman, who I will call Mary, noticed my legislative 
license plates at a Brunswick gas station and approached me to express her gratitude for my 
service. Aﬁer I thanked her for the kind words, Mary went on to share her personal story of 
being unexpectedly homeless in Brunswick with no stable housing in sight. 
In sharing Russell and Mary’s stories, the painful sense of loss and regret I felt when I ﬁrst 
learned of Russell’s death, and again when I met Mary, is again with me. I believe that, toa 
greater or lesser degree, all of us feel pain when we hear the stories of people experiencing 
homelessness and imagine what it must be like to live the stories. We are faced with the reality 
that our statewide emergency housing network is woefully inadequate. It was not able to provide 
critically needed emergency housing to Russell or Mary — and hundreds more who ﬁnd 
themselves along the continuum of being unexpectedly to chronically homeless statewide. I 
appreciate that many ‘organizations, private and public, are working very hard to respond, as 
with the_Maine Housing grant funds totaling $16.3 million for shelter and housing supports, 
which were awarded in March of this year. Yet, in truth, it is simply not enough ~ much more is 
needed. 
I am offering LD 1844, which provides $5 million in funding for an Emergency Housing 
Matching Grant Program, to respond to this need. The program would award grants of up to 
$500,000 per recipient and require a one-to-one match from another funding source. Recipients 
would need to provide 24/7 emergency housing and housing navigation services within the 
facility built or acquired using the grant funding. I am offering a matching grant program, to 
support Maine communities in stepping up to address the need for emergency housing statewide. 
I understand that this bill is but one of many submitted this session to meet the spectrum of 
affordable housing needs Maine people are experiencing, from access to emergency shelters and 
housing navigation services, to housing ﬁrst programs, permanent supportive housing, rental 
assistance, and subsidized home ownership — the goal being for every Maine resident to have an 
affordable, safe, pennanent home. LD 1844 works in sync with LD 2 and other proposals 
addressing our statewide housing crisis. Together, if passed and funded, these bills will be the 
”enough” that is needed to move through the housing crisis to a place Where housing for all is 
becoming a reality in Maine. 
Thank you for the time and attention you are giving to LD 1844 and all the excellent housing 
bills put forward this session. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me.
