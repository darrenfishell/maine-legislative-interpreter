Beer & Weed Magazine

Thanks to everyone on the Judiciary Committee for your consideration of my 
comments and your service to the state and its people:
Obviously, our magazine, "Beer & Weed," is meant to be fun and lighthearted, but it 
has a serious side, too, bringing to light how normal the users of beer and cannabis 
are, side by side. These are regular Mainers, enjoying a craft experience that enhances
their lifestyle. 
Now that cannabis is fully legal, enjoyed by Mainers of all ages and occupations, and 
people are making millions off of it, it's unethical and simply unfair to force people to
carry around criminal records due to cannabis offenses. 
Our cover this month has a mother with two children on it, living in a beautiful 
suburban home in Cumberland. She owns a cannabis company. 20 years ago, she 
would have been a felon for doing what pays her substantial rent right now. 
It's simply not right to force people — many of whom were regular law-abiding 
citizens in every way other than their cannabis use — to carry around the burden of a 
criminal record. 
While I am commenting on this single bill, please know that I and may many readers 
support any bill that would expunge the records of cannabis users (or any non-violent 
offender after a certain number of years, as others have suggested).
