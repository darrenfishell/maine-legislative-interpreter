RE: LD 1646 “An Act to Vacate or Adjust Sentences and Expunge Arrests, 
Convictions and Adjudications for Cannabis-related Offenses. ” 
Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary: 
MACDL supports LD I646. 
Maine legalized medical marijuana use in 1999 and recreational marijuana use in 2016. 
Maine has an Office of Cannabis Policy that develops and enforces administrative rules 
for the medical and recreational use of marijuana. Notwithstanding this legalization, 
Maine spent years prosecuting criminal and civil violations for mere possession of 
marijuana when popular opinion overwhelming did not view marijuana use and 
possession as a crime. Maine likewise still has laws that criminalize the “cultivation of 
marijuana ” when a person possesses more than 3 mature marijuana plants. 17-A M.R.S.§ 
1117 & 28-B M.R.S. § 1502(1). 
Far too many Mainers have criminal records for possession of marijuana prior to its 
legalization. Some Mainers, moreover, are still facing prosecution and possibly serving 
time behind bars for “cultivation ” of marijuana. LD 1646 seeks to vacate all criminal and 
civil violations based on possession and then further seeks to reduce the sentences for 
anyone serving time for any other “cannabis-related ” offense. This is a common-sense bill 
that recognizes the unnecessary harm inﬂicted from years of senseless marijuana 
prosecutions and seeks to expunge those convictions in the most minor of cases (i.e., 
criminal and civil possessions) while reducing the impact of jail time on any additional 
marijuana convictions. 
Sincerely, 
/03/c/ Matthew D. Morgan, Esq. 
MACDL Vice President
