Amy McFarland
Maine Cannabis Union
LD 1646
Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee.
My name is Amy McFarland. I am a patient, a medical cannabis farmer and the 
President of Maine Cannabis Union.
The Maine Cannabis Union is in favor of LD#1646, "An Act to Vacate or Adjust 
Sentences and Expunge Arrests, Convictions and Adjudications for Cannabis-related 
Offenses".
If passed, this bill would provide that all arrests, convictions and adjudications for 
crimes or civil violations for possession of cannabis are vacated and requires the 
records of those arrests, convictions and adjudications to be expunged in accordance 
with a process established in the bill. This bill also allows for an individual who has 
been convicted of a cannabis-related offense and who is still serving a sentence, 
including incarceration or supervised release, probation or administrative release, for 
that crime to petition the original sentencing court to resentence that individual. 
In addition, this bill would require all costs to be paid for by the Adult Use Cannabis 
Public Health and Safety program along with the Municipal Opt-in Fund . 
Having the Adult Use program and the Opt-In Fund pay for these fees is a respectful 
thing to do in our opinion. If passed, this bill will help many Mainers.
With that said, I ask you all to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD# 1646

President, Maine Cannabis Union
