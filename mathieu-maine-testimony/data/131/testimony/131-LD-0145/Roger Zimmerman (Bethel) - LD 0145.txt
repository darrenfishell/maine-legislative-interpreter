I am in favor of this bill, with the exception that license revocation should occur following the 
second offense.  Distracted driving is dangerous, clearly matching descriptions for impaired 
driving, e.g. under the influence.
The argument about "poor Mainers" losing work time is a non-argument.  The driver is aware 
that what they are doing is dangerous, and threatening to other drivers.  Also, while such 
driver may lack a high level of disposable income, they obviously can afford the distracting 
electronic device.
