Testimony of Lt. Bruce Scott 
NEITHER F011 NOR AGAINST LD 145 
An Act to Increase the Penalties for Operation of a Motor Vehicle 
- 
While Using a Handheld Electronic Device or Mobile Telephone 
Senator Chipman, Rep. Williams, and distinguished Members of the 
Ioint Standing Committee on Transportation, my name is Lt. Bruce 
Scott, and I am the Commanding Officer of the State Police Traffic 
Safety Unit. I am here today to testify on behalf of the Department of 
Public Safety and the Maine State Police in Neither For Nor Against LD 
145. p 
This bill aims to increase the ﬁnes for using a handheld device or 
mobile telephone While operating a motor vehicle from $50.00 to 
$500.00 for a ﬁrst offense and from $250.00 to $1,000 for second 
offense. It further increases the penalty on a third offense by addinga 
license revocation._ 
V\/hen LD 165, the “hands free bill,” was signed into law in 2019, it 
created the prohibition of operating a motor vehicle while usinga 
handheld device or mobile telephone. The original ﬁne was

inadvertently set at“ not less than” $50.00 by the Committee which 
allowed the Chief Iudge to set the ﬁne at any rate above that. The fee 
was set by the Vi01ation ’ s Bureau at $185.00 at that time. Sen. 
Diamond’s intent was to set the original ﬁne at“ not more than” $50.00. 
As a result of that action, Sen. Diamond asked that the Violation ’s 
Bureau reduce the ﬁne back down to $50.00 while he drafted a new bill 
for the following session to ﬁx this error. Sen. Diamond submitted a 
subsequent bill, that became law in 2020, setting the ﬁne at not more 
than $50.00, which brings us to the current ﬁne amount. 
I believe by causing a dramatic increase in the ﬁne, without there 
being enough time to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the new 
law and ﬁne amount, would not be prudent. We know from experience 
that higher ﬁnes and penalties don't necessarily lead to higher 
compliance. At times we have seen the opposite effect, due largely to 
the compassion of police ofﬁcers that don’t feel the punishment ﬁts 
the crime. Some ofﬁcers will opt to issue a warning rather than to levy 
a harsh penalty that includes disproportionate ﬁnes or license 
revocations. Also, due to the pandemic and a reduction in enforcement 
efforts it is difﬁcult to determine if the law has had a real chance to 
create the desired effect. However, a study conducted in 2021 by the 
Preusser Research Group Inc., indicates that there was a reduction in 
overall violators from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.8% in 2021. 
For these reasons, we are Neither For Nor Against LD 145. 
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State 
Police, I thank you for your time and would be happy to try and 
answer any questions that you might have.
