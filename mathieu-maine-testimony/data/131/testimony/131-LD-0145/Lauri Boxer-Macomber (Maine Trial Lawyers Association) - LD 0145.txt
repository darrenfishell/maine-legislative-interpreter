 TESTIMONY OF ATTORNEY LAURI BOXER -MACOMBER  
On Behalf of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association  
 
LD 145 – Ought to Pass

Joint Standing Committee on Transportation

 Good afternoon, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Member s of the 
Committee on Transportation:  
 
My name is Lauri Boxer -Macomber. I am a resident of Portland, Maine and an attorney 
who represents victims of distracted driving and other traffic trauma cases throughout the State 
of Maine.  I offer this testimony in support of LD 145 individually  and on behalf of the 
MTLA.  
 
 Like many of you, MTLA attorneys are no strangers to the myriad consequences of 
distracted driving. Not only are we aware of the frightening dis tracted driving data from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1 and National Highway Transportation 
Safety Administration (NHTSA), 2 but many of us have direct experience working with 
Mainers whose bodies and lives have been crushed, maimed, and destroyed because of 
distracted drivers. We have watched previously healthy, competen t, and hard -working 
individuals struggle with traumatic brain injuries, loss of limb s, permanent impairment, 
permanent disfigurement, loss of organs and and other harms followin g distracted driving 
collisions.  We have also seen our clients struggling to pay their m ortgages and rents, keep 
their jobs, pay their medical bills, and keep their familie s fed while they wait for a just 
resolution of their claims or their days in court.  
 
Often, while victims of distracted driving struggle to survive, re cover, and make ends 
meet after a crash, the dangerous drivers walk away from the eve nt with little to no 
accountability to their victims or society at large.  Even wh en a dangerous driver carries 
insurance, often the amount of insurance available to victims of distr acted driving cases is 
inconsequential in relation to the harm caused by the dangerous driver. Fur thermore, insurance 
payments to victims and their families are inadequate as they  don’t compensate the State for 
the harms that dangerous drivers cause it, nor do they adequately address the public health 
crisis on our roadways.  
 
We also support this legislative effort because it appropriately re cognizes the secondary 
consequences distracted driving crashes have on families, businesse s, schools, hospital 
systems, municipalities, the State of Maine, and even on state and federal taxpayers. When 
distracted drivers cause traffic crashes, children and familie s often suffer, employers often lose 
employees and productivity, and schools are often unfairly burdened with student and family 
trauma.  In addition, hospitals often end up providing free and reduc ed rate care to victims of distracted 
driving crashes, municipalities spend time, money and resources on e mergency rescue and other public 
services, and state and federal benefit programs like MaineCa re and Medicare can end up paying the costs of 
the distracted driver’s negligence —especially when there is no other insurance or minimal other insura nce 
available.  
 
For these reasons and others, the MTLA supports LD 145’s effort to increase the penalties that people 
pay when they make an election to drive distracted on Maine’s pub lic ways.  Requiring dangerous drivers to 
pay fines of $500 and $1000 for choosing to operate a deadly weapon while  essentially blind pales in 
comparison to the real -life consequences thrust upon victims of distracted driving and their  families after a 
traumatic traffic crash. Similarly, the MTLA supports the notion that appropriate actions should be taken to 
suspend the license of a repeat offender but ask the committee to ensure that the language of the bill is 
appropriately worded and ensures due process. 3   We understand that the proposed consequence of violating  
this law may be hard for low -income Mainers, but we recognize all to well the disparate i mpact on the same 
population when they are victims of distracted driving.  
 
 Thank you.  
 
      Best regards,

are reported to involve a distracted driver,”  and [i]n the United S tates, over 3,100 people were killed and 
about 424,000 were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver in 2019”) located at: https://

2See NHTSA, Distracted Driving (“Using a cell phone  while driving creates enormous potential for deaths 
and injuries on U.S. roads.  In 2020, 3,142  people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted

3If the Committee has not already looked at Maine’s OUI laws  and penalties for comparison, it may wish to 
do so, as driving inattentively can be just as deadly as driving  drunk.  OUI penalties are outline in 29 -A 
M.R.S. 2411  and are also discussed by the Maine Bureau of Highway Safety  here: https://www.maine.gov/ 
dps/bhs/impaired -driving/laws.html  .  The MTLA also urges the Committee to consider the feasibil ity of 
offering driver reeducation and retraining within its distracted driver pena lty scheme.
