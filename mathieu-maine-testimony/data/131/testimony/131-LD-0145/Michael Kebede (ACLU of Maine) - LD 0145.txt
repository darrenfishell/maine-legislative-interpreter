TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, Esq.  
 
LD 145 – Ought Not To Pass  
 
An Act to Increase the Penalties for Operation of a Motor Vehicle While 
Using a Handheld Electronic Device or Mobile Telephone  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  
 
February 28, 2023  
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, good afternoon. My name is Michael Kebede, and I 
am policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Unio n of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U.S. Constitutions through advocacy, education, and litigation. On 
behalf of our members, we urge you not to pass LD 145 .  
 
Under current law, courts can issue fines to people caught driving with a handheld 
device $50 for the first offense  and $250 for subsequent offenses. The bill before you 
would multiply the fine for a first offense by ten, raising the amount to $500, and 
quadruple the penalty for a second offense to $1000. It would also allow revocation 
of licenses for third and subsequent  offenses.  These change s would threaten the 
dignity of low -income Mainers, who often have to choose between paying mandatory 
court fines and necessary living expenses .  
 
Instead of dramatically increasing the penalties to a point that would make paying  
court fines very difficult for people with low incomes, the  ACLU recommends that 
the Committee amend the law  to allow fines of “up to” $50 for the first offense and 
“up to” $250 for subsequent offenses. Additionally, to achieve a truly just syste m, 
the Committee might consider a system that pegs fines to income s. Finland has had 
such a system for nearly a century and might provide a good template.1  
 
A fine of $ 500 for a first offense may be an insignificant amount to an executi ve who 
earns $200,000 a year, or a corporate lawyer whose hourly rate is $ 600 per hour. 
However, that same $ 500 fine might  be a significant burden on a person of more

modest means, for whom finding money for gas or groceries is a challenge. The 
wealthy driver may dash off a check without thinking, but the poor driver could get 
stuck in the legal system for years, paying off the fin e in small monthly increments, 
facing arrest and imprisonment for missed payments.  
 
Increasing the penalty so dramatically also has the potential to exacerbate racial 
inequality in our legal system. A 2020 study by the Stanford Open Policing Project 
found tha t Black people in the United States are 20 percent more li kely than white 
people  to be pulled over by police .2 Thus, this increased fine will likely be levied  
against Black drivers more than white drivers, even though there is no evidence 
they break th e law more often. Also, b ecause single mothers and people of color are 
more likely to be poor, this policy will exacerbate gender and racial disparities in 
the justice system.   
 
We urge the Committee to vote ought not to pass  LD 145. Thank you for your time 
and attention.
