LD 145
Regarding LD 145; If the 2/25/23 SJ article is accurate, Nick Murray, of the of the Maine 
Policy Institute, says legislators need to "resist these and other efforts to punitively punish 
Mainers for low level offenses". Is this truly his response to 2,841 fatal crashes in 2021? I 
hope not. Low level offense? Really?
Fundamental change does not occur in the absence of a SEE. (Significant Emotional Event) 
To most Mainers, a $50 fine is a nuisance, but a $500 fine rises to the level of a SEE, let 
alone a $1,000 fine and license revocation for 2nd and 3rd offenses. I personally have 
avoided two head-on collisions where the driver crossing the line looked up, phone in hand, at
the last second, with a look of horror on their face. I'd rather not do it a third time. 
Respectfully, Larry
