Re: LD 145
Testimony in Support of An Act to Increase the Penalties for Operation of a Motor 
Vehicle While Using a Handheld Electronic Device or Mobile Telephone
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation:
I join you today to testify on behalf of the City of Portland’s Legislative/Nominating 
Committee in support of LD 145, An Act to Increase the Penalties for Operation of a Motor 
Vehicle While Using a Handheld Electronic Device or Mobile Telephone.
Distracted driving has become a major public safety issue in Portland, with few effective, local 
solutions. Studies have shown that using a handheld electronic device while driving increases 
the risk of an accident by as much as four times, making it as dangerous as driving under the 
influence of alcohol. Despite this, many drivers continue to use their phones behind the wheel, 
putting themselves and others at risk.
Deterrence through an increase in penalties is an important tool that we encourage you to 
seriously consider. However, we suggest carefully considering what a fair, effective penalty 
would be, as well as whether the ultimate revocation of a driver’s license after a third offense 
may be too severe. 
We urge you to also consider educational campaigns to change driver behavior, inform them of 
the dangers of distracted driving, and promote safe driving practices.
Thank you for your consideration.
