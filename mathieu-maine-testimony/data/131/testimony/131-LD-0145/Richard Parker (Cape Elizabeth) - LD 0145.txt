Ms. Griswold,u 
Please pass my comments concerning Rep Zeig1er's Bill LD 148 to the legislature members who are currently 
considering this measure. I believe it is being evaluated by the Transpoitation Committee. 
Thank you for your assistance. .

I fully support the legislation you are currently considering to significantly increase the fines and penalties for texting 
and cell phone use while driving - LD 148. These practices are dangerous, unnecessary, put innocent people at risk and 
are way too prevalent on our roads. While enactment of the current level of penalties has had a positive effect, it is 
obvious that they have not gone far enough to prevent these practices. Steeper penalties are in order. It was not until4 
the penalties for drunk driving were made severe that significant progress was made in reducing this practice. 
Dangerous cell phone use requires the same level of attention. I urge you to enact this legislation as soon as possible. 
Thank you for addressing this important issue.
