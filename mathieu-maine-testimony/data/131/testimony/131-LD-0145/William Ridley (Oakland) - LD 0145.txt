It has been my experience that beginning around the peak of Covid traffic police scaled back 
the enforcement of many driving laws, including cell phone use. 
During and since that time many drive_rs developed bad habits in this area of behavior, and 
enforcement has yet to curb that behavior. 
gr) _a daily basis by just casual observation I see people blatantly using their cell phones while 
nvgng. . 
I support increasing the penalties for violoations as described in this bill, but we also need to 
step up enforcement of any and all laws in these areas.i
