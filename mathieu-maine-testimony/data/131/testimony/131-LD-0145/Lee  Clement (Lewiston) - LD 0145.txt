I am in total support of this bill. As a twice retired police officer and executive, I have
personally seen the results of distracted driving more often than I care to recall. I 
continue to see drivers holding a cell phone to their ear while gesturing with their 
other hand, all while meandering thru traffic, oblivious to their actions. 
Motorists of all ages, most of whom will admit they know it is illegal, openly violate 
the current law as they see the penalty as no deterrent. 
With the technology available today there is absolutely no justification for the use of a
handheld electronic device while operating any motor vehicle
