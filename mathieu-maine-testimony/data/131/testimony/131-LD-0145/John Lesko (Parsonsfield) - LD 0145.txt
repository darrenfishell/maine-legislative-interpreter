LD 145
I am against increasing the fines for distracted driving with cell phones because 
criminologists have demonstrated, for many years now, that increasing fines, jail 
sentences, and mandatory sentences etc. does NOT and WILL NOT reduce crime 
generally and fines for distracted driving with a phone certainly applies here.  Instead 
their data demonstrate conclusively that “certainty of getting caught” will reduce 
crime.  Also, the fine system is regressive — thus hurting folks with limited means far
more than those with privelage. 
We Democrats have been correctly criticized for regulating too much and passing 
laws that cannot be properly implemented and, at times, makes the situation worse. 
This critique has been demonstrated to be valid by some unbiased science.  LD 145 is 
a good example of a law that would continue to validate the critique and would hurt 
the very voters, i.e., those with limited means, the very folk that Democrats espouse to
support but continue to lose their votes!
If we really want to reduce distracted driving with cell phones, we would combine 
certainty of getting caught tactics with means testing for current fines.  Just because 
law enforcement is currently overworked does not mean that we should enact 
legislation that would create new problems, burdens, and not solve the problem.
