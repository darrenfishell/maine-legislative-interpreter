Victoria Bucklin
Appleton
LD 145
Good afternoon, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and esteemed members 
of the Transportation Committee. My name is Victoria Bucklin and I live in Appleton.
I am testifying in support of LD 145: An Act to Increase the Penalties for Operation 
of a Motor Vehicle While Using Handheld Electronic Device or Mobile Telephone.  
My husband and I do a lot of traveling throughout the state, and I am appalled at the 
number of drivers I see with their eyes focused in their lap. Just last night as I was 
leaving Rockland I noticed a young woman on Old County Road with her head down,
clearly viewing something other than the road. I had young children in the car and had
to move to the snow filled shoulder of the road to avoid her car.  I’m not sure all of 
these drivers are on a hand-held device, but stiffer penalties should help reduce the 
incidents of drivers not paying attention to the road.  Thank you for considering to 
vote “Ought to Pass” for this bill.
