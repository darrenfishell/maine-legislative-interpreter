LD 1584
Honorable members of the Health and Human Services Committee: My name is 
Lorelei Cimeno, and I am a resident and farmer in Orland, Maine. I am testifying 
today to urge you to support LD 1584. I am sure you have heard from many people 
today about the dire need in our communities for the extension of emergency 
allotments of SNAP benefits. It is important to remember that the benefits of SNAP 
are not just felt by SNAP recipients. SNAP dollars are a great boost to the economy in
Maine, and it’s even better when those dollars are spent locally. I am the organizer of 
the Blue Hill Farmers’ Market. We implemented SNAP acceptance at our market in 
2022. We were pleasantly surprised at the popularity of the new program. Clearly, 
there is a great need for SNAP acceptance to purchase local food in our rural area. 
Shoppers that use SNAP are able to stretch their dollars at the market through a 
program called Maine Harvest Bucks (MHB). The program matches their SNAP 
dollars 2 to 1 in MHB, which can be used to buy fruits, vegetables, and seedlings at 
the market. SNAP acceptance and Maine Harvest Bucks is a great way to diversify 
the customer base at the farmers’ market, make the market and the local food more 
accessible to the entire community, and help farmers. Our sales in 2022 were greatly 
increased by the acceptance of SNAP and MHB. I worry that if the emergency 
allotments of SNAP are not extended, that fewer shoppers that use SNAP will visit us 
at the market. Inflation is not letting up, and wages just don’t seem to be increasing at 
the same rate as inflation. Please consider how SNAP helps Maine farmers as well as 
SNAP recipients, and support LD 1584.
