Full Potential ENE)lNG CHILD HUNGE¥? IN MAENEE 
Testimony of Anna Korsen, Full Plates Full Potential 
In support of LD 1584 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Anna Korsen, Policy and Program 
Director with Full Plates Full Potential, a statewide non-profit working to address childhood 
food insecurity by providing technical and financial assistance to schools and communities to 
help feed kids now, while advocating for the systemic changes necessary to ensure that all 
Maine children have consistent access to nutritious meals. Our strategy is to maximize access 
to USDA Child Nutrition Programs - commonly known as school breakfast, school lunch, 
afterschool meals, and summer meals. 
Today, l’m submitting testimony in support of LD 1584, ”An Act to Provide Funding for the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to Temporarily Restore Benefits Being Reduced 
by the Federal Government." l would like to thank Representative Stover for bringing this bill 
forward to address the hunger cliff experienced by households across Maine. School meals 
are critical tools in addressing childhood food insecurity, but providing food insecure 
households with adequate SNAP dollars is the best way to ensure children have access to 
three meals a day, 365 days a year. To truly address rising food insecurity in Maine, we must 
ensure that low-income households with children have access to both adequate SNAP and 
school meals.

Maine has the highest rate of childhood food insecurity in New England, with 1 in 6 kids lacking 
consistent access to nutrition. Food insecurity during critical developing years too often leads to 
poor health and overall negative lifetime outcomes for children,2 resulting in high costs to 
society? For many students, school meals are the only reliable source of food and the most 
nutritious meals they receive‘ , and Maine's historic law to feed every child at school at no cost 
has helped to increase access to food during the school day. However, when school is out in the 
evenings, on weekends, during vacations, on snowdays, and over the summer, children living in 
food insecure households lose access to those reliable meals. Many schools and communities

operate summer meal programs that are meant to supplement school meals and address 
summer hunger, but those programs only reach about 27% of the kids that need them.5 
in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the federal government put into place temporary 
programs to address poverty, including increased monthly SNAP benefits through Emergency 
Allotments. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, those extra SNAP dollars 
resulted in a 14% decrease in child poverty? Even though food insecurity hasn't gone away, the 
Emergency Allotments ended in l\/larch, resulting in drastic cuts to households ‘ grocery budgets. 
Tied with rising costs of food and other basic needs, the loss of those SNAP dollars means that 
food insecurity is once again on the rise in Maine. For the nearly 38,000 Maine students living 
in households that rely on SNAP7 , the recent cuts to this critical resource are catastrophic. To 
make matters worse, since the end of the SNAP Emergency Allotments, food pantries are seeing 
an increase in demand and are struggling to meet the growing need. Many are reporting empty 
shelves. With summer vacation looming, food insecure students are about to lose access to the 
school meals they rely on for basic nutrition. Summer is often the hungriest time for those 
students, and lack of access to food results in significant set-back in school readiness for those 
kids. 
When the federal government ended the temporary program to provide school meals at no cost 
to all students, Maine stepped in to make sure no child would go hungry at school. We are 
again faced with the opportunity to make sure l\/laine children and their families have access to 
the critical nutrition they need to thrive. l urge you to support LD 1584 to fill the gap left behind 
by the end of the SNAP Emergency Allotments. Maine kids can't wait. 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this important issue. l would be happy to answer 
any questions you have, and can provide more information and be available for the work 
session.
