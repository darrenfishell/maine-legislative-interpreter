Testimony in Support of LD 930
An Act to Allow Only Students of Female Gender to Participate in Women's and Girls' Scholastic
Sports 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:
My name is Nathan Gould. I am from Winterport. I am writing this testimony in support of LD 
930, “An Act to Allow Only Students of Female Gender to Participate in Women's and Girls' Scholastic 
Sports.”
Clear, unambiguous scientific observations show us there are, in general, biological differences 
between the two sexes. Regardless of the inherent physical advantages that many males posses in 
certain areas, it is inconceivable that it would be considered equitable or empathetic to allow male 
and female students such close proximity in sensitive situations. No sane parent wants males using 
the same lockerrooms as their daughters. Regardless of what a male student may call himself, female 
students should not be put in such humiliating and dangerous situations.
I cannot fathom how a culture that spent the past several years decrying the abuse of women 
and highlighting seemingly every accusation of sexual misconduct can also permit girls to be placed in 
harm’s way by allowing biological males to share bathrooms with them. It is irreconcilable to claim to 
work towards a society wherein girls have a fair opportunity to succeed and then allow males to claim 
they are females and then outperform female athletes. These are intense, aggressive hypocrisies, 
symptomatic of a civilization whose moral foundation is crumbling. Our Republic cannot long 
withstand this dangerous, complicit ignorance, this willful subversion of morality, this outrageous, 
futile denial of objective truth. We can continue to reject our Creator, or we can accept reality.
I thank the Committee for reading this testimony, and I ask them to protect our female athletes
and vote Ought to Pass.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
Winterport
