AMERICAN ﬁlllll. LIBERTIES UNION 
Maine, 
~ TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY 
LD 930 — Ought Not To Pass 
An Act to Allow Only Students of Female Gender to Participate in 
Women's and Girls’ Scholastic Sports 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings My name is Meagan Sway, and I am 
Policy Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U S Constitutions On behalf of our members, I urge you to reject 
LD 930 
As drafted, LD 930 would require only “a student of the female gender” to 
participate in “interscholastic or intramural athletic teams or sports activity ” that is 
“designated for ‘females, ’ ‘women,’ or ‘girls ”’ This would exclude nonbinary children 
from girls’ sports teams, but, as written, would not exclude transgender girls from 
girls’ sports teams 
Imposing a wholesale ban on nonbinary youth, or girls and young women who are 
transgender participating in athletics consistent with their gender identity 
discriminates based on transgender status and sex in violation of the United States 
Constitution and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act Trans youth, Just like all youth, 
simply want to participate in the activities they love, including athletics Trans 
students participate in sports for the same reasons other young people do to 
challenge themselves, improve fitness, and be part of a team This bill would deprive 
a subset of students and young people of the opportunities available to their peers 
and, if passed, would send a message to vulnerable transgender youth that they are 
not welcome or accepted in their communities 
Bills that ban trans children from sports are based on the ﬂawed premise that 
exclusion of girls and young women who are transgender benefits non-transgender 
girls and women But in reality, transgender people of all ages have been 
participating in sports consistent with their gender at all levels for years including at 
the Olympics since at least since 2004 and in the NCAA since at least 2011 With 
close to 20 years of clear policies for inclusion of women and girls who are transgender

1n w0men’s events at the h1ghest level of sport around the world, there has been 
absolutely no categorlcal domlnance by Women and g1rls who are transgender 
anywhere Desp1te belng el1g1ble, no transgender female athlete medaled 1na 
Women’s event at the Olymplcs, and only one transgender Woman has ever qual1f1ed 
Athletlc success 1s based on many factors that vary sport to sport Trans athletes, l1ke 
other athletes, do not have a smgle body type, there 1s absolutely no merlt to the clalm 
that women and g1rls who are transgender automatlcally have advantages 1n sport 
In fact, partlcularly when referrmg to young people, many trans athletes have 
phys1ol0g1cal character1st1cs that are typlcal of peers w1th the1r gender 1dent1ty and 
not the1r asslgned sex Th1s means that a glrl who 1s transgender may have more 
phys1olog1cal character1st1cs typlcal of non-transgender glrls than non-transgender 
boys 1 Thus, any data purportlng to compare the relatlve athlet1c ab1l1t1es typ1cal of 
non-transgender g1rls and non-transgender boys s1mply do not apply to most 
trans gender youth 
By slnglmg out transgender Women and g1rls and enactmg a sweeplng ban on 
part1c1pat1on 1n athletlcs, sports ban b1lls such as th1s vlolates both the Un1ted States 
Const1tut1onand T1tle IX of the C1v1l R1ghts Act 
Where a law s1ngles out people based on the fact that they have a gender 1dent1ty 
that does not match the sex ass1gned to them at blrth, 1t necessarlly d1scr1m1nates on 
the bas1s of sex and trans status, thus tr1gger1ng he1ghtened equal protectlon scrutlny 
under the Co-nst1tut1on “[I]t 1s 1mposs1ble to d1scr1m1nate aga1nst a person for be1ng 
transgender W1th0ut d1scr1m1nat1ng aga1nst that 1nd1v1dual based on sex "2 As the 
U S Supreme Court has explalned, “[a]1l gender-based class1f1cat1ons today warrant 
he1ghtened scrut1ny ”3 There 1s no except1on to helghtened scrutlny for gender 
d1scr1m1nat1on based on phys1olog1cal or b10l0g1cal sex-based character1st1cs 4 Th1s 
b111, 1f passed, would separately tngger helghtened scrutlny for d1scr1m1nat1ng 
agalnst 1nd1v1duals based on transgender status In 2020, an Idaho court en]o1ned a 
s1m1lar ban on transgender women and g1rls partlclpatmg 1n Women’s athletlcs and 
reached the “lnescapable conclus1on that the Act d1scr1m1nates on the bas1s of 
transgender status” and thus tr1ggered he1ghtened scrutlny 5 The court reasoned, 
“the Act on 1ts face d1scr1m1nates between clsgender athletes, who may compete on 
athlet1c teams cons1stent w1th the1r gender 1dent1ty, and transgender women athletes,

Who may not compete on athlet1c teams conslstent W1th the1r gender 1dent1ty ”6A 
federal court 1n West V1rg1n1a reached the same c0nclus1on a year later7 
Partles who seek to defend gender-based and trans-status based government act10n 
must demonstrate an “‘exceed1ngly p6I‘S1l3.S1V6 ]ust1f1cat1on ’ for that act1on ” Under 
th1s standard, “the burden of ]ust1f1cat1on 1sk demandlng and 1t rests entlrely on the 
State ” 8 The Mame leglslature has so far has offered no Just1f1cat1on fora 
transgender student sports ban except for hypothetlcal future problems that have not 
ar1sen But under he1ghtened scrut1ny, ]ust1f1cat1ons “must be genume, not 
hypothes1zed or 1nvented post hoc 1n response to l1t1gat1on ” 9 Th1s demandmg 
standard leaves no room for a state to hypotheslze harm and 1mpose a categorlcal 
8XCl1lS1OI1 far exceedlng anythlng ut111zed even at the most el1te levels of c0mpet1t1on 
Applylng th1s standard, the Hecox court en]o1ned Idaho’s ban on women and glrls 
part1c1pat1ng 1n women’s sports solely because they are transgender, f1nd1ng the 
state’s proffered ]ust1f1cat1ons wholly 1nsuff1c1ent 1° 
L1keW1se, 1f enacted, LD 930 Would vlolate T1tle IX of the C1v1l Rlghts Act of 1964 
T1tle IX protects all students —1nclud1ng students who are transgender —from 
d1scr1m1nat1on based on sex T1tle IX states that “[n]o person 1n the Unlted States 
shall, on the basls of sex, be excluded from part1c1pat1on 1n, be demed the beneflts of, 
or be subjected to d1scr1m1nat1on under any education program or act1v1ty rece1v1ng 
Federal f1nanc1al asslstance "11 The overwhelmmg ma]or1ty of courts to conslder the 
lssue have held that d1scr1m1nat1on agamst transgender students 1n schools 1s 
proh1b1ted sex d1scr1m1nat1on under T1tle IX 12 S1nce the Supreme Court’s dec1s1on 1n 
Bostock, at least one federal appeals court has aff1rmed that T1tle IX’s proh1b1t1on on 
sex d1scr1m1nat1on l1kew1se proh1b1ts d1scr1m1nat1on agamst transgender students 
when accessmg smgle-sex spaces and act1v1t1es 13

Ult1mately, laws that ban trans students from part1c1pat1ng 1n sports vlolate the 
Unlted States Const1tut1on and federal c1v1l rlghts law, put Ma1ne at r1sk of loslng 
hundreds of m1ll1ons of dollars 1n federal fundmg, and harm transgender youth, all 
to solve a problem that pla1nly does not ex1st Transgender students already l1ve and
