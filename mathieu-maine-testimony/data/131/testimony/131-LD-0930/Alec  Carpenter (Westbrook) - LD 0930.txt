First of all, there is a grammatical error in the title of this bill. I’m not going to say 
where. Good luck. 
Please do not support this bill. It’s a waste of time and doesn’t protect cis gender girls 
and women at all. Forgetting for a moment that trans gender girls and women are, in 
fact, girls and women and should be allowed to participate in athletics as girls and 
women, this bill declares that there’s something superior about boys and men, that 
they are so much better and stronger and more capable than girls and women that’s 
just not true. It’s offensive to cis gender girls and women and to trans girls and 
women. 
Additionally, how many trans girls are actively participating in athletics in Maine 
schools? Is this a real concern from the people who wrote this bill, a real concern for 
Mainers, or is this a weird moral panic fear based tool to enact control over the people
of Maine and make choices for them and sticking their noses into places where the 
government doesn’t belong? 
Do not support this bill. It’s silly! Sports aren’t this serious. It’s supposed to be fun, 
it’s just games! Let trans kids have fun and leave them alone.
