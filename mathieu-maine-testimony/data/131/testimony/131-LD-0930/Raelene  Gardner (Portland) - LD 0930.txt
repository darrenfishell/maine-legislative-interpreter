Why is this even happening?   We have 2 genders -- since the beginning of mankind.  
A man is not a woman and a woman is not a man.  By God and by law.  The 2 r 
biologically/physically different.  Womens sports will b cancelled if biological men r 
competing against them.  Surely everyone can see this.  
So why r you trying to cancel womens sports?  This bill is attempting to legalize 
discrimination -- which I thought was illegal.  PLEASE kill this bill and save womens
sports.
