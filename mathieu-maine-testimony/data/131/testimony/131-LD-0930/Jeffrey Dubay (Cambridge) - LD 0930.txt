LD 930
L.D. 930 is important legislation at this time. Never before in my time on this earth 
have so many people been so confused about the way they should think and act in 
regard to their gender and sexuality. It is apparent that people with some form of 
mental illness, and those who would support their endeavors, would disrupt common 
sense ways to approach their lives with chaste and circumvent existing rules and 
guidelines in educating children, the most vulnerable among us, how to handle 
themselves out in public. What these people do in their own homes is not completely 
without any regard to law, why would we make things easier for them to evade 
common sense out in public?
