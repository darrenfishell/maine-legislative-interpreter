Dear Committee Members;
Women have fought very hard to get recognition in sports.  There are many great 
women athletes.  Trans women are not biological women.
They still have all the testosterone and muscle of a man.  They DO NOT BELONG in
WOMEN'S SPORTS. KEEP THEM OUT!
I respectfully request that you vote 
OUGHT to Pass on this bill. Thank you.
