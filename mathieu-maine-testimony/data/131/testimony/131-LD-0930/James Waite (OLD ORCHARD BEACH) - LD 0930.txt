LD 930
I'm writing to you in support of LD 930, An Act to Allow Only Students of Female 
Gender to Participate in Women's and Girls' Scholastic Sports.
This bill prohibits any student from joining or participating in an interscholastic or  
intramural athletic team or sports activity sponsored by an elementary or secondary 
school or postsecondary institution that is designated for "females," "women" or 
"girls" except for students of the female gender.
Fair competition in women’s sports remains under attack as male athletes continue to 
join and compete on women’s teams and against women.
Many transgender athletes are still competing in women’s sports with significantly 
higher levels of testosterone than that of biological women.
It’s a denial of science and shows complete disregard for fairness to say that a male 
athlete who identifies as female is just the same as the biological females.
Males don't belong in women's sports, even if they don't always win. Let's protect 
women's sports now and forever. I urge the committee to vote "Out to Pass" on LD 
930.
