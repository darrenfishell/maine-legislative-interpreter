LD 930
Greetings:
I would like to express my support for LD 930.  It is inappropriate for biological girls 
to have to compete against biological boys in supposedly girls sports.  Just because 
someone declares themselves to be a girl does not undo the characteristics of being a 
boy.  Boys tend on average  to be taller, stronger, faster and take these advantages to 
the venue of competition.  Further, these advantages can endanger the biological girls 
by exposing then to unneeded risk of injury.  Further, having to compete against boys 
with a natural advantage can deprive girls the opportunity to win athletic scholarships 
and other educational awards associated with excellence in athletics.  Finally, boys 
should compete with boys and girls with girls.  End of story.
Please vote yes on LD 930.  Thank you.
Robert Smith
