Re: LD 930 ,  An Act to All ow Only Students of Female Gender … in Women’s and Girl s’ Scholastic Sports  
 
Dear Sen ator Carney , Rep resentative  Moonen , and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary : 
 
The Maine Human Rights Commission (“Commission”) , Maine ’s quasi -independent, neutral, apolitical 
State agency  charged with enforcing the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S. §§ 4551,  et seq . (“MHRA” or the 
“Act”) , is charged with :  investigating, conciliating, and at times litigating discrimination cases under the MHRA ; 
promulgating rules and regulations to effectuate the MHRA ; and making recommendations for further legislation 
or executive action concerning infringements on human r ights in Maine.  5 M.R.S. § 4566(7), (11).  Given this, the 
Commission provide s this testimony against  LD 930, An Act to Allow Only Students o f Female Gender to Participate 
in Women ’s and Girls ’ Scholastic Sports . 
 
The MHRA has since 2005 explici tly bar red most Maine schools2 from  making decisions about which  
students  can participate in school activities based s olely on sexual orientation or gender identity .”  5 M.R.S. § 
4601.  After t he Maine Supreme Judicial Court  upheld the MHRA ’s prohibition on  school  gender identity 
discriminat ion in Doe v Regional School Unit 26, 2014 ME 11 , the Commission issued  Guidance providing  an 
affirmative -but-nuanced  framework for  schools to  ensur e inclusion of  students who are trans gender in school  
settings and activities . I am not aware that the Commission has received any complaints filed about athletic 
participation by female students who  are transgender . Because LD 930 would require Maine schools to a dopt an 
unlawful approach to inclusion in school sports th at is based on precisely  the stereotyping and “fear of the other” 
that the MHRA was enacted to counter , and is simply unnecessary,  it should be rejected.   
 
The Commission would be pleased to discuss these issues with you at your convenience, including at the 
work session on this matter.  Thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony against LD  930.   
 
Sincerely,  
 
       Amy M. Sneirson, Executive Director   
 
2 The MHRA covers most schools in the state as e ducational institution s (defined in 5 M.R.S. § 4553( 2-A)) and/or as public 
accommodations (defined in 5 M.R.S. § 4553(8 )(J)).  The protections largely overla p in how they apply to most Maine schools.  
The MHRA educational -institution  prohibition on sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination contain s a carefully -
crafted  exemption for schools operated by religious organizations. 5 M.R.S. § 4602.
