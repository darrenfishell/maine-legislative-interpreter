It
is
unclear
what
this
bill
would
accomplish,
since
its
summar y
r eﬂects
the
wa y
school
spor ts
ar e
alr eady
pla y ed.
Students
identifying

f emale
alr eady
pla y
women ’ s
and
girls’
spor ts.
Students
identifying

male
pla y
men ’ s
and

spor ts.
P erhaps
the
sponsor
is
confused
as
t o
the
diff er ence
between
sex
and
gender?
If
so,
he
should
educate
himself
befor e
attempting
t o
legislate
issues
he
does
not
understand.
Please
