LD 930: An Act to Allow Only Students of Female Gender to Participate in 
Women's and Girls‘ Scholastic Sports 
May 15, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and honorable members of the Judrcrary 
Commlttee my name 1s G1a Drew, and I am the Executrve Drrector of Equal1tyMa1ne, 
whrch has been advoeatrng on behalf of Mame’s LGBTQ+ communrty srnce 1984 I am 
testrfymg today on behalf of Equal1tyMa1ne and Mame Transgender Network 1n 
oppos1t1on to LD 930, An Act to Allow Only Students of Female Gender to Partrcrpate 
1n Women's and G1rls' Scholastlc Sports I am also speaklng today as a transgender 
woman, a lrfelong athlete, and a former hrgh school teacher and athletrc coach of twenty 
years 
Wh1le the language 1n th1s brll may seem to be harmless, 1t 1s 1n fact _]L1S'[ the opposlte 
Sure, We all Want grrls and young women to have unfettered access to sport, but I don’t 
th1nkthat ’s What the sponsor 1s trymg to ach1eve To us, thrs b1l1 appears to be trymg to 
prevent certam grrls and young women from playmg sports And accordmg to recent 
updates to Tltle IX, 1t 1s clear that preventmg someone from partrcrpatmg 1n school 
programs and act1v1t1es cons1stentw1ththe1r gender 1dent1ty would cause harm, and 
would be a v1olat1on of the federal law1 
Here 1n Mame, we decrded long ago that d1scr1m1nat1on 1s wrong and that everyone 
should have the same opportunrtres to succeed In fact, the Ma1ne Human Rrghts Act 
makes 1t clear m Subehapter 5-B EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY The opportunrty 
for an 1nd1v1dual at an educatronal mstrtutron to partrcrpate 1n all educatlonal, counselmg 
and vocatronal gurdance programs, all apprentrceshrp and on-the-Job tra1n1ng programs

and all extracurricular activities without discrimination because of sex, sexual 
orientation or gender identity, a physical or mental disability, ancestry, national origin, 
race, color or religion is recognized and declared to be a civil right 
As the youth mental health crisis deepens, we need to ﬁnd more ways to expand access 
and involve young people in physical activity and sports, not create more barriers 
Young people learn many important life lessons in sports leadership, conﬁdence, 
self-respect, self-discipline, what it means to be part of a team, and much more Sports 
and athletics are an important part of education, something no child should be denied 
simply because of who they are 
Transgender and gender diverse kids, like other students, deserve the same chances to 
learn teamwork, sportsmanship, and to build a sense of belonging with their peers When 
we tell transgender girls that they can’t play girls’ sports, or transgender boys that they 
can’t play boys’ sports, they miss out on this important childhood experience and all the 
lessons it teaches 
We all want to ensure there’s a level playing ﬁeld when it comes to youth sports The 
truth 1S, every child 1S different in different ways — which is why some girls excel at 
gymnastics, others at volleyball, some at basketball, and others at soccer Success in 
school sports is really about practice, self-discipline, access to good coaches and 
facilities, and even money to pay for outside training and off-season travel teams The 
overwhelming 1‘1’121_]OI'1lIy of transgender youth, like most kids, don’t even play at elite 
levels They _]1.1SlI want to play everyday school sports and participate with their peers, 
and that should include transgender and gender diverse youth 
We urge you to vote Ought Not To Pass on LD 930 and appreciate your consideration 
Thank you,
