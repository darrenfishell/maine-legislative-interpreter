 Senat or La wrence, R epresentati ve Zeig ler, and the members of the Joint Committ ee onEner gy, Utilities, and T echnology ,
I am submitting the f ollowing t estimon y on behalf of Sierr a Club Maine, r epresenting o ver22,000 support ers and members stat ewide. F ounded in 1892, Sierr a Club is one of ournation ’s oldest and lar gest en vironmental or ganizations. W e work diligentl y to amplify thepower of our 3.8 million members nation-wide as w e work towards combating climat echange and pr omoting a just and sustainable econom y. To that end, w e str ongly oppose andurge a “oug ht not t o pass” r eport on L.D . 735:AnAct to Requir e the S tate to Hold a PublicHearing in a Municipalit y Bef ore the S tate Constructs a Solar Pr oject in That Municipalit y.
L.D. 735 is a misguided att empt t o hamstring de velopment of solar pr ojects with needlessbureaucr acy. If passed int o law, it will cost the stat e and taxpa yers mone y while deli veringno r eal tangible benefits.
The legislation w ould r equir e the stat e hold a public hearing prior t o commencingconstruction on a solar ener gy pr oject on pr operty o wned b y the stat e. Ho wever, the billfails t o include an y pertinent details t o outline a thr eshold f or w hen a public hearing isrequir ed, meaning this legislation could dela y simple and insignificant pr ojects. This billcould be int erpr eted to read that adding solar panels t o the r oof of a building or o ver aparking lot r equir es a public hearing.
Any requir ements f or the stat e to hold a public hearing will r equir e stat e emplo yee timeand ther efore incur an e xpense t o taxpa yers. F urthermor e, stat e-owned solar de velopmentsare gener ally built t o pr ovide po wer to stat e buildings or infr astructur e. Numer ous studieshave sho wn that solar po wer is substantiall y and r eliabl y cheaper than other ener gysour ces, w hich is near ly always the r eason f or constructing them on stat e-owned pr operty .1

Such pr ojects, then, ar e to the taxpa yers’ benefit . As a fr equent att endee at m y town’splanning boar d meeting, I kno w firsthand that ther e are numer ous opportunities f or thepublic t o weigh in on normal stat e and municipal planning pr ocesses. While Sierr a Clubbelie ves in the importance of public in volvement in go vernment pr ocesses, this bill f ails t ogive an y reason f or a specific carv eout r equir ement that solar pr ojects r ecei ve additionalscrutin y and dela y.
Again, w e ur ge an “oug ht not t o pass” r eport on L.D . 735:An Act to Requir e the S tate to Holda Public Hearing in a Municipalit y Bef ore the S tate Constructs a Solar Pr oject in ThatMunicipalit y. Thank y ou for your time and consider ation.
