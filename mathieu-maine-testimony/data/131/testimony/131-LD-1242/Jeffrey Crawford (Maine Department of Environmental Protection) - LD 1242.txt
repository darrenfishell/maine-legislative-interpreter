RE:  LD 1242  “An Act to Eliminate Certain  Motor  Vehicle Inspection s.”  
 
Dear Senator Chipman , Representative Williams , and Members of the Committee,  
 
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection wishes to convey the impacts th is bill could have on 
Maine’s efforts to remain in compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.  
 
Background  
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require all states (or portions of states) located in the Ozone 
Transport Region, which includes the State of Maine , with Metropolitan Statistical Areas of 100,000 
people or more to implement an annual motor vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) 
program as an ozone control strategy.  Cumberland County is the minimum area in Maine that is required 
to comply  with this requirement.    
 
In 1997, the Legislature passed an emissions testing program for Cumberland County only; this program 
was subsequently approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and became part of the 
Maine State Implementation P lan (SIP).  The SIP is the state’s plan for achieving, maintaining,  and 
enforcing the national ambient air quality standards.   
 
Maine’s I/M program began in January 1999, and requires the following to be conducted at the time of 
the safety inspection:  
 
1) a visual inspection of the catalytic converter on all 1983 and newer vehicles (required statewide);  
 
2) a gas cap pressure test that checks the ability of the cap to limit the release of gasoline vapors on 
1974 and newer vehicles (required in Cumberland County) ; and  
 
3) an on -board diagnostics (OBD) inspection of emissions controls on 1996 and newer vehicles 
(required in Cumberland County).  
 
Today’s motor vehicles depend on the proper operation of a wide range of integrated systems, including 
those related to emiss ions control.  Maine’s I/M program not only helps to reduce motor vehicle 
emissions, but also provides consumers with valuable maintenance information on many of their vehicle’s 
most important components, including the ignition, fuel metering and air injec tion systems, helping to 
LD 1242 “An Act to Eliminate Certain Motor Vehicle Inspections.”

reduce fuel use and save money.  The annual inspection and maintenance program is effective in 
identifying improperly operating and defective vehicle emission control components, some of which may 
still be replaced under warranty.   
Federal Enforcement of the I/M Program  
Since Maine’s I/M program is mandated by the Clean Air Act, the repeal of safety inspection 
requirements for most  motor vehicles could result in the imposition of  federal sanctions  including the 
loss of federal hig hway funding, and ultimately a federally -imposed I/M program for Cumberland 
County.   
 
Implementation of th is bill as written could also be considered “backsliding” by EPA, meaning there is a 
loss of emission reduction credit from our State Implementation Plan.  In this event, EPA would require 
the State of Maine to find additional emission reductions from other emission sources to “make up ” for 
those credits lost.   
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide our comments, and we would be happy to attend the work 
session to answer any questions.
