MADA supports the annual safety inspection of motor vehicles, which we believe benefits all Maine citizens. Miles- 
driven and type of driving, combined with the condition of various roads on which we travel, are important factors to y. 
the safe operation of vehicles. The variety -of weather we experience and the chemicals we use to treat our road-s 
accelerate the deterioration of concrete and pavement, lead to pot holes, frost heaves and uneven road surfaces, and 
added _to miles driven, result in significant wear and tear on motor vehicles. While vehicle owners can readily see 
windshield wipers, glass, and headlights, the deterioration ofbraking systems, fuel and'brak_e lines, exhaust systems, tire 
wear and undercarriage corrosion are factors which automotive “ service professionals should be reviewing annually to 
help the safe operation of motor vehicles. ." 
LD 1242 seeks to eliminate the standards for safety inspection in Section 1751, but leaves Maine State Police rules as the 
requirement for dealers when they sell avehicle. Inspections for vehicles which are sold through licensed new and used 
vehicle dealerships will require an inspection, but private sales, which are significant in number and generally involve n 
well-used vehicles, are not required to have inspections when those vehicles change ownership. The changesin this 
proposal potentially put Maine in violation of the federal Clean Air Act because ofthe elimination of checks of on-board 
diagnostic systems, catalytic converters and gas filler pipe restrictors. The proposal appears to add inspection of some 
currently inspection-exempt vehicles, when sold through dealerships- , with the repeal of section 1752. Lastly, -these 
changes would result in a loss of revenue to the Highway Fund due to the elimination of various safety inspections. 
Thank you for the opportunity to express MADA’s Oggosition to LD 1242-. I would be pleased to try. and answer any 
questions. -
