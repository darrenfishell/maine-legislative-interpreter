Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1242:
“An
Act
to
Eliminate
Certain
Motor
Vehicle
Inspections”
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
Williams,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Transportation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1242.
To
date,
a
majority
of
states
do
not
require
vehicle
inspections
for
safety.
Only
20
states
still
have
these
laws
on
the
books
and
five
of
them,
including
California,
Colorado
and
Rhode
Island,
require
them
only
every
two
years.
1
Maine
would
do
well
to
repeal
these
mandates
on
its
citizens,
too.
Some
claim
that
Maine’s
harsh
winters
and
salty
roads
accelerate
vehicle
deterioration,
and
that
comparing
Maine
to
southern
states
that
have
repealed
their
inspection
laws
is
unfair.
But
winter
conditions
haven’t
prevented
Minnesota,
North
Dakota,
and
Connecticut—which
receive
an
average
of
nearly
50
inches
of
snow
a
year—from
repealing
their
vehicle
inspection
programs.
During
the
State
of
Emergency,
state
vehicle
inspection
and
registration
requirements
were
suspended
for
over
nine
months,
in
order
to
manage
a
threat
to
public
safety.
2
Car
repair
shops
were
deemed
essential,
but
state
inspections
were
not.
If
this
rule
was
crucial
to
ensure
public
safety,
Governor
Mills
would
not
have
suspended
it.
Many
supporters
of
Maine’s
mandatory
inspection
law
assume
that
mechanical
defects
are
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
motor
vehicle
accidents,
but
accidents
due
to
distracted
driving,
speeding,
or
altered
states
are
much
more
likely
than
poor
vehicle
maintenance.
Vehicular
mechanical
failures
are
such
a
minor
factor
in
collisions
that
the
Maine
Department
of
Transportation
just
started
including
them
in
their
most
recent
crash
statistics
report
published
in
2019.
Of
course,
there
is
potential
for
a
crash
to
be
caused
by
more
than
one
factor,
but
the
report
shows
little
more
than
3%
of
the
accidents
from

2015
to
2019
involved
a
vehicular
issue.
Those
involving
tire,
wheel,
steering,
suspension,
transmission,
or
brake
issues
made
up
only
1.75%
of
the
five-year
total.

29-A
MRSA
§1768,
sub-§5
designates
the
authority
of
the
State
Police
to
determine
if
a
driver
is
operating
a
“defective
vehicle,”
including
paragraph
B
which
states,
“A
person
who
violates
this
subsection
commits
a
Class
E
crime
if
the
vehicle
is
unsafe
for
operation
because
it
poses
an
immediate
hazard
to
an
occupant
of
the
vehicle
or
the
general
public.”
4
State
Police
do
not
need
a
vehicle
inspection
requirement
to
maintain
public
safety
on
the
roads.
Please
deem
LD
1242
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
help
more
Mainers
afford
the
already-high
cost
of
owning
an
automobile
here.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
