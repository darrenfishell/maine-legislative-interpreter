LD 1748
Dear Respective Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee,
I am writing to you on LD 1748: An Act to Reform the School Budget Referendum 
Process by Limiting the Circumstances in Which Referenda Occur. If enacted, this 
bill would result in a rubber stamp on every school budget moving forward, by 
default, and disenfranchise voters from participating in the democratic process.
Currently, each community has the ability to determine their school budget validation 
process. LD 1748 overrides this ability. This ongoing effort to centralize government 
only diminishes and devalues the individual and the individual communities.
Here in Cape Elizabeth, our school budget validation process was on the ballot last 
June. Voters overwhelmingly supported sending the school budget to a town-wide 
vote and renewed the process for another three years. Like Cape Elizabeth, every 
community deserves this right to decide what works best for its unique circumstance.
In a time where Mainers are having to deal with inflation and the high costs of every 
day items, LD 1748 would force increased taxes on the people without their input. 
This lack of transparency and discouragement of engagement is alarming. Instead, if 
there is displeasure with the new budget LD 1748 would require the citizens to 
partake in a petition drive that involves considerable commitment.
It is for the above reasons I am encouraging a vote of Ought Not to Pass.
Thank you,
John Lewis
