LD 1748
Local referenda are the hallmarks of democracy. They also facilitate citizen 
involvement in whatever the issue may be.
Automatically bypassing citizen voting on school budgets is an insult to citizens of 
the locality, and it disassociates them from involvement in local education issues.
Loss of citizen control over what for most municipalities is the biggest expenditure 
and biggest driver of the tax rate is far from admirable or responsible. Hiding the 
"automatic approval" under a triennial ballot - which precludes reassessment during 
that three-year period, is similarly disingenuous.
Taking this and other often-contentious issues away from the local forum and moving 
them to state control is a trend unworthy of a citizen legislature.
Please oppose both LD 1370 and LD 1748.
