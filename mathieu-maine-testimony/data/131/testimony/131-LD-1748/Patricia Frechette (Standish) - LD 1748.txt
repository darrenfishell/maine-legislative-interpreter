Dear Committee Members:
WE THE TAXPAYER have a right to vote on the school budget every year.  WE 
THE TAXPAYER are the ones footing the bill.  Our education system is in a shamble
and we should be able to control the $$ of our school systems. This seems to me to be
a bill that takes away the voters rights. 
PLEASE VOTE OUGHT NOT TO PASS, thank you.
