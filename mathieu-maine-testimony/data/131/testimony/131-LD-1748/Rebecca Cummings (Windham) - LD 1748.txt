LD 1748
I write to OPPOSE LD1748. I do not support any legislation which removes annual 
oversight, transparency, or control of school budgets. 
As taxpayers we have a right to participate in budget discussions with school boards 
and town officials, to provide feedback, and hold the forementioned accountable for 
acting outside the will of the taxpaying citizens. 
If anything, taxpayers/legal citizens should be afforded more authority and oversight 
throughout the school district/RSU finance and budgeting processes; not less!
LD1748 Ought NOT PASS
