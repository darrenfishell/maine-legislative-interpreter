LD 1748
I am urging against LD 1748. Tipping the scales of checks and balances towards the 
desires of the school budget and away from the taxpayers would result in inflated 
school budgets, and unreasonable tax increases for local residents. The current system
provides more incentive for school budgets to be trimmed and efficient, else town 
residents could vote it down. Inflated school budgets resulting from this bill would 
likely include more wasteful spending with little or no academic benefit to students, 
while costing more for taxpayers. It is a bad plan.
