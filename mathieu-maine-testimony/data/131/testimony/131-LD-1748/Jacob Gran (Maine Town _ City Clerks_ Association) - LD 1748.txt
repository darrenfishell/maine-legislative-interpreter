Re: LD 1748 – An Act to Simplify  the School  Budget  Validation  Process  
 
Position: Neither For Nor Against 
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association is neither for nor against LD 1748 and we thank 
you for the opportunity to outline our points for your committee. 
 
Members all stated that this type of election results in a very low voter turnout.   
 
Members agree that the timing of the tasks related to this type of election are troublesome, 
since absentee voting generally takes place for 30 days preceding an election, which often 
requires a second mailing of the school budget referendum ballot when this election is held 
on the same day as another election. 
 
The language stating the election must be held within 30 days of receiving the petition is a 
concern.  Clerks suggest this be changed to 30 days after the petition is verified.  It was 
also questioned who would verify the signatures, since this bill states that the petition is 
turned into the school unit board and the verification task isn’t specified in the proposed 
language. 
 
The 20% threshold of the voters who voted in the last gubernatorial election seems to be a 
high request, and members suggested that 15% may be more reasonable.   
 
The Maine Town & City Clerks’ Association appreciates the opportunity to share its  
testimony with the Committee. Should any questions arise, please feel free to contact  me at
