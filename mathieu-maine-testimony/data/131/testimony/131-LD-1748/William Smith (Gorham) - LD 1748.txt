Testimony in Opposition to LD 1748: “An Act to Reform the School Budget 
Referendum Process by Limiting the Circumstances in Which Referenda Occur”
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Bill Smith, I live in 
Gorham and am a strong advocate for individual liberty and economic freedom in 
Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in opposition to LD 1748.
In each town there are most likely a small but interested, educated and experienced 
subset of the citizens who actively involve themselves in educational and financial 
related aspects of local government. Some of them probably get involved by 
reviewing the school budget. This is the way of representative government: people are
active in the areas of government in which they personally have an interest or 
expertise. 
This bill will require those people to continually organzie formally to interupt the 
lives of the town's citizens, many of whom are already actively involved in other ares 
of interest with respect to governing, every time a school budget is presented. 
This is not how a representative government is supposed to function. This testimony I 
am writing is proof of that fact. 
This bill is basically a recipe for local governance failure by slowly but steadily 
pushing school district officials farther away from the local taxpayers who fund them.
So I ask you vote AUGHT NOT PASS for LD 1748. 
Thank you.
