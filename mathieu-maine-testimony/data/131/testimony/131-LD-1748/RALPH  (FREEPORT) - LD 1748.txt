LD 1748
Comment on LD 1748 (and by extension LD 1370):  This proposed Act would make 
public review and approval or disapproval of school budgets tremendously more 
difficult.  That may be the intention of legislators who consider the will of the voters 
to be less valid than the deerminations of administrators and local officials, but it 
would be a step away from democracy.  Totally unaccptable - kill this rubbish.
