In Opposition to  
 
LD 1748 - An Act to Reform the School Budget Referendum Process by Limiting the Circumstances in 
Which Referenda Occur  
 
May 2 , 2023  
 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Educational and Cultural Affairs 
Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am providing testimony in opposition to   
LD 1748 on behalf of Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For reference, the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes 
the position on bills of municipal interest.   
 Municipal officials are opposed to only requiring a budget validation referendum if a written petition, 
signed by at least 20% of the voters that voted in the last gubernatorial election, is submitted. The 
residents in some communities may prefer to validate the school budget while for others it might not be 
a hot topic.  
 Local leaders find the amendment for L D 1370, An Act to Simplify the School Budget Validation Process , to 
utilize a budget validation referendum opt in approach is more appropriate when considering the need  to 
maintain local control and provide the process that works best for the residents within their communities.  
 
For these reasons the LPC is opposed to LD 1748. Thank you for your time and for considering the 
municipal perspective on this issue.
