Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1748:
“An
Act
to
Reform
the
School
Budget
Referendum
Process
by
Limiting
the
Circumstances
in
Which
Referenda
Occur”
Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
1748
.
This
bill
would
simply
push
school
district
officials
farther
away
from
the
local
taxpayers
who
fund
them.
It
would
exempt
school
budgets
from
accountability,
full
stop.
The
irony
is
staggering
considering
the
sponsors
fashion
themselves
as
“champions
of
democracy,”
yet
this
bill
would
usher
in
a
world
where
a
small
handful
of
people
in
each
district
would
dictate
how
much
their
community’s
property
taxes
go
up
each
year.
Today,
school
administrative
units
(SAUs)
must
have
their
budgets
approved
by
local
voters
in
a
referendum,
unless
the
voters
affirmatively
choose
to
suspend
that
requirement.
LD
1748
would
turn
this
process
on
its
head,
allowing
school
boards
and
superintendents
to
write
and
institute
their
own
budgets
without
public
approval,
unless
community
members
gather
signatures
equal
to
20%
of
the
votes
cast
for
governor
in
the
last
available
election.
This
signature
requirement
in
the
current
opt-out
provision
for
local
budget
referendums
is
only
10%
of
the
total
votes
for
governor.
This
is
the
same
for
other
citizen-initiated
local
questions.
1
In
state
law,
the
20%
threshold
is
more
often
used
to
establish
new
local
administrative
districts,
like
a
watershed
2
or
sanitary
district,
3
or
for
voters
to
change
the
format
of
a
local
budget
referendum.
4
Proponents
of
statewide
initiatives
must
only
meet
the
10%
threshold
as
well.
In
other
words,
this
would
be
an
unprecedented
shift
in
how
local
officials
are
held
accountable
by
taxpayers
and
the
members
of
their
community.
If
sponsors,
and
this
committee,
deem
this
standard
appropriate,
will
they
move
to
raise
the
statewide
initiative
signature
threshold
to
20%
as
well?

Or,
is
this
bill
a
blatant
attempt
to
provide
cover
for
ballooning
school
budgets—amid
falling
test
scores
and
climbing
youth
mental
health
troubles—by
obfuscating
local
budget
processes
from
effective
public
scrutiny?
Requiring
voters
to
opt-in
to
transparency
is
anathema
to
the
ethos
of
democratic
and
representative
government.
State
legislators
should
not
diminish
the
standards
of
accountability
for
local
governments
and
school
districts,
the
two
most
consequential
levels
of
public
administration
in
our
lives.
Since
school
costs
are
the
most
prominent
driver
of
municipal
expenses
and
thus
property
taxes,
it
is
beyond
irresponsible
to
remove
these
spending
decisions
from
public
scrutiny.
Please
deem
LD
1748
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
retain
the
current
system
of
local
accountability,
which
if
for
any
reason
should
be
altered,
should
be
in
the
service
of
greater
transparency
and
public
knowledge,
not
less.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
