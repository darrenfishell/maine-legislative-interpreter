LD 1748
Greetings:
I wish to express my opposition to LD 1748.  This bill will give local school boards 
almost unlimited power to spend what typically is the largest segment of a municipal 
budget and to do so without the  approval of the taxpayers. It is a formula for runaway
spending with little or no accountability.  I urge you to vote no on this bill.
Thank you.
Robert Smith
