Re: LD 1748 – An Act to Simplify the School Budget  Validation  Process  
 
Position:  Neither For Nor Ag ainst 
 
The Maine  Town  & City Clerks’  Association  is neither for nor against  LD 1748 and we thank 
you for the opportunity  to outline  our points  for your committee . 
 Members  all stated that this type of election results in a very low voter turnout.   
 
Members agree that the timing of the tasks related to this type of election are troublesome, 
since absentee voting generally takes place for 30 days preceding an election, which often 
requires a second mailing of the scho ol budget referendum b allot when this election is he ld 
on the same day a s another election.  
 The language stating the election must be held within 30 days of receiving the petition is a 
concern.  Clerk s suggest this  be changed to 30 days after the petition is verified.  It was 
also questioned who would  verify the signatures, since this  bill states that the petition is 
turned into the school unit board and the verification task isn’t specified in the proposed 
language.  
 The 20% threshold of the voters w ho voted in the last gubernatorial elect ion seems to be a 
high request, and members suggested th at 15% may be more reasonable.   
 
The Maine  Town  & City Clerks’  Association  appreciates  the opportunity  to share  its
 
testimony  with the Committee.  Should  any questions  arise,  please  feel free to contact  me at
