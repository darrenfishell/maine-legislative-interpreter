Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
T ransportation
Committee,
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco,
and
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
across
the
state
from
various
backgrounds.
I
am
here
to
testify
neither
for
nor
against
LD
259,
otherwise
known
as
the
T ransportation
Budget.
I
would
like
to
preface
my
testimony
by
saying
that
we
are
facing
a
climate
crisis,
and
Maine
has
not
escaped
those
disastrous
ef fects.
Climate
change
impacts
our
environment,
our
natural
resource
industries,
as
well
as
the
overall
integrity
of
our
local
communities.
In
light
of
this,
the
state
must
do
its
part
to
respond
to
climate
change
and
reverse
those
ef fects.
As
you
all
are
aware
of,
the
lar gest
source
of
greenhouse
gas
(GHG)
emissions
in
Maine
is
from
the
transportation
sector .
In
fact,
according
to
Maine
W on’ t
W ait,
54%
of
emissions
come
from
transportation.
It
is
also
no
coincidence
that
we
are
overly
dependent
on
private
vehicles.
Based
on
a
MaineDOT
report,
78%
of
commuters
use
single
occupancy
vehicles
(SOVs)
to
get
to
work,
while
only
0.6%
use
public
transit,
far
below
the
national
average.
In
order
to
reduce
our
emissions,
it’ll
take
more
than
the
electrification
of
vehicles;
after
all,
EVs
are
expensive
even
when
subsidized
and
are
not
accessible
for
all
Mainers.
Therefore,
we
ought
to
also
prioritize
the
state’ s
investment
in
public
transportation.
Public
transit
emits
significantly
fewer
emissions
per
capita
in
comparison

to
cars.
For
example,
a
diesel
powered
bus
emits
33%
less
than
a
car ,
and
an
electric
bus
emits
53%
less.
Considering
how
public
transit
in
Maine
is
severely
underutilized,
there
is
so
much
potential
to
invest
into
it
and
make
it
a
powerful
tool
to
combat
climate
change.
Furthermore,
for
my
generation,
it
is
not
only
about
our
climate.
It
is
also
about
making
an
investment
into
our
communities
in
order
for
them
to
be
sustainable
and
accessible.
Considering
the
influx
of
federal
funding,
the
state
has
a
golden
opportunity
to
make
public
transit
an
af fordable,
reliable,
and
convenient
mode
of
transportation.
It
is
the
responsibility
of
decision
makers
today
to
invest
into
my
generation’ s
future.
I
encourage
the
committee
to
look
favorably
on
Maine
T ransit
Association’ s
request
to
increase
transit
operating
funds
to
$6.8
million
annually .
I
would
like
to
also
emphasize
that
this
step
is
to
simply
maintain
transit
operations
in
light
of
reduced
federal
aid.
There
is
a
bill,
LR
1777,
which
has
not
yet
been
printed,
but
will
call
for
more
operating
funding
to
support
expanded
public
transit
services.
I
also
encourage
the
committee
to
look
favorably
upon
that
bill
when
the
time
comes.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
ef fort
on
this.
