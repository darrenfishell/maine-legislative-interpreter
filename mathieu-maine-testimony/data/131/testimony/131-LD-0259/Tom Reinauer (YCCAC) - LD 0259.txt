ear Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation:  
O
n behalf of the Kittery Area Comprehensive Transportation System (KACTS), I am writing in 
support of the Maine Transit Association’s request for increased state funding for ongoing public transportation operations.  
P
andemic impacts to transit ridership have been significant in Maine. With federal COVID 
relief funding ending later this year, Maine’s transit agencies will need to find replacement funds to continue to provide this essential service in our communities. Relative to other states, Maine’s state contribution to public transportation is low and has been historically flat for the last five years even though operating costs conti nue to rise.  
Y
ork County Community Action Corporation (YCCAC) is a valued partner to KACTS, serving as a 
member of the Policy Committee, and actively partnering on local and regional grant efforts to bring more resources to transit.  YCCAC provides reliable transit services to communities throughout York County, serving over 200,000 residents using eight different flex -routes and 
demand response services. These services provide an essential link to regional shopping, employment, and medical appointments f or many residents, and play an essential role in 
supporting and fueling economic development opportunities for communities throughout the region.
