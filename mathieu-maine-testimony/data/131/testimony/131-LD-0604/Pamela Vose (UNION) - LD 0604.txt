LD 604

TO: Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a lifelong Mainer. landowner and resident of 
Union since 1984.  
I am testifying against LD 604 â€“ An Act to Extend the Night Hunting Season for 
Coyotes to Immediately Following the Muzzle-loading-only Deer Hunting Season
I would like to start out by saying that I am not anti-hunting and appreciate the strong 
hunting traditions enjoyed by generations of my family.  I also appreciate and enjoy 
all of our wildlife and the balance that occurs when nature is allowed to function as 
intended.   Each individual species must be evaluated and managed by scientific 
methods that actually have a chance to accomplish the desired outcome.  It is also 
good to remember that although they often accomplish a lot of good in other areas, 
well financed special interest groups may, at times, have agendas that are at odds with
the goal of producing a stable and controlled coyote population. 
Extending the night hunting season on a species that already has no relief from being 
hunted is counter productive to the goal of controlling the coyote population and 
eliminating nuisance coyotes.   Over hunting and nonstop killing causes more coyotes
to be born than would otherwise happen if the dominant pair were allowed to raise 
and educate their young as nature intended.   Nuisance coyotes are primarily a 
man-made problem because overhunting often results in juveniles without older pack 
members to teach them boundaries and social structure and other necessary skills to 
help them coexist in an ever more human populated habitat. 
I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on this bill.   The science supports this decision. 
Thank you for the opportunity to be heard.
