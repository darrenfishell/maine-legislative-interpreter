Senator LaFountain , Representative Landry  and members of the Committee on Inland Fisheries & 
Wildlife: 
 
My name is Katie Hansberry and I am the Maine State Director of The Humane Society of the 
United States. On behalf of the Humane Society of the United States and our Maine supporters, 
thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in oppos ition to LD 604, which would extend 
what is alread y too long of a season for coyote night hu nting.  
 
Night hunting increases safety risks and poaching . Significant safety risks exist related to the night 
hunting of coyotes. Neighbors, landowners, family pets, and other non -target species could easily be 
injured or killed by the presence of coyote hunt ers working with or without lights. The presence of 
lights at night would also make it nearly impossible for officers with the Department of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife to clearly identify illegal hunting activities, such as poaching.   
 
Please also see my testimony in support of LD 814 which details how indiscrimin ate coyote  hunting 
and trapping is not supported by the best available science, is ineffective at mitigating conflicts, 
does not increase game species numbers, and can lead to an increase in coyote numbers.  
 
It is for these reasons that we do not support an increase in the killing of coyotes in Maine by 
adding days to the night hunting season  and ask that you vote ought not to pass on LD 604.  
 
Thank you for your time a nd consideration.  
 
Katie Hansberry  
Maine State Director
