PLEASE stop allowing coyotes to be killed. period. With all due respect, allowing the
ongoing killing of native wildlife screams to the world the lack of knowing, 
understanding, believing, and following the current basic Science of the condition of 
our life support on this planet: our ecosystems and biodiversity. And add to that the 
worldwide Science and data on the Extinction Crises. Humans have the capacity to 
build pens and more to protect their livestock. Maybe there could be help for those 
who need help building pens to keep their livestock away from wildlife. And for those
killing for sport that is simply AWFUL. For instance through student-building 
projects. Thank you.
