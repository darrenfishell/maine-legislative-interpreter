Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and distinguished members of the 
Committee:
Thank you for considering my comments in opposition to L.D. 604 An Act to Extend 
the Night Hunting Season for Coyotes to Immediately Following the 
Muzzle-loading-only Deer Hunting Season.  
These critical predators are already over-hunted in Maine.  Coyotes are trapped, killed
over bait piles, ripped apart alive by hounds, pursued during the day, during the night,
in their dens, while raising pups, all year round.
Some of these legal forms of hunting including the use of hounds and night hunting, 
are unsporting, lack fair chase, and are disruptive to Maine residents.  
These are not food animals; they are not hunted for sustenance.  The existing 
kill-as-many-as-you-can, as-often-as-you-can policy does nothing to control the 
coyote populations and causes major disruptions to Maine’s wildlife populations, 
disease control and ecological health. 
We need to go the other direction on our coyote “management” policies.  The last 
thing Maine needs is an expansion of this “sport.”
Please vote “Ought not to pass” on L.D. 604.
Thank you for your consideration.
