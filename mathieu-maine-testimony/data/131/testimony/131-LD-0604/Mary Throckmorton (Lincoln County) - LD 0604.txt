LD 604
Dear Committee Chairs and members,
I am writing today to ask you to oppose LD 604.  Coyotes are scavengers, and 
something has to eat those tens of thousands of deer gut piles left in the woods every 
autumn, and also mercifully dispatch the wounded deer which were not recovered. 
Typically in agriculture one of the main tenets is proper disposal of carcasses and 
offal, in order to prevent the spread of disease. If the gut piles left from deer season 
are not quickly scavenged, they could easily overwinter and continue to present a 
health risk in the spring. Let the scavengers scavenge.
Thank You
