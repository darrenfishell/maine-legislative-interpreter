Re: In Opposition to LD #604 "An Act To Extend Night Hunting Season for Coyotes to 
Immediately Following the Muzzle- loading-only season for Deer Hunting" 
April 3rd, 2023 
 
Good afternoon, Sen. LaFountain, Rep. Landry and members of the Committee on Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife; 
My name is Gina Garey; I am a professional animal behaviorist at Animal Behavior and Healing 
in Portland and the Maine State Director for Animal Wellness Action and Center for a Humane 
Economy.  
I appreciate the opportunity to offer testimony in opposition to LD 604, ("An Act to Extend 
Night Hunting Season for Coyotes to Immediately Following the Muzzle- loading-only season for 
Deer Hunting".)  
As a professional behaviorist for canid species, I took great interest in the recent fur bearer 
species planning process by DIFW. I attended the public session offered to observe and 
comment on the outcome of the process, and decisions on incorporating subcommittee 
recommendations for future planning for coyote in Maine.  
Given the proposal to establish a closed season for coyote by a consensus of biologists serving 
on the furbearer species subcommittee, and as we are in full support of that proposal, 
extending any additional time to hunt coyote is unnecessary, and will only add to the wanton 
waste of this Keystone carnivore in Maine. 
There is an abundance of existing hunting opportunity for coyote year- round, rendering the 
need for this measure moot. Further, it is decidedly a step in the wrong direction for the 
conservation of our wildlife and the health and biodiversity of the ecosystem here in Maine. 
I strongly urge the committee to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 604.  
Thank you for your time and consideration.
