Testimony Against LD 604 to Extend Night Hunting Season for Coyotes
Honorable Members of the IF&W Committee, Chairs Senator LaFountain and Representative 
Landry. My name is D. Gordon Mott. I am a private landowner in Lakeville, Penobscot County.
As a Maine licensed Forester in private practice I have assisted Maine forest landowners for the
past 41 years. Together with my wife Virginia, we raised three coyotes in captivity beginning in
1979 at the request of US Fish and Wildlife Service for 17 years – and we kept sheep.  We have
some approximate objective knowledge of Maine coyotes and landowners’ interests. I am 
testifying against LD 604.
I oppose the proposal because it does not require hunters to obtain permission from 
private landowners to hunt to this extreme extent for three quarters of the year night and 
day.
Please see my testimony this date on LD 814 in which I agree with the proposed timing 
modification proposed in this bill if landowners’ permission is required.
Thank you, 
D. Gordon Mott
