DATE OF HEARING:

Senator LaFountain, Representative Landiy, and members of the Committee, I am 
Brian Kavanah, Director of the Bureau of Water Quality at the Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP). I am speaking in support of L.D. 1534. 
The Department administers a multifaceted Invasive Aquatic Species Program that 
includes prevention, early detection, and control. The Department administers the 
program in partnership with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (DIFW). 
The statutory authority for this program was established by the legislature in 2001 and 
2003. 
Invasive plants such as variable leaf-milfoil and brittle naiad displace native plant 
communities. Infestations result in habitat disruption, loss of property values,

L.D. 1534 ~ An Act to implement the Recommendations of the lnteragency Task Force on invasive Aquatic Plants 
and Nuisance Species

diminished water quality, reduced fishing and water recreation opportunities, and 
significant expense for mitigating these environmental and social impacts. 
There are currently 35 known infestations in Maine that include ponds, lakes, streams, 
and rivers. Until recently, infestations had only been found in southern and central 
Maine below Bangor but, unfortunately, in 2019 an infestation was also discovered in 
Washington County. it is a constant battle to prevent and control these infestations. 
We are always looking for ways to improve the program and L.D. 1534 is consistent 
with areas of interest previously identified by the Department and stakeholders. 
In 2001, the lnteragency Task Force on Invasive Aquatic Plants and Nuisance Species 
was established to advise DEP on matters pertaining to research, control and 
eradication of invasive aquatic plants and nuisance species. ln 2021 Public Law, 
Chapter 522 amended the existing statute regarding the role of the task force. Chapter 
522 required that, on or before Januaw 15, 2023, and biennially thereafter, the task 
force submit to the Legislative committees ofjurisdiction for the Departments of 
Environmental Protection, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and Marine Resources a report 
containing its findings and recommendations, including any suggested legislation, on 
matters relating to controlling the introduction of invasive aquatic plants and nuisance 
species in the State. Chapter 522 also required that the Task Force convene a 
stakeholder group in developing findings and recommendations. The Task Force 
submitted this report on January 15, 2023. The next report is not due to the legislature 
until January 15, 2025. 
While the Task Force report did not contain any suggested legislation, the report did identify 
several issues for additional study including: 
1. Methods to expedite and improve the process to temporarily restrict the use of 
watercraft on areas of lakes infested with invasive aquatic plants when surface 
use restrictions are jointly established by the DEP and DIFW.

2. The feasibility of requiring inspections of watercraft put into or taken out of lakes 
infested with invasive aquatic plants or lakes identified by the DEP to be at risk of 
infestation. 
These two issues are similar to the issues identified for study in Section 5 of L.D. 1534. 
The bill requires a report back to the legislature, including any suggested legislation, by 
December 6, 2023. This is approximately one year earlier than the current law. 
The Department believes that the directive of this bill will help to focus the Task Force 
and stakeholder group on these two important issues this year. This will allow any 
suggestions for legislation to come back the current committees of jurisdiction for 
potential action next session, one year prior to the requirements of the current law. 
In closing, enactment of L.D. 1534 will potentially expedite improvements to the Invasive 
Aquatic Species Program. l would be happy to answer any questions you have, now, 
or at the work session. 
Thank you.
