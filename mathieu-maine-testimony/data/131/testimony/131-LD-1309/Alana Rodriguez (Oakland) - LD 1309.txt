I have two children with autism who attended Woodford's Waterville Preschool. My 
son, who is now nine, started preschool at age 3 in another state in a setting not 
suitable for him. It was a mainstream classroom with an ed tech. My son has sensory 
processing disorder, autism, is non-verbal and has severe cognitive delays. He would 
cry before school amd not want to go. Once at school, every day he had meltdown 
that included throwing his shoes. The teacher wrote me almost everyday asking for 
help. They literally tied him to a chair which made him more distressed. When we 
moved to Maine and he began school at Woodfords, he was like a different child.The 
staff saw his strenghts, not his behaviors. They helped him over time be able to 
tolerate school. For children like my son there is no other classroom setting 
approptiate than a program like Woodford's. In Rhode Island we were hindered by our
zip code as to what school he could attend, a school like Woodford's was not an 
option. All children deserve a chance and schools like Woodford's offer the perfect 
balance of education and therapy. Please allow them to help all children who can 
benefit.
