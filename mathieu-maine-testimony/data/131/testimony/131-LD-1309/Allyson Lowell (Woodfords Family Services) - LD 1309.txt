TESTIMONY REGARDING 
LD 1309 "An Act to Clarify Requirements for Payment of Tuition for Children with Disabilities 
by the Department of Education's Child Development Services System" 
April 13, 2023 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Committee on Education and 
Cultural Affairs, my name is Allyson Lowell, and l am the Director of Programs at Woodfords 
Family Services. I am testifying in support of LD 1309. Woodfords is a nonprofit organization 
committed to the support and inclusion of individuals with developmental and intellectual 
disabilities and their families. l also proudly testify as the mother of four children, two of whom 
received significant early intervention services. Our family will be forever grateful for the 
services we received and the way they have impacted our children's long term success. One 
child is currently attending graduate school and the other thriving in a mainstream 4"‘ grade 
classroom. 
Woodfords was founded more than 55 years ago by 5 families who wanted better educational 
opportunities for their children. Early intervention and educational services have been a core 
component of our mission for decades. Five years ago, we were one of the largest providers of 
specialized preschool services in the state. We served 140 children across three schools. 
After years of significant financial losses that threatened the viability of our entire agency, we 
made the difficult decision to drastically limit enrollment, and our census today is just 35 
preschoolers. We closed our wait list of more than 100 families, while we continue to reduce 
our census as children graduate from the program. Without a change in funding, we will phase 
out preschool services entirely in Fiscal Year 2024. 
Conversely, our specialized K-5 program is growing and thriving, and we anticipate consistently 
increasing our census moving forward. 
The Department of Education is legally obligated to provide children with disabilities ages 3-20 
Free and Appropriate Education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The 
chronic lack of adequate funding for specialized preschool education has resulted in the State 
being out of compliance with this federal law. The difference in the funding model for 
preschools compared to K-12 is drastic, and the preschool system is in crisis.

For K-12 students, school districts pay Woodfords and other specialized schools a daily tuition 
rate to cover educational costs, and then we bill MaineCare for the cost of providing children 
with medically-necessary behavior support to meet their treatment goals and objectives. 
For preschool children, the responsibility for providing educational services falls to Child 
Development Services. CDS does not pay for the Specially Designed Instruction or SDI for 
children who have MaineCare, who are the vast majority of students in the program. Providers 
do not receive reimbursement for these educational costs like their K-12 counterparts, and only 
receive revenue from MaineCare for medically-necessary activities. Preschool programs require 
the same infrastructure as K-12 programs, and the daily tuition is critical, funding everything 
from educational instruction and curriculum components to utilities and playgrounds. 
The solution lies in creating parity and consistency in funding for preschool and K-12 
educational programs. LD 1309 directs DOE and CDS to develop a daily tuition rate system to 
reimburse providers for preschool educational services, just like their K-12 counterparts. 
Early intervention has always been a cornerstone of Woodfords' mission. Turning away young 
children in their most critical time of development has taken a huge toll on our staff and Board, 
and most importantly children and families. If this legislation is successful, we look forward to 
reversing course and rebuilding our preschool census. Please support and champion LD 1309. 
The clock is ticking for these kids and it's time they and their families will never get back.
