 
Testimony of Dr. Matthew Siegel, MaineHealth 
In Strong Support of LD 1309, “An Act to Clarify Requirements for 
Payment of Tuition for Children with Disabilities by the Department of 
Education's Child Development Services System” 
Thursday, April 13, 2023 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, I am Dr. Matthew Siegel, Vice President of 
Medical Affairs of Maine Behavioral Healthcare, a member of MaineHealth. I am a child 
psychiatrist and a pediatrician and I have spent my career in Maine building services, training 
providers and advancing research for children with autism and developmental disorders. I am 
here today to testify in strong support of LD 1309, “An Act to Clarify Requirements for Payment 
of Tuition for Children with Disabilities by the Department of Education's Child Development 
Services System” on behalf of MaineHealth.  
We operate the Glickman Lauder Center of Excellence in Autism and Developmental Disorders, 
which serves individuals and their families through a continuum of care, including our Preschool 
and Early Intervention Program. Our preschool is a full year, center-based program that serves 
twenty children ages of three to five with autism. Staff have expertise and advanced training in 
autism and applied behavioral analysis and utilize a multi-disciplinary team approach. Children 
receive up to six hours per day of individualized instruction in communication, play, 
socialization, self-care, cognitive development, and motor skills. Skill acquisition, maintenance, 
generalization and behavior reduction are taught using scientifically validated methods of 
applied behavior analysis. The classrooms are highly structured and have support embedded 
including visual (symbols, schedules, text), sensory equipment, movement breaks, video 
modeling, activity schedules, and augmentative and alternative communication supports. Strong 
family engagement, training and education are also central to the preschool program. Our goal is 
that every child who comes out of this program at 5 years old, despite the severity of their 
autism, is able to communicate, regulate, and has learned how to learn. 
We also operate a k-12 special purpose school for kids with autism and significant behavioral 
challenges.   The way we treat both of these age groups with the best-evidence approach is the 
same:  an ABA program with speech, OT, PT, special education and other services.  The same 
staffing, the same clinicians, the same intensive treatment – the same cost. 
But as Rep. Gattine shared, in Maine we have a very inequitable situation. If a child with autism 
is six or older, and has significant needs being met in a special purpose private school, there are 
two sources of funding – MaineCare and tuition dollars from the Department of Education 
(DOE) or the child’s school district. This co-funding enables providers to meet the medical and 
educational needs of children with autism and significant challenges and have enough 
reimbursement to provide intensive evidence-based treatment.  However, if you are a child with 
 
the same needs, but are five years old or younger, there are no education dollars from Child 
Development Services (CDS) to pair with Medicaid funding.  The burden falls solely on 
MaineCare, eliminating up to half the funding a young child could receive to support intensive 
services.  So, young children, who we should be investing the most in, have a fraction of the 
funding and lose out.  
As a result of this policy, and as we heard from parents and provider agencies today, young 
children in Maine with autism and other special needs have very limited access to evidence-
based treatment programs, and those programs that do attempt to provide a strong evidence-
based model are incurring large losses.  In fact, our program currently has 57 children on a 
waitlist – that’s 57 three to five year olds with autism waiting for a specialized preschool, and we 
lost over $500,000 on this program over the past two fiscal years. This is not right for the young 
children of Maine, and is fiscally unsustainable.   
There is extensive research showing that early, intensive intervention for children with autism 
yields large life-long effects, and those effects are greater the earlier you start. For your 
reference, I’ve attached slides to my testimony which demonstrate the strong evidence. One take-
away I want to give you from the research is that the number 1 predictor of outcome in people 
with autism is communicative ability at age 5.   Age 5.    
Unfortunately, due to the inequity of the current funding structure, young children in Maine have 
exceedingly few preschool programs providing intensive evidence-based treatment. Parents who 
have the means will not infrequently leave our state to move to Massachusetts, Connecticut, and 
other nearby states who fund extensive services for young children. This situation has gone on 
for far too long, and it is time to right this wrong by ensuring that education dollars are provided 
to the children who need it the most, and have been shown to benefit the most - those who are 
five and under.   
In closing, young children with autism and other significant needs in Maine deserve to have the 
same access to co-funding by CDS and MaineCare for special education services and treatment 
as older children.  I urge you to support the legislation before you today and I would be happy to 
answer any questions you may have.
