Testimony of Matthew Pouliot 
L.D. 27 “An Act to Align Maine’s Lead Abatement Law with Federal 
Definitions and to Clarify Lead Abatement Licensing and Certiﬁcation 
Requirements ” 
Public Hearing: Wednesday March 15, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and all esteemed members of the Environment and 
Natural Resources Committee, thank you for allowing me to present L.D. 27 “An Act to Align 
Maine’s Lead Abatement Law with Federal Deﬁnitions and to Clarify Lead Abatement 
Licensing and Certiﬁcation Requirements. ” I am Senator Matt Pouliot and I represent Senate 
District 15, which includes the towns of Augusta, Belgrade, China, Mount Vernon, Sidney and 
Vassalboro. 
This bill changes the deﬁnition of "residential dwelling" in the laws governing lead abatement. It 
also removes the exemption that provides that a person 18 years of age or older who owns and 
personally occupies a dwelling unit in which a resident child has been identiﬁed as lead-poisoned 
need not obtain licensing and certiﬁcation to perform abatement activities within that dwelling 
unit, as long as the person completes any training required by the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
I submitted this bill for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and I will let them 
explain their reasoning for the bill and let them answer any questions that you may have. Thank 
you.A
