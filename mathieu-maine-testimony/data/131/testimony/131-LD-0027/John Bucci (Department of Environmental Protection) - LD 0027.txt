rulemaking process, it was noted that Maine's exceptions to the definition of Residential 
Dwelling pursuant to 38 M.R.S. § 1291 (26-A) need to be amended to better correlate 
with EPA’s definitions of Target Housing and Residential Dwelling. ‘This bill amends the 
definition of Residential Dwelling under Maine's Lead Abatement Law to directly align 
with EPA’s definition to provide greater consistency. This is purely an administrative 
change to promote clarity. 'A
A 
This bill also removes the exemption that provides that a person 18 years of age or 
older who owns and personally occupies a dwelling unit in which a resident child has 
been identified as lead-poisoned need not obtain licensing and certification to perform 
abatement activities within that dwelling unit, as long as the person completes any 
training required by the Department of Health and Human Sen/ices. The removal of this 
exemption ensures that the lead abatement of buildings that are child-occupied are 
appropriately abated by trained and certified individuals. DEP certifies lead 
professionals and works collaboratively with the Maine Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention Program at the Department of Health and Human Services to successfully 
ensure that our respective lead abatement and prevention programs are carried out 
according "to applicablerfederal and state laws for the protection of public health and the 
environment. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session. ,~
