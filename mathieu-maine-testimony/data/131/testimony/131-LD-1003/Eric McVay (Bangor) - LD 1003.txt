Testimony in Support of  LD # 1003 An Act to Increase Access to Behavioral Health 
Services for Children and Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism. 
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee,  
My name is Eric McVay and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate and I am submitting this 
testimony in support of LD 1003, but I do have some clarifying questions about the separation 
between children and adult crisis services.  
If this bill passes, will there be two separate categories? As it reads right now this bill does seem 
a bit confusing if it is only covering children services, adult services, or both. Either way, both 
systems are in need of changes.  
I think this is important because we need an infrastructure in the state of Maine to ensure that 
children and adults who are in crisis aren’t sent out of state to a different placement. Also, we 
need to ensure that folks aren’t languishing in the ER for more than 24 hours at a time. The 
Emergency Room does have the capacity to keep people there for long.  
If people do get stuck there for more than 24 hours, it could get really bad, really quickly for 
some folks. Some people do have severe behavioral challenges and you don’t know what they 
could do. This can lead to people being aggressive toward ER staff because they want to get out 
of there. The hospital may have no other recourse but to restrain, sedate, or seclude the 
individual. This leads to restricting people’s rights because Maine does not have the 
infrastructure to meet people’s needs.  
I would urge the committee ought to pass on this bill.  
Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,
