Testimony in Support of LD # 1003 An Act to Increase Access to Behavioral 
Health Services for Children and Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or 
Autism. 
Senator Baldacci Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee, 
My name is Jon McGovern and I live in Bangor. I am a self-advocate meaning I am a 
person who lives with a disability. I am also an employee of Speaking Up For Us, 
Maine’s Self-Advocacy Network. I am submitting this testimony in support of LD 1003 
because of the care people are supposed to get instead of sitting in a hospital.    
 
I am in support of this bill because if an individual is sitting in the emergency room their 
needs are not being met.  They need to get the care that they need.   It’s important to be 
with people who know what they are doing to help you.   An emergency department is 
not a behavioral health facility.   
 
I urge you to vote in support of this bill.   
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jon McGovern
