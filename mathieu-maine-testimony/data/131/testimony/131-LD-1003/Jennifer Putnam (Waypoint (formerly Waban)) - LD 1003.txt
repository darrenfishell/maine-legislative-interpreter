Written Testimony In Opposition to LD1003 Proposed Amendment  
 An Act to Increase Access to Behavioral Health Services for Children and Individuals with Intellectual  
Disabilities or Autism  
 
April 4, 2023  
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Health and Human Services Committee.  
 
You may recall t hat I provided in person testimony at the public hearing on behalf of MACSP, our statewide 
association of providers . I am providing t his written testimony  in opposition to the proposed amendment to 
LD 1003, however, Waypoint is  strongly in favor  of the bill as originally printed . (Excluding Section 5)  
 
 
My name is Jennifer Putnam, I am the Executive DIrector of Waypoint (formerly Waban). We are located in 
southern Maine and provide services for children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, 
including a Pre -k through Grade 5 school, case management and  day and  residential service s for adults.  
 
Waypoint has experienced first hand how the lack of adequate crisis services affect our members, both in our 
resid ential program  (group home s) as well as through our adult case management program.  
 Our case managers have witne ssed numerous members who have had to leave their group home placement 
due to lack of comprehensive crisis services including crisis beds. When a behavioral crisis ev ent occurs, 
homes that have inexper ienced staff, overworked staff or low staffing numbers require the support of crisis 
intervention services tailored for people with intel lectual disabilities  or autism. Without timely and c ritical 
support, escalated behaviors and violence can lead to an ER visit for assessment and a subsequent inability 
of the  home provider to take the individual back into the home to provide care.  Our case managers have 
worked with the Complex Case Unit to place individuals in another group home, often creating a dynamic of 
a rotating placement to a home with inadequate supports, where the cycle begins again. Waypoint case 
management has also  witnessed no available placement  from the ER, leading to a lengthy  ER stay followed 
by medical transport out of state , where an individual is far away from the ir family and familiar surroundings.  
 
Requiring providers to accept members without assessing the appropriateness of the placement and 
requiring providers to not discharge members who cannot safely be in a group home setting  violates the  
individual ’s rights a s well as the rights of the others in the group home setting. This practi ce, colloquially  
known as ‘ no reject no eject ’, also flies in the face of the Home and Community Based Settings Communi ty 
Rule, which empowers individuals to choose their roommates and requires them to abide by lease terms set forth by the landlord / provider.  
 
OADS currently has only e ight crisis beds throughout Maine for six thousand plus people with intellectual 
disabilities and autism. Often, if a person in crisis cannot have a housemate, the number of crisis beds is 
further reduced. Make no mistake, if Maine wanted to support people with high behavioral nee ds in the state 
of Maine, it could do so with an investment of time and support  for providers. Other states , much larger than 
ours, manage to provide services across the continuum , including a broad array of crisis services and respite 
services whose purpose is to avert a crisis.

I urge you to support only sections 1- 4 of this bill and to consider the unintended consequences of Section 
5. Please vote no on any version of LD 1003 that includes this section as proposed in the sponsor amendment. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.    
Respectfully Submitted,
