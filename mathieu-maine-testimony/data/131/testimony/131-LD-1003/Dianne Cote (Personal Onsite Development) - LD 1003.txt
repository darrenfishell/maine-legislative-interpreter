In Opposition to LD1003 Proposed Amendment
 An Act to increase Access to Behavioral Health Services for Children and 
Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism
 
Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
April 6, 2023
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and esteemed members of 
the Health and Human Services Committee.
My name is Dianne Cote, I am the Executive Director of Personal Onsite 
Development. We are located in Auburn Maine and provide work and community 
support services for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). I 
am in opposition to LD1003 proposed amendment. I am strongly in favor however of 
the bill as originally printed. 
I am in complete agreement with the testimony submitted by MACSP. 
I urge you to support only sections 1-4 of this bill and to consider the unintended 
consequences of Section 5. Please vote no on any version of LD 1003 that includes 
this section as proposed today. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Respectfully Submitted,
Dianne L. Cote
