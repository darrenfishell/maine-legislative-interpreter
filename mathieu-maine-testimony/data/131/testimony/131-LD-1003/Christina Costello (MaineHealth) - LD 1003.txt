Testimony of Christina Costello, MaineHealth 
In Support of LD 1003, “An Act to Increase Access to 
Behavioral Health Services for Children and Individuals 
with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism” 
Wednesday, March 29, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Seivices, I 
am Christina Costello, Nursing Director of Emergency Services for 
Southern Maine Health Care. I have been a Registered Nurse for over 24 
years working primarily within Emergency Departments and as a Director 
for over 15 years. Today, I am here to testify in strong support of LD 
1003, “An Act to Increase Access to Behavioral Health Services for 
Children and Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities or Autism.” 
You have heard this statistic many times. In 2022, 435 children spent 
greater than 48 hours in a MaineHealth Emergency Department (ED) 
awaiting transition to deﬁnitive behavioral health treatment. The average 
length of stay was 5.5 days. This is not acceptable. 
One of those 435 children was a child from a residential program who 
came to the ED with self-harming behavior. When it was determined that 
the child was safe for discharge, the residential program refused to take 
the patient back, stating they were too aggressive and created an unsafe 
situation for their staff. They discharged the child without an alternative 
plan, leaving them to live in the ED indeﬁnitely. 
Just like this child, when a patient presents in crisis, they are taken to 
Emergency Department Acute Psychiatric Unit (EDAP), a locked, 
ligature-free, and safe transitional space for those in crisis, to await 
discharge or transfer to deﬁnitive care. The EDAP Unit is stark, with beds 
bolted to the ﬂoor of windowless rooms. It is not an inpatient psychiatric 
tmit; we do not provide inpatient treatments, groups or therapy. Patients 
wear scrubs for their entire stay. Meals are mostly ﬁnger foods. The only 
utensil they available is a folded scoop spoon. 
The patient care team in the ED who cared for this child bear the physical 
and emotional scars of trauma inﬂicted by children as their aggression 
spills over onto the care team and they bear the moral distress ofa 
healthcare Worker Witnessing a child languish in the same department 
where they work every day to save lives.

This child, who was discharged from a residential program without an 
alternative plan, who should have been discharged back to the community, 
lived in the ED for over a month. The ED is a transitional place for 
stabilization until a patient can be discharged or receive deﬁnitive care, it 
is not a place for a child to live. 
I urge you to support the legislation before you today because the current 
system is not acceptable. Thank you and I would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have.
