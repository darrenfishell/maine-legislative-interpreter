Senator, District 5 131st Legislature Augusta, Maine 04333 
Testimony of Senator Russell Black 
L.D. 44, "Resolve, to Rename the Bridge Between Bingham and Concord _ 
- 
Township on Route 16 the Jason Dore Memorial Bridge." 
Public Hearing: Wednesday February 21, 2023 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and all esteemed members 
of the Transportation Committee, thank you for allowing me to present 
L.D. 44, "Resolve, to Rename the Bridge Between Bingham and 
Concord Township on Route l6 the Jason Dore Memorial Bridge." I am 
Senator Russell Black, and I represent Senate District 5, which includes 
eastern Franklin County, northern Kennebec County, and most of 
Somerset County. 
Jason Dore was a young man from Bingham who served his country 
during the Iraq War. Unfortunately, during his service, he was killed by 
an IED. Dore’s family, along with the Selectmen of the Town of 
Bingham are making an effort to rename the bridge on Route 16 that 
connects Bingham to Concord, currently known as the Kennebec Bridge, 
as the Jason Dore Memorial Bridge. As beneﬁciaries of the freedoms 
that men like Dore gave their lives defending, we have a duty to 
recognize those who served their country to the highest degree of valor. 
Therefore, I recommend the committee pass this legislation to rename 
the Kennebec Bridge as the Jason Dore Memorial Bridge in his honor. 
Thank you.
