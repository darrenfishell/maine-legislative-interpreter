Testimony of Rep. David Boyer 
Presenting L.D. 1894, An Act To Establish a Home Heating 
Income Tax Deduction 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and distinguished members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation, my name is Rep. David 
Boyer and I am proud to present L.D. 1894, An Act To Establish a 
Home Heating Income Tax Deduction. 
My bill would allow taxpayers to deduct the cost to heat their 
residence from their state personal income tax. Currently, state law 
does not allow a deduction from taxable income for home heating 
costs. 
While lower-income households that don’t have an individual tax 
liability would not benefit from this deduction, there are hundreds of 
thousands of Mainers that would welcome this tax-deduction. Given 
that energy costs seem to continually rise, this is a prudent change 
that can be accommodated in a time of record state surplus. 
As my friend, the Honorable Diane Russell, has said in her email 
signature since I've known her, “Heat should not be a luxury item.” 
I appreciate the committee ’s time and consideration and I promise 
this will be the last time I come before you this year.
