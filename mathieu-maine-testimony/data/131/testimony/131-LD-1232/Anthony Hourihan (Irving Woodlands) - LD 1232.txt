 
Testimony in Opposition to LD 1232  
“An Act to Increase Adoption of Solar Power in Maine”  
April 4, 2023  
Testimony of Anthony Hourihan  
Senator Lawrence , Representative Zeigler , and esteemed members of the 
committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology thank you for the opportunity to 
present my testimony in opposition to LD 1232.  
As drafted, LD 1232 would require that all new construction of buildings 25,000 
square feet or larger be solar -ready with a 40% or larger section of r oof 
designated and reserved for solar installation.   The requirements  included in this 
bill would come at a tremendous cost for construction including engineering, 
building and maintenance.  
If you must  make 40% solar ready that equates to 10,000 square feet of panels 
and frames, and mounts, this will add a minimum of 12 tons of extra weight to a 
roof .  Where our operations tend to be in the North, we already incur added costs 
for engineering and constru ction for heavy snow loads , and this will mean any 
future expansion will occur at  even higher costs.  
We believe that someone should determine if investment in a more robust  
building is worthwhile  based on the payback the business can expect by investing 
in solar , not a legislative directive.  
We fully support the transition to a green economy;  however,  we believe these 
solutions should be determined by individual businesses  and urge you to vote 
ought not to pass on LD 1232 . 
 
Anthony Hourihan
