    The Trust is deeply engaged in planning and administering programs to accelerate 
market penetration of high-performance heat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs) in 
Maine. The Trust has been assigned aggressive goals for promoting heat pumps and 
EVs, and has been delegated authority and certain funding to run these programs, 
through various enactments by the Maine Legislature and decisions of the 
Commission.
     By way of illustration, modeling performed for the Maine Climate Council that 
formed the basis for the State’s climate action plan “Maine Won’t Wait” indicated 
that to reach its mid-century (2050) carbon-reduction targets, as many as 487,000 
homes (out of a current total of 550,000 year-round homes) in Maine may need to 
meet their full heating load using heat pumps,
heat pumps would provide between 60% and 90% of all space heating in commercial 
buildings, and
EVs would constitute between 65% and 90% of all light duty vehicle stock.
That is a lot of electrification coming to Maine.
