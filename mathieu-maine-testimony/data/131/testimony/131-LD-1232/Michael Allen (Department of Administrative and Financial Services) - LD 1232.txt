 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
Hearing Date: 4/4/23 
  
LD 1232 – An Act to Increase Adoption of Solar Power in Maine 
 
 
 Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Energy, 
Utilities and Technology Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, 
Associate Commissioner for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and 
Financial Services.  I am submitting written testimony at the request of the 
Administration Neither For Nor Against LD 1232, An Act to Increase Adoption of 
Solar Power in Maine. 
My testimony today is limited to the effects of the bill on property tax 
administration.  Currently, qualifying property purchased to generate heat or 
electricity through solar and wind energy is exempt from property tax.  Section 2 
of LD 1232, which requires the Public Utilities Commission to amend its rules 
regarding small generator interconnection procedures, may have the potential to 
affect who is eligible for net energy billing.  Due to the relationship between net 
energy billing and the solar and wind property tax exemption, it is possible that the 
amended rules could affect eligibility for the exemption under 36 M.R.S. §§ 655 
and 656, but the ultimate effect remains unclear at this time.  
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
