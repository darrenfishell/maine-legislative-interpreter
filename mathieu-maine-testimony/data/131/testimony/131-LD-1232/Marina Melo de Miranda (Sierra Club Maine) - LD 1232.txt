Re:

in
Support

An

Power
in
Maine
 
Senate
Lawrence,
Representative
Ziegler ,
and
members
of
the
Energy,
Utilities,
and
Technologies
Committee,
I
am
testifying
on
behalf
of
Sierra
Club
Maine,
representing
over
22,000
supporters
and
members
statewide.
Founded
in
1892,
Sierra
Club
is
one
of
our
nationâ€™ s
oldest
and
largest
environmental
organizations.
We
work
diligently
to
amplify
the
power
of
our
3.8
million
members
nation-wide
as
we
work
towards
combating
climate
change
and
promoting
a
just
and
sustainable
economy .
To
that
end,
we
urge
you
to
pass
LD
1232:
An
Act
to
Increase
Adoption
of
Solar
Power
in
Maine.
I
have
a
Master
of
Science
in
Energy
Systems
Engineering
and
took
some
specialty
courses
in
Solar
Energy
for
Engineers,
for
this
reason
I
feel
like
I
am
in
a
position
to
make
a
case
for
aggressive
adoption
of
solar
energy
in
Maine.
This
great
investment
in
solar
energy
in
Maine,
especially
when
paired
with
battery
systems,
will
make
the
grid
more
resilient,
since
new
buildings
are
expected
to
be
connected
to
the
grid.
For
this
reason
I
am
in
favor
of
not
only
adding
new
buildings
with
photovoltaic
into
consideration,
but
also
taking
into
consideration
battery
systems.
Earlier
this
year,
I
wrote
an
article
on
grid
resilience,
that
gives
details
on
how
solar
energy
systems
could
be
made
more
resilient
1
.
By
adopting
solar
energy,
not
only
would
we
be
moving
away
from
fossil
fuels
and
importing
energy
from
other
states
and
Canada,
we
would
also
be
saving
more
money
and
creating
more
jobs
with
local
solar
energy.
There
are
places
in
Maine,
specifically
Northern
Maine
where
it
is
difficult
to
find
jobs
that
pay
well.
For
a
short
amount
of
time,
I
worked
as
a
sales
representative
in
signing
people
up
for
solar
energy
from
a
local
solar
farm
that
has
just
been
built.
I
was
laid
off
when
the
solar
farm
became
full.
It
would
be
of
great
benefit
for
people
who
want
solar
panels
on
their
own
roof
and
business
people
who
want
solar
panels
on
their
own
building.
With
that
being
said,
we
need
to
take
into
consideration
that
much
of
Maine
is
heavily
wooded
and
hilly,
which
can
prevent
solar
panels
from
rooftops
from
capturing
sunlight.
If
this
bill
were
to
be
altered
so
that
builders
are
able
to
build
solar
farms
nearby
if
it
is
not
possible
to
have
rooftop
solar ,
I
believe
the
goal
of
making
buildings
solar
friendly
is
feasible.

Additionally ,
the
40%
of
roof
space
designated
for
solar
should
be
outside
of
required
setbacks
for
fire
safety
or
fall
protection,
and
should
not
have
rooftop
units,
vent
pipes,
or
other
obstructions
casting
shade
within
the
40%
of
roof
space
designated
as
a
solar
zone
2
.
We
believe
this
bill
not
only
would
make
the
Maine
grid
more
resilient,
but
would
also
generate
more
local
jobs
and
help
everyone
save
money .
For
this
reason,
we
urge
you
to
pass
LD
1232:
An
Act
to
Adopt
Solar
Power
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
Sincerely ,
