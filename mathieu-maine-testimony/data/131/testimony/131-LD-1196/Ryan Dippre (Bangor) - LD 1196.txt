LD 1196
I am writing in opposition to LD 1196: “An Act to Require Public Schools to Allow 
Parents and Guardians to Opt Out Their Children with Respect to Portions of the 
Curriculum.”  Students learn new things in school.  Some of these things are difficult 
topics that they need to think through carefully.  In doing so, they come to their own 
conclusions about these, which may or may not be similar to their parents.  In short: 
children are individuals, and they come to individual decisions about things they 
experience in the world.  This act would essentially try to short-circuit that by 
allowing parents to opt their child out of things with which they disagree.  This would
not succeed—children will continue to be individuals, coming to their own 
conclusions about things—and it would hinder the complicated process of a 
community deciding what it believes and values.  Deciding what is taught in schools 
is a complex, ongoing, local process involving teachers, administrators, parents, 
students, and other community members.  This act would get in the way of that 
process, and therefore ought not to pass.
