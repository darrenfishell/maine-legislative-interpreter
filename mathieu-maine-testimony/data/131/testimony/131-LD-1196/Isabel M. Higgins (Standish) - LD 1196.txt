Isabel M. Higgins
Standish
LD 1196
Esteemed Chairperson and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee:  My name is Isabel Higgins and I am a resident of Standish.  I am led to 
believe the order of these proposed LD's is specific so that this one can follow the 
lead of 1129 and set up a system to remove children from the classroom when content
is not in sync with a parent's beliefs and values.  Once again, it puts an onus on the 
public school system to provide yet more and separate supervision of children 
removed from class , on short notice and with space for this supervision/alternate 
activity also in short supply.  My overall belief is that if parents have such strong 
feelings about curriculum content being inappropriate or controversial, they should be
home schooling their children to prevent them from being exposed to what they so 
strongly oppose.   However, let them not forget that once their children are finished 
with home schooling with a narrower exposure to life as it exists, they will still have 
to send them out into the real, broader world and hope their children have the skills to 
deal with that life.  Oh, and no cell phones or internet  until age 21 to prevent any 
unintended or unsupervised exposure.   Thank you for  your time and consideration.
