LD 1196 " An Act to Require Public Schools to Allow Parents and 
Guardians to Opt Out Their Children with Respect to Portions of the 
Curriculum" 
 
Good morning, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Committee of 
Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Craig Caffrey of Bowdoinham, and I am submitting my 
testimony in support of LD 1196 “An Act to Require Public Schools to Allow Parents and Guardians to 
Opt Out Their Children with Respect to Portions of the Curriculum.” 
Parents and guardians know what is best for their child or children when it comes to their education 
and wellbeing. They should be allowed to opt out on any curriculum they deemed unfit, goes against 
their beliefs or religious views.  
The United States of America is a Constitutional Republic, and every American is afforded the right 
to choose their own path. One of them being education, and it’s the parents’ right to be able to pick and 
choose what is best for their children. 
I urge this committee to vote “OUGHT TO PASS” on LD 1196 “An Act to Require Public Schools to 
Allow Parents and Guardians to Opt Out Their Children with Respect to Portions of the Curriculum.” 
 
Thank you for your time, 
Craig Caffrey 
Bowdoinham
