Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee: 
As a whole, bills that propose to restrict local curriculum or programming choice or dictate local school 
policy undermine the longstanding practice, enshrined in law, of local control that allows each 
community to determine how best to meet the needs of its unique students. Each bill presented today 
(LDs 1129, 1196, 1199, 1518, and 1643) would create state-level mandates on the curriculum process 
and duplicate local policies already in place. These bills are an unnecessary attempt to supplant existing 
policy for engaging and sharing learning materials and plans._ 
Curriculum remains a local decision per Title 20-A, §2 and in Title 20-A, Chapter 207. Public school 
curricula must be approved by local school boards, at public meetings, where community members are 
Welcome, and encouraged, to attend, participate and influence the decision-making process. 
Additionally, once approved by the school board, that curriculum is available to the public at large, as it 
should be. The Maine School Management Association provides several model curriculum policies that 
include curriculum adoption, review, challenge, and posting. Requiring schools to develop and maintain 
additional resources, to include a database of curricula and guest speakers, adds an unnecessary burden 
to teachers and to an already transparent process. Likewise, local SAUs currently have their own 
policies, to address a parent’s desire to temporarily remove their child from a class or opt-out of a survey 
or evaluations designed to gather health or other information outside of academic assessments. 
The Department believes in and respects a parent's right to be involved in their child’s education, a right 
that is protected under existing policies and local control. We encourage all members of the community 
to engage in this process through existing SAU policies and school board practices. The Department Will 
be available to provide additional information on and respond to any questions during the upcoming 
Work session. 
Sincerely, 
DacuSigned by:
