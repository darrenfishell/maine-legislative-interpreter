Testimony in Support of LD 517
An Act to Allow Maine Families to Deduct Vehicle Excise Taxes on State Income Tax Returns 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Taxation:
My name is Nathan Gould, and I am writing this testimony in support of LD 517, “An Act to 
Allow Maine Families to Deduct Vehicle Excise Taxes on State Income Tax Returns.”
Maine families have always had to be creative and resourceful with their means. Even in a 
milder, more fruitful economy, raising children is an expensive endeavor. Many present with you know 
this from having raised children themselves, and all present know from having once been a 
dependent. This resourcefulness is manifested in budgeting both limited funds and dwindling time. An
essential yet expensive tool for saving time when traveling is, of course, an automobile. 
I would go so far as to assert that for most families in the State of Maine, automobiles are 
necessary, for urban citizens but particularly for rural Mainers. Children must be brought to schools 
and activities, parents must get from their place of employment to the grocery store, to the doctor’s 
office, and so on. There already is a financial burden in owning a car: the initial investment, insurance, 
maintenance, and, of course, fuel. Excise tax adds more to the load on the already exhausted 
shoulders of parents and guardians.
Therefore, I find it entirely appropriate to ease the burden of struggling families by allowing 
them this deduction on their income tax returns. Surely any amount in support of parents and 
guardians would be welcome, giving them more money to work with to meet their numerous other 
responsibilities.
I ask the Committee to vote Ought to Pass, and I thank you for your time.
Respectfully,
Nathan C Gould
