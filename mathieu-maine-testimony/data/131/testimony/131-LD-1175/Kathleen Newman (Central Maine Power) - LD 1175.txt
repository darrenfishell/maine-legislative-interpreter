LD 1175 An Act to Provide for the Review and Uniform Application of All Transmission and 
Distribution Utility Rates 
April 4, 2023 
Testifying: In Opposition 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology, my name is Kathleen Newman, presenting testimony in opposition to 
LD 1175 An Act to Provide for the Review and Uniform Application of All Transmission and 
Distribution Utility Rates. 
The bill requires metering charges to be uniform for customers within a given rate class and 
prevents the PUC from approving non-uniform charges by rate class. The majority of CMP 
customers within a rate class receive standardized charges for their meters. We have 
approximately 5k "opt out" customers who pay an additional fee to maintain an analog meter. 
Those opt out charges which are currently filed with and approved by the MPUC, would be 
precluded under this bill. The effect would be that those charges would be passed on to all other 
customers. 
There are unique metering situations where customers within a rat√©~class do not receive a 
standard charge, though in all instances such charge is approved by MPUC. Preventing the 
Commission from approving the related any charge or fee related to metering that is not uniform 
for all customers taking service in the same rate class would limit choice for those customers 
wishing to utilize novel metering options for their own business purposes or to address unique 
engineering requirements. 
CMP provides transparent and Commission-approved metering charges. If there is any metering 
charge that a customer believes is improper, CMP would be very happy to work with that 
customer and the Commission to address it. We urge an Ought Not To Pass report for LD 1175. 
Thank you for your consideration.
