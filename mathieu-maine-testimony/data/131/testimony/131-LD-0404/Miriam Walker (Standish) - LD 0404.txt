LD 404
My name is Miriam Walker, I live in Standish, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. 
 Our family has spent many hours on Maine's rail trails and have taken several long 
distance rail trail rides in other states; we have driven as far west as Missouri to enjoy 
the long distance experience. On these trips, we support the towns and small 
businesses along the way for lodging, food, biking needs and enjoyment... we meet 
many people from all over using the trails. I believe that LD 404 and LD 1450 could 
not only greatly enhance the draw for out of state bikers, hikers, etc. to come to Maine
but will also be an amazing asset for the health and enjoyment of our local 
communities. We have seen many more people making use of our present rail trails 
since the indoor COVID restrictions whether walking, biking, roller blading, jogging, 
etc. and feel that number will only grow as opportunities are expanded.
 The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for 
walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Miriam Walker
