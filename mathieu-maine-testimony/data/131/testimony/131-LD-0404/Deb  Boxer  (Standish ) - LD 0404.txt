LD 404
Dear committee members,  thank you for the opportunity to comment on LD 404. We 
are so fortunate to have this rare opportunity for so many communities along the way.
From retailers and restaurants to future newly created business the Mountain Division
Trail system will benefit many local economies. There are also the wonderful 
opportunities for so many people locally as well as travelers from away to be able to 
enjoy increased health benefits from walking, cross country skiing and biking. Just 
being out in nature is proven to provide many health benefits.  
I hope you will consider the advantages of this unique opportunity and vote to support
LD404.
Thank you, Deb Boxer Standish ME
