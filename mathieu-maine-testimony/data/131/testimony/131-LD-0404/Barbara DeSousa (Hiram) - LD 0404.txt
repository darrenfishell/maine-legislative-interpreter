LD 404
My name is Barbara DeSousa. I live in Hiram, Maine. I am writing in support of 
LD404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trial. The best use for the
state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and 
runners, which will be accessible to all ages and abilities. This trail extension will 
connect to the 9 miles of the Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in 
Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Barbara DeSousa
