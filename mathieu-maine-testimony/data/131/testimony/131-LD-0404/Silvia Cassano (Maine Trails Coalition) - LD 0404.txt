 
Testimony  in Support of LD 404 
 
 
 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation Committee ,  
 My name is Silvia Cassano . I am speaking today on behalf of the M aine Trails Coal ition, a state -
wide, all volunteer organization  formed in 2019 to champion the establishment, use, and 
stewardship of trails in Maine.  We have supporters all over the state and are part of a growing 
movement dedicated to advancing the trails movement  in Maine .  
 
MTC supports LD 404 the resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the 
Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advi sory Council.  We are grateful for the 
Rail U se Advisory pr ocess and ad vocated for the creation of such a council.  The near unanimous 
opinion (11- 1) to authorize a trail on this unused rail corridor  and support of the communicates  
along the corridor of the trail and extension speaks for itself.   
 The MTC supports this multi- use trail project and corridor as it is one piece to the vision laid out 
in our Maine Active Transportation Arterials document, which is referen ced in the newly 
released, Maine S tatewide Active Transportation Plan.  The Mount ain Division Corridor is an 
important piece of this vision to connect 25 largest municipalities and over 2/3rds of Maineâ€™s 
population  by interconnected off -road, multi -use trails.  
 
Please reach out to us if you would like to learn more. Thank you all for your time  and for the 
opportunity to comment today.
