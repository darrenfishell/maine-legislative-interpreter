LD 404
My name is Andrew Fersch, I live in Portland, ME. I am writing in support of LD 404
to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund 
the building of the trail. 
We spend billions of dollars on motorized infrastructure in a state that rightfully 
prides itself on it's outdoor recreation. We should be able to utilize all of the beauty of
the state without relying on a car, and we should be able to do it safely and serenely 
off of roads clearly not at all designed for bicycles and walkers, and away from 
drivers who increasingly seem impatient about sharing their roads (which is a whole 
different issue). 
I implore you to do right by the people in Maine - commuters, explorers - families 
like mine that just want to be able to take our daughter on beautiful long distance bike
rides (and not have to consider a trip to Ohio or Pennsylvania or Massachusetts 
because they have so many more dedicated bike trails). 
Thank you,
Andrew Fersch
