Dear members of the Transportation Committee,
I am here today as a passenger rail subject matter expert to express my concerns 
regarding the proposed legislation to replace rail tracks with a bicycle path. While I 
understand the importance of promoting alternative modes of transportation and 
addressing climate change, I firmly believe that ripping up rail tracks up to 30 miles 
in length would be an act of economic malpractice and would perpetuate an elitist 
approach that limits future passenger rail services.
Firstly, dismantling rail tracks without a thorough assessment of their potential 
economic benefits and long-term value would be shortsighted. Rail transportation 
plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and connectivity. It provides 
efficient and reliable transportation for both passengers and freight, supporting 
businesses, trade, and tourism. Removing rail infrastructure denies communities the 
opportunity to leverage these economic advantages.
Secondly, replacing rail tracks with a bicycle path may seem like a sustainable 
initiative, but it disregards the potential of integrated transportation systems. 
Passenger rail services are an integral part of a comprehensive and multimodal 
transportation network. By eliminating rail tracks, we hinder the potential for future 
rail expansion, limiting options for commuters and travelers. This approach is elitist 
in nature, as it caters to a specific group of individuals who prefer cycling, while 
neglecting the diverse needs of the population, including those who rely on or would 
benefit from passenger rail services.
Furthermore, combatting climate change requires a holistic approach that combines 
various strategies. Passenger rail is widely recognized as one of the most 
energy-efficient and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. It reduces 
carbon emissions and alleviates traffic congestion. By ripping up rail tracks, we not 
only hinder current efforts to mitigate climate change but also limit future 
opportunities to expand rail infrastructure and promote sustainable transportation.
Instead of dismantling rail tracks, I encourage the committee to consider alternative 
approaches that prioritize the integration and enhancement of existing transportation 
systems. This could include developing greenways alongside rail tracks, allowing for 
both cycling and rail transportation to coexist harmoniously. By doing so, we can 
promote sustainable mobility, support economic growth, and offer a comprehensive 
transportation network that meets the needs of all members of our communities.
In conclusion, ripping up rail tracks up to 30 miles in length and replacing them with 
a bicycle path would be a misguided decision with long-lasting negative 
consequences. It would constitute economic malpractice, hinder future passenger rail 
services, and neglect the importance of integrated transportation systems in combating
climate change. I urge the committee to reconsider this legislation and explore 
alternative solutions that promote a balanced and sustainable approach to 
transportation.
Thank you for your attention.
