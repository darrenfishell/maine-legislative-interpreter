LD 404
I’m Robert Deakin from Standish Maine. I’m testifying in favor of LD 404 and LD 
1450 and the expansion of the Mountain Division Trail. How can we be Mainers 
unless we encourage outdoor activities and recreation. Maine is blessed with a great 
outdoors. I ensured all three of my daughters became Junior Maine Guides. As a 
veteran myself I know we should honor the members of the Mountain Division who 
fought in WWII to defeat fascism, racism and sexism, and other forms of 
discrimination. I support this trail as it’s open to everyone. Together, we can enjoy 
Maine’s great outdoors. Many studies and vast research support the conclusion that 
Exercise improves our health and exercise improves the intelligence of our children. I 
support LD404 and LD1450. Please support the Mountain Division Trail.
