I would love to be able to walk in my town of Brownfield, Maine without the worry 
of vehicles. The extension of the beautiful pathway in Fryeburg, Maine would be a 
great addition for people of all ages and abilities. I have even seen on the Fryeburg 
trail in a wheelchair. Being able to get out in nature is a huge health benefit and can 
be used all year round. Walking, running, biking, roller blading, cross country skiing, 
snow shoeing, etc.
