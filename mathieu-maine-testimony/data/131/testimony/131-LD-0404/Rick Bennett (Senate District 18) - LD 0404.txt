RE: LD404: Bill to Allow Trail Until Rail On Mountain Division Line from Standish to Fryeburg  
 
 
Dear Committee ,  
 
We are writing on behalf of the City of Westbrook to express our support of LD 404, a bill to allow trail until 
rail on the Mountain Division Line from Standish to Fryeburg.   
 
Having seen the benefits of the Mountain Division Trail in surrounding municipalities – specifically next door 
in Windha m – we’re excited to be part of the efforts to help expand the trail and hopefully bring the same 
recreational benefits and opportunities to residents of Westbrook and other communities along the corridor.  
 
In addition to the Western expansion, Westbrook,  along with the Town of Windham, recently  allocated funds 
to complete a cost design summary for an approximate five -mile extension from Route 202 to Westbrook.  
 
We’ve recently seen first -hand a dramatic increase in outdoor recreation – walkers, runners, h ikers, mountain 
bikers, and cross -country skiers, and we’re excited about future health and wellness opportunities that this 
initiative may bring to those seeking similar pursuits.  
 
The resurgence of energy and collective intertest among the nine communit ies on the Mountain Division 
Corridor is extremely promising for our community, as well as the entire region, and we look forward to seeing 
advancement of the Alliance goals.  
 
As a community partner of the Mountain Division Alliance, Westbrook shares the mission to help create a 
continuous 50 -mile trail along the Mountain Division Corridor, from Fryeburg to Portland.  
 
Sincerely,  
Gregory M. Post

Director of Community Services  
City of Westbrook
