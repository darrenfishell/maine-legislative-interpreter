LD 404
My name is Allison Phillips. I live in East Baldwin.  I am writing in support of LD 
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division 
corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 
miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham 
and Windham. My young child and I love to ride bikes and walk the part of the trail 
that is already done, but it is quite a commute for us to get to Fryeburg, so I donâ€™t get 
to take her as much as I would like. Having a safe place for us to walk and bike so 
close to home would be wonderful! I also love the idea of people being able to safely 
travel such a far distance on bikes, without fear of being hit by a car. Extending this 
trail would be such a tremendous asset to the community! 
Thank you,
Allison Phillips
