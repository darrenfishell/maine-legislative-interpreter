Iam a Standish resident who lives very close to the old railroad here in Richville. I 
walk as much as I can and bike too. Route 114 is a high speed road that terrifies me to
walk/ bike on. I have driven to Fryeburg and Scarborough etc and love the trails they 
have. 
I am all for a trail ( no rails) for safe walking and biking. What a wonderful addition 
that would be for residents and tourists alike.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I understand there is a meeting in 
Hiram tonight about this.
Sincerely,
Mary Bowe
