CAROL FARROW
EAST BALDWIN
LD 404
I am a resident of the Town of Baldwin and would like to make my wishes known in 
favor of LD 404, to Implement the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail 
Use Advisory Council. I have used the Fryburg portion of the Mountain Division 
Trail, and am looking forward to enjoying the Steep Falls and Baldwin portion as 
well.
