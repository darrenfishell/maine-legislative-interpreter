LD 404
My name is Nick Walton, I live in Windham and I am writing in support of LD 404 to
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Without this trail, my family would not have easy access for walking or biking 
nearby. 
Thank you,
Nick Walton
