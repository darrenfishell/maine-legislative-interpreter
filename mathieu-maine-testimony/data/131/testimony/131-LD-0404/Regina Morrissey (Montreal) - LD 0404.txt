Regina Morrissey
Montreal
LD 404
My name is Regina Morrisksey, I live in Montreal, Quebec. I am writing in support of
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to 
help fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division
corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 
miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham 
and Windham. With close family in Brownfield, Maine, I visit often and use the trails 
for hiking.
