LD 404
My name is Judy McIlvaine I live in Brownfield. I am writing in support of LD 404 to
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. I 
currently use the Fryeburg section of the trail  , but it would be nice to be able to start 
right in my hometown.  I donâ€™t currently use it to bike on, because of transporting my 
bike.  But with this tail extended bike use would be possible.  And perhaps even more 
than possible, safe to bike.  I have found that biking on rural roads is just not safe, the 
trail would open up a whole new opportunity.
