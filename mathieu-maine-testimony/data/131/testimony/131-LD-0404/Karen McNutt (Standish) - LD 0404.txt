I am submitting Public testimony in support for LD404- Resolve to  Direct the 
Department of Transportation to implement the Recommendations of the Mountain 
Division Rail UseAdvisory Council.
I am writing as resident of the town of Standish and life long land abutters  of the 
Mountain Division Rail Line. 
As abutters to this former rail line we have been saddened  to see this now state owed 
resource  rotting away when it could be used right now for peopleâ€™s enjoyment, 
connecting communities, and creating economic benefits. 
My husband and I have bicycled seven different rail trails from Virginia to South 
Dakota on guided educational adventures. On every trip, we have been amazed at the 
bike and shuttle shops, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, lodgings and stores that 
prosper from the trails.
The reenergizing  efforts of the Mountain Division Alliance and collective interest of 
the nine communities on the corridor is a positive direction for the project and we are 
excited to see its continued progress. 
Sincerely,
Karen McNutt
