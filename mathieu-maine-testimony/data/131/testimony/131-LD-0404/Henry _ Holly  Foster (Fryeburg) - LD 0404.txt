LD 404
We, Henry and Holly Foster of Fryeburg, ME, support LD 404 bill to support the 
completion of the Mountain Division Trail from Standish to Fryeburg. We have 
witnessed the use of the Fryeburg Trail by many people.  It will only enhance the 
outdoor experience by connecting the towns in between to eventually make a larger 
trail from Windham to Fryeburg and hopefully into New Hampshire one day.  It will 
also benefit all towns economically including Fryeburg.  Thank you.
