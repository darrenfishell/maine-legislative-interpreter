Brownfield
LD 404
My name is Chuck Staples, and I am a resident of Brownfield, Maine. 
I am writing in support of the proposals for LD 404 (allow the Mountain Division 
corridor to become a trail) and LD 1450 (help fund building of said trail). 
In my opinion, a best use for this state-owned corridor would be implementation of an
accessible, paved trail for the general public to enjoy such activities as walking, 
running, and biking. 
Creating this trail section and connecting it to the existing 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail trail in Fryeburg and Gorham / Windham would be a great benefit to 
residents and visitors. 
thanks and regards,
Chuck Staples
