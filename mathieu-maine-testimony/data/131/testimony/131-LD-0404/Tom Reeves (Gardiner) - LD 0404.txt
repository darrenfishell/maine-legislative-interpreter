LD 404
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and Members of the Transportation 
Committee
My name is Tom Reeves and I am a resident of Gardiner. I am writing to testify in 
support of LD 404, Resolve to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement 
the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council.  This 
trail will connect western Maine communities with more rural populations to the 
greater Portland area and will be the state's first long distance east-west trail.  It will 
offer active transportation opportunities for residents along the trail as well as bring 
new visitors to experience this scenic trail.  The trail will promote social, economic, 
environmental, and health benefits for all of Maine.  
Thank you for supporting this resolve.
