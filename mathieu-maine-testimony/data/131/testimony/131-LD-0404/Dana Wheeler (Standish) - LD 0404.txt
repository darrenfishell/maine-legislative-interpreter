LD 404
My name is Dana Wheeler, and I live in Standish, Maine. I am writing in support of 
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division 
corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of 
all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham. 
I have used bike paths on Cape Cod and connected bike paths in Florida, and they are 
an incredible resource to connect towns, nature areas, and people with businesses. 
They were always the highlight of my trips there. I think that with these areas of 
Maine being developed more and more, this trail will be an invaluable asset for all of 
Southern Maine. It will help people exercise, enjoy nature, access other towns, and 
connect with other people. It will bring tourists, boost local economies, and make 
young people want to stay in Maine.
When I lived in Connecticut, I lived in a condo, and I had to drive to areas for 
recreation because I couldn't exercise around my condo complex. The local trails 
helped me stay healthy physically and mentally. But some trails were very short. I had
to drive longer distances for longer trails, and even these weren't connected to other 
trails. A continuous trail would allow people in our area an incredible opportunity for 
exercise and a way to access other towns.
I have lived in Standish and Fryeburg, so I am familiar with the resources there, and 
connecting the two towns with Gorham and Windham would connect the lake region 
here with the mountains; access to our diverse geography in southern Maine is a big 
reason that I moved back to Maine. Let's make this more accessible to everyone!
Thank you,
Dana Wheeler
