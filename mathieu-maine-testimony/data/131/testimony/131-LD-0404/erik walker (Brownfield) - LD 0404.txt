Brownfield
LD 404
 as a prior selectmen for 12 years in the town of brownfield maine. i support this 
100%. the boost to tourism in our area would be felt as a trickle down effect. we do 
have small ponds but most have no pubkic access. this trail would allow people to 
enjoy brownfield from the other side of the tracks to say. i encouraged people to 
expand the hiking trails in our town, i saw this as a source or revenue and an untapped
market of outdoor enthusiasts. the trail would do the same. promote healthy living for 
our town and surrounding residents.
