LD 404
My name is Sam Clift, I live in Windham, I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow 
the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. I 
often ride my bike from my house in Windham to the end of the trail in Standish, but 
would greatly appreciate the ability to ride further. This would also connect me with 
family in the Standish and Steep Falls area in a transportation way that is both good 
for the environment and good for myself, and I'm sure it would do the same for many 
other families in the area.
Thank you,
Sam
