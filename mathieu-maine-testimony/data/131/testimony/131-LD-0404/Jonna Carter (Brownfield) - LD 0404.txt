My name is Jonna Carter and I live Brownfield. I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the 
Mountain Division corridor to become a multi-use recreational trail for walkers, runners, bikers, 
skiers, etc. accessible to people of all ages and abilities. I've utilized and enjoyed the Fryeburg 
portion of the Mountain Division corridor since it opened many years ago, and I've been waiting 
eagerly for the continuation and extension of this fabulous multi-use trail.  
 
Thank you, 
Jonna Carter
