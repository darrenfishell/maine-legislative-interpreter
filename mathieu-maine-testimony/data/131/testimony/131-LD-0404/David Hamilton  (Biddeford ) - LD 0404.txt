As a cyclist and commuter from Biddeford/South Portland, I fully support 
development and maintenance of a more expansive trail network in our region. 
Cyclocommuting has proven beneficial for me in the following categories:
-fuel savings
-fitness
-mental health
-work productivity
-time management (serves as a workout)
In addition to my personal benefits, I see a potential reduction in traffic for areas that 
may be served by a more expansive trail system. Furthermore, users will be directed 
through communities vice bypassing them on a busy interstate. This may be impactful
on local economies, by exposing more people to the local communities. In addition to 
local benefits, these trails add interest for visitors, and offer the communities along 
them exposure.
Thank you!
