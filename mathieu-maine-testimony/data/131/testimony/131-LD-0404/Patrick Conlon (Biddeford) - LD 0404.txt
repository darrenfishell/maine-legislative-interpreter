LD 404
My name is Patrick, I live in Biddeford and I work for the Eastern Trail. I am writing 
in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail. The 
best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved or gravel 
trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages 
and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Expanding trails in Maine just makes sense. 
Thank you,
Patrick Conlon
