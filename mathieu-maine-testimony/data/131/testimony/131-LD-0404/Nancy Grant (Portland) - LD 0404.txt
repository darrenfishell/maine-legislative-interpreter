LD 404
To Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Nancy Grant, I’m a resident of Portland and I support LD 404.
Mainers need and want more separate and protected infrastructure for biking, walking
and rolling. Too many Mainers are simply too afraid to walk or bike on our roads. 
Rail Trails provide an extraordinary resource for people to walk and bike safely to 
work, to school, to errands, between towns, to public transportation centers, etc. They 
are a safe option for all ages and abilities.
The Mountain Division Corridor has been out of service for trains for decades. 
Taxpayers have paid to maintain it but they have not been able to use it. Advocates 
have tried in the past to authorize use as a rail trail but the legislature stalled on voting
to make that happen. Finally, in 2022, the legislature developed the Rail Use 
Advisory Council process so that we would have a structure for making these 
decisions once and for all. 
After months of study, research and reports, in April, the Rail Use Advisory Council 
voted 9 to 1 for Trail Until Rail. It’s time for the legislature to comply with the 
process they created, implement the recommendation of the RUAC and authorize the 
use of this trail for a rail trail. 
Thank you.
