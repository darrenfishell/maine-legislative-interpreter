LD 404
Esteemed Chairperson and members of the Transportation Committee: 
My name is Isabel Higgins and I am a long time resident of Standish.  I am writing in 
support of LD 404 which directs the DOT to implement recommendations of the 
Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council. As a life long Maine resident who is 
getting older, not younger, I see a greater need for accessible outdoor trails  , and the 
Mountain Division is a great opportunity for connecting the Sebago Lake area to 
Fryeburg  with a multi use trail that will meet the needs of those seeking outdoor 
activity from cradle to grave. With its multiple points of access/egress, its potential is 
significant.   I strongly urge you to designate this bill as "ought to pass".   Thank you 
for your time and consideration.
