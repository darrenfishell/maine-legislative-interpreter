LD 404
My name is Kerensa, I live in Steep Falls, I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow 
the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Expanding safe trails for Maine residents and tourists alike is never a bad idea. We 
pride ourselves on the outdoor life, being in tune with nature and always exploring in 
a way that preserves native wildlife. This trail is an extension of that. The opportunity 
to connect this many cities and towns with trails should not be passed by. 
Thank you,
Kerensa Higgins
