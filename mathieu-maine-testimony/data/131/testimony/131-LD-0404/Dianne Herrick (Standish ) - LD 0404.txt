I use the Mountain Division Trail at least twice a week if not more all seasons.  I 
enjoy seeing all the different wild flowers, daisy's, Lady slippers, black eye Susans to 
name a few. Also I've seen a variety of wild life, snapping turtles,  turkeys,  skunks, 
deer , once in awhile moose and coyote.
Of course many many types of birds. 
Made many casual friends, dog walkers like myself, runners, bikers. Its a whole 
community stretching 3 towns. I've walked to Westbrook a couple times on. This trail.
So beautiful along the river!! I fully appreciate the trail and extending it is only a big 
boon the other communities.
