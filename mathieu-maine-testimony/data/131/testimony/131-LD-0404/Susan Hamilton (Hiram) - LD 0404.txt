As a lifelong resident of Hiram, I grew up near the RR crossing on the River Road. 
Hearing the train whistle as well as its’ rumble as it passed was part of daily life. The 
train engineer would wave and we always looked for the man riding in the caboose. 
As fond as I am of those memories, I realize that there is little likelihood for trains to 
return to this rural area. There is no need. But we do have a much greater need for 
safe places to recreate that are accessible and free. People need a place to push 
strollers, ride bikes and walk without fear of vehicles. I live on a rural road in Hiram, 
but I do not feel safe riding a bike here. There is no shoulder to get yourself out of the 
way of vehicles which too often are traveling too fast or may be operated by a 
distracted driver.  I have traveled sections of the Eastern Trail and the Mtn Division 
from Brownfield to Fryeburg and I would like to see the Mtn Div trail extended. Let’s
make the corridor useful again.
