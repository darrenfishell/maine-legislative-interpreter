LD 404
Hello,I want to vote for LD404..
I have been hiking n going all over state of MAINE..I find it would be so much better 
to have trail closer to home .I have gone with others n we car pool so much..but this 
trail is needed for now n future families who can bike, walk,,take kids in carriages n 
walk closer to home.It would be nice not to travel some place two hrs to get to hike or
walk or bike..I do want to see this LD404 passed..more folks woulllld use this trail if 
closer to home n not waste timne traveling with little kids..thank you Calista
