Standish, ME
LD 404
My name is Jocelyn Manson and I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the 
mountain division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to fund the trail. The trail is
best used as a place for walkers, bikers, and runners. As an avid outdoors person, this 
trail is beneficial as a place for me to enjoy the outdoors and maintain a healthy 
exercise program.
Thank you.
