My name is Clay Gleason, I live in Waterboro, ME.  I am writing in support of LD 
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. 
The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for 
walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
This project will support the economies of the towns the Trail runs through by 
attracting visitors who use the trail for recreation and who will spend money at local 
businesses. It may also draw families to the region which would benefit our school 
district through increased enrollment. The Trail will also provide additional 
opportunities for our area youth to be outside, engaged in lifelong, healthy activities 
and get them away from screens and electronic devices, a problem that has become 
significant in our society. I am in support of these Bills and the expansion of the Trail.
Thank you,
Clay Gleason
