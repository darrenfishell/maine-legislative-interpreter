LD 404
My name is Eve Boyce-Ratliff, I live in Portland, and I am writing in support of LD 
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. Rail trails are not only important recreational resources 
but can be an economic boon to communities along their path. In areas where rail 
travel is no longer critical, every effort should be made to transition those corridors 
for use in recreation and human-powered transportation. 
Thank you,
