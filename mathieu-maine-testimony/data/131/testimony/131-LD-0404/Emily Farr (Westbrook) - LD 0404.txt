LD 404
My name is Emily Farr, and I live in Westbrook. I'm writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail. This would expand the 
existing and highly used rail trail network that exists in the region, and is an exciting 
opportunity to create a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners. Many of the 
paved biking routes in the area are currently along roads with no or minimal shoulder,
and speed limits that pose risks for bikers. A paved, off-road trail like the Mountain 
Division corridor would provide safe and much-needed opportunities for biking in the
area. I strongly urge you to vote ought to pass.
Thank you,
Emily
