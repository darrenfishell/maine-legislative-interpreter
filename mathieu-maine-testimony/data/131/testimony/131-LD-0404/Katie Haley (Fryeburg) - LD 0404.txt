RE: LD 404 - Resolve to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendations of 
the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council  
 
Dear Committee,  
 
I am writing on behalf of the Town of Fryeburg to express support of LD 404.  Fryeburg is lucky to 
have a 4 -mile section of rail trail in our tow n.  We see daily use of the trail  throughout the seasons and 
while we have not conducted actual surveys, it certainly appears as though the use of the rail trail 
increases each year. It gets used by walkers, runners, bicyclists, cross country skiers, and snowmobilers.  
It has been the location of annual foot races and events that  promote bicycle safety  and is a source of 
pride for the Town.  
 
Locally, we have been focusing on connectivity of recreational assets and businesses and this summer 
are going to be constructing a 1 -mile portion of sidewalk that will lead from the rail trai l to our village 
area which houses local shops and restaurants.  It is very exciting to think that this notion of 
connectivity can expand to other towns in our region, allowing for increased recreational and economic 
opportunities  for all towns.  
 
The Town of Fryeburg was actively involved in all steps of the process undertaken by the Mountain 
Division Rail Use Advisory Council  and offers this continued stated recommendation that the “trail 
until rail” effort be implemented.   
 
Regards,  
 
Katie Haley
