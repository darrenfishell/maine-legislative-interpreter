These rails need to remain intact.Bicycles already have many places to be used. 
Destroying a railroad that can be used for freight,passenger service and civil defense 
should not even be considered.
The rails were removed on the State of Maine owned North Anson Branch last year 
and we are now seeing developing legal action and trail blockage issues by abbutting 
landowners.
