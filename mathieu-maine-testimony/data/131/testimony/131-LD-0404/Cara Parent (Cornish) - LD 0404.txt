LD 404
My name is Cara, I live in Cornish, I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the 
Mountain Division corridor to become a trail. The best use for the state-owned 
Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, 
which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will 
connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg 
and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Cara
