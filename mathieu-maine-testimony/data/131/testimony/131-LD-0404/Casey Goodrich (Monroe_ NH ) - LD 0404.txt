LD 404
I am writing in my testimony for LD 404- in support of resolving, to Direct the 
Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendations of the Mountain 
Division Rail Use Advisory Counsil in addition to also supporting the LD 1450- Act 
to Fund the Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory Council.  
I currently live in the area of Littleton, NH where we recently had some of our rail 
lines torn up because a bill passed to enable the rails to be used for recreation rather 
than transportation/ freight like originally intended.  Many of the individuals from the 
town that I have spoken to would have rather seen the option of recreational use as 
well as transportation use, had that been given an option for us.  From reading the 
Summary and Recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory 
Council pdf, although the cost of creating a multiuse rail is expensive upfront, in the 
long term the revenue coming back would prove to be exponentially greater than that 
of the cost in the beginning. With the mention of connecting the rail lines through 
Vermont, New Hampshire as well as Maine would increase more revenue as it is 
getting more tourism into the state if there were to be a train running as mentioned by 
John T. Sutton in Appendix A.   In addition to the bills above that I am in support of, I
am against bill LD 209 because I believe that keeping current infrastructure that could
be come more important in the near to distant future would be more beneficial  than 
allocating funds to create something temporary rather than utilizing those funds 
towards a more permanent solution.
