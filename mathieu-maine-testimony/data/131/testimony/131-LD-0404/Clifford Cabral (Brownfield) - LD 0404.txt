Clifford Cabral
Brownfield
LD 404
My name is Clifford Cabral, and I live in Brownfield, Maine.
 I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become
a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use for the 
state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and 
runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail 
extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists
in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
I really hope this happens as it will be another reason to live in, and for tourists to 
visit, the great state of Maine!
