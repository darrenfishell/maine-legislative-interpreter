LD 404
My wife and I are in our 70's and our primary exercise is walking.  We prefer walking
on wide paved trails and we walk frequently on the rail-trail located in Gorham.  The 
extension of the rail corridor will provide accessible access to an increased number of 
people of all ages and abilities.
