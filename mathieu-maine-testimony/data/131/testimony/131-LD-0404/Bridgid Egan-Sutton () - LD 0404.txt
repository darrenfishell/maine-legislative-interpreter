LD 404
My name is Bridgid Egan-Sutton, I live in New Jersey, I am writing in support of LD 
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division 
corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 
miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham 
and Windham. 
Although I live out of state, I am frequently in Brownfield, Maine and it is crucial to 
have areas to bike or walk that are safe and accessible for me and my family while 
pushing my child in a stroller or if they want to ride their bike.
These rails should not go unused for another 40 years.
Thank you,
Bridgid Egan-Sutton
