Hiram, part-time resident
LD 404
I am a part-time resident of Hiram and am writing in support of LD 404 and LD 1450.
I have a home near the Mountain Division corridor.  I enjoy bicycle riding but find 
that many roads in the area have poor shoulders and high-speed traffic that make them
unsafe for riding.  The trail will provide a place for recreation and exercise which are 
important for residents' well-being.  In addition, the trail will be an attraction for 
tourists which will be beneficial for the town's economy.  I urge you to vote for 
passage of the resolution and the funding act.  Thank you for your consideration.
