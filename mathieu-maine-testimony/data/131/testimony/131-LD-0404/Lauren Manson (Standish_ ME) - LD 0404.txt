LD 404
My name is Lauren Manson and I am writing in support of  LD 404 to allow the 
mountain division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the trail. The 
best use of the trail is a path for people to run, walk, or bike on. As an outsider I love 
to bike and go for walks on local trails.
