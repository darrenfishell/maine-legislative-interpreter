My name is Pranaya.  I live in Maine and I own the Whistle Stop General store in 
East Baldwin.  The site of the store was historically a linoleum mill, a manufacturing 
site for air-boats, lawnmowers, and a train stop where lumber was loaded and 
refueling occurred.  Our business thrives on thru traffic and with the transformation to
a trail, we would anticipate that thousands of travelers would be interested in making 
short and long trips on the trail.  Trails bring business.  More so, we often struggle to 
find employees and folks are often attracted to living in areas where recreational trails
exist, which would be a benefit to us in finding reliable help.  We would love to see a 
trail become a reality behind our store and to provide a comfortable location where 
tourists and locals can stop on their trip to buy lunch, rest at our picnic tables, refill 
their water or look at a map that would show what lies ahead on their voyage.  I see 
the great economic benefit that a trail will bring to the area and the social and health 
benefits which would come along with it.  I support the recommendations set forth by 
the feasibility study. We will provide a memorable experience and a place to refuel 
for those who stop by the Whistle Stop.
