Emma Bond
Portland
LD 404
To Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Transportation 
Committee:
My name is Emma Bond, I’m a resident of Portland, and I strongly support LD 404.
The existing segment of the Mountain Division Trail already provides a fantastic 
resource for the people of Maine to safely enjoy the outdoors and get from point A to 
point B — without a car. This bill would ensure that a valuable and currently disused 
public resource, the Mountain Division rail corridor, is used to improve the lives of 
people in the state. The strong public testimony in support of interim trails 
demonstrates the pent-up demand for active transportation infrastructure in Maine. 
Especially in light of the recent RUAC approval for this corridor, the time is ripe to 
authorize an interim trail. Please vote ought to pass.
