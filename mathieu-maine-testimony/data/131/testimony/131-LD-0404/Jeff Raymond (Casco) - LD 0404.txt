As shared access on our public roads has become more dangerous to the safety of 
pedestrians having designated trails on retired railroads and other open spaces is an 
intangible asset to our communities.  Promoting access to these healthy activities 
leads to a thriving  population and economy and is something we need to continue 
supporting at all levels of our local communities and state organizations.
