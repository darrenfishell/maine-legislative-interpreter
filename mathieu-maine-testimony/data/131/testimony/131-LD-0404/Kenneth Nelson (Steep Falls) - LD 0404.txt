Good morning, 
My name is Ken Nelson and I live at 565 Middle Rd, Steep Falls, ME 04085.  I would
like to commit my support to having the railway repurposed for a public recreactional 
bike and hike trail.  I was raised in the Northern Virginia area and have witnessed 
first-hand what a similiar repurposing of the Washington & Old Dominion railway 
did for that area many years ago.  It created boundless recreational opportuities to 
countless individuals of all walks of life.  It was an economic boom to the local 
merchants and businesses that existed and subsequently emerged directly from the 
repurposing. To this day, that bike and hike trail continues to enhance the lives and 
livelihood of so many residents and business owners and entire neighborhoods have 
sprouted along its path.  Not investing the money and time to this similar project 
would be the opposite of a public service for the greater good.  Thank you for you 
time.
