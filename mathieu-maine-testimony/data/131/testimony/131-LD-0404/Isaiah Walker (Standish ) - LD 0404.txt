LD 404
Hello, my name is Isaiah Walker I’ve lived in Standish the majority of my life, I spent
my teenage years walking the otter ponds, and the non gated railroad tracks. I even 
ran the mountain division trails a time or two! I think expanding it and making it in a 
location where it’s safe for everyone including teenagers who are walking alone or 
with friends! As one of new business owners at walkers landing I understand the 
importance of keeping our town clean and the Portland water clean as well! But it 
would be awesome if the mountain division could expand along the unused tracks!
