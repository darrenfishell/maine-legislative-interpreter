I am a 28 year Navy veteran who recently finally moved to my house in Windham to 
enjoy my camp in Casco.  I remotely teach Special Forces officers, so I am physical 
fitness enthusiast.  I have enjoyed hiking, in-line skating, and cross country skiing the 
Mountain Division Trail between The Windham Fire House and the end of the paved 
trail in Standish since I arrived back in Maine over a year ago.  It has been absolutely 
essential for both my physical and mental wellbeing.  We need MORE of it.  My wife 
and I have already observed the various sections all the way to the ocean.  Extending 
the trail from Standish to Fryeberg would be an essential addition and would help so 
many others enjoy this incredible resource.
