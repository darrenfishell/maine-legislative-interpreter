Brownfield
LD 404
My name is Hollie Hazzard and I live in Brownfield, ME. I'm writing in support of 
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD1450 to help
fund the building of said trail. 
The best use for the state-owned Mt Division corridor is a wide paved trail for 
walkers, bikers and runners -- which will be accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. 
Maine has the oldest people in the country -- to have a way to get outside and walk, 
get fresh air, see people, keep moving, will go a long way to helping stay healthy and 
active within our communities.
