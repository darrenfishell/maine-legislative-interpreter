LD 404
Hello,
My name is Nik Bergill and I am a Maine resident writing in support of LD 404, An 
Act to Authorize a rail trail between Standish and Fryeburg I have lived in both urban 
and rural settings in Maine, and I have come to realize the vital importance of 
prioritizing small and/or human-powered transport over cars in scenario. 
The creation of a rail trail connecting Portland, Falmouth, Cumberland, Yarmouth, 
North Yarmouth, Pownal, New Gloucester, and Auburn would not only provide 
recreation opportunity, it would reduce commuter traffic and incentivize young 
Mainers to consider investing in communities beyond Portland. Rail trails make lives 
better, and I hope that you will authorize this unused rail corridor for more 
human-powered transit.
