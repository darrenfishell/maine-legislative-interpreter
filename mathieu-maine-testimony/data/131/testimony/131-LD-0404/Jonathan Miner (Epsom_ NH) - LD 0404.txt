I strongly urge the citizens of Maine to not remove the rails from the former Mountain
Division.  Leaving the rails in place, and building a trail alongside makes the trail 
more open to a wider variety of trail users, encouraging more people to use the trails, 
and encouraging more people to join volunteer organizations which support the trails. 
One of the Nation's most recognized examples is the Cotton Valley Rail Trail in 
Wolfeboro NH, which has been a successful collaboration among railroad enthusiasts,
snowmobile clubs, walkers, joggers, bikers, cross-country skiers.
The trail supporters who claim that this will bring tourism are simply wrong. There 
continues to be no evidence that people are travelling to walk a rail trail; they are used
by locals, people who are already in the communities and already spending money 
locally.  There are a few people who "collect" mileage, and will visit an area to visit a 
trail, but only once.  If the rails are kept in place, the Mountain Division will remain a 
destination for railroad enthusiasts, and they will visit year after year, supporting local
businesses.
As others will probably say, it costs nothing to leave the rails in place. More funding 
can be dedicated toward building the trail, and there's no worries of disposing of 
railroad ties and other debris  Despite promises from some groups, scrapping the rail 
does not cover the cost of building the trail, and in NH we've seen cases where used 
ties were simply left in the woods instead of being disposed. 
Please support a multiuse trail, leaving the rails in place, to preserve the history of the 
corridor for future generations.
Thank you for your time.
