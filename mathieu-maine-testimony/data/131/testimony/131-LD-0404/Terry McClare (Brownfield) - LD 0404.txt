LD 404
My Name is Terry McClare, I live in Brownfield me. I'm writing in support of LD404
to help fund the building of the mountain division trail.The best use for the state 
owned mountain division corridor is a wide paved trail for walking ,biking, running. 
Which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will 
connect the 9 miles of the mountain division rail trail that already exists in Fryeburg 
and Gorham and Windham.  Thank -you Terry McClare
