Hello,
        I think the trail is a wonderful idea. Not only will it provide a much wider range 
of possible experiences to nature for people of many different types of physical 
dexterity, some of whom may no longer be able to traverse more difficult mountain 
trails, but it will also provide an alluring way for people to exercise. Often people are 
deterred from exercise because they don't have a place to do so that they enjoy. 
        Not only do I think that this trail will provide that but I think it will also increase 
foot traffic and patronage for town businesses adjacent to the trail. In that thought I 
am thinking I would thoroughly enjoy riding a bicycle along that route and stopping 
at a town along the trail for lunch. I am often in Maine visiting my parents who are 
year-round Maine residents in Brownfield. 
Best regards,
                  Joe Egan
