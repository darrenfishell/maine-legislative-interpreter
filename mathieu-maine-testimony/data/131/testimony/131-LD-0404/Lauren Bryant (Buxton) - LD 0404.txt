LD 404
My name is Lauren Bryant.  I live in Buxton.  I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1459 to help find the 
building of the trail.  The best use of the state owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities.  This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham.
Thank you,
Lauren Bryant
