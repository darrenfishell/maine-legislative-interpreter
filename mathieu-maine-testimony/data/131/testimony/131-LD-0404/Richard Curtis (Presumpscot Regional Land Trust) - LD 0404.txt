LD 404
I am a long term resident of Gorham and for many years have been looking forward 
to the opportunity to support the extension of the Mountain Division corridor both 
into Westbrook and out to Fryeburg.  I enthusiastically  support LD 404 to allow the 
Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building of 
the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved 
trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and abilities. 
This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division rail-trail that 
already exists in Gorham and Windham.
