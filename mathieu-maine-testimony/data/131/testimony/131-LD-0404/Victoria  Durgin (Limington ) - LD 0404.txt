LD 404
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and esteemed colleagues of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation: My name is Victoria Durgin, I live in 
Limington. I am writing in support of LD 404 & LD 1450. The best use for the 
Mountain Division Line is a trail until rail as recommended by the Rail Use Advisory 
Council. 
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.
Thank you,
 Victoria Durgin
