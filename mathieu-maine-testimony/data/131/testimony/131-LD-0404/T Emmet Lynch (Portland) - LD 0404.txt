T Emmet Lynch
Portland
LD 404
My name is Emmet Lynch, 
I live in Portland, and I wanted to show my enthusiasm for supporting the proposed 
amendment to LD 404 to "Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the Recommendation of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory 
Council." If this trail were in place I would use it with my friends and family many 
weekends during the warm months on bikes and during the cold ones on XC skis! Not
only would it be a good trail to ride on its own, but it would allow people to connect 
other routes that they might already ride in Portland or Auburn or anywhere between 
the two!
