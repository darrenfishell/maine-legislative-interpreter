Members of the Transportation Committee:
My name is Kelley and I am a resident of Bath. I am writing to testify in strong 
support of LD 404.
Having a multi-use trail through these communities would be an incredible resource 
for Maine.
As a cyclist I have seen first hand how dangerous our roads have become for 
non-vehicle users. Mainers and visitors alike deserve safer spaces to recreate. 
Multi-use rail trails provide this opportunity. Additionally, due to the gentle grade and
wide nature rail trails this would allow access to the outdoors for many people who 
otherwise could not access other public trails due to roots, rocks, and other terrain 
features. 
A few weekends ago I visited a section of the Eastern Trail in Scarborough and was 
delighted to see it full of different trails users and passed multiple packed parking lots.
I for one am very excited about the prospect of this new trail and I know the people of
Maine would utilize it.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this trail,
Kelley
