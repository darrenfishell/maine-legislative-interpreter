Rosanne Griffin
North Yarmouth 
LD 404
My name is Rosanne Griffin of North Yarmouth and I OPPOSE  LD 404, 209 & LD 
1450. We need to preserve our rails for future use for passenger and transportation of 
goods. 
I love trails and bike riding but not when it comes at the cost of losing our important 
rail system. Once rails are removed it would be far too costly for it to be put back. 
Thank you.
