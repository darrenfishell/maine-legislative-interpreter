As a resident of Standish, I support the development of the Mountain Division [Rail] 
Trail. 
As an older person, having a good, walkable trail close by is important to me. In 
addition, I have to think the Trail would bring in other walkers, runners, bikers, and 
hikers from around the area, if not the state and New England. This would be a 
benefit to the towns along the Trail.
