Hello, The need for this trail is 2 fold ( many fold actually) 1 is a commuting corridor 
and 2 is a vacation corridor. People will fly into Portland bike through the whites and 
leave through Portland. As many other States have experienced the Corridor will 
create it’s own industry, Hotels, Stores, Restaurants, Campgrounds, etc.
