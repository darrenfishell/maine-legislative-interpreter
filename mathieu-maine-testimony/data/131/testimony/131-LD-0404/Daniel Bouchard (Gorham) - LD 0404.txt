LD 404
I live within a mile of the Mountain Division Trail and utilize the trail at least once 
per week for nine months of the year.
It is a well used trail and I often see families, couples, single users spend hours 
enjoying the amenities that this trail offers.
I fully support LD 404 and encourage this bills passage.
