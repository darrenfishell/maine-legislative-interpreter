I’m writing in support of building a bike/pedestrian trail on the existing but currently 
unused rail corridor. I can think of nothing that could do more to revitalize the 
economy of this area as well as provide a much needed place for residents to safely 
recreate.  I believe the creation of a scenic trail connecting Fryeburg to greater 
Portland would truly be transformative for this corner of Maine and make it a 
destination for people who might not otherwise visit our towns. 
And on a personal note, if the trail existed today I’d use it regularly to cycle from my 
home in Brownfield to my shop in Hiram.  I won’t ride a bike on Rt 113 because I 
feel it’s much too dangerous these days.
