LD 404
This pedestrian path would prove to be the most utilized in the entire state of Maine.  
The Portland metro's proximity to the White Mountains has made this corridor the 
most popular weekend vacation route for locals in Northern New England.  In my 
opinion, it is also arguably the most scenic, passing through our beautiful lakes 
region.  
These communities would be connected in new and exciting ways and people who 
live there would experience better real estate values and quality of life.  To use the 
eastern trail as an example: in the town of Scarborough, biking was not feasible.  I 
had never once seen a single rider on the shoulder of Route 1.  Now that there is a 
protected trail, Scarborough has become a destination for people who value the ability
to recreate and commute without danger of high-speed traffic.
I stand in support of the resolution and would be excited to use the trail as soon as it's 
available!
