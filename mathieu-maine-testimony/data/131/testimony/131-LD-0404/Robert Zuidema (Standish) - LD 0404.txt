LD 404
My name is Robert Zuidema. I live in the town of Standish. I am writing in support of
LD 404 Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD1450 to help fund 
building the trail. My wife and I often bike the trail from Standish to Windham and 
the trail in Fryeburg.  
Extending these trails would give the neighboring communities more access to being 
outdoors and exercising.  
This is an investment in Maine communities for generations to come. I love seeing 
people biking, walking, and running on these trails.  These trails are vastly safer than 
bicycling on a highway.  To have a loaded logging truck or any other vehicle 
traveling at 50 to 55 mph pass within 3 to 6 feet of me while riding my bike is a 
terrifying experience. 
It is much safer for people to be on the trails instead of the roads with car and truck 
traffic.  
Please support both LD404 and LD1450. 
Thank you.
