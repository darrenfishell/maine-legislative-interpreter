LD 404
My name is Lynn Tillotson; I live in Saco; I am writing in support of LD 404 to allow
the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the building
of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide 
paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail trail
that already exists in Fryeburg, Gorham, and Windham. 
Thank you,
Lynn Tillotson
