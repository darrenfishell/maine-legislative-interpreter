I do not recommend removal of RR track on Mountain Division track that may be 
needed for defense purposes in the event of war or national crisis. I live on Rt 5 with 
track behind my home that is used by rail fans who removed fallen trees and other 
debri as workers for the state of Maine. there are plenty of walking and riding paths 
only a few miles away in Fryeburg ,Maine. It is a waste of state and federal funds 
which we don't have due to over spending by our government on useless projects like 
this one. Thanks for your consideration.
