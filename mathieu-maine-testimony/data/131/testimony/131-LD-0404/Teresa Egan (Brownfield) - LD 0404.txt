LD 404
I am writing in support of the passage of LD404. I feel that replacing the rails on the 
Mountain Division line with a pedestrian/bikeway is the most exciting transformation 
of that unused asset. It will be a rewarding addition to our town of Brownfield that 
currently does not have any safe space for bike riding, and will have the added benefit
of being a shot in the arm for our economy. Please vote in support of LD404.
