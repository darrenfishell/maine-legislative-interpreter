LD 404
I am writing today in support of both LD404 and LD1450.
I am a 60-year-old Grandpa and am limited in the number of types of exercise that I 
can do. Bike riding is one of my only options. But, as I'm sure you're aware, riding on 
our roads has become increasingly more dangerous. In 2021, twice, I was forced off 
the road and into a ditch by vehicles driven by distracted drivers. Thankfully, I was 
not injured but now I am pretty fearful of exercising my right to use our streets. The 
mountain division Trail provides me with a perfect option. The surface allows me to 
ride safely and I often bring my grandson or wife to ride with me. 
If it were longer I would not have to return so quickly. I am able to pedal longer 
distances but unless it is extended I am confined to riding the same stretch over and 
over again.
Please move to bring this proposal closer to becoming reality.
