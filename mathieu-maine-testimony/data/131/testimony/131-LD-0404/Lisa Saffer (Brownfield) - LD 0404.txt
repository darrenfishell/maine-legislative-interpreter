LD 404
My name is Lisa Saffer, I live in Brownfield, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be accessible to people 
of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain 
Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. I and 
many people I know would use it, and I think it would become a real draw for tourism
in the area. Commercial rail transport is a long way from returning, if ever, and this 
would be an excellent use of the infrastructure.
