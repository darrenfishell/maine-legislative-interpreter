Karen & Perry Glidden
Standish
LD 404
My husband, Perry and I (Karen) Glidden, live on the Old Standish Road, Standish 
and have enjoyed the Sebago to the Sea Trail and other trail networks in our area. We 
are writing in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a
trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. This is a great opportunity for 
all surrounding communities to have use of this extended trail network. Please 
consider extending it. Thank you!
