LD 404
My name is Nathan Burnett, I live in Hiram, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail. 
We have a resource that is doing nothing, and the projections about its previous use 
becoming needed again are limited at best, and would involve serious investment 
even if it were to become viable to use the rail again. The best use for the state-owned
Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, 
which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will 
connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg 
and in Gorham and Windham.
