Daniel Hester
Hiram
LD 404
My name is Daniel Hester, I live in Hiram, am I am writing in support of both LD 404
and LD 1450 to allow development of the trail and to help with necessary funding. I 
have already submitted testimony, but the listing did not indicate that I wish to speak 
by Zoom. Trying again.
The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a paved trail for 
walkers, bikers,  runners, and families which will be accessible to people of all ages 
and abilities. In addition to the opportunities for recreation and active transportation 
that this magnificent trail will provide for our residents, this extensive trail will attract
many visitors and will become a very significant economic boost to communities.  
Please make the Mountain Division become useful again!
Sincerely,
-Dan Hester
