Dear Senator Ben Chipman and Representative Lynn Williams and other Members 
of the Committee. 
  
My name is Richard Rudolph.  I am a Portland resident who has served as the chair 
of Amtrak ’s National Customer Advisory Committee, and currently serve on the 
Maine Rail Group's Board of Directors and chair the Rail Users Network which 
represents long distance, commuter and transit rail riders all across America.   I 
also serve on the “Lower Road Rail Use Advisory Committee. ” 
 
 
I’m opposed to LD404, An Act to Direct the Department of Transportation to 
Implement the recommendations of the Mountain Division Rail Use Advisory 
Committee.”   There seems to be a mad rush to tear up the state-owned railways 
and convert them into bicycle / walking paths without first analyzing how restoring 
these lines could enhance the mobility of citizens interior Maine and support new 
economic development for Maine businesses. 
  
Having lived in Steep Falls, Maine for over twenty three years,  I have first hand 
knowledge why it would be a horrible mistake to tear up the tracks from Standish 
to Fryeburgh, Maine. I attended a number of meetings that were sponsored by town 
officials and the Greater Portland Council of Government during the past two 
decades where town officials and business people expressed interest in restoring 
freight rail service along the line to transport cement, lumber,  fuel pellets, 
aggregates and other fuels.  There was also interest in restoring seasonal passenger 
rail service to take tourists especially cruise ship visitors on the Mountain Division 
line who would enjoy spending time in a more rural area of the state.  
 
I am also concerned about the process used to reach the decision to tear up the 
Mountain Division Line for a bicycle/walking path.  Thank you for your time and 
attention to this urgent matter. 
 
   
 
I currently serve on the “Lower Road” Rail Use Advisory Committee (RUAC)  as 
the only rail advocate and have seen first hand how MEDOT has created stacked 
decks to insure that the state own rail lines will be turned over to the bicycle 
interests.  The consultant hired  by DOT to provide an  economic analysis for the 
state owned  rail lines  which the Maine State Legislature had voted to purchase 
back in the late 1980’s also leaves much to be desired.  The consultants believe 
that people walking and riding bikes will spend much more money than those who 
might utilize the state owned rail lines if they were restored.  On several occasions 
I have actually ridden on the four mile walking / bicycle rail/trail which was built 
during the last decade in Fryeburg, Maine.  My wife and I spent less than $6 
dollars to purchase sodas and candy bars on our way there.   
 
The work that was done to create a trail along the rail line in Fryeburg serves as an 
excellent example of what can be done elsewhere on the Mountain Division Line 
since 85% of the line can easily accommodate a trail along the existing rail line.   
 
 
Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. 
  
Sincerely, 
  
Richard Rudolph, Ph.D.

In closing, LD404 ought not to pass and LD 1450 should be modified to fund rail 
WITH trail only where possible.  No rail infrastructure should be removed or 
altered.
