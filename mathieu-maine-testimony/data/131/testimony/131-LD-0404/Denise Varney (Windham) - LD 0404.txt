LD 404
My name is Denise Varney, I live in Windham, I am writing in support of LD 404 to 
allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trial & LD 1450 to help fund the 
building of the trail.  The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners. accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities .  This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham.
Thank you.
Denise Varney
