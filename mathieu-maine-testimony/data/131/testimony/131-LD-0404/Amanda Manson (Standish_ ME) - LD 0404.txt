LD 404
My name is Amanda Manson and I live in Standish, Maine. I am writing in support of
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to 
help fund the new trail. The best use of the state owned mountain division corridor is 
a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers and runners. Having two kids who love the 
outdoors and exercise, this trail would greatly benefit our family. 
Thank you, Amanda
