LD 404
My name is Jane Bennett, I live in Gorham Maine, I am writing in support of LD 404 
to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 1450 to help fund the
building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a 
wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, accessible to people of all ages and 
abilities. This trail extension will connect to the highly used Mountain Division 
rail-trail that already exists in Gorham and Windham. My husband and I use the MDT
weekly and another stretch to Westbrook and even inland to Fryburg some day would 
be fantastic. We are seniors and bike a lot for our health and enjoyment. 
Thank you,
Jane Bennett
