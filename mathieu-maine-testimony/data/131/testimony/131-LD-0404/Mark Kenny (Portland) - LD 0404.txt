I urge you to implement the recommendations of the Mountain Division Advisory 
Council! Maine needs many more bicycle and walking trails and this corridor is 
already complete in several key areas. Connecting Standish to Fryeburg and 
eventually Portland to Fryeburg is a low cost way to encourage positive outdoor 
recreation and will undoubtably open the towns along the route to low impact tourism
and the dollars that go along with it. Itâ€™s the right thing to do for the future of Maine 
Citizens.  I look forward to businesses such as bike rentals, cafes, restaurants, camp 
grounds and many others in Western Maine benefitting from this smart initiative. 
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mark Kenny
