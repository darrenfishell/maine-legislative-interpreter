LD 404
I write today in support of LD 404. The Mountain Division Trail crosses my driveway
in Windham and is a wonderful asset in the region. I use various parts of it frequently,
as do many other walkers, runners, bicyclists, families, dog owners, skateboarders, 
and, in winter, skiers and snowmobilers.
I have been involved with the trail since Alix Hopkins led the effort for the State to 
acquire the right of way in the 1990s. This bill is consistent with the original vision 
for having the trail extend all the way to the New Hampshire border in Fryeburg.
I am also entirely in favor of having the trail replace the tracks. This makes complete 
sense for a few reasons:
The tracks no longer serve a purpose and show no prospects for being revitalized.
This is the most expedient way to build the trail.
This is the least expensive way to build the trail.
Thank you,
Will Plumley
