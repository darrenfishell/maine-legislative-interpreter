I Casey johnson of Brownfield Maine do solemnly swear that my family, friends and I
would like to travel safely from the Mtns to the coast on a designated non motorized 
path. My friends and I have traveled this path before and all agree that it is in 
desperate need of improvement and safety features for crossings. The path offers great
scenic overlooks that would promote health, and fitness. Maine is a beautiful state that
could boast yet again another reason to vacation
