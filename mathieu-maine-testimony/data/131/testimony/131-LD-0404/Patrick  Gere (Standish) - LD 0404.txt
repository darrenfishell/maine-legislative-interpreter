Hello members of the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation,
My name is Patrick Gere and I live two miles from the proposed Mountain Division 
rail trail in Standish. I strongly support the conversion of the aged rail line 
infrastructure to a public trail system. You must consider the location of the rail line 
to the public drinking water source for 11 communities when discussing this bill. The 
recent headlines of train derailments and associated hazardous waste spills provides 
substantial risk to reactivating the line. The best use for the Mountain Division Trail is
a public way that will provide civic space for community members to interact and will
not impact the water quality for the Greater Portland area.
I urge you to pass this bill.
Thank you,
Patrick Gere
