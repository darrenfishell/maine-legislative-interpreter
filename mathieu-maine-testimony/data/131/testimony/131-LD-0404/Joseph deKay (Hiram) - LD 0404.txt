LD 404
As a resident of Hiram in Oxford County since 1981, I express support of LD 404.  
Our area will benefit from outdoor public recreation opportunities which taking the 
railroad trail, upgrading it for quiet exercise, and enjoyment during warmer weather 
and snowmobiling when weather permits.  In other areas of Maine and the rest of the 
country, this type of effort has proven beneficial.  As a town we held a public meeting
to discuss the matter, and the vast majority are supportive.  Please pass this legislation
for our sake.
