LD 404
My name is Kristen Guffey, I own Guffs Grub and Pub in Standish ME, a small 
restaurant business. I am writing in support of LD 404 & LD 1450. This trail being 
presented would bring lots of business to my restaurant and to other surrounding 
businesses. It would be a good thing for the town of Standish and surrounding towns.
I urge you to vote to Pass.
Thank you,
Kristen Guffey
