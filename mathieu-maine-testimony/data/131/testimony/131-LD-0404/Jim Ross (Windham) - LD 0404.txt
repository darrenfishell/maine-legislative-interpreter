Hello,
I am writing to support the expansion of the Mountain Division Trail, both from 
Windham to Westbrook and from Standish to Fryeburg. I have been a regular user of 
the existing section for many years. As a cyclist, it's  great to be able to ride and not 
have to be concerned about distracted drivers. The only problem is that if I want to 
ride further I need to go back on the (much less safe) roads. I would love to be able to 
ride all day safely and away from noise.
I think a lot of people probably think as I do, and a trail that extended from 
Westbrook to Fryeburg would be a real draw, bringing tourists to the area. There just 
aren't many similar length off-road paved trails anywhere. It would really put Maine 
on the map in the cycling world.
Thanks for your consideration.
