Hello, as a resident of Standish in rural Maine and a parent, I believe access and 
maintenance of natural spaces is critical to community health. Allowing for citizens to
be present in the out of doors and experience the wonders Maine nature can provide is
a critical component of this states native value. 
I believe the provision of this trail system will only have a beneficial impact on the 
state and the communities it transects and while transportation and rail system have 
there own critical value, there is no obvious or immediate need for such a system 
currently. 
I am for the implementation of this rail systems use as a trail.
