I am a member of the Mount Washington Valley Bicycle Club.  We often cycle the 
Fryeburg section of the Maine Mountain Division Rail Trial.  We would love to be 
able to cycle further on this trail.  It is free of motorized traffic and safe. Extending 
this trail makes sense.  The railroad no longer runs on these abandoned tracks.
