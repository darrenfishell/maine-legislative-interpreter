Patricia  Jackson 
Narberth 
LD 404
My name is Patricia Jackson, and I live in Narberth, Pennsylvania. I am writing in 
support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail. The best
use for the state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved Trail for walkers, 
bikers, and runners which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This 
Trail extension will connect to the nine miles of mountain division rail-trail that 
already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham.
Why you may wonder would I care about this? I have family who live in Brownfield 
and I visit them often. Whenever I do my bike comes out of my car, and I use that 
trail often, which is such a tonic for me and, remotely, for those who enjoy the photos 
I take along that trail and post on Facebook, which are many.
Please make this happen.
