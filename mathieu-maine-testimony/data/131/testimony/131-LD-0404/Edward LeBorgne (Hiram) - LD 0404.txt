I need to get out to ride my bike. With the roads around here not having any 
shoulders, it is very unsafe for anyone to ride bikes. We have ridden the Downeast 
Sunrise Trail and it is a great place for all to enjoy and feel safe. Since the trains 
probably will not operate here, it would be a great opportunity for all to benefit from 
this rails to trails. It would promote tourism and bring opportunities for small 
businesses to benefit in this rural area.
