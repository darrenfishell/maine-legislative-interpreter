Hi Justine: I got this text. Would u enter into the record. Thanks, Lynne 
“Morning Lynne, obviously we have never met, but I understand you are on the transportation committee. I am 
strongly opposed to removing rail infrastructure and use of ROW for trail advocates without a very thorough 
analysis of future transportation possibilities. Ruac process was a predetermined sham and an embarrassment 
for DOT. They should know better. The taking of a right of way built for rail is a selﬁsh grab by a special 
interest group serving a fraction of the population. That is a “taking” , a theft. Time and money should be spent 
for rail accommodating trail where possible. Thanks for your time, John Koons, Waterville“
