Gorham - Orchard Ridge Farm
LD 404
My name is Erica Gottshalk, I live in Gorham, ME. I am the owner of Orchard Ridge 
Farm on rt 237. The trail positively impacts my business as well as the community. I 
am writing in support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a
trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use for the 
state-owned Mountain Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and 
runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail 
extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists
in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Erica
