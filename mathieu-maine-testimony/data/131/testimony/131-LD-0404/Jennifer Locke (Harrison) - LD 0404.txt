LD 404
My name is Jennifer Locke.  I live in Harrison ME.  I am writing in support of LD  
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail.  The best use for the 
state-owned Mountain Division Corridor is a wide, paved trail for walkers, bikers and 
runners which would be accessible and safe to people of all ages and abilities. This 
trail extension will connect to the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already 
exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham.  Here families and individuals can 
explore the landscape of Maine without without blocking roadways and dangers of 
traffic.  I know if this happens, I would enjoy adventures on these trails with family 
and friends.  Thank you.
