As a frequent biker in the Portland area this expansion would allow safer and more 
enjoyable options for riding past the end of the current rail trail, as I typically switch 
to roads and continue near the proposed expansion. This type of infrastructure allows 
safe space for recreation and transportation for all and I would love to see an increase 
in opportunities for all to get outside in an environment that is far less intimidating 
than either a dirt trail or busy road.
