The existing portions of the Mountain Division Trail are well used and it would be 
tremendously beneficial to our town of Brownfield and all other towns along the 
corridor to have this trail continued from Fryeburg to Portland.  Right now, there is no
safe place to ride a bike or to walk safely for any distance. It has been proven that 
converted rail trails also bring economic benefits to those towns that are fortunate 
enough to have them. There are also health benefits for individuals of all ages and all 
capabilities - year round. It is not feasible to build a trail alongside the rail, so please 
vote FOR the recommendation to remove the rails and create a paved trail for the 
citizens of Western Maine as well as the visitors who will be drawn to the area for 
biking adventures.
