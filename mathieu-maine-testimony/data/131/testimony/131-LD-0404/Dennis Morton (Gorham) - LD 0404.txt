I am in favor of the conversion of the Mountain Division Rail to a multi use trail. The 
existing MDT attracts hundreds of people now, the use of this trail continues to grow. 
By extending the trail it will become a destination point for many more people 
looking to enjoy biking, walking and jogging. People will be able to bike to 
businesses in both Westbrook and Portland. 
Biking from Fryeburg to Portland will become a reality. A great boom for business 
along the corridor.
Respectfully 
Dennis Morton
