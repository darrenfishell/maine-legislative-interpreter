I am in Scotland on a tour.  Like Maine Scotland receives many tourists to remote 
areas.  Unlike Maine the have Passenger trais AND bike trails.  The trains are filled 
with tourists, local residents, backpakers, and a few bicycles.  The bicycle trails 
except in the city were empty, despite dry and pleasant temperatures.  Why would 
Maine waste a valuable resource of a rail corridor for a little used bike trail when we 
all know Maine'a winters are not conducive to bicycling long distances.  Keep the 
rails, add bike lanes to roads.  Let's make Maine green
