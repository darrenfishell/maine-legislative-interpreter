I would rather not have this section of the old mountain division line tore up. What 
better way with the way fuel prices are in getting to Portland to North Conway and 
not worry about getting stuck in  summer traffic in North Conway. Also doing freight 
service again, I know of at least 3-4 businesses that would use the service if it was 
active again. I think if Conway scenic railroad was ask they could do this service.
