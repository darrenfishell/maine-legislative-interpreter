Having access to public spaces for recreating is critical to the continued health and 
wellness of both our community and also its environs. The expanded rail trail will 
transform a space that has long been dormant into a corridor that will connect people 
from one area to another, encouraging alternative forms of transportation (diverting 
away from car traffic) as well as providing opportunities for safe, outdoor recreation. 
At present, biking on roads shared with cars can deter people from getting on their 
bikes and increases the dangers associated with bike recreation. Such a protected 
space would address these concerns and get more people outside in ways that are 
beneficial to them, the community, and the environment!
