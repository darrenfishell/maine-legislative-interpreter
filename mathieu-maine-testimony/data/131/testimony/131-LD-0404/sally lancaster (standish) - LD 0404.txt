it is very important that this rail trail be completed.  I am 76 and ride my bike and it is
now to dangerous to ride on the main roads, due to distracted drivers, etc.  I have 
recently nearly gotten hit by a car several times on route 114.  I cannot ride on the 
roads anymore due to the danger.  This trail would be such a good addition for bikers 
and walkers, etc.  
Please help us stay safe and continue to exercise, which is what we all need to keep 
healthy and safe.
the trail is a pretty trail and would be a delight for future generations.
Thanks so much
