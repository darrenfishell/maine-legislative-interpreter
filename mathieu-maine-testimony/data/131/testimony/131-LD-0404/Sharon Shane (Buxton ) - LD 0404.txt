I am a senior citizen in the town of Buxton. The Mountain Division Trails are my 
favorite walking trails. I walk four to six miles per day in good weather. I use these 
trails because they are safe, well maintained and I meet lot of nice people and so I 
also get to interact socially which is very important to me since I live alone. I also 
walk these trails with my grandchildren and great grandchildren, which is a wonderful
and healthy way to have family time.
