LD 404
My name is Cassandra Dove PhD], I live in West Baldwin, Maine I am writing in 
support of LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail & LD 
1450 to help fund the building of the trail. The best use for the state-owned Mountain 
Division corridor is a wide paved trail for walkers, bikers, and runners, which will be 
accessible to people of all ages and abilities. This trail extension will connect to the 9 
miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham 
and Windham. 
Thank you,
