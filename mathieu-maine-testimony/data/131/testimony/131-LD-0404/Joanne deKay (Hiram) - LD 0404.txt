LD 404
My name is Joanne Taylor deKay. I live in Hiram, Maine. I am writing in support of 
LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and in support of 
LD 1450 to help fund the construction of the trail. I cannot think of a better use for the
state-owned Mountain Division corridor than a wide, paved trail with open access for 
people of all ages and abilities to walk, bike, and run. This trail extension will form 
community connections via the 9 miles of Mountain Division rail-trail that already 
exists in Fryeburg and in Gorham and Windham. 
Thank you,
Joanne Taylor deKay
