I would like to have a safe place nearby to walk my dogs, and have a safe place for 
others in my family as well, to walk and to bike.
We have no sidewalks anywhere in the immediate area. The road we live on is 50 
mph speed limit with continual traffic including many, many large trucks with heavy 
loads such as logging trucks, cement trucks, dump trucks, and more. 
We live in a beautiful state where being outdoors is an important part of a healthy and
enjoyable life.
Having a place to safely get exercise and enjoy the seasons is tremendously important
and I would strongly urge that the opportunity to do so would be made available.
