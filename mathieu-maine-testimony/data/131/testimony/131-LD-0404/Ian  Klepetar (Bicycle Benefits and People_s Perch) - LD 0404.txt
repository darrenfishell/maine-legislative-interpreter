Bicycle Benefits and People's Perch

Two years ago, I purchased the historic water tower in East Baldwin, Maine and 
moved to the area.  Within the first week, i began riding to Portland to do work and to
the White Mountains to recreate.  I was soon mortified as to the high risk that one 
must face when traveling the 113 corridor because of the narrow road widths, narrow 
to obsolete shoulders, high vehicular speeds and blind curves.  There is currently no 
safe alternative for those of us who have chosen not to own cars. Moving forward 
with a trail corridor (for transportation and recreation) from Windam/Gorham to 
Fryeburg is a once in a lifetime opportunity that will bring economic, quality of life, 
and health benefits to all of the surrounding areas and residents.  More so, this will be 
one of the most majestic and attractive rail to trail conversions in our 
country....running from the ocean to the mountains...truly spectacular!
