LD 404
Hello, my name is Mallary Walton and I am writing in support of LD 404 the 
Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building 
of the trail. My family lives in Windham just minutes from the Gambo Trail start. We 
regularly use this trail since it is close and convenient for us, but also because we love
that it is a paved clear way to have our walls with a stroller or to bike on. Seeing the 
trail connected through all the towns would be wonderful for all out door enthusiasts. 
Thank you
Mallary Walton
