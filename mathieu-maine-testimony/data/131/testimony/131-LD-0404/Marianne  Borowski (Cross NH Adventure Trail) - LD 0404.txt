Marianne  Borowski
Cross NH Adventure Trail
LD 404
My name is Marianne Borowski, I live in Glen, NH, I am writing in support of LD 
404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to become a trail and LD 1450 to help 
fund the building of the trail. Although I live in NH, I use the Mountain Division Trail
sections in Fryeburg and in Gorham/Windham very often. I have been on the Conway
Rec Path Committee in the past advocating for connection from NH to the western 
end of the rail trail in Fryeburg. This corridor is scenic and will be enjoyed over all 4 
seasons by residents and visitors, bringing opportunities for business development 
along the trail.
Along with being an avid rail trail user, I am the President and Founder of the Cross 
NH Adventure Trail. Along with the Cross Vermont Trail organization, we have 
developed a mostly off-road and rail trail route across northern New England. 
Currently the route ends in Bethel, Maine. We are planning for a link to the Mountain 
Division Trail, that will eventually take this Cross New England route all the way to 
Portland, Maine. In addition, Cross NH Adventure Trail, the Cross Vermont Trail and
the Mountain Division Trail are parts of the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy's "New 
England Rail Trail Network" vision. 
Connectivity is key for success with these routes, so of course I support LD 4040 and 
LD 1450 for the connections!
