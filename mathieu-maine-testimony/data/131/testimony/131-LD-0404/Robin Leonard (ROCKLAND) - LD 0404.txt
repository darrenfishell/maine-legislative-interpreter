LD 404
My name is Robin Leonard and I own a home at 1342 Pequawket Trail in Browfield, 
ME. I am writing to support the LD 404 to allow the Mountain Division corridor to 
become a trail and LD 1450 to help fund the building of the trail for walkers, bikers, 
and runners, which will be accessible to people of all ages and abilities.  I currently 
drive to the trail in Fryeberg and walk it and view the mountains and it's a wonderful 
walk.  I would love to hop on the trail in Brownfield.
Thanks,
Robin Leonard
