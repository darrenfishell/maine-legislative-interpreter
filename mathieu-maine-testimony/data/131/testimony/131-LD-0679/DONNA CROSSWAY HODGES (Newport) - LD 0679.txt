Abandoned and uncared for animals is a large problem that should be looked at more 
closely.  Each community (shelters, ACO, etc) seems to handle these differently.  It is 
abandoned property?  Is it animal abuse?  Is it abandonment?  
Please consider a task force to explore this issue further so that we could have a 
clearly defined statewide approach to this issue.  I would be happy to participate as I 
have had :   tenants abandon animal completely, I have had pregnant cat put outside in
a mobile home park and left behind causing over 37 cats having to be trapped and 
cared for, I have had a dog left in a unit for over 45 days while a tenant was being 
evicted- they moved and left the dog there as the resident and only came every few 
days to feed it and put it out.
This bill doesn't get at the heart of the problem but I would love to see this issue 
explored further.
