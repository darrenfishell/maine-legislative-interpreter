Testimony of ROBERT FISK, JR. 
ln SUPPORT of LD 679 “An Act Regarding Animals Abandoned by Tenants” 
Committee of Judiciary 
March 23, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the 
Committee on Judiciary. My name is Robert Fisk, Jr., l am founder and President 
of l\/laine Friends of Animals, giving Maine animals a voice for over 25 years; we 
are located in Falmouth. Thank you Rep. Dodge for sponsoring this legislation. 
This bill was resultant of a real life situation in which one person took the 
initiative to see a void in the law and made a positive change, and ultimately 
passed an amendment to the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. l am 
pleased that the person responsible for the passage of that legislation in Arizona 
is with us today via Zoom from Phoenix. I will let Meg Epstein tell the very 
interesting story of how this legislation originated, but in essence it provides the 
landlord the ability to save a pet of a incapacitated tenant or one that 
unexpectedly dies.‘ 
Besides the usual tenant information, the landlord shall request the name(s) and 
contact information of a person(s) who is authorized by the tenant to enter the 
dwelling to retrieve the tenant’s pet(s) if the tenant dies or is incapacitated. Once 
the landlord is informed of the emergency or abandonment, he/she shall contact 
the authorized person(s). If the contact person(s) does not respond within 24 
hours, the landlord shall remove the pet(s) to an animal shelter or rescue or to an 
animal control / police officer. That is the essence of the bill that is pretty 
straightforward. 
l will conclude my testimony by noting this was bi-partisan legislation that had 
no hearing opposition, and was passed in the Republican controlled AZ 
legislature. it was endorsed by the Arizona Multi-housing Association and 
numerous animal welfare groups including The Humane Society of the United 
States and the Animal Defense League of Arizona, both of which are here today 
submitting testimony in support of LD 679. Arizona House Bill 2507 bill passed 
under the gavel in the House and the Arizona Senate vote was 30-3. It was 
signed into law April 1, 2021 by then Governor Doug Ducey. LD 679 mirrors the 
Arizona legislation and we hope it meets the same result in Maine. _

Attached to my testimony are two articles about “Mathew’s Law” by The 
National Humane Education Society and Anasazi Animal Clinic in Arizona. 
Not only is LD 679 tonmard looking legislation, it helps break down the barrier 
stemming directly from the ambiguity over animals’ legal status in which the law 
still fails to clearly differentiate animate and inanimate property. This legislation is 
a small step in changing that. 
Thank you for considering my testimony, and l would be happy to answer any 
questions you may have. We urge the committee to vote “Ought to pass” on LD 
679.

New “Matthew’s Law" Protects 
Pets in Arizona

No one wants to think about not being able to be there for a beloved pet. 
However, sometimes unexpected situations arise where someone is no 
longer able to care for their companion animal. l\/laking arrangements ina 
will is a great idea, but it doesn't cover every circumstance. How can pet 
owners ensure that someone they trust will take care of their beloved‘ 
animals if they're no longer able? ,0

meisner-save —victims-pets/4712024001/)of Matthew Meisner. Matthew lived with three belo\ 
senior felines, one of whom was diabetic. Upon Matthew’s death, his family could not get hi: 
cats because animals are deemed “property ” under the law and can only be released after 15° 
days. Thankfully, Matthew’s cats have been nursed back to health because of his family’s 
perseverance and advocating for the law to be changed. 
Under the new law, A.R.S. § 33-137O(E) 
(https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/? 
docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/O1370.htm) states 
that“ ...At the landlord's discretion, the tenants abandoned 
animals may be immediately removed and released toa 
shelter or boarding facility. The landlord shall keep a record of 
the name and location of the shelter or boarding facility to 
which the animal was released. If the landlord does not 
immediately remove and release the abandoned animals toa 
shelter or boarding facility, the landlord shall provide reasonable care for the abandoned anin 
for the period prescribed by subsection F of this section. if the landlord is unable or unwilling 
provide reasonable care to the abandoned animals, the landlord shall notify the county 
enforcement agent as deﬁned in section 1 1-1001 or an animal control ofﬁcer as prescribed ii 
section 9-499.04 of the presence of the tenant’s abandoned animals on the properly to be se 
pursuant to section 13-4281. The landlord is not liable for any actions taken in good faith rela 
to the removal, release, seizure or care of the abandoned animals pursuant to this section." 
Take Action: Arizona residents, please thank Governor Ducey
