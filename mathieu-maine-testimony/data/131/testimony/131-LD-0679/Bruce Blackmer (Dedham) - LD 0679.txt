LD 679 
To Chairpersons Anne Carney, Matt Moonen, and the members of the Judiciary Committee 
0 My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham Maine. 
0 I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and 
Managers Association, GBAOIVIA. 
0 l am also a member of the Legislative Council representing landlords and property 
owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, Portland, South Portland, Lewiston, 
Auburn, and the Bangor areas. - 
0 I support this Bill 100%. l feel it is of the utmost importance that any animal in the 
apartment needs to be documented and an emergency contact person needs to be 
authorized to care for the animal(s) if the tenant is unable to do so. 
0 l discovered a long time ago that it is better for the animal and the landlord to get to 
know each other. In the past, I cared for a tenant's dog when he had to be hospitalized 
overnight. 
0 lf the emergency contact is unable to care for the animals, the animals welfare needs to 
come ﬁrst and animal control or the local animal shelter may need to be involved. 
I As a landlord, I would not feel comfortable giving access to someone's apartment toay 
person not designated in the lease or on the animal agreement. I would not want to be 
responsible for stolen or damaged tenant property. 
0 I am here to ask you to SUPPORT LD 679 
0 Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. l would be happy to answer any 
questions. -
