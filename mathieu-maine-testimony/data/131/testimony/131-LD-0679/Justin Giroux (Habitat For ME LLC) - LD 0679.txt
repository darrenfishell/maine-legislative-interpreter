RE: LD 679 An Act Regarding Animals Abandoned by Tenants  
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,  
I’m writing to oppose LD 679 because as written it is problematic for rental housing providers and delays 
care for animals. I should also mention this bill addresse s a very rare occurrences in our industry as most 
tenants love their pets very much.  
In our pet agreement we ask for emergency contact information and the contact information of the 
veterinarian. I have concerns about the ambiguous language a bout having to keep the emergency 
contact update d. Is the tenant going to be legally responsible for keeping landlords up to date if their 
emergency information should chang e? How often must it be updated?  Is there a penalty on the tenant 
if they don’t com ply with this requirement to keep us updated? What if a tenant sneaks in a pet?   
I have further concerns about how this law will increase damage to our buildings and delay professional 
care for the animals. On  the business side, when a tenant has moved o ut, we need to get our turnover  
crew in the re ASAP to get the unit ready as we are losing money due to vacancy during this time. If an 
emergency contact cannot get there  immediately , we need to be able to get the animal to the local 
shelter and inform the tenant and emergency contact of this. We have crews scheduled for the turnover 
and they cannot work around the abandoned animals.  
This law also concerns  me about how it delays care for the animals . By the time we discover an animal 
who has been abandoned  they could have been without food and water for a while. Additionally, fecal 
matter and urine can destroy a home quickly and provides unsanitary conditions for the animal. Our 
current pet agreement allows us to remove the animal immediately in case  of aban donment. I don’t see 
the benefit  to delay this process.
