Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
Maine has been ranked as the top state in the country for the strongest animal 
protection laws for a third year in a row. Let’s continue this progress by providing 
another level of protection for abandoned or unclaimed animals. 
Animals are still considered property. This means animals can be left unattended for 
days or weeks without water, food, medications, or care should a tenant be unable to 
be located. 
This bill requires tenants to designate an authorized person to retrieve an animal in the
event of a tenant’s death, incapacitation, or abandonment; a reasonable request for 
those who have animal companions that depend on humans for their care. This bill 
also explains when a landlord should release an animal to an animal shelter, animal 
control officer, or police officer.
Domestic and/or companion animals rely on humans for care and protection. Being 
abandoned or unclaimed is certainly not the fault of an animal, and it is up to us to 
offer additional protection in these cases.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
