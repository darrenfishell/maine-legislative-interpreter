Testimony in SUPPORT  
of LD 679, “An Act Regarding Animals Abandoned by Tenants ” 
 
Before the Judiciary Committee  
Presented by  Jayne Winters, South China, ME  
 
March 23, 2023  
 
Senator Carney, Representative  Mooonen , distinguished members of the Judiciary  Committee, 
my name is Jayne Winters. I have lived in Maine all my life and been a pe t owner since 
childhood , from goldfish, mice and gerbils to cats, dogs, and a horse . I am submitting 
comments in SUPPORT  of LD 679, “An Act  Regarding Animals Abandoned by Tenants .”  
 
As noted in the bill ’s text, LD 679 would require that a tenant provide his/her land lord with the 
name and current  contact  information of a designate d person (s) au thorized to enter and 
retrieve any animal (s) from the rental home in the event of the tenant ’s death , incapacitation   
(such as hospitalization  or unexpected absence), or abandonment . In addition, the bill  requires 
a landlor d to surrender said animal(s) to an animal control or police officer sh ould the 
authorized p erson fail to retrieve the animal(s) after notification .  
 
Implementing this legislation, which is based on a 2021 bill passed in Arizona,  seems like a win -
win-win to me. One, it ensures a pet is protected  and properly cared for in an emergency. Two, 
it provides the pet owner peace of mind. Three, it provides the landlord protocol for release or 
surrender  of tenant pets  to appropriate designees or enforcement . 
 
I respectfully urge you to pass LD 679, which would protect tenants, pets, and landlords . Thank 
you for your consideration .
