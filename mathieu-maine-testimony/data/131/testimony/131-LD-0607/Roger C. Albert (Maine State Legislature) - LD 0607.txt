Good afternoon Chairpersons Sen. Chipman and 
Representative Williams and members of the Transportation 
Committee. Welcome to LD607, an explosive subject in 
Northern Aroostook County. Subject matter: The completion of 
Interstate 95, which was part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 
1956. President Eisenhower, who had fought so hard for his 
vision, signed the Act on June 29, 1956, with no fanfare, no 
statement, and no photograph of the moment. 
Despite the lack of ceremony, the 1956 Act resulted in 
landmark changes to the connectivity of highways in the U.S. 
and the way in which those highways are ﬁnanced. Congress 
created today’s Interstate System by expanding the system to 
41,000 miles. The Act called for uniformity of design and signs 
to eliminate surprises that could lead to crashes. An extended 
authorization period was established to add certainty to the 
process to enable States to plan major highway projects to be 
completed over several years. 
Coming back to I95, the original plan was a stretch of 
highway to start in Miami Florida, go along the East Coast and 
end in the St. John Valley, Maine. 67 years later, the St. John 
Valley in Northern Maine is still waiting for the highway! It 
was stopped, for political reasons, in Houlton, 104 miles from its 
ﬁnal destination! I am not going to get into the reasons why, as 
they have been numerous, but, for the sake of Northern Maine, 
this highway needs to be completedll There are a hundred 
2 Frenchville, Grand Esle, Maclawaska.Perl1am., St. Agatha and Van Buren, the unorganized territories of Cross 
Lake Township, i\’Eada\¥asEca Lake Tovmsliip. Sinclair Township and Square Lake 
l’ri1iicLlo: ‘ l lpi
reasons for it NOT to be completed! Report after report tell us 
Why, reasons from: not enough traffic, environmental issues, 
communities not in agreement at where the highway should be 
or not be. After the dust settled, it was decided by the powers 
that be, to end in Houlton. Multiple reasons were given and 
published with talks of seceding from Maine was happening! 
The theory of “having Two Maines” was born! 
After 67 years and multiple exhaustive reports, hopefully, 
we can come to the table and try to talk and take action about the 
completion of I95 from Houlton to the St. John Valley, as 
intended. 
Remember our trip, as a group, to the Maine Turnpike 
Headquarters here in Augusta? Our initial meeting started with 
a video clip that, within l0 seconds after the video started, a 
caption appeared on the screen that said “Thank you for the 
Maine Turnpike for saving our Economy! ” or something to that 
effect. 
Let’s talk a bit about our Aroostook County economy. 
Northern Maine is known for its Agriculture such as potatoes & 
broccoli ﬁelds. It’s also known for its forests and lumber mills. 
But something is happening in Northern Aroostook County. 
There is a company, not known by many because of its 
classiﬁed product that it will test and produce, for the Defense 
Department that will be hiring 3 to 4 hundred employees, it is 
reported. They will developing hyper speed missiles and firing 
them into the Allagash forest in the West of our State!! Asa 
Maine citizen, I couldn’t get any information but as a State of 
Maine Representative, I might. There is also talk of having as 
much as a 6 to 7 thousand increase in population around the
former Loring AFB in Limestone. None of this is set in 
concrete, but talks are moving forward. WE NEEDA 
HIGHWAY THAT I95 CAN AND SHOULD PROVIDE! 
We’ve built highways in Alaska, and through the Yukon! 
Canada built the Trans Canada Highway from the Atlantic to the 
Paciﬁc! Can’t we ﬁnish our I95 to the St. John Valley‘? It’s 
only 120 miles, give or take 10 miles or so! 
The bottom line on this issue is to get both houses of this 
State to pass legislation on this issue in such a way that we can 
send our big OK providing that the Feds pay for 80 to 90% of 
the construction costs of this project. I was told by our MDOT 
observer, in this room, that because this project would cost 1.8 
billion $$$ and they going to ﬁght this, in this committee. Why 
don’t we explore ways to get the major cost of this project paid 
for by the Feds? The leaders of both Houses agree and have 
signed on! We have powerful State of Maine reps in both the 
Federal House and Federal Senate. Susan Collins is today aware 
of our attempts to get this project underway. I have been in 
touch with her ofﬁce and our co-committee member, Rep. 
Austan Theriault brieﬂy spoke to her at the CanAm festivities in 
Fort Kent. She is totally aware of our attempts to ﬁnish this 
project. Need I say that she is also on Appropriations? She isa 
co-chair of that committee. Jared Golden’s ofﬁce has been put 
on notice on our attempt. S0 has Angus King’s ofﬁce. 
If we can get our Legislature, House and Senate, to agree 
on this, we can send a message to Washington D.C. and in time 
for Susan Collins’ Appropriation Committee to take a look at it 
and ﬁnd $$$ for this project, that is close to 70 years old. 
Rep. Roger C. Albert
