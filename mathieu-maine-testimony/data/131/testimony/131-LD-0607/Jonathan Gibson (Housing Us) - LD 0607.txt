 Senator Benjamin Chipman, Chairperson Representative Lynne Williams, Chairperson Joint Committee on Transportation 100 State House Station Augusta, Maine 04333   WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF JONATHAN LEE GIBSON, CEO, HOUSING US, INC  LD 607, HP 0384 Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Examine the Feasibility of Extending Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley   To the Honorable Chairs and Members of the Joint Committee on Transportation:  I am the Chief Executive Officer of Housing Us, Inc., a Delaware Corporation with Authority to do Business in the State of Maine as a Registered Foreign Corporation. Housing Us runs a private equity real estate fund that raises capital to invest in projects across the northeast, and we partner with local municipalities to address housing needs through real estate development.  Over the past year, Housing Us has been working with elected and appointed officials in the town of Presque Isle, Maine to identify opportunities to address the substantial lack of housing for its current population. Presque Isle is facing a future housing crisis as economic development continues to bring new jobs and residents to the area, an area with functionally obsolete existing housing stock and an immediate need for over three-hundred units of housing, based on some reports.  Our development goals in Maine have slowed because of lack of infrastructure. The ability to move materials, including but not limited to prefabricated structures, as well as labor and service providers, is hampered and cost-burdened by a lack of basic highway infrastructure. This factor raises the capital required to complete development projects and, in some cases, may prevent development from occurring at all.  

 
Even after our work is completed, the lack of transportation infrastructure will continue to impact Presque Isle homeowners, unless action is taken. “Inadequate infrastructure creates a hard ceiling to economic development, and real estate values are tied to sustainable growth,” explains Julie Melander, CRE, 2019 chair of The Counselors of Real Estate.1  The reality is that economic development in Aroostook County will continue to stagnate until the movement of goods and services are matched with the basic infrastructure of other areas in Maine.  As a developer working to bring housing and economic opportunity to northern Maine, I fully support the passage of this resolution and believe that the examination of the extension of Interstate 95 by the Transportation Department will show what we all know: the extension of I-95 will have positive impacts for the hardworking people of Aroostook County.  Yours,     Jonathan Lee Gibson                1 http://www.realestateindepth.com/news/inadequate-infrastructure-tops-issues-affecting-real-estate/
