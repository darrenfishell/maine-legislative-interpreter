 
 Rep. Albert and Members of the Transportation Committee,   Thank you for taking the time to discuss LD 607 with me this morning.   This proposal would direct the Department of Transportation to examine the feasibility of extending the I95 corridor into the St. John Valley and northern Maine.   As you know, transportation and logistics in northern Maine can be extremely challenging.  There are limited options available for the movement of the raw materials necessary to support large scale manufacturing operations and for transporting of finished goods to customers across North America.  The road network that does exist often funnels heavy trucks through the smaller communities of Aroostook County which can result in inefficiency of shipping as well as disruption for the local residents.   A modern interstate highway servicing the region would be beneficial to both manufacturers and residents of the region and would improve options for further economic development.    I will look forward to speaking with you again in the near future on other opportunities to support the residents and business community in the St. John Valley.     Kind Regards   Robert B Harvey Chief Operating Officer Twin Rivers Paper Company LLC (O):  207-728-8524 (M):  920-479-8362 robert.harvey@twinriverspaper.com www.twinriverspaper.com
