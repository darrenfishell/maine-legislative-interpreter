Testimony in Support of LD 607 
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Examine the Feasibility of 
Expanding Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley” 
March 14, 2023 
Patrick Strauch, Executive Director 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and members of the Committee 
Transportation, my name is Patrick Straueh and I am here on behalf of the Maine Forest 
Products Council in support of LD 607, “Resolve, to Direct the Department of 
Transportation to Examine the Feasibility of Expanding Interstate 95 to the St. John 
Valley.” 
While we know this issue has been considered previously, we believe a Department review of 
the issue is timely for a few simple reasons: safety and efficiency. When Rt. 9, the road 
connecting Washington County to Bangor, was upgraded and improved, it is said that a half 
hour was shaved off of the time it takes to commute to and from the eastern corner of our state. 
In addition to the time savings, additional lanes increase safety along this route, and the 
investment in facilities has made the overall experience of traveling to and from Bangor more 
enjoyable for commuters and truckeis alike. 
A study will likely ﬁnd that expanding the l~95 corridor to the St. John Valley will have similar 
effects, which could signiﬁcantly improve our ability to transport forest products iiom 
Aroostook County to markets on the eastern seaboard. 
For those reasons, please consider supporting LD 607. 
Thank you.
