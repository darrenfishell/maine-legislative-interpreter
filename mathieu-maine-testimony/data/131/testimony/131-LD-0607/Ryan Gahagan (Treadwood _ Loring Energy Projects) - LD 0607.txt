LD 607
Thank you Chair and Members of the Transportation Committee. I'm submitting this 
testimony in support of LD607 - Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation 
to Examine the Feasibility of Extending Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley. While I 
am excited to see funding has been awarded for the Presque Isle bypass, phase 2 of 3, 
I believe a feasibility study for extending I-95 is worthwhile. I split my time pretty 
evenly between Portland, where I live and work, and the County. My parents are at 
our farm in Castle Hill, we enjoy time at our year-round camp on Long Lake in St. 
Agatha, and I have an office at Loring. I have several energy and infrastructure 
projects in the County and throughout the state and believe this is a worthwhile study 
to undertake. Thank you for your time and consideration.
