   To:  Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and esteemed members     of the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation  Re: I95 proposed extension LD607   I am writing this letter and testifying in support of LD607. Aroostook County is situated in the upper part of Maine. Growing up in this area is one of the best things that has happened to me. However, sadly the distance from Northern Maine to Central Maine is quite long. Living in a rural area has its pros and cons. The way of life being sheltered from high crime rates and noise and the busy life is definitely a pro. The con is that when we need to make a living by working there is very little to find other than the Forestry wood cutting industry. We need to attract more businesses and factories to establish themselves in Aroostook County. One of the major complaints is the distance and the travel. I have been the Ashland Town Manager for some time now and I know when we hear of someone considering establishing a business in the Ashland area, one of the big issues is getting to Ashland. Building an extension to the I95 would be a great help to connect the Northern Aroostook County with central Maine areas. Getting off at the I95 at Sherman Stacyville exit or the Oakfield exit and driving the windy up and down roads. Secondly, dealing with the animals who live in the dense woods of Route 11 is more than a challenge. An extension of the I95 in any Northern direction from Houlton or somewhere in between is a must. Establishing businesses and attracting new residents is one of my main goals as a Town Manager. Tourism in the Aroostook County is also a main attraction this interstate would again allow the county to attract more tourist with a much nicer way of travel to reach beautiful Northern Maine.
