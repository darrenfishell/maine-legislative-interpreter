March 14, 2023 
 
Senator Chipman,  Representative Williams, members of the Committee 
On Transportation,  I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of Maine 
Commu nity Action Partnership and we support LD 607: Resolve, to 
Direct the Department of Transportation to Examine the Feasibility of Extending Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley . 
 
As someone who spent over a year driving from my home in Presque 
Isle to visit my stepchildren in Cape Elizabeth nearly every  weekend, I 
know  how long the drive becomes once you leave the interstate and 
begin to travel on Route 1. The drive is beautiful, and it is slow. 
 
Expansion of I -95 to the northernmost region of the state would be 
especially helpful to economically disadvantaged households who often 
need to travel downstate for medical and other necessary appointments.  Our Community Action Agency serving Aroostook 
County  (ACAP) works with households who turn to them for assistance 
with transportation to medical facilities for cancer and other treatments . 
Our staff and local residents also make that drive regularly . 
 
ACAP also is the provider of WIOA 1-B Workforce Development 
services – and works with job seekers and employers.  As others have 
often said, the extension of the highway and the possibility of bringing 
additional jobs to the region would provide more opportunity for area residents , and that makes this  important  to that work.  This is especially 
true as it relates to the traditional backbone natural product industries that have long been the staple of the Aroostook County economy –  
agriculture and forestry.  
 
A faster, more direct route to the cities in norther Aroostook would open 
up the area to new residents, new jobs and new areas of economic development and mobility. Please su pport the study, then the funding, 
to extent interstate 95 all the way  to end of the state, in the St. John 
Valley.  
 
Thank you for your time and attention.
