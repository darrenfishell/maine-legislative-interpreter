If northern Maine is going to sustain itself and grow, we need more efficient transportation. As a 
business owner and having a young family, I'm invested in the success of Northern Aroostook County 
and the St. John Valley. If businesses in manufacturing, tech, and advanced professional fields are to 
grow or even start, we need to be accessible. The current route is known throughout New England as 
being infamously dangerous, and extending the interstate would not only encourage investment in the 
Valley and Maine but also be a boon to the tourist industry. As an owner of multiple businesses in my 
twenties, I think every day about my next investments. I have always wanted to create a manufacturing 
or production business, but to reach global markets without the interstate creates the uncertainty many 
entrepreneurs struggle with when contemplating investments. If we are to continue our way of life, we 
need to make it easier to get here. Please vote “ought to pass “on LD 607, and help connect us to the 
rest of the State.
