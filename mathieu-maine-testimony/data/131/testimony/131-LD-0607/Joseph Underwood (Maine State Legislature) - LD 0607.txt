Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of the transportation committee 
My name is Joseph Underwood, l am from Presque isle and l proudly serve House District Sin Aroostook 
County. I come to you today urging an "ought to pass" on LD 607. 
There is a 4-lane high way in the area and a person should have a passport to access it. It is the Trans- 
Canada Highway or TCH. 
The connection between the TCH, at Woodstock, New Brunswick, to Houlton is decent. With this 
extension the movement of goods to and from Aroostook County and Maritimes would improve. 
Presque isle is home to an international airport and there are flights to and from New York area every 
day. Many commercial package carriers have a facility in Presque isle and would benefit froma 
connection to the extension. 
Houlton & Madawaska are major entry points for importation of Canadian Products. An extension of 1- 
95 from Houlton to Madawaska would connect the northern end with the southern end of Aroostook 
County and could facilitate the improvement of Aroostook County's economy and tourism industry. 
The Department of Transportation is the right organization to facilitate the feasibility of this resolve. 
Again, I thank thecommittee for hearing my testimony today and urge you to vote â€˜ought to pass" on 
this resolve.
