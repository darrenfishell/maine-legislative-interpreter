The
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
is
the
statewide
organization
that
advocates
for
bicyclists
and 
pedestrians.
We
work
to
make
Maine
better
for
bicycling
and
walking,
and
to
protect
the
safety
and 
rights
of
vulnerable
users
of
the
public
ways.  
As
a
member
of
the
2019
Blue
Ribbon
Commission
on
Transportation
Funding,
I
learned
of
the 
chronic
shortfalls
and
challenges
of
the
MaineDOT’s
budget.
Three
years
later,
the
MaineDOT 
continues
to
struggle
to
fund
all
maintenance
and
new
project
work–and
bike/ped
projects
are 
typically
at
the
end
of
the
line
for
funding
allocations. 
As
a
result,
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
opposes
this
bill.
We
feel
that
Maine’s
taxpayer
dollars 
would
be
better
allocated
supporting
multi-use
projects
that
benefit
a
larger
percentage
of
our
state's 
residents.
Thanks
for
the
opportunity

Testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 607 
“A Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Examine the Feasibility of 
Extending Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley”
My name is James Tassé, and I submit this testimony on behalf of the Bicycle Coalition of Maine 
(BCM) in opposition to LD 607 “A Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Examine 
the Feasibility of Extending Interstate 95 to the St. John Valley.”  We recommend an "Ought Not to 
Pass" vote. 
 
The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is the statewide organization that advocates for bicyclists and 
pedestrians. We work to make Maine better for bicycling and walking, and to protect the 
safety and rights of vulnerable users of the public ways.  
As a member of the 2019 Blue Ribbon Commission on Transportation Funding, I 
learned of the chronic shortfalls and challenges of the MaineDOT’s budget. Three 
years later, the MaineDOT continues to struggle to fund all maintenance and new 
project work–and bike/ped projects are typically at the end of the line for funding 
allocations. 
As a result, the Bicycle Coalition of Maine opposes this bill. We feel that Maine’s 
taxpayer dollars would be better allocated supporting multi-use projects that benefit a 
larger percentage of our state's residents.
