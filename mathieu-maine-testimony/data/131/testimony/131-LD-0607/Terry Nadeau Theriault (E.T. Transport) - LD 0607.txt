The trucking and logging industry is challenged in ways we have not seen in our 36 years in business. We support the North-South Highway because it will do what we all have been trying to do for decades, and that is to make Aroostook competitive on the International stage. Furthermore, we encourage the bill to be honed in to not make this a study but a priority for the State to finalize its plans for the highway in Aroostook.   Millions of dollars of goods leave our area for Canada and the Southern United States every year and with the rising costs of everything, our industry is barely hanging on. Not only do we have the same issues as everyone else in finding people to work, but our costs per mile are substantially higher due to the condition and efficiency of our road system in Northern and Central Maine. We have some small transportation veins coming into Aroostook, but they were built in the early twentieth century.  Our Company has seen the investments going into infrastructure across the border in New Brunswick. Over the past many decades, we have seen Canada make substantial investments in Trans-Canada. Canadian companies are now more efficient and profitable than us in transporting goods. Our next-door neighbors in Edmundston, New Brunswick, right across the border with Madawaska, Maine have experienced a boom in their industries and population. If they understand what an efficient highway system can do to a rural economy, when will we? Northern Maine is a great place to live, and it could be a hub of International travel and trade if we would embrace that investments are needed in the infrastructure and connect the Trans-Canada to the I-95 in the St. John Valley.  Itâ€™s about time, we turn the page from 1950s thinking and connect Northern Maine to the rest of the Country.  Sincerely,  Terry Nadeau Theriault
