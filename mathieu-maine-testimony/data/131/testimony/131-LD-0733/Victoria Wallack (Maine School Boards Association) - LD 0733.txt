 TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 733  
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE AN ANNUAL ITEMIZED STA TEMENT OF  
BENEFITS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND RETIRE ES 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing, I am Victoria Wallack, director of communications and government 
relations for Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of the 
legislative committee of the Maine School Boards Association, neither for nor 
against L.D. 733.  
 
The Maine School Boards Association is neither for nor against this bill because it 
is unnecessary.  
 
This bill requires a public employer to provide to public employees, who are in our 
case teachers and other school staff, a statement that includes wages and benefits. 
That information already is public as part of our contracts. For retirees it is out-
lined as part of the state ’s teacher retirement plan through the Maine Public Em-
ployees Retirement System or MainePERS.  
 
The bill also requires the retirement system to create and display a dashboard for 
members to help calculate their retirement needs. We will leave MainePERS to 
address that part of the bill, but know there are retirement planning seminars listed 
on its website.
