In Opposition to  
LD 733, An Act to Require an Annual Itemized Statement of Benefits for Public Employees and 
Retirees   
 
March 28, 2023  
 
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Labor & Housing 
Committee. My name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony in opposition to LD 733 on 
behalf of the 70 municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Associat ion’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
 It is unclear as to whether this proposal impacts all public employers . If so, m unicipal 
officials oppose the provisions in LD 733 , as a ny employ ee is free to ask a municipal employer  
for detailed  information about the benefits received in the previous year.  The mandate to provide 
the data annually, via electronic means  and the U.S. postal service , will place additional 
pressures on limited  financial resources .  As municipalities and public employers struggle to fill 
vacan cies, m andates of this s ort just exacerbate  the issue and plac e addi tional demands on our 
employees .   
 If the Legislature believes the proposal found in LD 733 is  good public policy, then the 
bill should be amended to require the state to reimburse municipalities for 10 0% of the costs of 
implementation. That said, the members of the policy committee would prefer you exc lude 
municipal  employers from the  mandate.  
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue. If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 592 -4038.
