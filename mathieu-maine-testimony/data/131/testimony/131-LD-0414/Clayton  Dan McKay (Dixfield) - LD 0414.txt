The following information is from docket case # 2023-00023, Notice of Inquiry:
THE HISTORY OF LONG-TERM RENEWABLE CONTRACTS
"In 1997 the Legislature directed the general divesture of generation assets by 
Maine’s investor-owned utilities, P.L. 1997, Chapter 316, “An Act to Restructure the 
State’s Electric Industry” (codified at 35-A M.R.S. § 3204). More recently, however, 
the Legislature has enacted various programs to support the development of 
renewable power which have required: (1) that the Commission procure generation; 
and (2) that the utilities enter into contracts for the purchase of generation facility 
output and then sell or otherwise dispose of that output as directed by the 
Commission. The Commission’s practice over the past several years has been to have 
the utilities sell this generation facility output into the wholesale energy market."  
NOTE: 1) "that the Commission procure generation"
NOTE: 2) "that the utilities enter into contracts for the purchase of generation facility 
output and then sell or otherwise dispose of that output as directed by the 
Commission."
