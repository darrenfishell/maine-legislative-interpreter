Public Utility Customers ” 
Senator Mark Lawrence 
Presented to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
March 2, 2023 
Good afternoon, Representative Zeigler and Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. I am Senator Mark Lawrence and I represent 
Senate District 35, which is made up of Eliot, Kittery, Ogunquit; South Berwick, and York. I am 
here today to present LD 414, “An Act to Clarify the Provision of Notice of Proposed Rate 
Increases to Public Utility Customers. ” 
Our constituents have been on the receiving end of non-transparent rate increases for too long. 
This legislation will hold utilities accountable, and keep the rate increase process more 
transparent, giving more customer ’s appropriate notice prior to a rate increase. 
This bill requires a public utility seeking an increase in rates greater than 1% to send a notice of 
increase to their customers and prescribe details for that notice. The bill also prohibits the Public 
Utilities Commission from approving an increase in rates greater than the increase described in 
the notice sent to customers. 
I thank you for your time and consideration. I ask that you direct your questions to Ben Frech 
from the Ofﬁce of the Public Advocate.
