TESTIMONY OF SUSAN MORRISON  IN SUPPORT:  Transportation Bond LD 367   Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 131st Maine Legislature  Thursday, April 27, 2023  Good afternoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs. My name is Susan Morrison, I am a resident of Scarborough, and I am one of the owners of CPM Constructors, a bridge and heavy construction company, employing more than 100 Maine people, based in Freeport. I am currently serving as a Director on the Maine Better Transportation Association board. I am submitting my testimony in support of LD 367.  This bond will aid the state in funding the repair and maintenance of Maine’s aging infrastructure. In 2022, A report released by TRIP, a national transportation research nonprofit in Washington, D.C., found that 15% of Maine’s rural bridges are in poor and structurally deficient condition. Through our own work on Maine’s bridges, we can confirm the concerning condition of the roads and bridges transporting the people of Maine daily.  The harsh winter weather conditions we experience aid in the deterioration of our roads, bridges, and railways more quickly than other climates. We must proactively fully fund maintenance, repairs, and replacement of our infrastructure to ensure safety for the traveling public. It makes sense to use bonds to secure additional matching federal, local, and private funds.  There are lines to be painted, roads to be paved, and bridges to be rehabilitated or replaced. Prices for materials to complete these projects have increased dramatically over the past two years, and they are still escalating. Unfortunately, the aging infrastructure issues we are looking at as an industry cannot be kicked down the road, safety will not allow it.  I ask you to support LD 367 to improve public safety and to maximize available federal funds. Thank you for your time.
