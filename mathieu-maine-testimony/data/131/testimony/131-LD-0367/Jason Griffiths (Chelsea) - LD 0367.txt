LD 367
Senator Rotundo and Representative Sachs,
 
I am asking for you to support LD 367.  
Maine needs a Transportation Bond for many reasons, here are just a few below:
 
1. Bond funds are routinely used to match federal, local, and private dollars, not only 
for highways and bridges, but also airports, transit, marine and rail facilities. (60 to 
70% supported by Maine Voters)
2.  Bonds improve public safety.  In October 2022, TRIP, a national transportation 
research nonprofit in Washington, DC, found that 15% of Maineâ€™s rural bridges are in
poor and structurally deficient condition, the sixth highest rate in the country. Maine's
rural roads and bridges among the worst in the US. (Several News pieces have been 
directly towards poorly maintained roads and the inherent costs absorbed by Maine 
Residents to repair their vehicles.)
3.  Bond is Multimodal and provides funding for every mode. $1 billion of federal 
highway investment supports 34,779 jobs. Maine industries like tourism, forestry, 
agriculture, manufacturing, and they are depending on our system. 
4. We cannot be in a position to not leverage the federal highway funds to reinvest 
into our State. By missing this opportunity, we are making a huge mistake for not 
only the short term but also for the long term. How much longer can we go 
recognizing we have a shortfall in funding for our State's infrastructure and not move 
to action to close the gap.
Sincerly,
Jason Griffiths
