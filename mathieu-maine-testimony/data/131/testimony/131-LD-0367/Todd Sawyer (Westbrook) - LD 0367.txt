LD 367
Senator Rotundo and Representative Sachs,
I am asking for you to support LD 367.  Maine needs a Transportation Bond for many
reasons:
1. Bond funds are routinely used to match federal, local, and private dollars, not only 
for highways and bridges, but also airports, transit, marine and rail facilities.
2.Bonds improve public safety.  In October 2022, TRIP, a national transportation 
research nonprofit in Washington, DC, found that 15% of Maineâ€™s rural bridges are in
poor and structurally deficient condition, the sixth highest rate in the country. Maine's
rural roads and bridges among the worst in the US
3.  Bond is Multimodal and provides funding for every mode. $1 billion of federal 
highway investment supports 34,779 jobs. Maine industries like tourism, forestry, 
agriculture, manufacturing, and serves are depending on our system. 
Again, please support LD 367.
