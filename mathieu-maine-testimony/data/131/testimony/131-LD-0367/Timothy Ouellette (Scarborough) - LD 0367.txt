TESTIMONY OF TIMOTHY OUELLETTE 
 IN SUPPORT: 
 
Transportation Bond 
LD 367  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs 
131st Maine Legislature 
 
Thursday, April 27, 2023 
 
Good afternoon, Senator Rotundo, Representative Sachs and distinguished members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs. My name is 
Tim Ouellette, I live in Scarborough, and I am one of the owners of CPM 
Constructors, a bridge and heavy construction company based in Freeport. In the past 
I served as the 2015 Board President for AGC Maine, an association representing over 
250 construction firms and thousands of construction workers across Maine, and 
currently still serve on the association’s board. I am submitting my testimony in 
support of this bond. 
 
Without this proposed bonding, the Department of Transportation’s program for 
maintaining Maine’s bridges, roads, rail systems and port facilities is insufficient to 
address the infrastructure needs of the state.  
 
CPM Constructors currently employs over 100 Maine people on transportation and 
multimodal projects across the state. These working people are always concerned 
about their employment future, and knowing there is a bond available to provide 
construction jobs for the next few years gives them the drive and motivation to stay in 
Maine, pay taxes and contribute to our state.  
 
Additionally, the construction industry is short of skilled workers in the trades, and 
short of engineers to plan and oversee much-needed construction work.  Young people 
considering the skilled trades or engineering careers will see a commitment from us 
all to invest in the roads and bridges we use every day. This will keep their interest 
alive in such a career choice, and hopefully keep them in Maine.  
 
To keep Maine’s infrastructure strong and maintain a skilled and capable taxpaying 
workforce, I encourage you to support LD 367. Thank you for your time.
