LD 1433
LD 1433 An Act to Exclude Pegmatites from the Definition of “Metallic Mineral” 
ought not to pass
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and the Committee on Environment and 
Natural Resources my name is Arleigh Kraus I am a registered cannabis caregiver 
with a B.S. in biochemistry, an organic farmer, and business owner in Warren. I am a 
board member of Maine based Citizens against Residential Mining Activities 
(CARMA) and a concerned citizen scientist.
I am testifying today in opposition to LD1433.  This bill is in direct conflict with the 
protection of human and environmental health by allowing for unregulated mining in 
Maine.
I urge ought not to pass LD1433.
