Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1433:
“An
Act
to
Exclude
Pegmatites
from
the
Definition
of
"Metallic
Mineral”
Senator
Brenner,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Environment
and
Natural
Resources,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1433
.
We
have
been
open
about
our
desire
to
see
this
circular
definition
of
“metallic
mineral”
changed
in
order
to
allow
for
economically
feasible
extraction
of
the
impressive
lithium
deposit
at
Plumbago
Mountain
in
Newry.
A
review
of
testimony
previously
submitted
provides
a
frame
for
the
debate
around
making
this
small,
but
significant
change
in
state
law.
The
Maine
Forest
Products
Council
is
urging
the
state
to
“allow
crushing,
sorting
and
grinding
of
rocks
containing
lithium
under
the
rock
quarry
regulations
while
continuing
to
regulate
the
chemical
processing
of
lithium
under
the
mining
law,”
noting
that
“these
two
processes
are
vastly
different
with
different
risk
profiles.”

Maine
Department
of
Environmental
Protection
(DEP),
in
its
testimony
noted
that
it
preferred
to
avoid
specific
types
of
rock
in
the
definition
of
“metallic
mineral,”
because
“exempting
a
particular
type
of
rock
from
the
Mining
Act
exempts
all
activities
with
that
rock.”
DEP
signaled
its
desire
for
“narrower,
specific
exemptions
for
lower
risk
activities.”

A
possible
compromise
of
these
two
perspectives
could
be
to
specify
the
processes—instead
of
rock
being
processed—which
would
constitute
metallic
mineral
mining
versus
quarrying.
Though,
the
mining
industry
seems
to
regard
granitic
pegmatites
as
a
rock
which
would
call
for
quarrying
activities
anyway,
and
not
akin
to
metallic
mineral
mining.
Including
the
type
of
rock
in
the
definition
works
because
that
type
of
rock
is
not
environmentally
dangerous
to
extract.

is
not
opinion;

(USGS)
has
stated
many
times
over
the
years
that
quarrying
granitic
pegmatites
pose
very
low
environmental
risks.

There
is
no
reason
Maine
law
should
be
more
strict
than
USGS
standards.
The
bottom
line
is
that
the
2017
reforms
of
the
mining
law
simply
went
too
far.
This
is
the
opportunity
to
reign
in
a
particularly
absurd
aspect
which
is
unnecessarily
holding
back
Mainers
from
earning
a
proper
wage
and
contributing
to
the
Mills
administration’s
ambitious
electric
vehicle
goals,
of
which
only
4%
has
been
met
so
far.

Please
deem
LD
1433
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
make
this
small
definitional
change
to
the
law
and
promote
environmentally-sound
economic
development
in
western
and
northern
Maine.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
