Testimony of Steve Lyons 
Neither for nor against LD 807 
An Act to Create the Small Communities Tourism Fund 
Good Afternoon Senator Curry, Representative Roberts, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. 
My name is Steve Lyons. I am the director of the Maine Office of Tourism, an office of the 
Department of Economic and Community Development. 
Thank you for the opportunity to share information about the Maine Tourism Marketing 
Partnership Program, which provides grant funding support to regional, organizational and 
community tourism projects. 
The Maine Tourism Marketing Partnership Program was created to assist with the 
implementation of marketing programs that are designed to stimulate and expand Maine’s travel 
and tourism economy by coordinating the promotional efforts of the private sector with those of 
the Maine Office of Tourism and its eight designated tourism regions. 
The program is comprised of the Maine Communities Grant Program, Special Event Marketing 
and Tourism Enterprise Marketing grants, and Regional Grants. For today’s testimony, I will 
focus on the Maine Communities Grant and the Special Event/Enterprise Marketing Grants. 
In 2018, the Office of Tourism introduced the Maine Communities Grant to support tourism 
focused, community-oriented marketing projects and events. In the past 5 years, the Office of 
Tourism has awarded $36,472 in Maine Communities Grants of up to $2500 each. 
In 2023, the award has been increased to a $5,000 maximum. In the past, this grant program has 
never been oversubscribed, but to accommodate the larger award maximum, we have budgeted 
$50,000 for the upcoming 2024 Fiscal Year. 
Some of the programs or organizations that have taken advantage of this program include: The 
Town of Gray Blueberry Festival, Denmark Arts Center, Eastport Area Chamber of Commerce, 
Presque Isle Community Development Association and the Wild Bluebeny Heritage Center and 
Museum in Columbia Falls and the Camden Garden Club. 
As community events grow, communities can apply for larger grants through the Enterprise 
Marketing Grant Program (Maximum amount of $30,000) or Special Events Grant Program 
($30,000 — $60,000).

In addition to the Maine Tourism Marketing Partners Program, the Office of Tourism Works with 
communities to offer technical assistance on destination development through the Community 
Destination Academy —or CDA program. This program is funded by the Office of Tourism and 
it brings community members together to develop a tourism strategy. The goal is to help rural 
communities develop a vision to promote tourism at the level that Works best for them. 
We are currently facilitating a CDA for the “Way DoWneast ” communities of Calais, Eastport, 
Lubec and Machias. 
In recent years, the Community Destination Academy program has helped launch on-going 
destination development plans in the Moosehead Lake, Rangeley Lake, and the Mahoosucs 
(B ethel) regions. 
This concludes my testimony, and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
