In Support of LD 539
An Act to Provide Substance Use Disorder Counseling for MaineCare Members with 
Acquired Brain Injury
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services:
I urge the legislature to pass LD539. This is a common-sense bill. As an advocate 
regarding brain injuries in the state of Maine, I have seen first hand, the intersection 
of substance use and acquired brain injury. The early promise of narcotic overdose 
recoveries with Narcan sprays has been accompanied by the understanding that the 
recoveries may come with significant brain injuries. This bill will provide counselling
services to MaineCare recipients concerning SUD and it is another piece of the puzzle
of reducing and addressing the incidence of SUD/Brain Injury.
