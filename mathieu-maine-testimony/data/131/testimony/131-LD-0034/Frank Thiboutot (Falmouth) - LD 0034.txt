LD 34
I am urging the passage of LD 34 for the following reasons:
* It helps insure the much needed integrity and confidence in our valued election process;
* Everyone who is eligible to vote should be assured that his vote is counted fairly and not 
negated by fraudulent votes cast by ineligible or imaginary persons;
* Evidence from numerous studies prove that being required to provide an ID is not financially
burdensome nor does it depress the voter turnout of minorities, the poor, the disabled or the 
elderly.  
If legal photo IDs are required for a myriad of transactions, they should be required to vote 
which is considered a sacred right of all American citizens. All arguments against it are not 
only just specious but are blatantly and patently false.
