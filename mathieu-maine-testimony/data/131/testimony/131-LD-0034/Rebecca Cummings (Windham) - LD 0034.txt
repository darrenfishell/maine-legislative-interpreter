LD 34
I write in support of LD 34 - An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic 
Identification for the Purpose of Voting. Many activities of daily living require 
citizens to possess and/or produce a photo id (e.g. driving, travel, certain purchases, 
etc.). Showing a valid photo id will decrease the chances of voter fraud. Showing a 
valid id will assist new and seasoned poll workers in verification of unfamiliar/new 
residents within the community. Requiring a photo id to vote may incentivize Maine's
newcomers to become U.S. citizens in order to fully participate in municipal, state, 
and federal elections.
