LD 34
Dear Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee 
I ask you to support LD 34 Maine is one of just 15 states that does not require voters to show 
identification at the polls in order to vote on Election Day.
 
On election day this past November, there were several vans of young adults which showed 
up throughout the day. These youngg people came in and asked for a ballot. They were 
permitted to vote that day, no ID, nothing to confirm they even lived in the town in which they 
were voting. This happened dozens of times in our small town of Harrison and it happened in 
Bridgton as I have friends who worked the polls in both towns and reported this to the clerk of 
each town but nothing could be done. This is wrong. 
 
Polling shows that 80% of Americans support voter ID. That includes 62% of Democrats and 
87% of Independents.
 
Voter ID is a common-sense reform that would secure our elections and restore faith and 
trust in the results they produce. 
 
On Monday, lawmakers will hold a public hearing on LD 34, a bill to implement voter ID in 
Maine.
Thank you,
