Testimony Against LD 34: An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for
the Purpose of Voting
Presented to the Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
members
of
the
Committee
on
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs
-
my
name
is
Victor
Trepanier,
and
I’m
a
resident
of
Augusta
and
Vice
President
of
the
Hallowell
Pride
Alliance.
I’m
writing
today
to
testify
against
the
passage
of
LD
34: An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting .
Voting
is
a
sacred
part
of
our
democracy,
and
often
the
only
way
citizens
are
able
to
participate
in
it.
It
is
thus
of
vital
importance
that
we
protect
it.
I
feel
that
this
bill,
however,
dangerously
restricts
who
is
able
to
vote.
It
would
create
hurdles
for
many
people
-
the
working
class, those fleeing domestic violence, and transgender individuals to name a few.
Transgender
folks
have
come
increasingly
under
attack
in
state
legislatures
and
on
the
federal
level
for
the
past
few
years.
Though
this
bill,
on
its
face,
says
nothing
about
transgender
folks,
I
believe
it
presents
a
clear
danger
to
those
identifying
as
such.
The
need
for
photo
identification
means
that
someone
might
have
to
present
an
ID
that
no
longer
fully
represents
them.
If
an
individual
is
medically
transitioning,
not
only
may
their
personal
style
have
changed,
but
hormone
replacement
therapy
quite
literally
changes
a
person’s
facial
structure.
Then
a
transgender
person
may
be
forced
to
be
scrutinized
by
someone
(once
again)
-
and
perhaps
treated
like
a
liar,
a
stereotype
too
often
forced
upon
us.
The
uncomfortability
and
humiliation
of
that
situation
can
be
a
very
real
deterrent
for
transgender
folks,
who
are
forced
to
choose
between keeping themselves safe and being a part of our democracy.
A
response
may
be
to
tell
that
person
to
simply
get
a
new
ID,
but
that
process
that
so
many
people
take
for
granted
is
not
that
simple.
Getting
an
ID
requires
time
in
an
office,
such
as
the
Bureau
of
Motor
Vehicles.
It
requires
money
to
pay
for
a
new
ID.
It
may
also
require
losing
money
if
someone
must
take
time
off
of
work.
Transgender
folks,
because
of
how
they
are
mistreated
and
denied
opportunities
all
too
often,
are
frequently
among
the
poor
and
working
class
-
a
day
off
of
work
is
not
feasible
for
many
(and
this
is
true
for
cisgender
folks
in
the
same
socioeconomic status).
I
understand
that
Section
2
of
this
bill
proposes
that
the
Secretary
of
State’s
office
be
required
to
provide
new
photographic
identification
free
of
charge
for
the
express
purpose
of
voting.
I
question
how
“free”
that
actually
will
be
though
-
it
would
be
all
too
easy
for
one
to
upload
a
misleading
photograph,
leading
me
to
believe
that
more
than
likely
an
individual
would
need
to
physically
go
to
an
office
to
get
a
card,
leading
to
similar
hurdles
with
obtaining
a
driver’s
license.
This,
I
realize,
is
speculation,
but
we
would
be
remiss
not
to
think
of
these
provisions in action.
Finally
I
would
like
to
say
that
this
bill
is
just
completely
unnecessary.
Voter
fraud
rhetoric
and
misinformation
has
been
rife
since
the
last
presidential
election.
In
the
2020
election,
there
were
very
minimal
cases
of
voting
fraud
-
only
two
I
believe
(neither
of
which
had
to
do
with
impersonation).
Is
it
really
necessary
to
create
another
hurdle
to
voting
for
a
virtual
non-existent
problem? Especially when our voter turnout is already so low?
Though
I
am
testifying
on
the
behalf
of
transgender
individuals
like
myself,
I
truly
believe
LD
34
could
be
restrictive
for
many
Mainers.
I
hope
that
you
will
also
see
that
it
is
an
unnecessary and harmful bill, and will not vote to pass it.
Thank you.
