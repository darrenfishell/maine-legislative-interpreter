LD34
This bill is a no brainer  there is virtually nothing you do 
today that doesn’t need an Id . You even need a photo id 
to attend a school dance, I would venture to say that 
very few people don’t have a photo ID but they can get 
one at no charge at their local dmv. You can expect some 
to say that this will be a detriment to voting that is so far 
from the truth it is laughable. Today all I have to do is go 
to the pole and give your name and address and I will be 
allowed to vote, and when you go to vote you will be told 
that you already voted, with a photo ID you will not run 
into this problem. It is a positive step in securing election 
security. I ask you all to vote to yes on this bill and it 
should be allowed to move forward  with should pass.
