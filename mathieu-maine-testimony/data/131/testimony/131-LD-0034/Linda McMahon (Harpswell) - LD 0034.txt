Linda McMahon
Harpswell
LD 34
Good Day to Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and to the members of the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs Committee. 
My name is Linda McMahon. I am a taxpaying citizen of Harpswell-Representative District 99,
Senate District 23.
I am thankful for this opportunity to express my support for LD 34 An Act to Require a Person 
to Show Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting.
Voting is a citizen’s right. With personal rights come personal responsibilities. There should 
be no reluctance on any voters’ part to produce a photo ID to cast their vote. This is a 
commonsense issue that protects the security of our elections. Voters deserve to know that 
their vote is valued and that the election process is safe. Photo IDs are required for less 
valuable purposes and people readily produce them. In addition, this legislation will eliminate 
impersonation, double voting, vote casting by those not eligible and those voting under 
fictious registrations. It will also make the voting process smoother and straightforward for 
those staffing the polls. Let’s eliminate the ugly suspicions that clouded recent elections.
I urge this committee to vote “ought to pass” on LD 34.
Thank you.
Respectfully submitted, 
Linda McMahon
