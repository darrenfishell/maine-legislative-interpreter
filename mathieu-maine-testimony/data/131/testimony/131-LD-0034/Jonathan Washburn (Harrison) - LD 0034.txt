LD 34
Photo ID is an important and normal manner of identification of oneself. 
Citizens are required to provide a photo ID to police officers at a traffic stop, to board an 
airplane and for other government and business purposes. In none of these cases are the 
citizen's rights being violated. Therefore, I urge you to vote in favor of LD34. As never before, 
we need integrity in the outcome and processes of our elections. If citizens do not believe an 
election was conducted honestly there will be civil strife. Protect our elections by supporting a 
photo ID requirement in order to vote.
