LD 34
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the VLA committee. I Peter
Laing of Searsmont am in FAVOR of LD34 because it is part of the solution in 
eliminating VOTER FRAUD. Besides, we need ID for many things in our society. 
Voting is so important- it should be required. Thank you for reading this testimony.
