LD 34
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans Committee,I, 
Diana Laing from Searsmont support LD34 - to show photo ID at the time of voting. 
As a poll watcher and worker, it would provide a second verification that we are 
checking off the correct person and many people had their ID at the ready anyway. I 
also had trouble understanding the names of a couple of voters - they had their ID in 
hand and that made it easier for both of us.  Thank you for presenting this opportunity
to listen/read my testimony.
