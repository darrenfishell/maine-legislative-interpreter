Pete Harring
Washington
LD 34
Senator Craig Hickman, Representative Laura Supica  and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs,
   My name is Pete Harring from Washington, ME. I am not a lobbyist or a member of any 
special interests group. I am an American citizen and a resident here in the Great State of 
Maine. In order to help insure integrity with our voting process and help remove doubt from 
the minds of the People. I come to you today to ask that you vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 34 
“An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting”. 
Particularly in today's world, where a picture ID is required to cash a check, start a new job, or
even get vaccinated for Covid,  I can not think of a single reasonable reason why an 
individual casting a vote should not be required to submit a Picture ID.
Thank you for your time, and I respectfully ask that you vote
 “Ought to Pass.” 
May you all have a Blessed day.
Pete Harring
