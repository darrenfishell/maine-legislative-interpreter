LD34 SP26   Feb. 2023 An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic 
Identification for the purpose of Voting   Linda P. Haskell I agree with Photographic 
information BUT I do not agree that we the People allow the Secretary of State to 
produce free voter photograph identification to any individual!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is 
the Legal Residents of the State of Maine who have the power to demand the 
Secretary of State to abide by the legislation already in place.
