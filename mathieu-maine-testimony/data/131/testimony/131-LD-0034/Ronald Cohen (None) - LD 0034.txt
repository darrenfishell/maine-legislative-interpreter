To all members of the Veterans Legal Affairs Committee, 
I would like to express my support for requiring a photo ID when voting at all governmental polls. The right to 
vote in U.S. elections is a right for U.S. ‘Citizens. With the heavy increase in illegal, undocumented people 
entering this country, it is now more important than ever to have this law put into place. We should not be 
allowing non-citizens to control how our government is being run. These non-citizens are welcomed into this 
country, but until they become citizens, they should not have the right to vote in any of our governmental 
elections. People come to this country because of the rights and freedoms that we have. But these rights and 
freedoms should not be freely given to those who have not earned them, whether it be by being born in this 
great country or choosing to come here through the legal process and earning the right to be called a United 
States Citizen. There are many things in this country that require the use of a photo ID. You need an ID to buy 
cigarettes, alcohol, lottery tickets, guns, etc. You need an ID to get on a plane to travel within the US anda 
passport to travel abroad. If none of these things is infringing on the rights of U.S. Citizens, then Why is 
requiring proof of ID to vote in elections that control these laws, an infringement on U.S. Citizens ’ rights? I 
strongly believe that only U.S. Citizens should dictate how the United States of America is run. 
I appreciate your time and hope you take what I have said into consideration. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Ronald Cohen‘
