I am the son of a legal immigrant that came to this country after WWII having 
escaped being rounded up by Nazi's not once but twice during the occupation of 
Holland. He came here for a better life for himself like any other person would have 
at that time. He arrived with a job and housing waiting for him. He learned English. 
He became a US citizen. He married my mother who just a few years earlier had lost 
her fiance in the battle of TaeJon North Korea. They raised a family and showed me 
that good character and hard work will be rewarded with a full life of Freedom, and 
Happiness. The vision of the Founding Fathers of this country. 
But now this country is being flooded with people who don't share in that vision. 
They come here and don't expect to work for any of this American Dream. They 
expect to be handed free housing and food to live. A check in the mail instead of a 
job. And there are people, evil people, who want them to be able to vote. So they can 
remain on the free ride our government is giving them. Living off the hard work of 
those who have earned the right to say they are a United States Citizen. You need to 
show an ID to board a plane, cash a check, buy alcohol or cigarettes, rent a movie, get
a book from the library. It should damn well be required to show your ID to vote in 
any election.
