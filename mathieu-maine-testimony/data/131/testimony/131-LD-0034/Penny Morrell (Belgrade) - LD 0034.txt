To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs
Regarding L.D. 34, 
"An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting
February 6, 2023
Sen. Hickman, Rep. Supica, and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.  I’m Penny Morrell, taxpayer 
and citizen of the Town of Belgrade, Maine.  I am also chairman of the Belgrade GOP, 
though I am not speaking for them as we have not had a meeting to discuss this bill and 
take a position.  
I support LD 34, An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the 
Purpose of Voting, sponsored by Senator Matt Pouliot.
We’ve all heard the cries of voter fraud and stolen elections coming from Democrat 
Hillary Clinton and others.  That issue can cause qualified voters to be disenfranchised 
and not vote because if even one illegal vote is cast, it negates one legal vote from 
counting.  That should never happen in a free and just society and our great State of 
Maine.
Voter ID can prevent and deter:
Impersonation fraud at the polls;
Voting under fictitious voter registrations;
Double voting by individuals registered in more than one state or locality; and
Voting by illegal aliens, or even legal aliens who are still not entitled to vote since 
state and federal elections are restricted to U.S. citizens.
Researchers for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that between 2008 and 2016, 
voter ID laws had “no negative effect on registration or turnout, overall or for any specific 
group defined by race, gender, age or party affiliation.”
—Hans von Spakovsky and Caleb Morrison (2019)[7]
I urge this committee to vote “ought to pass” on LD 34.  Thank you.
