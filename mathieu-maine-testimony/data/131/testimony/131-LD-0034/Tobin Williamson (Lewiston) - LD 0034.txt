Tobin Williamson
Lewiston
LD 34
Dear Committee Members:
My name is Tobin Williamson and I live in the city of Lewiston in Androscoggin 
County. I work for the Maine Immigrants' Rights Coalition (MIRC).
I am testifying in opposition to LD 34, An Act to Require a Person to Show 
Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting.  Voter ID laws often 
disproportionately discriminate against BIPOC communities (including immigrants), 
senior citizens, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals. As the ACLU 
says, "voter identification laws are a part of an ongoing strategy to roll back decades 
of progress on voting rights."
As both an individual who wants to see more people participate in the electoral 
process and on behalf of an organization which works to enhance the lives of Maine's 
immigrant communities, I encourage you to oppose LD 34. We should be making it 
easier to be part of the civic engagement process; this bill would do the opposite of 
that. 
Thank you.
