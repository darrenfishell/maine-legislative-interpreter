LD 34
I'm writing in support of LD 34, "An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic 
Identification for the Purpose of Voting."
Eighteen other states already require photo ID to vote, out of a total of 35 states that 
have some form of voter ID laws.
Voters across all demographics support voter ID laws in virtually every poll by almost
80%. This typically includes more than 60% of Democrats.
Voter ID laws have no negative effect on registration or turnout overall or for any 
specific group defined by race, gender, age, or party affiliation.
Despite dire warnings from the voter suppression hysteria groups, there is no evidence
that voter ID laws have prevented eligible voters from casting a ballot.
Voter ID laws can stop multiple types of fraud, such as impersonating another 
registered voter, preventing noncitizens from voting, and stopping out-of-state 
residents or someone registered in multiple jurisdictions. Itâ€™s safe to say there is 
bipartisan consensus for voter ID but a clear partisan divide in the political class.
Voter ID is a common sense measure to ensure free, fair and legitimate elections. I 
urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" on LD 34.
