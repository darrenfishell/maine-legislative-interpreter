LD 34
2/3/2023
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Maine Legislative 
Committee on Veterans and legal Affairs, I am Mike McClellan. I am a former Maine
House member (125th, 126th and 127th) and I live in Raymond, Maine. 
I write in support of Senator Pouliot's proposed bill, LD 34. This legislation appears 
simple and would go a long way to ensure our elections can again be viewed as safe 
and honest. Perception is so important and currently, there are many who (rightly or 
wrongly) view our state and national elections as tainted. One result is some people 
decide not to participate because they do not trust the system. Sen. Pouliot's bill 
would seem to solve much of the problem. Voting in elections should be for people 
who are eligible just as the political parties represented on your committee would 
require a Voter ID to attend your political conventions. If this legislation does not 
pass, can I assume both of your next conventions would be open without ID?
We know there was a day that politics were used to keep some people,  women and 
minorities in particular, from voting. Those "rules" were stopped and now all have 
access to vote in Maine and the USA. We have rules as to who is qualified to vote and
as our elected leaders, you should enforce those rules. This legislation would help you
perform your duty.
A past argument that some people do not have ID's would seem to not hold water 
anymore. Searching lists of what you need ID for would show that any adult would 
need an ID to maneuver though our 2023 society. ID's can be gotten at no cost and I 
believe Sen. Pouliot's legislation includes an avenue to receive an ID at no cost. 
I pray you affirm this for the good of Maine citizens. If we have rules/laws and do not
enforce them, they are worthless and allow a perception that other rules/laws are open
for discussion. I urge you to please nail this one down firmly.
Thank you for your service,
Mike
