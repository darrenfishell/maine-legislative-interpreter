LD 34
I support LD 34, “An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for
the Purpose of Voting”.
This bill requires the presentation of proof of identity in the form of a photograph  
identification document when voting in person. A common-sense, logical 
requirement.
For those without a photo ID, the bill also allows a person to request a free special 
voter photograph identification card from the Secretary of State. There are NO 
excuses for not having a photo ID.
Maine is one of 15 states that currently don’t require a photo ID to vote. Time to get 
with the program and help to reinforce our confidence in our election system. 
I support LD 34, “An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the 
Purpose of Voting” and it “ought to pass”.
