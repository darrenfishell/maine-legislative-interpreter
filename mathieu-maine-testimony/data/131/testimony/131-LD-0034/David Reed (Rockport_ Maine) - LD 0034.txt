Honorable Senator Pouliot and Represenatatives Morris and 
Timberlake, I support your bill to require a photo ID to vote. As much public doubt as there is 
concerning the 2020 national elections and the 2022 midterms, every effort must be made to 
restore confidence in the sanctity of our elections.
