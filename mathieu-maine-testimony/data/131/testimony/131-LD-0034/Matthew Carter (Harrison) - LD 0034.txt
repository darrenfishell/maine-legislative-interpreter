Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,
     
I have heard far too many folks in recent years, many for the first time ever, begin to question 
the integrity of our elections. These are people from all walks of life and political affiliations. 
Democrats, Republicans, & Independents. We can all agree this is both unfortunate and 
concerning. For myself, it has become so frequent that I have begun to wonder if I should feel
the same way, worried that I might be naively towing a line that complacently says "our 
system has worked fine so far". This has left me wishing that there were simple ways to 
reassure the voting public that our elected representatives hear these concerns, take them 
seriously, and are willing to take practical steps to address them.
I believe this proposed legislation could be a good first step to that end. ID 
requirements already exist far and wide in our states and throughout our country. I 
have never met a contributing member of our society (and everyone has something of 
value to contribute), who was of voting age, who doesn't have an ID of some kind. 
You need an ID to cash a check, open a bank account, or buy alcohol and tobacco. If 
you join the military or enroll in college, you get an ID. Work in a medical facility or 
other institution that protects the privacy of those who benefit from their services, and
you are required to display your ID for all to see that you are authorized to be there. 
But why is there no such qualification  to vote?
I respectfully urge the Committee to vote "ought to pass" on LD 34. Thank you for 
your tireless and sometimes thankless work. I sincerely appreciate your willingness to
continually let reason guide you.
Kind regards,
Matthew Carter
