OPPORTUNITY SOLUTIONS PROJECT 2Chair Hickman, Chair Supica, and honorable members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today. My name is Madeline Malisa, and I’m a visiting fellow at the Opportunity Solutions Project. OSP is a non-
partisan, non-profit organization. We work in more than 40 states across the country with one clear goal—to 
help more people achieve the American Dream. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today in support of this 
legislation.
Mainers are passionate about the fundamental right that we all have as Americans to vote and participate in our 
democratic process. We don’t want loopholes and weaknesses in the design of elections to threaten that right. 
No voter should have their vote canceled out or diluted by an improper vote.
LD 34 will require that voters present a photo ID when they vote in person. It will also ensure a free voter ID is 
provided to any Mainer who needs one. Voter ID is the single most effective and secure way to verify a voter’s 
identity. It does this in a very practical way. It simply requires that a voter prove they are who they say they are. 
It removes the problems of guesswork or lack of training inherent in other verification processes, which can lead 
to improper votes being counted and legal votes being rejected.
Voter ID requirements are also important for voter confidence. Voters need to have confidence in the election 
process in order to have confidence in the election results. They want to know that they are voting in free, fair, 
and secure elections. 
Of course, showing an ID isn’t groundbreaking or new for residents in Maine. Anyone who has ever been 
checked into a hospital, picked up a prescription, opened a bank account, or bought a beer knows that 
producing an ID is just a normal part of everyday life. For residents who do not have an ID, offering a free voter 
ID provides an easy option to meet this requirement.  
Voter ID laws have been widely enacted across the country. Currently, Maine is one of only 15 states where 
voters can cast their ballot without showing an ID document. This is a significant vulnerability in the election 
process.
In 35 states, voters must show some type of ID document to vote.1 Under a strict ID requirement, voters without 
acceptable identification will vote on provisional ballots and then return to an election office within a few days 
to show an acceptable ID. Other northeastern states have this requirement like New Hampshire and Rhode 
Island.2 
Just this month, Ohio enacted comprehensive voter ID requirements for both in-person and absentee voting. In 
2022, Florida, South Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri all passed bills to strengthen their voter ID laws. 
This session, voter ID bills have been introduced in Nebraska, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
To give you an international perspective, 46 of 47 European countries require some form of identification to 
vote.3 The exception is the United Kingdom, which will begin requiring photo ID in May 2023.4 Our regional 
neighbors, Canada and Mexico, both require photo ID and countries across the world to do as well, including 
Argentina, India, and Israel.5 
Voter ID is good policy and it is clear that Americans agree. Nationally, nearly eight in 10 Americans support 
photo ID requirements and consider election integrity and security very important to them.6 Voter ID laws are 
popular for a reason—voters understand that they increase security in the process and certainty in the outcome. 
OPPORTUNITY SOLUTIONS PROJECT 3In closing, I commend the sponsor for introducing this important legislation. Public access to and public 
confidence in the integrity of elections are fundamental components of enduring freedom. When Mainers cast 
their ballots, they deserve to know that their votes will count. I appreciate your time today and I’m happy to 
answer any questions.
