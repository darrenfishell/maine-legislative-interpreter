Dear Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee - 
I write to urge you vote in support of this bill and move it along to the full House, 
where I will write my state Representative and then my state Senator to support this 
bill.
That Maine is one of less than a third of states that doesn't require voter ID is 
mind-boggling and should be embarrassing.  We have had a tremendous influx of 
immigrants, new people moving in to the state, and we have had an increase in second
and vacation home purchases.  There is no way of telling if any of these people have 
the right to vote here - and only here. Given the voting related mailings that I received
at my address in 2020, some of whom were likely the owners of the house two 
purchases or more before, the voting rolls are a mess in my town (and likely others).  
I've written to my legislators when they send a mailing to my address for someone 
who no longer/maybe never did live there.  I have notified the town that those names 
are no longer/were never accurate.
While voting rolls absolutely need to be cleaned up by towns and within the state, 
voter ID will help ensure protection of our voting process.  Voter ID is supported by a
majority of Mainers (as it is Americans around the country).
This is absolutely an "Ought to Pass" vote and to vote otherwise is irresponsible.
