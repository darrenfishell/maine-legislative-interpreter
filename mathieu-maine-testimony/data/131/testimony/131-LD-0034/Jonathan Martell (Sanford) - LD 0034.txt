Good Morning,
I am writing in support of LD 34 - An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic 
Identification for the Purpose of Voting. In order to maintain fairness to the citizens of
Maine that are taxpayers and represented in Augusta, it would only make sense to 
maintain accurate vote counts to those that are legally able to vote. Voter fraud has 
been a concern of both sides and it is time that Maine move past antiquated times 
when towns were small and poll workers knew the people they were checking off as 
voting. Move Maine forward, require an ID to vote. It is required for almost every 
other normal activity, and certainly for any legal use of your name. It is needed in 
Maine. Thank you for your time.
