Dear Members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee,
After the 2020 presidential election, Senator Pouliot was asked on his Facebook page 
if he accepted the results. His answer was, "Yes I accept the results. Yes I believe 
there was some level of fraud, but not enough to overturn the results." When pressed -
multiple times - to either provide proof of this supposed "some level of fraud" or 
retract his statement, he responded with silence. Now, he is expanding his unproven 
claim into a bill. It's disappointing that the party that constantly rails against 
government spending and regulations is now proposing an expensive, burdensome 
solution to a problem that doesn't actually exist at any level significant enough to 
justify it.
I'm sure the pro-voter id crowd will show up today and be quite vocal, but shouting 
misinformation loudly and repeatedly will thankfully never convert lies into actual 
facts. As the ACLU and the Brennan Center for Justice have laid out far better 
arguments against voter id laws than I could ever possibly craft myself (based on 
actual studies and not the desire to increase voter suppression), I will simply drop 
links to their pages here so you can peruse them yourself.
