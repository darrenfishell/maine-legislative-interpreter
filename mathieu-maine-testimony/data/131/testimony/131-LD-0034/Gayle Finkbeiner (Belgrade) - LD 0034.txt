I support the requirement that Maine voters demonstrate that they are American 
citizens and are residents of the State of Maine and live in the locality in which they 
are voting. They would do this by presenting photographic identification of 
themselves that has been certified by the State of Maine government such as a 
Driver's license or a Maine government provided Photo Identification for voting 
purposes. Such a requirement would help prevent fraud and mistakes which 
undermines the legitimacy of our democratic Republic in Maine and the American 
nation. I urge the committee to support this commonsense legislation.
