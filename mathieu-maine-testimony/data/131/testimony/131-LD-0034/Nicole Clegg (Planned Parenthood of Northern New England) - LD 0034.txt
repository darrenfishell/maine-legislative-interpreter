Sena tor Hickman, R epresen tative Supic a and member s of the Join t Standing Commit tee onVeterans and Leg al Af fairs, my name is Nic ole Cleg g and I ser ve as the Senior Vice Pr esiden t ofPublic Af fairs at Planned P arenthood of Northern Ne w England and I am pleased t o submittestimon y in opposition t o LD 34.
Planned P arenthood of Northern Ne w England pr ovides c ompr ehensiv e reproductiv e and se xualhealth c are to mor e than 14,000 people in Maine a t four health cen ters loc ated in Bidde ford,Portland, San ford and T opsham. P eople turn t o us f or affordable, high-quality c are includingwellness e xams, birth c ontrol, disease t esting and tr eatmen t, cancer scr eenings, abortion c areas w ell as a v ariety of primar y care ser vices. W e see e veryone who c omes t o us r egardless ofability t o pa y, and in a typic al year, we provide mor e than $4 million in fr ee and disc ounted careto our c ommunities in Maine.
As a mission driv en health c are provider , we fundamen tally belie ve everyone should be able t oget affordable, high quality se xual and r eproductiv e health c are in their c ommunities, no ma tterwher e the y live or ho w much mone y the y mak e and w e adv ocate for policies tha t help mak ethis vision a r eality . As a healthc are provider which oft en w orks with mar ginaliz ed popula tionswe are incr edibly tr oubled b y the pr oposals be fore this c ommit tee to introduce a phot o IDrequir emen t for voting.
This pr oposal os tensibly ser ves to addr ess a pr oblem, in-per son V oter imper sona tion, tha t doesnot in- fact e xist to an y signific ant extent in our s tate. Even the c onser vative Herit ageFounda tion, which has put signific ant resour ces t oward resear ching v oter fr aud and electionirregularities in e very state, cannot find s tatistically signific ant evidence of v oter imper sona tionin Maine1.
While the pr oblem LD 34 seek s to alle viate does not t o an y measur able e xtent exist, theproposal itself , would, if enact ed, ha ve a signific ant impact in r educing v oter turnout b y eligibleMainer s. A 2014 s tudy b y the U .S. Go vernmen t Acc ountability Of fice, f ound tha t voter IDreduced turnout in K ansas and T ennessee b y as much as 3%. Tha t would ha ve transla ted to thesuppr ession of o ver 27,000 eligible Maine v oters in 20202.
Not only w ould such a r equir emen t carry with it the pot ential t o suppr ess the v otes ofother wise eligible v oters,  it w ould do so in such a w ay as t o dispr oportiona tely a ffectdisadv antaged popula tions; w eighing mos t hea vily on those segmen ts of our s tate alr eady

Breakdown of “Voter Fraud”
underr epresen ted in the elect orate particularly BIPOC Mainer s; Young Mainer s; disabledMainer s and ec onomic ally disadv antaged Mainer s.
If the g oal of this pr oposal is t o strengthen Maine’ s already sa fe and secur e elections, w e urgethe Legisla ture to ins tead w ork t o expand access t o ong oing ab sentee voting , incr ease supportfor election w orkers, and pr ovide additional funding f or state and loc al election adminis tratorsto ha ve suf ficien t trained s taff as w ell as implemen ting other upda tes to moderniz e ourelections and elections in frastructur e.
In closing , the imposition of a phot o ID r equir emen t for voting is not jus t wrong f or Maine, it isoffensiv e to the f ounding e thos of this s tate and this c ountry. Democr acy isn’t tr ansactional, andpolling places ar en’t r etail stores. Their loc ations, pr ocesses, and c osts ar e not supposed t o beeasily accessible f or some but se verely out of r each f or other s.  The fr eedom t o vote withoutregard to race, cr eed, r eligion, se xual orien tation, ph ysical ability or ec onomic s tatus isfundamen tal to our democr acy, it is wha t binds us t ogether as a people, as a s tate and as acounty.  For all these r easons, I s trongly ur ge you to vote not t o pass LD 34.
