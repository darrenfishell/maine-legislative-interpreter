This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
After moving to Maine full time about 20 years ago, I was surprised the first time I voted here when they did NOT ask to 
see a drivers license other other identification. The 2 previous states where I had lived m and voted- New York and 
Virginia- required showing a photo ID and no-one I know of ever had a problem with doing that. Considering the huge 
number of non-citizens who have been flooding our country the last few years would seem to make it even more 
important that those who are voting are legal citizens of the United States of America. Nationally we have backed off of 
requiring that voters also be tax payers, but they should at least be legal citizens of the country with an actual address 
where they live. I also think Maine should get rid of being able to register to vote right up until the polls close on 
election day, but that's another issue. For now let's at least require having and showing a photo ID before being given 
the privilege to vote.
