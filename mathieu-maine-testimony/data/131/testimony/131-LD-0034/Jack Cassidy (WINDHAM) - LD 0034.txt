Requiring a Person to Show Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting is 
crucial for the integrity of the voting process. I am required to show an ID when I 
purchase items such as Alcohol, Cannabis, at Banks as well as Medical Facilities, just 
to name a few. There is no undue burden on any group to show a photographic ID, as 
it is required for many everyday situations.
