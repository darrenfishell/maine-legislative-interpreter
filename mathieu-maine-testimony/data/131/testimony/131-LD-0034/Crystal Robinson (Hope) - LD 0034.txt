LD 34
I support LD 34   An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic Identification for
the Purpose of Voting 
As an American, I want to restore faith in the integrity of our elections.  Voter ID is 
one way to do this and it is not racist.   It is a way to ensure that each Maine resident 
votes only once in each election. 
Photo IDs are common.  One cannot drive or fly without a photo ID yet no one 
complains that this is racist.   According to a poll conducted on Jan. 17 by the 
University of Georgia’s School of Public & International Affairs, the percentage of 
black voters who said they had a “poor” experience at the polls was zero.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
