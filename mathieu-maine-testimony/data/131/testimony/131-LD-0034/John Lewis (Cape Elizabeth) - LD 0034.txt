Subject: [VLA] Support LD 34 
This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature. 
Good morning members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee Members, 
l am writing to you today asking you to please advance LD 34, presented by Senator Matt Pouliot, which would require 
photo identification for the purposes of voting. Recent polling shows that 8 in 10 Americans support voter ID, including 
77% of people of color. Support for voter ID also transcends political parties, where the majority of Republicans AND 
Democrats are in favor of requiring an ID to vote. In addition to the overwhelming support for requiring a photo 
identification, it is also common sense. 
Below are a links to the referenced surveys for your review. Thank you for your consideration.
