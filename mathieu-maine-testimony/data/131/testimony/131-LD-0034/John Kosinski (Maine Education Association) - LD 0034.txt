Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and other members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee,  
 
My name is John Kosinski and I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the Maine Education 
Association (MEA) in opposition to LD 34, An Act to Require a Person to Show Photographic 
Identification for the Purpose of Voting and LD 237, An Act t o Require a Registered Voter to Update 
the Registration.  The MEA represents 24,000 educators in Maine, including teachers and other staff in 
nearly every public -school district in the state, and faculty and other professional staff in the University 
of Ma ine and Community College systems.   
 
Every day, educators across the state teach students about the power and purpose of American 
democracy.  Our schools celebrate our nation’s democratic systems, and educators attempt to instill in 
students the need to e xercise their civic duty to vote and fully participate in our country’s democratic 
institutions.  We know our country thrives when voters exercise their right to vote.  Only then do we 
know our elected officials truly reflect the decisions of the people th ey are elected to serve.  
 
In this context, we find it disconcerting and troubling to see legislative proposals before this body 
designed to limit and/or interfere with the ability for Maine people to vote.  Both LD 34 and LD 237 will 
undoubtedly do just th at.  They both represent new obstacles to voting, and will serve to disenfranchise 
voters.  And these bills are wholly unnecessary.  There is no evidence of voter fraud in Maine’s election.  
In fact, Maine is often a leader in the country in terms of voter  turnout.  Our electoral systems are 
healthy and fair.  We might not always like the outcomes, and there is a new troubling trend from 
unsuccessful candidates challenging the integrity of voting systems, but claims of voter fraud in Maine 
are specious at b est.   
 
These bills are the quintessential solution in search of a problem.  But the “solutions” proposed in LD 34 
and LD 237 will have negative repercussions for Maine people.  Whether intentionally or 
unintentionally, if these proposals are enacted, some  voters will be unnecessarily disenfranchised.

For these reasons, we hope the Committee will vote “ought not to pass” on LD 34 
and LD 237.  In the meantime, educators around the state will continue the work of 
educating students about our history’s fragile and unique democracy, and the need 
for all Ame ricans to exercise their civic duty to vote.
