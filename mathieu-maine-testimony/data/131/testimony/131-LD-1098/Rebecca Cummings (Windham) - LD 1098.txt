As a registered nurse in the state of Maine, and possessing over ten years of 
experience as an elementary school nurse, I SUPPORT medical, religious, and 
philosophical immunization exemptions. Individuals have a right to refuse 
medication(s). Patients cannot and should not be forced to take an experimental 
vaccine/medication only available under emergency use authorization for which our 
government LIED about there not being at least one known effective treatment. I urge
this committee to restore medical, religious, and philosophical exemptions effective 
immediately AND apologize to the health care professionals who advocated for their 
patients and were harassed by peers, politicians, and medical boards. I SUPPORT 
MEDICAL, RELIGOUS, AND PHILOSOPHICAL EXEMPTIONS!
