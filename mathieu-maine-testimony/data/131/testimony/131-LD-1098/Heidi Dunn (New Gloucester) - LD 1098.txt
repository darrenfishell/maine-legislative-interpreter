LD 1098
My family of 7 was living in New Hampshire back in 2016 when my husband had the
opportunity come up in his job, where he could work remotely from anywhere. 
Having both grown up in Maine, we couldn't wait to come back and raise our family. 
Maine was a state that always prided itself in a sort of mind your own business, 
self-sufficient attitude.  Well, a mere 3 years later all that changed when the state 
decided to very much get in our personal business remove religious and philosophical 
exemptions to attend school. I have always homeschooled our children, due in part to 
my husband being in the military and us moving a few times while they were young, 
but I will soon be graduating some of them and the fact that they can't attend college 
in Maine is quite frustrating.  My children love living here, but in order to further 
their education they will have to go out of state where exemptions are still accepted. 
Do we really want to lose even more of our youth in this state because of an 
unconstitutional law like this one? Please vote in favor of LD1098 and ANY bills like
it to restore Religious and Philosophical exemptions to Immunizations.
