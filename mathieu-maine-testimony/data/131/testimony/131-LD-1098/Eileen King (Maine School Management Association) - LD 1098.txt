Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King , deputy executive director of M aine School  Management  Association, testifying  on behalf of 
the legislative committee s of the Maine School Board s Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association rega rding L .D. 1098, L.D. 1209, and L.D. 51. Both committees were oppo sed to L.D. 109 8 and 
L.D. 51; MSBA was opposed to L.D. 1209  and MSSA was neither for nor against . 
 
Superintendents are charged with overseeing the operations of our school districts and  our first obligation is to 
keep  students safe. One way we do that is to enforce  vacci nation requirement s, and the law requires us to do 
that. 
 
Title 20 -A, Section 6359  states:  
 
Enrollment of school: No chief administrative office r may permit any student to b e enrolled in or attend 
school without a certificate of immunization for each diseas e or other acceptable evidence of required 
immunization or immunity against the disease except as follows: The parent or the student provided a written 
statement from a lic ensed physician, nurse, nurse practitioner’s or physician assistant that in their pr ofessional 
judgement , immunization against one or more of the disease may be medically inadvisable.  
 
The law underscores that student safety is paramount in our obligation a s school leaders, and we believe the 
exemptions to the rules being considered today  prevent us from fulfilling that obligation and would put 
students at risk.
