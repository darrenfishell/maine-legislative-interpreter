Testimony of Hadassah P . Beal
Testimony in Support of LD 1098
An Act to Restore Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization
Requirements
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Honorable Members of the Committee on 
Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Hadassah Beal of Cherryfield, Maine. Thank you for 
the opportunity to address the committee. I am writing in support of LD 51, An Act to Restore 
Religious and Philosophical Exemptions to Immunization Requirements . I support LD 51 because 
I believe every person should have the right to decide what they will take for medical procedures.
Maine citizens should have the right to accept or reject any vaccine, medical procedure, or 
treatment. Unvaccinated Mainers should not lose rights and privileges based on the medical 
choices they make. Over the last few years, we have seen vaccination laws and mandates take 
away the jobs of hard working adults,  because they were  forced to either give in to these 
unconstitutional regulations, or stand up against tyranny and do their part to protect our God-
given rights.
As for unvaccinated children, medical decisions should rest solely with the parents. It is 
not the job of the government to mandate what an individual must take in order to attend a 
school, college, or any institution, nor is it their right to create penalties for those who choose 
not to comply. Current Maine laws that mandate vaccination are an infringement on our rights as
an American citizen.  The 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution states, “ No State shall make 
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United 
States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of 
law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” 
I respectfully urge you to please vote in favor of LD 1098.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Hadassah P . Beal
