Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the 
Committee of Education and Cultural Affairs,
I am a public-school educator along with being a mother, Christian, wife of a 
children's pastor, and citizen. I am providing written testimony in support of LD 51, 
LD 869, LD 1098, LD 1148, LD 1209, and LD 1228 today. I'll keep my testimony 
brief, but the bottom line is that public education should be available to all, with no 
strings attached. As I see every day in our wonderful schools, kids are clothed, fed, 
counseled, cared for, and educated, no matter what else describes them. Vaccination 
status should be no different. It should be a human right in the bettering of our society
and world, and no one should be excluded, nor discriminated from that right. 
Everyone should have the freedom to choose what is best for their family in regard to 
medical decisions.  Mental health has suffered enough with the Covid pandemic, let's 
include and build up, not exclude society. Children, of all people, have been excluded.
Their families have had to pull them out of the place that they've grown up in in so 
many ways of development.  It truly doesn't make sense that children can attend 
public school events, but not school itself. It's heartbreaking. I also strongly support 
the right to choose for our private and virtual school students, along with our 
wonderful medical professionals. Please vote Ought to Pass, and let's build our Maine
back up.
