Re: L.D. 1533, an Act to Provide for Consistent Billing Practices by Health Care Providers 
Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Committee: 
The Bureau of Insurance takes no position on L.D. 1533.  The purpose of this letter is to provide 
you with background information. This bill would add a provision to the Health Security Act 
subchapter on Billing for Health Care (24 M.R.S. §§ 2985 – 2988) requiring the “off-campus 
outpatient department[s]” of health care facilities to obtain National Provider Identifiers that are 
distinct from the facilities’ NPIs as a prerequisite to reimbursement/payment for services 
provided in those departments.  The bill would prohibit claiming for or holding an enrollee 
responsible for services not billed using the distinct NPI or using the federal standardized claims 
form.  Proposed 24 M.R.S. § 2989(5) would prohibit a facility that does not bill for health care 
services provided at such a department as required by the bill from holding the enrollee liable for 
payment, and make a violation of this prohibition a violation of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices 
Act (5 M.R.S. Ch. 10), with enforcement authority with the Office of the Attorney General.  The 
bill would permit the Superintendent to refer providers to DHHS for violations of the law and 
permit DHHS to take enforcement action.  
It is important for billing to accurately reflect where a health care service is actually performed. 
Billing for a service that is performed at a less expensive facility at the rate charged for a more 
expensive facility could have a negative impact on premiums and consumer cost-sharing, leading 
to higher health care costs for consumers. 
I hope this information is useful to the Committee.  Please let me know if I can provide any 
further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
 
Timothy N. Schott 
Acting Superintendent
