LD 1533
Dear Health Coverage Insurances and Financial Services Committee,
My name is Megan Marquis, and I live in China Village. I am writing today to ask 
you to support LD 1533.
This affects me and my lifespan because it's another huge barrier to healthcare. I am 
incredibly frustrated that we need a proposed policy to correct what is currently 
legalized extorsion for medical care. Just because similar care happens in another 
building, doesn't mean Health providers get to overcharge.  Insurance companies 
already do that. So why should healthcare providers be allowed to follow in their 
extorsion like footsteps too? Where will the extorsion end? Just stop this before more 
Mainers become financially bankrupt trying to access healthcare. 
So support LD 1533 or be comfortable being complicit with extorsion like practices 
that ultimately kill people earlier than they're supposed to, by making care even more 
inaccessible.
