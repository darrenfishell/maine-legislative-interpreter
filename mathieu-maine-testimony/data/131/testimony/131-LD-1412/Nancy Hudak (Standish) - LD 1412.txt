LD 1412
As a 68-year-old citizen of Maine since childhood, I know how far the state has come 
in protecting the rights of ALL of its citizens. 
I testified with my daughter and her partner at the 2009 public hearing backing 
same-sex marriage. 
I proudly voted in favor of the successful 2012 Referendum on that same issue.
Now, many years later, I worry about the young people who do not quite fit into the 
categories of the Maine Human Rights Act - particularly in the current national 
political environment. 
I support LD 1412 because it would make crystal clear Maine's strong support for all 
human rights. The state would join many others in this endeavor.
As goes Maine, so - we can only hope - goes the nation.
