Re:  Support of LD 1412  - RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights 
Under the Law
Dear Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Mary Laughlin and I live in Limington.  As I understand, LD 1412 
proposes to enshrine the civil rights of the Maine Human Rights Act as an amendment
to the Maine Constitution.  Those rights include actual or perceived race, color, 
religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or 
mental disability, ancestry or national origin.  Being a part of our state constitution 
will afford these rights the greatest protection and enforcement.  And being able to 
vote for the amendment in a statewide election will be a proud opportunity for Maine 
voters.  Please vote “ought to pass” in committee. 
Thank you.
