LD 1412
    My name is Asherah Cinnamon. I am writing in support of LD 1412. I have lived 
in Maine for 40+years. For the last 20 years in Limington. I am female, and the 
mother of a young woman.
    I was an immigrant to the US as a child, with my parents and only surviving  
grandmother. We all survived the Nazi Holocaust of  WWII. I was in utero and ready 
to be born at the end of 4 years in which my tiny family endured the Ghetto of 
Shanghai, along with 20,000 other European refugee Jews, who were herded into that 
Ghetto, post Pearl Harbor, by the Japanese military (in its role as ally to Hitler).
    I grew up believing that this is the Nation of Freedom. Racial Segregation was a 
shock and huge disappointment. We have made important strides to right those 
wrongs (not enough by far, but steps in the right direction). 
    I grew up believing that this Nation (unlike Hitler's Germany) was founded on 
religious freedom, but recent events make that belief terrifyingly thin.
   The freedom to control our own bodies has recently been whipped away from me 
and my daughter, by sectarian religious zealotry that does not belong in our 
government.
    I am asking  YOU to approve this bill today, so that the State of Maine can begin 
again to reclaim the proud values I believe most people in this State treasure, for 
themselves and their children and neighbors.
Thank you.
