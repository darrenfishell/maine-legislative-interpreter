Maine Family Planning  
Testimony in Support  
LD 1412, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents 
Have Equal Rights Under the Law  
April 24, 2023  
 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, Maine Family Planning is testifying toda y in support of LD 1412, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to 
the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law.   
 
Maine Family Planning was founded in 1971. That was the year before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
unmarried people had a right to contraception (Eisenstadt v. Baird, 1972). It was before the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act of 1974 guaranteed women the right to open a bank account or line of credit without a co -signer. And it was 
before Carol Moseley -Braun and Barbara Mikulski wore pants on the Senate floor in 1993, just thirty years ago, 
creating an uproar and changing the rules of decorum.    
 
Today in 2023, the hard -won rights of women and minorities are under attack, and it is an important time t o 
consider how states can best protect these rights. LD 1412 would give us a chance to enshrine equality protections in our State Constitution.    
 
We hope that you will vote unanimously Ought to Pass and allow this important piece of legislation to 
continue moving forward to a vote in the House and Senate and ultimately a vote from the people of Maine.    
 
Thank you ,
