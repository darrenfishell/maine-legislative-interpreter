LD 1412
 Thank you for your service in being my voice in our State Legislature.  I definitely 
want you to vote against LD 1412, because nowhere in it does it mention anything 
about respecting my religious rights.  
         
   The Amendment to the US Constitution, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), was 
passed in 1972, after much research and input from US citizens.  LD 1412 has not had
research and input from Maine citizens.
   The ERA already gives Everyone full protection under the law, with religious 
liberty for all.  Therefore, Maine needs no such Amendment, and it would infringe on 
the ERA.
Thank you for your attention to my message,
Marilyn Graham, Wells, Maine
