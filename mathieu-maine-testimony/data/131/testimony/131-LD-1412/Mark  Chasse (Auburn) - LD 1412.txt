LD 1412 ought-TO-pass as it will codify our rights as human beings to not be coerced
or required to show proof of vaccinations status.
It is a sad day when our constitutional rights can be overridden by laws or legislators 
with good or harmful intentions on sovereign citizens of this country at the behest of 
others. Apparently we have arrived at that day.
Thank you
