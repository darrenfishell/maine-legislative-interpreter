This is not a law about equality, it is a law about license that allows a person’s 
perceived beliefs about themselves to be accepted regardless of reality.
Laws for equality are within our Constitution, #5 and #14. They provide equal 
protection for both men and women.
Any law or regulation that permits or allows schools to pretend that biological males 
are females to allow them access to women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, is an unjust 
law. We have heard that there have been men who have assaulted young women in 
these situations. In high schools.
Biological men being permitted or allowed to participate in women’s sports has made 
a mockery of women’s sports. In some cases, these men have caused serious injury to 
women because of their greater strength. Every non-nucleated cell in a man’s body 
contains male DNA. They are bigger, stronger, and faster. There is no contest. It is an 
unjust law.
We are making women and girls victims in this system and perpetuating a lie in the 
minds of those who are trying to become something they are not and cannot truly be.
But you can show your support and value of individuals who are confused about their 
gender. Historically, we have shown genuine love and compassionate caring of 
individuals who were deluded about who they were by providing counseling and 
support as they worked through their confusion. 
By not passing this bill you will be providing an opportunity for these confused 
individuals to get the help they genuinely need. It is the most compassionate thing to 
do. Please vote no.
