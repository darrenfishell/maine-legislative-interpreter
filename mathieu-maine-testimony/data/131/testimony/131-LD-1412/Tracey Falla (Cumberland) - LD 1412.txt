Tracey Falla

LD 1412
My name is Tracey Falla. I'm a registered voter who lives in Cumberland, Maine. 
LD1412 is important to me as a resident of Maine and as an occupational therapist.
I see and believe in the importance for all people to be recognized as full members of 
our community within the State Constitution.  Laws can be changed and protections 
for human rights should be treated as foundational to our society.  The Constitution is 
that foundation.
Give voters a chance to act on this important legislation. 
For the people, Tracey
