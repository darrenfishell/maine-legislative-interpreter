LD 1412
LD 1412 RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine
Sen. Carney and members of the Judiciary Committee, LINDA HASKELL  in 
opposition to LD 1412. This is the same Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) bill
Rep. Lois Reckitt has promised to sponsor every session of the Maine Legislature
until it is passed. All the reasons why this bill is not tenable have been explained
every session. 
This bill is about abortion on demand, taxpayer funded, all restrictions off,
and LGBTQ special privileges not afforded those not of that persuasion. This bill  
defeated because it isn't about equal rights, it's about special rights for some and not 
for others. Our Constitution protects all individuals and treats everyone fairly. L.D. 
1412 would amend our Constitution unfavorably.
Please vote L.D. 1412 ‚Äùought not to pass" LINDA HASKELL, TO OPPOSE. ld1412
