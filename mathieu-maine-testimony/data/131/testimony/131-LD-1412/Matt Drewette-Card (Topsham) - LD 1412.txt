Matt Drewette-Card
Topsham
LD 1412
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Judiciary 
Committee, my name is Matt Drewette-Card. I am a resident of Topsham, a parent, 
and a lifelong educator, and I am writing this testimony on behalf of myself only and 
does not represent any views of official stances of any other organization for which I 
am affiliated. I am writing to provide testimony in support of LD 1412, “Proposing an
Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents 
Have Equal Rights Under the Law”.
Discrimination in any form has no place in Maine. As such, our laws should ensure 
that all people within our borders are protected and provided equal rights under the 
law. Intentionally including gender identity in the equal protections language in the 
Maine Constitution will ensure that “all” does and will mean “all.” The ability for an 
individual to achieve life, liberty, and property must be protected for all people within
the state of Maine, and people should not be discriminated against based on their 
actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or national origin. 
Everyone has this basic human and Constitutional right, and Maine is taking the right 
steps to make sure that all within Maine are provided these foundational and basic 
equal protections under the law.
I urge the committee to vote “Ought To Pass” on LD 1412.
Matt Drewette-Card
Resident of Topsham, Maine
