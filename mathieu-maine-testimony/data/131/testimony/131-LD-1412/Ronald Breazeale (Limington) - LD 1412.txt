LD 1412
I grew up in the South in a small "sundown" town. If you were Black you had to be 
off the streets by dark, you could not own property, and you could vote only if you 
took the risk of registering. Somehow in this environment I grew up believing 
everyone was the same, even though they were not treated equally. 
I married a woman most of whose family was killed in the Holocaust of  WWII. 
Since coming to Maine over 40 years ago, I have found this State to be a place where 
equality is practiced, not just talked about. I would encourage you to pass this ERA 
bill LD 1412. 
Sincerely
Ron Breazeale, PhD.
