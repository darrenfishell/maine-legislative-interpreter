Testimony of Laura Fortman , Commissioner  
Maine Department of Labor  
 
In Support of  LD 1412  
 
To the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
April 24, 2023  
 
Good morning, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary. My name is Laura Fortman, and I am the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Labor. 
While I am not able to join you in person at today’s public  hearing, I am submitting written testimony on 
behalf of the Department in strong support of LD 1412, “A RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to 
the Constitution of  Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights.”  
 
First, I want to thank  Rep. Lois Reckitt for continuing to bring this issue forward. Rep. Reckitt’s unflagging 
commitment to equality has been an inspiration to me and others across the state for decades.    
The Maine Department of Labor is committed to serving all Maine workers and b usinesses, regardless 
of gender, race, age, disability, identity,  or ethnicity. The Department works with employers to build 
inclusive workplaces and ensure that Mainers who have been typically left on the sidelines of the 
workforce have the opportunities and career pathways that lead to good paying jobs. Sending this 
proposed Constitutional amendment to Maine voters would be one step in providing foundational 
protections for all workers. When we prevent discrimination, we welcome the full participation of 
everyone in Maine’s workforce.  
Neither the Maine Constitution nor the U.S. Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, 
religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, 
ancestry, or national origin of an individual . Further, despite Maine laws that have been in effect since 
1949, and even though we are c ommitted to paying women fairly and equally based on their experience, 
their responsibilities, and their qualifications, wage inequality persists.  
As an example , states across the country recognize National Equal Pay Day, which symbolizes how far 
into the  year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year. This year, Equal Pay Day 
fell on March 14, 2023.  In Maine, the difference between median earnings for men and women who 
worked full -time, year -round in 2021 was nearly $10,000. The wage ga p is even more pronounced for 
women of color. According to the 2017 -2021  American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates , the five 
occupational groups in Maine with the largest wage gaps are: legal occupations; firefighting and

health technologists and technicians.  
To promote pay equality, Governor Mills signed legislation in 2019 to discourage employers from basing 
wages on an employee's salary history.  
Maine's Equal Pay Law  requires that employees be paid the same w ages as employees of the opposite 
sex for work that is of a comparable nature in skill, effort, and responsibility:  
• An employer may not discriminate between employees in the same establishment on the basis 
of sex by paying wages to any employee at a rate l ess than the rate at which the employer pays 
any employee of the opposite sex for comparable work on jobs that have comparable 
requirements relating to skill, effort and responsibility.  
• An employer may not prohibit employees from discussing their wages wit h coworkers.  
These laws are subject to the variable preferences of legislative majorities and governors, rather than 
the Constitution governing this state.  I urge you to support this Resolve and send this out to Maine 
voters. Please give them the opportuni ty to codify these fundamental protections.  
 
Thank you for your consideration.
