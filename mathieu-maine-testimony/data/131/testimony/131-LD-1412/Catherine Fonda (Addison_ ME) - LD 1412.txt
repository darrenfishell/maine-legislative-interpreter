LD 1412
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on 
Judiciary, I am Catherine Fonda of Addison, ME.
I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1412, RESOLUTION, Proposing an 
Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents 
Have Equal Rights Under the Law sponsored by Rep. Lois Reckitt of South Portland.
Article 1
Section 1 of the Maine Constitution:
Natural Rights
All people are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent 
and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and 
liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining 
safety and happiness. 
This quote from the Maine Constitution should suffice for all questions of equal 
treatment. In case other sources are needed there is the Declaration of Independence 
which says “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men (persons) are created
equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness”.  
Also the Federal Constitution Amendment XIV says “All persons born or naturalized 
in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United 
States and of the State wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law 
which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor 
shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of 
law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  
Why are such laws as 1412 needed today when the equal treatment of all is built into 
the fabric and laws of the United States of America?
