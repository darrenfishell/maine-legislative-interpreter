LD 1412
I am writing in support of LD1412m an equal rights amendment. This bill would 
make the Maine constitution the same as the Maine Equal Rights Act. I honestly 
cannot think of a single reason why this should not be passed. All people should be 
protected  based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or 
national origin of an individual. 
Thank you for your time.
