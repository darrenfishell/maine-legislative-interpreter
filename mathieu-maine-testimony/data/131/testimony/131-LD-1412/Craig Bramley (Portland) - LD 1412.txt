LD 1412
My name is Craig Bramley. I am a resident of Portland. I am writing to express my 
support for LD 1412 - RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution 
of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law.
I am an attorney and find myself recognizing that our views of rights are not 
necessarily protect in the ways we wish and are subject to change. 
I support the passage of LD 1412 because it is time for us to enshrine our shared 
values of equal rights in the Maine Constitution. Though the Maine Human Rights 
Act has been an important tool for protecting the rights of many Mainers, it is a 
statute and thus limited. The MHRA is subject to change with the political winds and 
is limited to the specific classes defined by the law. An equal rights amendment 
would provide a consistent constitutional backstop - guaranteeing equal rights to all 
Mainers even as legislatures and administrations change. It would fulfill the promise 
of Article I, Section 1 of the Maine Constitution that all people are born equally free 
and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and inalienable rights. Just over 
two hundred years after our Constitution was adopted, Mainers should have the 
opportunity to reconfirm this broad principle in an amendment that would affirm 
equal rights and dignity to all citizens of the State and protect these rights from being 
rolled back in the future. 
For these reason, I ask that you pass LD 1412 and let Maine voters decide whether to 
add the Equal Rights Amendment to the Maine Constitution.
