LD 1412
Maine is not the first state that is trying to pass this amendment LD 1421, so please 
look at the conversations that has occurred in other states like Nevada, i would urge 
you not to pass this bill.
This bill (LD1412) opens the door to government-mandated discrimination, 
inequality, and coercion. As discussed below, it would hurt women, religious 
organizations and schools, medical professionals, and could even mandate that 
taxpayers pay for others to receive abortions. ... By enshrining 'gender identity' in the 
state constitution, it would mandate that men who self-identify as women be allowed 
to compete for spots on female sports teams, womenâ€™s scholarships, and other 
academic and sports-related opportunities specifically for women. it would deny state 
financial aid to students at faith-based colleges and universities unless they abandon 
policies and practices reflecting their sincerely held beliefs about marriage and 
sexuality." 
"Courts in New Mexico and Connecticut have used state Equal Rights Amendments 
laws similar to the language in this bill to overturn state laws prohibiting taxpayer 
funding of abortion on the grounds that to not fund abortion is sex discrimination. The
rationale is that since abortion is a medical procedure sought only by women, laws 
treating abortion differently from other medical procedures is a form of sex 
discrimination. The same rationale will be used to expand and protect abortion".
This bill will create inequality and confusion and will eliminate protections and 
benefits women currently enjoy."
