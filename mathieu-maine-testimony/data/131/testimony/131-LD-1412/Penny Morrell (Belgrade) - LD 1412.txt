Statement by 
Penny Morrell 
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Regarding 
LD 1412 RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine 
Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law 
April 24, 2023 
Sen. Carney, Rep. l\/loonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you 
for the opportunity to present before you. l am Penny Morrell, taxpayer and 
citizen of Belgrade, Maine. 
lam opposed to LD 1412. This is the same Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) bill 
Rep. Lois Reckitt has promised to sponsor every session of the Maine Legislature 
until it is passed. All the reasons why this bill is not tenable have been explained 
every session. Yet, she seems determined to have it her way regardless of what 
Maine voters and citizens are telling her and any other legislators who support it. 
The ERA bill is about abortion on demand, taxpayer funded, all restrictions off, 
and LGBTQ special privileges not afforded those not of that persuasion. Across 
our country, this has been defeated because it isn't about equal rights, it's about 
special rights for some and not for others. Our Constitution protects all 
individuals and treats everyone fairly. L.D. 1412 would amend our Constitution 
unfavorably. 
Please vote L.D. 1412 ‚Äùought not to pass".
