A small number of people wrote Maine's original constitution in 1819. We need to 
include all of our voices in this foundational document if it is going to remain 
legitimate. Updating the Constitution maintains our Democratic ideals and social 
contract. 
Laws can be changed and protections for human rights should be treated as 
foundational to our society. The Constitution IS that foundation. We need the State to 
take more responsibility for working towards non-discrimination and this gives the 
needed basis for that. Without a constitutional amendment, the State can prioritize 
other interests ahead of people's civil rights at times.
