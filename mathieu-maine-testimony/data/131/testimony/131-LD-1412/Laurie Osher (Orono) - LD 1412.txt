the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
the
Judiciary
Good
afternoon
Senator
Carney ,
Representative
Moonen
and
esteemed
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher ,
and
I
represent
House
District
25,
which
is
the
majority
of
Orono.
I
support
LD
1412,
RESOLUTION,
Pr oposing
an
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
Maine
Establishing
That
All
Maine
Residents
Have
Equal
Rights
Under
the
Law
.
I
thank
Representative
Reckitt
for
her
leadership
in
the
legislature
and
for
again
introducing
this
bill.
This
resolution
proposes
to
amend
the
Constitution
of
Maine
to
prohibit
the
denial
or
abridgment
by
the
State
or
any
political
subdivision
of
the
State
of
equal
rights
based
on
the
actual
or
perceived
race,
color ,
religion,
sex,
sexual
orientation,
gender
identity ,
gender
expression,
age,
physical
or
mental
disability ,
ancestry
or
national
origin
of
an
individual.
She
knows
that
we
need
to
enshrine
these
rights
in
the
Maine
constitution.
I
experienced
anti-lesbian
discrimination
in
a
federal
workplace
when
sexual
orientation
was
not
included
in
protected
classes
in
that
workplace.
I
contested
the
discrimination-
which
included
so
many
transgressions
on
my
personhood
and
rights
as
an
employee
that
I’ve
blanked
many
of
them
out.
I
can
tell
you
that
the
transgressions
included
a
federal
investigation
of
“Lesbian
Activities”
where
Forest
Service
law
enforcement
interrogated
me
and
my
employees
and
went
through
the
personal
belongings
of
the
women
on
my
watershed
management
team
who
were
living
in
a
dorm
that
I
managed.
However ,
only
one
of
the
many
transgressions
against
my
rights
or
those
of
my
employees
in
the
workplace
were
contestable.
And
what
was
it?
My
supervisor
prohibited
my
girlfriend
from
coming
to
the
workplace,
even
to
the
parking
lot
outside
the
office,
because
he
claimed
that
it
created
a
hostile
workplace
environment
for
my
co-workers.
This
is
actually
illegal
because
she
was
a
member
of
the
public,
and
the
parking
lot
was
shared
with
the
visitor ’s
center
in
the
same
building
as
my
watershed
staff
manager
office.
My
brilliant
attorney
was
able
to
convince
those
reviewing
the
case
at
the
EEOC
that
I
had
been
discriminated
against
based
on
my
sex;
because
if
I
had
been
male,
no
co-workers
or
supervisors
would
have
claimed
that
my
girlfriend,
coming
to
pick
me
up
at
work,
created
a
hostile
workplace
environment.
We
settled
the
case
with
the
US
Forest
Service
agreeing
to
include
sexual
orientation
in
the
group
of
protected
classes.
Because
the
Forest
Service
was
part
of
the
US
Department
of
Agriculture,
the
USDA
also
changed
their
protected
classes
to
include
sexual
orientation.
District
25:
Orono
(part)

This
outcome,
which
went
into
effect
32
years
ago,
was
a
win
for
civil
rights
law.
But
we
can
do
better .
Here
in
Maine
we
shouldn’ t
rely
on
individual
people
who
have
been
wronged
to
take
on
the
establishment
one
transgression
at
a
time.
Here
in
Maine
we
should
protect
people
from
discrimination
now.
LD
1412
would
bring
the
protections
created
by
the
Maine
Human
Rights
Act
into
our
Constitution.
Of
course
we,
the
legislature
of
Maine,
should
support
this
proposal
to
protect
people
based
on
their
actual
or
perceived
race,
their
skin
color ,
their
religion,
their
sex,
their
sexual
orientation,
their
gender
identity ,
their
gender
expression,
their
age,
their
physical
or
mental
disability ,
their
ancestry
or
their
national
origin.
This
proposal
will
allow
voters
the
chance
to
decide,
which
is
a
very
important
step
for
Democracy .
Maine
should
join
the
thirteen
other
states:
Alaska,
California,
Connecticut,
Delaware,
Florida,
Hawaii,
Massachusetts,
Montana,
New
Hampshire,
Nevada,
Texas,
Virginia,
and
Wyoming,
that
have
amended
their
State
Constitutions
to
include
sex
and
other
protected
identities.
Maine
should
join
New
York
state,
which
is
giving
voters
the
opportunity
to
ratify
an
expansive
ERA
in
2024.
Please
support
this
legislation.
