Republican Cory R. 
LD 1412
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Judiciary 
Committee, my name is Cory Reynolds and I am testifying today in Opposition to LD
-1412 because itâ€™s just another liberal agenda trying to pass a bill taking away our 
American dream. 
This bill would hurt woman religious organizations and indoctrinate our young 
children to play on girl sports and be able to use the same bathroom, This is 
unacceptable and I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD -1412. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
