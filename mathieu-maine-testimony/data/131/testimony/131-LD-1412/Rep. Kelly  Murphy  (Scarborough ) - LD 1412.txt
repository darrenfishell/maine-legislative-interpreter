District 125: Scarborough (Part) 
   
Testimony of Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy supporting 
LD 1412, Resolution, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine 
Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
 
Good morning Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the 
Judiciary Committee.  My name is Kelly Noonan Murphy and I proudly represent House District 
125 which is part of Scarborough.  I stand before you in support of LD 1412. 
 
I left home early this morning with the intention of watching and listening to others speak to this 
crucial legislation.  I’m a big fan of human rights but a committed introvert. 
 
While waiting for the hearing to begin, I re-read Rep. Reckitt’s proposed amendment to the 
Maine Constitution.  It occurred to me that the people I love the most (my students and my own 
children) face a lifetime of potential discrimination.  I’m the mother of 3 neurodivergent 
children; one of those physically disabled and another who identifies as gender fluid.  I am also a 
1 to 1 special education Ed. Tech of preschool children with significant physical, mental and 
behavioral disabilities.  
 
I’m adding my voice to this cause on behalf of my twin daughters who are pursuing a college 
major dominated by men; for my youngest who has always known love is love; and for my 
preschoolers - may they never know the pain of institutional discrimination as they grow up. 
 
I thank you for your time and urge your support of LD 1412.
