Maine Green Independent Party P .O. Box 10345 Portland, ME 04104 (207) 200-6466 mainegreenindependent@gmail.com Testimony of MGIP Co-Chairs Lyn Maravell and Fred McCann In Support of LD 1412, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary April 24th, 2023 Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of LD 1421, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights Under the Law. We believe that all people regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or national origin are entitled to equal rights and that guarantee of such should be enshrined in the Maine constitution. While The Maine Human Rights Act provides some protection under the law it does not carry the same weight and constitutional supremacy that this amendment would grant.  As you may know, states such as Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming have amended their state constitutions to guarantee equality on the basis of sex and other protected identities. It is long past time for Maine to do so. We should be leading on this issue, not following. We urge you to support LD 1412 so that the voters of Maine will have the opportunity to declare that all people in our state are equal under the law. Thank you for considering this crucial resolution.  Sincerely, Lyn Maravell, MGIP Co-Chair Fred McCann, MGIP Co-Chair
