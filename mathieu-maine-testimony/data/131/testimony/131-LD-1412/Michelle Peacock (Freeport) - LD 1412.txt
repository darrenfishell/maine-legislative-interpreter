LD 1412
I urge you to oppose LD 1412, RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights 
Under the Law which was submitted by Representative Reckitt.
Both our U.S. and Maine State Constitutions already grant sufficient protection and 
promise of equality to all people, and the U.S. Supreme Court has already previously 
applied the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to women's issues. 
Additionally, there are countless other laws already in place covering practically all 
the bases, from employment and equal pay to
education and many other areas of life.
The ERA will not give women any more rights than they already have, and, if passed, 
it will significantly harm and endanger both women and children.
