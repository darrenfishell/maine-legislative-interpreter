Isla Drewette-Card
Topsham
LD 1412
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished members of the Judiciary 
Committee, my name is Isla Drewette-Card. I am a 14-year-old resident of Topsham, 
and I am writing this testimony in support of LD 1412, "Proposing an Amendment to 
the Constitution of Maine Establishing That All Maine Residents Have Equal Rights 
Under the Law". 
I am a feminine presenting youth who also identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ 
community. Because of my identity, I have experienced discrimination when in my 
school environment and around town. I have also witnessed situations where people 
are ostracized because of who they are, even though they have no control over factors 
such as ethnicity and religion. My goal is for the next generations of children to feel 
free to grow up without hiding any part of themselves because of fear. 
I therefore urge the committee to vote "Ought To Pass" on LD 1412.
