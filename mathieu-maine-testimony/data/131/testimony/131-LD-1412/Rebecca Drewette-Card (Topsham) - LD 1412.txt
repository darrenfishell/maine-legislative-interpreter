Dear distinguished members of the Judiciary committee,
I am a mother, a wife, and a small business owner in Topsham, Maine. I believe 
wholeheartedly that the proposed amendment guaranteeing all Maine residents equal 
protection under the law is important and necessary. As nationally we are seeing 
targeted attacks on women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, members of certain
faiths, and all racial and ethnic groups who are not expressly white, the time to pass 
this amendment is NOW.
