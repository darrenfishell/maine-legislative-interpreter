Testimony in Support  of LD 1440  Resolve, to Increase the Availability of Community Children's 
Behavioral Health Services by Providing Training and Career Opportunities for Behavioral Health 
Professionals .   
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and the distinguished members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
My name is Nancy Cronin , and I am the Executive Director  of the Maine Developmental 
Disabilities (DD) Council .  Creating a career ladder for direct service professionals is critical for 
the long -term health of the field.  Today, Maine Department of Health and Human Service 
contracts with a non -profit to provide  excellent Behavioral Health Professional training for free.  
Free is nice, but it isnâ€™t career preparation.  Career preparation includes college credits.  
 
In 2015 the New York Alliance for Careers in HealthCare developed a brief that outlines the 
variety of careers available and current issues in the field attracting and retaining a strong 
workforce. Each of the issues in their brief are issues that Maine experiences today. 
(http://nyachnyc.org/wp -content/uploads/2015/10/LMIS -Direct -Support -Careers -in-the-
Developmental -Disabilities -Field.pdf )  To provide care for the tens of thousands of people with 
Developmental Disabilitie s who live in Maine there needs to be a multiprong approach that 
includes a career ladder pathway and better training to reduce burn -out and turn over.  
 
Thank you for this opportunity to provide input .
