Sen/ices Resolve, to Increase the Availability of Community Children's Behavioral Health

LD 1440 
April 21, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Mary-Gene Rumeiy, and I ama 
resident of Norridgewock Maine. l am unable to be present today due to a recent injury. I am 
unbelievably happy that my voice will still be heard today. 
From 1998 to 2012 l worked first as a C.N.A , CRMA in charge of a residential behavioral health 
unit in a facility to eventually an MHRTC and BHPlll. My heart has always been in a position of 
care taking however in 2012 having met the absolute top of where my career could go and my 
income being capped l made the hard decision to reevaluate and ultimately leave the behavioral 
health workforce all together. The unfortunate tact is l am not alone. Every day more and more 
BHPs leave the Ô¨Åeld for other jobs that provide better pay with less risk to their own mental 
health. 
l strongly urge you to see the importance of passing LD144O to give 
Maine and its most vulnerable residents a fighting chance at having access to the quality 
behavioral health professionals needed to continue making this state a better place to live. 
Thank you for your time today. 
Mary-Gene Rumery
