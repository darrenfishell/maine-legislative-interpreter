Increase the Availability of Community Children's Behavioral Health 
Services by Providing Training and Career Opportunities for 
Behavioral Health Professionals 
April 21, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services, l am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of 
the Maine Community Action Partnership, the membership organization 
of the ten community action agencies in Maine, and we support LD 1440 
Resolve, to Increase the Availability of Community Children's Behavioral 
Health Services by Providing Training and Career Opportunities for. 
Behavioral Health Professionals.i 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people's possibilities. ln Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the often-overlooked potential in our communities. Through our Whole 
Family, or Two Generation, approach, we build a family's capacity for 
sustained stability and economic growth. We invest in the family’s well- 
being, we let them drive their own story, and we have tangible success. 
As these families fulfill their promise and make more money, which they 
do, too many ﬁnd that the job path they have chosen ends before it 
creates enough income to sustain the family at a level that allows them 
to leave State and Federal support behind. That is why helping to create 
career pathways like this, beginning as low barrier as possible but 
building to something sustainable, is so important. 
Creating or enhancing course curricula in community colleges allows 
those families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) services, for example, to attend school for step one, thento 
continue their education while working in that first level - while caring for 
their families. The option for grants, free or reduced tuition makes this 
even more appealing and inclusive. This curriculum could also include a 
layered approach, offering credit for “on the job" training, leading to the 
next step on the chosen career path. 
While one is a behavioral health professional (BHP), they can also be 
studying for social work; the on the job credit can be applied to the social 
work courses, for example. This offers a low barrier beginning to 
increase professional development, by making a BHP position the first in 
the pathway to better paying and professionalized positions. 
Thank you for your time and attention, I am happy to answer your 
questions if l can.
