Testimony of Raychel Ward 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
Resolve, to Increase the Availability of Community Children's Behavioral Health Services by 
Providing Training and Career Opportunities for Behavioral Health Professionals 
LD 1440 
April 21, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human services, my name is Raychel Ward, and l am a resident of 
Livermore Falls. I regret that l could not be there myself today but am glad to still have the 
opportunity for my voice to be elevated. l have been a Behavioral Health Professional for ten 
years in various companies and settings. 
As the minimum wage rose, the wages we are paid for providing services has not risen. We 
have people leaving this profession in droves because they can be paid more at Cumberland 
Farms or even Burger King. The ability to grow in other professions is much higher than that 
available to a Behavioral Health Professional. For those of you who are not aware, a BHP isa 
person who helps children develop coping skills, social skills and living skills in the least 
restrictive environment. Because we do not have enough BHPs, our fine state has been found 
to be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Failure to make positive change could 
result in more Department of Justice involvement. 
Our family has also required the services of a BHP for one of our children. As a parents, we 
waited almost a year for services and others have waited even longer. The fact our state does 
not put value in our BHPs is harmful to our children. Our children are our future, without them 
we have nothing. 
Thank you for your time and consideration to the importance of LD 1440.
