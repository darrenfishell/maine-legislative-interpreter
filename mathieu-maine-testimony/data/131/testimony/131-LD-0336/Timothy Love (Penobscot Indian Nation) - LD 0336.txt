LD 336, An Act Regarding State Recognition of Native American Tribes
Dear Judiciary Committee Members.
My name is Timothy Love, member of the Fisher Clan and former chief of the Penobscot Indian 
Nation, 1980-1986, and I am 71 years on this Earth. 
I am writing to declare my full support of the aforementioned LD 336 to establish a process for 
considering any indigenous group for 'recognition' by the State of Maine. My familiarity with who 
actually exists as a Native community in Maine is acute.
There is one historically established indigenous community that has not been recognized by the state or
federal government despite its long and well documented existence in the Moosehead Lake region and 
surrounding communities. That is the Maliseet Indian community today known as the Kineo St John 
Tribe (Wolastoquey) Our community at Penobscot has always recognized the Maliseets in the 
Moosehead Lake area. My family history goes back hundreds of years when our family at 
Norridgewock was burned out by the English in 1723. Our family sought immediate refuge with the 
Maliseets at Moosehead Lake and ultimately traveled to Burnurwurbskeek (Indian Island) thereafter.
As a child, my Indian Island family would visit our Maliseet Indian relatives on a regular basis 
in the summer months at Greenville and Rockwood. Many of these Maliseet community 
members married into the Penobscot Nation; Tomers, Bernards, Nicholas, to name a few.
My final observation is that this legislation is appropriate to ensure that one standard exists for the 
consideration of recognition by the State of Maine of Native American communities within our 
borders. 
Signed/ Timothy Love
