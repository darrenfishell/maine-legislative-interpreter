My name is Erica Caron, I am a Masters Prepared Registered Nurse for 18 years and a
nurse at a small community hospital and adjunct faculty with a local nursing program.
As these opinions are my own I will not be speaking on behalf of either organization 
or name them explicitly.  
I am very concerned about this bill; while I am all for safe staffing I feel it is very 
short-sighted and goes way to far to hamstring hospitals given the nursing workforce 
shortage and the post-COVID financial situation facing hospitals nationwide.  This 
bill could inevitably destroy local community hospitals such as mine who operate on 
shoestring budgets as it is, leaving members of the community without jobs and 
without care in a time when access is already a challenge in our area.  This bill would 
hinder progress as money for technological and capital advancements would need to 
be diverted away to staffing, and more specifically, traveling nursing staff that is 
already eating up hospital budgets.  My hospital is sitting on multiple open nursing 
positions and can't fill full time vacancies due to the state-and national nursing 
shortage.  In my nursing school role, many graduates state they don't want to stay in 
the Bangor area for a multitude of reasons.  I think money and time could better be 
spent looking at ways to develop our workforce and incentivize young people to stay 
in the area to provide the nursing staff we need.  This isn't a matter of hospitals not 
wanting to staff but workforce availability, community health (for example, impact of
violent patients with untreated mental health diagnoses on nurse retention), 
reimbursement structures and healthcare regulation that diverts limited funds away 
from the bedside into now-necessary administrative functions.  This is a systemic 
issue that cannot be fixed by excessive ratios.
