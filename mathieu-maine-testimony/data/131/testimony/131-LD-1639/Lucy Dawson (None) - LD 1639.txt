Remarks of Lucy Dawson, RN on LD 1639 
Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
May 4, 2023 
Hello. My name is Lucy Dawson. 
I have been a nurse for 21 years and currently I am a nurse in the emergency department at 
Maine Medical Center. 
lam here in support ofThe Maine Quality Care Act. 
I have seen the increase in stress and moral injury that occurs when nurses are stretched too 
thin. Many of my coworkers are leaving the bedside, because they are unable to give the care 
that patients need and deserve. We cannot be the nurses that we want to be when our ratios 
are too high. ln the critical care area, we have been increasingly forced to take on extra 
patients where we are placing 2 pts in a room designed for one. We are then forced to decide 
which pt gets the cardiac monitor and which doesn't. Determining which pt is the sickest. At 
that point we are just trying to keep them alive. The stress that this puts on the nurse is 
overwhelming. imagine going home at the end of the day knowing that you had to make that 
choice. To have this happen over and over again it is no wonder why nurses are leaving the 
bedside. I do not want this to be the new normal at Maine Medical Center and without this bill 
there is no guarantee that it won't. With appropriate ratios we can spend the time giving the 
care we should be giving. 
ln other parts of the emergency department it is not uncommon for each night shift nurse to 
flex up to an additional patient per assignment. With the professional judgement talked about 
in this bill it allows the nurses to make the decision to take another pt if they are able to. Nurses 
are no strangers to autonomy in provisions of care and we will continue to ensure the needs of 
the department. 
Passing this bill is the only way we can make our working conditions and the conditions for 
patients safe and therapeutic. Please support this bill and vote ‚Äùought to pass" on LD 1639, the 
Maine Quality Care Act." 
Thank you for listening
