LD 1639 An Act to Address Unsafe Staffing of Nurses and Improve Patient Care 
Testimony in Opposition 
4 May 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and Members of the Labor and Housing Committee, my name 
is Thomas Judge, the Executive Director of LifeFlight of Maine. LifeFlight is a non-proﬁt unique 
healthcare provider in Maine serving every hospital, EMS agency, and community in the state. Our 
LifeFlight nurses and paramedics are on the front line working both within our hospitals and on 
transport. We see the challenges of staffing our hospitals every day. We also collaborate closely with our 
colleagues across New England and the cotmtry with visibility into the complex issue of acute 
healthcare stafﬁng. 
We support the need to sustainably improve staffing in our hospitals. We do not know anyone involved 
in the front lines or in our hospital administrations that feels any different. We believe however this 
legislation despite good intentions will make an already incredibly challenging problem much more 
difficult with severe unintended consequences for patients and the cost of healthcare. 
While the chaos of bed availability is somewhat diminished from the height of the pandemic, we still, 
daily, encounter patients with hours and sometimes multiple days long waits holding in our community 
hospitals or major center emergency departments for an available critical care bed. Oﬂen the next open 
available bed is at a much more distant hospital in Maine requiring patient’s families to travel more than 
a hundred miles or more to support their loved one. On a regular basis the closest bed is often out of 
state. In the pandemic we were ﬂying patients from our rural hospitals downeast and in northern Maine 
beyond Boston. 
The immediate effects of the mandates included in this legislation will initiate a cascade of unintended 
results beginning with our major centers delaying admissions and diverting patients to more distant 
hospitals. This will increase holding times for critically ill patients in community hospitals awaiting a 
critical care bed in one of our major centers in Maine. The next cascade will immediately also place our 
community hospitals on diversion as they will not be able to accept new patients to meet proposed 
mandated staffing ratios. In addition, this legislation will immediately also place our hospitals in 
jeopardy of non-compliance with federal EMTALA regulations requiring at minimum admission fora 
screening exam and stabilization prior to transfer. The next cascade strategy for our community 
hospitals and major centers will be to routinely transfer patients outside of Maine in the search for an 
available bed. 
The next cascade effect, as we see nationwide, is patients holding in ambulances at the doors of 
hospitals waiting for a patient to be discharged so their patient can be taken in. This takes ambulances 
off the street and dramatically increases response time to emergencies. We are already struggling to staff 
our EMS agencies. This will add signiﬁcant pressure on the availability of emergency response and 
unscheduled inter-hospital transfers. The cascade is immediate gridlock across our entire system.

The cascade of effects will take us back to the height of the pandemic when physicians were sometimes 
calling seventy- ﬁve hospitals across New England searching for a bed. We spent two plus years trying 
to help our hospitals manage the gridlock across New England during the pandemic. This legislation will 
return and exacerbate the gridlock with patients being harmed rather than helped. 
The best of intentions will not improve the current situation and other elements of this legislation. We 
understand there are already ﬁfteen hundred open nursing positions in our hospitals. This does not 
include open and needed nursing positions in our schools, public health agencies, long term and skilled 
nursing facilities, and clinics. While we have made early progress with new nursing graduates entering 
the workforce we are seriously behind and there is no relief in sight in Maine, across New England, or 
nationally to our nursing and across the board healthcare workforce challenges. The newest data projects 
the already serious issues to become much worse. 
This legislation will dramatically increase the existing gap of open positions and cost of care. We cannot 
artiﬁcially increase demand when there is no viable option to increase the supply of healthcare 
professionals. 
In addition to the mandated stafﬁng challenges presented in the legislation there are other provisions that 
take us backwards rather than forwards particularly provisions in: 
" §1796. Stafﬁng calculation requirements: Sections 3,4, 6, 7, and 8; and 
I §l798. Use of technology: Sections l and2 
These provisions will also increase the already complex challenges of safely caring for our acutely 
injured patients, who are our family members and neighbors. We cannot solve today’s much less 
tomorrow ’s challenges with our current strategies. We need to reconceptualize our workforce, rethink 
scope of practice, and leverage technology if we are ever going to get ahead of our current challenges. 
We fully understand and acknowledge the need to do something dramatically different to protect 
patients and answer our current workforce challenges. All of us in acute healthcare want to solve the 
staffing challenge. Unfortunately, we believe, based on our and our colleagues experience, this 
legislation, despite good intentions, will harm rather than help those efforts and our patients. I am happy 
to answer questions.
