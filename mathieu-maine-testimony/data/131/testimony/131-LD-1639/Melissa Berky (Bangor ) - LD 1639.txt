Dear Labor Committee,
I am writing in support of LD 1639 Safe staffing ratios for bedside nursing. I give this
bill a very big thumbs up! Recently, I have been with my loved one through multiple 
hospitalizations. He was seriously ill in the hospital at EMMC. It is really horrible, 
anxiety producing, and dangerous to not have a nurse come in a timely manner. And it
happens a lot especially on nights and weekends and holidays. Please support this bill.
