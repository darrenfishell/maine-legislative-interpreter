LD 1639 An Act to Address Unsafe Staffing of Nurses and Improve Patient Care 
Testimony in Opposition 
May 4, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the Committee on Labor and Housing, my 
name is Lisa Harvey-McPherson I am a registered nurse speaking on behalf ofthe Organization of Maine 
Nursing Leadership (OMNL) and the Maine Nursing Action Coalition (MeNAC) in opposition to this bill. 
OMNL encourages networking, unity and collaborative partnerships among healthcare professionals 
across Maine. Our members include nurses in executive, manager, director and nurse faculty roles and 
nurses aspiring to healthcare leadership positions. 
The Maine Action Coalition is part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and AARP Foundation 
national future of nursing initiative. The Campaign for Action Coalitions in every state work to mobilize 
nurses, health providers, consumers, educators, and businesses to strengthen nursing on multiple 
fronts. The organization's goals are based on recommendations from the institute of Medicine's Future 
of Nursing report. 
I will focus on two speciﬁc topics in my testimony today. The history of nurse staffing ratio legislation in 
Maine and data on Maine's nursing workforce. 
Maine's nurses and nursing leaders have consistently opposed the inflexible mandates on nurse staffing 
described in all of the ratio bills because there is no meaningful data to support how state-imposed 
staffing mandates in hospitals will improve patient care or create more nurses. Here is a summary of 
the three previous nurse staffing bills in the Maine Legislature.

Resolve requires 
MHDO to adopt rules

measures of nurse 
satisfaction using 
national benchmark 
metrics. The Resolve 
also directs DHHS to 
issue rules to require 
hospitals to provide 
nurses annual notice of 
the Whistleblower's 
Protection Act 
The Resolve in 2001 may not appear to be a staffing ratio mandate bill. This bill was submitted shortly 
after California passed a law mandating nurse staffing ratios. During the many discussions I participated 
in regarding this bill supporters sought a pathway forward to mandate nurse staffing ratios. 
The l\/laine Quality Forum Advisory Council Report released in 2004 concluded that there is currently no 
reliable scientific evidence that mandated RN/patient staffing ratios are a guarantor of quality and 
safety of inpatient care. The report did recommend the collection and reporting of 15 nurse-sensitive 
indicators to the Maine Health Data Organization. This recommendation is reflected in the 2007 Resolve 
that passed. 
The conclusion of the Maine Quality Forum Advisory Council is consistent with analysis of the California 
law regarding the impact of nurse-to-patient ratios over time. In 2018 the Massachusetts Health Policy 
Commission issued an analysis of proposed staffing ratios. The report states that there was no systemic 
improvement in patient outcomes post-implementation of ratios in California.
This is further supported by data regarding the quality of health care in California. In 2022 the US 
Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Health Care Research and Quality issueda 
National Healthcare Quality Report. The report documents that Maine ranks in the 1“ quartile for best 
quality, California ranks in the 4"‘ quartile for worst quality.

U Missing 
ln the early 2000's when we were discussing staffing and Maine's nursing workforce it became clear that 
we needed data to describe the nurses in the current workforce and project out the future trends for 
nursing in Maine. Maine is one ofthe original states in the country to create the Maine Nursing 
Minimum Data Set. In partnership with the Maine State Board of Nursing, nurses answer a series of 
questions that in aggregate show us where nurses are working, their working status, education, age and 
if they are not working why. Today we are now part of a national data set collected by every state board 
of nursing. 
With over 20 years of data collection we know a lot about nurses in Maine. The trends are consistent, 
we are working, older on average than nurses in other states and nurses who report they are not 
working are caring for family, disabled or retired. ln 2012 we published a State of Maine Nursing 
Workforce Strategic Plan. The plan documented the need to project out the retirement cliff of Maine's 
nursing workforce. We had excellent supply data on our workforce, we needed to forecast the future 
demand trends. This became the next generation of our work. 
With grant funding support we engaged a national nursing data consultant, Pat Cirillo, and published 
our first nursing workforce report in 2015 projecting a shortage of 3200 registered nurses by 2025. This
served as a call to action for hospitals and Maine's nursing education programs to work together to 
increase the student capacity in our nursing education programs. Success requires more nursing faculty 
and more clinical placements in health care settings. Work accelerated throughout the State of Maine 
with partnerships focused on increasing the number of nursing graduates. In October of 2018 we worked with our consultant to monitor our progress and Maine's nursing workforce shortage of 3200 
RNs by 2025 was updated to a forecasted shortage of 2700 RNs. 
ln 2022 MeNAC and the Maine Hospital Association engaged our consultant to do an updated analysis of 
Maine's nursing workforce focused on the data trends from 2015 through 2021. We published the data 
and announced that we are making progress, Maine's nursing workforce shortage is 2250 RNs, this 
shortage is projected to be consistent through 2025. The report documents that the collaborative work 
statewide resulted in over 1000 new nurses younger than the age of 35 entered the workforce. The 
infusion of younger nurses into Maine's workforce results in the improvement in our workforce 
projection. A shortage of 2250 RNs is still a large number, but our work is producing positive impact. The 
report also documents that the workforce trends for nursing in Maine remain consistent, almost 9 in 10 
of the licensed RNs in Maine are working and the unemployment rate among RNs is very low at 1.9%. 
This is below normal limits for a full employed labor force. I have attached a copy of the report to my presentation. 
We also have positive information to share regarding the overall satisfaction of nurses working in Maine. 
On May 2"“ WalletHub published their annual update on the best and worst states for nurses. The 
results are based 20 metrics looking at two key dimensions ”Opportunity & Competition" and ”Work 
Environment ” . Maine ranks as the 2"“ best state in the country for nurses. California, the only state 
with mandated staffing ratios, ranks 23'“ . Here is a link to the article https:/f/waliethub.com/edu/best 
states-for~nurses§4041 
As l prepared for the bill before you today I reached out to the Board of Nursing for information on the 
current number of licensed nurses, as of April 3'“ there are 28,557 licensed RNs in Maine. 
0 84.5% Employed as a Nurse 
0 1% Volunteering as a Nurse 
~ 2.9% Employed not as a Nurse 
v 2.3% Unemployed — Seeking Work as a Nurse 
e 3.3% Not working (Disabled, Caring for Family) 
v 5.9% Retired 
Top Positions for the RN workforce are Staff Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses, these two positions 
represent 75% of the workforce, 56% of RN primary employment settings are hospital affiliated. Other 
employment settings for nurses include: 
0 Gerontology 6% 
v Home Health/Community 7% 
0 Hospice 1% 
v Occupational Health 1% 
v Public Health 1% 
0 School Health3%
The Maine Hospital Association estimates that hospitals are currently recruiting for approximately 1500 
RNs and projects that this bill will require hospitals to hire more than 1000 additional nurses to meet the 
staffing ratio mandate. As I have noted, data documents a shortage of 2250 RNs and the shortage will 
continue through 2025 given the intensity of nursing care required as we move through the post 
pandemic period. The number of additional nurses simply don't exist. 
l will conclude my testimony where I began - Maine's nurses and nursing leaders oppose the inflexible 
mandates on nurse staffing described in this ratio bill because there is no meaningful data to support 
how state-imposed staffing mandates in hospitals will improve patient care or create more nurses. We 
strongly urge this committee to vote this bill ought not to pass and join us in supporting workforce 
legislation and funding focused on nursing faculty and new nurse graduates.
