Testimony in Ogposition to LD 1639 
An Act to Address Unsafe Staffing of Nurses and Improve Patient Care 
Good morning, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder and members of the 
Committee on Labor and Housing. My name is Rick Petrie, and I am a Paramedic who 
has worked in the Maine EMS system for 42 years. I am now the Chief Operations 
Officer for North East Mobile Health, and I am speaking with you today asa 
representative of the Maine Ambulance Association. 
It goes without saying that our healthcare System in in crisis, and Nurses, like every 
healthcare employee, are overworked and stretched to the breaking point. 
However, this bill would be devasting to an EMS system that is already overtaxed and 
experiencing delays not only when moving patient between hospitals and other 
healthcare organizations, but also in emergency responses. On a daily basis, hospitals 
in Maine go on diversion because their emergency departments are overwhelmed with 
patients, taking ambulances out of the coverage districts and increasing the need for 
mutual aid responses. This legislation will significantly compound that problem, resulting 
in ambulance crews waiting in line to bring their patients in to the emergency 
department, or being requested to move even more patients out of the hospitals. In 
other parts of the nation, we have EMS crews doing the shift changes at the Hospital 
because the original transporting crew has been there so long waiting to deliver their 
patient. 
We sympathize with the plight of the nurses and understand the motivation behind this 
bill. However, the unintended consequences will have a negative impact on patient 
care, and the healthcare system will be further damaged if this legislation is successful, 
and we know that was not the intention of the sponsors. 
Thank you for your consideration, and I am happy to answer any questions you may 
have. 
Rick Petrie, EMT-P
