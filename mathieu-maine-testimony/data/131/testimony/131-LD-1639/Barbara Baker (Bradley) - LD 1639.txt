LD 1639
Dear Labor Committee,
I am writing in support of LD 1639 Safe staffing ratios for bedside nursing. 
Both my husband and I have undergone hospital stays at EMMC ant St. Joe's in 
Bangor in the past year. It was quite noticeable when nurses were understaffed, which
caused a lot of stress on the patient & family member who feels helpless & angry 
when that occurs. It is also just as obvious when competent, knowledgeable, and 
efficient nurses provide expert care. They brought us comfort, acted on our behalf and
recognized what help was needed to help us recover and thrive. Nurses need this 
support from lawmakers to guide management so nurses can do their jobs well; 
without burnout. Please vote "ought to pass" on this comprehensive bill which 
includes standards, audits, and sanctions.
