LD 1639
I am writing to urge members of the Labor and Housing Committee to support 
LD1639,  the bill in support of an adequate nurse-patient ratio.  As a more than senior 
citizen, I have many friends who have suffered extraordinarily from the lack of 
avaialble nurses at local hospitals.  At least one of those friends died prematurly 
because of it.  I urge you to support this bill.
