LD 1639
I am a nurse in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Maine Medical Center and have 
worked in this field for almost 30 years.  LD 1639 would not add any level of patient 
safety to the care that I provide to my patients.  As it currently stands, we are able to 
flex our staffing to accommodate the needs of the patient as demonstrated on that 
particular day.  If a patient becomes more ill, we can tighten staffing in order to 
provide care.  Sometimes, that means adjusting the staffing of less ill patients (having 
a nurse care for an additional "less sick" patient in order to free up a nurse to assist 
with a "sick" patient) and we have that flexibility now.  The effect of this bill would 
take away that flexibility.
