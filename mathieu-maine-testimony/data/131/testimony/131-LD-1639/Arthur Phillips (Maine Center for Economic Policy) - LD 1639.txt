improve Patient Care

Good afternoon, Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee 
on Labor and Housing, my name is Arthur Phillips, and lam an analyst at the Maine Center 
for Economic Policy. I am here to testify in support of LD 1639, which seeks to incentivize 
safe, reliable staffing for the benefit of nurses and patients alike. 
Common sense and economic research tell us patients are less likely to get the care they 
need when health care professionals are stretched too thin. But in recent years we have 
lost lots of hospital nurses as they have been exposed to trauma and burnout. As we 
emerge from the pandemic, we must invest in those nurses who have stayed in the 
workforce and find ways to attract more to join them. One critical way to do this is to 
ensure they are not overworked and understaffed, as this bill seeks to do. 
Studies have shown hospital staffing and patient outcomes are interconnected. One found 
hospitals with higher nurse staffing had 25 percent lower odds of readmission rates among 
Medicare beneficiaries, compared with otherwise similar hospitals with lower staffing. ‘ 
Another found each additional patient per nurse was associated with a seven percent 
increase in the likelihood of dying within 30 days of admission, a 23 percent increase in the 
odds of worker burnout, and a 15 percent increase in the odds ofjob dissatisfaction. “A 
study examining the projected impacts of proposed nurse staffing legislation in New York 
estimated significant cost savings resulting from reductions in length of stay.‘" 
20 years ago, California passed a law mandating nurse-to-patient ratios. Following the law's 
implementation, research showed improvements in both patient care and nurse retention. 
A 2010 study found that because of the law, hospital nurses in California cared for one less 
patient on average than in other states, with lower rates being associated with significantly 
less mortality. It also found little evidence of unintended consequences negatively affecting 
the work environment or patient care. Most nurses and managers reported the legislation 
achieved its goals of reducing workloads, improving nurse recruitment and retention, and 
improving quality of patient care.“ Another study found that from 2004 to 2008, the years 
immediately following the law's implementation, nurses were 25 percent more likely to be 
satisfied or very satisfied with theirjob overall. “ 
In recent years, Maine has lost nurses to burnout and exhaustion. This was of course an 
extraordinary period when our nurses faced extreme challenges due to strains on our

health care system. This bill represents a meaningful step to improve job satisfaction, 
recruitment and retention, and patient outcomes. We are hearing from lots of nurses, 
including the bill's sponsor, that this bill is their preferred method to achieve these goals. 
Based on the evidence, their expertise, and their service to our state, l think we should 
listen to them.
