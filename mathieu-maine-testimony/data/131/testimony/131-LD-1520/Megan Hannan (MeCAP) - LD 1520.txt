May 1 , 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan, members of the Committee 
on Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs , I am Megan Hannan, 
Executive Director of the Maine Community Action Partnership and we 
support LD 1520 Resolve, Directing the Department of Education and 
Department of Health and Human Services to Study Placing Child Care 
Facilities in Secondary Schools . 
 
Our state’s greatest resource is our people, and our state’s policies 
shape people’s possibilities.  In Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the hidden potential in our communities. Through our W hole Family 
approach, we build a family’s capacity for sustained stability and economic growth.  We invest in the family’s well- being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success.  
 
High quality early learning and care is the foundation of a child’ s life, and 
essential fo r pare nts returning to  work. Providing a child care  
environment for people w ho are t eachers and other professionals 
working in the  secondary education environment, as well as students 
and their families , is a way to no t only provide quality education, but also 
to allow students to lear n about early education and care, so that  they 
might enter the fiel d later. We know w e have a dearth of young people 
entering the field of early education and care, this can onl y help us to 
earn more.  
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
