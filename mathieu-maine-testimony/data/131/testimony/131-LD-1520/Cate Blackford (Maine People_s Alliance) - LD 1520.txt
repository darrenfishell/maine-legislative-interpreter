Good
morning
Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs.
My
name
is
Cate
Blackford.
I
am
the
Public
Policy
Director
for
the
Maine
People’ s
Alliance.
MP A
is
Maine’ s
largest
community
action
organization
with
over
32,000
members
across
the
state.
Our
mission
is
to
create
a
world
where
everyone
has
what
they
need,
contributes
what
they
can,
and
no
one
is
left
behind.
MP A
supports
LD
1520,
A
Resolve,
Directing
the
Department
of
Education
and
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
Study
Placing
Child
Care
Facilities
in
Secondary
Schools.
Maine
is
facing
a
multi-faceted
child
care
crisis.
Many
areas
of
the
state
are
child
care
deserts
1
,
where
there
are
more
than
3
children
under
the
age
of
5
for
every
child
care
slot.
W e
also
face
a
deep
shortage
of
early
childhood
educators.
W ages
are
less
than
what
people
can
earn
at
retail
establishments
and
fast
food
restaurants,
and
there
are
not
enough
opportunities
for
education
and
training
in
early
child
development.
LD
1520
would
study
addressing
the
lack
of
access
to
childcare
on
both
fronts,
by
exploring
the
establishment
of
early
childhood
education
on
high
school
campuses
in
Maine.
By
co-locating
child
care
facilities
with
secondary
schools,
it
would
examine
whether
we
could
potentially
create
new
training
grounds
and
pathways
into
the
field
for
educators
while
simultaneously
adding
locations
for
care
in
child
care
deserts.
This
is
a
solution
well
worth
studying.
I
urge
you
to
support
LD
1520
and
funding
it
from
the
Study
T able.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
