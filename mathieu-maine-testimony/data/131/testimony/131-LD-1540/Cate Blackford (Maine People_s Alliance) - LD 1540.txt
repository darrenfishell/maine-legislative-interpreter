Senator
Pierce,
Rep.
Gere,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Cate
Blackford
and
I
am
the
Public
Policy
Director
of
the
Maine
People’ s
Alliance.
MP A
is
Maine’ s
largest
community
action
organization,
with
32,000
members
stretching
from
Kittery
to
Fort
Kent.
W e
are
committed
to
creating
a
state
where
everyone
has
what
they
need,
contributes
what
they
can,
and
no
one
is
left
behind.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
today
neither
for
nor
against
LD
1540.
Y ou
have
heard
testimony
from
many
others
today
about
how
deeply
unaf fordable
rent
is
in
Maine
and
how
far
it
has
outstripped
wages.
I
remember
being
taught
by
my
step-dad
growing
up,
“Make
sure
one
week’ s
paycheck
covers
your
housing
costs!”
That
old
adage
isn’t
even
the
goal
anymore.
Instead
we
urge
people
to
find
a
home
that
takes
no
more
than
30%
of
their
gross
income.
Far
too
many
Maine
renters
would
feel
lucky
to
pay
even
that.
According
to
Maine
Housing,
41.5%
of
Maine
renters
are
cost-burdened,
paying
more
than
30%
of
their
income
on
housing.
Approximately
24
thousand
renter
households
are
paying
more
than
half
their
income
on
rent.
These
are
people
who
are
working,
older
Mainers,
and
people
with
disabilities.
W e
applaud
the
goal
of
LD
1540
in
attempting
to
ease
that
burden
with
a
meaningful
reduction
in
renter ’ s
monthly
obligations.
However ,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
bill
to
protect
renters
who
are
receiving
this
relief.
These
tenants
could
easily
have
their
rent
raised
by
$100.
$200.
$300.
Or
more.
I
am
sure
that
the
majority
of
landlords
would
not
profiteer
of f
a
program
designed
to
make
their
tenants’
lives
easier .
But
having
seen
the
recent
massive
rent
hikes
that
often
come
with
new
owners,
it
is
essential
the
legislature
protect
this
investment
for
its
intended
purpose
-
24
months
of
a
bit
of
breathing
room
for
renters.
Or
better
yet,
support
the
comprehensive
rental
assistance
and
reforms
in
LD
1710.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
the
thoughtful
work
you
are
doing.
