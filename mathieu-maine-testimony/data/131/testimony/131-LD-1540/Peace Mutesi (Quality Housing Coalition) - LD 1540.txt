                                          Testimony in support of LD 1540
I am Peace Mutesi and I work with Quality Housing Coalition.
I am testifying in favor of LD 1540- An Act to Create the Stable Home Fund 
Program. 
          
My reason for taking this position is because I work mainly with low-income single 
parent led households to stabilize their homes and the biggest challenge, they all face 
is paying their rent in full, on time. My clients and I worry so much about losing our 
housing/apartments because of the difference in what we can afford and the market 
rates. We are afraid of facing homelessness again with our little children. One of the 
single fathers we serve with a teen daughter has failed to find housing within the 
range of what is affordable for the two of them. What he can afford now he 
unfortunately cannot share a room with his teen daughter.
If this bill passes this single father will afford housing appropriate for his family. I 
and many other single parents will not lose housing and we can work more towards 
stabilizing our homes.
