Testimony of Frank D’Alessandr0, Maine Equal Justice 
In support of LD 1540 “An Act to Create the Stable Home Fund Program” 
April 21, 2023 
Good morning, Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Housing. My name is Frank D’Alessandro, and l am the Legal Services 
Director of Maine Equal Justice. We area civil legal services organization, and We work 
With and for people with low income seeking solutions to poverty through policy, 
education, and legal representation. Thank you for the opportunity to offer written to you in 
support of LD 1540. 
Maine Equal Justice supports LD 1540 because nonpayment of rent is overwhehningly the 
number one reason Why Mainers get evicted,1 and because our state is in a serious eviction crisis. 
rents continue to increase and the infrastructure and money that has been supporting many of out 
state’s most vulnerable has come to an end.2 This bill is an important ﬁrst step towards ﬁghting 
the eviction ciisis in our state, and ensuring all Mainers can live in decent and affordable housing 
\Vhat This Bill Does 
This bill establishes a fund, named the Stable Home Fund, administered by the Maine State 
Housing Authority, or a delegated municipality, which helps prevent evictions by paying up to 
$300 per month in rental assistance for up to 24 months directly to a landlord. Eligibility for the 
Stable Home Fund is limited to people with incomes that are less than 60% of the median income 
in the area and who are neither using federal housing vouchers nor living in subsidized housing 
when applying for assistance from the program.

Maine is Facing an Eviction Crisis 
In Maine, since 2000, median incomes have gone up only 14.6% ($59,571 to $68,316)? 
while average rental prices have gone up 104% ($ 647 to $1,325).4 The end of rental 
assistance and the unbridled rises in rental costs has led to at least 41% of tenants in Maine being 
“cost-burdened ” (spending more than one-third of their gross income on rent) and 20% of those 
being “severely ” cost-burdened (spending more than half of their income on rent).5 As of 2022, 
nationwide, at least 20% of renters are currently behind on payments.6 Add to this that Maine is 
somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 housing tmits short] and that nationally there is “less 
housing available for rent and sale than at any time in 30 years,”8 and it is clear that the 
necessary ingredients for an eviction crisis are currently being mixed together. With the end of 
rental assistance, with average rents increasing more than 14% year to year,9 with housing prices 
soaring, and with the seventh highest in-migration in the country between April 2020 and July 
2022,10 the eviction crisis has come to Maine. 
Evictions have very serious negative secondary effects. Evictions have been linked to 
psychological trauma and have been identiﬁed “as a risk factor for suicide? “ Those evicted have 
63% higher odds of losing Medicaid coverage, and getting prescriptions ﬁlled or storing 
prescriptions becomes extremely difﬁcult. 12 A housing change during childhood can lead to half

a year of loss in school.” Children that are forced to move three or more times generally have 
lower earnings, fewer work hours, and less educational attainment. 14 Children with unstable 
housing “are more likely to be truant, and are more likely to drop out”15 and they “are at higher 
risk for developmental delay, decreased academic achievement, anxiety, depression, behavioral 
disturbances, and even death.”16 These secondary effects are going to be felt more and more 
throughout Maine as iLl'l6 eviction crisis worsens. 
Evictions Disproportionately Effect Communities of Color and Women 
Black and Latino/a people “are more likely to be renters across income levels and are 
disproportionately represented in j obs with low wages, compotmding the damage of these rental 
unaffordability trends.”17 During the COVID-19 pandemic, “minority renters have been 
disproportionately affected by the economic effects” of the pandemic, like losing their jobs.” 
Black and Latino/a families are twice as likely as their white counterparts to have little to no 
ability to make rent each month.” Nationally, Black individuals constituted almost 20% of all 
adult renters but were nearly 33% of all eviction ﬁlings,2° and four out of every ﬁve black renter 
lives in a county Where landlords disproportionality ﬁle evictions against Blacks.” Black renters 
face serial eviction ﬁlings (eviction ﬁled repeatedly against the renter at the same address) ata 
rate of 14.9%, Latino/a have a rate of 13.2%, and Asians have a rate of 11.8%. All the while, 
whites have a rate of 9.8%.” Also, in general, Women are nearly 16% more likely to be evicted 
than men.” But, in particular, Black women are twice as likely then white Women to have an 
eviction ﬁled against them,24 they are more likely to have an eviction ﬁled against them that is 
dismissed, and they are the group most harmed by the current tenant screening policies that 
blacklist an individual with even a single eviction.25 Additionally, over 60% of Black women 
renters are cost burdened, making them even more VL1ll'l6I ‘2ll3l6 for eviction ﬁlings.“

Though the data in Maine is less robust,” the national trends are also found in Maine. In Maine, 
Black women renters are ﬁled against for eviction at double the rate of White renters. ” Indeed, 
Pine Tree Legal Assistance has reported that 12% of the tenants they represent in evictions 
identity themselves as people of color, though only 5% of Maine’s population is non-white. 
Similarly, Maine Housing data shows that 34% of Maine’s homeless population is Black or 
African American even though only 1.4% of Maine’s population is Black or African American.29 
It is clear that that the “threshold for ﬁling against white renters is higher than the threshold for 
ﬁling against black and Latin[o/a] renters. ”3° There can be no question that evictions are a racial 
and gender issue. 
Evictions Disproportionately Effect Children 
Renters with children are 17% more likely to be evicted than those without children.3I 
Additionally, renters Without children Who fall behind on rent have an eviction rate of 8%, but 
those in the same position with children have an eviction rate of 20%. This that statistically 
having children is “equivalent to falling 4 months behind in rent.”32 Additionally, the increase in 
children in a neighborhood correlate to an increase in evictions in that neighborhood. A one 
percent increase in children in a neighborhood increases the neighborhood eviction rate by 
6.5%.33 In neighborhoods Where children made up 25% of the population 1 in 18 renters were 
evicted. In neighborhoods With 35% children, 1 in 14 renters were evicted, and where children 
are 40% of the population, 1 in 12 renters Were evicted. 34 Children as young as 4 months old 
have been evicted. ” 
Landlords often view children as problems. Young children can test positive for lead poisoning, 
which can cost the landlord thousands. “ In disadvantaged neighborhoods, parents often require 
their children to stay indoors, and this can lead to noise issues and property damage.” Young 
Black and Latino boys attract the attention of police, which can lead to violations against the 
landlord.38 In larger cities, 15% of children have been evicted once by ﬁfteen years old. For Black 
children that number goes up to 19% and for Latinos that goes up to 17%, as compared to 11%

for white children.39 For children living in “deep poverty” (living below 50% of the poverty line), 
29% have been evicted by age ﬁfteen.“ More and more children are being listed on rental leases, 
and when they are evicted that will stay on their record (blacklisted) for their lifetime. “ This puts 
them at huge disadvantage for future housing. 
As stated above, children that live with housing insecurity deal with enormous ramiﬁcations for 
their education and their future potential. Childhood evictions in urban areas is a powerful 
predictor of lead poisoning.42A housing change during childhood can lead to half a year of loss in 
school.“ Children that are forced to move three or more times generally have lower earnings, 
fewer work hours, and less educational attainment.44 Children with unstable housing “are more 
likely to be truant, and are more likely to drop out”45 and they “are at higher risk for 
developmental delay, decreased academic achievement, anxiety, depression, behavioral 
disturbances, and even death.”46 
The Stable Housing Fund is a Good Start but Not Enough 
In Maine, 30% of all renters or 44,256 households have income below 30% of the Average 
Median Income (AMI) and our considered extremely low-income. 52% of these households are 
extremely rent burdened and pay over 50% of their income in rent. Severely cost burdened poor 
households are more likely than other renters to sacrifice other necessities like healthy food 
and healthcare to pay the rent, and to experience unstable housing situations like 
evictions.47Most extremely low income households are in the labor force, are seniors or are 
disabled. 48 For those renters, and for the many Mainers in similar positions,49 receiving $300a 
month for up to 24 months could help, but it will not be enough. By looking at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development ’s Fair Market Rent (FMR)5° and MaineHousing ’s Median 
Income data,“ it becomes clear how much more is needed to help renters in Maine. The FMR is 
“the 40th percentile of rent paid by people who have moved in the last two years in any given 
area”52 and it is defmed in federal regulations at 24 C.F.R. § 888.113.

rent (last visited Apr. 18, 2023).
By using the FMR the average price of rental units can be determined. With the average price of 
rent and with MaineHousing ’s data, calculations can be made for every county in Maine. The 
table below shows how much families making 30% AMI pay for an average two-bedroom rental 
unit in each county, how much receiving $300 a month would help that family, and how much 
more is needed to ensure a family at 30% AMI can afford the rent (paying 30% of their income 
on rent) for an average two bedroom rental unit. In every county, even with ﬂ1e Stable Housing 
Fund assistance of $300 a month, a family at 30% AMI would be paying between 58% to 75% of 
their income for rent. Furthermore, to make an average two-bedroom rental affordable to a family 
at 30% AMI, the amount of assistance that would be needed is between $727 and $1,188. This 
Stable Housing Fund is a good start, but we have a long way to go until all Mainers can actually 
afford a proper rental unit.

Conclusion 
Maine Equal Justice hopes the Committee will vote ‘ought to pass’ on LD 1540. Maine is in 
an eviction crisis and nonpayment of rent is overwhelmingly the reason why Mainers get 
evicted. This bill is a good start to ﬁghting this ciisis, and though we need more, it is better to 
have this than to have nothing. Mainers deserve to have decent affordable housing and this 
bill is a ﬁrst step towards that. 
We thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony and I am happy to answer any 
questions.
