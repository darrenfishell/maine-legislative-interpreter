Quality
Housing
Coalition
(QHC)
carries
out
its
mission
through
Project
HOME
programming
and
the
Maine
Housing
Equity
Project.
Since
2018,
Project
HOME
has
provided
over
550
households,
over
1265
adults
and
children
who
have
experienced
homelessness
and
housing
insecurity ,
with
permanent
housing
with
a
99%
success
rate.
The
Maine
Housing
Equity
Project
educates
communities
about
the
existing
systemic
barriers
to
creating
af fordable
housing
and
works
closely
with
community
partners
on
proven
solutions
at
the
local
and
state
level
in
the
areas
of
housing
supply ,
zoning
reform,
preservation
of
naturally
occurring
af fordable
housing,
and
housing
stability
policies.

According
to
MaineHousing’ s
2023
Outlook
Report,
“rental
home
costs
are
expected
to
continue
to
rise
in
2023,
compounded
by
both
inflationary
pressures
on
landlords
and
property
managers
and
a
private
and
public
housing
development
pipeline
that
is
being
dramatically
constricted
by
workforce
shortages
and
supply
chain
troubles.”

“The

is
$22,059,
compared

$27,008

Ther efor e,
it
is
likely
that
half
of
older
Maine
women
who
live 
alone
would
have
difficulty
covering
their
basic
needs

transportation,

expenditures,
especially
if
they
were 
in
less

are
over
twice

Employment
Needs 
●
According
to
Amanda
Rector ,
Maine’ s
Economist,
by
2030,
Maine
must
attract
75,000 
new
employees
to
meet
its
goal
to
“be
an
international
leader
with
a
vibrant,
sustainable, 
environmentally-
responsible
economy .”

Rental
Assistance
Must
be
a
Part
of
Maine’ s
2
year
Housing
Stability
Strategy
It
is
very
clear
that
without
a
stable
and
affordable
home,
employees,
students,
patients,
and
entr epr eneurs
cannot
achieve
their
potential.
And,
the
repercussions
of
having
unstable
and
unaf fordable
housing
are
crushing
debt,
eviction,
homelessness,
and
mental
and
health
care
crisis,
which
are
all
devastating
for
individuals
and
children
as
well
as
extremely
expensive
for
taxpayers
for
emer gency
rooms,
shelters,
and
jails
at
the
deepest
end
of
this
crisis.
The
dire
housing
situation
facing
Maine
people,
employers,
and
tax
payers
for
the
next
3-7
years
cannot
be
understated.
As
we
know
from
the
Maine
Af fordable
Housing
Coalition
report
cited
above,
evictions
dropped
significantly
during
the
time
that
Maine
residents
were
receiving
Federal
Emer gency
Rental
Assistance
(ERA)
funding
and
have
increased
to
pre
pandemic
levels
and
beyond
since
ERA
funding
began
ending
in
September
2022
and
finally
ended
in
December
2022.
While
the
Legislature
passed
LD
3
to
continue
funding
hotels
and
motels,
other
than
the
limited
number
of
federal
Section
8
vouchers,
there
is
no
program
to
assist
the
crisis
facing
Maine’ s
renter
workforce.
Accordingly ,
QHC
supports
an
approach
that
funds
limited
rental
assistance
that
is
tailored
to
Maine’ s
needs
and
takes
into
account
the
important
lessons
we
have
learned
from
the
administration
of
ERA.
The
Stable
Home
Fund
is
designed
to
be
temporary
in
nature
to
reduce
the
high
number
of
low
income
Maine
renter
households
facing
eviction
for
nonpayment
of
rent
whileMaine
is
working
hard
to
ramp
up
its
production
ef forts.
Although
only
156
units
of
af fordable
housing
were
built
to
completion
in
2022,
MaineHousing
predicts
that
nearly
1000
units
will
be
built
to
completion
in
2023
and
2024,
and
that
another
2500
will
be
built
in
3-5
more
years.
This
means
that
rental
assistance
in
this
form
is
a
temporary
fix
to
prevent
households
from
falling
into
the
deep
end
of
crises
while
the
State
is
working
on
permanent
solutions
that
increase
the
supply
of
housing.

The
Stable
Home
Fund
is
designed
to
provide
current
low
income
renters
with
an
additional
$300/month,
paid
directly
to
their
landlords
on
their
existing
lease.
Additionally ,
the
Fund
is
designed
to
be
simple
to
administer
to
existing
low
income
tenants
who
are
not
otherwise
receiving
rental
assistance
or
living
in
subsidized
housing.
There
is
great
ur gency
to
enact
this
policy
at
a
level
this
Committee
deems
appropriate.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
provide
this
testimony .
