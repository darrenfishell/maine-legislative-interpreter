LD 1540
I'll be brief. As the bill preamble indicates, Maine is currently experiencing a severe 
housing crisis, especially for renters. I'm lucky enough to be a stable homeowner, but 
no one can ignore the evidence of the housing crisis all around us. I urge the 
Committee to support LD1540 and vote OUGHT TO PASS, with its emergency 
clauses. Thank you.
