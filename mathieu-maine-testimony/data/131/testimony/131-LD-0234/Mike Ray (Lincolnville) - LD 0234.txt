LD 234 Testimony 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and Members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to speaks. My name is Mike Ray, and I live in Lincolnville. I’m speaking in support of 
LD 234. Here’s why. Two reasons: 
1. It simply helps some non-profits out in inﬂationary times, meet a crisis that comes 
up, or helps them in making out their budgets. While non-profits certainly fundraise in a number 
of ways, not every one is equipped to make that leap and rely solely on large donatons, or grants 
from major foundations. Some may need cash now, and not a lot of it at that. It might the case that 
creating a budget with 24 small fundraising opportunities gives them a better chance of performing 
their mission. So having that supper is, for many, just what it takes to keep on doing the work they 
do. Doubling their chances at having an event might be what it takes to keep some aﬂoat. 
2. There’s not a signficant cost to LD 234 as suggested by the fiscal note. The note also 
seems to suggest that the bill will not place a heavy burden on the DHHS budget in missing out ona 
few license opportunities. 
I can see LD 234 providing a boost to the smaller non-profits out there that will increase 
their impact on the communities in Maine. People need help sometimes, and these small outfits 
often do just that. I can also sleep well knowing that it didn’t cost the taxpayers much. 
Thanks for the time. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.
