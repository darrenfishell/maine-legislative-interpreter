LD 234
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Health 
and Human Services committee. My name is Paul Armstrong and I reside in Palermo 
in Waldo County.
I am testifying in support of LD 234.
The Present economy makes for tough times for people and businesses. Nonprofit 
organizations have suffered even more significantly since the onset of the pandemic. I
don't know the factual numbers but certainly thousands and thousands of Mainers 
benefit from the work of nonprofits every year- every day in fact.
It is with this in mind that I, and many others, feel that nonprofits should be allowed 
to raise funds more often than presently legally allowed through public events and 
meals. The struggle for funding is real. The need for nonprofit services is real. 
I personally use the Waldo County Wood Shed to help with my home heating since 
the date of LiHeap distribution is generally unknown in advance and makes it hard to 
make sure one has resources to stay warm. Services like the Waldo County Wood 
Shed are a Godsend to low income people like me. These organizations should be 
allowed to sponsor fund raising as they see necessary and not restricted by limitations 
on how often they may hold a fund raising event.
I thank you for your time and consideration and respectfully ask for your support on 
the passing of this bill- LD 234
