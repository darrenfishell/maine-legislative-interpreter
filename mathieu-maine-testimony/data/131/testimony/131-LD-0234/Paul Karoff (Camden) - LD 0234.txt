Honorable Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services, Maine Legislature,
I write in support of LD 234 - An Act to Raise from 12 to 24 the Annual Limit on the Number of Public 
Events and Meals Nonprofit Organizations May Have That Are Exempt from Certain Rules and 
Regulations.
LD 234 proposes a modest adjustment to allow tax-exempt non-profit 501(c)3 organizations to sponsor 
up to two fundraising events per month rather than one as is permitted under current regulations. 
I am a volunteer at Waldo Woodshed, an entirely volunteer-staffed wood bank providing fuel assistance 
to needy families in more than a dozen towns throughout Waldo County. This winter, demand for 
firewood for household heating is dramatically higher than in the past, outstripping Waldo Woodshed’s 
capacity to purchase logs for processing into firewood. To supplement its reserves, Waldo Woodshed 
has organized monthly dinners. 
These events, staffed by volunteers, relying on donated food items, and providing nourishing meals on a 
pay-what-you-can-afford basis, are important for two reasons:
they provide much-needed income to defray the costs of maintaining wood bank operations; and
they are an opportunity for diverse individuals to come together in a spirit of community and 
common purpose. 
Waldo Woodshed, and many other non-profits providing valuable services to our fellow citizens, will 
benefit greatly from adoption of LD 234 and I urge to support its enactment.
Thank you for your consideration.
