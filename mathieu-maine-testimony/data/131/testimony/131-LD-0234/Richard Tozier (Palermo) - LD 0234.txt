LD 234
I am writing in support of LD234, as presented by Representative Stanley Paige 
Ziegler of Montville.  The bill doubles, from 12 to 24, the number of public events 
and meals within one calendar year nonprofit organizations may have that are exempt 
from Department of Health and Human Services rules and regulations relating to 
distributing food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This bill will improve the opportunity for nonprofit organizations to generate funding.
It is hard to imagine how merely doubling the number of events from 12 to 24 could 
pose any competitive threat to for-profit entities.   The bill's passage and 
implementation will also not stress the allotted budget for the DHHS. 
As a volunteer in the Waldo County Woodshed, I can appreciate the need the organization 
has to acquire wood and to maintain fuel and repairs to its equipment.   Expanding its source 
of financing would be a major help.
It is easy to understand how this would apply to other nonprofit organizations.
May LD 234 be presented and pass.
