Honorable Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services, Maine Legislature,
I write in support of LD 234 - An Act to Raise from 12 to 24 the Annual Limit on the Number of Public 
Events and Meals Nonprofit Organizations May Have That Are Exempt from Certain Rules and 
Regulations.
LD 234 proposes a modest adjustment to allow tax-exempt non-profit 501(c)3 organizations to sponsor 
up to two fundraising events per month rather than one as is permitted under current regulations. 
I am the founder of the Waldo County Woodshed, an entirely volunteer-staffed wood bank providing 
fuel assistance to needy families in the midcoast region. We raise money to purchase logs from local 
loggers, buy and maintain equipment, and cover the usual expenses such as insurance, fuel, and 
supplies. Last season we served over 180 families. We recently started organizing monthly “Pay What 
You Can Dinners” as a new fundraising event, and these have proven very popular. 
These events, staffed by volunteers, relying on donated food items, and providing nourishing meals on a 
pay-what-you-can-afford basis, are important for two reasons:
they provide much-needed income to defray the costs of maintaining wood bank operations; and
they are an opportunity for diverse individuals to come together in a spirit of community and 
common purpose. 
We see these dinners as a vital component of our fundraising program, and would like to expand our 
schedule but are currently limited by law to (12) events per year. Please consider supporting our efforts 
by passing LD 234.
Thank you for your consideration.
