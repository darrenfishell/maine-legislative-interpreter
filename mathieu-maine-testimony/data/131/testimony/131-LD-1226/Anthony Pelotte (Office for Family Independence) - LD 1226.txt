Re: LD 1226  – An Act to Require MaineCare to Give a 60 -day Notice Prior to Terminating 
Benefits  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee o n 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide you with information that might be helpful to you  in your deliberations 
regarding LD  1226.  This Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services to notify a 
MaineCare member 60 days prior to t erminating benefits under the MaineCare program.   
 
Federal statute requires states to provide a minimum notification  to MaineCare members prior to 
terminating benefits1. Currently the Department provides a minimum notice of 15 days prior to 
terminating coverage2. This bill  would  allow all MaineCare members to retain coverage  for an 
additional 45 or more days past their date of determination  of ineligibility . It is uncle ar if the 
intent of this bill is to extend eligibility or if it is strictly to ensure a longer time frame from  
notification to termination of coverage.  As written, this bill would  extend eligibility. From the 
program perspective , operationally  and technica lly, it is not possible to make a  termination 
decision  for a time period further out than the month following that decision. Currently a 
MaineCare eligibility determination, whether based on an application, renewal , or change is made 
for either the current  month (if the decision is made at the beginning of the month) or for the 
month following the month of decision  (for decisions made in the second half of the month) .  
 
This proposal would risk federal funding and require significant state funding to support the  
resulting  eligibility extens ions. The impact of this bill as written  (especially for applicants3 ) 
would require state funding  to support the extension of eligib ility prior to termination . Federal 
funding is limited to the end of the month that eligibility  is provided absent a renewal4.  
 
 
 
1 42 C.F.R. § 431.211  describes Advance notice.  
2 Chapter 332 , Part 2, Section 15:  NOTICES  
3 Title 22 § 3173 application decisions must be made as soon as possible  
4 42 C.F.R. §  435.916(a)(1) Periodic renewal of Medicaid eligibility explains the requirement to renew coverage 
once every 12 months.  
 
 
 
 Implementation of this bill would require rule making and significant technology changes that 
would require 24 months or more  given existing work .  
 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you  consider this bill going forward. If 
you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Anthony Pelotte, Director  
Office for Family Independence
