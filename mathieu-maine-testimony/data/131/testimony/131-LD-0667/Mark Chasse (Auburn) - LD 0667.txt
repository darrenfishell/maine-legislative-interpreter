LD 667
LD 667 ought-NOT-to pass as it is a regressive tax with unintended consequences. 
What will be the net loss in revenue for those people in that tax bracket who will 
move their primary residences to another state, or will protect their assets in using 
other tax shelters. 
In the end directed funding to programs will be paid for by those in need of the funds.
Thank you
