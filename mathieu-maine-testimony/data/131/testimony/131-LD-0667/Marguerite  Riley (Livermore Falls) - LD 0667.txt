LD 667
Dear Senator, Representative and Taxation Committee members,
I am writing to express to vehement opposition to two bills concerning raising taxes. These 
bills are LD667 and LD843. Maine is already 3rd highest tax rate in the Nation. 
We do not want our tax dollars used on social, emotional and race/ gender issues- use it 
toward reading, writing and math.  We also do not want illegal immigrants funded with our 
hard earned tax money.  Food, electricity and shelter already has increased for we citizens of 
Maine. No new taxes by means of these 2 bills.  I humbly submit my request.
