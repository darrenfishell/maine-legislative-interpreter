LD 667
Dear Congressman, Representative and Taxation committee members, We implore 
you vote against LD 667 regarding certain Mainer's incomes getting surcharged. 
Maine is the third highest taxed state in our nation. Hard working legally documented 
citizens do not deserve this. Thank you for your time.
