RE Bloom Testimony in Support of LD 1887, An Act to Clarify the Review and Procurement 
Process for Nonwires Alternanves 
Dear Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and members of the Energy, Utilities, and Technology 
Committee 
Good afternoon, my name IS Jordan Garfinkle l'm with Bloom Energy —thank you to the committee for 
allowing me to testify today I'm testifying in support of LD 1887 and I want to share a bit about how 
distributed energy resources, as a non-wires alternative, can strengthen the grid at lower costs than 
traditional infrastructure upgrades 
Bloom IS a distributed energy company that makes solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers Fuel cells 
generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction at very high efficiency without combustion 
Bloom has been installing our fuel cells since 2008, and we currently have over t gigawatt of capacity 
installed around the world Many of our customers have a high need for reliability and resilience, like 
healthca re facilities and data centers We've also worked directly with utilities to meet their own 
reliability needs and alleviate grid constraints 
This bill acknowledges that non-wires alternatives can provide significant cost savings over traditional 
transmission upgrades, and that a range of solutions can ﬁt that need Distributed generation can bea 
central piece of NWA by providing localized generation in constrained areas 
Bloom has experience providing non-wires alternatives, and we've done’this in COl'1jL|l"lC ’ElOn with other 
technologies to offset the need for costly upgradesX 
For example, in New York City, we participated in the Brooklyn Queens Demand Management Initiative 
Here, the utility had identiﬁed a capacity shortfall that would have required an estimated $1 2 billion in 
traditional "poles and wires" upgrades Instead, they looked at non-wires alternatives - we worked with 
Con Edison, the local utility, to install fuel cells at hospitals, state agencies, and a low-income housing 
development These pl"Oj€C’[S alongside solar and battery systems met the local need for about $200 
million - avoiding infrastructure investments and saving ratepayers nearly $1 billion

When done thoughtfully, distributed generation can also offer additional beneﬁts not available from 
transmission upgrades In the New York City example, one of our systems was conﬁgured as a microgrid, 
meaning that the facility was protected against power outages If the generation IS sited strategically, the 
utility’ can provide localized resilience in high risk or low reliability zones by generating power precisely 
where it's needed This lS not something you can do when you bring in power over a transmission line 
Our fuel cells also provide a grid service called volt/VAR support and frequency regulation, which 
enhance reliability and help improve power quality 
There's also a timing component that can provide additional value As you know, transmission projects 
take years to study, permit, build and come online To the extent that certain needs, like capacity 
shortfalls, need to be addressed in the short-term, DG can provide a S0|U'lTIO|'l several years sooner 
These are all characteristics of non—wires alternatives that can beneﬁt the grid, often at lower cost than 
traditional infrastructure upgrades 
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of LD 1887 
About Bloom Energy 
Bloom Energy is a manufacturer of solid oxide fuel cell technology that utilizes an electrochemical 
process to power non-combustion microgrids as well as advanced electrolyzer systems capable of 
converting renewable electricity into renewable hydrogen Our solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers are 
designed in a modular fault-tolerant format that provides mission critical reliability with no downtime for 
maintenance Bloom Energy has installed around 1,000 of its non-combustion solid oxide fuel cell 
systems for customers in thirteen U S states and several international locations, with approximately 100 
operating in New England Our systems have proven resilient through outages caused by hurricanes, 
winter storms, earthquakes, forest ﬁres, and other extreme weather and natural disasters
