Testimony of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1887, An Act to Clarify the Review and Procurement Process for 
Nonwires Alternatives 
May 16, 2023 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, and Distmgiiished Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Energy, Utihties, and Technology (Committee), my name is Deirdre Schneider, testifying neither for 
nor against LD 1887, An Act to Clarify the Review and Procurement Process for Nonwires Alternatives 
on behalf of the Public Utilities Commission (Commission) 
The Commission understands that one of the main purposes of this bill it to make clear that proposals 
from a utility regarding substations are also SL1l)_]6Cll to the nonwires alternative process The 
Commission does not have an issue with the inclusion of substations, but notes that the language m the 
bill, speciﬁcally in Section 7 may need to be clanﬁed Also, Section 13 requires, when the Commission 
deteimines a nonwires altemative is appropnate, that “the nonwires alternative must be competitively 
procured ” The Commission m conversations with the Office of the Public Advocate (OPA) agreed 
that it may better align with existing law to specify that the nonwires altemative must be prudently 
procured The Comrmssion is currently working with the OPA to clarify these two issues and hopes to 
have additional conversations with stakeholders We are available to help with amended language for 
the Comrnittee ’s consideration in advance of the work session 
The Commission anticipates that it will open a proceeding to examine the nonwires alternative process 
to see if improvements can be made to this process, including building in more efﬁciencies 
Additionally, the nonwires altemative process will be part of the discussions in the grid planning 
proceedingl that 1S currently ongoing at the Commission 
I would be happy to answer any questions or provide additional information for the work session
