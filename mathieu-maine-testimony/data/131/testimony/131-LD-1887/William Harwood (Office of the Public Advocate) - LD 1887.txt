Central Maine Power’s 
(CMP) transmission line in 
the Brunsw|cklTopsham 
area (Section 31) 
NWA Ratepayer savings are 
proiected to be $9,927,77I The NWA Coordinator (NWAC) identified a cost-effective alternative 
to rebuilding Section 31 This NWA removes a section of the 
transmission line and Brunswick Westside substation lt includes 
upgrades to the local system to improve reliability plus investments 
in energy storage and energy efﬁciency to support the system if there 
is a loss of a major system component during periods of highest 
summer use 
CMP‘s substation pl'Oj6C'( in 
Limerick 
NWA Ratepayer savings are 
estimated to be 
$5,000,000 CMP determined a substation transformer was becoming overloaded 
during periods of highest summer use The system had insufﬁcient 
back-up capability if a transformer failed The NWAC reviewed 
CMP’s study assumptions and models for CMP’s proposed solution 
to determine if a more cost-effective NWA was available During the 
NWAC review, CMP found an alternative solution using existing 
inventory that could more quickly and cost-effectively address the 
current overloading during normal operations The only cost was the 
additional labor to install the backup transformer 
CMP’s transmission line in 
the Sanford Area, (Section 
113) 
NWA Ratepayer savings are 
estimated to be 
$5,400,000 CMP conducted a cluster study in the Sanford Area to measure the 
impact of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) proposed for 
interconnection CMP identiﬁed a system overload condition Upon 
reviewing the assumptions used in the cluster study, the NWAC 
determined that the overload would only occur after DER 
interconnection Therefore, ratepayers were not responsible for the 
upgrades needed for DER in this area 
CMP’s transmission line in 
the Lewistown Area, 
(Section 76) 
NWA Ratepayer savings are 
pro|ected to be $2,000,000 
to $3,500,000 The NWAC determined that there is a technically feasible and cost— 
effective NWA to reduce existing overloads on Section 76 The NWA 
will support DER interconnections until a complete line upgrade 
takes place The NWA saves ratepayers $2,377,208 to $3,578,865 
based on the deferral of the revenue requirements for three to ten 
years
