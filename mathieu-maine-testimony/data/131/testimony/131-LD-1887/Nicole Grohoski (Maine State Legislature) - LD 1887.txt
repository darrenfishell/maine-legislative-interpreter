THE MAINE SENATE 
131st Leglslature 
Testimony of Senator Nicole Grohoskl 
In Support of LD 1887, “An Act to Clarlfy the Rev1ew and Procurement 
Process for Nonwires Alternatlves ” 
Before the Commlttee on Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Technology 
16 May 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Lawrence, Representat1ve Ze1gler, and fellow members of the J o1nt 
Standmg Comrmttee on Energy, Ut1l1t1es and Technology As you know, my name 1s Nlcole 
Grohosk1 and I am honored to represent the 22 commumt1es of Senate D1str1ct 7 I am here 1n 
support of LD 1887, “An Act to Clanfy the Revlew and Procurement Process for Nonw1res 
A1ternat1ves” 
In 2019, the Leg1slature establ1shed a Nonw1res Alternat1ve (NWA) po11cy (LD 1887) to 
mdependently assess whether proposed ut111ty upgrades of a certa1n s1ze were necessary or could 
be done more affordably through alternat1ve solut1ons An example of such a solutlon would be 
mstalhng targeted generat1on, battery storage, or energy efﬁc1ency measures downstream ofa 
substatlon rather than bu1ld1ng a b1gger l1ne and a b1gger substat1on to serve an area dunng 
penods of peak demand The Nonw1res Alternanve Coord1nator1s contracted by the Ofﬁce of the 
Publ1c Advocate, who has an 1mportant role 1n help1ng manage ratepayer costs for expand1ng our 
d1str1but1on and transm1ss1on system 
Ma1ne’s NWA po11cy 1s cons1dered a model for other states, yet we are not see1ng the pol1cy 
reach 1ts full potent1a1 here at home Th1s b1ll addresses 1ssues that have cropped up over the past 
few years of 1n:1plementat1on Spec1ﬁcally 1t does the followmg 
0 S1mpl1ﬁes two deﬁn1t1ons 1nto one (nontransm1ss1on alternat1ve and nonw1res a1ternat1ve) 
0 Clanﬁes that energy storage 1s a type of nonwlres alternat1ve 
I Clanﬁes what parts of the gr1d are SL1b_]€Ct to NWA rev1ew, spec1ﬁcally that substat1on 
upgrades and replacements proposed by the ut1l1t1es requ1re NWA evaluat1on 
0 Allows the OPA to br1ng an NWA d1spute to the PUC, as the ut1l1t1es can already do 
0 Spec1ﬁes that CMP’s and Versant’s ab1l1ty to request a protect1ve order for NWA 
eva1uat1on only appl1es to customer data or cr1t1ca1 energy mfrastructure rnformatron 
I Requlres that NWAs are compet1t1vely procured to ensure that the most cost-effecnve 
NWA solutlon, be 1t th1rd-party owned or ut111ty-owned, 1s funded by ratepayers

CMP’s ongomg rate case has provlded clear ev1dence of the need to reﬁne our NWA pol1cy In 
the rate case proceedmg, CMP has argued that planned mvestments 1n 1ts substat1ons are exempt 
from NWA revlew — yet alternatrves to upgradmg a substat1on ’s capac1ty for a l1m1ted number of 
peak hours each year can be great opportumtles to save ratepayer dollars 
The Company’s drstnbutron capltal spendrng plan proposed 1n the rate case mcluded nearly $90 
m1ll1on over the next four years focused on upgradlng system capacrty for peak load penods For 
example, CMP 1s proposmg nearly $13 m1ll1on to upgrade the prnnary substat1on servlng South 
Portland due the c1ty’s electrlﬁcatlon goals Th1s p1'O_]CC'E has been grven no NWA revlew, desp1te 
the fact that targeted battery storage deployment and load management on hot summer days 
could potentlally provrde substantral value to ratepayers by helpmg defer the mvestment need 
In the proceedmg, CMP argued that these p1'O_]6CtS are exempt from NWA revlew because they 
1nclude substatlo-n components, desp1te the fact that the statute clearly states that the role of an 
NWA 1s that 1t “defers or reduces the need for cap1tal rnvestment 1n the transm1ss10n and 
d1str1but1on system ”‘ I don’t understand how you can have a transm1ss10n and dlstrlbutron 
system wlthout a substat1on at the mterfacel 
The rate case also showed the need for ensur1ng competltlve sohcrtatron of NWAs The law 
currently grves CMP and Versant sole control of procunng NWAs 1f they voluntanly propose a 
front-of-the-meter NWA solutron In the rate case, CMP shrelded the development of 1ts 
ut1l1ty-owned battery storage proposals at the Trap Corner substatlon and the WOOlW1Ch 
substatron from the NWA Coordrnator, OPA, and Efﬁclency Mame untrl 1ts 1n1t1al ﬁhng Th1s 
prevented any conslderatlon of whether the capaclty upgrades proposed at each substatlon could 
be met more cost effectrvely by thrrd-party owned battery storage or other th1rd-party NWAs 
solutrons rather than ut1l1ty-owned battery storage The Legrslature needs to ensure that the PUC 
assesses wh1ch entrty can delrver the most cost-effectrve NWA solutron for ratepayers 
Ultrmately, the ut1l1t1es may operate front-of-the-meter battenes 1n an NWA appl1cat1on, but they 
do not need to develop, ﬁnance, and own the battenes 1n order to do so 
Lrke Sen Vltelh (re LD 1850), I th1nk energy storage has a role to play 1n Mame NWAs are the 
approprlate, most cost-effectrve mechanrsm for developmg more battenes 1n Mame 1n the near 
term As a regron, we have ample generatron capacrty for the next decade, so batter1es are not 
needed for supply, nor do we need them to balance renewable generatlon for gnd rel1ab1l1ty at 
th1s early stage of our energy trans1t1on The best Way for Mame to support cost-effectrve 
mvestment 1n battery storage 1s to employ battenes 1n nonwrres alternatlves solut1ons The 
clarrﬁcatlons made by th1s b1ll w1ll support consrderatron of batterles as NWA SOlU.'£1OI1S 
Thank you for your attentron and I am happy to answer any questrons you may have
