Testlmony of Competitlve Energy Services 
In Support of LD 1887, “An Act to Clarify the Revlew and Procurement Process for 
Nonwlres Alternatives ” 
Before the Commlttee on Energy, Utlhtles and Technology 
16 May 2023 
Good afternoon My name 1s Eben Perkms, and I am pleased to be here today speaklng on behalf of 
Competltlve Energy Servlces CES 1s an energy consultmg ﬁrm based 1n Portland that helps non- 
res1dent1al end users across Mame procure thelr energy supply and develop strategles to manage 
energy costs Whlle we serve a broad range of customers, mcludmg mun1c1pal1t1es, colleges and 
un1vers1t1es, hospltals, and manufacturers, one of the common challenges our customers face 1s dealmg 
w1th CMP’s and Versant’s electrlc transmlsslon rates, WhlCh are among the hlghest 1n the country 
As we face the prospect of havmg to make wldespread upgrades 1n grld capaclty 1n the commg decades 
to support Ma1ne’s beneﬁclal electrlﬁcatlon goals, the challenge of our state’s hngh transmlsslon rates 
w1ll worsen unless we are thoughtful about when and how we make lnvestments 1n CMP’s and 
Versant’s systems Th1s leglslatlon 1s the nght approach for ensurlng that we advance towards our 
electnﬁcatlon goals wlth a full toolklt for managmg electnc rates 
Prlor to _]OlI‘lll1g CES, I worked for Iberdrola USA, Avangr1d ’s predecessor, from 2014 to 2016 as 
Manager of Smart Grld Plannlng & Programs One of my prlmary respons1b1l1t1es 1n th1s role was to 
work wlth CMP’s team to coord1nate operatlons and evaluatlon of the Boothbay NTA P1lot Pl‘O_]6C1£ 
The Boothbay Pro_]ect saved CMP ratepayers over $70 l’I1llI1OI1 by deferrmg and ultlmately ellmlnatlng 
the need for an $18 m1ll1on upgrade of the transmlsslon l1ne and substatlons servmg the penmsula Th1s 
1s the potentlal opportunlty offered by of non-w1res alternatlves, by el1m1nat1ng an $18 m1ll1on 
mvestment 1n a trad1t1onalw1res solutlon, ratepayers saw $70 m1ll1on 1n total savlngs due to the total 
revenue requlrement that CMP would have collected over the proposed upgrade’s 40-year l1fe 
I recommend that you all conslder why we haven’t seen more examples of non-w1res alternatlves 
success storles hke the Boothbay PI‘O_]€C1l The answer to th1s quest1on 1s on full dlsplay 1n CMP’s 
ongolng rate case Slnce the passage of L D l8ll 1n 2019, CMP has conslstently argued that 
substatlon upgrades and replacements are exempt from revlew by the Non-Wlres Alternative 
Coordmator Th1s argument has gone unchallenged and shlelds a slgnlficant share of CMP’s capltal 
mvestment 1n tradltlonal wlres solunons for grld rel1ab1l1ty from mdependent revlew 
The Non-Wlres Alternatlve Coordmator cannot do 1ts _]Ob unless 1t 1s able to revlew the ut1l1ty’s full 
transmlsslon and d1str1but1on system, mcludmg substatlons CMP’s pos1t1on that substatlon 
components are exempt from NWA revlew 1s llke argulng that a doctor performlng a physlcal exam 
should only focus on a pat1ent’s arms, legs, and head, and should lgnore the pat1ent’s v1tal organs It 
slmply makes no sense Th1s leglslatlon 1s the opportunlty to correct th1s lssue, and to ensure that 
ratepayer-funded lnvestments to expand the gr1d’s capaclty for beneﬁclal electrlﬁcatlon are done 1n the 
most cost-effectlve way posslble Thank you for your COIlSld6l ‘a'[10l'l
