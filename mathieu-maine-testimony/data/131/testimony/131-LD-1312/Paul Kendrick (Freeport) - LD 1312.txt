Letter to the editor: Maine law still keeps victims from holding Catholic Church 
accountable
Published: November 17, 2021 / Portland Press Herald
Maine’s charitable immunity statute provides organizations such as the Catholic 
Church with immunity from civil lawsuits by victims of child sexual abuse.
The Catholic Church in Maine receives $55 million a year in revenues and owns 
approximately $140 million in assets.
Victims are denied access to depositions, discovery, a judge and a jury of their peers.
Victims must not be shut out of the legal process before they can even begin. The 
starting line must not be the finish line. Maine is one of only nine states that retains 
the charitable immunity defense.
The door recently opened by the Legislature and governor (L.D. 589) will just as 
quickly be closed unless further action is taken by the Legislature.
• Civil lawsuits by victims of child sexual abuse help expose pedophiles who have 
outrun the criminal statutes of limitation and remain anonymous.
• Civil lawsuits provide wounded victims with the means to procure financial 
reparations for their harms and injuries.
• Civil lawsuits provide opportunities for victims to demand non-monetary changes to
systems and procedures that will better protect children.
Former Bishop Richard Malone founded the Catholic Foundation of Maine, a cleverly
disguised nonprofit intended to shield assets from child sexual abuse lawsuits. The 
Catholic Foundation of Maine owns $29 million in liquid investments.
The Catholic Church is not the poor and struggling charity that legislators intended to 
protect 100 years ago when the charitable immunity statute was enacted.
Legislators must amend Maine’s charitable immunity statute so that nonprofits are no 
longer protected from civil liability for sex crimes against children.
