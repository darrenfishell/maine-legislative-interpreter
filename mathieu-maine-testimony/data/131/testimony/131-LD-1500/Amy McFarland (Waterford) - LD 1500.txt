Good Day Ladies and Gentleman of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, today
I am writing in support of  LD# 1500.
I believe video monitoring of drop boxes is essential. 
If you are unaware of all the shenanigans that occurred in the past with ballot 
harvesting, then I suggest you watch the documentary "2000 Mules" by Dinesh 
D'souza. There is more than enough evidence in that particular video to prove why we
need video monitoring on drop boxes.
