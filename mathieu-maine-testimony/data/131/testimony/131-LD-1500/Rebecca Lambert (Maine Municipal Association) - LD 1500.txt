 
Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association  
 
In Opposition to  
 
LD 1055 , An Act to Prohibit the Use of Ballot Drop Boxes  
 
April 21 , 2023 
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert , and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1500 
on behalf of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC). For refer ence , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and 
establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
Although the use of ballot boxes surged due to  the pandemic , they have proven to be a 
useful tool in Maine, causing no significant issues. LD 1500 would require municipalities to 
continually monitor ballot drop boxes and maintain that recording for one year. For small communities, this could be a major capitol expense to gain the equipment and technical assistance to manage this task.   
Municipal clerks currently update the voter rolls as information changes and is presented 
to them. In testimony from the Secretary of State on a previous bill brought in front of this committee this session, their office is extremely diligent about keepi ng accurate voter rolls 
particularly when voters are deceased, and local leaders feel this part of the bill is unnecessary.  
The LPC appreciated the intent to keep Maine elections secure but kindly ask the 
committee to consider a vote of ought not to pass.  Thank you for  your time and for  considering 
the municipal perspective on this issue.
