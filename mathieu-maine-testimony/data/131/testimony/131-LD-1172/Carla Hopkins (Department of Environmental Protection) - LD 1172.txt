L.D. 1172 —An Act to Reestablish Annual Reporting on Solid Waste in Maine 
Testimony of: Carla Hopkins/DEP 
Public Hearing: April 5, 2023

38 M.R.S. § 2124-A currently requires the Department to biennially submit the “Waste 
Generation and Disposal Capacity Report," a report analyzing the statewide generation 
of solid waste, statewide recycling rates, and available disposal capacity for solid waste 
in Maine. Up until 2019, this report was completed on an annual basis; passage of L.D. 
1172 would return to this annual reporting requirement. It was changed from annual to 
biennial to be more efficient with staff resources, because the reporting requirements of 
2124-A are quite substantial. It is not just a summary of tonnage reported to the 
Department by waste facilities and of statewide waste generation and disposal capacity 
rates. The report is also required to include additional analysis and reporting to address 
other waste management and recycling issues, including trends ofdisposal pricing, 
potential for supracompetitive pricing, analysis of the fill rate at each landfill and the 
expected lifespan of each landfill, and analysis of the consolidation of ownership in the 
disposal, collection, recycling, and hauling of solid waste. This broad analysis and 
reporting, in addition to the summary of waste and recycling tonnage, require a 
significant amount of staff time involved in producing the report. Additionally, many of 
the larger trends required for analysis do not realize much change on an annual basis 
and can be reported just as effectively at longer intervals. 
The data used for this report come from the annual reports of facilities that are the final 
points of disposition for municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris. 
These final points of disposition may include: disposal at a landfill or waste-to-energy 
facility, export to an out-of-state recycler or disposal facility, or, if applicable, processing 
of recyclable scrap into a new product at an in-state facility. 
The data utilized for this report do not come from municipal solid waste management 
and recycling reports. As per the guiding statute (38 M.R.S. § 2133(7)), municipal solid 
waste management and recycling progress reports are used to gauge municipal 
progress toward helping Maine achieve its statewide waste reduction, recycling, and 
composting goals and are not actually necessary in the development of the Waste

Generation and Disposal Capacity Report. These municipal reports are helpful for 
understanding where there may be opportunities for regional efforts to improve the 
efficiency of materials management programs, but the data tracked and reported by 
municipalities vary greatly and are not always consistent. Some municipalities fail to 
report, some submit reports that are nearly blank, and others submit extensive and 
detailed reports. Maine has nearly 500 municipalities and the Department does not 
currently have the resources to track down reports from each municipality every 1-2 
years. ln addition, the time required to review all of the data in each of the municipal 
reports as well as the facility reports for final disposition adds up. This is because at 
this time data for the Waste Generation and Disposal Capacity Report are reviewed and 
tabulated manually by staff. The Department is in the process ofrexploring data 
modernization and availability options and is expecting to have data more easily 
processed and available for public review in the next few years. The Department would 
suggest reevaluating a return to annual reporting once these systems are in place. 
While the Department does not support this bill for the reasons just explained, the 
Department could be supportive of changing the Waste Generation and Disposal 
Capacity Report to an annual basis if its scope were to be reduced. For example, some 
of the reporting and analysis currently required for the Waste Generation and Disposal 
Capacity Report may be better integrated with the five-year Materials Management Plan 
that is required under 38 M.R.S. § 2122. Much of the scope of the Waste Generation 
and Disposal Capacity Report is redundant to this five-year Materials Management 
Plan. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
