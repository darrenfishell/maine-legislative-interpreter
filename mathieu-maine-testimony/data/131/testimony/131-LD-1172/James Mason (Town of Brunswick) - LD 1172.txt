Joint Standing Committee on  
     Environment and Natural Resources  State House Augusta, Maine 04330  Re:  In Support of LD 1171 and LD 1172  Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich     and Members of the Committee:  The Brunswick Town Council, at its April 3
rd meeting, voted unanimously to support LD 1171 and 
LD 1172.    LD	1171	‐	An	Act	to	Raise	Funding	to	Support	Waste	Reduction, 	Reuse,	Recycling 	and	composting 	in	
Maine.		
 
This bill would raise the state fee associated with landfilling  certain wastes, specifically municipal 
solid waste (MSW) and constructi on and demolition debris. All f ees collected by the Maine DEP 
would be directed back to Maine municipalities to aid in the de velopment of recycling efforts and 
infrastructure. Brunswick, for e xample, recently benefited from  a $50,000 grant, allowing us to 
expand organic waste recycling w ith a clear, mea surable impact.  
Maine’s recycling rate has stalle d in recent years. Many attrib ute this to a lack of infrastructure and 
an underinvestment in public education. Passage of this bill wo uld be a step toward addressing 
these issues.  LD	1172	‐	An	Act	to	Reestablish 	Annual	Reporting 	on	Solid	Waste	in	Maine.	
	This bill would require communities to return to annual (as opp osed to every two years) reporting 
on waste disposal and recycling. This enables more real time un derstanding and adjustment of 
policies related to solid waste management. According to staff,  this would have no impact on 
Brunswick since we record these statistics annually. However, i t does allow the state to understand 
and adjust policy in a manner mo re in line with 21st century ex pectations and needs. 
 We urge the Committee to continue  supporting Maine’s environmen tal goals and by supporting 
these two bills.  Respectfully,   James Mason, Chair Town Council
