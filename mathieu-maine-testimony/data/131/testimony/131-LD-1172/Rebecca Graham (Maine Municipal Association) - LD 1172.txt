In Opposition To 
LD 1172 - An Act to Reestablish Annual Reporting on Solid Waste in Maine 
April 5, 2023 
 
Sen. Brenner, Rep. Gramlich and distinguished members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham and I submitting testimony in opposition LD 1172 - 
An Act to Reestablish Annual Reporting on Solid Waste in Maine, on behalf of the Maine Municipal 
Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the Legislature. The positions 
of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC), who are 
elected by the councils and selectboards of municipalities in each of Maine’s 35 Senate districts. 
This bill is unnecessary as annual reporting regarding the handling of recyclable materials is 
already required to participate in the recently enacted Extender Producer Responsibility (EPR) law, PL 
2021, c. 455, §2. Currently, the department is working with municipalities and other stakeholders to begin 
the data collection that will be linked to reimbursements and will provide a detailed review of all 
managed materials with an appropriate incentive for the duty, the ability to receive funds for work 
necessary to collect the data.  
Additional reporting to the department would be redundant, interrupt the important work that is 
ongoing throughout the summer to develop appropriate audits and program rules, and simply add 
additional work for municipal solid waste managers to provide information the department that it should 
be able to easily obtain directly from the EPR program. 
For all these reasons, officials ask that you leave the recently changed biennial reporting law in 
place, or fund the mandated additional obligation as required.
