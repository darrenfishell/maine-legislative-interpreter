People who are poor or in some way disadvantaged are just as important as those of 
power and means. They do not have the same voice, but that in no way reduces their 
inherent dignity. That includes people with no voice and no resources such as the 
unborn.  So please do not require me to treat them as if they do not matter.  The 
people of Maine should not be required to pay for ending the lives of innocent, 
defenseless and voiceless people.  
The Department of Health and Human Services should be concerned about Health 
and allocating limited resources to improving Health. Pregnancy is NOT a disease.  In
fact Infertility Is a disease or caused by a variety of diseases.  Therefore abortion is 
not "healthcare".  When the success rate is defined by a death, you have to be insane 
or evil to call it "healthcare".  Please support LD 494.
