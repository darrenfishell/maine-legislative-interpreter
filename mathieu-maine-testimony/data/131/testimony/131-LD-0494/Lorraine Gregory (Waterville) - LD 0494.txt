I am writing this in support of LD494 HPO 311:  AN ACT TO CONFORM STATE 
FUNDING TO THE FEDERAL HYDE AMENDMENT, LIMITING FUNDING 
FOR SOME ABORTION SERVICES
Protecting taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortion in violation of their 
conscience is a principle that has enjoyed historically broad support among 
Americans, regardless of their otherwise passionately divided views on the topic.  
The Maine Legislature can better serve the common good by prioritizing policies that 
comprehensively assist women, children and families in need in ways that will not 
only encourage childbirth but make it easier to welcome and raise a new child.
Abortion services are very well funded without tax funds
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 494.  Thank you.
