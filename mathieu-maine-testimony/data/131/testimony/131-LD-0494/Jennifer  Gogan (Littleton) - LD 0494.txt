LD494 An act to conform state funding to the federal Hyde Amendment 
limiƟng funding for some abor Ɵon services.  
 
I am wriƟng today in s upport of LD494.  The Hyde Amendment was enacted in the 70s as a compromise.  
AborƟon became legal and the Hyde Amendment allowed that tax payers would not pay for it, thereby 
those who are opposed to abor Ɵon are not forced to pay for it.  Abor Ɵon is a heavy subject, we are 
talking about ending a person’s life.  With such high stakes and such strong ethical concerns at hand, the 
Hyde Amendment found middle ground.  In 2019 Maine took that middle ground away, this leg islaƟon 
brings back a civil , tolerant, empathe Ɵc consession that recognizes both views on the subject of 
aborƟon. 
 
Thank you for your service and a ƩenƟon.  Please vote yes on LD494.
