In favor of LD 494 
“An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services -” 
Public Hearing May 5, 2023
l 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary, My name is Kathleen March and l’m a resident of Windham 
Monday l testified in opposition of LD 1619 which would allow a full term baby to be aborted 
As l know firsthand the detriment of having an abortion and that the damage does not only apply to 
the developing life of the baby but also the mother, Today l stand here to support LD494, 771, 1197 
1249, 1614 and 1809 
ln particular, l want to speak to LD 494 an act that would prevent Maine taxpayers from funding 
abortions 
Abortion is an act that does not support life, there is nothing in the act of an abortion that relates in 
any way to what is necessary to facilitate life Therefore there IS no Humanitarian reason to fund 
abortions or assist in their funding by society or governments such as the need and purpose for 
government funding in food, shelter and medicine to sustain life 
Tax dollars should be spent on the Basic needs for people to live not be paying for people to die 
As a contributing member of society, l pay my taxes l do not support the act of harming another 
human being and certainly do NOT want MY tax dollars to support taking the Life of a child 
l do not want to be forced into supporting this despicable act against humanity 
Forcing me to pay for abortions in any way and therefore to be party to them is Unconscionable, 
unacceptable, Wrong and it pains me 
I urge you to vote for LD 494 
Thank you 
Kathleen March 
Windham, Maine
