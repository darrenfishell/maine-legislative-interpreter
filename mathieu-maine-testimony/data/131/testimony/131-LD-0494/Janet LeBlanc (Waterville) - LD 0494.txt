LD 494
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Janet LeBlanc and I am a resident of 
Waterville. I am  testifying in support of LD494, HP0311 An Act to Conform State 
Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion 
Services 
Abortion is an elective medical procedure which the destruction of innocent human 
life in the womb takes place.  It is NOT health care! Because abortion isn’t health care
it has no business being part of Maine Care!  Forcing taxpayers to pay for abortion is 
reprehensible.  On May 1, 2023, the Maine State House was initiated by several 
thousand Maine tax payers who took a stand for life.  That was just a small sample of 
Mainers who oppose the destruction of innocent human life.  It was a small sample of 
people who don’t want their tax dollars used to pay for abortion.  A better use for our 
tax dollars is to comprehensively assist women, children, and families in need.  Our 
tax dollars should encourage childbirth and to provide women the tools they need to 
raise children in Maine. 
Just as the federal Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortions
except for rape, incest or life endangerment Maine should prohibit Maine Care for 
funding abortions.   Serving the elderly, our homeless and those with intellectual 
disabilities is a better use for our tax dollars.  Maine is the oldest sate in the nation, so 
more tax dollars should be used to assist the elderly.  Our death rate is higher than our
birth rate.  Tax dollars should be used to encourage childbirth in Maine.   The people 
of Maine are against abortion and shouldn't be forced to pay for it.
