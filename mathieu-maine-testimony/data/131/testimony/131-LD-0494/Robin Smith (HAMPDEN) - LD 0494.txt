LD 494
I support, without question, LD 494, an act to conform state funding to the Federal 
Hyde Amendment, limiting funding for some abortion services.
Its a good Act. Abortion should always be limited, and should not have extensive, 
unlimited funding by any part of government.
Thank you Robin SMith,
