Re: LD 494 , An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting 
Funding for Some Abortion Service s 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to express our strong opposition to LD 494 , An Act to Conform 
State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Service s.  
 
This bill seek s to repeal the provisions enacted in 2019 by the Legislature and signed by the  
Governor to include coverage for abortion care  to all MaineCare members .  
 
Access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care is integral to a person’s physical,  mental,  
and economic well -being. Every person in Maine has the right to make their own  personal 
medical decisions and to access sexual and reproductive health care when and where they need 
it. It is critical that everyone in this state has access to affor dable, high -quality health care, 
including reproductive services – and that they can obtain them free from harassment, 
intimidation, and undue barriers to services.  
 
The Administration has consistently opposed similar bills in the past. What is different t oday is 
that on June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson, the U.S. Supreme Court abandoned nearly fifty years 
of precedent to reverse the constitutional right to abortion. That ruling has paved the way for 
states to severely limit or ban abortion outright, makin g retention of those rights  and this access  
in Maine that much  more critical.  
 
The Legislature acted in the best interest of Maine people when you passed LD 820 in the 129th  
Legislature, and we encourage you to keep that critical piece of statute intact.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Jeanne M. Lambrew, Ph.D.  
Commissioner
