LD 494
Dear Judiciary Committee,
I would like to speak in favor of LD 494.  To tie Maine to the Hyde amendment 
restrictions would not only put Maine in conformity with Federal legislation but it 
would restrict using taxpayer funds, that I am my wife, along with thousands of others
in the state, vehemently oppose in regard to abortion.  It is bad enough to authorize 
the death of innocent children but to force people like us to support murder is 
egregious in the extreme.  Please support this legislation.
