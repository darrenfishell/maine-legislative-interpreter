Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen, and Members of the Judrcrary Commrttee, I 
am Rey Dubors, from Bangor, and I am speakmg m favor of LDs 494, 771, 1197, 1249, 
and 1614x 
I base my presentatron on what 1s FAIR and what 1s MORAL 
The Hyde Amendment l1m1ts Medrcard re1mbursement for some abortron costs, and 1t 1s 
entlrely farr that the Hyde Amendment be enforced 1n Mame, lrke 1t1s m most other 
states Tax payers should not be forced to pay for the electrve procedures that are 
abo1t1on, when they profoundly drsagree wrth abortron, the klllmg of a pre-born ch1ld 
Our elderly , mtellectually drsabled, and homeless people need those tax dollars more 
than the 98% of women who become pregnant through therr own behavrors We 
taxpayers should not have to pay for the consequence of a man and a woman's 
consensual act that results 1n an unplanned pregnancy It's trme for them to pay for the 
result of therr own dec1s1ons 
An Act to Protect a Woman's Rrght to Wrthdraw Consent for an Abortron makes so much 
sense, that I'm even surpnsed to see that th1s legrslatron must be requned as a law Don't 
we all agree that "NO" means "NO! " 
Shouldn't you be allowed to change your mrnd, 
save a baby's l1fe, and have your dec1s1on respected Pass LD 771 wrthout any hagglmg 
It makes so much sense 
LD 1197 1s s1m1larly so strarght forward that 1t should pass wrthout resrstance It 1s Just 
so FAIR that a woman should not be coerced mto k1ll1ng her ch11d Aren't people always 
grven approprrate 1nformat1on/ educatron re elect1ve procedures 
LD 1249 restnct a Physlcran from prescnbmg abortron through telehealth Wouldn't you 
thmk that an ethrcal medrcal practrtroner would want to do an actual face to face 
physrcal exam of a pregnant lady before domg somethmg so drastrc as lull her ch1ld To 
abort a baby wrthout knowmg the correct fetal age, placenta locatron, or potentral 
presence of ectoprc pregnancy seem tantamount to malpractrce Isn't the health and 
safety of the mother supposed to be so 1mportant? LD 1249 certamly protects the health 
and safety of the mother more than ANY of the brlls drscussed 1n hearmgs on Monday 
LD 1614 requrres that an ultrasound be completed and counselmg be provrded 
Approprrate dlagnostlcs and full drscussron of safety and optrons seems l1ke sometlnng a 
respectable practrtroner would provrde 
All of us testrfymg today are gomg to tell you these brlls ought to pass, and I recommend 
that you vote "Ought to pass" , but not Just because they m1ght result n1 fewer babres 
bemg lqlled Pass these b1lls because they'll result 1n the mothers bemg treated more 
safely and professronally, and the medrcal provrders Wlll practrce therr trade 1n a more 
professronal mam1er
