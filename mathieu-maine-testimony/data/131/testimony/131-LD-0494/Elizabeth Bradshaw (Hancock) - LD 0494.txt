LD 494
An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hype Amendment, Limiting Funding
for Some Abortion Services           LD 494    SUPPORT
Dear members of the Judiciary Committee – 
My name is Elizabeth Bradshaw, from Hancock.
 I am also writing in FAVOR of LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249. LD 1614 being heard at 
9:00 AM.    I also include LD 1809 scheduled to be heard at 1:00 PM.
These laws need to stay in place to ensure women’s rights. 
We need to retain a law that would limit funding for some abortion services and 
protect a woman’s right to withdraw consent for the abortion without penalty.  
 How many times have you changed your mind about something in your life? 
The chemical pill affects two individuals and needs to be limited and overseen.  There
isn’t enough research as to the long term effects of it on the woman, not to mention 
the death of an innocent human being. Dads are often effected also, but have no say 
because it’s not their bodies. 
The parent is in charge of their minor child! They need to be consulted when 
something as life changing as having an abortion is on a person. 
Every life is precious and designed by God. There is a commandment that says,          
Do not murder! All of us will stand before our creator some day whether you believe 
in him or not. God tells us in the Bible, 
“For you yourself created my inmost parts;                                                                     
you knit me together in my mother’s womb.                                                                   
I will thank you because I am marvelously made;                                                           
your works are wonderful and I know it well.”  Psalm 139:12 & 13.
What if your mother had aborted you? 
Thank you for reading my testimony. 
This is why I ask you to vote in FAVOR or LD 494, LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249, LD 
1614, as well as LD 1809.
