Isabelle Schmidt
Bowdoin, Maine
LD 494
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Isabelle Schmidt, from Bowdoin. 
I am writing to speak in support of LD 494, “An Act to Conform State Funding to the 
Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services.”
As things stand since 2019, Maine taxpayers have been held financially responsible 
for abortions all across Maine.  I conscientiously object to being given no choice but 
to encourage the intentional killing of the unborn for no good excuse.  This is against 
the Hyde Amendment and does no good for the character of those who would use 
abortion as birth control.  Anyone exercising their choice to get pregnant who then 
chooses abortion ought at least to take financial responsibility for their choice to abort
their child.  
There are many unfortunate Mainers who have fatal diseases and conditions unrelated
to their choice.  It is especially not fair to them either that careless residents of Maine 
receive financial government support from our pockets to “fix” their bad choices.  
Please vote “ought to pass” on LD 494.  Thank you.
