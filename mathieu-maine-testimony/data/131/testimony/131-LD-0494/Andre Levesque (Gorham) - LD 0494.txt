TESTIMONY OF ANDRE LEVESQUE. 
In favor of LD 494 
“An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services -" 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
Sponsored by Rep Kathy Javner of Chester 
Public Hearing May 5, 2023 
Senator Camey and Representative Moonen, honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary 
My name is Andy Levesque I'm a resident of Gorham, a faithful Catholic, a member of the Knights of 
Columbus, and a board member of Maine Right to Life 
So we meet again, after Mondays historic show of pro-life Mainers opposing LD1619 which would 
tenriinate the life of a newbom baby 
l hope and pray that our sheer numbers will give you affirmation that the majority of Mainer‘s do not 
support the Governor ’s Bill to kill our newborns1 
Today I support LD494,771,1197,1249,1614 and 1809 
ln particular, lwill be testifying in favor of LD 494, an act that would prevent Maine taxpayers from 
funding abortions 
For years, while praying peacefully in frontof abortion clinics, l would see mothers enter the building 
Then exit - broken and sorrowful I have seen this in their eyes and on a few rare occasions, the 
same expressions would be on their boyfriends or husbands 
Though some of you may not believe in sin, l assure you sin exists and we are all accountable for the 
actions we make in our lifetime 
Because abortion IS the act of ending the life of a child) 
My conscience detests this action, just as lwould not harm another person 
So why am I forced to participate in this horrible crime against humanity ‘? 
As an Army veteran, I served to uphold the laws of this land, but more importantly, I uphold the laws 
of my creator 
l won't quote any Bible passages or give you historical accounts of the mistreatment of Americans 
l will say that each one of us has a MORAL compass 
We know the difference between right and wrong 
For me, my family, and my Christian community to be forced to pay for abortions is unacceptable 
l urge you to vote for LD 494, It's the rightthing to do
