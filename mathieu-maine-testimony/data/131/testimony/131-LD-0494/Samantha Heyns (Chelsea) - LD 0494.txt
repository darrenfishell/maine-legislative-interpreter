LD 494
 I am writing in favor of LD 494 - An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal 
Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services
I do not believe tax money should be spend on the ending of life. Abortion is by 
definition to abort or end a life.
I ask the committee to vote yes on LD494
