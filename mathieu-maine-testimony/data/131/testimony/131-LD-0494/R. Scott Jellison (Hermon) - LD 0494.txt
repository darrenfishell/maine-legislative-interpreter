Good Morning Committee members. 
Times they are A-Changing by Bob Dylan seems so relevant.  All generations have seen change but to 
what degree and how does it affect life.  Look around and see is all that is needed.  We are killing or 
medicating our problems as can be witnessed on the streets all around us. 
Now we need to pass laws because we lack common sense on how we need to treat each other.   
Today there are multiple bills coming before you that I am asking you to vote ought to pass on.
