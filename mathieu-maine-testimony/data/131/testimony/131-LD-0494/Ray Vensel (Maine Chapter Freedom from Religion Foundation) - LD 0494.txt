Re: LD 494 An Act To Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding 
for Some Abortion Services  
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony AGAINST LD 494.  
The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal Medicaid and Medicare funds for abortion 
care. Its effect is disproportionate, restricting abortion access for low-income people (primarily 
Black and brown communities). So it is discriminatory and racist in denying the rights treasured 
by other populations. Bringing Maine state law into alignment with this amendment would have 
the same result. It would also restrict abortion access for federal employees and their dependents, 
Native American and Indigenous people who use Indian Health Services, military members, and 
people in federal prisons.  
Reproductive health care is legal in Maine. It is not right to make it less accessible for some but 
not for others. Please protect reproductive health care in Maine and vote against LD 494. Thank 
you.  
Sincerely, 
-Ray Vensel
