Sen Carney, Rep. Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee,
My name is Renee Fortin, I live in Lewiston
I am writing in support of LD 494~ An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal 
Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for
Some Abortion Services. 
Summary: Public Law 2019, chapter 274 enacted the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
22, section 3196, which
requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide coverage to a 
MaineCare member for
abortion services. Abortion services that are not approved Medicaid services must be 
funded by the State.
The so-called federal Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for 
abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest. This bill repeals Title 
22, section 3196, removing the requirement that the department provide abortion 
services to MaineCare members and removing the requirement that the State pay 
when the abortion services are not covered by Medicaid.
My reason for Support: This bill would roll back the law passed in 2019 that required 
Maine taxpayers to fund abortions.
It protects taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortion in violation of their 
conscience. It is a principle that has enjoyed historically broad support among 
Americans, regardless of their otherwise passionately divided views concerning 
abortion. It has also been life-saving: some analyses have found that limitations on 
federal funding of
elective abortion, such as the Hyde Amendment, have saved well over two million 
lives.
 Forcing Maine people to fund a "service" that they are categorically opposed to is 
morally reprehensible. Especially when it is called "reproductive health".
Our elderly, those with Intellectual Disabilities, our homeless are need our tax dollars 
so much more than
those who are opting for an elective medical procedure. Time to stop placing our 
elderly at the Back of the line for services.
Please vote "ought to pass" on LD 494
