LD 494 I-lPO3l1 An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting 
Funding for Some Abortion Services 
Support 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee My name is Karen Vachon I 
am the Executive Director of Maine Right To Life, in Auburn, and a resident of Scarborough I come before you 
today to speai< in Support LD 494 
Maine Right to Life is a state affiliate of the National Right To Life Committee We are a non-profit organization 
founded to protect and uphold the dignity and worth of every human life from conception to natural death by 
making abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia socially, ethically, and legally unacceptable and to actively promote 
positive alternatives 
We aie Pro-Llfe, Pi 0-Active, and Pro-Women Our membeis share a belief that women weie ci eated uniquely to 
fulfill a very important role in mankind Women have a womb They bring new life into the world They are to be 
honored, respected, and protected The word, "reproductive" means to produce an offspring 
After the 1973 Roe v Wade decision, many federal programs, including Medicaid, started paying for elective 
abortions Congress never voted to authorize abortion funding under these programs Administrators and courts, 
however, interpreted the language as authorizing and requiring the payment of medical services, including 
abortion 
In the interest of protecting potential life, Congress wanted to promote childbirth, as the more attractive 
alternative over abortion The distinction between necessary medical services and abortion needed to be clear 
Medical procedures are in the interest of saving human life, abortion terminates a human life There is a differencel 
By 1976, the federal Medicaid program was paying for 300,000 abortions per year, and the numbers were 
escalating rapidly Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL) proposed an amendment to the Departments of Labor and 
Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act of 1977 prohibiting funds appropriated through the bill from 
being "used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were 
carried to term" 
Congress responded by attaching a "limitation amendment" to the annual appropriations bill for health and human 
services Known as the Hyde Amendment, it prohibits the federal reimbursement for abortion, except in cases of 
rape, incest and the life of the mother This is a "rider" to the annual appropriations bill, which expires, every year, 
on September ;suth I:V€l’y year, since the initial passage, the Hyde Amendment, has received bipartisan support It 
is estimated that the Hyde Amendment has saved 2 5 Million lives 
Maine is the oldest state in the country, with a median age of 45 We are one of four states in the country that has 
more deaths/year than, births Maine aborts 5 2 babies each day 
Policy matters We should be promoting and supporting new life The majority of Maine taxpayers oppose the 
taxpayer funding of SDOYHO" I urge this committee to vote ought to pass on this legislation I\/lame deserves 
better
