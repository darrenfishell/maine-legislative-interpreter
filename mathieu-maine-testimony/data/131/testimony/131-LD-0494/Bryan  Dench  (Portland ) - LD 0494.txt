LD 494
I am testifying in support of this LD 494 prohibiting the use of public funds to pay for
abortions.  
 
For many decades it has been understood that proper respect for the views of all 
persons on abortion requires that public funds raised by taxation not be spent on 
abortion, a practice many taxpayers consider morally and ethically repugnant. Only an
extreme desire for increasing the numbers of babies aborted coupled with disregard 
for the sincere views of taxpayers could motivate violating this long standing 
principle in Maine.
