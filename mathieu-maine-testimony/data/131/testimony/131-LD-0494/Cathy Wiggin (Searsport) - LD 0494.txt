   As stated in previous bills, I am a born again Christian and believe the Bible wholly.
Based on the Bible life starts at conception and so therefore any form of abortion is 
killing a baby.  Therefore ther is no need for funding abortions because they should'nt 
be happening.  I also feel that this finding comes from tax dollars. My husband and I 
are older and living on Social Security and I feel my tax dollars could go for things 
that are right.  Thank you for hearing my opinion and I hope it makes a difference 
enough to turn it down.
