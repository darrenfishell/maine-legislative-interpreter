Dear Committee Members:
I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.  
By my paying my taxes and the State using this $$ to fund abortion, then you are 
violating my moral and spiritual commitment to GOD.
I do not pay taxes, as required by law,  so that you can use this $$ to fund illicit items.
I pay my taxes so that you can keep the roads and infrastructure in good shape and 
pay for items that are necessary for the State to operate.  I am tired of the State paying
for those who want to KILL babies.
Again, I ask that you vote OUGHT to PASS on this bill.
