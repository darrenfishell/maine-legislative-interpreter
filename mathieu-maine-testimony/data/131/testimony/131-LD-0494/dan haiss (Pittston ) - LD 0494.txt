This unconstitutional move to force people to use their taxes to pay for something 
they believe to be morally abhorrent is grounds for complete denial of any state 
authority over its citizens. It is a war on its most defenseless and has grave 
consequences that will result in further societal collapse. I oppose this mindset and 
will work tirelessly against the state to minimize any taxes it would ordinarily get 
based on trust.
