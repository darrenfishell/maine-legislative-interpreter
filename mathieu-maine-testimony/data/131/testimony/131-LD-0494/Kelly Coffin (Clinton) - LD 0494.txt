Kelly Coffin
Clinton
LD 494
Honored Members of the Judiciary Committee , My name is Kelly Coffin from 
Clinton, Maine. I am testifying in favor LD 494, HP 311. I am in favor of Maine Law 
coming into alignment with the Federal Hyde Amendment. As a tax payer I find it 
ABHORRENT that my tax dollars go to support abortion of ANY type. To me this is 
taxation without representation. Mainecare as a program is already budgetarily tight. 
Continued coverage will likely add more cost to the annual budget thereby increasing 
tax payor burden. Please vote to repeal title 22 section 3196.  
I also would like to express my support for LD1197, HP 0757 An act to Prevent 
Coerced Abortion. It does happen . I have heard and read of personal experiences. 
Thank you.
