James Cleary
South Berwick 
LD 494
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 494.
It is 2023 and with the recent Dobbs decision, the issue of abortion is very much up 
for debate across the country. There is no federally recognized right to abortion, as the
Dobbs decision makes it clear that the previous Roe decision was deeply flawed.
The federal Hyde Amendment was established for a reason. While there are deeply 
divided opinions on the abortion issue, it is recognized that where abortion remains 
legal, it should not be funded by taxpayers, since a major portion of that population is 
deeply opposed to the ending of innocent human life through abortion. The same 
principle which exists at the federal level should also apply at the state level.
Please deem LD 1748 “Ought To Pass” to align Maine policy with federal policy. 
Thank you for your consideration.
