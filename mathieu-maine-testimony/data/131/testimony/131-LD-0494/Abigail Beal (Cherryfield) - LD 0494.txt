 
LD 494  
An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde 
Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services,  
Presented by Representative Javner  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Committee on Judiciary,  
My name is Abigail Beal of Cherryfield, Maine.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this 
issue.  
I urge you to SUPPORT LD 494, An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde 
Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services.   
Thomas Jeffe rson wrote, “That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the 
propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.”   
Abortion is murder, and no taxpayer should be forced to pay for the murder of the innocent.  
So I ask you to support LD 494. Please protect life by voting, “Ought to Pass”.  Thank you for 
your time.
