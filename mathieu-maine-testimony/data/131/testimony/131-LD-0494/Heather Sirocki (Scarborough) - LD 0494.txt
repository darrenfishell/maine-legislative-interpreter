LD 494 - An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, 
Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services 
Year after year, we hear that more people are dying in Marne than being born, we hear about 
the labor shortages, and we hear about our dismal economy 
Maine is old and tired 
Paying for more abortions each year is clearly not the answer 
Alignment with the Hyde Amendment makes sense 
LD 771 - An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw Consent for an 
Abortion 
Sen Brakey’s bill would allow the mother the ability to change her mind Whether it be 
pressure from a family member, a provider, an employer, or any other person, the mother 
should never be forced or coerced to continue with ending the life of her baby 
LD 1197 An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion 
Minors need information to make informed decisions when facing the life-changing situation of 
pregnancy to avert coercion 
LD 1249 - An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by Prohibiting 
Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices Through Telehealth 
or Other Electronic Communication 
Telehealth cannot replace an in person examination At least two conditions are a concern 
before prescribing chemical abortifacients 1 ) ectopic pregnancy (A baby not situated in the 
uterus ) and 2 ) a pregnancy that is more advanced than the mother realizes Chemical 
abortions are not recommended after 11 weeks This bill involves basic public safety 
LD 1614 — An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an Abortion 
Ultrasounds before an abortion discern ectopic pregnancies, confirm the number of fetuses, 
confirm the gestational age, and inform the provider of the anatomy of the mother Many 
post-abortive women are filled with regret, a 48 hour wait period is humane 
l urge SUPPORT for all of these biils.
