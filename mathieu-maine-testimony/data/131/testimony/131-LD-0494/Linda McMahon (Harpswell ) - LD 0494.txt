Linda McMahon
Harpswell 
LD 494
Senator Carney, Representative Honored Members of the Judiciary Committee
My name is Linda McMahon, Harpswell, Maine. I am testifying in favor LD 494, HP 
311. I am in favor of Maine Law coming into alignment with the Federal Hyde 
Amendment. I don’t want to be complicit in the murder of innocents. Abortion 
services have plenty of money.
Planned Parenthood’s PAC spent 45 million trying to sway voters in recent elections. 
Use that money, not the taxpayers
Please vote “Ought to Pass.” 
Thank you
