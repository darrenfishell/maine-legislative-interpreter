Senator
Anne
Carney ,
Representative
Matt
Moonen,
and
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan
and
I
am
a
staf f
member
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
I’m
testifying
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
494:
An
Act
to
Conform
State
Funding
to
the
Federal
Hyde
Amendment,
Limiting
Funding
for
Some
Abortion
Services.
The
premise
of
this
bill
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
will
of
the
Maine
people
who
robustly
supported
private
and
public
insurance
coverage
for
abortion
care
in
2019
via
passage
of
LD
820.
Subsequently ,
opponents
of
removing
insurance
barriers
to
this
care
failed
to
acquire
enough
signatures
for
a
people’ s
veto.
As
a
legal,
safe
and
common
medical
procedure,
abortion
should
not
be
subjected
to
restrictions
not
imposed
on
other
medical
services.
Since
1977,
the
federal
Hyde
Amendment
has
perpetuated
a
two-tiered
system
of
health
care
based
primarily
on
income,
with
disproportionate
impacts
on
Black,
Brown
and
Indigenous
Americans.
When
Maine
passed
LD
820
we
joined
16
other
states
in
proclaiming
that
income
ought
not
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
can
determine
their
reproductive
future.
GRR!s
want
pregnant
Mainers
to
feel
supported
and
safe,
and
LD
494
ignores
the
voices
of
Maine
people.
GRR!
ur ges
the
committee
to
oppose
LD
494.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration,
Cait
V aughan
&
GRR!s
across
Maine
