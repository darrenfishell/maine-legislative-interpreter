Please save the childhood of the children of the State of Maine and support LD 494, 
LD 771, LD 1197, LD 1249, and LD 1614. I beg of you,  vote "ought to pass" on 
these bills. So many aspects of these bills are important to our future generation, save 
the lives of children in the womb.
Thank you for your service
