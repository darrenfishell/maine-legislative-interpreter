13 l st Leg1slature 
Testimony of Senator Stacey Guerm 
In support of L.D. 494, An Act to Conform State Fundmg to the Federal Hyde 
Amendment, Llmltlng Fundmg for Some Abortion Services 
Before the Judiciary Commlttee 
May 5, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representatwe Moonen, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the J omt Standmg 
Comm1ttee on J ud1c1ary I am Senator Stacey Guerm and I represent D1str1ct 4, wh1ch mcludes 
all ofP1scataqu1s County and 11 commumt1es 1n Penobscot County Please accept my testunony 
1n support of L D 494, An Act to Conform State F undzng to the Federal Hyde Amendment, 
Lzmztzng F undzng for Some Abortzon Servzces 
As a woman who came of age dur1ng the generatlon of abortlon legahzatron, my fnends andI 
were told that abort1ons were not k1ll1ng bables, mstead that the fetus was Just a “blob of tlssue” 
Sc1ent1ﬁc med1cal advances have proved, that as young women, we were l1ed to, pregnancy 
sonograms clearly show a baby 
Four years ago, I test1ﬁed 1n oppos1t1on to a b1ll that ultnnately expanded abortlon serv1ces, for 
those on Ma1neCare, at the expense of Mame taxpayers 
As recently as January of th1s year, pollmg has shown that 60 percent of Amerlcans are opposed 
or strongly opposed to taxpayer funded abortron 1 
I would note that the number of those opposed 
to taxpayer funded abort1ons has mcreased s1nce a s1m1lar poll was conducted 1n January 2022 
Knowmg that the ma] or1ty of Amencans oppose taxpayer dollars belng used for abortron 
servrces, I have to ask the questlons Why are we allowmg th1s to happen‘? Is 1t not our _]Ob to put 
laws and po11c1es 1n place that reﬂect the w1shes of our constnuents ‘? 
There are many senous budget pr1or1t1es before the Leg1slature that Mamers are askmg for us to 
CO1'lS1(l61 ‘ Fundmg for nurs1ng homes, Chlld care, and roads and bndges for safe travel, are Justa 
few There are areas of the state on the verge of beconnng matermty care deserts, rather than 
uslng taxpayer dollars to ehrmnate the l1ves of these prec1ous baby boys and grrls, perhaps We 
should look at fmdmg ways and fundmg to prov1de greater obstetrlc care for Ma1ners, too’? 
I support L D 494, wh1ch would conform state fundlng of abort1on serv1ces to the Hyde 
Amendment, because 1t better reﬂects how the ma] onty of people feel when 1t comes to the use 
of taxpayer dollars Please support L D 494 and all the pro-11fe b1lls be1ng heard today
