LD 494, HP0311 An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment,
Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services - Rep. Kathy Javner of Chester
Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Clare Desrosiers, from Linneus, ME. I am submitting written testimony 
today in Support of LD 494. 
Protecting taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortion in violation of their 
conscience is a principle that has enjoyed historically broad support among 
Americans, regardless of their otherwise passionately divided views on the topic. It 
has also been life-saving: some analyses have found that limitations on federal 
funding of elective abortion, such as the Hyde Amendment, have saved well over two 
million lives.
The Maine Legislature can better serve the common good by prioritizing policies that 
comprehensively assist women, children, and families in need in ways that will not 
only encourage childbirth but make it easier to welcome and raise a new child.
1) As Maine stands on the precipice of legalizing late term abortions, now is the time 
to stand against tax funding for abortions.
2) Abortion services are very well funded without tax funds.
3) Forcing Maine people to fund a "service" that they are categorically opposed to is 
morally reprehensible.
4) Our elderly, those with Intellectual Disabilities, our homeless are need our tax 
dollars so much more than those who are opting for an elective medical procedure. 
Time to stop placing our elderly at the BACK of the line for services.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote Ought to Pass on LD 494. Thank you
