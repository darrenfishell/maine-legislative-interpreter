The most widely accepted definition of abortion involves the ending of human life. 
As a Christian, I believe it is my duty to stand for those who are defenseless and have 
no voice and that the ending of their life is morally wrong. The Hyde amendment was 
agreed upon as a way to ensure people with my moral convictions are not forced to 
violate our conscience by funding procedures, through our taxes, which we believe to 
be evil. Though I would prefer there was no demand for abortion in our State, I 
certainly don't want my tax money to pay to end the lives of my fellow Mainers.
