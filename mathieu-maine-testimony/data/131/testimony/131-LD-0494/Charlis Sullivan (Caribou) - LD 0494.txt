Charlis Sullivan
Caribou
LD 494
Representative Kathy Javner and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Charlis Sullivan and I am a resident of Caribou. 
I come before you today to speak in support of LD 494 HP0311, An Act to Conform 
State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion 
Services. 
Mainers should not be forced to pay for abortion services that they are opposed to. 
Additionally, this diverts much needed funding and services from the indigent, 
elderly, and disabled. Our growing elderly population in Maine could benefit greatly 
from these funds.
For these reasons, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to Pass” on this LD494 which 
reflects the overwhelming consensus of Mainers.
