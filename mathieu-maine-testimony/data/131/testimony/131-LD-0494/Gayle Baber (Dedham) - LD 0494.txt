Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the judiciary my name is Gayle Baber 
and I reside in Dedham, Maine 
I come to speak in support of the following bills 
LD 494 LD 77I LD II97 LD I249 LD I6I4M 
I am a lifelong Maine resident born and raised in Caribou I met my husband while I was 
an exchange student in college and imported him back to my great state of Maine We have 
4 living children working, in health-related ﬁelds and 2 who we lost through miscarriage 
Our youngest, twin daughters born at 34 weeks remained hospitalized for a month soI 
understand the delicate balance of life 
On Monday I listened to testimony from pro choice advocates including those mothers 
who valued and wanted the babies they carried, but were unable to because of biological 
anomalies preventing a viable life for their unborn child 
Others believed it was their body and their choice regarding their“reproductive rights” 
Sadly, it sounded like they were seeking “recreationaI rights” to have sexual encounters with 
casual or unsafe partners IWith every choice, there IS a consequence sometimes good 
and sometimes bad Maine residents should not be forced to pay for the misguided 
encounters of others through taxation and increased insurance premiums 
Our efforts should be proactive in advance of unplanned pregnancies to educate, 
inform and provide resources to potential parents making them fully aware of the 
consequences of their choices Otherwise, our ﬁnancial and moral wheels will continue to 
spin, and unborn babies will continue to pay the real price I worry about the Maine my 
3-I/2 year old grandson will grow up in 
I ask the committee,to vote Ought to Pass on LD 494, LD 77I, LD I I97, 
LD I249, and LD l6l4. 
Thank you all for the many long hours you have listened to testimony for those supporting 
both the rights of a mother and her unborn child 
Before voting on the many abortion-related bills this session, I respectfully ask each of you 
to consider visiting both an abortion clinic and a pregnancy resource center, and/or to view 
the ZOI9 movie,“UnpIanned" to see the path(s) we need to take to protect ALL Maine 
lives
