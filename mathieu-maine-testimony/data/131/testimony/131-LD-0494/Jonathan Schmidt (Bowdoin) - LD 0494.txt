Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 494. 
I support LD 494 because its provisions, in combination with several other pro-life bills 
currently under consideration, will help to restore common sense safeguards and necessary 
restraint to Maineâ€™s permissive abortion laws.   
The Federal Hyde Amendment appropriately recognizes and respects the fact that a large 
share of Americans, including me, have the deepest moral objections to abortion.  
Therefore, use of public funds (I.e. tax money) to fund abortions is not only offensive to us, 
but makes us complicit in the practice.   Maine should follow the Hyde Amendment principle. 
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS. Thank you.
