LD 494
I agree that providing abortion services to MaineCare members and requiring the 
State to pay when the abortion services are not covered by Medicaid is not good use 
of our tax dollars.  It would be much more appropriate to fund programs that would 
help our elderly, those with Intellectual Disabilities and the homeless.  I am 
adamantly opposed to tax dollars being spent for the funding of abortion. 
The government is suppose to protect all life, and that should include the unborn as 
well and this bill will do that.
I strongly support LD 494.
