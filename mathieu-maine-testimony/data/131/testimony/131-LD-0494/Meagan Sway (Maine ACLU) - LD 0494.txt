AMERICAN GIVII. LIBERTIES UNIUN 
Maine‘ 
TESTIMONY OF MEAGAN SWAY, ESQ 
LD 494 — Ought Not To Pass 
An Act To Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, 
Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
May 5, 2021 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, greetings My name is Meagan Sway, and I am 
policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, a statewide 
organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties guaranteed by 
the Maine and U S Constitutions On behalf of our members, I am here to testify 
against LD 494, which would impose dangerous and unlawful barriers preventing 
access to health care 
Every person who is pregnant faces two constitutionally-protected choices to 
continue the pregnancy or terminate it The decision not to have an abortion is 
simultaneously a decision to continue the pregnancy to term and give birth, and the 
decision to have an abortion is a decision to end the pregnancy These bills would 
return us to the day when MaineCare would provide coverage for only one of these 
two constitutional decisions 
Providing coverage for pregnancy but not abortion-related care would violate Article 
1, Section 1 of the Maine Constitution, which guarantees all people in Maine the 
right to liberty and safety, because it would coercively interfere with a person’s 
decision regarding whether or not to continue with a pregnancy 
As the Law Court has recognized, the right to make intensely personal decisions 
about one’s body, one’s health, and one’s intimate relationships, free from 
unwarranted government interference, is a fundamental constitutional right
1 
protected by the Ma1ne C0nst1tut1on 1 The dec1s1on to cont1nue or termlnate a 
pregnancy hes at the core of that r1ght2 
By prov1d1ng coverage for all necessary med1ca1 expenses for patlents who dec1de to 
cont1nue a pregnancy but wzthholdmg coverage for pat1ents who dec1de to termmate 
the1r pregnancy, the state would be 1mpos1ng coerc1on on th1s most personal of 
dec1s1ons Forcmg or coerc1ng a person to carry the1r pregnancy to term aga1nst 
the1r W111, delay1ng them access to necessary abortlon care, and/or compell1ng them 
to make dangerous sacr1f1ces 1n order to afford abort1on ]eopard1zes the1r r1ght to 
pursue and obta1n her own l1berty and safety 
In add1t1on, th1s leg1slat1on would allow the State to d1scr1m1nate agamst people 
who dec1de to obta1n an abortlon as compared to people who dec1de to cont1nue a 
pregnancy, 1n v1o1at1on of Art1cle 1, Sect1on 6-A of the Ma1ne C0nst1tut1on3 
By fund1ng only one of two mutually exc1us1ve opt1ons for a patlent populat1on that 
are dependent on that fund1ng, LD 494 would take the dec1s1on away from the 
pat1ent, who 1s 1n the best pos1t1on to dec1de what 1s best Th1s b1ll would 1mpose 
substant1al harm on Ma1ners 1n need of medlcal care and would v1olate the Ma1ne 
C0nst1tut1on To ensure that all people 1n Ma1ne, regardless of the1r 1ncome and 
regardless of the source of the1r health 1nsurance coverage, have access to abort1on 
care, we urge you vote ought not to pass
