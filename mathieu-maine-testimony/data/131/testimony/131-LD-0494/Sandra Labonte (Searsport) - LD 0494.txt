Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Sandra Labonte and I live in Searsport. Thank you for this opportunity to 
present this testimony and for your serving the state of Maine. 
I stand here today in support of 
LD494 An Act to Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, 
Limiting Funding for Some Abortion Services 
Mainecare recipients are among the poorest in our state. Why do we fund the abortion of 
poor peoples’ babies? Why are we discriminating against them? Do they have less to 
offer our society? 
I stand here today in support of 
LD1249 An Act to Protect the Quality of Care Provided via Telehealth by 
Prohibiting Physicians from Prescribing Abortion-inducing Drugs or Devices 
Through Telehealth or Other Electronic Communication 
If you are going to provide this service, the least you could do is require the provider to 
see the patient in person. Authorization to administer a drug online which results in the 
death of a human offspring and which can also harm the mother should not be given so 
recklessly. 
I stand here today in support of 
LD1614 An Act to Require an Ultrasound and Certain Counseling Before an 
Abortion 
I believe that having an ultrasound at least 48 hours before abortion would give the 
woman a way to make an informed decision about something that could change her life 
forever. 
I also add my support to LD771 An Act to Protect a Woman's Right to Withdraw 
Consent for an Abortion and LD1197 An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortion. 
My most compelling reason for supporting these bills is my heart-felt conviction thatI 
must speak for the most innocent among us — the unborn child. 
Thank you for your time. 
Please vote ought to pass.
