Position: Support
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name 
is Terri Conley, from Glenburn, ME. I come before you today to speak in Support of 
LD 494, 
LD 771,   LD 1197,   LD 1249,  LD 1614,  and LD 1809
I support all these bills for the following reasons: 
1.LD 494- Abortion services are very well funded without MY tax funds and 
forcing me to fund a "service" that I am categorically opposed to is morally 
reprehensible.
2.LD 771- A woman should always have the right to change her mind about an 
abortion and if an abortion is performed after consent has been withdrawn, there must 
be criminal consequences.
3.LD 1197 is a straightforward requirement for additional notice and information to 
be provided to any woman seeking an abortion. It’s common sense with any serious 
medical procedure to have notice of rights and risks related to that procedure.
4.LD 1249- Nearly half of all abortions in America today are chemical abortions, 
becoming
increasingly prevalent as liberal state legislatures and the FDA have rolled back 
regulations and safety measures. In a post-Roe world, where many states are having 
serious conversations about limitations on abortion, the abortion industry has 
frantically pushed for the expansion of mail-order or internet abortions. The rise of 
chemical abortion is unquestionably a push by the advocates to supersede 
conservative abortion laws around our country; to make abortion accessible to 
everyone, in every state, all the time; and to ultimately increase the number of unborn 
babies killed in America today. It increases the ease of access with little 
accountability, it’s not safe for women and the lack of accountability for prescribers 
opens the door to fraud and abuse.
5.LD 1614’s changes would provide a woman with more information to make a 
life-changing choice.
6.LD 1809- Abortion is a life changing decision that has devastating consequences.
In conclusion, for these reasons, I ask the committee to vote “Ought to
Pass” on the 6 above-mentioned bills. Thank you!
