Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary:  
 
I am Katrin Teel of Glenburn, Maine. I am writing to testify in support of L.D. 494, An Act to 
Conform State Funding to the Federal Hyde Amendment, Limiting Funding for Some Abortion 
Services. 
 
Abortion services are very well funded in Maine without tax funds.  Forcing Maine people to fund 
a "service" that they are categorically opposed to is unacceptable and morally reprehensible. 
 
Toward that end, I encourage you to vote Ought to Pass on L.D.494. Thank you for allowing me 
to contribute my testimony.
