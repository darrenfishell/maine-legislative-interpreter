Senator Carney, Representatrve Moonen and members of the Mame Commrttee on 
Judlcxary. I am Wendy Merrill from Benton. 
I am here to testrfy 1n support of LD 1197, An Act to Prevent Coerced Abortzon 
The State of Mame has a powerful duty to ensure a decrsron to abort 1s voluntary, 
wlthont pressure, or coercron. Studies show that up to 60% of women abort 
because ofpressure from someone else (https /itmyurl com/MlCoercronBan) A 
women pressured to abort is not makmg tlns decrston for herself Just last mght,a 
woman told me that her husband coerced her into abortmg her last baby by 
threatenmg to leave her and then hvmg chrldren. She dtd abort, but here she 1s 40 
years later, lamentmg that she caved to that pressure, strll mourmng the loss of her 
baby, and regretting havmg that abortron He ended up leaving her anyway 
In my role as Executrve Dtrector of a pregnancy help center, I have walked wrth 
numerous women through the process of heahng after abornon Most of those 
women felt coerced to abort then baby. A p1ece of health 1s mental health Many 
women suffer from mental health rssues after a coerced abortlon. To rgnore tlns 1s 
trresponstble and cruel 
If we truly are about women & Women’s nghts, about a Woman’s nght to choose, 
then we must be domg everythmg we possrbly can to ensure women are makmg 
abortion dec1s1ons after they have gathered all the facts, have ample trme to 
process them, and are 1n no way pressured to end the hfe of thexr baby. A woman 
who 1s coerced 1s not makmg her own chorce. 
I urge you to vote ‘YES’ to LD 1197, as Well as to LD 494, LD 771, LD 1249, LD 
1614, and LD 1809 Thank you
