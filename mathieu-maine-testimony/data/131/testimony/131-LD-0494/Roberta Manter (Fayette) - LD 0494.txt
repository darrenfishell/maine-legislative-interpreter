LD 494
Please vote LD 494 ought to pass.  "Health care" is defined as, "the maintaining and 
restoration of health by the treatment and prevention of disease especially by trained 
and licensed professionals (as in medicine, dentistry, clinical psychology, and public 
health)."  Pregnancy is not a disease.  Terminating a pregnancy terminates the life of 
the baby.  That is not maintaining or restoring health.  The Hippocratic Oath says, 
"First, do no harm."  Abortion not only harms the baby, it kills the baby, and often 
leaves the mother with physical and emotional harm.
I do not want my tax dollars to be used to terminate human life.  If you were asked to 
contribute to a fund, and one of the purposes for which that fund was used was to 
murder innocent children, would you contribute?  Yet science proves that from the 
moment of conception, there is a new life within the mother, a life that is distinct from
her own, with the ability to take in nourishment, to grow, to move, and with the 
genetic information to pass on to another life.  That life is not a giraffe, or a spinach 
plant, it is a human life with human DNA.  Please, Please, do not take my tax dollars 
and use them to murder innocent children.
