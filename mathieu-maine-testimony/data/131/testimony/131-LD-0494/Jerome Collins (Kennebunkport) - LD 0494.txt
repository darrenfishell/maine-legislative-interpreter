LD 494
To: All Members of the Judiciary Committee
     I support LD 494 An Act to conform state funding  to the Federal Hyde 
Amendment, limiting funding for some abortion services.  This bill would reduce 
Maine taxpayer costs for the small minority of women who seek abortions (1095 per 
year).  It would lead to a reduction in insurance premium costs, and free taxpayers 
from forced payment for a service they never use and for which they have moral 
objections.
     LD 494 Ought to pass.
