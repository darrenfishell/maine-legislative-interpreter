RE: LD 1449 â€“ An Act to Amend the Laws Regarding Violatio ns of  
 Conditions of Release  
        
Dear Senator Carney, Representativ e Moonen , and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary,  
 
MACDL supports  LD 1449. 
 
As it stands now, if you are on ba il for a felony offense, even if you commit the most 
minor misdeme anor crimes, then you are subject to a new felony level charge for 
violation of conditions of release.  
 
Certainly, violation of conditions of release is a ser ious crime, but the fact that 
someone is on bail for a felony crime is really irrelevant to the issue of whether 
committing a minor new crime while on bail should subject a person to full-blown 
felony consequences.  
 
This law needs to be changed.  Fairness dictates that the punishment should meet the 
crime, and the punishment here for a Class E misdeme anor being elevated to a felony 
level crime does not in fact fit the crime.  
 
Thank you f or the opportunity to address this issue.  
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
Walter F. McKee  
Chair, Legi slative Committee
