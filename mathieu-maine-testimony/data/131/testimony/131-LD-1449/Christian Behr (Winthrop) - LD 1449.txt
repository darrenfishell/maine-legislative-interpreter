Re: LD1449 – An Act to Am end the Law R egarding Violation of C onditions of Release  
Dear Senator Carney, R epresentative Moonen and Members of the Judiciary Committee  
I would like to tell you I do NOT support LD 1 449. 
As the law currently stands if you are on bail for a felony, i t is not necessarily a felo ny violation of your 
bail if you commit  another crime.  It de pends on a two -prong test.  Many offenders are arrested for a 
class C felony only in d omestic violence c rimes where they contact their victim or f amily member or 
witness.  These must con tinue to be enforced.   
When a person on bail for a felony DV crime commits  say an O UI or OAS or another misdemeanor  crime, 
they are only also charged with a misdemeanor VCR.  I think taking a way the f elony charge is a mistake 
which will enable  more c riminal defendants to skirt the no contact clause of their bail concerning 
victims.  We need to continue to protect victims of all crime, but s pecifically D V’s, sex abuse and other 
fami ly type crimes.  
Continuing to enforce these felony le vel offenses is an important aspect of the bail code.   
Please do not allow these changes to pass. Thank you.
