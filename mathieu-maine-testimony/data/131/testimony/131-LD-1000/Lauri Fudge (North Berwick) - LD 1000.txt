As a resident that lives within a half mile of an active shooting range that has grown 
in population and frequency over the last 11 years, I strongly urge the department to 
put the necessary regulations in place to continually monitor and evaluate the safety 
of gun ranges. In the last few years we have found bullets on our property that are in 
direct trajectory of the range. We have not found bullets on any part of our property 
that is not in the direct trajectory of the range. These ranges should operate with the 
safety of surrounding citizens at the forefront of it's code of conduct. It's very 
disconcerting to know that our local ranges are not staffed or monitored and that 
many are run on an honor system. Should those stray bullets continue to cause 
property damage or worse, there is not currently a viable way to trace them back to 
members of the range to enforce better safeguards.
