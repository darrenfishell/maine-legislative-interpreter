Amanda & Lenny Daigle, 165 Randall Road, North Ben/vick ME 
RE: Shooting Range,Sanford-Springvale Fish & Game Protective Agency 
Dear Committee Members, 
There have been a trail of complaints against Ben/vick ’s shooting range, 
SSFGPA, dating as far back as 2004, when it started ramping up after they 
purchased it from General Electric Employee Association. 
Like everyone else, in the border town of North Ben/vick & Berwick area of the 
range, the noise is horrible and it is irritating. We have particularly noticed an 
increase in activity, with automatic and loud, booming guns, these past few years. 
We cannot enjoy our yard like we did when we ﬁrst moved here. 
The stray bullets worry us tremendously, especially since ‘a stray bullet already hit 
our housel The bullet that hit our house is only 8 feet away from our front porch 
and door. Does someone have to be hurt, before someone will do something? 
What can be done to keep the noise from the shooting range to a minimum? 
Why are they able to expand and grow, without any oversight or permits? 
Why are they able to host many shooting competitions that last all weekend 
long? This is terrible noise pollution. It is not fair to the 21 plus homes in the area. 
Why can't Ben/vick do more? We are concerned for our safety. We are in the 
direct trajectory of their berm. There is a VERY high probability the bullets came 
from SSFGPA’s Shooting Range. Hunters don't use our woods for shooting. 
We are one of three houses that have been hit by errant bullets on Randall Road. 
All three homeowners are certain that they had to have come from their range. 
Our hope is that laws, across the state, will change and hours of operation for 
shooting ranges will not be allowed to shoot 365 days per year, dawn to dusk, 
with special consideration paid to residential areas. Compromises are necessary! 
Sincerely,
