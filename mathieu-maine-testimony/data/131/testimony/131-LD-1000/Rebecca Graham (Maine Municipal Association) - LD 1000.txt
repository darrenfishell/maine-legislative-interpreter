ln Support For 
LD 1000 - Resolve, to Convene a Firearm Range Safely Working Group Within the Department of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife 
April 19, 2023 
Sen. LaFountain, Rep. Landry and distinguished members ofthe Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and l am providing testimony in support for LD 1000, Resolve, 
to Convene a Firearm Range Safety Working Group Within the Department of Inland Fisheries and 
Wildlife on behalf of Maine Municipal Association and at the direction of our 70 member Legislative 
Policy Committee. 
Municipal ofﬁcials in some communities must regularly ﬁeld complaints from new residents or 
adjacent neighbors regarding the operation of ﬁrearm ranges. However, they are important resources for 
local public safety training, a location for safe learning and training to promote responsible gun 
ownership, and important for hunting enthusiasts to responsibly prepare their weapons for hunting season. 
Many municipalities would struggle to ﬁnd public will to open a new ﬁrearm range which often 
provide not only a much safer space than a back yard alternative, but also often meet federal 
environmental protection standards for operation thus localizing and mitigating potential environmental 
effects. 
For these reasons, ofﬁcials appreciate that municipalities would be included in any working group 
to examine real or perceived issues in balance with local needs and desires.
