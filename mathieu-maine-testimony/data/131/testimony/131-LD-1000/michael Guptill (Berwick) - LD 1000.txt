MY name is Michael Guptill and I live in Berwick beside an extremely noisy and 
dangerous gun range.  This range itself is proof that the gun ranges in general need to 
have much more accountability.
When the neighborhood range first opened it was a fun spot for a local gun club to  
practice simple target shooting, but now it has transformed itself into an extremely 
busy hub of constant rapid fire and high caliber weapons.  It has outgrown the 
neighborhood but uses it's grandfathered status to continue to grow (in number of 
users) with little concern with neighbors.  A dozen years ago it would be frequented 
by a few sportsman every weekend  - today it is a constant source of semi - automatic 
weapon fire, and invitational shooting games.  
The number of users have gone up by hundreds of percent , while the number of 
rounds fired have gone up by tens of thousands of percent.  As the numbers of rounds 
have multiplied, so have the numbers of mistakes and stray bullets.  Calibers of the 
weapons used have also gone up dramatically. This type of change should not go 
unchallenged by local officials.  A Firearm Range Safety working group seems to be 
only a first step in the right direction.
