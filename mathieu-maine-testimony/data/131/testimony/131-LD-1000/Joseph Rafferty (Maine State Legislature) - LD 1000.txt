Senator, District 34 13 l st Legislature Augusta. Maine 04333 
Testimony 0fSenator Joe Rqﬂerty in Support of 
LD 1000, “Resolve, to Convene a Firearm Range Safety Working Group Within the 
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife ” 
Before the Senate Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
Wednesday, April 19, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, my name is Joe Rafferty and I proudly represent the 
people of Senate District 34 including Berwick, North Berwick, Wells, Kennebunk and 
Kennebunkpoit. 
I’m submitting testimony in support of LD 1000, “Resolve, to Convene a Firearm Range 
Safety Working Group Within the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife ” 
The group shall study whether ﬁrearm ranges have access to the most current standards 
regarding and information on ensuring the safe operation of ﬁrearm ranges and any possible 
improvements to ﬁrearm range safety statewide. 
This year I’ve had numerous contacts from residents within my district expressing safety issues 
relative to a local range. Real or perceived, I’m not here to discuss that issue. I do believe that 
this working group has potential to ease the minds of all stakeholders as well as offering 
opportunity for range users and community members that safety is forefront among them all. 
Thank you for listening and please support LD 1000. I’m happy to answer any questions the 
committee may have. 
Joe Rafferty 
Senate District 34
