Dear Committee Members,
I have owned/operated my business for many years.  This is how I chose to provide 
for my family, and I take it very seriously.  A full flavor ban on tobacco products is a 
killer.  The market basket effect from these products is huge.  People come to buy all 
sorts of things from my store, but tobacco is almost always a part of that, and I fear 
that if I am no longer able to sell these products then my business could be seriously 
crippled.  It is extremely difficult to run a business these days with all of the rules and 
regulations and costs.  The government takes and takes on all levels, and in the end 
we the retailers make less money each year with more headaches.  It is amazing to me
that our state wants to ban flavored tobacco products after we have all had time to see 
the results of Massachusetts flavor ban.  The people are still getting the products they 
like and enjoy they are just doing it in a neighboring state.   This committee would be 
foolish to think the same won't happen here.   Please do not hurt small businesses in 
Maine only to help similar businesses in New Hampshire.  You were elected to help 
small businesses please do so and stop this process in its tracks vote NO on this ban!
Sincerely
