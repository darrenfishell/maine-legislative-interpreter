Testimony
in
Opposition
to
LD
1558,
“An
Act
to
Prohibit
the
Sale
of
Tobacco
Products
in
Pharmacies
and
Retail
Establishments
Containing
Pharmacies”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1558.
If
there
is
any
doubt
of
the
ineffectiveness
and
absurdity
of
modern-day
Prohibition,
whether
on
the
state
level,
local
level,
or
individual
firm
level,
please
consult
the
historical
literature
on
the
effects
of
alcohol
and
drug
prohibition
in
the
United
States
before
casting
a
vote
on
this
bill
and
others
heard
today.
Maine
Policy
Institute's
testimony
on
LDs
1174
and
1215
outlined
why
the
specific
policy
of
banning
tobacco
products
will
surely
backfire—because
it
already
has
in
Massachusetts.
The
economic
realities
underlying
the
failure
of
Prohibition
has
not
changed.
The
irony
is
not
lost
on
us
to
find
self-ascribed
progressives,
those
who
fashion
themselves
champions
of
the
working
class
and
downtrodden
minority
groups
of
society,
proclaiming
to
be
the
saviors
of
these
groups
by
merely
passing
a
legal
prohibition
on
their
preferred
products.
These
bills
will
do
nothing
but
unnecessarily
expose
more
Mainers
to
the
criminal
justice
system.
Lawmakers
like
the
sponsor
of
LD
1558
should
see
that.
This
bill,
for
no
other
reason,
looks
to
be
a
simple
feel-good
measure
for
certain
lawmakers
to
demonstrate
their
virtue
to
deep-pocketed
activist
groups
from
California
which
have
bankrolled
a
massive
effort
to
ban
flavored
tobacco
and
other
similar
products
in
markets
across
the
nation.
Telling
pharmacies
like
Walgreens,
CVS,
or
Rite-Aid,
as
well
as
other
businesses
with
pharmacies
within
their
doors,
like
Hannaford
or
Walmart,
that
they
may
no
longer
sell
tobacco
products,
will
do
nothing
to
reduce
rates
of
smoking
or
demand
for
these
products
in
Maine--for
either
adults
or
children.
Noble
intentions
are
not
a
real
solution.
Please
swiftly
deem
LD
1558
“Ought
Not
To
Pass”
and
focus
your
efforts
on
reducing
the
burden
of
the
state
government
on
everyday
Mainers.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
