 April 1  April 5, 2023  RE: LD 593 An Act to Increase the Bag Limit for Smelts for Personal Use from 2 Quarts to 4 Quarts  Dear Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, and Members of the Committee on Marine Resources,  We are writing in opposition to LD 593 and request that you vote ought not to pass on this bill. Smelt fishing has long been a popular recreational activity in Maine and while we understand the underlying interest in supporting expanding recreational and delicious culinary opportunities, we believe that this bill is misguided. First, we are concerned about the process by which this bill is being moved forward. We respectfully note that specific regulations in this level of detail, i.e. daily bag limits for a specific species, would be better managed through rulemaking by the agency authorized to do so. Second, in the case of smelt, we find it concerning that a broad approach is being considered the highly variable and, in many cases, imperiled species.   In 2012 “A Regional Conservation Plan for Anadromous Rainbow Smelt in the U.S. Gulf of Maine was released, (accessed on 04/04/2023 at: https://www3.epa.gov/region1/npdes/schillerstation/pdfs/AR-350.pdf). The report shows that efforts have been underway to improve habitat and access to habitat for smelt, to ensure their continued viability. These efforts include improving aquatic connectivity by removing dams and installing appropriately sized and placed road culverts. A great deal of progress has been made in collecting and sharing information about these barriers, but there remains a great deal of work to do to improve the outlook for the future of Maine’s smelt. And in many parts of the State, smelt populations in are decline or have already become extirpated. The conclusions of the 2012 plan are worth reviewing, they would not lead one to believe that a broad doubling the recreational bag limit for smelt is based on good science or good management.   We would support efforts to update formal assessments of smelt populations in Maine.  Sincerely,  Landis Hudson Maine Rivers Executive Director
