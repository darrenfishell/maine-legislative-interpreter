Testlmony of Senator J1ll Duson 1ntroduc1ng LD I 759, “An Act to Clarzﬁ» the Dzsabzlzty 
Retzrement Program of the Mame Publzc Employees Retzrement System” 
Before the Jo1nt Stand1ng Commrttee on Labor and Houslng 
May 3, 2023‘ 
Senator Trppmg, Representatrve Roeder, and Dlstmgurshed Colleagues on the J o1nt Standlng 
Commrttee on Labor and Houslng, my name rs I111 Duson I represent Senate D1str1ct 27, wh1ch 
rncludes parts of Westbrook and Portland I am here to speak 1n favor of LD 1759, “An Act to 
Clanfy the D1sab1l1ty Retrrement Program of the Marne Publ1c Employees Retlrement System” 
Th1s legrslatlon would change three aspects of the current law pertammg to the Mame Publlc 
Employees Retrrement System (MePERS) First, thrs b1ll would clarrfy “garnful occupatron ” and 
“galnful act1v1t1es ” to mean “Work done by the retlree for pay or for the generatlon of proﬁt 
pr1mar1ly by means of the ret1ree’s own product1ve work actrvrty ” Second, LD 1759 would 
requ1re MePERS to conslder medlcal and vocatronal ev1dence 1n determmmg whether a 
d1sab1l1ty retrrement rec1p1ent has the capaclty to engage 1n “substantlally gamful act1v1ty” 
Thrrd, thrs legrslatron would requlre MePERS to publrsh an annual report to the Leg1slature to 
provrde statlstrcs about the suspensron, reducnon, and termrnatron of d1sab1l1ty retlrement 
beneﬁts 
A remamlng long-standrng, unaddressed problem 1n MePERS’s mterpretatlons of the govermng 
statutes 1n ways that needlessly result 1n the stress of threatened and sometlmes actual ﬁnanclal 
dlsaster faced by MePERS d1sab1l1ty retlrees after they have been approved for d1sab1l1ty 
retlrement beneﬁts Due to MePERS’s stramed mterpretatrons of the govermng statutes, 
d1sab1l1ty retrrees are caught off-guard to ﬁnd the1r d1sab1l1ty retlrement payments suspended, 
reduced, or termmated, far too often wrth the requrrement to pay bacl< d1sab1l1ty retlrement 
beneﬁts recerved, plus rnterest 
Th1s legrslatlon would ensure that those who rely on these beneﬁts, recelve them 
Thank you for ‘ your t1me and consrderatlon I would be happy to answer any questrons, but I may 
defer some questrons to Sue Hawes, who w1ll be speakmg after me\
