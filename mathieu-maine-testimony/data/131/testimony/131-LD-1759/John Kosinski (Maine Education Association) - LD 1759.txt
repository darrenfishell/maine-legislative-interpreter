Before the Labor and Housing Committee 
May 3, 2023 
Senator Tlpplng, Representatwe Roeder and esteemed members of the Labor and Housmg Commrttee, 
My name 1s John Kosmskr (he/hlm) and I am proud to serve as the Drrector of Government Relatrons for 
‘ 
the Mame Educatron Assoc1at1on (MEA) The MEA represents 24,000 educators 1n the state of Mame, 
mcludlng teachers and other professlonals m nearly every publlc school 1n the state and faculty and other 
professional staff 1n the Umversiity of Mame and Commumty College Systems 
I am here to testlfy on behalf of the MEA nerther for nor aga1nstLD 1759, An Act to Clarzﬁ» the 
Dzsabzlzty Retzrement Program of the Mazne Publzc Employees Retzrement System 
There may be some posrtive elements contamed 1n LD 1759, but we are compelled to testlfy nelther for 
nor agamst because we hope to see and understand the changes made last sessron before advocatmg for 
add1t1ona1 rmprovements to the d1sab111ty retrrement program for teachers, ed techs (Hs and Ills) andI 
other publlc servants 
In the 129* and 130th Leglslative Sesslons, thls Commlttee heard drfﬁcult and heart-breakmg testrmony 
from ret1red teachers and state employees who fell through the cracks of our d1sab1l1ty system w1th1n 
Ma1nePERS To therr credit, the staff leaders at Ma1nePERS pulled together a group and useda 
consensus-based process to bnng forward changes to the d1sab1l1ty system Last sessron, th1s Commlttee 
and the Leglslature passed LD 1644, An Act T 0 Improve the Dzsabzlzty Retzrement Program of the Mame 
Publzc Employees Retzrement System The b1ll reﬂected the consensus-based changes
I 
The changes 1n LD 1644 were srgnrﬁcant and as far as we can tell the system 1s workmg far better than 
before LD 1644 was rmplemented Certamly, LD 1759 may mclude some nnprovements, but at th1s 
t1me we would be hesrtant to add any new elements unt11 we have more lnformatlon and data to better 
analyze and understand the changes that have already been made and therr rmpact on MainePERS
