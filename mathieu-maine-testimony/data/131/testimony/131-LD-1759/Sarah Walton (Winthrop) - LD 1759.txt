 1 Sarah Walton PO Box 235, Winthrop, ME 04364  May 3, 2023  Testimony in Support of LD 1759 An Act to Clarify the Disability Program of Maine Public Employees Retirement System  Dear Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing,  My name is Sarah Walton, and I am a Maine resident. I ask that you vote “ought to pass” on LD 1759. I support the entire bill. In this testimony, I will focus just on one section of the bill. Section 3 of LD 1759 makes changes to 5 MRSA §17103(11). This statute lists the data that MainePERS must submit in its annual report to this Committee.  What Section 3 of LD 1759 does is require that MainePERS provide specific information related to individuals in the disability retirement program. Specifically, MainePERS would be required to: 1. Separate out the total payout amounts paid each calendar year to service retirement members and to disability beneficiaries; [All that was reported for 2022 were the total payments to “retirees.” See MainePERS Feb. 27, 2023 Annual Report, Attach. 3 (page 45 of 49)] 2. Separate out the total numbers of service retirement members and numbers of disability beneficiaries on January 1st of the previous calendar year.  [All that was reported for 2022 were the aggregate numbers of “new retirees” for the previous calendar year. See MainePERS Feb. 27, 2023 Annual Report, Attach. 7 (page 49 of 49)] 3. Report the number of administrative decisions during the previous calendar year concerning a disability beneficiary's ability to engage in substantially gainful activity; 4. The number of disability beneficiaries who were in the MainePERS “actively seeking work” program at any time during the previous calendar year; [See 5 MRSA §17929(2)(B)(1) and MainePERS rule, Chapter 511] 5. The status of disability beneficiaries whose benefits were suspended, reduced or terminated during the previous calendar year, including: a. The number of disability beneficiaries whose benefits were suspended for failure to submit an annual statement of compensation or earnings in a timely manner; b. The number of disability beneficiaries whose benefits were reduced because they exceeded the limit of allowable annual earnings; c. The number of disability beneficiaries whose benefits were terminated because they exceeded the limit of allowable annual earnings; d. The number of appeals of decisions to suspend, reduce or terminate disability retirement benefits; and e. The results of appeals of decisions to suspend, reduce or terminate disability  retirement benefits. Currently, 5 MRSA §17103(11) does not require MainePERS to submit data about the experience of MainePERS members after they are approved for disability retirement benefits. Instead, the statute requires data (numbers of approvals, denials, and appeals) only about applications for disability retirement benefits. See 5 MRSA §17103(11)(J); See, also the February 27, 2023 Annual Report, Attachment 4 (page 46 of 49). Although Attach. 4 is titled “Disability Retirement and Appeals,” the document concerns only applications for disability retirement benefits. That report has a section entitled “Disability Services” but concerns only implementation of PL 2021 ch. 277 and MainePERS resulting survey of 27 individuals whose applications for disability retirement had been processed less than a year earlier (12 responded). See pages 8-9. No other survey was done of disability retirees. In a separate survey, MainePERS surveyed 2,500 service (regular) retirees (some of whom likely had once been disability retirees. See Attachment 1, pages 11-12.  
 2 The first page of the MainePERS 49-page February 27, 2023, Annual Report, states: The System’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), copies of which have been provided to the Committee and which is available at www.mainepers.org. provides detailed information that supplements this report.” [direct link: https://www.mainepers.org/reports/ or https://www.mainepers.org/wp-content/uploads/ACFR22.pdf ]  The title page for the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) contains the following: This report has been produced as required by 5 M.R.S.A. §17102 (10), which states that the Maine Public Employees Retirement System must publish an annual report showing  “the fiscal transactions of the retirement system for the fiscal year and the assets and liabilities of each of the programs of the retirement system at the end of the fiscal year; and the actuary’s report on the actuarial valuation of the financial condition of each of the programs of the retirement system for the fiscal year.”  This report was prepared by the Financial, Administrative and Investment staff of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.   If one goes to the 224-page ACFR for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 searching for “detailed information that supplements the FY 2022 Annual Report, it’s hard to find details specific to disability retirees. On pages 210 and 211, looks as though it contains data about a total number of 1,908 disability retirees. (1,908 is the total of 1,507 (State and Teacher Plan) plus 1 (Judicial Plan) plus 2 (Legislative Plan) plus 398 (PLD Plan).  In January 2023, I asked Domna Giatas, the MainePERS “Director of Communications” about the discrepancy between the 1,908 ACFR figure from the FY 2022 ACFR (pp. 210-211) and the figure of “approximately 1,000 disability retirees” provided by MainePERS staff during the January 12, 2023 meeting of the MainePERS Board of Trustees Meeting. (The phrase “approximately 1,000 disability retirees” was also used  on page 6 of the November 1, 2021 MainePERS Program Evaluation Report.)  Ms. Giatas consulted with Ms. Morin, the MainePERS “Manager of Actuarial and Legislative Affairs” and then told me that the “approximately 1,000” figure was correct and that what was shown in the ACFR 2022 on those pages were actuarial numbers, not actual numbers. Ms. Giatas told me that that the difference was related to what a high-level MainePERS executive refers to as “actuarial alchemy.”   At the top of page 2 of a 72-page MainePERS report submitted to this Committee on January 31, 2023, MainePERS states: “As shown in graph 2 below, there are 1,022 members currently receiving a disability retirement benefit.” The graph shows that the total number of members receiving a disability retirement benefit in calendar year 2014 was 1,530 and, in calendar year 2022, the number had dropped from 1530 to 1,022. The report provides no explanation for the precipitous drop in the number of disability retirees. “Disability Retirement Experience Report: Public Law 2021, c. 277, Sec. 44, January 2023.” This document may be located on the MainePERS website at https://www.mainepers.org/wp-content/uploads/Disability-Retirement-Experience-Report_012723_FINAL.pdf  Section 3 of LD 1759 will provide this Committee missing data about the numbers of individuals receiving MainePERS disability retirement benefits, the total pay out to them, and the impact of MainePERS decision-making upon individuals after their disability retirement benefits have been approved.  I ask that you vote ought to pass on LD 1759. Thank you.   Sarah Walton PO Box 235 Winthrop, ME 04364
