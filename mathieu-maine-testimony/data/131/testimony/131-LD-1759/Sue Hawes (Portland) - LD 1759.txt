Good afternoon, Sen. Tipping, Rep Roeder, and to all the distinguished members of the 
Labor and Housing Committee My name 1S Sue Hawes and I live in Portland I am testifying in 
support of Sen Duson’s bill and ask that you vote “ought to pass” on LD 1759 
Without the clarifications provided by LD 1759, MainePERS will continue making 
misinterpretations of the statutes governing continued eligibility of disability retirement 
beneficiaries —,such as my husband of thirty years 1 Aware or not, they and their families 
remain under the constant threat of suspension, reduction, or termination of the disability 
retirement beneﬁt 2‘ 
My fears are reasonable based upon how MainePERS has applied its statutory 
interpretations in past administrative decisions and MainePERS recent rulemakiiig which went 
into effect in March 2023 " ’ 
My husband had been receiving Social Security Disability since about 1998 when, in‘ 
2006, he realized he hadn’t had an epileptic seizure in two years and voluntarily left SSDI 
seeking employment as a Corrections Officer at Cumberland County Jail He was hired and 
worked there for about ten years, earning Master Corrections Officer status and he was 
promoted to Deputy Sheriff in 2010 His August 2015 Performance Review identified him asa 
potential future supervisor 
However, at age 48, he was declared permanently disabled by MHJOT Neurocognitive 
Disorder due to Epilepsy (“dementia, ” short-term memory loss, etc.). Although his disability 
may be invisible to onlookers, my husband’s disability bars him from being able to work or be 
self-employed. My husband’s disability is cognitive impairment due to a lifetime of epilepsy 
and brain damage observable on a CT Scan in 2016 Hisdernentia is not going to heal, it will

only get worse And his seizures occur more often when he is under stress See the attached 
nationwide CDC study which found that “Among adults with disabilities, the highest 
prevalence of frequent mental distress were in New Hampshire (42.9%), South Carolina 
(39 2%), and Mam (38 7%)3 
Among the facts in our situation that could lead to MainePERS ’s statutory 
misinterpretations terminating my husband’s MainePERS disability retirement income are the 
following 
1 Rental Income Our ,_]OlI1lI tax return reﬂects rental income. My husband and I live in an 
owner’-occupied apartment building with three apartments that I own Since my 
husband’s catastrophic number of seizures in early 2016 after staffing cuts at the Jail, 
and while now his caregiver, I now also do much of the work he used to do on property 
maintenance myself or I hire contractors If he |is feeling up to it, my husband 
occasionailly helps; but it’s a far cry from the independent and reliable handyman he was 
for the rental property between 2004-2015 
2 “Farming” income, perhaps considered “partnership 1ncome” under a possiblev 
MainePERS misinterpretation My husband, along with l'11S\ siblings and father, 
inherited a farm Income from the farm is expected to come primarily from a company 
installing wind turbines for what people call “wind farming” 
3 Book royalties My husband ﬁnished writing a book in 2004 He was a farm laborer and 
mechanic from age 8-16 He has a limited education and didn’t learn how to read and 
write until his late teens His life story, The People and the Idiots Survzvmg a Cult\ 
Childhood, was‘ 
published in 2019 with major help from many others4 
Right now, the outcome of continuing eligibility reviews is dependent upon both 
1) MainePERS ’s opaque, and ad hocstatutoiy misinterpretations, and 2) how MainePERS» 
chooses to interpret its overly broad and vague new rule, Chapter 506 Eligibility for Disability 
Retirement Benefits

MainePERS likes to point to how courts have generally —although not always — upheld 
its interpretations of the statutes and its rules However, courts are constrained by a judicial 
standardof review that is highly deferential to an agency’s interpretation of a statute that it 
administers 5 
Offered during the January and February 2023 rulemaking enacting Chapter 506, 
MainePERS, without providing any reason for doing so, rejected public comment 
recommendations that mirror the language ‘ contained in LD 17596 
Only the Legislature can address this unnecessary threat to the abilityof affectedH 
individuals eligible for disability retirement beneﬁts to afford basic necessities suchjas food, 
housing, medications, medical treatment, medical equipment, health insurance, and personal 
care Since my husband stopped working due to his disability, we have paid over $120,000 just 
in health insurance premiums to Maine Municipal Health Trust and tliat’s‘ despite his Medicare 
coverage kicking in November 2018 We pay more monthly just for our health insurance 
premiums than my husband receives in monthly MainePERS disability retirement beneﬁts7 
LD 1759 will help MainePERS and the public have a clearer understanding of two 
things 
Bust, what forms of income received by a disability benefit recipient are subject or not 
subject to what MainePERS calls the “annual earnings limit”? [Note' Even if a disability retiree 
remains "disabled" as defined by the statutes, exceeding this so-‘called “annual earnings limit” 
can result in the termination of disability benefits.] 
Second, MainePERS will consider vocational evidence, as well as medical evidence, 
before MainePERS determines that disability retirees no longer qualify for disability retirement 
based upon its decision that the retirees have the ability to earn at least the “annual earnings 
l1mit,” even though they have not done so Vocational and medical evidence will be used in 
determining whether a beneficiary has the physical, mental, and vocational capabilities to 
perform substantially gainful activity

LU 1759 DEFJINES GAINFUL UCQUPATION/ACTEVITY 
Consistent witiiieurrent statutes, LD i759 will deﬁne “gairifui oecupatioii ” 
and “gainful activity ” as “worlr done by a retiree for pay or for the generation oi’ 
proﬁt primarily by means of the retir'ee ’s own productive work activity. ” 
NOTE For an Excel spreadsheet and printed Summary of Statutes using the terms “gainful 
activity ” and “gainful occupation, ” see Background Materials binder and electronic files 
Based on the language of the current statutes, the law reasonably allows for the 
reduction, suspension, ‘or termination of the benefit if he receives compensation from engaging 
in “any gainful occupation ” or “any gainful activity ” The earnings limitation amount (also 
referred to as the “substantially gainful activity amount”) 1S either $20,000, or 80% of the 
member’s average final compensation, whichever 1S greater, &d _]11S’[6Cl by any cost-of-living 
adjustments required by law MainePERS rule, Chapter 5o6(1)(14), 5 MRSA §18531, 5 MRSA 
§18529(2)(B), 5 MRSA §18530(2) ,, 
Clarification by the Legislature is needed. MainePERS expands the expected 
interpretation of “compensation ” from engaging in any gainful occupation or activity to include 
a broad range of what MainePERS calls “earnings ” MainePERS has included as “earnings ” 
foster parent reimbursements, passive and mostly passive income from‘ capital investment in 
farms, rental property and other real estate’,'partnership shares,‘ 
and imputed income , 
(employer —pa1d benefits taxable to employee) MainePERS has taken the following position “If 
someone can earn money, regardless of the source, they no longer need disability retirement 
benefits That’s the bottom line ”8 ‘
~ 
It’s as though MainePERS views disability retirement benefits as a form of means-tested 
welfare Yet, in planning for retirement, including the possibility of disability retirement, 
people are generally encouraged to build a “three-legged stool” of I‘61IlI‘eI‘l’1€1’1t‘111CO1'1 ‘l6 sources 
by contributing to retirement accounts and accumulating other savings and income producing 
assets throughout their lives For a secure retirement, workers are implored to avoid relying on 
Just Social Security income or, in the case of most Maine state employees who do not pay into 
Social Security, implored to avoid relying solely on MainePERS retirement income 
Every year MainePERS appears to require every disability retiree to report 7§ﬁ 
gf income, Tl0f_]USl ” “compensation ” as directed by the statutes Through the Annual Statement 
of Compensation form, MainePERS expands the statutory requirement to include “all income” 
and “any other sources of income” and gives as examples “rentals, partnerships, farming,

contract work, etc ” In binder, see the 2022 Annual Statement of Compensation and original 
envelope mailed to a disabled retiree in January 2023 
Furthermore, if the disability retiree ﬁles a Joi im federal income tax return, MainePERS 
requires that the retiree submit a copy of the tax return with all schedules and forms “such as 
W-2s and 1o99s” for Q individuals on the Joint return by the date that the federal tax return 
is due 
Despite the fact that lie has no “compensation from gainful occupation, ” 
nor an ability to engage in gainful occupation or activity, every year with a hard deadline, I 
have to mail to MainePERS all these documents and the completed MainePERS Annual 
Statement of Compensation by the date that our federal tax return is due And every year,I 
worry about this because, in addition to worrying about how MainePERS might interpret 
what’s on those tax returns, there’s another fear. IfI fail to get all this to MainePERS on time 
for whatever reason, MainePERS will immediately and permanently withhold my husband’s 
beneﬁt payment for every month that the filing is late — even if the report shows that he had no 
compensation from any gainful occupation 9
\ 
In December 2022, when MainePERS proposed Chapter 506 governing continued 
eligibility for disability benefits, the rule contained the following statement in its definition of 
“earnings ” “absent evidencei to the contrary, net rental income from real estate is considered 
earnings and will be allocated equally among owners” 
Although in response to public comment about the unfairness of such a presumption, 
MainePERS chose to delete the statement when the Board adopted the final MainePERS rule 
Chapter 506 In deleting the sentence. the Board didn’t say it would no longer count rental 
income as earnings, only that it was deleting "the suggestion of a presumption on real estate 
income”< 
LD 1759 REQUERES VUQATEONAL EVKDENEEQNOT JUST MEDICAL ' 
EVIDENCE, WHEN DETEMINING CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY 
MainePERS will consider vocational evidence, as well as medical evidence, before 
Ma1nePERS determines that ‘disability retirees no longer qualify for disability retirement based 
upon its decision that the retirees have the ability to earn at least the “annual earnings limit,” 
even though they have not done so Vocational and medical evidence will be used in 
determining whether a beneficiary has the physical, mental, and vocational capabilities to 
perform substantially gainful activity 1° ’ ‘ ' A ' ‘

In the recent rulemaklng, Ma1nePERS responded to public comment recommend1ng the 
1nclus1on of vocat1onal ev1dence by stat1ng, “The commenter opmed that the def1n1t1on of 
‘substantlally gatnful actlvlty ’ is too broad and that Ma1nePERS should conslder 'med1ca1 and 
vocatlonal evldence 1n determlmng whether the beneflclary has the phys1cal, mental, and 
vocatlonal capablhtles to perform substantlally gamful actlvlty ' 
Staff believes the 
proposed deﬁnition is consistent with statute and closely ahgns vv1th current Rule 
Chapter 507 [repealed durlng same rulemaklng act1v1ty] and notes that €V1d6I1C€ of the sort 
1dent1f1ed by the commenter may be consldered by Ma1nePERS under the proposed rule Staff 
does not recommend any changes to the proposed rule based on th1s comment, and the Board 
concurs" - - -V 
CONCLUSIUN 
W1thout LD 1759’s clarlficatlons to the statutes, I am left with constant worry as to how 
Ma1nePERS mlght declde to termmate and even potentlally claw back my husband’s d1sab111ty 
beneﬁt based on how 1t or a Heanng Offlcer chooses to mterpret thestatutes I could have th1s 
worry welghmg on me for the next seventeen years, unt1l my husband reaches age 70 in 2040 
and hlS Ma1nePERS disablhty retlrement beneﬁt ﬁnally converts to a regular servlce retlrement

interpretations —- sometimes based in written rules, sometimes only discernable after the 
disability retiree receives a Chief Executive Officer decision and hires an attorney to read 
case law and to read previous Board decisions 
4, MainePERS interprets “compensation ” received by dsahility reepieiits as 
including broad range of types of income, including passive income. 
Maine statutes allow for the reduction, suspension, or termination of disability 
retirement benefits if the disability retirement recipient also receives compensation from 
engaging in “any gainful occupation ” (in some of the statutes, “any gainful activity ”) that 
exceeds specified limits in a calendar year This seems reasonable. However, MainePERS 
expands the expected interpretation of “compensation ” to include “earnings ” from foster 
parent reimbursements, imputed income, passiveand mostly passive income from capital 
investment in or inheritance of farms, rental property and other real estate, partnership 
shares, and possibly other sorts of income
i 
MainePERS asserts its authority to include such a broad range of types of income that 
can lead to the termination of disability retirement payments/by taking the following 
position “If someone can earn money, regardless of the source, they no longer need 
disability retirement benefits That’s the bottom line ”1

MainePERS expands upon the statutory requirement so as to require each disability retiree\
, 
to specify not only self-employment income and wages from employment but also “any 
other sources of income” and gives as examples on the Annual Statement of Compensation 
form “rentals, partnerships, farming, contract work, etc” 
If the disability retiree files a federal income tax return jointly, MainePERS requires him 
or herto submit a copy of the tax return with all schedules and forms (“such as W-2s, 
1099s”) for b_oth individuals on the Joint return by the date that the federal tax return 1S 
due See LD 1759 Binder of Background Materials Sec. [6] for MainePERS Earnings

by defining “any gainful occupation ” and “any gainful activity ” as “work done by the 
retiree for pay or for the generation of profit primarily by means of the retiree’s own 
productive work activity” 
B. Require MainePERS to eonsider medical and veeationai evidence in 
determining whether a disability retirement recipient has the capacity to 
engge in “siibstan ﬁall§Lgaiiifiil activity] Second, LD 1759 would require 
MainePERS to consider medical and vocational evidence in determining whether 
disability retirement benefits may continue Under the applicable statutes, disability

beneﬁts, The ﬁnal thing that LD 1759 would do is require that MainePERS annual 
report to the Joint standing committee of Jurisdiction (Labor & Housing) include 
information about changes to the status of disability retirees Ctirrently, the MainePERS 
annual report to the Legislature only contains data related to

Notes on Talking Points 
For MainePERS recent [2022-P228] rulemaking documents discussed, see Binder Sec [7]2 
In Talking Point MA) above, the language in LD 1759 was recommended through 
public comments delivered to the Board of Trustees at the January 12, 2023, Public 
Hearing on the proposed new rule Chapter 506 Eligibility for ‘Disability Retirement Benefits 
and submitted written comments 
The Board stated in its written response (“Basis Statement ”) that "the commenter opined 
that the [proposed Chapter 506(1)(4)] should be clarified to include only income ‘generated 
by ' 
the retiree's own productive work activity " 
Ma1nePERS gave no reason for rejecting 
that language 
In response to additional recommendations by the sole public commenter, MainePERS 
did, however, delete 
(1) language in the proposed rule that would have included in "earnings" any "non- 
wage net income received in return for goods ;" and 
(2) what MainePERS called "the suggestion of a presumption on real estate income" 
The deleted Chapter 5o6(1)(4) proposed language had stated that "Absent evidence 
to the contrary, net rental income from real estate is considered earnings and will 
be allocated equally among owners" 
2 This new rule Chapter 506 sets forth the standards and processes for determining eligibility for 
disability retirement beneﬁts The four documents include the Proposed Rule, Public Comments, 
MainePERS Response (Basis Statement), and revised rule for adoption

Talkiiig Point MB) The Board's response to item 6(B) above was that considering_ 
"evidence of the sort identiﬁed by the commenter may be considered by MainePERS under 
the proposed rule ” The Board's written response also included the following. "The 
commenter opined that the definition of ‘substantially gainful activity ’ is too broad and that 
lVlainePERS should consider ‘medical and vocational evidence in determining whether the 
beneficiary has the physical, mental, and vocational capabilities to perform substantially 
gainful activity ' 
Staff believes the proposed deﬁnition is consistent with statute 
and closely aligns with current Rule Chapter 507 [repealed during same rulemaking 
activity] and notes that evidence of the sort identified by the commenter may be considered 
by MainePERS under the proposed rule Staff does not recommend any changes to the 
proposed rule based on this comment, and the Board concurs," 
Talking Point MC) As an example of how little information is provided by MainePERS 
of the experience of disability retirees, although Title 5 MRSA §171o3(11)(K) requires 
MainePERS to conduct membership satisfaction surveys, MainePERS chose to conduct 
only a survey of active (still employed) members and members who were receiving service 
(regular) retirement benefits MaiiiePERS gave no reason for omitting those who were 
receiving disability retirement benefits See Disability Retirement Experience Report and 
Member Satisfaction Survey in Binder Sec [8].V

Summary of the Problem 
A Maine statutes reasonably limit the amount of compensation for engaging in any gainful 
occupation (or gainful activity) that a disability retirement beneficiary may receive ina 
calendar year without having his or her beneﬁts being reduced or terminated However, the 
new MainePERS rule Chapter 506 (effective March 1, 2023) allows MainePERS to continue 
its long-standing practice of having wide-ranging discretion as to what constitutes 
“earnings ” to be counted in applying the statutorily created annual earnings limitations Ch 
506 defines earnings as “wages and non-wag’ e income received in return for labor or 
services, such as received in self-employment ” Chi 506 deﬁnes “substantially gainful 1 
activity, ” in part, as “any combination of activities, tasks or efforts that would generate 
annual income ” Ch 506 (1)(13l 
MainePERS interprets the statutory phrase “compensation from engaging in any 
gainful activity or employment ” to include things such as income from capital investment 
or inherited assets, such as ownership of farms or rental property, even when none or very 
little of the retiree’s’own current productive work activity 1S involved in the generation of 
the income‘ 
e Farming income where the physical labor 1S primarily done by someone else, (See 
discussion of Sczymecki case below) 
e Rental income generated by previous capital investment in rental properties in (See 
discussion of Courtois case below) 
e Imputed income, including employer-paid beneﬁts added to the “wages” total ona 
W-2 solely for the purpose of federal income taxation. (e g , employer-paid health 
insurance beneﬁts for a domestic partner where the MainePERS disability 
recipient ’s wages would not be increased if the domestic partner was not covered by 
the health insurance plan. (See discussion of Courtois case) 
Q Foster care reimbursement for room and board (See discussion of Pelton case)

Who Es Being impacted?‘ 
When the continuation of disability retirement benefits for which eligible seriously ill 
and disabled individuals is at risk of ending, significant stress 1S borne by them and their 
family members, especially family members who are their caregivers Under suchv 
circumstances, unnecessary stress 1S also experienced by friends, former colleagues, and 
Maine taxpayers in general, who may be called upon to fill the gap so that those individuals 
are able to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, medicine, medical treatment, 
medical equipment, health insurance, personal care, etc

Employees Retirement System provides definitions for “gainful occupation ” and

gainful activity), that means compensation for “work done by the retiree for pay or 
for the generation of proﬁt primarily by means of the retiree’s own productive Work 
activity ” This deﬁnition excludes passive and inostly passive income from capital 
investments or inheritance, such as the ownership of farms or other real estate, 
partnership shares, royalties, and other investments The definition also excludes 
imputed income, income generated from reimbursements, ‘ and income generated 
primarily through the paid or unpaid physical or mental work activities of others

MaiiiePER§ “Standards ” in Determining 
Continued Eiigibility for Disability Retirement Beneﬁts 
Following the 1993 Superior Court decision in Perr, MainePERS promulgated rules 
deﬁning “substantially gainful activity ” The MainePERS definition of “substantially gainful 
activity ” was and is so broad that it is almost no standard at all “any combination of 
activities, tasks or efforts that would generate annual income in an amount” that 1S in 
excess of [a calculated amount that varies by individual and the amount of COLA 
increases] 
MainePERS ’s new rule Chapter 506 (Eligibility for Disability Retirement Benefits) 
outlines the scheduling of reviews for continuing eligibility for disability retirement benefits 
I 
as follows 
SECTION 3 REVIEWS FOR CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY 
1 Sciieduiing of reviewer A disability retiree may be reviewed for continuing 
eligibility for disability retirement beneﬁts in the following circumstances.\ 
A The retiree has not yet had a determination that they are unable to engage in any 
substantially gainﬁil activity for which they are qualiﬁed by training, education or 
experience and at least two years have passed since the date of the determination 
that the retiree is eligible for disability retirement benefits, or‘ 
B Earnings or other information about a retiree’s activities received by MainePERS 
show that the retiree may have capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity and 
at least one year has passed since any previous review Ch 506 (3)(1) 
MainePERS rule Chapter 506 sets out the standard to be applied in determining whether a 
recipient ’s disability retirement benefit will continue, with a rebuttable presumption 
3., Standard on review, The retiree’s eligibility for retirement beneﬁts continues if3 
the retiree is unable to engage in any substantially gainﬁil GCHUZQLCIUG to functional 
limitations caused by the mental or physical conditions that were the basis for the 
initial eligibility determination or by one or more new conditions that arose from the 
conditions that were the basis for the initial eligibility determination Ch 506 (3)(3) 
I 
4 Rehiiittable presumption, A retiree is presumed to be no longer eligible for 
retirement benefits if the retiree has earned more than the 
activity amount in one or more years while receiving disability retirement benefits 
This presumption may be rebutted by information showing that the standard in 
subsection 3 is met notwithstanding these earnings Ch 506 (3)(4) 
MainePERS ’s broad discretion in applying these standards arises from very broad and 
vague definitions that Chapter 506 provides for the terms “substantially gainful activity ” 
and “earnings. ” 
Substantially gainfiil activity. “Substantially gainful activity ” means any 
combination of activities, tasks, or eﬁorts, with any reasonable accommodations, for 
which the member is qualiﬁed by training, education, or experience that would 
May 3, 2023 BACKGROUND MATERIAL Page 13 of 23 
LD 1759 (13159 An Act to Clarify the Disability Retirement Program of MainePERS 
generate annual income in an amount in excess of the substantially gainful activity 
amoiunt in the labor market for the member’s state of residence Ch 5o6(1)(13) 
A similar sort of vague standard 1S in the deﬁnition of “earnings ” which was first made 
publicly available in a MainePERS rule that became effective March 1, 2023 
Earnings “Earnings ” means wages from employment and non-wage net income 
received in return for labor or services, such as received in self-employment Ch 
506(1)(4) 
MainePERS new rule Chapter 506 creates a standard for determining the 
“substantially gainful activity amount,” although it 1S likely that a disability retirement 
beneﬁt will have to call MainePERS to find out what that amount is Ch 506(1)(14) 
Substantially gainful activity amount “Substantially gainful activity amount” 
means $20,000 or 80% of the member’s average ﬁnal compensation, whichever 1S 
greater, adjusted by any cost-of-living adjustments required by statute or rule 
According to MainePERS ’s unpublished internal policy, Disability Services Practice 
2 9 — Review of Continuing Eligibility for Disability Retirement Beneﬁts, if a specific 
disability retirement payment recipient contacts MainePERS to ask what the “substantially 
gainful activity amount” is, such an inquiry can trigger a formal review leading to the 
terniinationof disability retirement benefits For MainePERS policies, see LD 1759 Binder 
Section [5] 
Standard 4 of Disability Services Practice 2 9 — Review of Continuing Eligibility for 
Disability Retirement Benefits, adopted Feb. 2, 2022, states
\ 
“Activity Engagement Recipients may be reviewed at points in time when their 
activities indicate an ability to engage in [substantially gainful activity] Evidence of 
this ability is mainly recipient-generated based on information associated with 
requests for earnings limitations, reports of transferable skill improvement, and 
information indicating gainful capacity ”9 
According to policy 2 9, evidence is “mainly” recipient generated. As shown by the 
Board decision in John Sczyiiieck'i ’s appeal, another source of evidence is obtained by 
MainePERS through the use of private investigators. See discussion of Mr Sczyinecki ’s 
appeal below

tlnproﬁtable Antique Business Viewed as a Hobby ﬁasei Harriet Perr v. Board of Trustees, Maine State Retirement System‘ 
Perr Kennebec Superior Court Decision and Order’ 
Perr v Bd of Trustees, 1993 WL 13969253 (Me Super ), No CV-92-345 (May 7, 1993)
K 
The Maine State Retirement System (predecessor to Ma1nePERS) terminated Ms Perr’s disability retirement beneﬁts, which she had been receiving for nearly a decade on 
the basis that her unprofitable antique business was substantially gainful activity Ms Perr 
argued that her antique business was an unproﬁtable hobby 
At that time, the Retirement System had not promulgated a rule defining , 
"substantially gainful activity, ” and System“ staff and the Board were unclear as to what the 
standard should be During the administrative hearing before the Board of Trustees, the 
chairman said, “The difficulty 1S that — that we do have to sort of [ferret] out, what 
, substantial gainful employment is, and the legislature hasn’t seen fit to give us greater 
instruction on that ” The Board decided to uphold the staff decision to terminate Ms Perr’s 
disability retirement beneﬁts. 
The Superior Court stated that: 
“Ms Perr had no notice of the Board’s interpretation of the statute until 
she read the final decision As the record makes clear, neither the 
Deputy Director nor the Chairman of the Board of Trustees thought that 
any standard for determining ‘substantially gainful activity ’ had been 
articulated That absence of guidance necessarily leaves a determination 
of rights to the purely arbitrary discretion of the administrative agency 
The Board 1S expected to determine the facts and apply to those factsthe 
standard given by the legislature, the Board is not expected to determine 
both the facts and the appropriate standard to be applied, as it did in this 
case The absence of any guidance concerning the standard applicable to 
5 MRSA 17907(2)(B) deprived the Petitioner of the ability reasonably to 
determine her rights under the statute and deprived the Board of any 
valid guidelines reasonably to determine those rights based on the 
evidence ”i
' 
The Superior Court’s decision was to reverse the Retirement System’s decision to 
terminate Ms Perr’s disability retirement benefits. 
The outcomeof the Perr Superior Court appeal is highly unusual because the Court 
1S constrained by a standard of Judicial review that is highly deferential to an agency’s 
construction of a statute that 1S administered by it‘

NOTE Maine Superior Court Justice Robert Mullen includes a detailed discussion of the 
legislative history of “substantially gainful activity, ” in paragraphs 10-18 of the decision 
Ms Pelton is a MainePERS disabled retiree providing foster care Foster care 
reimbursements are the child’s resources for room and board. MainePERS terminated Ms Pelton’s disability benefit after deciding that foster care reimbursements would be assigned 
as earnings MainePERS withheld Ms Pelton’s disability benefit from 2013 to 2015 [about 
1 5 years] during the pendency of her appeals The Court determined that [MainePERS ’s] 
interpretation of 5 MRSA 17929(2) (B)(1) was an unreasonable interpretation and reversed 
the Board of Trustees ‘ d6C1SlOI1' . 
“Clearly, [MainePERS] has treated the foster care payments 
made to the Petitioner as Petitioner's own money, and that 
Petitioner's role as a foster parent should be considered "activity 
that has been ‘substantially gainful’ because Petitioner received 
annual payments related to it that exceed her (Substantially 
Gainful Activity amount These findings ﬂy in the face of the case 
law [showing that many state and federal courts have ruled that 
foster care reimbursement payments are not to be considered 
income to the foster parent] , ” Paragraph 22. 
(“After carefully and thoroughly reviewing the relevant 
statutory authority as well as the case law cited above, the 
undersigned is convinced that the Legislature would never have 
intended the result reached below, and respectfully yet firmly 
ﬁnds that [MainePERS] interpretation of the relevant statute is 
unreasonable considering the facts of this case [and case law]

and remands the matter back to 1[M&1H€PERS] with instructions 
that the Petitioner be allowed to participate in the Actively

Case: Leland Courtois vs lW81i11l@PER§\ 
Courtois Cumberland Superior Court Decision ‘(pronounced “CUR-toys ”) 
Courtois v MamePERS,_(Me Super Ct), Docket No AP-11-26 (06-11-2012) 
Courtois Board of Trustees Decision, Appeal #2010-018 
Mr Courtois was found permanently disabled by MainePERS in 1998 In 2010 
MainePERS counted as Mr Courtois ’s earnings his 2009 rental income taken from Mr Courto1s ’s federal income tax return IRS Form 1040 Schedule E “Supplemental Income and 
Loss” 
Mr. Courtois was suddenly informed by MainePERS in May 2010 that his beneﬁts 
were terminated and that he owed the System $12,361 69--the difference between his 
“earnings limitation ” and his reported “earnings ” in the prior tax year (2009) See the 
letters from MainePERS and his 2009 Annual Statement of Compensation attached to Mr. 
Courtois ’s testimony on LD 1759 S S c 
Rental income reported on Schedule E is passive income per federal tax law Rental 
property 1S a capital investment producing passive income, not “earnings ” Yet, according to 
the Board of Trustees, "1t 1S reasonable and consistent with the statute to include all the 
payments he ,received from his‘ rental properties that yearin its calculations " 
Courtois 
Board decision, p6 
The Court offered only tepid support. Justice Thomas D. Warren wrote on page five 
(5) in this Courtois decision, 
“Section 18530 does not contain a definition of compensation, but 
the agency reasonably interpreted compensation from engaging in gainful 
activity as remuneration for work performed as opposed to income from 
investments See R 25 6, 94-411 C M R ch 5o7(i)(A) 
Based on the evidence in the record, the agency could have found 
that the rental income received by Courtois in 2009 moreclosely 
resembled 1I1V6S1Il'l ’1€I1’E’1I1COI1'1 € than compensation If the court were 
evaluating the record in the first instance, it might have reached that 
l conclusion However, the court 1S not entitled to substitute its Judgment for 
, that of the agency, and there is evidence in the record to support a finding 
that Courtois performed a limited amount of work in connection with his 
three rental properties This work totaled approximately 30 hours during 
2009, a year in which none of the existing tenants moved out. 
There is no bright line separating investment income from 
compensation that can be applied to the circumstances of this case, and the 
court is therefore compelled to uphold the agency's ﬁnding that the rental 
income received by Courtois in 2009 constituted compensation from 
gainful activity ” '

The court noted that the record showed that the approximately 30 hours of work that Mr

LD 1759 provides that for purposes of disability retirement beneficiary annual earnings 
limitations, the statutory phrases “gainful activity ” and “gainful occupation ” mean “work done 
by a retiree for pay or for the generation of proﬁt primarily by means of the 
retirerfs own productive work activity. ” This excludes income generated primarily 
through the paid or unpaid physical and mental activities of others, and passive and mostly 
passive income from royalties, the ownership or inheritance of farms or other real estate or 
assets, partnership shares, investments, etc

Qase: Qourtoie vs MainePERS 
Courtois Superior Court Decision (pronounced “CUR-toys ”) 
Courtois v MainePERS,_(Me Super Ct ), Docket No AP-11-26 (11-22-2011) 
Courtois Board of Trustees Decision, Appeal #2010-018 
MainePERS includes imputed income as a disability retirement beneficiary ’ s earnings 
When MainePERS calculated the amount Mr. Courtois owed back to the System for the prior 
tax year, MainePERS included the wages amount on his W-2 in Box 1 where the employer added 
$6,934 to Mr. Courtois ’s gross W-2 wages solely for federal taxation purposes The imputed 
income constituted the value of employer-paid domestic partner’s health benefit, which is 
Sl1l) _]€Ct to federal income tax, even though the health beneﬁt is not taxable if the benefit is for an 
employee ’s spouse Generally, employer paid benefits are not considered wages If Mr Courtois 
had declined the domestic partner benefit, his take-home wages would not have increased See 
Courtois Superior Court Decision'(i1-22-2011). 
MainePERS Board insisted that the $6,934 in imputed income be counted as earnings, in 
part, to terminate Mr Courtois ’s disability retirement beneﬁt in May 2010, and in calculating 
the amount owed back to the MainePERS from Mr Courtois for a supposed “overpayment ” of 
his 2009 disability retirement benefits , , ,

In October 2021, Mrs Susan Hawes requested a MainePERS y Advisory Opinion onithe 
question, “Is imputed income considered earnings for the purpose of calculating the annual 
earnings limitation? ” The MainePERS Chief Operating Officer/ General Counsel responded, “We 
are not sure what imputed income means to you, and it is not a term we generally use in this 
context. As a result, l. am not able to answer your question. ”

€ase: John Sczyinecki vs MainePERS 
John Sczvniecki —Board of Trustees Decision, Appeal #2014-069; 
The appeal of John Sczymecki, see board decision pages 1-6 and 13-14 
John Sczyinecki, farmer, of Topsham was found permanently disabled by 
MainePERS in 2002. In 2014, MainePERS decided Mr Sczymecki was no longer disabled 
and instead, found him capable of gainful activity Primarily based upon the report ofa 
private investigator hired by MainePERS, MainePERS contended Mr Sczymecki could geta 
_]0l) and earn his substantially gainful activity (“SGA”) amount of $41,765 32 
The John Sczyinecki Appeal Board decision in Appeal 2014-069, issued 9-8-2016, 
shows that, at least in that case, the fact that the federal ta); returns reported negative net 
income from farming triggered MainePERS to hire a private investigation firm to conduct 
video surveillance of Mr Sczyniecki purchasing groceries and perhaps putting a bridle ona 
horse with the assistance of his hired hand The hearing ofﬁcer found that it was difficult to 
discern Mr ' 
Sczymecki ’s activities from a video taken by the investigator from a nearby 
wooded area To the contrary, MainePERS staff and the MainePERS Medical Board relied 
heavily on that video in reaching their conclusion that Mr. Sczymecki was no longer 
disabled and could earn his substantially gainful activity amount of $41,765.32. As a result, 
this (d6C1S1Ol1 by the chief executive officer placed Mr Sczymecki in “Actively Seeking Work” 
status and, to continue receiving his monthly disability benefits, MainePERS required Mr 
Sczymecki to prove on a regular basis that he was _]0lI) hunting and filling out ]0l) 
applications similar to what is required under unemployment insurance 
MainePERS further decided Mr Sczymecki was capable of ]0lZ)S such as assistant 
service manager, automotive center manager, facilities manager, foreman, etc (p 5 of 
decision) “The System maintains that even if [Mr. Sczymecki] would need additional 
training to work on cars manufactured after 1980, he has transferrable skills and 
knowledge ” (p. 4)' 
1 
MainePERS requires every disabled retiree to submit an Annual Statement of 
Compensation including personal income tax returns, regardless of whether the retiree has 
“compensation from gainful occupation ” Mr. Sczyinecki was likely unaware that 
MainePERS was tracking his negative farming income as earnings or gainful activity using 
data gleaned from federal income tax returns For example, the Board’s 2014 decision 
reports Mr. Sczymecl<i ’s farming losses in 2011 -$16,023, in 2012 —‘$2o,144, and in 2013- 
$20,650 A 
(p 4) Nevertheless, in J uly 2014, MainePERS hired the private investigation firm 
Merrill's Investigations. The investigator video recorded Mr. Sczymecki with his farm hand 
on his property from a wooded area and “observed [Mr. Sczymecki] travel into the ad] acent 
town of Brunswick to purchase food items ” (p 13) 
"The Medical Board opined that based on the prior imaging studies, some functional 
limitations were warranted but that the video surveillance made clear that [Mr Sczymecki] 
May 3, 2023 BACKGROUND MATERIAL Page 20 of23
LD 1759 (13150 An Act to Clarify the DlS(Zb1lll ‘y Retirement Program of MaznePERS 
was certainly capable of greater than sedentary activity, concluding that he was at least 
capable of llight duty and more likely than not of moderate duty . The Medical Board 
concluded that the video surveillance contradicted Dr Gardiner's opinion that [Mr 
Sczymecki]'s severe back, neck, and shoulder pain limited any work capacity due to pain 
medication use" 
To the contrary, on page 13, the Hearing Officer observed, "The video surveillance 
was taken from a wooded area and it is difficult to discern Appellant's activities from it" yet 
concludes the appeal, "[Mr Sczymecki] has not met his burden to prove bya 
preponderance of the evidence that he is unable to engage in substantially gainful activity 
due to the functional limitations from the conditions of chronic pain syndrome resulting 
from chronic neck and shoulder pain and degenerative disc disease in the spine with 
secondary myofascial pain" and the Board of Trustees reaffirms —Mr Sczmecki is no longer 
eligible for disability retirement _ _ V 
The System acknowledged that Mr. Sczymecki “is not able to perform all the manual 
labor duties associated with Hideaway Farm without assistance ” yet [MainePERS] 
“maintains that [Mr. Sczymecki] is actively engaged in running the farm consistent with the 
functional limitations set forth by the Medical Board.” (p 4) In Mr Sczyinecki ’s case, the 
physical labor of the -farm was primarily done by someone else 
LD 1759 directs that statutory phrases “gainful activity ” and “gainful occupation ” 
mean work done by the retiree for pay or for the generation of profit primarily by means of 
the retiree’s own productive work activity. LD 1759 further adds statutory language tying 
medical and vocational evidence together" “The board. chief executive officer and hearing 
officers shall consider medical and vocational evidence in determining whether the 
beneficiary has the physical, mental, and vocational capabilities to perform substantially 
gainful activity”

BENEFITS WVTTHHELD PE ENTLY FQR TATE FTLTNG GT? ANNUAL STATEMENT QT‘ CUMPENSATTQN 
Case: ‘W.M. vs MainePERS 
W M —Board of Trustees Decision, Appeal #2018-004 , 
The MainePERS governing statutes require “each person who 1S the recipient ofa 
disability retirement beneﬁt to submit, each calendar year, a statement of compensation 
received from any gainful occupation during the year ” 4 MRSA §1353(5); 5 MRSA‘§17931, 
and 5 MRSA §1853 
Three months of disability beneﬁts were “withheld ” by MainePERS and never 
released to W M because he‘ was late in filing Annual Statements of Compensation He lost 
one month’s benefit in one year and two months’ beneﬁt in the second year for not 
returning his Annual Statement of Compensation and a copy of his tax return on time
W 
Arguments made on W.M.’s behalf included 
The disability that afforded him disability retirement 
beneﬁts was the result of a traumatic brain injury The nature of 
that injury has made compliance with the requirement of timely 
ﬁling of the Annual Statement of Compensation (ASC) diﬂicult 
_ 
WM is easilyforgelful and has trouble following through on 
tasks he would like to complete throughout the day 
During the period before WM was able to ﬁle the ASC he 
called MainePERS and explained that “he was getting his taxes 
done, but he cannot afford to pay the tax preparer right now” 
MainePERS staﬁ‘ “explained to him that [she could not] reinstate 
his beneﬁt until [she] received his completed ASC form and 
federal tax return.” 
The Board of Trustees decision states, “D6Splt6!I ‘€pBa’[8d warnings of the suspension 
of hislbene ﬁt, [W M ] failed to comply in 2016 and had his May 2016 benefit suspended 
The lesson from this misfortune, however, was not learned [by W M ] ” (p. 7) The 
Ma1nePERS exhibit during W.M ’s appeal was an informational packet entitled "Adult 
Guardianship Conservatorship" from the State of Maine Aging and Disability Services 
MainePERS gives notice of the consequence forfailing to file the Annual Statement 
of Compensation on time. The MainePERS 2022 Annual Statement of Compensation‘ 
mailed in January 2023 states that “if you do not return the ASC and all required 
documents by April 18th [2o23], your April payment will be your last disability benefit 
payment until your ASC is ﬁled Your monthly benefit will resume the month after you 
file. You will not receive benefits for any months during which the ASC 1S overdue ” This 
harsh consequence for the disabled retiree is not required by the governing statutes, which 
state only that “the disability retirement benefit shall be withheld until the statement [of 
May 3, 2023 BACKGROUND MATERIAL Page 22 of 23

compensation] is submitted ” 5 MRSA§17931 (2)(A); 5 MRSA §1853 (2)(A) For MainePERS 
forms, see Binder Sec. [6] MainePERS Earnings Limitations informational handout and the 
original 2022 Annual Statement of Compensation and original envelope mailed toa 
disabled retiree in January 2023 
LD 1759 does not address the Annual Statement of Compensation statute impacting 
this case However, W M ’s case provides another example of the system construing the 
statutes in a manner to deny beneﬁts even though the statute doesn’t require that result 
Additionally, appeals of MainePERS ’s staff decisions no longer get a hearing before 
the Board of Trustees. 5 MRSA §171o5—A requires that there be an opportunity for an 
informal hearing of the staff decision 
“Prior to any adverse decision rendered by retirement system staff 
with respect to the recoupment, suspension or termination of 
benefits, or assessment of penalties or interest, the affected member 
or retiree is entitled to an informal hearing to which the‘ member or 
retiree may bring legal counsel The retirement system shall issuea 
written decision, this decision issubject to the retirement system’s 
review and appeal process pursuant to section 17451.” 
There has been no rule promulgated about the informal hearing process It is unclear 
whether such an opportunity for an informal hearing is actually provided in all cases In the 
LD 1759 Background Materials binder and digital files, see unpublished internal 
MainePERS policy, “Departmental Policy- Service Programs, 1 2 — Beneﬁt Suspension. ” 
Such an opportunity informal hearing does not appear to be provided by MainePERS 
in cases in which MaiiiePERS suspends payment of disability beneﬁts for every month that 
the disability recipient is late in filing the Annual Statement of Compensation (ASC) Even 
after the disability retirement recipient files a late ASC,'based on prior Board decisions, it 
appears that MainePERS ’s policy is to not pay the suspended benefits -— even though the 
governing statutes state “the disability retirement benefit shall be withheld until the 
statement [of compensation] is submitted. ” 5 MRSA §17931(2)(A), 5 MRSA §1853 (2)(A) 
An opportunity for a formal appeal process before a hearing officer is provided for in 
statute. 5 MRSA §17451 The Board of Trustees then generally adopts the hearing officer’s 
written decision without any board discussion 
The Board decision in W M (and many other Board decisions)/ C1’[€S case law and 
states “An administrative agency’ s construction of a statute administered by it is entitled to 
great deference and will be upheld unless the statute plainly compels a contrary result.”

Frequent mental distress, deﬁned as 14 or more self-reported 
mentally unhealthy days in the past 50 days,* is associated with 
adverse health behaviors, increased use of health services, mental 
disorders (e g , diagnosis of major depressive disorder), chronic 
diseases, and functional limitations (1) Adults with disabilities 
more often report depression and anxiety (2), reduced health 
care access (3), and health—related risk behaviors than do 
adults without disabilities CDC analyzed 2018 Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to compare 
the prevalence of frequent mental distress among adults with 
disabilities with that among adults without disabilities and to 
identify factors associated with mental distress among those with 
disabilities Nationwide, an estimated 17 4 million adults with 
disabilities reported frequent mental distress, the prevalence of 
reported mental distress among those with disabilities (32 9%) 
was 4 6 times that of those without disabilities (7 2%) Among 
adults with disabilities, those with both cognitive and mobility 
disabilities most frequently reported mental distress (55 6%) 
Adults with disabilities who reported adverse health—related 
characteristics (e g , cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, 
insufficient sleep, obesity, or depressive disorders) or an unmet 
health care need because of cost also reported experiencing 
more mental distress than did those with disabilities who did 
not have these characteristics Adults living below the federal 
poverty level reported mental distress 70% more often than did 
adults in higher income households Among states, age-adjusted 
prevalence of mental distress among adults with disabilities 
ranged from 25 2% (Alaska) to 42 9°/0 (New Hampshire) 
Understanding the prevalence of mental distress among adults 
with disabilities could help health care providers, public health 
professionals, and policy makers target interventions and inform 
programs and policies to ensure receipt of mental health screen- 
ing, care, and support services to reduce mental distress among 
adults with disabilities

income households compared with males and those who were 
married, employed, identiﬁed as straight or not gay, and lived 
in higher-income households Persons identifying as non- 
Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, and middle—aged or older reported 
mental distress less often than did those who identiﬁed as non- 
Hispanic white, and who were younger Among adults without 
disabilities, both veterans and retirees were 20% less likely to 
report mental distress than were nonveterans and adults who 
were employed, no differences were found by veteran and 
employment status for adults with disabilities 
Among adults with disabilities, those who reported adverse 
health-related behaviors or conditions (1 e , cigarette smoking, 
insufficient sleep, physical inactivity, obesity, and diagnosed 
depressive disorder) or an unmet health care need because of 
cost more often had frequent mental distress than did those 
without these characteristics (Table 2) In general, patterns 
were similar across disability types All health-related fac- 
tors were associated with mental distress for adults without 
disabilities (Supplementary Table 1, https //stacks cdc govl 
view/cdc/92748) Among adults with disabilities, the highest 
prevalences of frequent mental distress were in New Hampshire, 
(42 9%), South Carolina (39 2%), and Maine (38 7%), the 
median prevalence (32 5%) was in Louisiana, and the lowest 
prevalences were in Alaska (25 2%), Hawaii (26 7%), and 
Illinois (26 9%) (Figure) (SupplementaryTable 2, https //stacks 
cdc gov/view/cdc/92748) Adults with disabilities in Minnesota, 
Kansas, Georgia, Iowa, and Delaware were 5 4—5 7 times more 
likely to report frequent mental distress than were adults with- 
out disabilities, Whereas in Illinois and West Virginia, the PRs 
were 3 5 and 3 6, respectively (Figure) (SupplementaryTable 2, 
https //stacks cdc gov/view/cdc/92748) 
Discussion 
In 2018, an estimated 17 4 million U S adults with dis- 
abilities reported frequent mental distress across a range of 
demographic characteristics (including poverty and marital 
status), 4 6 times as often than did adults without disabilities 
Having a diagnosed depressive disorder was associated with 
experiencing frequent mental distress, with approximately 
one half of adults with disabilities and a diagnosed depressive 
disorder reporting distress One in six adults with disabilities 
who did not have a diagnosed depressive disorder reported 
frequent mental distress, possibly representing adults with 
undiagnosed mental disorders Health care providers caring for 
adults with disabilities might focus on the primary disability 
but miss opportunities to identify and treat co-occurring men- 
tal health conditions (5) Furthermore, symptoms associated 
with some physical disabilities and chronic conditions, as well 
as overall level of functional impairment, might be exacerbated

demographic and health-related risk factors associated with 
mental and physical health Public health professionals, policy 
makers, and health care providers can consider recommending 
strategies that increase social cohesion, encourage community 
participation, and improve access to quality mental health 
screening and care, as well as promoting healthy lifestyle 
recommendations and inclusion in evidence-based programs 
to address disparities in mental distress Increasing provider 
awareness of the importance of mental health screening could help improve identification and treatment of co-occurring 
mental health conditions, especially among adults with cogni- 
tive and mobility disabilities who are approximately nine times 
as likely to have frequent mental distress as are adults without 
disabilities Future work to better understand mental distress 
among adults with disabilities could help target interventions, 
whether as stand-alone approaches or components of existing 
disease prevention and health promotion strategies
