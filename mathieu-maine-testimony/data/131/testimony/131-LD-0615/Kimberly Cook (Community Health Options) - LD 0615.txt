Testimony in opposition to 
LD 615, An Act to Ensure Access to Newly Born Male Infant Circumcision by Requiring MaineCare 
and Health Insurance Coverage 
Kimberly Cook, Esq. 
March 23, 2023 
As Maine's only nonprofit CO-OP health insurance company, we are focused on providing affordable, 
high quality benefits that promote health and wellbeing. ln order to keep the cost of health coverage 
affordable, it is critical that health coverage is focused on health care services that are deemed 
medically necessary for preventative, diagnostic or treatment care. 
LD 615 would require carriers to provide coverage of a service that is not medically necessary asa 
routine procedure. While we are supportive of our Members choosing medical procedures that work 
best for their family, we are opposed to state mandated coverage of services that are not medically 
necessaw. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary increases in the cost of coverage, we do not 
support legislation that requires coverage for services that are not medically necessary. 
We understand there may be instances in which there is a medical need for circumcision. We encourage 
this Committee to consider amending the bill to require coverage for circumcision of a newly born male 
only when medically necessary. If the Committee is inclined to pursue this mandate, we would ask that 
you send it for a mandate study with the Bureau of Insurance so the costs of this new mandate can be 
calculated and considered in your final decision. 
We appreciate the Committee's consideration of our comments.
