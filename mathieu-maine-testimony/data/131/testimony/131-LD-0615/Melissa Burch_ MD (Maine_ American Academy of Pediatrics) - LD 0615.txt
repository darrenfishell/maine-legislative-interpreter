Testimony in support of LD 615 , An Act to Ensure Access to Newly Born Male 
Infant Circumcision by Requiring MaineCare and Health Insurance 
Coverage.    
 
Good afternoon, Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and the distinguished 
members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee .  
My name is Melissa Burch, MD , FAAP and I  am a pe diatrician in the Bangor 
area and a board member of the Maine  Chapter of the American Academy o f 
Pedia trics.  
 One of my roles as a community pediatrician in Maine is to examine newborns on the first day of life and meet with their families , often tired and 
overwhelmed from the bringing a child into the world. When th is newborn  
baby is a boy, parents usually bring up circumcision. This  common procedure is 
supported by the American Acade my of Pediatrics.  
 Families almost always have very strong personal and cultural expectation  
about this procedure. About 70 % of the  fathers in Maine are themselves 
circumcised. When the father is circumcised, nine out of ten of those families  
request the procedure for their baby boy.   
 When parents do request circumcision, I have to explain that it will only be available for them if they  have private insurance. Since 2004, Mainecare has 
denied coverage for newborn male circumcision.  This has created a two -tier 
system where some fa milies are able to get the procedure and others leave  
the hospital without it. Yet 60 -70% of families with infant boys request it.  
 Do we want insurance making this decision for Maine families? Is i t equitable 
for some f amilies to have this option and others be denied?  I ask you to PASS 
LD 615 to allow  fairness  and equity  to all Maine familie s.  Thank yo u.
