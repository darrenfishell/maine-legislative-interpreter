Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial 
Services Committee, below, please find citations for the research mentioned in my testimony that 
supports the validity of coverage for newborn male circumcision. As you will see below, the evidence 
suggests that newborn male circumcision is a preventive measure that can lower the prevalence of 
infections and other medical diagnoses. 
Thank you, and I am happy to answer questions.  Sarah or I will be available at the work session, as well.

Circumcision and lifetime risk of urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Brian J Morris 1, Thomas E Wiswell
Abstract
Purpose: Urinary tract infection is common in infant males who are uncircumcised and can lead to renal 
parenchymal disease of the still growing pediatric kidney. Although the rate of urinary tract infection is 
highest in the first year of life, the cumulative incidence during the rest of the lifetime is under-
recognized, but is expected to be nontrivial. Thus, any intervention that might prevent urinary tract 
infection would be expected to reduce suffering and medical costs.
Materials and methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies examining the single risk factor of 
lack of circumcision, then determined the prevalence and relative risk of urinary tract infection in 
different age groups (0 to 1, 1 to 16 and older than 16 years). From these data we estimated the lifetime 
prevalence.
Results: For age 0 to 1 year the relative risk was 9.91 (95% CI 7.49-13.1), for age 1 to 16 years RR was 
6.56 (95% CI 3.26-13.2) and for older than 16 years it was 3.41-fold (95% CI 0.916-12.7) higher in 
uncircumcised males. We then calculated that 32.1% (95% CI 15.6-49.8) of uncircumcised males 
experience a urinary tract infection in their lifetime compared with 8.8% (95% CI 4.15-13.2) of 
circumcised males (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.15-11.8). The number needed to treat was 4.29 (95% CI 2.20-27.2).
Conclusions: The single risk factor of lack of circumcision confers a 23.3% chance of urinary tract 
infection during the lifetime. This greatly exceeds the prevalence of circumcision complications (1.5%), 
which are mostly minor. The potential seriousness of urinary tract infection supports circumcision as a 
desirable preventive health intervention in infant males.

Canadian Pediatrics Society position statement on newborn circumcision: a risk-benefit analysis revisited
Brian J Morris 1, Jeffrey D Klausner, John N Krieger, Bradley J Willcox, Pierre D Crouse, Neil Pollock
Abstract
Introduction: The Canadian Pediatrics Society (CPS) recently released a position statement on early 
infant (newborn) male circumcision (EIMC). It concluded that since benefits do not exceed risks, 
circumcision should only be performed on boys in high-risk populations or circumstances. This 
contradicts recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) whose policies each support more widespread implementation of EIMC. 
Here we review the CPS statement, particularly its risk-benefit analysis, to determine the basis for this 
disparity.
Materials and methods: We performed a risk-benefit analysis based on relevant literature retrieved 
from PubMed reporting frequency of each condition, giving emphasis to data from meta-analyses and 
randomized controlled trials.
Results: Although the CPS recognized some of the benefits of EIMC, its inclusion of weak studies of 
adverse events led to these being over-estimated, greatly exceeding the figure of < 0.5% found in a 
recent large, technically robust, CDC study. The CPS under-estimated benefits by omitting balanitis, 
balanoposthitis, prostate cancer, some sexually transmitted infections and candidiasis, and failing to 
consider lifetime prevalence of urinary tract infections in uncircumcised males. In contrast, our more 
inclusive risk-benefit analysis found benefits exceed risks by approximately 100 to 1 and that lack of 
EIMC contributes to adverse medical conditions, some potentially fatal, in approximately half of 
uncircumcised males.
Conclusions: The 2015 CPS position statement on EIMC is at odds with the evidence. The CPS 
conclusions stem from errors in its risk-benefit analysis. In light of our findings we recommend the CPS 
issue a revised statement.

Neonatal Circumcision and Urinary Tract Infections in Infants With Hydronephrosis
Jonathan S Ellison 1, Geolani W Dy 2, Benjamin C Fu 3, Sarah K Holt 2, John L Gore 3, Paul A Merguerian 
Abstract
Background: Boys with urinary tract abnormalities may derive a greater benefit from newborn 
circumcision for prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) than the general population. However, the 
effect of newborn circumcision on UTI is not well characterized across the etiological spectrum of 
hydronephrosis. We hypothesized that boys with an early diagnosis of hydronephrosis who undergo 
newborn circumcision will have reduced rates of UTI.
Methods: The MarketScan data set, an employer-based claims database, was used to identify boys with 
hydronephrosis or hydronephrosis-related diagnoses within the first 30 days of life. The primary 
outcome was the rate of UTIs within the first year of life, comparing circumcised boys with 
uncircumcised boys and adjusting for region, insurance type, year of birth, and infant comorbidity.
Results: A total of 5561 boys met inclusion criteria, including 2386 (42.9%) undergoing newborn 
circumcision and 3175 (57.1%) uncircumcised boys. On multivariate analysis, circumcision was 
associated with a decreased risk of UTI in both boys with hydronephrosis and healthy cohorts: odds ratio 
(OR) 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.44) and OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.21-0.48), respectively. To 
prevent 1 UTI, 10 patients with hydronephrosis would have to undergo circumcision compared with 83 
healthy boys. Among specific hydronephrosis diagnoses, circumcision was associated with a reduced risk 
of UTI for those with isolated hydronephrosis (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.26-0.46]), vesicoureteral reflux (OR 
0.35 [95% CI 0.23-0.54]), and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.20-0.61]).
Conclusions: Newborn circumcision is associated with a significantly lower rate of UTI among infant boys 
with hydronephrosis.

Circumcision rates in the United States: rising or falling? What effect might the new affirmative pediatric 
policy statement have?
Brian J Morris 1, Stefan A Bailis 2, Thomas E Wiswell 3
Abstract
The objective of this review was to assess the trend in the US male circumcision rate and the impact that 
the affirmative 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement might have on neonatal 
circumcision practice. We searched PubMed for the term circumcision to retrieve relevant articles. This 
review was prompted by a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found a 
slight increase, from 79% to 81%, in the prevalence of circumcision in males aged 14 to 59 years during 
the past decade. There were racial and ethnic disparities, with prevalence rising to 91% in white, 76% in 
black, and 44% in Hispanic males. Because data on neonatal circumcision are equivocal, we undertook a 
critical analysis of hospital discharge data. After correction for underreporting, we found that the 
percentage had declined from 83% in the 1960s to 77% by 2010. A risk-benefit analysis of conditions 
that neonatal circumcision protects against revealed that benefits exceed risks by at least 100 to 1 and 
that over their lifetime, half of uncircumcised males will require treatment for a medical condition 
associated with retention of the foreskin. Other analyses show that neonatal male circumcision is cost-
effective for disease prevention. The benefits of circumcision begin in the neonatal period by protection 
against infections that can damage the pediatric kidney. Given the substantial risk of adverse conditions 
and disease, some argue that failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his 
right to good health. There is no long-term adverse effect of neonatal circumcision on sexual function or 
pleasure. The affirmative 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics policy supports parental education 
about, access to, and insurance and Medicaid coverage for elective infant circumcision. As with 
vaccination, circumcision of newborn boys should be part of public health policies. Campaigns should 
prioritize population subgroups with lower circumcision prevalence and a higher burden of diseases that 
can be ameliorated by circumcision.
