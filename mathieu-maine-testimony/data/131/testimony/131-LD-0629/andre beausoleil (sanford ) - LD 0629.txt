Ld 541
Parity in taxation for medication.
I would like to support this bill as it makes 
common sense why it should not be passed.
A medicine is a medicine  as it is often said that 
government is running behind what is going on 
in the world. This is your opportunity  for Maine 
to correct a wrong.
Finally I would go further and exempt over the 
counter medication as an example aspirin back 
pain medication and others  Just because there 
is no prescription attached to the purchase of 
these  doctors often tell their patients to 
purchase them
Thank you  andre a beausoleil  sanford
