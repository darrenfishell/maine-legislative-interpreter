Subject: Testimony for LD629 
This mcssa - 
e originates from outside the Maine Lcislature. 
I'm unable to submit written testimony to the Taxation committee regarding LD 629. The hearing is today, 
March 9 at 2pm. I tried to submit via the Maine.gov site and it erased my testimony and wouldn't complete the 
process. I'll paste it below and hope that you Will send it to the Taxation committee members. Thank you. 
Committee members, I ask that you support LD 629. There are many reasons to support this with the numberl 
reason being that Taxation is theft and you have absolutely no business collecting a single cent, you already get 
too much. As it is,we're over taxed. And, in this great economy, we need every cent. Our Second Amendment is 
clear- shall not be infringed. Taxes on a RIGHT help keep that RIGHT from being exercised; they're an 
infringement. Firearms, their accessories and ammunition are expensive. There is absolutely no reason the 
government deserves a single cent from a ﬁrearm purchase, absolutely no reason they should get a piece from 
an ammunition purchase. You werent there, why should you get a cut? What did you do to earn a percent of 
each dollar spent on a ﬁrearm?You charge enough fees via tax stamps, ridiculous licensing, various application 
costs etc. You get enough. You don't need a tax, too. It's pure greed to tax every dollar earned, every dollar 
spent, every dollar won, every dollar inherited. We shouldn't have to pay tax on ﬁrearm and ammunition 
purchases, as well. You get enough. Do the right thing and support LD 629.
