LD 629
Taxation Committee members, I ask that you support LD629.  The second 
amendment gives us the right to protect ourselves and increasing costs should not get 
in the way.  Allowing the taxation of firearms and ammunition give the government a 
way to "price out" citizens from a right guaranteed to them by the Constitution.  This 
legislation is a way to prevent that from happening.
