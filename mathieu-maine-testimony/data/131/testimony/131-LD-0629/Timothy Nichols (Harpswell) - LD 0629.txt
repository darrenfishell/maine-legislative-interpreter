LD 629
Taxation Committee members, I ask that you support LD629 “An Act to Improve, 
Protect and Defend the Individual Civil Right to Bear Arms Through Exemption of 
Firearms and Ammunition from Taxation.”
It is my belief that taxation can and will be used as a tool to limit our 2nd Amendment rights.
