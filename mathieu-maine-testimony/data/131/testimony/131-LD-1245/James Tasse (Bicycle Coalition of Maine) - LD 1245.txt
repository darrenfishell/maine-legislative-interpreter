Greetings
Chairs
Chipman
and
W illiams
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
T ransportation:
My
name
is
James
T assé
and
I
am
the
Assistant
Director
of
the
Bicycle
Coalition
of
Maine
(BCM).
Our
mission
is
to
make
Maine
better
and
safer
for
bicycling
and
walking.
On
behalf
of
our
more
than
20,000
members
and
supporters,
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
in
OPPOSITION
to
LD
1245.
The
BCM
believes
that
this
bill
will
not
solve
perceived
issues
with
“motorized
bicycles”
and
will
create
expensive
and
burdensome
complications
for
the
Bureau
of
Motor
V ehicles.
For
these
reasons,
the
BCM
ur ges
an
“Ought
Not
to
Pass”
report
from
the
committee.
Of
particular
concern
to
the
Coalition
is
the
fact
that
the
sponsor
apparently
intends
for
this
legislation
to
apply
to
low
speed
electric
assist
bicycles,
although
it
would
not
as
written,
because
the
definition
of
“motorized
bicycles”
under
Maine
law
explicitly
does
not
include
e-bikes.
E-bikes
are
already
well-regulated
under
T itle
29-A
Chapter
19
§2063,
and
adding
a
requirement
to
register
devices
that
typically
operate
at
less
than
28mph
is
unnecessary
and
would
prove
burdensome
to
owners
and
state
of fices
alike.
E-bikes
operate
at
“human
scale”
speeds,
are
silent,
and
are
zero
emissions.
The
BCM
is
working
with
both
the
MaineDOT
and
the
Ef ficiency
Maine
T rust
to
launch
test
ride
and
rebate
programs
that
seek
to
encourage
people
to
adopt
e-bikes.
LD
1245’ s
burdensome
requirements
would
be
at
cross
purposes
to
the
work
of
these
other
state
entities.
In
testimony
from
Deputy
Director
Catherine
Curtis
of
the
Maine
Bureau
of
Motor
V ehicles,
the
committee
heard
of
the
burdens
this
legislation
would
place
upon
the
Bureau,
as
well
as
the
“significant
fiscal
note”
that
would
be
necessary
to
implement
it.
W e
agree
with
that
assessment.
An
additional
concern
is
the
impact
this
bill
would
have
on
law
enforcement
departments,
which
would
be
expected
to
enforce
this
policy
if
it
became
law .
W e
submit
that
there
are
many
more
important
things
Maine’ s
law
enforcement
professionals
could
be
doing
than
pulling
over
a
60
year
old
woman
riding
an
unregistered
Class
1
e-bike.

Maine,
like
most
states,
treat
e-bikes
as
bicycles,
because
they
are
devices
that
operate
at
“human-scale”
speeds
and
have
significant
benefits
for
roadway
safety ,
low-income
mobility ,
and
health.
Any
local
concerns
about
the
operation
of
e-bikes,
or
even
“motorized
bicycles,”
are
best
managed
by
local
policy
actions
that
are
tar geted
at
specific,
documentable,
issues.
Creating
more
government
bureaucracy
and
pointless
regulation
at
the
state
level
will
not
solve
any
perceived
local
problems
concerning
these
devices.
LD
1245
is
poorly
conceived,
poorly
written,
and
burdensome
to
state
government
and
citizens
alike.
It
should
receive
an
Ought
Not
T o
Pass
report
from
this
committee.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
and
for
your
service
to
the
state.

Testimony in Opposition to LD 1245 
An Act to Require Registration of Motorized Bicycles or Tricycles or Motorized 
Scooters
Greetings Chairs Chipman and Williams and the distinguished members of the 
Committee on Transportation: 
My name is James Tassé and I am the Assistant Director of the Bicycle Coalition of 
Maine (BCM).  Our mission is to make Maine better and safer for bicycling and 
walking.  On behalf of our more than 20,000 members and supporters, I am 
submitting this testimony in OPPOSITION to LD 1245. The BCM believes that this 
bill will not solve perceived issues with “motorized bicycles” and will create 
expensive and burdensome complications for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. For these
reasons, the BCM urges an “Ought Not to Pass” report from the committee.
Of particular concern to the Coalition is the fact that the sponsor apparently intends 
for this legislation to apply to low speed electric assist bicycles, although it would not 
as written, because the definition of “motorized bicycles” under Maine law explicitly 
does not include e-bikes. 
E-bikes are already well-regulated under Title 29-A Chapter 19 §2063, and adding a 
requirement to register devices that typically operate at less than 28mph is 
unnecessary and would prove burdensome to owners and state offices alike. E-bikes 
operate at “human scale” speeds, are silent, and are zero emissions. The BCM is 
working with both the MaineDOT and the Efficiency Maine Trust to launch test ride 
and rebate programs that seek to encourage people to adopt e-bikes.  LD 1245’s 
burdensome requirements would be at cross purposes to the work of these other state 
entities.  
In testimony from Deputy Director Catherine Curtis of the Maine Bureau of Motor 
Vehicles, the committee heard of the burdens this legislation would place upon the 
Bureau, as well as the “significant fiscal note” that would be necessary to implement 
it. We agree with that assessment. 
An additional concern is the impact this bill would have on law enforcement 
departments, which would be expected to enforce this policy if it became law. We 
submit that there are many more important things Maine’s law enforcement 
professionals could be doing than pulling over a 60 year old woman riding an 
unregistered Class 1 e-bike. 
Maine, like most states, treat e-bikes as bicycles, because they are devices that operate
at “human-scale” speeds and have significant benefits for roadway safety, low-income
mobility, and health. 
Any local concerns about the operation of e-bikes, or even “motorized bicycles,” are 
best managed by local policy actions that are targeted at specific, documentable, 
issues. Creating more government bureaucracy and pointless regulation at the state 
level will not solve any perceived local problems concerning these devices. 
LD 1245 is poorly conceived, poorly written, and burdensome to state government 
and citizens alike. It should receive an Ought Not To Pass report from this committee.
Thank you for your time, and for your service to the state.
