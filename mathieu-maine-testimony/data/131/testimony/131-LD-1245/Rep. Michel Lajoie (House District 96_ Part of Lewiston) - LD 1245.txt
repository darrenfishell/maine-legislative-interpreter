Befor e
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
T ransportation
Good
morning
Senator
Chipman,
Representative
W illiams
and
honorable
members
of
the
T ransportation
Committee.
My
name
is
Michel
Lajoie,
and
I
represent
House
District
96,
which
includes
a
portion
of
Lewiston.
I
am
here
to
introduce
LD
1245,
An
Act
to
Requir e
Registration
of
Motorized
Bicycles
or
T ricycles
or
Motorized
Scooters
.
The
idea
for
this
bill
was
brought
to
my
attention
by
a
constituent
who
has
witnessed
the
dangers
that
can
arise
between
cyclists
and
drivers
who
may
not
be
following
the
rules
of
the
road.
As
a
way
of
keeping
cyclists
and
drivers
safe,
this
bill
requires
motorized
bicycles,
tricycles
and
motorized
scooters
to
be
registered
to
operate
on
a
public
way .
While
Maine
has
laws
in
place
that
those
who
use
bicycles,
roller
skis,
toy
vehicles
and
scooters
must
abide
by ,
there
is
currently
no
requirement
that
motorized
bicycles,
tricycles
and
motorized
scooters
be
registered.
According
to
a
report
by
the
National
Bicycle
Dealers
Association,
electric
bike
sales
in
the
United
States
in
2022
surpassed
$1.3
billion,
marking
a
33%
increase
from
the
previous
year .
The
e-bicycle
market
in
the
United
States
is
expected
to
reach
$1.6
billion
this
year .
As
the
cost
of
living
continues
to
increase
and
more
of
our
community
members
search
for
cost-ef fective,
climate-conscious
transportation
solutions,
we
can
expect
to
see
this
sector
grow .
While
LD
1245
calls
for
registration,
a
motorized
bicycle,
tricycle
or
motorized
scooter
would
not
be
subject
to
Maine’ s
vehicle
inspection
requirements,
except
that
the
Chief
of
the
State
Police
may
provide
certain
inspection
requirements
be
met.
The
money
generated
from
registration
could
be
used
to
help
pay
for
Maine’ s
road
repairs.
Finally ,
I
suggest
that
the
committee
consider
including
electronic
skateboards
as
well.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
I
am
happy
to
bring
forth
any
information
that
may
be
helpful
to
you
in
your
upcoming
work
session.
