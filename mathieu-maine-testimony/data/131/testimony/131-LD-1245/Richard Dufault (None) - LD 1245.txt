Testimony in Support of LD 1245' 
An Act to Require Registration of Motorized-Bicycles or T ricycles or Motorized Scooters 
Good afternoon Senator Chipman, Representative Williams and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Transportation. My name is Richard Dufault, and I am a resident of 
Lewiston. I am testifying today in support of LD 1245, An Act to Require Registration of 
Motorized Bicycles or Tricycles or Motorized Scooters. 
Mostly all motorized vehicles are required to register and pay excise tax. 
Motorized bicycles or tricycles or scooters should not be exempt from state registration and 
should pay their fair share.- 
As they share the use of a public way, these vehicles should be required to register, in order to 
assist municipalities and the state in road upkeep costs. A
