LD 1845
Thank you, Representative Osher for sponsoring LD 1845.  I was born in Greenville 
in 1943 and left for college in 1962, returning for summers until 2000 when I retired 
and now live in Greenville full time.  During these many years, I have enjoyed the 
number of planets and stars that are visible because of the darkness.  As time has 
passed, more and more lighting has come to our region which interfere with seeing 
the stars and planets as I did when a young person.
I feel certain that Dark Sky is a relatively new concept in our area and am confident 
that businesses, land owners, and our municipality will embrace guidelines to keep 
our skies dark.  Greenville has already installed Dark Sky friendly streetlights and is 
replacing older lights with Dark Sky friendly ones.
Thank you for this opportunity to speak in favor of LD 1845.
