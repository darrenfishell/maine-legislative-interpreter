There are so many reasons I'd like to defend the dark skies in Maine. For one, I 
appreciate the beauty of the stars and very much wish to keep this as part of my 
experience being a resident here. I moved to Maine in 2019 in part due to having 
access to the beauty, quiet, and splendor of a multitude of stars at night. More 
importantly, though, I see night sky pollution as a health issue. Too much light, or the 
wrong kinds of light, has a negative effect on birds, bats, and insects, in addition to 
other creatures. We are losing so many species of birds each year due to the disruptive
nature of light pollution, and we have already plagued insects with many other 
challenges (such as environmental toxins). This affects humans in terms of food 
supply due to the struggles of pollinators to do their work. There are other impacts on 
humans related to hormonal cancers now linked to sleep issues. We must get ahead of
this issue. It's a problem we can solve easily--and one that will save money and save 
our lives. Why would we ever choose to do otherwise?
