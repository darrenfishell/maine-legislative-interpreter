RE: AGC Maine’s Comments on  1845  “An Act to Regulate Outdoor Lighting ” 
 
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich , and Distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Environment and Natural Resources  my name  is Matt  Marks,  I am a Principal and Cornerstone  
Government  Affairs  and sendin g this letter  on behalf  of my client  AGC  Maine.   
 
AGC  Maine  is a statewide  commercial construction  industry  association  representing contractors,  
suppliers,  and service  providers.  The association  consists of companies’  signatory  to union s, open  shops , 
ESOPs,  and small businesses.   
 
AGC  Maine  recommends  the decision  for lighting  policies  are left for municipalities  to consider.  Local  
government  can determine  what  areas  could  benefit  from  additional  lighting  for safety  or security  
reasons.  Many  areas  have  already  adopted  policies  including the following:

While it appears,  some exceptions are added to the bill, there could be other facilities associated with 
night operations that should be considered including hospitals, education facilities, public safety, parking 
lots, manufacturing that should be provided an easy process to be considered exempt. That’s why we 
consider this issue better managed by munic ipalities.  
 
I appreciate the opportunity to offer our opinion, and we are happy to answer any questions.  
 
Thank you,
