TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1845  
 
AN ACT TO REGULATE OUTDOOR LIGHTING  
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich  and members of the Environment and Natural Resources  
Committee.  I am Steven Bailey , executive director of Maine School Management Asso ciation, testifying on 
behalf of the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School 
Superintendents Association , in opposition to  L.D. 1845 . 
 
MSSA/MSBA are both opposed to L .D. 1845. While the exact application to schools an d school grounds is 
not exactly clear, it is  anticipate d that L .D. 1845 would  impac t lighting used for parking, school building 
illumination, sidewalks, and potentially lights used for evening athletic event s. Cost of replacement lighting, 
or shields that would need to be in place if  lightin g were to remain on throughout the  night, is of great concern 
to the schools and their budgets â€“ ultimately wit h the impact on the local taxpayer . 
 
Additionally,  towns have ordina nces that oversee outdoor  lightin g and the se decisions should remain loca l. 
 
While  a good ide a for the environment,  perhaps a longer phase in period could be  establishe d so that as 
replacements are put in place the new requirements can be me t. Additiona lly, if this bill can be tied to an 
Efficienc y Maine rebate program  perhaps a quicker implementation could be seen.  
 
As presented, MSSA and MSBA urge an ONTP vote by the Committee on Environment and Natural 
Resources .
