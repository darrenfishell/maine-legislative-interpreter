Dear Members of the Committee for Environment and Natural Resources,
Thank you for wanting to hear our views on this important piece of legislation.  
We have an amazing resource in our state; the ability to see the night sky in most 
places in the state without the occlusion of big lights and the incumbent light 
pollution.  The night sky keeps us in touch with the greater mysteries of being alive.  
We need it, yearn for it and so must protect it!
I came to Maine 43 years ago on May Day. Fresh out of college and looking to be in a
more natural world away from many of the unsustainable practices humankind 
practiced all around us.  Maine is a haven to me and my heart’s home.
I worry that as people continue to move into the my town, they set up big lights and 
cut down trees.  We don’t usually know better until we lose the things we love.  Let 
us help ourselves by enacting this law.
Let us limit the amount of light in the sky by using a limit of 2700 Kelvin, having 
cut-off shields to keep the light on the intended subject, the ground!
respectfully,
gabrielle wellman
