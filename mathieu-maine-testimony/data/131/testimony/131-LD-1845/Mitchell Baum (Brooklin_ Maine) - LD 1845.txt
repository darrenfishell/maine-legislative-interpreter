Dear Committee Members,
Thank you for your work. My name is Mitchell Baum. I live year round in Brooklin, 
Maine. I am strongly for this legislation for many reasons. For the sake of brevity, and
to hopefully not repeat what others will say, here are two relevant memories:
As a child, I saw Luna Moths 3 or 4 times. Each was an occasion of wonder and awe. 
Luna Moths are big, 4 inches across, with swallow tails, and pale green. Each time 
was a trill that something this beautiful and improbable existed. As an adult, sadly the 
only Luna Moths I've seen have been dead at night on the pavement at closed gas 
stations, attracted by the all night lights.
Some years back I had diner with friends who had rented a house at the Look Out in 
Brooklin. When it was time for me to leave, the couple and their two children walked 
me to my car. There was no moon. The clear sky was ablaze with stars. We were all 
deeply affected. The youngest, barely awake in his fathers arms, became fully 
attentive and excited.  He traced his finger across the sky. He'd never seen anything 
like it. Years later, we still talked about that night. Without the proposed legislation, I 
fear such experiences, and the knowledge that Luna Moths, skies ablaze with stars 
exist, will be forgotten.
