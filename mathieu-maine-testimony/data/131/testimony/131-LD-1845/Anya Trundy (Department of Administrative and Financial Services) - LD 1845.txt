Testimony of Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic Operations 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services 
Neither for Nor Against 
LD 1845, An Act To Regulate Outdoor Lighting 
Sponsored by Rep. Osher 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources, l am Anya Trundy, Chief of Legislative and Strategic 
Operations for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. I am providing 
testimony Neither for Nor Against LD 1845 as it applies to the State of Maine as an entity. 
DAFS’ Bureau of General Sen/ices has already adopted the illuminance recommendations of 
the Illuminating Engineering Society; however, for leased space they are being integrated as 
leases come up for renewal or expire and are replaced. The State of Maine has over 200 
leased spaces and it is not uncommon for the terms of our leases to be 10-15 years, so this is 
an objective that we are accomplishing over a matter of years. This long-term approach to 
implementation eliminates the cost of requiring these improvements as of a date certain and 
requiring the State to renegotiate a large number of leases ahead of their time. 
The Bureau of General Services also identified as a concern that at times, particularly during 
construction and renovations, temporary lighting is needed. We wouldn’t want to have to reject 
a temporary solution to provide safe lighting because it doesn‘t meet the bill’s requirement. We 
suggest that a reasonable exception should be created for these situations. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify, l would be happy to answer any questions.
