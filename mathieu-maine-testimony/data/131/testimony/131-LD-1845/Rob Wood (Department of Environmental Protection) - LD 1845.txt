bers of the Committee, I am Rob Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and mem 
Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources at the Department of Environmental 
Protection, speaking in opposition to L.D. 1845. 
This Department is opposed to L.D. 1845 because it would require substantial staff 
capacity for enforcement and compliance activities that we do not currently have. Under 
the provisions of the bill, any person could file a complaint that their neighbor has

L.D. 1845: An Act to Regulate Outdoor Lighting 
Testimony of: Rob Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources, DEP 
Public Hearing: May 8, 2023

installed a noncompiiant lighting fixture, or illuminated a noncompiiant lighting fixture at 
night, in a municipality that has not adopted an ordinance meeting the standards 
proposed in the bill, and the Department would be obligated to investigate that 
complaint and to carry out enforcement actions if warranted. We estimate this would 
require 2-3 additional staff members in each regional office, for a total of 8-12 additional 
staff statewide. 
The Department would like to emphasize that we are not opposed to dark skies. ln 
preparing for this hearing, we had many conversations among staff members who find 
great enjoyment in being under dark skies and have a profound appreciation for them 
and the fact that we can view them in many parts of Maine. However, put simply, L.D. 
1845 is not workable for the DEP without a large fiscal note and allocation of additional 
staff positions. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. l am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
