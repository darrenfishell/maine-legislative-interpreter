Testimony Neither for Nor Against to LD 1845 
An Act to Regulate Outdoor Lighting  
May 8, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the committee, my name is James Cote and I am 
submitting this testimony on behalf of Versant Power neither for nor against LD 1845.  
 
We were only recently made aware of this legislation, but wanted to point out that as written, LD 1845 could have 
a fairly significant operational impact on utility pole owners, and ultimately a cost impact on utility customers, 
where those utility poles also have lighting attached on them.  
 
Versant Power currently utilizes dark sky lighting in some, but not all, lighting applications. While we are happy 
to consider ways to advance this interest, we want to be clear that making the transition to this type of lighting in 
all applications would take time and cost money- a cost that will ultimately be borne by electric customers. 
Understanding that we are in a time period where high electric costs are of significant concern to all of us, we 
would urge the committee to consider the potential cost impacts to electric customers. One way to avoid any 
impact to electric or other types of utility customers would be to include such utilities in section 3 of the bill, 
Exemptions.  
 
Versant team members are currently exploring what specific impacts LD 1845 would have on operations and 
compliance and we would be pleased to provide more information at the work session upon your request. If the 
committee has any specific questions or information requests, I would be happy to work with the Versant team 
and your analyst to provide such follow up at the work session. Thank you for your consideration.
