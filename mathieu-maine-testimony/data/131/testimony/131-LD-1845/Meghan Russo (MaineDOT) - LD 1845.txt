Testimony of Meghan Russo  
Maine Department of Transportation  
Before the 131st Legislature, Joint Standing Committee Environment and Natural 
Resources  
 
In Opposition to LD 18 45 
 
An Act to Regulate Outdoor Lighting  
_____________________________________________________________  
 
Senator Brenner , Representative Gramlich  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources , I am Meghan Russo , Manager of Legislative and Constituent 
Services for MaineDOT .  MaineDOT  submits this legislation in opposition to  LD 1845, An Act to 
Regulate Outdoor Lighting.    
 
This bill seeks to prohibit outdoor lighting fixtures that are not shielded to direct light d ownward.  While 
this bill exempts lighting on I-95, MaineDOT currently installs fixtures  on all roadways within our 
jurisdiction that would be compliant with the bill’s requirements , in accordance with 23 MRSA §708 .  
However, MaineDOT’s offices in Augusta,  region offices, and our many maintenance facilities across the 
state would be impacted by this legislation.  These facilities are li t in a way to protect MaineDOT 
employees , many who are deemed essential, and  are required to report to work at all hours of the day  and 
night.  MaineDOT’s headquarter offices here in Augusta are staffed 24 hours a day.   
 
As drafted the provisions within LD 1845 would  also negatively impact MaineDOT’s contracting 
partners, ma ny of whom we rely on to perform the needed projects to Maine’s transportation 
infrastructure.  MaineDOT has certain projects that require strictly night work, for the safety of our 
contractor and the traveling public.  Restricting the available lighting m echanisms on these projects could 
endanger both our contractors and motorists navigating this construction zone.  
 
Should this bill pass and MaineDOT be required to change the lighting fixtures at all of our facilities, 
there would be a significant cost as sociated with this, and therefore substantial fiscal note.  
 
It is for these reasons that we urge the committee to vote ought not to pass on LD 1845.  Thank you.
