RE:
LD
1845,
A
n
Act
to
Regulate
Outdoor
Lighting
Dear
Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
Members
of
the
Committee:
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
in
support
of
LD
1845,
A
n
Act
to
Regulate
Outdoor
Lighting
,
on
behalf
of
Maine
Audubon
and
our
30,000
members,
supporters,
and
volunteers.
Outdoor
lighting
has
a
significant,
negative
impact
on
wildlife.
Like
humans,
animals
and
plants
live
by
a
rhythm
that
is
attuned
to
our
planet’ s
24-hour
lightness
and
darkness
cycle.
Similar
to
what
humans
experience
when
their
circadian
rhythms
are
disrupted
(such
as
when
they
change
time
zones
and
during
daylight
savings
time),
wildlife
experience
a
disorientation
of
time
when
there
is
too
much
artificial
light
at
night.
This
“disorientation”
has
population-level
impacts
and
is
fairly
easily
avoided.
For
these
reasons
and
more,
Maine
Audubon
supports
LD
1845.
Artificial
light
–
including
“urban
sky
glow”
(brightening
over
inhabited
areas)
and
light
falling
where
it
is
not
intended,
wanted,
or
needed
–
impacts
all
wildlife,
including
mammals,
amphibians,
reptiles,
birds,
and
insects.
Impacts
to
birds
and
insects
are
of
particular
interest
to
Maine
Audubon.
Many
species
of
birds
migrate
or
hunt
at
night,
making
them
extremely
vulnerable
to
bright
lights
in
areas
that
are
naturally
dark.
Artificial
lights,
including
“urban
sky
glow ,”
can
cause
migrating
birds
to
wander
of f
course
and
either
never
reach
their
intended
destination
or
unnecessarily
expend
ener gy
needed
upon
their
arrival
at
their
intended
destination.
A
2010
study
comparing
reproductive
behavior
of
Blue
T its
breeding
in
edge
territories
with
and
without
street
lights
found
that
artificial
light
caused
female
Blue
T its
to
start
laying
eggs
earlier ,
which
may
lead
to
a
mismatch
between
the
time
of
peak
food
demand
from
the
of fspring
in
the
nest
and
the
peak
in
food
availability .

Moths
and
other
insects
are
attracted
to
artificial
lights
and
may
stay
near
that
light
all
night.
This
activity
expends
unnecessary
ener gy ,
interferes
with
mating
and
migration,
and
leaves
insects
exceedingly
vulnerable
to
predators.
Studies
have
shown
that
light
pollution
is
a
driver
of
insect
decline,
along
with
habitat
loss,
pesticide
use,
invasive
species,
and
climate
change.

Thankfully ,
light
pollution
is
unique
among
anthropogenic
habitat
disturbances
in
that
it
is
fairly
easy
to
ameliorate.
This
bill
includes
a
prime
amelioration
strategy:
shielding
outdoor
lights
and
limiting
the
use
of
unshielded
outdoor
lights,
with
exceptions.
A
light
is
“shielded”
if
it
is
accompanied
by
a
shield
or
other
device
that
ensures
that
light
emitted
from
the
fixture
is
projected
below
the
horizontal
plane
running
above
the
emitting
light.
Shielding
lights
helps
direct
light
to
where
it
is
actually
needed
and
significantly
reduces
impacts
to
wildlife.
Shielding
reduces
wattage
and
in
turn
is
a
cost
saver .
While
Maine
Audubon
ultimately
supports
this
bill
and
believes
the
state
must
actively
pursue
strategies
to
address
the
harm
of
light
pollution,
we
appreciate
that
some
might
view
the
bill
as
“too
much,
too
fast.”
W ith
that
in
mind,
we
of fer
the
following:
Require
shielded
lights
and
required
“turn
of f”
times,
with
exceptions,
in
public
improvements;
that
the
Department
of
Administrative
and
Financial
Services,
Bureau
of
General
Services
develop
an
outdoor
lighting
guide
to
be
made
available
for
public
use;
and
report
delivered
back
to
the
Committee
on
progress
incorporating
shielded
lights,
etc.
into
public
improvements,
with
the
ability
of
the
Committee
to
put
out
legislation
based
on
the
report.
W e
have
pursued
a
similar
approach,
with
success
to
date,
on
a
bill
to
incorporate
bird
and
wildlife
risk-management
strategies
into
architectural
design.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely ,
Eliza
Donoghue,
Esq.
Director
of
Advocacy
