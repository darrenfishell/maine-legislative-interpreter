Dark Sky tourism is a huge, untapped marketplace for Maine, which I learned at last 
year's Governor's Conference on Tourism. 
Regulating outdoor lighting is the critical first step to solving the problem of light 
pollution, it will help with night time visibility, reduce harmful and dangerous glare, 
and improve the health and wellbeing of Maine's wildlife.
Please pass this bill!
