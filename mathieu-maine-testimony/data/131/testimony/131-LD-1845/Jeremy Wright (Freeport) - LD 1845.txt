LD 1845
Dear Committee,
Please consider supporting standards to encourage dark-sky friendly lighting in 
Maine, especially for government and commercial lighting installations.  
LD 1845 as written is very flawed and should be amended, but I do support adopting 
basic state-wide standards.  I suggest the committee consider changes offered by the 
group Southern Maine Astronomers, which are thoughtful, technically sound, and 
minimize the burden of compliance. 
Light fixtures that are dark-sky friendly - shielded and with low color temperature - 
usually do not cost more and are no less functional.  Any rules should be directed 
toward new installations and replacement. 
Most towns and many businesses are actively replacing lights with LEDs to save 
electricity, which is great.  This also means timeliness is important.  The right choices
now will preserve and maybe improve our dark skies, and the wrong choices will do 
the opposite.
Respectfully,
Jeremy Wright
