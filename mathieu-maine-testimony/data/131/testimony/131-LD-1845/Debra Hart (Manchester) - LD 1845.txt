LD 1845, An Act to Regulate Outdoor Lighting 
 
 
 
My name is Debra Hart.  I am a resident of Manchester, Maine and am providing these 
comments on behalf of the Maine Campground Owners Association in opposition to LD 
1845.   
 
Campgrounds is a type of lodging that is utilized both by campers who come for a night, a 
week, or a month, along with permanent campers who spend an entire season at a 
campground.  It is part of an outdoor experience where guests expect an experience of 
being outdoors and where they may enjoy nature and all that Maine has to offer.  Being an 
outdoor experience also means there needs to be attention paid to the safety of guests.  
There are animals that are out at night and paths that need to be illuminated to avoid any 
number of instances where a guest can trip or fall causing an injury.  No campground wants 
to be illuminated to the point where guests cannot enjoy themselves, but safety is also an 
important concern. 
 
Specifically spotlights or a security light would not be shielded and permanent campers 
may have a lighting fixtures that are not necessarily shielded.  Trying to police what 
campers do in a specific area would be burdensome and likely impossible to enforce. 
 
As campground owners our prime concern is the safety of our guests dealing with a 
changing landscape that can be different on a daily basis.   We respectfully ask that you vote 
this bill ought not to pass.
