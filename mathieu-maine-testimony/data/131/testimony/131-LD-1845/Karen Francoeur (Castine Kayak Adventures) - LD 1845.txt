LD 1845 Act to Regulate Lighting testimony
Attention:  Environment and Natural Resources Committee,
Thank you for taking the time to consider initiating legislation to minimize light 
pollution in Maine. 
Long term light pollution is an ever increasing growing problem that is easily 
addressed by educating the public about the harmful effects of excessive lighting and 
implementing laws that minimize light and regulate fixtures. 
 
As an economic driver, our night sky is worth preserving. At Castine Kayak we offer 
nightly sea kayak tours every night in Castine’s Bioluminescent Bay observing the 
natural phenomena of bioluminescent, glowing phytoplankton and also offer a 
floating planetarium pointing out the stars, planets and milky way to thousands of 
tourists each summer.  We are fully booked most nights! These tourists are important 
economic drivers for our inns, restaurants and tourism in general. Astro Tourism is 
also a major economic driver in northern Maine.   Looking at national parks 
throughout the nation, astronomy and astro tourism programs are many parks most 
popularly attended events.   
Excessive light pollution negatively affects our entire ecosystem.  Scientific studies 
have proven its negative impact leading to depression, obesity and cancer.  Too much 
light without a light and dark cycle, affects all nocturnal animals that are such an 
important part of our ecosystem, as well as humans.  Too much light affects our 
nocturnal pollinators such as moths, bats and more.  And even in the water, too much 
light alters productivity of sea life at the core of the food chain.  One study of light’s 
effect on clown fish reproduction showed that clownfish exposed to continual light 
proved a 100% failure to reproduce with constant light.  Creatures all have a natural 
circadian rhythm that is negatively affected by constant light.  
Excessive lighting is also a huge waste of electricity and money. Outdoor lighting 
also releases tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.  This is a situation 
that can be easily addressed and save the state of Maine money.
At Castine Kayak we have partnered with a group of children from the Adams school 
to educate the public about the importance of minimizing light pollution.  I have 
attached a postcard that we created to educate the public.  
Thank you for taking the time to consider the importance of taking action to minimize
light pollution.  This is a very fixable problem that can be easily addressed with 
minimal action.  
Sincerely,
