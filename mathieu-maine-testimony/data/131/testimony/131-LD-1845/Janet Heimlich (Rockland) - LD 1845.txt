Hello, thank you for considering this important issue. I only have recently learned 
about the benefits of preserving the night sky. My main concern is the health of 
humans, animals and insects. However, I understand too that there is a huge cost 
savings to taking measures with lighting to preserve the night sky. As someone who 
suffers from insomnia, I know how important it is to have warm (no blue) lighting so 
that our brains know that it is night time. I don’t think it’s a big sacrifice to ask 
homeowners, companies, schools, etc. not to have blaring lights that last all night 
long. Lights don’t need to be removed. They just need to be modified and safety is not
jeopardized. I would love for there to be some common sense regulations to preserve 
our health, the longevity of bees and other insects and species, and give us and our 
children the chance to learn from the stars every night of the week, wherever they are.
