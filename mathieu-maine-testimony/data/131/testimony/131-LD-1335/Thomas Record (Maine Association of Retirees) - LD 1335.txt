Q55 TESTIMONY OF THOMAS RECORD 
MAINE ASSOCIATION OF RETIREES 
NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST 
LD 1335, AN ACT TO AMEND THE PROPERTY TAX STABILIZATION FOR SENIOR CITIZENS 
PRESENTED TO THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TAXATION 
APRIL 12, 2023 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, Members of the Committee, I am Thomas Record, Vice 
President of the Maine Association of Retirees (MAR) and testify today on its behalf. MAR is a nonproﬁt 
organization comprised of more than 12,000 public service retirees including retired educators, state 
employees, legislators, judges and retirees from participating local districts. 
As MAR has testified on previous bills, the Property Tax Stabilization Act which was enacted last 
year has proven very popular among our members. The vast majority of MAR members are of modest 
means. Their retirement incomes based on their public service do not come close to keeping up with 
inﬂation. They are looking for any way they can to limit their exposure to rising costs such as property 
taxes.t 
We understand and appreciate the Committee ’s desire to take a holistic approach to the large 
number of bills before you regarding the Stabilization Act and the Homestead Exemption. MAR looks 
forward to your ongoing work regarding these topics. 
Please advise if MAR can be of any assistance. Thank you.
