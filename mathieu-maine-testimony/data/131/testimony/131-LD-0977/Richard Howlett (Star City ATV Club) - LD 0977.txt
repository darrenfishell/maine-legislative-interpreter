IFW LESGISLATIVE COMMITTEE: 
I was on the governor's task force in 2019, this task force was made up of 
mostly landowners. For 3 months we listened to the problems that the 
landowners were having with atv's. We was able to correct a lot of the problems 
by limiting the size of the atv's & utvâ€˜s , following BMP erosion guidelines, & giving 
more money to atv clubs. This all came with a cost. The committee decided that 
the atv registration should be raised from $45 to $70. A year before that 
registration went from $33 to $45. Registration has gone up $37 in 4 years. 
Committee didn't want to talk about the gas tax. We think it's time that atv's get 
there share of the gas tax. When the study was done in 2001 there was only 
45,796 registered atv's. Those machines used 1,922,841 gallons of gas and paid 
$423,025 per year in gas taxes. In 2018, there was 72,076 registered Atv's, which 
was a 160% increase and now with the side by side vehicles and as of 2022 there 
were 82,322 registered machines. Snowmobiles had 95,334 registrations in 2001, 
using 8,336,275 gallons of gas and paying $1,883,981 per year in gas taxes. In 
2018 snowmobile registrations dropped 7% to 88,066 registrations. 
THE PROBLEM: According to the snowmobile trail fund revenue distribution 
for the fiscal year 2022 snowmobiles are shown paying $1,833,981 in tax on 
95,334 registered machines, and the program is receiving $1,505,237 of the gas 
tax revenue on approximately 85,000 registrations. As for the atv recreation 
management fund for the fiscal year 2022. Atv's are shown paying $366,189 in 
tax on 39,643 machines and the Atv program receiving just $149,162 on 82,322 
registered machines. So it's plane to see that it is really lopped sided. All we 
want is our share of the gas tax, Atv registrations have been increasing every 
year & every time the atv program needs money you can keep increasing 
registration fees. Thank you for your time
