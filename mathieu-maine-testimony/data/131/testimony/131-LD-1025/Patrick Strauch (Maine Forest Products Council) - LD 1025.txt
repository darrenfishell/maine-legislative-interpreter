Testimony in Support of  LD 1025  
 
“An Act to Improve Maine’s Economy by Changing the 
Hours of Operation for Oversize Loads ”

Patrick Strauch, Executive  Director  
 
Senator Chipman , Representative Williams and members of the Committee 
Transportation , my name is Patrick Strauch,  and I am here on behalf of the 
Maine Forest Products Council in support of  LD 1025 , “An Act to Improve 
Maine’s Economy by Changing the Hours of Operation for Oversize 
Loads .”  
 While I can’t speak to the specific recommendations provided by this bill, the Council’s Policy Committee felt strongly that we should support efforts 
to improve Maine’s overside load laws in order to create efficiencies for the 
industry. Under the current rules, the transport of oversize loads even over 
short distances, can be costly and time consuming. While we aren’t wedded 
to any specific recommendation provided by this bill, the Council would encourage the Transportation Committee to work with the Main e State 
Police to identify adjustments that can be made to create efficiencies for 
Maine businesses  with safety in mind.  
 
For these reasons , please consider supporting LD 1025 . 
 Thank you.
