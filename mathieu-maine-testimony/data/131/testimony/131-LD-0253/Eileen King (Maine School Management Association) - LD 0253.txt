TESTIMONY NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 253  
 
AN ACT TO ADD HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS  
TO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA  STANDARDS  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. I 
am Eileen King, deputy executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School  Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, neither for nor against L.D. 253.  
 
School Boards and superintendents support the concept of keeping our students physically active, and we 
believe our districts already are giving at least a year of health and physical education . 
 
Our associations are neither for nor against the bill because we’ve consistently been opposed to curriculum 
mandates.  
 
Mandating additional graduation  expectations limits a student’s ability to participate in extended  learning 
opportunities and will affect those students who travel to attend Career and Technical Education programs. 
We also believe it will require more staff.  
 
If the sponsor wants to put a requirement in law, we suggest the requirement should be one year  since that is 
the practice in most districts.
