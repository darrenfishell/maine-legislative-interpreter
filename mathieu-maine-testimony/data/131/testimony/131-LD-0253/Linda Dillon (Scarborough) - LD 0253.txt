I am writing in support of LD 253: An Act to Add Health and Physical Education 
Requirements to High School Diploma Standards.
I have worked in the health field for over 30 years and in that time I have witnessed 
many changes that, from my experience, have affected our society in challenging 
ways. Increasingly children are not always getting the support that they need at home 
in the areas that support healthy lifestyle or communication which is why it is even 
more crucial to receive these services in our educational system.
Health topics for education involving physical fitness and the care of the body are still
very much needed as well as the importance of caring about our children's mental 
health in our state. I believe it is vital that our children have the educational tools 
provided by health educators in order for our children to have a better chance of being
able to contribute positively to society. Health of our body and mind affects our 
everyday life and those around us. It is my hope and expectation that we add Health 
and Physical Education requirements to the High School diploma standard. Thank 
you.
