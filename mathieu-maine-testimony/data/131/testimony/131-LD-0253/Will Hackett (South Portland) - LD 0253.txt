Since the Pandemic so many student have fallen out of the habit of being healthy. 
Health and PE not only provide students with opportunities to get up and move their 
bodies, it also allows a space for our youth to learn the importance of taking care of 
themselves both physically and mentally. Obesity and Mental health are plaguing this 
nation, and I believe that Health and PE classes are a huge part of the solution. In my 
experience students are much more likely to choose to sit on a device, play video 
games, watch tv, or sleep; instead of wanting to go outside, move their bodies, engage
with each other in positive healthy ways.
