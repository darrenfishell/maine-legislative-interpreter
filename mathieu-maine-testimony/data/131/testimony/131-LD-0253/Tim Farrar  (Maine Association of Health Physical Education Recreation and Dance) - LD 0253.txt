I am writing on behalf of LD 250  An Act to Add Health and Physical Education 
Requirements to High School Diploma Standards.
As an educator for over 20 years and parent of two teenage students, it is clear to me 
the value of our personal wellness.  All students and communities in our state need to 
have a clear message from this committee and the legislature as a whole that Wellness
education matters, and that Health and Physical Education are pillars of a Maine 
education.  
The old days of rolling the ball out PE  and changing the slide when the bell rings Health class
are gone.  Our modern classes offer a wide variety of activities and dimensions of personal 
health, all geared toward finding personal success that students can carry with them into adult
life.
Modern Health and Physical Education are the experiential lab that deals with something that 
is with us the rest of our lives, our minds and bodies.  Understanding  those things a little 
better can help all students navigate adulthood.  Serving on the Maine Association of Health 
Physical Education Recreation and Dance Board, that represents Maineâ€™s Wellness 
Educators, I have gotten to see the innovative practices that our teachers use to reach our 
students.  This bill would ensure that high standard of a Maine Public Education would 
permanently and explicitly include Health and Physical Education.
Please consider LD 250 and its implications for our long range, Statewide level of 
health, and pass this bill.  
Sincerely
