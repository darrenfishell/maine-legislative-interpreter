Health and Physical Education – Not Specials, They Are 
Essentials
Paul Kaplan
America is the center of the globalizing culture that has been influencing our health 
since the inception of the internet. This culture brings byproducts that have continued to 
reap social, fiscal, and bodily harm. Nationally, we have been seeing upward trends in the 
prevalence of the amount of poor nutrition seen, chronic conditions, mental health 
problems, and suicides (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). The 
opportunity for Physical Education and Health to become a graduation requirement is the 
crossroads at which we have the ability to improve the general health of our population.
LD 253 is a testament to the value of quality of life in our state. Physical Education 
and Health education teaches foundational knowledge for young adults to become life-long 
self-reliant citizens. One huge downfall of our educational system is the inability of our 
adolescent population to prevail through their developing years. The second highest 
ranking death risk for adolescents is suicide behind accidental deaths (Maine Department 
of Health and Human Services, 2022). Physical Education and Health Education have the 
ability to better prepare our young adult to find healthy outlets that will lead to a higher 
chance of our young adults become healthy adults.
Generation A is a generation of processed foods. The intake of our population that 
we see in our school is building a culture of the acceptance of these processed foods as well, 
with the danger as a misunderstood risk. Knowing that some of our middle school students 
do not understand that a fruit roll up is not a form of real fruit, our students need this 
education. At the high school level, the education that this bill would mandate could change 
the lives of students who have not received this knowledge. To provide this knowledge to a 
population before they have developed their adult habits, the educational system would be 
the one providing real health care, not the sick care that the hospitals advertise. 
This bill is not a bill to eliminate the risk of health factors in our growing 
populations, this bill would seek to reduce the disparities of health risks across 
demographics (Ross, Mann, Emond, 2023). It is known that populations that have poorer 
health are likely to be populations that are poorer economically (Mink, 1993). All people 
receiving quality health and physical education will provide the knowledge for those who 
are less likely to receive that knowledge through the culture of their families or 
backgrounds and given them a chance to improve their situation as they grow.
It is surprising that LD 253 has taken until 2023 to hopefully come to fruition. Let us 
all hope that it does not take the wake of a pandemic to realize the value of public health. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
