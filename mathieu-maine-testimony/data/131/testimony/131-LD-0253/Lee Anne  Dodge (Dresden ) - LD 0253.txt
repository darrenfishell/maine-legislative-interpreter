Dear Committee Members,
As a certified substance use prevention specialist, it is critical that health and physical 
education classes be included in the requirements for High School Diploma Standards. 
Students have gone through a very difficult time during COVID and after and it is so important
that they learn about physical and mental health more than ever, including coping skills and 
healthy alternatives to using substances. We have seen an increase in vaping and cannabis 
use over the past few years (some students started using in 7th grade during COVID) and are
now addicted to nicotine and/or cannabis. In the past we have done prevention and now the 
focus is on intervention and even treatment for youth. We have health all of our lives, and we 
know that the brain is best for learning without much effort from ages 13-20 so we must 
provide lifelong skills to youth so that they become healthy adults.
