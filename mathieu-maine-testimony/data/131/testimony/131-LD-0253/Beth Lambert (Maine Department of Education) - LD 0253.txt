Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:   
LD 253, An Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma 
Standards,  proposes that two years of health and physical education requirements, or the 
equivalent in standards achievement, be added to the requirements for receiving a high school 
diploma.   
The State diploma requirements reflect the minimum required by the State in order for a school 
administrative un it (SAU) to award a high school diploma. All SAUs have the ability, through 
local policy, to add requirements to these minimums.  
There are two existing statutes that require the teaching of health and physical education. The 
first is ยง 6209, System of lear ning results established,  that requires SAUs to offer a 
comprehensive program of study that includes instruction for all students in the content areas of 
the Maine Learning Results, including, health and physical education. The second is Title 20 -A, 
ยง4723,  Health and physical education, which outlines requirements for health and physical 
education at the secondary level. While the amount of instruction time or equivalent in standards 
achievement is not noted, most school administrative units have well estab lished health and 
physical education programs.  
Data from the Maine Integrated School Health Survey tell us that our students face significant 
physical, mental, social, and emotional health issues. Studies addressing the priorities of 
businesses state that  health literacy and physical literacy are among their top concerns as those 
skills and knowledge provide a solid foundation for work ethics and work life balance.  
The Department will be available to provide additional information on LD 253 and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.   
 
 
Sincerely,

Director of Innovat ive Teaching and Lea rning
