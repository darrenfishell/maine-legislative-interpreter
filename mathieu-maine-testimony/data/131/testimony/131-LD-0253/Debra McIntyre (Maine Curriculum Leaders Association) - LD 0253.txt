Testimony of Debra Mclntyre, Executive Director, on behalf of the members of the Maine 
Curriculum Leaders Association, testifying neither for nor against LD 253 An Act to Add 
Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma Standards. 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs 
Committee, my name is Debra Mclntyre and I am the Executive Director of the Maine 
Curriculum Leaders Association. On behalf of the members of MCLA I am testifying neither for 
nor against LD 253 An Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School 
Diploma Standards. 
While the membership fully supports requiring health and physical education as a diploma 
requirement, requiring 2 years or the equivalent in standards achievement for a diploma, will be 
a hardship for many if not all districts The proposed bill is calling for a 2 year diploma 
requirement in Health and Physical Education, which would have a significant budgetary impact 
on many school districts in order to hire additional staff to offer more health and/or physical 
education courses. ln addition, the impact this requirement may have on students and their 
flexibility for courses could have negative results by restricting course selection and possible 
career pathways. 
100% of the districts sun/eyed currently have a diploma requirement for health and physical 
education, with the majority requiring 1 ‘/2 credits (total). 
MCLA is neither for nor against LD 253.Thank you for your time.
