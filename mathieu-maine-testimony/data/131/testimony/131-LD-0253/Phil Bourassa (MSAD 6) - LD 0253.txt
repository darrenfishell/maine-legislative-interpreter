LD 253
My name is Phil Bourassa and I am in my 15th year as a Health/Physical Education 
teacher at Bonny Eagle High School. The information on how to properly be 
physically active, eat healthy, combat mental health issues, drug/alcohol risk 
reduction, and so much more, in my opinion, is the most important for a high school 
aged student to know. We teach students to be clear and effective communicators by 
providing them with the opportunity to practice using affirmative consent, refusal 
skills, and negotiation skills in realistic situations that they may encounter throughout 
their lives. To ensure that our students are provided this incredibly important 
information is the right thing to do.  I ask you to vote in favor of L.D. 253 and 
reinstate Health Education and Physical Education as graduation requirements.
