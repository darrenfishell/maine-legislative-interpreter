Testimony  
Neither for Nor Against  
LD 257: An Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma 
Standards.

February 9, 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and other esteemed members of the Committee on  Education 
and Cultural Affairs,  
 
My name is Mallory Cook (pronouns she/her/hers), and I am the Director of Training and Early 
Educator Engagement at the Maine Education Association, and a certified English teacher and Building 
Administrator. I am here to provide testimony neither for nor against LD 253: An Act to Add Health and 
Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma Standards.  
 
Title 20 -A, §4723 requires that secondary studies include instruction on health, safety, and physical 
education; h owever, courses in health and physical education are not currently listed as high school 
diploma standards. Despite this, most , if not all , require one year of physical education and a semester of 
health.  
 
Physical education courses are paramount in preparing students for healthy, active lifestyles during their 
time in high school and following their graduation. According to the Centers for Dis ease Control, 
students who are enrolled in physical education are 2 -3 times more likely to be active outside of school, 
and almost twice as likely to continue to be active into adulthood. Nationwide, only 27% of high school 
students get the 60 minutes of p hysical activity recommended per day (CDC); however, the most recent 
Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey (MIYHS) data for Maine showed that 50% of Maine high school 
students are active for 60 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week. While some of this c an be attributed 
to sports participation, some of this activity can also be attributed to physical education courses. 55.9% 
of freshmen, 38.7% of sophomores, 21.6% of juniors, and 21.2% of seniors reported attending a physical 
education course at least onc e per week. 1  
 
Health curriculum is also essential for preparing our students to maintain safe and healthy lifestyles. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, high quality health curriculum can reduce the likelihood

academic performance.  
 
Should the committee choose to move forward with this bill, MEA recommends amending the proposed 
credit hours from 2 to 1.5, accounting for one credit of physical educatio n and one semester of health. 
This aligns with what most districts already have as graduation requirements. In making this decision, 
we must be mindful that any graduation requirement added has the potential to take away an opportunity 
to engage in a cours e that aligns with a student’s ambitions, interests, and needs. While physical 
education and health are essential, it is our belief that other courses, including the arts, world languages, 
and career and technical offerings, are just as  impactful.  
 
Than k you for your time.
