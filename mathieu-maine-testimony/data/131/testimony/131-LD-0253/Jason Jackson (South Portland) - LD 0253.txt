In support of LD 253 "An Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to
High School Diploma Standards" 
Over the past couple of decades, I feel like Health and PE are not as valued in school. It 
seems it has really lost it’s value in high school in particular. When I was growing up in the 
80’s and 90’s, PE and Health were graduation requirements. One had to take those classes 
just as serious as other core classes. As a student I took pride in participating in
PE and knew the importance of Health. Just being active in general seems to be a lost art 
with a large part of our youth. With so many challenges and so many health hazards being 
glorified for the youth in this day age it’s not helping things. Not keeping those things as 
graduation requirements will only make things worse going forward.
I graduated from high school in 1993. I was required to take PE and Health in order to
graduate. The importance of performing in PE and understanding the importance of 
health as an adult has been very beneficial. Over the past 5 to 10 years I have lost 
several peers due to not taking care of their health. These are people who passed away
in their 30’s and 40’s suffering from ailments that usually take place at a much older 
age.
It is important to keep PE and Health as graduation requirements because knowing 
and taking care of your body physically and mentally can make the difference 
between life and death. 
Thank you,
