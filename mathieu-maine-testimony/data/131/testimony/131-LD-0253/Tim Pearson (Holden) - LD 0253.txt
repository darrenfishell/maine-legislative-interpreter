Dear Legislature,
I am writing this letter in support of the L.D. 253 "An Act to Add Health and Physical
Education Requirements to High School Diploma Standards".   As I write this letter 
my first impulse was to include all the shocking statistics regarding the current state 
of health in Maine and the nation.   I don’t need to.  Walk into Walmart any day and 
observe the children and adults and you can see that with your own eyes.  My second 
impulse was to bombard you with the scientific studies that show the positive effects 
of physical education on students' academics and social emotional wellness but I’m 
sure others will do that this morning. Instead, I will cut to the chase.  As a 36 year 
veteran teacher in Maine Public Schools I have learned that the bottom line in 
education is that the subjects that are required by law are taken seriously by school 
boards, administrators, teachers, parents and students.  Those that aren’t required by 
law are not.  These subjects, although included in the State of Maine Learning 
Results, are not taken seriously.  In the ever present educational battle for time in the 
school day schedule, staffing and financial resources, physical & health education is 
neglected or even left out.  L.D. 253 "An Act to Add Health and Physical Education 
Requirements to High School Diploma Standards would help change this.
I will close with the following quote by John F. Kennedy. “Intelligence and skills can 
only function at the peak of their capacity when the body is healthy and strong. I 
believe that physical and health education, when taught by qualified and supported 
educators, is not only valuable but necessary for students' futures.   If you truly value 
our current and future generations health and wellness you will support L.D. 253 "An 
Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma 
Standards" 
Thank you,
Timothy J Pearson
