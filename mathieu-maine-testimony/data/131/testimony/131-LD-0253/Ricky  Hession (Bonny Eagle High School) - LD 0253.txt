Bonny Eagle High School
LD 253
My name is Ricky Hession and I am in my 10th year as a Health/Physical Education 
teacher at Bonny Eagle High School. The education and exploration of physical 
activity, proper nutrition,  mental health, drug/alcohol risk reduction, and much more, 
are the most important topics for a high school aged student to know. We teach 
students to be clear and effective communicators by providing them with the 
opportunity to practice using affirmative consent, refusal skills, and negotiation skills 
in realistic situations that they may encounter throughout their lives. We also give the 
students an opportunity to be physically active on a consistent basis in an age which 
high school aged students are as sedentary as they have ever been. To ensure that our 
students are provided this incredibly important information is the right thing to do.  I 
ask you to vote in favor of L.D. 253 and reinstate Health Education and Physical 
Education as graduation requirements.
