As a 24-year PE teacher, I would like to urge you to put Health and PE requirements 
back into the high school diploma standards. PE has come a long way since "back in 
the day" and what is taught in both PE and Health is VITAL for students in today's 
world. Social-emotional learning, skills for lifetime wellness, working with others, 
learning about our bodies and how best to take care of them, personal responsibility, 
and problem solving are just a few of the many important things taught in today's PE 
and Health classes. In today's technology driven world, PE and Health are even more 
important now than they used to be. Please put PE and Health requirements back into 
high school diploma standards.
