Testimony of Hilary Schneider, Regional Government Relations Director,  
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  
 
In Support of LD 253  “An Act to Add Health and Physical Education Requirements to High School Diploma 
Standards ” 
 
February 13, 2023  
 
Senator Rafferty , Representative Brennan , and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee . My 
name is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the Atlantic/North Region for 
the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the lead Government 
Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer 
Society, supports evidence -based policy and le gislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health 
problem. As the nation’s leading advocate for public policies that are helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures 
that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a voice in public p olicy matters at all levels of 
government.  
One in two men and 1 in 3 women are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.i The American 
Cancer Society estimates that 8,920 Mainers will be diagnosed with cancer and that 3,500  will die from the  
disease in this year alone.ii Cancer is the leading cause of death in Maine.iii  
The connections between physical inactivity and diseases like heart disease and diabetes are well known, but 
many are surprised to learn that physical inactivity, along with p oor diet and excess weight, are second only to 
tobacco use as major cancer risk factors.iv An unhealthful diet, excess body weight, alcohol consumption and 
physical inactivity account for at least 18.2% of cancer cases and 15.8% of cancer deaths in the U.S .v Excess body 
fat causes nearly 15 types of  cancer : breast (postmenopausal), endometrium, kidney (renal cell), esophagus 
(adenocarcinoma), colon, rectum, gastric cardia, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, ovary, thyroid, myeloma and 
meningioma.vi Being overweight or obese is also linked to an increased risk of cancer recurrence, decreased 
quality of life, and a lower chance of survival for many cancers.vii,viii The research is clear - maintaining a healthy 
weight and staying physically active through out life are among the best ways to reduce the risk of developing 
and dying from cancer.ix    
Despite the evidence linking excess weight, poor nutrition, excess alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity to 
increased cancer risk, most Americans do not me et recommended nutrition and physical activity targets.x Social, 
economic, environmental, and cultural factors strongly influence individual choices about diet and physical 
activity. Reversing obesity trends and reducing the associated cancer risk will re quire a broad range of strategies 
that include policy and environmental changes that make it easier for individuals to regularly make healthy diet 
and physical activity choices, and access to evidence -based treatment for obesity.  
Unfortunately, many school -aged children are not at a healthy weight or are not physically active. In the United 
States, n early 20  percent of children ages 2 -19 are obese.xi The most recent data for Maine indicates that only

are overweight or obese is slightly below the national average, it has been increasing since 2018 and rising at a 
rate higher than the national average.xiii To make matters worse,  nationally,  daily physical activity among yout h 
has been declining for the past several decades ,xiv and Maine’s data reflects this trend as well.xv While experts 
across the country have highlighted the importance of both quality physical education as well as physical activity 
among youth, many school -age children do not meet national recommendations for either.xvi,xvii The high 
prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents, coupled with inactivity, puts too many of them at 
risk.  We know that children who are overweight and obese are more likely to be overweight and obese adults, 
increasing their risk for developing cancer and a host of other chronic diseases.xviii, xix, xx, xxi 
The benefits of quality physical education and physical activity for youth extend far beyond the classroom. In 
addition to decreased long -term cancer risk, other positive health outcomes associated with being p hysically 
active include less body fat, improved muscular strength and heart health, reduced anxiety and depression 
symptoms, and enhanced self -esteem.xxii  
Children who are more active have also demonstrated higher scholastic achievement, better classroom 
behavior, greater ability to focus, and less absenteeism compared  to their unfit peers.xxiii, xxiv, xxv, xxvi, xxvii   Helping 
children to establish healthy habits when they are young, including at least an hour of daily physical activity, is 
one of the best ways to se t them on a path toward lifelong health and lower cancer risk.   
Quality physical education is the best way for children and adolescents to reach their activity goals and gain the 
knowledge and skills they need to be physically active for the rest of their  lives. A quality program should be 
standards -based, sequential, and available to all students in grades K -12 as part of the yearly curriculum. To be 
effective, these programs engage students in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least half of t he 
physical education class time. Trained, licensed, and certified physical educators should be responsible for 
teaching physical education; like teachers in other disciplines, they must receive regular, field -specific 
professional development. Quality phy sical education programs must have adequate facilities and equipment 
and a student -to-teacher ratio that is comparable to other subjects.  General waivers, substitutions for other 
courses or activities, or exemptions for test prep or other assignments shou ld not be allowed.   
We look to our leaders to support and help promote efforts that improve our children’s health and 
simultaneously help boost academic achievement. Ensuring every child in Maine has access to quality physical 
education and opportunities for additional regular physical activity will afford our children the opportunity to 
lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives.  
While the evidence demonstrates the need for quality, physical education as part of the annual  curriculum for K -
12, LD 253 is a step in the right direction by establishing in statute that physical education  is part of Maine’s high 
school graduation requirements. For these reasons , we urge you to vote “ought to pass” on  LD 253.  
We appreciate your tim e and consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about 
this testimony.
