IMD Waiver Could increase the use of AOT-PTP in Maine 
1) One federally funded advocacy organization said,“we oppose these type of forced 
community mental health treatment laws because for one thing, we know of no, like, 
peer review, randomized studies suggesting that a court-ordered commitment — 
committing individuals to an assertive community treatment orACT team — for mental 
health treatment alone improves treatment outcomes” 
a) The fact is, SAMHSA added assisted outpatient commitment to the National 
Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP) back in 2015, 
after an independent assessment concluded the program met its requirements 
for demonstrating_positive outcomes in multiple rigorous peer-reviewed studies 
The value of the intervention for qualifying individuals is also recognized by the 
American Psychiatric Association, the National Sheriffs ’ Association and the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police 
b) The NREPP was a publicly available online database of mental health and 
substance abuse inten/entions To be recognized as evidence-based, 
interventions had to meet NREPP‘s requirements for review and be 
independently assessed and rated for quality of research and readiness for 
dissemination 
c) SAMHSA's designation also followed recognition of AOT by the US Department 
of Justice, whose Ofﬁce of Justice Programs deemed it to be an effective and 
evidence-based practice for reducing crime and violence in 2012 Forty-seven 
states and the District of Columbia currently authorize the use of some form of 
court-ordered outpatient treatment for individuals with the most severe psychiatric 
illnesses 
d) As stated by Jeanne Gore at the press conference, “This type of early 
intervention has been found to be highly successful in states where it is utilized 
resulting in 77% fewer psychiatric hospitalizations ln addition. 74% fewer 
experienced homelessness, 83% fewer arrests, and 87% fewer incarcerations 
2) This statement has been made repeatedly by our opponents “The IMD waiver would go 
against the 1990 settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit brought against the 
state on behalf of residents of the now-defunct Augusta Mental Health Institute" 
a) As was already stated in our response to the news media on December 6th,“ 
From our IMD Position Statement “The state of Maine did not apply for the 
SMI/SED waiver based on Disability Rights of Maine’s argument claiming it was 
“in violation of the ADA. Olmstead. and the Settlement Agreement ” Their 
arguments are misguided as proven elsewhere in this position statement It's 
time to end this layer of bureaucracy and eliminate the IMD exclusion ” l hope our 
opponents and the public will read our position statement carefully and ﬁnally
