Testimony in Support of LD 328 
An Act to Ensure Access to Federally Approved Opioid 
Overdose-reversing Medication" 
Sponsored by Senator Stewart 
May 10, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the 
Health and Human Services Committees My name is Malory Shaughnessy, I ama 
resident of Westbrook, and the Executive Director of the Alliance for Addiction and 
Mental Health Services The Alliance is the statewide association representing the 
majority of Maine's community-based mental health and substance use treatment 
providers, providing services to over 80,000 Maine men, women, and children The 
Alliance advocates for the implementation of sound policies and evidence-based 
practices that serve to enhance the quality and effectiveness of our behavioral 
health ca re system . 
The Alliance IS in strong support of LD 328, and the amended language presented 
today by Senator Stewart We thank him for his advocacy and sponsorship of this 
legislation LD 328 would update the rules governing a key evidence-based service 
for those facing the challenges of Severe and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI) This 
is Assertive Community Treatment, or the ACT model of care, which emphasizes a 
wrap approach, with a multidisciplinary team providing intensive, individualized 
services to clients with SPMI living in our communities 
The ACT model IS among the most widely and intensively studied intervention 
approaches in community mental healthl We know it works when done well and 
properly supported We have seen it work well in Maine, when it was first 
developed here However, due to changes to the rules made in 2010 combined 
with the stagnant rates, we have seen access to this service decrease steadily over 
the past decade to nearly half of what we once had In this time period, the need 
has only increased and we have seen the impacts in rising demand on our crisis 
services, and in our emergency rooms 
This bill is really quite simple 
1 There should be no fiscal note The rate increase and the change toa 
weekly rate (which IS more appropriate for this type of team-based wrap 
around service) was addressed in the recent rate reform process 
2 This bill will simply align the rules governing this service to more closely 
adhere to the research-based criteria and recommendations 
Please listen to the researchers that have studied this service since the 1980s, and 
TH-Countv Mental Health Services the providers that have been serving this population for decades Please give this
