Senator Baldacc1, Representatlve Meyer and D1st1ngu1shed Members of the J o1nt Standmg 
Commutee on Health and Human Servlces 
I am Senator Trey Stewart, and I represent D1str1ct 2, whlch mcludes several commumtles 1n 
Aroostook County and Northern Penobscot County I am pleased to be here th1s mornlng to 
present to you LD 328, “An Act to Improve Mental Health zn Mame” 
As members of the Health and Human Servlces Commrttee, you are well aware of the mental 
health cr1s1s our state faces Thank you for the long hours and hard work you all put 1n for the 
people of Ma1ne 
Th1s proposal started as a concept draft, and I have attached the proposed amendment to my 
test1mony LD 328 and the accompany1ng language ensures hlgh-quahty, ev1dence-based 
Assertlve Commumty Treatment (ACT) serv1ces for Mame res1dents w1th psychotlc d1sorders 
and h1gh needs by al1gn1ng Ma1neCare regulations W1th the Dartmouth Assertlve Commumty 
Treatment Scale ﬁdehty 1tems 
The ACT model emphasizes a team-based approach, W1th a mult1d1sc1pl1nary team prov1d1ng 
1ntens1ve, 1nd1v1dual1zed servlces to cl1ents 1n the commun1ty The Dartmouth ACT Scale 1s 
used to evaluate the degree to Wl11Cl1 an ACT program adheres to the model and 1dent1fy areas 
where 1mprovements may be needed The Dartmouth ACT Scale mcludes 144 1tems, wh1ch are 
organ1zed 1nto 10 domams, 1nclud1ng team structure, cl1entpart1c1pat1on, and staff quahﬁcauons 
Overall, the Dartmouth ACT Scale 1s a useful tool for ensur1ng that ACT programs are prov1d1ng 
h1gh-quahty, evidence-based serv1ces to 1nd1v1duals W1th severe and perslstent mental lllness 
Mame's mental health cont1nuum of care has faced a detr1mental shortage of ACT due to 
stagnant rates Now, 1n large part due to the rate reform work of th1s Commlttee, the rates have 
rmproved That means provlders can start 1ncreas1ng the ava1lab111ty of ACT However, 1n order 
to tmly meet the ﬁdehty of the ACT serv1ce, we must update the rules to ensure the most 1mpact 
That 1s what th1s proposal does by a11gn1ng Ma1neCare regulatrons w1th the Dartmouth Assertlve 
Commumty Treatment Scale ﬁdel1ty 1tems

Assertrve Commumty Treatment (ACT) has been proven to be effectlve 1n lmprovmg outcomes 
for cllents, reduc1ng hospltahzatrons, and promotlng recovery, however, many 1nd1v1duals st1ll 
do not have access to th1s cr1t1cal servrce Therefore, pol1c1es that 11'1CI‘63.S6 access to ACT are 
essentlal to nnprovmg mental health outcomes for 1nd1v1duals and for the State of Mame asa 
whole 
Thank you very much for your trme and attentron and I appreclate your thoughtful cons1derat1on 
of th1s proposal
