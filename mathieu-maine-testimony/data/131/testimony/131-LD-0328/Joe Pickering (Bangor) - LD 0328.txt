LD 328
Dear Senator Joseph Baldacci Senate Chair and Michelle Meyer House Chair and 
members of the Health and Human Services Committee: 
I totally support Senator Stewart's LD 328 An Act to improve "Mental Health" in 
Maine. I understand it is a bill to direct DHHS to Maine Care rules (sec. 17) May the 
Health and Human Services Committee please pass it unanimously so that it can have 
the best chance to pass our state legislature.
I was a former Executive Director of a Community Health organization for over 30 
years in Maine. Much more importantly I was the father of my late son Christopher 
Pickering who had a serious brain disorder, (schizophrenia) Living with Chris with 
his severe schizophrenia was a 26 year "education." I learned what certain serious 
brain disorders were and it was well beyond the outdated and discriminatory terms 
"mental illness" and "physical illness."  Our human body is one integrated, interactive
system from head to toe. 
I realize this bill is no longer a "concept bill" but along with passing LD 328, I only 
hope that someone on this committee will at least next year sponsor a bill to evaluate 
and propose changes to the outdated and discriminatory words and terms that our 
society and our federal and state use to wrongly label our various illnesses and 
disorders particularly related to certain serious brain disorders. I have learned from 
working and advocating for over 50 years in three states: Massachusetts, Maine and 
Washington state how the illness or disorder determines how our government funds 
the services and funds the research. This cruel nonsense tragically often leads to 
deaths.  How can Maine make a national and even a international difference?  You 
our Maine Leaders can LIVE OUR STATE MOTTO TO LEAD and be national 
leaders and improve "mental health." by recognizing it is health period!!
