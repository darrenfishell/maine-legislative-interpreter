A TTN:
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
In
Re:
LD
898
"Resolve,
to
Increase
the
Reimbursement
Rate
for
Foster
Parents
by
20
Percent"
Dear
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer
and
the
esteemed
members
of
the
Health
and 
Human
Service
committee,
My
name
is
T ravis
Bryant
and
I
am
responding
in
my
capacity
as
Executive
Director
of 
Adoptive
and
Foster
Families
of
Maine,
Inc.
&
The
Kinship
Program
(AFFM)
to
testify
neither 
for
nor
against
LD
898.
AFFM’ s
mission
is
to
provide
the
training,
guidance,
knowledge,
and
resources
needed
to
handle 
complex
issues
encountered
by
resource
families
as
they
open
their
hearts
and
homes
to
children 
in
need.
AFFM
works
with
a
wide
array
of
resource
families
both
formally
involved
in
the
child 
welfare
system
and
those
not
involved
in
the
child
welfare
system.
AFFM
co-presents
the 
preservice
training
in
order
for
families
to
become
a
licensed
foster
home.
Once
families
are 
licensed
a
peer
support
navigator
from
AFFM
reaches
out
directly
to
licensed
families
to 
congratulate
them
on
their
accomplishment
and
to
remind
them
of
the
supports
that
are
available 
to
them
free
of
char ge.
AFFM
also
reaches
out
to
families
while
they
are
licensed
to
inform
them 
of
family
events,
training
opportunities,
support
groups,
etc.
All
of
the
staf f
at
AFFM
have
lived 
experience
either
as
a
resource
parent,
a
former
youth
in
care,
or
the
child
of
a
resource
parent. 
The
staf f
at
AFFM
provide
non-judgemental
listening
support,
systems
navigation,
resource 
family
education,
referrals,
and
material
goods
that
can
help
meet
a
family's
ur gent
needs
while 
identifying
future
goals
and
how
to
develop
their
own
community
of
supports.
In
2018
the
state
of
Maine
had
increased
the
foster
care
board
rates
to
$25
per
day
per
child
for 
those
children
that
are
evaluated
by
the
levels
of
care
(LOC)
system
as
a
level
“A”.
The
daily 
board
rate
increases
based
on
the
LOC
that
they
received.
There
are
6
levels
of
care
with
the 
highest
level
being
specific
to
children
that
are
considered
medically
fragile.
Anecdotally ,
a 
majority
of
children
are
leveled
at
an
A
($25
per
day)
or
B
($30
per
day)
with
the
next
highest 
population
being
at
a
C
($45)
or
D
($60),
which
is
considered
therapeutic
care.
I
have
included
1
of
2

the
LOC
policy
for
level
A
and
level
D
to
help
provide
high-level
context
to
the
needs
and 
behaviors
that
resource
families
support
24
hours
a
day
7
days
a
week.
The
LOC
policy
states:
LOC
A
-
Basic
Care
-
Minimal
Needs.
This
level
is
for
children
who
have
minimal
needs 
and
require
the
type
of
care
of fered
in
a
family
resource
home
for
children.
"Children 
with
minimal
needs"
may
have
occasional
episodes
of
behavioral
and/or
emotional 
problems
which
do
not
significantly
impair
the
child’ s
interpersonal
relationships
and 
ability
to
function
at
home
or
at
school.
"Children
with
minimal
needs"
are
expected
to 
function
lar gely
at
an
age
appropriate
level
educationally ,
socially ,
physically ,
medically , 
developmentally ,
and
emotionally .
LOC
D
-
T reatment
Care
-
High
Needs.
This
level
is
for
children
who
have
high
needs 
that
require
a
higher
than
LOC
C
–
T reatment
Care
level
of
services
in
a
specialized 
resource
home.
"Children
with
high
needs"
may
display
the
following:
significant 
developmental
delays,
impulsivity
requiring
external
control,
ongoing
conflict
with 
others,
unresponsiveness
to
social
prompts,
need
for
special
education
services
to
address 
performance
and/or
behavior
issues,
slow
or
no
progress
in
mental
health
treatment,
and 
may
require
in-home
supports
for
medical
conditions.
They
may
have
a
history
of 
self-abusive
behaviors,
including
assaults
to
others.
For
more
information
about
the
levels
of
care
can
be
found
using
this
link 
https://www .maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/cw/policy/v_-g-1_-levels-of-care.html
No
matter
the
level
of
care,
the
weight
of
a
child’ s
needs
is
felt
most
by
the
families
who
provide 
24/7
care
to
the
child,
teen
or
young
adult.
Though
some
items
that
are
purchased
for
children 
can
be
reimbursed
by
The
Of fice
of
Child
and
Family
Services,
there
are
other
expenses
that
the 
foster
families
must
cover
out
of
their
own
pockets.
When
a
financial
burden
is
added
to
the 
intricacies
of
caring
for
a
youth
or
young
adult
who
has
a
traumatic
history
due
to
abuse
and 
neglect,
it
can
be
the
tipping
point
of
a
resource
family’ s
overflowing
bucket.
The
Governor ’ s
proposed
budget
makes
a
positive
step
in
the
right
direction
to
help
alleviate
one 
of
the
burdens
faced
by
licensed
resource
families
as
they
seek
to
increase
the
board
rate
by
5%. 
AFFM
also
commends
Representative
Collings
for
bringing
more
attention
to
the
needs
of 
resource
families
and
proposing
a
20%
increase
to
board
rates.
It
is
evident
that
there
is
a
need
to 
have
ongoing
consideration
of
board
rate
increases
based
upon
current
economic
climate
and
the 
acuity
of
care
that
is
needed
for
youth
and
young
adults
in
foster
care,
to
ensure
resource
families 
have
the
financial
support
they
need
to
provide
for
the
youth
in
their
care.
If
you
have
any
question
regarding
my
testimony
or
if
I
can
be
of
service
to
provide
more 
information
at
the
work
session,
I
would
be
happy
to
do
so. 
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
Respectfully
submitted
by:
T ravis

Director 
Adoptive
and
Foster
Families
of
