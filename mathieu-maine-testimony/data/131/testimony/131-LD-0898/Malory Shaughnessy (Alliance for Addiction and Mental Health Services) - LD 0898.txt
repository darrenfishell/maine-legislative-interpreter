Testimony in Support of  LD 898 
"Resolve, to Increase the Reimbursement Rate for Foster Parents by 20 Percent " 
Sponsored by Representative Ben Collings  
March 21, 2023  
 
Good morning  Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and hardworking members of 
the Health and Human Services  Committees.   My name is  Malory Shaughnessy and I am 
the Executive Director of the Alliance for Addicti on and Mental Health Services. The 
Alliance is the statewide association representing the majority of Maine’s community 
based mental health and substance use treatment providers , providing services to over 
80,000 Maine men, women, and children . The Allianc e advocates for the implementation 
of sound policies and evidence -based practices that serve to enhance the quality and 
effectiveness of our behavioral health care system.  
 
On behalf of the Alliance, I am here today to speak in support of LD 898, "Resolve,  to 
Increase the Reimbursement Rate for Foster Parents by 20 Percent.” This resolve directs 
the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to increase the 
reimbursement rates for foster parents for all foster care levels of care by twenty 
percent. Maine needs more foster families. We are all aware  of the financial pressures 
facing all families in Maine and foster families are no exception.  
 
Although this bill focuses on all levels of foster care, I would like to bring special attention 
to the families providing therapeutic foster care. Therapeutic foster care is focused on 
the care of children with developmental, emotional, and/or medical disabilities who are 
in State custody. Families that provide this level of care are trained  by the Offic e of Child 
and Family Services (OCFS) to be Licensed Resource Parents. Foster parents who are 
opening their homes and providing support for these children are a vital part of Maine’s 
child protective network. And, we don’t have enough of them. We need to m ake sure 
these families are well supported.   
 
I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on LD 898. Thank you for your time and attention to this 
important issue. I have included some recent data below and I would be happy to get you 
additional information for the w ork session.  
 
According to the most recent Kids Count report:  
The number of children in the custody of the state of Maine on December 
31,2022 was 2,320 exactly 100 more than the previous year, and 775 
more children than in 2017 and the highest number in state custody since 
2005.  The rate of youth removed from their homes and placed in foster 
care is more than four times as high in some counties compared to 
others. In 2022, 7 of Maine's 16 counties had rates above 10 per 1,000 
children (or more than 1% of  all children.) These counties were: Knox, 
(17.6), Androscoggin, (16.7), Somerset, (15.5), Aroostook, (15.2), 
Kennebec, (13.7), Hancock, (12.0) and Penobscot, (11.1) Meanwhile, two 
counties had rates below 5.0 per 1,000 children, including Waldo (4.0) 
and Lincoln (4.8). 1
