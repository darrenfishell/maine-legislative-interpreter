Memorandum of Support

To: Honorable Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety. 
From: Jonathan Martell 
RE: LD 1103 An Act to Allow Persons Who Lawfully Use or Possess Cannabis to Own or Possess Firearms 
or Ammunition 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1103 An Act to Allow Persons Who Lawfully 
Use or Possess Cannabis to Own or Possess Firearms or Ammunition 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. l am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member. 
This bill simply affirms the Maine Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The Maine Constitution does not 
have qualifiers such as if a person is of a certain race, or social status, or whether they like ice cream or not. 
While I'm not a user of cannabis and related products, l fully support the right of Maine Citizens to keep and bear 
arms without infringement. lt is legal in Maine recreationally, and therefore no Maine laws are being broken by 
use or possession. lt's about time Maine laws aligned with clearly defined rights, and those that use a very 
common substance not be discriminated against. As you are likely aware, there are many that use it for 
medicinal uses to control chronic pain or nausea from cancer treatments. Are these citizens a danger to society 
or themselves? Alcohol is a much larger problem, but that does not prevent anyone from owning a firearm. 
Please support Mainer‘s Constitutional Rights, by supporting this bill. 
Sincerely, 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
