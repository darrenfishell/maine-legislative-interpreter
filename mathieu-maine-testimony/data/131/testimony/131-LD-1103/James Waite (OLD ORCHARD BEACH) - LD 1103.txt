LD 1103
I'm writing in support of LD 1103, "An Act to Allow Persons Who Lawfully Use or 
Possess Cannabis to Own or Possess Firearms or Ammunition."
This bill exempts persons who use or possess cannabis pursuant to the Cannabis  
Legalization Act or the Maine Medical Use of Cannabis Act from the prohibition on 
the possession of a firearm provided in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 
393. It prohibits a state employee or municipal official from assisting a federal agency
or federal official with locating, apprehending, arresting or charging a person alleged 
to have violated 18 United States Code, Section 922(g)(3) because the person 
possesses or uses cannabis pursuant to Title 22, chapter 558-C or Title 28-B.
I don't think legalizing Cannabis for recreational use was a good idea, but here we are.
I have read this bill in its entirety and  I urge the committee to vote "Ought to Pass" 
on LD 1103.
Sincerely, James M Waite
