THE MAINE SENATE 
13 lst Legislature 
Testimony of Senator Richard A. Bennett 
In Support of LD 233, "An Act to Ensure Efficiency in Petitions Reviewed by the Secretary of 
State by Clarifying Deadlines Related to Those Petitions" 
6 February 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Committee on Veterans and Legal 
Affairs, I am Senator Rick Bennett of Oxford, and I have the honor of serving 14 communities in 
Western Maine in the State Senate. I am pleased to cosponsor LD 233, An Act to Ensure 
Efficiency in Petitions Reviewed by the Secretary of State by Clarifying Deadlines Related to 
Those Petitions. 
This legislation is an election integrity bill that also preserves the constitutionally-protected 
citizen initiative process. In simple terms, it gives the Secretary of State more time to validate 
signatures, which is a large undertaking that usually happens around election time, when the 
Secretary of State’s ofﬁce is busiest. While the staff has managed to validate signatures in the 
past, it has caused a great deal of stress and forced staff to work countless hours of overtime. 
Depending on the number of initiatives, signature validation can be a huge undertaking. 
The citizen initiative process is an important tool for the Maine people to have their voices heard. 
Allowing the Secretary of State’s ofﬁce more time to validate signatures will not take away from 
this process, but will allow the ofﬁce the necessary time to do the work without overwhelming 
staff. 
Thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions.
