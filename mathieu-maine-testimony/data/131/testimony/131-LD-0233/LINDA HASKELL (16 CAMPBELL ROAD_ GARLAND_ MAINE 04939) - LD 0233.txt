LD233 HP0154 An Act to Ensure Efficiency in Petitions Reviewed by the Secretary 
of State by Clarifying Deadlines Related to these Petitions 
Opposed  LINDA P HASKELL GARLAND, MAINE
 The wording in the original bill law was acceptable as read and understood. The 
office is reaching a little further than necessary. Why are we the People allowing an 
officer of the people to push up dates to benefit themselves. The residents of Maine 
need their space for survival and work and family. The office of Secretary of State has
plenty of people to do this work. NO! This should not be passed.
