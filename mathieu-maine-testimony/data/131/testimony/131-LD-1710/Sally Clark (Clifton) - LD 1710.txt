LD 1710
I oppose LD 1710 because private citizens should not be mandated to enter into a 
contract with the government. We are a private citizen with a private business. If we 
choose not to participate in a program that is our god given right as a free citizen. In 
no way shape or form should the government determine how much income I can 
make or spend this is a free country.
