Amanda  Scrivani
Portland
LD 1710
Hello,
My name is Amanda Scrivani, I am a small housing provider in Portland, Maine. I am
fortunate to have the opportunity to provide a safe, stable, and affordable place to live 
for several families in the Greater Portland area. I strongly oppose LD 1710. This bill 
will not solve our housing crisis, it will make it worse. Small landlords are not 
equipped to handle this type of government intervention on private contracts between 
individuals. We will be forced to either charge tenants huge administrative and 
attorney fees or sell our properties, paving the way for large out of state corporations 
that will treat tenants as numbers instead of humans.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
