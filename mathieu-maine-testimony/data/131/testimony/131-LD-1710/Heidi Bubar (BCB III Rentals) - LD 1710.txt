LD 1710
I oppose LD1710.  LD 1710 raises serious concerns regarding property rights and the 
potential infringement on the freedom of choice for property owners and investors. 
The proposal seems to pave the way for a disturbing trend where private citizens are 
compelled to sign contracts with government entities or face punitive actions from the
Maine Human Rights Commission. Such a measure undermines the principles of 
personal liberty and limited government interference.
In the midst of a housing crisis, it is crucial to incentivize and support individuals who
are willing to provide rental housing options. By imposing additional regulations and 
burdensome requirements, LD 1710 risks discouraging potential landlords from 
entering the market and increasing the number of available rental units. This could 
exacerbate the already dire housing shortage, making it even more challenging for 
individuals, especially low-income tenants, to find suitable accommodations.
One of the most concerning aspects of LD 1710 is the burden it places on landlords. 
The proposal suggests that landlords must track monthly income and utility expenses 
for each tenant to determine when the rent becomes unaffordable. However, this 
requirement fails to consider the practical challenges associated with obtaining this 
data, especially if tenants are unwilling to provide it. Implementing such a law would 
impose an unnecessary administrative burden on landlords and potentially discourage 
them from renting to low-income tenants due to the increased paperwork and 
reporting involved.
While it is important to protect tenants from unaffordable housing, LD 1710 appears 
to be an overly intrusive and impractical solution. Instead of burdening landlords, 
policymakers should focus on creating an environment that encourages investment in 
affordable housing and promotes collaboration between landlords and tenants. This 
could involve exploring alternative solutions such as providing incentives for 
landlords to offer affordable housing options or implementing programs that assist 
tenants in securing suitable housing without placing excessive demands on property 
owners.
In conclusion, LD 1710 is detrimental to property rights, discourages individuals from
offering rental housing, and burdens landlords with onerous requirements. Rather than
resorting to heavy-handed regulations that could hinder the rental market, it is 
imperative for lawmakers to pursue solutions that strike a balance between tenant 
protection and property owner rights. By fostering an environment that encourages 
investment and collaboration, we can address the housing crisis while respecting the 
freedoms and choices of all parties involved.
