LD 1710
Honorable Committee on Housing,
We write in support of of LD-1710, The Home Act. 
Soaring rents have placed an intolerable burden on many of our fellow Mainers.  
There is a undeniable need for immediate material relief.
The people facing the worst impacts of the housing crisis, people who are working for
low wages or are on small fixed incomes are the most vulnerable. They cannot afford 
to wait for market resolutions. And we must not ignore the financial, physical, mental,
social and economic suffering imposed on our family, friends and neighbors who are 
being harmed by these intolerable circumstances.
The virtue of LD 1710 is that not only will it create housing stability for thousands of 
Mainers in the near term, it will have enduring positive effects on  Maine individuals, 
families, and communities.
This important bill provides rental assistance, with appropriately targeted funding 
sources. It's aim of increasing the supply of affordable rental units, and ending 
discrimination against rental assistance is critical at this time.
Please support LD-1710. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Christopher N. McKinnon
