LD 1710
I am strongly opposed to LD 1710. Attempting to for 10% of an owner's private rental
units into some version of low income housing is legally questionable, logistically 
unenforceable, and simply the wrong way to engage housing providers in the 
solutions to our housing challenge. 
Rent Control in Portland has been a failure and the cause of more rental increases in 
Portland since before its passage. I never raised rents in my units before rent control. 
Unfortunately, I am now forced to raise every unit every year because of rent control 
restrictions.  
You should expect LD 1710 would have a similar effect. If 10% of units are forced to 
be below market rate, then the other 90% will be higher than they are today to 
compensate. 
A proposal this dramatic should:
a) be rejected out of hand on the grounds of basic property rights
b) considered much more thoroughly both in terms of consequences and legality
c) considered in the context of the ultimate need for more housing development - this 
type of restriction will discourage more housing development, which is the thing we 
need most. 
I have been the President of the Southern Maine Landlord Association (now the 
Rental Housing Alliance) for more than 15 years, representing hundreds of rental 
housing providers and 100's of units during that time. I am also a founding member of
the Quality Housing Coalition (QHC), which engages landlords to voluntarily accept 
at-risk tenants through our Project HOME program. In 2022, we housed 250 families 
in private, market rate units. 
This type of solution is both positive and effective. Maine has good rental housing 
providers - treating them that way will get more good housing providers and more 
good housing; treating them like they are the problem will get more housing 
problems.
