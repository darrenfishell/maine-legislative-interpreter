 Hello Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and members of the Special Committee on 
Housing, 
My name is Taylor Cray, and I am the Outreach Team Leader for Preble Street’s Advocacy 
Team. I am here today to testify in support of LD 1710: An Act to Establish the Maine 
Rental Assistance and Guarantee Program and Amend the Laws Regarding Tenants and 
the Municipal General Assistance Program. 
Throughout the day, you will hear testimony from a variety of individuals, each with their 
own experiences and stories regarding the necessity of this bill, and for good reason. The 
HOME Act provides the people of the State of Maine with housing stability at a time when 
the cost of living is becoming steadily more unaffordable. Crushing poverty, looming 
threats of eviction, and inconsistent food access exacerbate existing distress for Maine 
families and individuals, forcing them to make impossible decisions to support their 
households. 
At Preble Street, we work tirelessly alongside dedicated community partners and allies to 
help keep folks safe and healthy. Housing, shelter, and food security are essential for 
Mainers to lead healthy lives and escape the cycles of poverty that keep many families 
trapped for generations. While no singular policy can address all these issues, the HOME 
Act is a bold and powerful proposal built on the knowledge and experience of Mainers. 
The HOME Act addresses some of the most prominent fears that permeate the minds of 
Maine renters. As I am sure you know, many of our most persistent housing issues are the 
result of past policies that have favored the interests of businesses, corporate landlords, 
and others who are able to pour money into influencing policymaking. These policies 
have impacted Mainers living in poverty, New Mainers, and Mainers of color at 
disproportionate rates, furthering existing stigmas and socioeconomic divides. 
The City of Portland is currently engaging in a difficult discussion surrounding an 
encampment of unhoused individuals living on the Bayside Trail. This past Tuesday, the 
City of Portland decided to move the encampment despite desperate pleas from 
advocates, community partners, and impacted individuals. These individuals truly have 
nowhere else to go. There is no available shelter or housing, and the City’s encampment 
policy continues to limit the areas where individuals are permitted to camp. South 
Portland hotels, which have been sheltering unhoused individuals for many months, have 
now closed, leaving these folks with no options. Case workers and individuals work hard 
to secure housing vouchers, only to have applications rejected time and time again. 
Housing costs are rising, evictions are ongoing, and the cost of living continues to creep 
upward. The HOME Act can help prevent individuals from reaching similar points of crisis.

 We have the power to make changes to the laws and policies that have allowed the 
housing and shelter crisis to become so desperate. Prohibiting discrimination against 
individuals with housing vouchers will help families and individuals find safe and stable 
housing in neighborhoods of their choosing. Changes to the Real Estate Tax Credit will 
help to fund a deeply necessary rental assistance program, keeping Mainers in their 
homes at a time when losing housing can mean remaining without housing and shelter 
for extended periods of time. Consumer protections for renters will prevent individuals in 
poverty from being further penalized by lower credit scores and higher eviction records. 
Each of these policy changes will help to ease the desperation, chronic poverty, and deep 
psychological distress that is felt by thousands of Mainers each day. The widespread 
dedication and support today is proof of the deep-seated need for these policy changes. 
Please pass the HOME Act and support Mainers as we support one another. 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely, 
Taylor Cray
