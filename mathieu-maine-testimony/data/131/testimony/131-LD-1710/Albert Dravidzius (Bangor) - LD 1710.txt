LD 1710
RE:  LD 1710
I oppose LD 1710 for the following reasons:
Section 3
I am on Social Security.  I have a rental unit that supplements my income. I do not 
believe the government should be in the rental business.  
Section 4
My rental unit is affordable and, under your “rules,” it would not be for many renters. 
Why is the government going into Small Businesses?
Section 5
The government cannot control its trillion-dollar budget.  Why would anyone want a 
contract with a government that cannot control its contractual obligations?  NO 
contract with the government.
Finally
There is too much overreach by government; both State and Federal. 
Leave Small Businesses to make their own decisions.
