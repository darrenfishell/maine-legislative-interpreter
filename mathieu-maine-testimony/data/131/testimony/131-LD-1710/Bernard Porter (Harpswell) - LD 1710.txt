I oppose LD 1710
These proposed restrictions will discourage development of affordable housing. 
Housing is very expensive in anyone’s budget and it’s particularly expensive to create
for others.
I believe a better use of time would be working on zoning regulations to encourage 
development as opposed to restricting it.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
