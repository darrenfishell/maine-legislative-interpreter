LD 1710
To the Housing Committee,
I am writing to oppose LD 1710.  For the past ten years I have held the office of 
secretary for the Greater Bangor Apartment and Managers Association (GBAOMA).  
We are an organization with a little under 600 memberships.  I have seen the climate 
change over the past ten years to how landlords are viewed.  Legislative bills 
attacking landlords and their ability to run their business have been brutal this year.   
Never before have I heard so many of our members talking about selling their units.  
Those who have already sold are joyful that they are no longer landlords!  Too many 
are fearful of the impact some of these bills will have on their ability to cover their 
expenses and provide for their families.   I urge you to consider the downside of over 
regulation.  I am sure the last thing you want to do during a housing crisis  is 
discourage those who providing housing.
