Senator Pierce, Representative Geere, and distinguished members of the Special 
Committee on Housing,
My name is Jordan Henry and I am a resident of Old Town, ME and work at a nearby 
school as a social worker and I am testifying in favor of LD 1710. 
Rental assistance will make it so parents and guardians can buy snacks for their 
children to take to school. Moreover, it means children will experience a reduction in 
disruptive behaviors and be more likely to be present and engaged in school. It means 
being able to afford warm, winter clothes. It means a family can pay to get their car 
fixed and provide transportation for their child for after school sports and clubs. It 
means a child on MaineCare receiving outpatient counseling at school is less at risk of
relocating thus needing to establish a new therapeutic relationship. A 3rd grader once 
told me he didn’t plan on making friends at his new school because they would just 
end up moving again. 
I know this because I spend dozens of hours every week listening to children, parents 
and kinship caregivers describe their lives and the many challenges they are up 
against. Most of the time, these issues overlap with or stem from factors related to 
unstable housing and the problems it exacerbates. 
There is no reason why we should not raise the Real Estate Transfer Tax and fund a 
voucher program that will uplift the lives of thousands of people— our neighbors, our
children’s friends at school as well as their teachers, and so many others who we 
know. I recently purchased a home and know that raising the RETT will not 
dramatically change the lives of home buyers. It didn’t change mine.. However, it will
dramatically change the lives of countless others across our state. 
Pass the HOME Act and create the change that our housing landscape in Maine so 
desperately needs. 
With Urgency,
Jordan Henry
