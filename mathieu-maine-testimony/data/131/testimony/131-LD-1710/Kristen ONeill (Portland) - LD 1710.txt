LD 1710
Hello,
I oppose LD1710.
I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter and consider my perspective on this 
complicated issue.
My husband and I are owners of a three unit building here in Portland and we self 
manage. We owner occupy one, my father lives in the other and we have a father and 
his two children in the third.
I have concerns with LD1710 and how that would affect our ability to function as a 
small business. As a full time mother, this is how we subsidize my ability to stay 
home and be with our daughter. The income we generate from our building helps us 
provide for our child and family. It’s not a lot but it helps. We are real people trying 
to do our best.
We recognize there is an affordable housing issue but please don’t rush to legislation 
that will hurt small landlords and make it easier for big companies to come in and buy
up all the housing. If you make it to hard for families like ours to operate that is what 
will happen because we won’t be able to stay in this business.
We love our building and the community we have within it. We take pride in offering 
quality housing. Let’s work together to find solutions that will help everyone.
