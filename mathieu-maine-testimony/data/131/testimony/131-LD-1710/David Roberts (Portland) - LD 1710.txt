LD 1710
Good evening,
My name is David Roberts and I provide rental housing options in Portland and South
Portland. I'm hoping you'll reconsider LD 1710. This bill is not the way to solve the 
housing crisis and will cause the small housing providers, like myself, to be forced to 
sell their homes and make way for larger corporations. The rules that it will put in 
place about providing low-income housing for 10% of your units once you reach 10 
or more units owned would substantially increase my operating costs, leading to 
property (and tenant) turnover.
I feel strongly that this recent onslaught of bills against housing providers, in this case
LD 1710, is not the way to accomplish our common goal of housing stability. I would
encourage you to vote "no" on this bill tomorrow.
Thank you,
David
