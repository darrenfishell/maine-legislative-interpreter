I am increasingly aware of the challenges that people face trying to find affordable 
housing in Maine, and housing is a human right. I believe that LD 1710 will work to 
solve some of the intractable problems around high rents and lack of financial support
for our less fortunate Maine residents and strongly support its passage. Thanks for 
your consideration. Let's be a leader in our thoughtful and inclusive housing policies.
