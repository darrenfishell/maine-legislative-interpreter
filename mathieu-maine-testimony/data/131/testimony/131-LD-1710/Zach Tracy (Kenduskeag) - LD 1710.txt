LD 1710
I oppose LD 1710 because this bill (section 4) would require landlords to provide at 
least 10% of units available for rent to qualify as affordable housing if they own more
than ten units. Forcing business owners to make any type of service or product 
affordable by government mandate will only mean that the associated cost to he 
business will be pushed to consumers in other ways. In the case a rental property 
business, the consumer is the tenant. These cost will be pushed to tenant by increased 
rents. If rent increases are then restricted, application fees will increase. If application 
fees are restricted (Bangor for example), than a service fee will be added to every 
financial transaction tenants make. There are other ways business could legally avoid 
the impacts of this section just by structuring their rental portfolio through a series of 
legal entities. If you want to lower rents, you need to reduce legislation. Compliance 
is costly to businesses, and the expenses to stay compliant will ALWAYS be pushed 
to the consumer, regardless of industry.
