LD 1710
Dear Senator Pierce and members of the Housing Committee,
I have been a landlord for over 30 years and I strongly oppose LD1710. There is a 
need for more housing but to put this burden on the people who provide housing will 
not only put excess burden on us, but also to our market rate tenants. 
I seldom increased rent on my tenants but because of rent control in Portland I am 
forced to increase every year.   My rents were lower than the market on many of my 
units and when rent control happened I was stuck  without the ability to increase to 
market rate when I have a turnover.    I learned that I had to increase my rents in other
areas in case they also  decide to have rent control.  
Government can just raise taxes to help citizens that require rental assistance but what
are landlords to do?  We are not all  large corporate rental  companies, we are small 
time landlords, and have expenses and yes, we  are due a little profit for our sacrifices 
and hard work.
Thank you for consideration in opposing LD1710.
