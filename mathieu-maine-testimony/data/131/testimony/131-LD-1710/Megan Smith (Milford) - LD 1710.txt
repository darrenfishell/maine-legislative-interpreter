Senator Pierce, Representative. Gere, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Housing. My name is Megan Smith, I live in Milford, and I am 
here to testify in favor of LD 1710. 
I believe that housing is a human right and that it is the responsibility of our 
elected officials to make sure that Maine families and individuals can afford 
to live in the state. 
Maine’s rental housing market is one of the least affordable in the country. 
This is no longerjust a Southern Maine issue as prices have significantly 
increased in every county across the state. Because it is more common for 
low-income Mainers to rent than own, rising rental costs are creating a 
hardship for families and individuals that have the least resources. 
Many years ago, I was a young single mother who faced the struggle of 
finding affordable housing for myself and my daughter. It is from this 
experience that I know what it is like to live in fear of not being able to 
afford next month’s rent. I remember the constant anxiety of deciding which 
bills I could skip for the month, or whether I ate dinner each night, to make 
sure that I could pay my rent on time. The many years that I faced housing 
insecurity created a tremendous strain on both my “mental and physical 
health and I would not wish that experience on anyone. 
Today there is a housing shortage that has taken many years to get to the 
crisis that we are experiencing today. The pandemic helped to shinea 
spotlight on the issue of housing insecurity in Maine. When Maine families, 
especially those with limited resources, have access to safe and affordable 
housing it benefits all communities by building our workforce, strengthening 
our schools, and providing opportunities that -power our local economy. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak in front of this committee today and 
am urging you to support LD1710 
Thank. You, 
Megan Smith
