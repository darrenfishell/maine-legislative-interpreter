Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
members
of
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing
My
name
is
Raychel
Ward
and
I
am
from
Livermore
falls
Maine.
I
regret
that
I
could
not
testify
in
person.
As
you
know
today
was
Head
Start
Goes
to
Augusta.
Just
last
year
after
Headstart
Goes
to
Augusta
I
was
rushing
home
to
meet
with
a
news
reporter.
I
was
meeting
with
this
reporter
due
to
the
unaffordable
sub
par
housing
I
was
living
in
in
Lewiston
Maine
at
the
time.
I
do
not
envy
any
of
you
sitting
on
this
committee
today.
Housing
is
a
complex
issue
and
can
be
a
hard
one
to
navigate
as
a
tenant,
landlord
or
legislature.
So
instead
of
asking
you
to
do
one
thing
or
another
I
may
ask
you
to
do
this,
travel
our
fine
state
and
take
note
of
the
crisis
you
see
around
you.
Be
aware
of
the
unhoused
population
and
question
how
did
we
get
here?
Just
last
year
I
was
living
in
an
apartment
with
mice,
bugs
and
mold
and
could
get
no
help
despite
paying
almost
my
whole
family's
income
in
rent
for
a
3
bedroom
inner
city
apartment.
I
had
made
calls
to
the
property
management
company
that
took
over
after
our
building
sold
and
continuously
raised
the
rent
despite
making
no
repairs.
I
recall
June
9th
of
2022
we
were
leaving
for
a
little
league
game
and
the
inside
of
my
fridge
was
warm.
This
was
a
saturday.
I
called
after
hours
maintenance
to
be
told
and
I
quote
“I
don't
have
a
refrigerator
shoved
up
my
ass”
from
the
maintenance
at
Central
Maine
Property
management.
Despite
paying
$1600
a
month
for
rent
and
living
off
what
little
SNAP
benefits
we
had
we
now
had
no
way
to
store
milk
for
my
children,
or
food
in
general
and
had
to
buy
meal
by
meal
adding
to
our
financial
woes.
This
continued
until
November
when
we
could
finally
afford
to
move
out
of
the
apartment
and
into
the
home
we
live
in
now.
In
regards
to
LD1710
I
think
you
need
to
think
carefully
about
what
this
bill
is
asking
for.
We
are
asking
that
property
owners
no
longer
be
able
to
discriminate
against
those
receiving
assistance.
We
are
asking
that
they
make
housing
available
and
accessible.
We
are
asking
that
housing
no
longer
be
in
disrepair.
We
are
asking
that
you
take
into
consideration
the
soaring
costs
of
rent
that
will
continue
to
go
higher
under
the
guise
of
“Market
rate”
when
housing
vouchers
are
not
updated
nearly
as
often
as
rental
price
increases.
We
are
asking
that
you
understand
not
all
of
us
are
out
of
the
workforce
and
often
cannot
be
available
to
reapply
monthly
for
help
we
so
desperately
need.
We
are
asking
that
debts
not
be
sent
to
collections
because
of
an
inability
to
pay
for
the
most
basic
of
needs.
I
know
this
is
a
tall
order
and
I
know
you
feel
that
you're
damned
if
you
do
and
damned
if
you
don’t
but
please
I
urge
you
to
vote
ought
to
pass
on
LD1710.
