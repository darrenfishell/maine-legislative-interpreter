Ned Payne
Westbrook, Maine
LD 1710
My name is Ned Payne and I provide housing to roughly 250 low and moderate 
income individuals in Portland.  I'm writing in opposition to LD 1710.
This bill is incredibly complex and only makes it harder and less attractive for 
landlords to provide housing, let alone build new units.  I recognize there is a lot of 
pressure on the legislature to do something about housing, but the policies that get 
passed need to INCENTIVISE the preservation and creation of more low to moderate 
income housing units.
I originally got into housing very excited about trying to own and develop mid range 
housing in Maine.  The city of Portland and now the state of Maine policies are 
making it less and less attractive.  We need policies that incentivize the creation of 
more low to moderate income housing.  Nobody is going to want to own or build 
more housing if laws like this continue to be considered, let alone passed.
