LD 1710
I oppose LD170.
I have been a small landlord in Portland for 40 years.  I have always kept clean, safe, 
affordable units.  LD170 creates an overwhelming, daunting view of my future as a 
housing provider.  I read through it (as best I could) and if this passes I will sell my 
buildings, probably as condos, or have vacant apartments.  It is literally beyond 
comprehension for your average landlord to fully grasp all of the demands this 
proposes. You would certainly be providing lots of work for lawyers and judges if this
were to pass.
