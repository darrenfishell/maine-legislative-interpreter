Testimony in support of LD 1710 
Joaquina Nunes 
12 May 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and honorable members of the Housing Committee: 
my name is Joaquina Nunes, I live in Portland Maine. I am here today to testify in favor 
of LD 1710. 
I’m a case manager and interpreter, I have big love for working in the community. 
Everyday I experience the struggle of ﬁnding housing for residents in Maine. I am no 
exception within the residents of greater Portland who pay more than 52% of our income 
in rent. I have a goal of going back to school but this is has become an impossible 
mission for me because I have a very expensive rent that make me Work very long hours 
leaving me no extra time to pursue my goal and better my skills for a better and higher 
level job, surely ensure me a better future for me and my family. I feel stuck and I always 
think “just if I could pay less for my expenses I could be able to create my own steps and 
climb up these stairs” and better myself, and people around me. 
The Home Act is What we need, I am not standing here alone all of us have been affected 
by this issue and perhaps you or your families members also have been affected by this 
housing crisis we can not allow this to continue, let's all stand together so that our 
residents can have a place to call Home. 
Thank you all very much, 
Sincerely, 
Joaquina Nunes
