Ashley Salisbury
Portland
LD 1710
My name is Ashley Salisbury, I am a landlord renting fewer than 10 apartments in 
Portland.
I oppose LD 1710 for several reasons:
1.  Principally, this legislation will not achieve its goal of providing what we really 
need--more affordable housing for Mainers.  This problem can only be solved by 
building more affordable housing.  You can artificially reduce the price of bread, but 
if there aren't enough loaves too many people still go hungry.  Why aren't we devoting
more resources to zoning, funding, and building affordable housing?
2.  The proposal is unlikely to survive legal challenges, as the requirement for 
landlords to sign contracts with the state are adhesion contracts and this is definitely 
not a precedent that the State wants to set--to require private parties to submit to 
contracts with the government absent the ability to negotiate.
3.  This proposal is likely to have the opposite effect of its intention:  landlords will 
only rent to those with higher incomes, and no new housing will be built because 
there is no possibility of recouping the escalating costs of labor and materials.
Sincerely,
Ashley Salisbury
