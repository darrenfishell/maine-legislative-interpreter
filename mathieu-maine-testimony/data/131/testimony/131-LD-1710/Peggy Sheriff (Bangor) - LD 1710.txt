and Amend the Laws Regarding Tenants and the Municipal General Assistance Program 
 
I oppose LD 1710 for the following reasons: 
 
Section 3 
 
My husband and I are in our 70’s and are on Social Security.  We have several rental units in 
Bangor to help supplement our income.  We do not want to be “forced” to enter into a contract 
with the Government.  The government already controls our income via Social Security. As 
small business owners, we should be able to decide how to run our business within the United 
States laws, which we now do and have always done. 
 
Section 4 
 
 All of our units are “affordable” housing.  We have renters that are like us, on Social Security or 
other fixed incomes.  We also have renters that work and make the minimum wage.  If our units 
were not affordable (as with any rental property owner), we would have many vacancies.  
Landlords are small businesses and we want to have tenants in our units.  If we price our units 
too high, they would always be empty and we would not receive any income, which defeats the 
purpose of having a business. 
 
Section 5 
 
A tenant should not enter into a contract with a landlord if the tenant cannot afford the rent.  This 
is a decision the tenant and landlord would make – not the government.   
 
Summary 
 
Do you impose all the same rules on hotels such as the Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Best Western, 
Wyndham, etc.?  Do you tell these hotels what they can charge for occupancy?  Do you demand 
that they sign a contract with the government to rent their units?  Do you make them charge only 
what a person can pay?  Why are you trying to force smaller businesses to solve the housing 
problems of the State of Maine?   
 
Respectfully submitted,
