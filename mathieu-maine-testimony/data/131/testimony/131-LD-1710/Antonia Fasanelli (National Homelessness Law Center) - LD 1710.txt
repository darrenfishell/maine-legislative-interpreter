Testimony on behalf of National Homelessness Law Center in Support  of LD 1710, An 
Act to Establish the Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee  
Program and Amend the Laws Regarding Tenants and the  
Municipal General Assistance Program  
May 12, 2023 
 
The National Homelessness Law Center (“Law Center”) is pleased to submit the following 
testimony in support  of Bill LD 1710, particularly the provisions amending the Maine 
Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination in housing based on source of income when that 
income is a federal, state or local tenant -based rental assistance program.  
 The mission of the Law Center is to f earlessly advance federal, state and local policies to 
prevent and end homelessness while fiercely defending the rights of al l unhoused persons.  
The Law Center envisions a society where every person can live with dignity and enjoy their basic human rights, including the right to affordable, quality, and safe housing.  The Law Center drives and support s federal, state, and local  policies that will prevent and end 
homelessness , such as LD 1710. 
 
History of Source of Income Non -discrimination Laws  
 
 “Source of income discrimination” refers to the practice of refusing to rent to a housing applicant because of that person’s lawful form of income. Most commonly, this form of discrimination is levied against households using Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs , also  
known as Section 8 vouchers) and other forms of government -funded housing assistance.
1 
Source of income (SOI) discrimination can serve as a pretext for other prohibited form s of 
discrimination and disproportionately affects renters of color, women, and persons with 
disabilities.2 
 To address these challenges, state and local legislators began prohibiting SOI discrimination through state and local fair housing laws beginning in the 1970s, steadily spreading across the country, and increasing exponentially beginning in the mid- 2000s.
3 Today, SOI laws 
protecting families with vouchers cover 18 states and over 100 local municipalities, 
protecting over half of all U.S. families with vouchers.4

Lack of SOI protection can lead to dire outcomes. Voucher holders who are lucky enough to 
find landlords to accept their vouchers in non- SOI protected areas are more likely to live in 
impoverished and racially segregated neighborhoods than non- voucher renters.5 This 
segregation restrains positive health outcomes for low -income women,6 educational 
progress for children, and employment  opportunities  that come from relocation to lower 
poverty and racially segregated communi ties.7 Conversely, jurisdictions with SOI 
protection, have seen deconcentrations  of poverty, as the attached map of Montgomery 
County, Maryland – one of the wealthiest counties in the Country – demonstrates.8      
 
For families unable to use their vouche rs, SOI discrimination contributes to food insecurity, 
domestic violence, child separations and – most significantly – homelessness.   As the largest 
rental housing subsidy program in the country, 9 the HCVP program is the federal 
government’s primary tool to ending homelessness.10  Nevertheless, families wait  – often  
years  – for their name to come to the top of the waiting list and the must find an available 
unit within a limited amount of time.11 A recent Denver study found only 44% of unhouse d 
people surveyed had ever personally, or known anyone personally, who has found housing with a voucher , citing landlord discrimination as a primary reason why.
12 To be clear: the 
lack of SOI protection across the country, including in Maine, prolongs home lessness. 
 In 2017, the American Bar Association adopted a Resolution and Report urging all governments to prohibit discrimination based on source of income.

HCVP vouchers designated for military veterans through the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Voucher Program, known as HUD- VASH, have housed over 144,000 previously 
unhoused veterans since 2008.
15 Yet, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) reports that landlord unwillingness to accept vouchers is a “primary challenge” in the 
administration of the program.16   
 
Fair Housing Laws Prohibiting Source of Income Discrimination Improve Operations 
of the HCVP Prog ram 
 
Discrimination against voucher holders hinders the effectiveness of the HCVP program, not 
just for the families attempting to use the program, but for the public housing agencies operating the programs.  Public housing agencies in jurisdictions with l aws banning source 
of income discrimination report improved utilization rates
17 of 5 to 12 percentage points 
higher than jurisdictions without source of income discrimination.18   
 
Furthermore, research shows that voucher holders are more likely to be able  to use their 
vouchers in jurisdictions with SOI protections.19  The rate at which voucher holders actually 
lease- up using their vouchers is called a “success rate.” “Low success rates are frustrating for 
families and burdensome for PHAs, which typically m ake an unused voucher available to 
another family.”20  
 
In 2021, HUD released “success rate” dat a for two -thirds of the Public Housing Agencies 
(PHAs) in the country based on 2018 and 2019 data.21  The national average success rate 
across these PHAs, in jurisdictions  with and without SOI protection, was 61%  over a 
maximum 180- day lease- up period.22  Though the HUD data has not officially been cross -
analyzed with SOI protected jurisdictions, a hand- calculated analysis of the success rate

In conclusion, housing is a basic life necessity  and human right;23 SOI protections are an 
essential step toward realizing that right for Maine’s res idents. SOI laws improve PHA 
operations, deconcentrate poverty and help end homelessness .  With a negligible cost to 
implementation, SOI laws are one of the most cost- effective tools to alleviate poverty and 
homelessness.  For all these reasons, the National Homelessness Law Center urges passage of 
LD 1710.  Thank you for considering this testimony.

AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION  
 
ADOPTED BY THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES  
AUGUST 14 -15, 2017  
RESOLUTION  
 
RESOLVED, That the American Bar Association urges federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial 
governments to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination in housing on the basis  of lawful 
source of income.   

119A  
REPORT  
The American Bar Association has a long tradition of actively opposing discrimination on the 
basis of classifications including race, gender, nation al origin, disability, age, sexual orientation , 
and gender identity and expression . The Association has adopted policies calling upon local, 
state, and federal lawmakers to prohibit suc h discrimination in housing, as well as in public 
accommodations, credit, education, and public funding and has sought to eliminate such 
discrimination in all aspects of the legal profession.1 The ABA’s fundamental position 
condemning such discrimination is based on its underlying commitment to the ideal of equal 
opportunity  and advancement of human rights.2   These two pr inciples united in August 2013, 
when the ABA adopted policy to urge governments to “promote the human right to adequate 
housing for all” and to “prevent infringement of that right.”3  
 
A common form of discrimination  in housing is the denial of  housing  based on a housing 
applicant’s lawful source of income.  As a threshold matter, lawful source of income includes 
income from: 1) a lawful profession, occupation or job; 2) any government or private assistance, 
grant, loan or rental assistance program, inc luding low -income housing assistance certificates 
and vouchers issued under the United States Housing Act of 1937; 3) a gift, an inheritance, a 
pension, an annuity, alimony, child support, or other consideration or benefit; or 4) the sale or 
pledge of prop erty or an interest in property.  Lawful source of income does not prevent a 
property owner from determining, in a commercially reasonable and non -discriminatory manner, 
the ability of a housing applicant to afford to purchase or rent the property . 
 
Every year, families are rejected from housing of their choice because their income, albeit lawful 
and sufficient in amount, is not accepted by a property owner.  Often the denial of housing will 
serve as a pretext for a prohibited form of discrimination.  For e xample, a property owner who 
does not want to rent to elderly persons will simply deny a housing application claiming that 
retirement benefits are not a sufficient source of income.  A property owner who does not wish to 
rent to persons with disabilities w ill tell an applicant on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that 
government benefits are not an acceptable source of income.    
 
The most common form of source of income discrimination is the denial of housing to families 
who rely on government -funded renta l assistance, such as the federally -funded Housing Choice 
Voucher Program.

 The Housing Choice Voucher Program  
 
The Hous ing Choice Voucher Program  (HCVP) , also known as “Section 8 ,” is the largest 
subsidized housing program in the United States.4  The HCVP provides participating low-income 
families with a housing subsidy that covers a  percentage of private market housing costs.5  The 
HCVP serves elderly persons, persons with disabilities, veterans,6 families and other vulnerable 
populations through eight popula tion-specific sub -programs7 and is administered locally by 
Public Housing Agencies (PHA) . In 2015, the Program served approximately 2.2 million 
families  comprised of 5 million people .8  
 
Low-income h ouseholds wait years to receive HCVP vouchers ,9 but not  every voucher 
household succeeds in finding a housing unit .10  Those who receive vouchers  typically must find 
a housing unit and a landlord willing to accept the voucher within two months.11  This search can 
prove to be prohibitive for many househ olds.   
 
Discrimination against Voucher Holders  
 
A 2001 national study on voucher usage found that households had less than a 50% chance to 
use their vouchers  in some jurisdictions .12 Furthermore, despite the HCVP ’s stated goal to enable 
low-income families  to relocate to communities of lower poverty or minority concentration,13 a 
recent study of voucher holders found that 41% are more likely to live in more impoverished and 
more racially segregated neighborhoods than non -voucher renters.14 This segregation of voucher 
holders restrains positive health outcomes for low -income women,15 educational progress for

has provided vouchers and supportive services to 79,000 veterans since 2008 and is the primary reason that the 
United States has reduced veteran homelessness t o just over 47,000 veterans, a 35% decline since 2009.  See

 children, and employment achievements that come from relocation to lower poverty and racially 
segregated communities.16  
 
A primary cause of this segregation  is landlord discrimination against  voucher holders .  A 2002 
Chicago study found that voucher holders were denied access to 70% of the rental housing in the 
City because of landlord refusal or equivocation to accept househ olds with vouchers .17 A recent 
HCVP participant summarized her experience as follows, “They [the owners] had the stigma 
about everybody that’s on Section 8 are nasty, the children tear up the house, that type of thing. 
So I ran into a lot of issues with tha t.”18 For veterans utilizing the Veterans Affairs Supportive 
Housing (VASH) vouchers, a sub-set of HCVP vouchers, the U .S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development reports that landlord unwillingness to accept vouchers is a “primary 
challenge” in the administration of the program.19  In 2017, a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard 
testified before the Maryland General Assembly a bout difficulties using her VASH voucher 
because of landlord discrimination .  “I was only able to use my voucher after a housing specialist 
from the VA told me about properties in [a particular area] that take Section 8.  Let me be clear, 
this is not where  I want to live. But . . . I was at the point where my voucher was about to expire. 
I am a U.S. veteran – I signed on the line to protect my fellow citizens and I did so honorably.  I 
have no Criminal Record.  Yet . . . the same landlords that wanted me to  sacrifice my life to 
protect them won’t even let me live in their buildings.”20    
 
Source of Income Non -discrimination Laws  
 
To address discrimination against voucher holders and other persons with lawful source of 
income, state and local governments have enacted laws prohibiting discrimination based on 
lawful source of income. Currently , 12 states and the District of Columbia, including Utah, 
Oklahoma, and nearly 40 cities and counties including New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, 
Boston, and Seattl e, prohibit discrimination based on source of income.21 
 
Laws prohibiting discrimination based on source of income have increase d the ability of voucher 
holders to use vouchers and decrease d concentration s of vouchers holders.22/23 Indeed, source of 
income la ws increase the number of voucher holders moving from high to low -poverty areas.24

Laws Prohibiting Housing Discrimination are supported by International Human Rights 
Principles  
 
The international community has long recognized the United States’ failure t o adequately fight 
against tenant discrimination. The U.S. has also already ratified the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination (both with endorsement from the ABA), both of which recognize the right 
to be free from discrimination, including in housing.25     
 
In 2006, the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the disparate racial impact 
of homelessness in the U.S. and called for “adequate and  adequately implemented policies, to 
ensure the cessation of this form of racial discrimination.”26 In 2008, the UN Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination again recognized racial disparities in housing and ongoing 
segregation in the U.S.27 
   
Conclusion  
This policy will reaffirm the ABA’s commitment to ensuring that decisions about housing are 
made on the basis of bona fide qualification rather than stereotypes or prejudices.  By adopting 
this Resolution, the ABA can assist the work of housing advocates, lawmakers , and litigators that 
have tirelessly worked  to end the cycle of poverty and right the long effect s of racial and 
economic housing segregation in the United States.

affected by its adoption ? The American Bar Association has a long tradition of actively 
opposing discrimination on the basis of classifications including race, gender, nati onal 
origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. The 
Association has adopted policies calling upon local, state, and federal lawmakers to prohibit 
such discrimination in housing, as well as in public accommodations, cre dit, education, and 
public funding and has sought to eliminate such discrimination in all aspects of the legal 
profession. The ABA’s fundamental position condemning such discrimination is based on 
its underlying commitment to the ideal of equal opportunity  and advancement of human 
rights.   These two principles united in August 2013, when the ABA adopted policy to urge 
governments to “promote the human right to adequate housing for all” and to “prevent 
infringement of that right.”

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
 
1. Summary of the Resolution  
 
The resolution urges federal, state, local, and territorial governments to enact legislation 
prohibiting discrimination in housing on the basis of lawful source of income.  
 
2. Summary of the Issue that the Resolution Addresses  
 
A common form of discriminat ion in housing is the denial of housing based on a housing 
applicant’s lawful source of income.  As a threshold matter, lawful source of income 
includes income from: 1) a lawful profession, occupation or job; 2) any government or 
private assistance, grant,  loan or rental assistance program, including low -income 
housing assistance certificates and vouchers issued under the United States Housing Act 
of 1937; 3) a gift, an inheritance, a pension, an annuity, alimony, child support, or other 
consideration or be nefit; or 4) the sale or pledge of property or an interest in property.  
Lawful source of income does not prevent a property owner from determining, in a 
commercially reasonable and non -discriminatory manner, the ability of a housing 
applicant to afford to  purchase or rent the property.  
 
Every year, families are rejected from housing of their choice because their income, 
albeit lawful and sufficient in amount, is not accepted by a property owner.  Often the 
denial of housing will serve as a pretext for a pr ohibited form of discrimination.  For 
example, a property owner who does not want to rent to elderly persons will simply deny 
a housing application claiming that retirement benefits are not a sufficient source of 
income.  A property owner who does not wish  to rent to persons with disabilities will tell 
an applicant on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that government benefits are not an 
acceptable source of income.   
 
3. Please Explain How the Proposed Policy Position Will Address the Issue   
 
This policy will reaffirm the ABA’s commitment to ensuring that decisions about 
housing are made on the basis of bona fide qualification rather than stereotypes or 
prejudices. By adopting this Resolution, the ABA can assist the work of housing 
advocates, lawmakers and litigators that have tirelessly worked to end the cycle of 
poverty and right the long effects of racial and economic housing segregation in the 
United States.
