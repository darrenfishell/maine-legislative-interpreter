LD 1710
I oppose LD 1710 because forcing private landlords to solve the housing crisis is far 
from the solution.  I realize homelessness is a real problem here and everyone is 
trying to put their spin on how to resolve it.  This is not the answer.  I own and 
manage 72 units in Maine, mostly in the Bangor/Brewer area.  Many of my tenants 
are low income and several have vouchers, but that number has decreased over the 
years due to the extra issues involved.  Several of my current tenants struggle with 
mental health issues and drug problems.   I hold a bachelor's degree in psychology 
and human development which has helped me to manage my tenants who are in crisis,
but even that falls short at times.  I currently house several people who have severe 
mental illness and require a lot of my time and energy.  I have had people tell me to 
evict them because of safety concerns as well as making other tenants uncomfortable, 
but my response is "Where would they go?" I have tried numerous avenues to get help
for these individuals and come up short.  I'm aware that not all low-income 
individuals have mental health or drug issues, but in my experience, that number is 
significantly higher in that population.  There is an extreme shortage of services for 
individuals who are struggling and that is what the focus needs to be instead of 
forcing landlords to bear the burden of this simply because our business is in housing.
Instead of tying the hands of the landlords, how about finding a way to help them 
manage these tenants.  It isn't just about money for the majority of us.  It involves so 
much more than a voucher and a placement.
