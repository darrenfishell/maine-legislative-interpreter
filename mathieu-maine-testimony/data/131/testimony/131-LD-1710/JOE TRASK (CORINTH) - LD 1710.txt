LD 1710
 I oppose LD 1710, as it's a major over reach of government trying to make decisions 
for hard working people that want to make investments and try to get ahead in life 
while helping other good hard working people with finding a nice home to live in. 
This is just more giving to the bums that don't work, a free ride on the tax payers 
expense, while hurting hard working Mainers. Making a person give up 10% of their 
real-estate for low income could completely ruin their housing situation by allowing 
certain people to live there who other wise wouldn't be allowed near the property with
an almost guarantee that they will destroy it. By passing this bill, all the state will do 
is make the economy worse than it already is. More spending means higher taxes, 
we're already almost the highest in the country.
