Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, and honorable members of the 
Committee on Housing. My name is Jim Lysen, I live in Lewiston, and I am 
here to testify in favor of LD 1710.1 
I strongly believe that Housing is a Human Right. 15 years as Planning 
Director in Lewiston (and two terms on the Lewiston City Council) and 12 
years as Executive Director of a Federally-Qualified Health Center in 
Lewiston and other municipalities has made clear how important safe, 
affordable and decent housing is to so many aspects of life, like health 
care, family wellbeing, food security and economic stability. The 
organization I belong to, MaineÂ» People's Alliance, was founded in Lewiston 
40 years ago around a kitchen table in Lewiston talking about Housing 
issues. Unfortunately, we are still talking about them. Let us act now by 
supporting LD 1710! 
A housing shortage and now crisis was obviously many years in the 
making. The pandemic has further pushed the longtime housing shortage 
to the crisis level. Maine is clearly vulnerable to a wave of evictions that 
further this crisis. Nearly 60% of extremely low-income families contribute 
50% of their income to rent housing, often going without other basic 
necessities. That is NOT right! Section 8 has not adequately addressed this 
issue.I 
Evictions are traumatic events. They often cause families to lose their 
possesions, damage their family and community ties, harm their health and 
reduce workforce and school participation. We must prevent such needless 
harm. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak in front of your Committee and 
strongly encourage you to support this critical housing bill. I am prepared to 
attempt to answer any questions you may have. Thank you! 
Jim Lysen
