LD 1710
My name is Kate Howe and I am a new landlord in Portland. I strongly oppose 
LD1710. 
While I agree with the desire and necessity of fixing the housing crisis, this bill is 
completely misguided, and will exacerbate rather than help the crisis, while also 
unfairly scapegoating housing providers and singling us out for government 
interference that no other industry has.
Landlords are not the source of the housing crisis. Many landlords are small business 
owners, trying to provide safe and comfortable housing for people while as a way to 
earn a livelihood. The source of the crisis is not enough housing. The harder and more
onerous you make it for landlords to do business, the less investment there will be in 
this sector.
If the price of food is too high, the government does not badger farms, make life 
difficult for them, and fix the prices they can charge for their outputs. Instead the 
government subsidizes the price of food and incentivizes farmers to grow more. I 
don't understand why landlords are the only sector of private, small business owners 
where the government thinks that price-fixing is ok.
