T estimony
in
support
of
LD1710
My
name
is
Charlie
Gauvin.
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD1710
on
behalf
of
myself 
and
my
or ganization
–
the
Maine
Immigrants’
Rights
Coalition
(MIRC),
a
coalition
of
100+ 
member
or ganizations
representing
the
interests
and
promoting
the
welfare
of
Maine’ s 
immigrant
communities.
As
Maine
continues
to
see
new
arrivals
to
the
state
in
the
form
of 
unprecedented
numbers
of
asylum
seekers
along
with
refugees
and
humanitarian
parolees,
the 
shortage
of
af fordable
and
accessible
housing
feels
increasingly
acute
as
these
people 
struggle
to
find
the
secure
foundations
of
stable
housing
from
which
they
can
build
their 
futures
here. 
As
the
Resettlement
and
Integration
Manager
at
MIRC,
my
work
focuses
primarily
on 
supporting
asylum
seekers’
resettlement
to
Maine
by
advocating
for
and
working
on
the 
ground
to
ensure
access
to
temporary ,
transitional,
and
permanent
housing.
The
former
two 
types
are
mainly
in
the
form
of
shelters
–
unlike
refugees
and
humanitarian
parolees
(the 
program
through
which
Afghan
and
Ukrainian
individuals
have
come
to
the
US),
asylum 
seekers
have
restricted
access
to
work
authorization.
They
must
wait
six
months
following 
the
filing
of
their
asylum
application,
which
in
itself
can
take
up
to
a
year
to
prepare
in
light 
of
the
limited
resources
for
free
and
low-cost
immigration
legal
support
available
in
Maine. 
This
means
that
asylum
seeking
individuals
and
families
are
further
restricted
in
the
ability
to 
rent
apartments
as
they
are
forced
to
search
for
units
that
fall
within
General
Assistance
rent 
limits,
which
vary
across
municipalities
but
generally
speaking
lag
behind
the
increase
in 
market
rental
prices
across
the
state. 
Even
when
asylum
seekers
and
those
who
work
to
support
their
housing
navigation 
find
units
that
can
be
paid
for
General
Assistance,
which
itself
is
an
increasingly
dif ficult 
feat,
municipal
of fices
often
lack
the
leverage
or
ability
to
require
landlords
to
accept
GA 
payments.
Many
landlords
hold
negative
assumptions
about
working
with
GA
of fices,
and 
some
have
actually
had
negative
experiences
with
those
programs,
and
again
municipalities 
find
themselves
with
a
lack
of
procedural
recourse
to
work
with
landlords
on
making
GA 
payments
work
for
all
parties. 
W orking
as
closely
as
I
do
with
the
temporary
and
transitional
housing
ef forts
to 
support
asylum
seekers,
I
see
every
day
the
ener gy ,
time,
money ,
and
admirable
dedication 
that
go
into
those
projects,
but
important
as
those
shelter
and
hotel
systems
are
to
ensure 
people
have
a
roof
over
their
heads,
they
do
not
represent
the
end
goal
for
these
new
arrivals 
or
for
the
municipalities
in
which
that
they
arrive.
As
long
as
these
These
folks
come
to 
Maine
for
safety ,
security ,
and
the
promise
of
a
brighter
future,
not
to
be
reliant
on
the 
emer gency
shelter
systems,
donations,
and
public
benefits
of
Maine
towns,
cities,
and
people. 
They
are
resilient
and
resourceful,
but
have
more
to
of fer
than
their
ability
to
survive
in 
dif ficult
congregate
living
settings.
Strengthening
General
Assistance
systems
by
giving 
municipalities
better
mechanisms
to
work
with
landlords
on
accepting
GA
payments
for 
rental
units
is
a
crucial
step
in
paving
the
way
for
asylum
seekers
and
all
Mainers
to
find
the 
security
and
stability
to
realize
their
full
potential
to
contribute
to
the
greater
welfare
of
this 
wonderful
state.
Thank
you
for
your
work
to
address
this
crucially
important
issue,
