LD 1710
I am Rose Greely, I have lived in southern Maine for 35 years and I house 80 + 
people in the Cities of Portland and South Portland--half of which have rental 
subsidies
I am here with strong opposition to LD 1710.
Proposing legislation that dissuades people from investing in real estate in the midst 
of a housing shortage is counterintuitive. Making it more it more difficult for housing 
providers does not get us closer to our goal of housing more people. Adding more 
bureaucracy to a system that urgently needs creative solutions is not wise.
Providing housing is not volunteer work, it is an undeniably difficult and expensive 
business. Property tax increases, rental registration fees, ever increasing fuel costs, 
and exploding maintenance costs are the responsibility of building owners alone. Now
is the time to be encouraging and partnering with Maine housing investors to develop 
solutions that work for all Mainers.
I urge you to oppose LD 1710.
