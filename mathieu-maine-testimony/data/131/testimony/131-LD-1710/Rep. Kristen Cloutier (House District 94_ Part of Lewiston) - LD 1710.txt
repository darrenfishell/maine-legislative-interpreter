Before
the
Joint
Select
Committee
on
Housing
Good
afternoon,
Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere
and
esteemed
colleagues
of
the
Joint
Select 
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Kristen
Cloutier
and
I
represent
House
District
94,
which 
includes
a
portion
of
my
hometown
of
Lewiston.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
written 
testimony
as
a
proud
cosponsor
of
LD
1710,
An
Act
to
Establish
the
Maine
Rental
Assistance 
and
Guarantee
Pr ogram
and
Amend
the
Laws
Regarding
T enants
and
the
Municipal 
General
Assistance
Pr ogram.
This
bill,
as
amended,
takes
a
multifactorial
approach
to
address
the
many
challenges
Mainers 
face
in
navigating
our
housing
system,
both
in
obtaining
and
maintaining
housing.
One
of
the
reasons
why
so
many
Mainers
were
able
to
stay
in
their
homes
after
losing
their 
income
during
the
height
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
was
because
of
the
federal
Emer gency 
Rental
Assistance
(ERA)
Program
of
which
$292,492,480
was
provided
to
Maine,
helping 
34,207
households
across
the
state.
When
the
funding
for
this
program
came
to
an
end,
there
was 
great
worry ,
and
rightfully
so,
at
how
families
would
manage
to
hold
on
to
their
homes
without 
the
financial
assistance
they
once
relied
upon.
The
Maine
State
Housing
Authority
stopped
accepting
applications
for
ERA
as
of
September
30, 
2022.
Maine
courts
reported
that
housing
eviction
filings
in
2022
spiked
27%
as
compared
to
the 
year
before
(from
3,908
in
2021
to
4,965
in
2022),
and
landlords,
tenants
and
attorneys
have 
confirmed
that
the
end
of
ERA
has
contributed
to
this
increase.
1
LD
1710
would
require
the
Maine
State
Housing
Authority
to
establish
and
administer
the
Maine 
Rental
Assistance
and
Guarantee
Program,
which
will
include
a
state-based
rental
assistance 
component
that
would
receive
$75.5
million
in
ongoing
funds
annually .

Evictions
in
Maine
shot
up
during
2022,
with
filings
growing
27%.

Further ,
the
bill
amends
the
Maine
Human
Rights
Act
to
prohibit
discrimination
against
a
tenant 
because
the
tenant
participates
in
a
federal,
state
or
local
tenant-based
rental
assistance
program 
and
requires
owners
of
more
than
10
residential
rental
units
to
ensure
that
at
least
10%
of
the 
rental
units
meet
the
definition
of
“af fordable
housing.”
If
we
are
going
to
make
inroads
in
our
housing
crisis,
we
must
tackle
this
issue
from
multiple 
angles,
including
providing
assistance
to
those
who
are
currently
unable
to
remain
housed, 
overcoming
the
stigma
associated
with
receiving
financial
assistance
to
help
families
stay
in
their 
homes
and
a
requirement
that
more
af fordable
housing
be
provided
to
help
house
our 
community .
Housing
is
the
foundation
of
security
and
stability
in
one’ s
life.
W e
must
find
a
way 
to
provide
more
safe
and
af fordable
housing
and
LD
1710
does
just
that.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration
of
this
crucial
legislation.
