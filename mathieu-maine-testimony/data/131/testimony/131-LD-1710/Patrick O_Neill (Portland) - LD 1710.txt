LD 1710
Hello, 
I oppose LD1710 as it could harm my ability to provide for my family. 
A year and half ago when my wife and I were ready to buy a home, we found single 
family housing prices to be wildly unaffordable. As an alternative, we decided to buy 
a 3-unit multifamily, live in one of the units and rent the other two. Our multifamily 
allowed us to become homeowners by having our tenant’s rent contribute to the 
monthly mortgage payments.  
I have concerns that LD1710 could affect our small business and hurt the value of our
new multifamily property. We are passionate about providing quality housing for our 
tenants. We spend many weekends fixing up the property to make the units more 
enjoyable for our tenants and ourselves. With the inflationary pressures in the 
economy, we have found multi-family living as a necessity to provide for ourselves 
and a our 3-year-old daughter. We understand there is a housing crisis, we are victims
of it too. We had to pivot from our original dreams to stay afloat amidst rising cost 
pressures, please don’t make our new dream become a nightmare. 
Thank you for your time, 
Patrick O’Neill
