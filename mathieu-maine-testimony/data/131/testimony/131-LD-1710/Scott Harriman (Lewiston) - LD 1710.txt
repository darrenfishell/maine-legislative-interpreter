Good
morning
Senat or
Pier ce,
Repr esentativ e
Ger e,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Housing.
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
testifying
in
suppor t
of
LD
1710,
“ An
Act
t o
Establish
the

Rental
Assistance
and
Guar antee
Pr ogr am

Laws
Regar ding

also
known
as
the
HOME
Act.
As
both
a
landlor d
and
a
city
councilor
her e
in
Lewist on,
I
ha v e
seen
the
issues
facing
r enters
fr om
many
angles.
I’v e
met
people
who
ha v e
ﬁnally
r eceiv ed
a
Section
8
v oucher
only
t o
struggle
t o
ﬁnd
a
landlor d
who
will
accept
it.
I’v e
met
others
whose
landlor ds
k eep
r aising
the
r ent
as
high
as
the
mark et
will
bear ,
despite
these
tenants’
incomes
not
rising
at
anywher e
near
the
same
r ate.
Ensuring
that
people
ha v e
mor e
stability
in
their
housing
situations
is
beneﬁcial
for
r enters,
landlor ds
and
society
in
gener al.
I’v e
liv ed
in
my
home
for
less
than
six
y ears,
and
out
of
the
40-50
families
on
my
block
ther e
ar e
only
a
handful
who
ha v e
liv ed
her e
longer
than
that.
It’ s
diﬃcult
t o
build
a
sense
of
community
when
one ’ s
neighbors
k eep
getting
upr ooted
due
t o
unaffor dable
r ent.
Repeated
mo v es
ar e
also
disruptiv e
t o
childr en ’ s
education
and
de v elopment,
which
can
lead
t o
less
successful
outcomes
later
in
lif e,
potentially
continuing
the
cy cle
of
instability
with
their
own
childr en.
Please

Any
assistance
we
can
giv e
t o
help
people
attain
housing
and
sta y
in
their
homes
is
a
wor thwhile
inv estment
in
Maine ’ s
futur e.
