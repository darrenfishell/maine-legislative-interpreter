I am Roger Buck, of Portland, ME. I am opposed to this bill. It will require housing 
providers to track tenants' income, imposing significant paperwork burdens and costs 
on both. Tenants may refuse to cooperate. It is complex and unclear, but appears to 
require providers to make 10% of their units affordable to specific low income tenants
according to set affordability and income criteria. This will impose costs on providers 
that must be passed on to other tenants and discourage the construction of new 
housing. The complexity of multiple housing bills currently being considered will 
overwhelm local mom and pop landlords, leading to the consolidation of housing 
ownership in the lands of large corporate landlords with the legal staff to handle the 
complex new laws
