Senator
Pierce,
Representative
Gere,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Committee
on
Housing:
my
name
is
Raina
Overskride,
I
live
in
Lewiston
Maine
and
I
am
here
today
to
testify
in
favor
of
LD-1710.
The
reason
I
support
LD-1710
is
for
the
simple
fact
that
housing
is
a
human
right
and
everyone
deserves
a
safe
and
affordable
home.
The
growing
housing
and
homeless
crisis
within
Maine
is
proof
that
bills
like
LD-1710
are
needed.
Far
too
many
people
are
struggling
just
to
cover
rent
while
working
two
and
sometimes
three
jobs
just
to
afford
rent
and
that
is
not
even
taking
into
account
the
increased
cost
of
living
many
of
us
are
struggling
with.
There
is
also
far
too
much
discrimination
against
vulnerable
people,
disabled
people,
people
of
color
and
the
LGBTQIA+
community
when
it
comes
to
housing.
So
many
within
these
communities
are
brutally
denied
housing
due
to
systemic
racism
and
bigotry
within
the
housing
system
itself.
All
people
deserve
safe
and
affordable
housing
free
of
discrimination.
To
deny
housing
as
a
human
right
is
to
deny
the
people
dignity,
respect
and
a
bright
future.
I
urge
this
committee
to
pass
LD-1710
as
it
will
be
the
first
steps
into
building
a
brighter
future
for
the
people.
Thankyou
for
your
time.
