Senator Pierce, Representative Geer and members of the Housing Committee, my name is 
Grace vanuza Rogers and I am here to testify in support of the HOME Act, LD 1710. 
l’m a resident of South Portland Maine and this bill it's so important for me because of the 
people I sen/e daily.l’m a community case manager , cultural broker and l’m bringing todaya 
few stories that to reinforce how LD1710 it’s important: 
l will call her Manbo, a Widowed seeking asylum with 5 kids living in a small hotel room . Have 
been looking for permanent housing for more than a year . GA budget is so low that she is being 
turned down in several apartments at this point she is hopeless and with the fear that she has to 
move out the hotel room she is in by the end of June the stress, anxiety from the daily 
uncertainty it's causing her kids to not focus in school. lf LD171O is approved it will help more 
than 100 families in this similar situation. We need to work together to find a solution that will 
help and bring some hope and house stability for this families.
