207-324-5762 Maine Community Action Partnership Supports LD 1710 An Act to 
Establish the Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee Program and 
Amend the Laws Regarding Tenants and the Municipal General 
Assistance Program 
May 12, 2023 
Senator Pierce, Representative Gere, members of the Committee on 
Housing, I am Megan Hannan, Executive Director of the Maine 
Community Action Partnership and we support LD 1710 An Act to 
Establish the Maine Rental Assistance and Guarantee Program and 
Amend the Laws Regarding Tenants and the Municipal General 
Assistance Program. 
Our state's greatest resource is our people, and our state's policies 
shape people's possibilities. ln Community Action, we create conditions 
that invite children to learn and adults to apply their skills, tapping into 
the deep-rooted potential in our communities. Through our Whole Family 
approach, we build a family’s capacity for sustained stability and 
economic growth. We invest in the family's well-being, we let them drive 
their own story, and we have tangible success. 
Despite that, Maine rents are too high for most Mainers, low- and middle- 
income. Households with very low incomes are facing eviction at a much 
higher rate than others, and those with children are in even higher risk 
situations. As l have discussed here earlier, poverty, unstable housing 
and lack of support are a recipe for adverse childhood events (ACEs) 
that follow children for the rest of their lives. 
LD 1710 can help to avert that by providing rental assistance, allowing 
families to continue to work and study and be able to buy food, clothing 
and other necessities. More than half of low-income households are 
paying more than half of their income in rent. That leaves precious little 
for the rest of their needs. We do have some support for families in 
place, but too few to meet all of the needs, and too few families take 
advantage of them. 
Landlords will also beneﬁt by having stable families in their units. 
Unfortunately, some landlords choose not to rent to those with housing 
vouchers or assistance - interestingly the opposite of what we saw with 
the Federally funded rental assistance program during the pandemic. A 
new, tightly focused program would keep people in their homes, not be 
seen as a massive giveaway that leads to even higher rents. 
Thank you for your time and attention.
