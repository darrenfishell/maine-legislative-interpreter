RE: LD 1603  “An Act to Implement the Recommendati ons of t he C ommittee to 
Ensure Constituti onally Adequate Contact  with C ounsel .”  
Dear Senator Carney , Representativ e Moonen , and Members of the Committee on 
Judiciary : 
MACDL supports  LD 1603 . 
LD 1603 is a revamped version of LD 1946 from last  session. LD 1603 remove s the 
provision  from LD 1946  that made it a crime to intentionally  listen  to/record privileged  
attorney -client communications , which  was a n important protection . This is unfor tunate 
because  such p urposeful violation s of the privilege  between an att orney and his/her client 
deserve  the strongest possible protection .  
LD 1603  does,  however, still take important  steps to address the need for privilege d phone 
communications as well as meeting p laces fo r atto rneys and incarcerated cli ents. MACDL 
strongly supports these requirements.   
The creation of protocol s to protect attorney -clients communications  at all level s of law 
enforcement from the detention  facilities , prose cutor s’ offices, and law en forcement is 
likew ise an important change that this committee  should support to protect  the rights of 
incarcerated  people  in Maine.  
The right to speak and meet confidentially  is a bedr ock principle  of our crim inal justice 
system and LD  1603 takes i mportant steps to recognize and p rotect this important  right.  
For th ese reasons, MACDL support s LD 1603.  
 
                 
Sincerely ,     
 
/s/ Matthew Morgan
