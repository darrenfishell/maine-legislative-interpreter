LD1031- Resolve to improve access to childcare by Expanding Eligibility for the child care 
Subsity program
Presented by Representative LaRochelle of Augusta
Committee is Health and Human Services 
My name is Terri Crocker I'm from Bath Maine I am not for or against this bill
I am here to represent my childcare program and families the idea of raising the eligibility for 
childcare Subsidy from 85%to 150% of the states median income is  a Great  plan but we 
may want to think about the fact that a large amount of families who are already qualified are 
unable to utilize the services because they can't find programs who can or will except Subsity
Reasons
Low reimbursement rates which makes providers limit the amount of families that can be 
enrolled 
we need to find a solution to remove the market rate system with A COST OF CARE 
SOLUTION which would give providers the funds needed to take care of families the 
workforce and there businesses which then opens the doors to more children to become part 
of early learning experiences and families can get to work so Maines economy can thrive in 
all aspects of business small and large
