LD 294
I’m writing in support of LD 294. A bill that would add a Wabanaki citizen to the 
Baxter State Park Authority. The nominee would be appointed by the Governor based
on a joint recommendation of tribal governments including the Mi’kmaq Nation, the 
Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk, the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik and the Penobscot Nation. This seems an important 
step in bridging Tribal and state relations. It will also ensure the conservation of 
Baxter State Park as The Wabanaki Tribes in Maine have been good stewards of these
lands for thousands of years. I hope the committee members will recognize this and 
vote unanimously in favor of this bill especially considering Baxter State Park is on 
unceded Tribal lands. If there is a government that would have any “authority” of a 
state park in Maine it would be the Wabanaki tribal governments. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Daria Cullen
