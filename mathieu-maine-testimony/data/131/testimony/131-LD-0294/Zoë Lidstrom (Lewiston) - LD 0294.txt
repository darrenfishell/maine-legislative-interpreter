LD 294
On April 15, 2008, the Maine Legislature passed a resolution in support of the UN 
Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which declares in part that 
“Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their 
spiritual and religious traditions customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, 
protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites…” Yet, a 
decade and a half after the passage of this resolution, the indigenous peoples of 
Maine--the Wabanaki--are excluded from participating in ceremonies and 
decision-making around Mt. Katahdin, an especially sacred site to them.
Across North America, there is a growing movement of Indigenous peoples working with
public agencies toward arrangements for Indigenous involvement in the management of 
public
lands, sometimes referred to as co-management. LD 294 would add a citizen of the 
Wabanaki nations located in Maine to membership of the Baxter State Park Authority, which 
currently consists of three members: the Attorney General, the Commissioner of Inland 
Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Director of the Maine Forest Service. Adding a Wabanaki 
citizen to the Baxter State Park Authority would recognize and affirm the longstanding 
relationship of the Wabanaki peoples to Mt. Katahdin, one that has existed for vastly longer 
than any relationship of the State of Maine to the mountain.
I urge you to support LD 294 as a small yet important step toward imagining a future 
in which the original peoples of this land we all share are able to participate fully in 
decision-making around public lands and related issues of access and resource 
management. Thank you for considering my testimony.
Sincerely,
