LD 294
I write to urge passage of this bill, LD 294, to allow for tribal representation on the 
board overseeing Baxter State Park (the Baxter State Park Authority).  The park 
encompasses lands that the Wabanaki consider sacred, and for too long the Wabanaki 
have had no voice to speak on behalf of tribal  interests.  The opinions of the 
Wabanaki tribes should surely have a chance to be considered. In the interest of 
justice and fairness, please pass LD 294.
