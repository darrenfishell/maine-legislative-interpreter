I would like to see a Wabanaki Tribal member be part of the Baxter State Park 
Authority. The state of Maine was in very good shape before colonization and this is 
thanks to the good stewardship of the Wabanaki for thousands and thousands of years.
I think it would be very beneficial to have a Tribal Member be part of this committee 
and this is long overdue. We work with Wabanaki in our business as outdoor guides 
and teaching about their culture. I am always impressed at how well they work with 
and respect the land.
