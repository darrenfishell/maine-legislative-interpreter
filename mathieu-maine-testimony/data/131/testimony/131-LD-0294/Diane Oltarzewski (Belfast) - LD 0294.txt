LD 294
Senator Ingwersen, Rep. Pluecker and Distinguished Members of the Committee:
I write strongly in favor of LD 294's passage. Given that the Baxter State Park Authority is 
administered by three non-Native individuals, it seems abundantly clear that a Wabanaki 
perspective, and voice, is needed at this table in determining how best to protect Baxter's 
flora and fauna, and to continute to guide human use of what has been sacred land for the 
Wabanaki for millenia. 
I read recently about the creation of a new national park near Macon, Georgia - the Ocmulgee
Mounds, Indigenous mounds dating back to 900 - where management will be shared by the 
Muscogee Nation and the National Park Service. Maine needs to follow this example and 
open the door to shared decision-making in traditional Wabanaki territory. Please vote 
unanimously  ought to pass for LD 294. Thank you!
