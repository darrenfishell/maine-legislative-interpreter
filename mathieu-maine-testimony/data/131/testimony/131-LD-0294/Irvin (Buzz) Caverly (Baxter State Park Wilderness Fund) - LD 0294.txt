became a Commissioner with the Katahdin Lake Campaign in which capacity he served for 
several years. A project in which the committee was able to raise the seven million dollars to 
complete the sales agreement with the Gardner Land Company, for the purchase of Katahdin 
Lake. 
In addition to the Katahdin Lake Campaign, He also served 17 years as a Trustee for the 
Baxter State Park Wilderness Fund. An account that generated funds for the Park operations, so 
Baxter would be independent from the politics of Maine’s General Fund.
