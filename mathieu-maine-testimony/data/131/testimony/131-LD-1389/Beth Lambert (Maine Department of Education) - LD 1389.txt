Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee : 
LD 1389 , An Act to Establish a Mobile Learning Lab , requires the Department of Education to 
establish a mobile learning lab for hands -on STEM  learning  opportunities for students across the 
State, and provides $400K in ongoing General  Funds for 2023 -24, 2024 -25.   
 
This bill allows the Maine Department of Education to enter into a public -private partnership to 
create  a mobile learning lab  that will provide opportunities for hands -on learning for students in 
all areas of the State. The bill further provides for contracted of services to support a mobile 
learning lab. The Department of Education (DOE) must abide by the rules and regulations of the 
Division of Procurement Services which provides procurement and related services for all State 
agencies. The Division ensures that all purchases are made in an atmosphere of open 
competition. Potential purchas es include commodities, goods, and contracts. Any equipment, 
vehicle, or contract needed to satisfy this bill would be processed through Procurement.  
Currently, the DOE supports  hands -on STEAM learning through our summer professional 
development. During t he summer months, as part of the Maine Learning Technology Initiative  
(MLTI) , educators come together  to participate in professional development that guides them  
through the process of developing STEAM classroom environments that use teamwork, 
technology design, prototyping and production. Each participant receives a STEAM cart worth 
over $1,000 to bring back and use at their schools. Teachers leave the program with everything 
from power tools, 3D printers, robotics, and virtual workspaces. In addition to getting the 
STEAM carts, educators also design  units and lessons that engage in STEAM powered 
learning.  And finally, during the schoo l year, educators  who participate in the summer learning  
host full STEAM days at their schools during the school year. MLTIâ€™s student leadership 
ambassadors of Maine lead these  full day workshops where, t hroughout the day, students 
participate in STEAM activities on topics such as 3D design, coding, virtual reality (VR) and 
graphic design.  
The Department has one suggestion relating to  current D OE operational structure . As written, 
LD 1389 indicate the Mobile Learning Lab funding would be directed toward the Learning 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7801C512-3E54-4535-A7F1-657BFA416E33
Systems Team. The D epartment  has updated our team structure and directing the funding to the 
Innovative Teaching and Learning Team , which specializes in area s such as technology and 
learning policy questions, MLTI Program, learning through technology, ConnectKidsNow!, 
MOOSE, computer science, interdisciplinary learning, and rural school access equity  would be 
more appropriate .  
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD 1389  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,

Director of Innovative Teaching and Learning
