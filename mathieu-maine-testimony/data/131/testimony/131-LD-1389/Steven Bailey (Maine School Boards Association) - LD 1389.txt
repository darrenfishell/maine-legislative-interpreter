 TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1389  
 
AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A MOBILE LEARNING LAB  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cul-
tural Affairs Committee. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine 
School Boards Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the 
Maine School Boards Association neither for nor against L.D. 1389.  
 
School Boards were neither for nor against this bill because it is hard to envision 
how the learning lab could live up to the promise of reaching all students in the 
state to engage in hands -on learning in science, technology, engineering and math-
ematics, often referred to as STEM. 
 
Maine is a large state geographically, and we anticipate the proposed mobile lab 
will only accommodate a limited number of students for a limited amount of time. 
We also note the size of that population is not identified in the proposal.  
 
The price tag of $400,000 also is daunting.  
 
While a public/private partnership is suggested in the bill ’s language, that doesn ’t 
allay our concern that only a limited number of students will be served using pub-
lic dollars from the general fund. We question whether this is the best use of fund-
ing.
