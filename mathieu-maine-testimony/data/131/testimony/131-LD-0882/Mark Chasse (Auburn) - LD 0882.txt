LD 882
LD 882 ought-NOT-to pass as this legislation crosses boundaries between public and 
private business entities. Healthcare workers don't have the same benefits and 
rightfully so unless they were owned and managed by the State of Maine.
This bill presents an opportunity for a conflict of interest and the separation of state vs private 
organizations.
Thank you.
