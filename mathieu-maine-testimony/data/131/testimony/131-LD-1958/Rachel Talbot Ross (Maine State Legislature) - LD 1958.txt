Testimony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross supporting 
LD 1958, An Act to Provide the Mi 'kmaq Nation with Sales Tax Revenue 
for Sales Occurring on Mi 'kmaq Nation Territory 
Before the Joint Select Committee on Taxation 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and esteemed members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Taxation, I am Rachel Talbot Ross. I represent House District 
l 18 which is the Portland peninsula. I also have the distinct honor of serving as the 
Maine Speaker of the House. I am here today to support LD 1958, An Act to Provide 
the Mi'kmaq Nation with Sales Tax Revenue for Sales Occurring on Mi'kmaq 
Nation Territory. 
During the 130"‘ Legislature, the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation 
and the Houlton Band of Maliseets each gained the right to collect tax revenue created 
by tribal citizens only that occur on tribal lands. This new provision under LD 585 was 
signed into law, but did not include the 4”‘ tribal nation located in Maine — the 
Mi’kmaq Nation. LD 1958 would correct the exclusion. 
The Mi’kmaq Nation is a federally recognized tribe that has continuously 
inhabited northem New England and the Canadian Maritime Provinces since time 
immemorial. The population of Mi’kmaq currently located in Maine number 1,500 
tribal citizens, yet just across the Canadian border over 65,000 Mi’kmaq live across 61 
tribal reservations. 
Vllhile the beneﬁts of LD 195 9 might not be realized by the majority of Maine 
citizens, it will considerably impact Mi’kmaq tribal citizens who make their living on 
tribal lands. Placing that income into the hands of members of the Mi’kmag will 
support surrounding communities. The 2019 US Census estimates that the per capita 
income of Mi’kmaq tribal citizens is $11,431. The tax dollars that are not being 
collected by Maine Revenue Services will be a substantial boon for each Mi’l<maq 
family who can stretch their modest paychecks even further. I thank you for your time 
and attention today and ask that you act favorably on LD 1958.
