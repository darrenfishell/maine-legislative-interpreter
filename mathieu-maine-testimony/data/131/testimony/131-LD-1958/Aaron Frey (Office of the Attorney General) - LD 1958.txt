Testimony in Support of L.D. 1958, An Act to Provide the Mi 'kmaq Nation 
with Sales Tax Revenue for Sales Occurring on Mi 'kmaq Nation Territory 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and distinguished members of the Taxation 
Committee, my name is Aaron Frey, and I have the privilege of serving as Maine’s Attorney 
General. I am here today to speak in support of L.D. 1958, An Act to Provide the Mi 'kmaq Nation 
with Sales Tax Revenue for Sales Occurring on Mi 'kmaq Nation Territory. 
Last year, the 130th Legislature enacted, and the Governor signed, legislation addressing 
various aspects of the jurisdictional relationship between the tribes in Maine and the State. P.L. 
2021, ch. 681. This legislation was the result of many months of collaborative discussions between 
the tribes, the Governor ’s ofﬁce, and my ofﬁce. Among other things, the law authorized the 
Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to receive revenue attributable to the 
amount of sales taxes collected by retailers with physical locations on each tribe’s respective 
territories. See id., pt. E, § 2. The Passamaquoddy Tribe has enjoyed this beneﬁt since 1999. See 
P.L. 1999, ch. 477, § 1 (effective Sept. 18, l999) (enacting 36 M.R.S. § 1815). 
The Mi’kmaq Nation did not directly participate in the discussions during 2022, and it was 
not included in the legislation ’s tax provisions. Over the last several months, the Governor ’s ofﬁce 
and my ofﬁce have engaged in separate discussions with the Nation on various aspects of its 
jurisdictional relationship with the State. These discussions have been extremely productive, and 
we have either reached, or likely will reach, consensus on several important matters. L.D. 1958 is 
a product of our discussions. There is no doubt in my mind that the Mi’kmaq Nation should be on 
the same footing as other tribes when it comes to retaining revenue from sales collected by retailers 
with physical locations on the Nation’s lands. I thus fully support this bill and hope that you will 
as Well. 
There is one technical issue that needs to be addressed. As currently drafted, the bill refers 
to sales occurring on “Mi’kmaq Nation territory. ” The bill should instead reference “Mi’kmaq 
Nation Trust Land” and include a deﬁnition for that phrase. I understand that the Nation intends 
to request an amendment to make this change. 
I am conﬁdent that the discussions we have had (and will continue to have) with the 
Mi’kmaq Nation will result in further proposed legislation. For now, though, L.D. l958 isa 
positive step, and I urge you to vote Ought to Pass.
