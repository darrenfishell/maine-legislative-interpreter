Testimony in Support of LD 1408 
“An Act to Reduce Maine’s Dependence on Fossil Fuels and Carbon Footprint for 
Energy Production Using Waste Wood Fuel” 
April 13, 2023 
Patrick Strauch, Executive Director 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler and members of the Committee on 
Energy, Utilities and Technology, l’m Patrick Strauch, the Executive Director of the 
Maine Forest Products Council. I’m here on behalf of the Council today to present 
testimony in suppoit of LD 1408, “An Act to Reduce Maine’s Dependence on Fossil 
Fuels and Carbon Footprint for Energy Production Using Waste Wood Fuel.” 
Before discussing the merits of this bill, I’d first like to provide some history for 
context. In June of 2019, Governor Mills signed a bill into law — LD 1679 — to establish 
the Maine Climate Council. This law, which received strong support from the 
Legislature, assembled a group of scientists, industry leaders, bipartisan local and state 
officials and citizens to develop a four-year Climate Action Plan with a goal of setting 
Maine on course to decrease carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, and to achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2045. I was honored to be a member of the Maine Climate Council, 
serving as a voice for the forest products industry. 
The four-year Climate Action Plan titled “Maine Won’t Wait” was released in 
December of 2020. This report was our state’s first comprehensive scientiﬁc and 
technical assessment of climate change in a decade. Under the “Strategy C, Reduce 
Carbon Emissions ” section of the report, you will ﬁnd support for combined heat and 
power facilities under goal #4 (see attached). 
This goal states, “Maine should continue to support the growth of highly eff1cientCHP 
facilities, including through the long-term contracting authority of the Public Utilities 
Commission. ” The section also states that, “CHP avoids energy waste, reducing the 
need for additional energy consumption to accomplish heating and industrial processes. 
CHP can both reduce Maine’s emissions and support existing industrial businesses and 
large institutions with lower operating costs.” 
CHP supports a healthy market for every part of the tree, including logs, pulpwood, 
biomass energy, bark, sawdust and slab wood chips while providing base-load power 
that can supplement intermittent sources like wind and solar. This power can be brought 
online and dispatched efficiently with pricing anticipated to be below net energy billed 
projects.

As a result of the Climate Action Report, the 130"‘ Legislature worked with the G0vernor ’s Energy Office 
(GEO) to enact LD 1202, “An Act to Establish a Wood-ﬁred Combined Heat and Power Program. ” This bill, 
which received unanimous support from the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, built a program 
based on the Community Renewable Energy Pilot Program that helped in the development of CHP projects for 
Robbins Lumber in Searspoit (Georges River) and Linkletter in Athens (Athens Energy). The bill originally 
proposed a program size of 50 MW total with qualifying projects limited to 3-10 MW in size, however the GEO 
wanted to take a more conservative approach, so the EUT Committee ultimately supported a 20 MW program 
with project sizes ranging from 3-8 MW. 
The PUC is currently reviewing procurement bids now (there was interest in the program), and we will see 
which awards will be made shortly. 
LD 1408 anticipates a successful procurement process. It illustrates the demand for these types of projects and 
builds upon the goals of the Maine Won ’t Wait Climate Action Plan by increasing the program size to 40 MW 
and the size of qualifying projects to 3-20 MW. The Council is supportive of increasing the program/qualifying 
project sizes because sawmill production has increased in recent years and, in light of shrinking markets for 
residuals, we believe the investment of ratepayer funding can provide a very stable energy supply based ona 
sustainable fuel source. 
Finally, it should be mentioned that a recent report by the PUC titled “Community Based Renewable Energy 
Pilot Program Report” found CHP-generated biomass to be competitive. With natural gas prices driving up 
energy cost by about 77%, the two wood biomass projects that are part of the original program are producing 
savings for consumers of $1 .7 million, instead of an economic development subsidy. 
For these reasons, the Maine Forest Products Council urges your support of LD 1408. Thank you for your 
consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions the committee may have.
