Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, distinguished colleagues on the Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services Committee, as you know, I am 
Representative Joshua Morris and I represent the citizens of Leeds, Turner, and Wayne. 
Today I am presenting LD 308, An Ac T 0 Require That Insurance Companies Notify 
Workers over 65 Years of Age of Potential High Costs. 
This bill is about transparency. It seeks to help workers that continue to work past 
the age of 65 with understanding their insurance options. As you know, these individuals 
are eligible for Medicare part B. While I am not well versed in the issue, as I understand 
it, sometimes those that are in small group plans (less than 20 members), they incur high 
costs if they have a high-cost claim. 
This bill simply requires that health insurance companies notify workers when 
they reach the age of 65 and every year after of the possibility of high costs. Carroll 
Harper is here today and can give better insight into the more technical details 
surrounding this bill. 
I thank the committee for your consideration and would be happy to answer any 
questions that I can. 
District 91 Leeds, Turner & Wayne
