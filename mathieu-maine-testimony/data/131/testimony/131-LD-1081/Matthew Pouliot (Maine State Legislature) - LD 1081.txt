Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and esteemed members of the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources. I am here today to present LD 1081, An Act to Imposea 
Fee on Commercial Water Withdrawn from Lakes and Ponds to Fund Conservation Eﬂorts and 
Prohibit a Fee on the Sale of Water Withdrawn from a Lake or Pond, sponsored by Senator

After talking with stakeholders Senator Pouliot is asking that the committee vote ought not to 
pass on this legislation as it would have unintended consequences if it passes. 
Thank you.
