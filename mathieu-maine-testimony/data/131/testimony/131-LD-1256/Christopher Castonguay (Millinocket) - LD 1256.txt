Dear Committee Members, 
 
I am writing today to explain the importance of debt relief to attract and keep dentists in rural Maine.  I 
am a graduate of UNE (2018) and currently working as a general dentist for a federally qualified health 
center in Millinocket Maine.  This is the hometown of my father and always has been a home away from 
home to me.  I love the people and the area and knew I wanted to try and come back here to help and 
treat this community.  
 
In order to go through dental school, I had to take out about $500,000 in loans.  FQHCs and not for 
profits can't pay salaries as high as a private practice, especially as we gain experience, speed and 
worth.  Having a student debt relief program helps me to financially continue to be a rural dentist when 
it becomes more and more enticing and economically viable to leave.  I think some may assume that all 
dentists are doing well and, in comparison to the people I treat, I have no delusions that I am not.  But 
I'm still driving my 2010 Toyota corolla and pack my lunches every day!   
 
My hope is to get out of debt someday so I can be more free to do more charity care in rural areas of 
Maine.  Please consider not expanding the Maine dental education program, or at least if you do, please 
increase funding and perhaps scale the award to size of debt burden.  We are already hurting in 
Northern Maine for dentists, I'm taking patients as far south as Augusta sometimes and as far north as 
Presque Isle because no one is taking new patients.  We need all the help we can get and keep. 
 
Thank you for your consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Dr. Christopher (CJ) Castonguay, DMD
