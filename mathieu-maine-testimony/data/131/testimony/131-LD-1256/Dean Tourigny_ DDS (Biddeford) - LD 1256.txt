GENERAL  DENTISTRY
When  I first read LD 1256 An Act to Increase  Access  to Oral Health  Care  by Expanding  the 
Maine  Dental  Education  Loan  Program  I was thrilled.  What  better  way to increase  those  
personnel  who can deliver  dental  care to the people  of Maine  than to increase  the loan program  
to accommodate  more  caregivers?
The specifics  of the bill fall woefully  short  of this ideal. Access  to dental  care in Maine  will not 
be increased  by halving  the existing  loan program  for dental  students.
Any legislation  that seeks  to bring  more  providers  to Maine  must  concentrate  on increasing  funds  
available,  not depleting  a well established  funding  source  to a varied  group  of providers.
Sincerely,
Dean  Tourigny
