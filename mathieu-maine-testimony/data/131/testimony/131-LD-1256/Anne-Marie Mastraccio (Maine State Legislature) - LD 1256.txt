Testimony of Rep. Anne-Marie Mastraccio presenting 
LD 1256, An Act to Increase Access to Oral Health Care by Expanding the Maine Dental 
Education Loan Program 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement 
and Business 
Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and esteemed members of the Innovation, Development, 
Economic Advancement and Business Committee. I am Anne-Marie Mastraccio, representing 
House District 142, which includes parts of the City of Sanford and the Village of Springvale. I 
am here today to present LD 1256, An Act to Increase Access to Oral Health Care by 
Expanding the Maine Dental Education Loan Program for your consideration. 
The Maine Dental Education Loan Repayment Program provides loans and loan repayment 
assistance to dentists practicing in underserved areas in Maine. To qualify, a dentist must bea 
resident of the state, licensed or eligible for licensure to practice as a dentist in Maine, have 
qualifying outstanding education loans and be able to document employment at a qualifying 
dental care facility. The maximum loan or loan repayment amount available to each participant is 
$25,000 per year for a period of up to four years, for a total of $100,000. 
The original intent of this legislation was to encourage and recruit dentists to practice in 
underserved population areas, attempting to address a critical lack of access to dental care. I do 
not believe it ever fulﬁlled those expectations. Many participants chose to pay back the money 
borrowed rather than fulﬁll the terms of the agreement. There are fewer and fewer applicants 
every year. Over 20 years later, it is also now very obvious that training more dentists is not the 
answer. It will take dental therapists, independent practice and public health dental hygienists 
and expanded function dental assistants, all working to their full scope of practice, to move us 
forward. 
LD 1256 would expand the dental education loan program to those licensed dental professionals. 
Even if we didn’t increase the total appropriation amount available on a yearly basis, reallocating 
some of those funds to other professionals who are less costly to train would actually havea 
greater impact on patients served. Data produced by Penobscot Community Health Care‘ in

District I42: Sanford (part) and Springvale (part)
Bangor demonstrates that fact. In 2021, ten dentists and ten hygienists performed 10,890 
preventative and restorative visits and 217 crowns and root canals. After downsizing in 2022, 
there were four dentists, one dental therapist and six hygienists performing 8,749 preventative 
and restorative visits and 222 root canals and crowns. 
Dental professionals other than dentists clearly improve everyone ’s effectiveness. They are 
integral to addressing critical oral health needs and should be included in this program. I urge 
your support for LD 1256.
