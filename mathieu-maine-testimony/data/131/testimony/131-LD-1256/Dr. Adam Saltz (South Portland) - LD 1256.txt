LD 1256
There has long been a need to improve access to dental care in Maine. LD-1256 
comes at a pivotal crossroads, however, as dentists are pressured to maintain high 
quality, comprehensive care with staffing shortages that have only worsened since 
COVID-19. The answer to both these issues does not come by shunting loan support 
for dentists to dental hygienists, therapists, and assistant. It comes by additional 
funding for everyone. According to the American Dental Education Association, the 
average debt per graduating dental student in 2022 was nearly $300,000. To me, this 
grossly undervalues the actual debt of most new dentists. Many of my peers graduate 
with at least $500,000 in student loans, and more, if if they specialized. Unlike in 
medicine, the majority of postgraduate dental programs require candidates to pay for 
their additional training with some exceeding $100,000 annually. That is after at least 
eight years of higher education. We should make every effort to support new dentists 
and specialists here in Maine, not redirect what little financial assistance they now 
receive. I do not support LD-1256 as it now reads and ask members of the 
Legislatureâ€™s Innovation, Development, Economic Advancement, and Business 
Committee to seriously reconsider the goals of this bill.
