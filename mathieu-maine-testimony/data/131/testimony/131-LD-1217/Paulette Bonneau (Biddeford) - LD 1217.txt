Testimony of Wendy Ault, Chair of the Certification and Higher Education Committee 
 
Neither For Nor Against: L.D. 1217 
Resolve, to Create a Pilot Program for Alternative Teacher Certification 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs 
Emergency Bill 
 
Presented by Senator Rotundo of Androscoggin 
 
Date: April 13, 2023 
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, Distinguished members of the Education and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. 
 
We commend the efforts brought forward to improve the workforce shortages experienced in 
many of our school districts.  As you know, credentialing of educators is the purview of the State 
Board of Education. We recently undertook a thorough and comprehensive review of Chapter 
115 which resulted in needed revisions and additional pathways. It is important to note that there 
currently exist alternative pathways and emergency and conditional certificates available to 
prospective teachers. If an individual is not eligible for any certificate, a superintendent may 
request a waiver of certification to hire the individual. We commend the efforts brought forward 
to improve the workforce shortages experienced in many of our school districts.   
 
In the meantime, the State Board of Education should be included in discussions to address 
additional pathways and/or alternative means to become certified to teach.  
 
Regarding LD 1217, the State Board welcomes the opportunity to work in concert with the 
Department of Education to consider creating a pilot program for alternative teacher 
certification.  
 
Thank you for your attention to our concerns. We look forward to participating in the work 
session.
