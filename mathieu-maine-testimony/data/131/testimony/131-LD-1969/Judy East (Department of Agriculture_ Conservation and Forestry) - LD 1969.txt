IN SUPPORT OF LD 1969 
An Act to Expand the Use of Funds to Support Land Conservation 
May 22, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Judy East, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use Plamiing. I will be speaking on behalf of the 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), in support of LD 1969, An Act 
to Expand the Use of Funds to Support Land Conservation. 
The Land for Maine's Future Program is within the Bureau of Resource Information and Land 
Use Planning and is the State of Maine's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its 
natural and recreational values. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens voted 
to fund $35 million to purchase lands of statewide importance. In 1997, new priorities were set 
forth by a commission of Maine citizens. Since that time, the program has administered multiple 
bonds and even instances of general fund appropriations. State funding for land conservation has 
consistently been supported by legislators and citizens across the geographical and political 
spectrum. 
This bill eliminates and replaces the Land for Maine's Future Fund, “LMF Fund" , with the Land 
for Maine's Future Trust Fund, "LMF Trust Fund" , and transfers the balance from the LMF Fund 
to the LMF Trust Fund. Once enacted, the LMF Trust Fund may be used for the Public Access to 
Maine Waters Fund, the Maine Working Waterfront Access Protection Fund, the Maine Working 
Farmland Access and Protection Fund, and the new funds established in this legislation (the 
Conservation and Recreation Fund and the Conservation Land Management Fund). The 
Conservation and Recreation Fund is to achieve the purposes of the former LMF Fund, and the 
Conservation Land Management Fund is to make capital improvements to and enhance wildlife 
habitat protection on permanently conserved lands. The bill amends law provisions for these 
funds to credit investment earnings to the non-lapsing LMF Trust Fund.

The bill will support the long-term ﬁscal health of the Land for Maine's Future program by 
crediting investment earnings back to the fund. Land conservation transactions are complex and, 
in some instances, can take months or years to reach completion. The LMF Trust Fund will yield 
signiﬁcant investment earnings over time. Reinvesting these earnings into the LMF Trust Fund is 
consistent With the purposes of the original bonds, private donations, and appropriations 
contributed to the LMF Fund and the LMF Trust Fund in the future. 
The bill will also support the long-term capital improvement needs and habitat management 
objectives of permanently conserved lands. The conservation transactions are permanent, and 
these provisions recognize the need for trail maintenance, recreational facilities, stewardship, 
management plan creation and implementation, and habitat enhancement. Faced with increased 
public use, greater storm intensity associated with a changing climate, invasive species, anda 
host of other management challenges, we must continue to invest in conserved lands in 
perpetuity. 
We urge the committee to support this important bill for Maine. 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions now or at the work session.
