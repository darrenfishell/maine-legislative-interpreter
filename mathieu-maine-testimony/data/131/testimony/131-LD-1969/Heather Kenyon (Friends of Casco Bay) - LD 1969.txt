RE: LD 1969, An Act to Expand the Use of Funds to Support Land 
Conservation  
 
Dear Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Distinguished Members of 
the Committee,  
 
Friends of Casco Bay submits this testimony in support of LD 1969, An Act to 
Expand the Use of Funds to Support Land Conservation, and respectfully  requests 
that the C ommittee vote Ought to Pass.  LD 1969 will continue to carry forth the 
intent of Land for Maine’s Future  (LMF)  fund, established in 1987 , and will 
strength en it’s efficacy by ensuring it is adequately funded.  
 
For over 30 years, Friends of Casco Bay has worked to improve and protect water 
quality in Casco Bay and its watershed. We monitor the health of the Bay, and use 
that data to inform our advocacy and en gage our communities in efforts to prote ct 
the health of our watershed and coastal waters.  
 
Climate change is one of the biggest threats to Casco Bay. We have been strong 
advocates for  laws and policies that conserve valuable marshes and other coastal 
habitats necessary to sustain marine life, provide carbon storage to reduce our 
carbon footprint, and serve as buffers from storm surges and sea lev el rise. We are 
also supportive of  protect ing our  working waterfront  and promoting  the survival of 
our rich maritime economy.  
 
LMF funds have been critical to conserving lands tht border Casco Bay and 
preserving public and commercial access to the waterfront. For example, LMF 
funds financed the purchase of .77 acres at Holbrook’s Wharf in Ha rpswell. For 
three years we have maintained a  continuous monitoring s tation off that wharf that 
collec ts data every fifteen minutes  of every day, and will continue to do so for 
many years into the future.  These data allow us to track changes in water 
chemistry, including, but not limited to, temperature, salinity, pH, and the amount 
of calcium carbonate available for shell formation. There are few public access 
places in eastern Casco Bay where we can monitor water quality, so this site is 
critically important to  our work. Moreover, the wharf is a vital and busy 
community hub, where we often see lobstermen, tourists and locals.  
 
 
   LMF funds also purchased public land at Mere Point in Brunswick, which allows 
deep water boat launching and recreational use. We monitor  water quality 
seasonally at Mere Point , tracking such par ameters as algae blooms, dissolv ed 
oxygen, and total nitrogen . We frequently see boats launched for fishing or oyster 
farming, wormers digging on the flats, and families enjoying picnics and 
recreat ional boating. Again we rely upon this public access to do our own work, 
which in turn protects the health of the Bay for all users.  
 
LD 1969 will ensure that LMF is  funded at sufficient levels for the long term. We 
must conserve and rely upon our natural  resources to help us be resilient to climate 
change. We must preserve access to those resources to protect Maine’s unique way 
of life.  
 
For the reasons above, we respectuflly request the the Committee vote that LD 
1969  Ought to Pass. Thank you for consid ering our testimony.  
 
Respectfully submitted,
