I am in favor of this bill requiring the owners of a stolen firearm to report the loss 
theft of the weapon to a local police authority within 72 hours.  This requirement is no
more of a burden than reporting any theft to one's insurance company.  The reporting 
of lost firearms helps police trace firearms used in the commission of crimes and it 
also helps them keep firearms out of the hands of minors and people with police 
records who should not have them.
