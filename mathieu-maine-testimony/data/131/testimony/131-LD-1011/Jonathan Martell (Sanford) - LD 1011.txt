 
LD 1011 An Act Requiring the Reporting of Stolen Firearms 
  
 
Memorandum of Opposition 
Date:  May 8, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Criminal Justice and Public Safety.  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1011 An Act Requiring the Reporting of Stolen Firearms 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Opposition of LD 1011 An Act Requiring the Reporting of 
Stolen Firearms 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun 
Owners of Maine, Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club and NRA Member.  
 
While this bill may seem innocuous, it stipulates penalties on someone that may not know that a firearm was lost 
or stolen. The language “reasonably should have known that the firearm had been lost or stolen” is not defined.  
What is this attempting to solve? Law enforcement treats every firearm in evidence as though it may have been 
stolen. Any unclaimed firearms are typically sold or destroyed.  
 
This can only be a pretense for storage requirements which have been rejected many times already. This bill 
serves no purpose, and should be voted ought not to pass.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor 
Head of The Southern Maine Chapter for Gun Owners of Maine 
Legislative Officer for Sanford Springvale Fish and Game Club 
National Rifle Association Member
