LD 1011
    I am writing to express my opposition to LD. 1011 an act requiring the reporting of 
stolen firearms. LD. 1011 requires that a lawful gun owner report that a firearm has 
been stolen within 72 hours or face a penalty.  LD 1011 does not seek to punish the 
person who has stolen a firearm or require the person who has stolen a firearm to do 
anything. The penalties listed in LD. 1011 are solely directed at a lawful gun owner 
who is the vicim of a crime. LD. 1011 would not apply to a prohibited person who has
a firearm stolen from them. A prohibited person is not supposed to be in possession of
a firearm in the first place and they would be admitting to a crime if they reported 
their firearm stolen.  Since the 5th amendment to the United States Constitution 
protects against self incrimination, the prohibited person would be essentially exempt 
from any of the requirements in LD. 1011. Why should a law abiding gun owner who 
is the victim of a crime be subjected to the requirements of LD. 1011 when a 
prohibited person with a felony criminal record would be shielded from having to 
follow the same requirements? 
According to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. section 3771 a crime victim
has “the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and 
privacy.” LD. 1011 is an act that would seek to punish innocent crime victims rather 
than provide the fairness, dignity and privacy that they deserve. LD. 1011 is an affront
to a crime victims’ rights and ought not to pass.
