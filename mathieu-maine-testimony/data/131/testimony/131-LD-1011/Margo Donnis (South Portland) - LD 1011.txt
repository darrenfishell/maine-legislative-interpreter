I support this bill. This gives Mainers a duty to report lost or stolen firearms to the 
police. This way, police can respond and search for the gun(s). We need to help police
do their jobs. We need to be reminded that our firearms may be lethal in another 
person's hands. 
Especially, I want to support Maine police. I want to give them the chance to track 
down guns that may have fallen into a criminal's hands. Police face more guns than 
any other Mainers - they deserve laws that may protect them as they do their jobs.
