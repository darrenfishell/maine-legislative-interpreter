Testimony in support of L.D. 1011 & 1340 
An Act Requiring the Reporting of Stolen Firearms- 
An Act to Prohibit the Sale or Possession of Rapid-ﬁre Modiﬁcation Devices 
Dear Chair Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and Members of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Safety Committee 
My name is Lynn Ellis and l live in Brunswick. As we witness a surge in gun violence locally and 
across the country, guns remain easily accessible in Maine. Recent reports suggest there are 
more guns than ever in our state and many of those purchases, while legal, are first time gun 
owners. They are less experienced in the use and safety of securing their firearms — not only 
keeping them out of the hands of children but also safely locking them up from possible theft. 
172 guns hit the streets of Maine from guns stolen from a federally licensed gun dealer- 
happening 23 times at Maine stores between 2017 and 2021 according to an ATF report. One 
burglary can result in 15 to 20 firearms all of a sudden making its way out into unlawful 
commerce and into the hands of people that intend to commit crimes with them. 
Stolen guns can be diverted to the illegal gun market, where they are used to fuel crime across 
the country. Lost and stolen reporting laws help reduce gun trafficking by requiring individuals 
to report loss or theft to law enforcement shortly after discovering it. This common-sense 
measure can help save lives and keep guns out of the hands of those who would use them for 
harm. 
LD 1340 must pass in order to stop the insanity of using ﬁrearms to cause great harm. 
I urge you to vote in favor of these bills 
Lynn Ellis
