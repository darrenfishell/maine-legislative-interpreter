LD 1011
Dear Committee members please Oppose the Following Bills they will only make and
Burden Law Abiding Mainers thanks 
LD 1011 would require law abiding gun owners who are victims of theft to report a 
stolen firearm within 72 hours of when the owner knew or “should have known” it 
was lost or stolen. Rather than deter fraudulent gun sales, this bill would turn victims 
of gun theft into criminals and make people whose guns have been lost or stolen 
hesitant to assist police for fear of prosecution.
LD 1340 would ban legal “rapid-fire modification devices” that are already 
commonly owned and in use by Mainers. These devices include but are not limited to 
bump stocks and binary triggers that are used in a wide array of legal activities 
including competitive and recreational shooting. Possession of such devices would 
result in a Class D crime.
