LD 1011
I'm writing in opposition of LD 1011, "An Act Requiring the Reporting of Stolen 
Firearms." 
This bill would require that the owner of a firearm shall report the loss or theft of the 
firearm to a local law enforcement agency in the jurisdiction in which the loss or theft
occurred within 72 hours of the time the owner knew or reasonably should have 
known that the firearm had been lost or stolen. 
Reporting the loss or theft of a firearm to a local law enforcement agency is common 
sense, but I don't believe it should become a new gun control law. This bill would turn
victims of gun theft into criminals and make people whose guns have been lost or 
stolen hesitant to assist police for fear of prosecution. I find the 72 hour time frame to 
be arbitrary. Also, the bill doesn't clearly define what constitutes "reasonably should 
have known that the firearm had been lost or stolen." This vagueness could lead to an 
unfair prosecution of an otherwise law abiding citizen.
I urge the committee to vote "Ought Not to Pass" on LD 1011.
Sincerely, James M Waite
