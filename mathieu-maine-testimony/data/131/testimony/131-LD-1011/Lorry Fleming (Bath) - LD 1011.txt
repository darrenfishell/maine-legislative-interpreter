 
Dear Legislators of Maine: 
 
 
RE: LD 1011 An Act Requiring the Reporting of Stolen Firearms 
 
 
According to reported data, hundreds of thousands of guns are stolen in the U.S. 
each year, and in Maine, thefts are in the hundreds. What happens to these firearms? 
Where do they end up? 
 
Mostly in a life of crime.  
 
Owning a firearm requires a significant depth of responsibility. Those who leave 
guns lying around children, or who sell to strangers without background checks, or 
yes, those who suddenly find their firearm going missing and do not report it are 
NOT responsible firearm owners.  
 
The Maine Gun Safety Coalition provides this quote from a law enforcement official 
on stolen weapons and “straw purchases:”   
 
“The most difficult part of trying to put together trafficking cases is when you 
know you’ve got straw purchasers and you simply don’t have an angle to arrest 
them or indict them. The trace ends right there,” said Michael Bouchard, a 
former ATF assistant director of field operations. 
 
Without a stolen gun report, the paper trail ends at the moment of sale. “It’s 
much more difficult working leads on trafficking cases in states when there’s 
no mandatory requirement. I wish every state had them.” 
 
Maine requires the reporting of the theft of controlled substances, of child and elder 
abuse. Including the theft of firearms only makes sense. I’m not sure what the 
argument against LD 1011 could possibly be, but I’m sure there is one out there. 
Mainers are sensible people. It’s time to enact sensible gun safety laws.
