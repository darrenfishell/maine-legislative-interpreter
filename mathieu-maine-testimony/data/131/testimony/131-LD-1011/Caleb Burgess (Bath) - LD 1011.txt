LD 1011
I oppose LD 1011. 
LD 1011 would require law abiding gun owners who are victims of theft to report a 
stolen firearm within 72 hours of when the owner knew or “should have known” it 
was lost or stolen. Rather than deter fraudulent gun sales, this bill would turn victims 
of gun theft into criminals and make people whose guns have been lost or stolen 
hesitant to assist police for fear of prosecution.
