LD 1011
Honorable committee members, 
The inclusion of the words "reasonably should have known" make this bill absolute 
garbage. What is the time limit on "reasonably should have known"? Who is deciding 
what a reasonable time period to discover your firearm has been stolen should be? 
Some people keep their firearms locked up, and don't make a regular habit of opening 
the safe to count each one and make sure it hasn't walked off. This bill is either the 
disgusting result of somebody looking to turn a theft victim into a criminal, or the 
terrible result of a very out-of-touch indiviual attempting to write firearms law.
LD 1011 ought not pass!
