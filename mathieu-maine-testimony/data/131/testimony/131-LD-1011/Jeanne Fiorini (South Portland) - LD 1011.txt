I am surprised that such a requirement is not already a legal responsibility of a gun 
owner. Any other item stolen from a person would be reported for insurance or other 
motive, gun ownership must come with some responsibilities and requirements. This 
is the least we should ask of gun owners.
Please pass this legislation.
