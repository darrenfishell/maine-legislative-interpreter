Janice Vance
Kennebunk
LD 1011
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Rep. Salisbury, and members of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety Committee. My name is Janice Vance and I live in 
Kennebunk. I am a member of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, which raises 
awareness about the effects of gun violence.  I would like to combine my comments 
in support of both LD 1340 and LD 1011. I am in favor of both bills, as they are 
simple no-brainer guidelines that should be part of an overall framework for keeping 
Mainers safe. Prohibiting the modification of firearms to replicate the performance of 
AR-type firearms, which have proven to be weapons of choice for shooters looking to
kill and maim as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, makes perfect sense.
Each year seems to bring us an ever-increasing number of mass shootings, and that 
scourge has now come to Maine. Also, requiring firearm owners to report the loss or 
theft of a firearm to local law enforcement gives that agency a heads up that a firearm 
could potentially be used by a young person to hurt himself or others, or sold to a 
criminal. I would like to think it wouldn’t be necessary for a gun owner to report a 
stolen or lost firearm – because responsible owners keep firearms locked and secure 
against access by others – but if such an event occurs, local law enforcement needs to 
know. Thank you for considering these simple additions to Maine law.
