LD 1011
I am writing in opposition to LD 1011.  In what possible universe is the owner of a 
gun that a criminal has  stolen and you don't know it now the criminal. When you 
prevail (and you most certainly will) the punishment is the legal costs to defend 
yourself even as you are the actual victim. 13 States and the District of Columbia 
have a statue similar to this one. So its actually possible to know if it matters.  And 
extensive research has shown that it makes zero difference in any meaningful way to 
gun trafficking.  ATF trace data shows this as well. That there is any possible benefit 
to the people of Maine is just made up nonsense.
