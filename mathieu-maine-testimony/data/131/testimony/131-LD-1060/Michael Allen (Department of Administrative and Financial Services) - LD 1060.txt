TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: March 30, 2023 
LD 1060 — “An Act to Support Municipal Public Safety by Increasing State 
Municipal Revenue Sharing to 7 Percent” 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee — good afternoon, my name is Daniel D’Alessandro, Associate Tax 
Policy Counsel in the Maine Revenue Services, Office of Tax Policy. I am 
testifying at the request of the Administration Against LD 1060, “An Act to 
Support Municipal Public Safety by Increasing State Municipal Revenue Sharing 
to 7 Percent. ” 
LD 1060 would increase the percentage of state~municipal revenue sharing 
from 5% to 7% and require the additional funds to be used by municipalities for 
the employment, training and provision of emergency ﬁre and medical services 
and law enforcement. It is not clear what agency, if any, would be responsible for 
enforcing the funds use restrictions. LD 1060 would result in a General Fund 
revenue loss of approximately $100 million per year. 
The State has signiﬁcantly increased its commitment to property tax relief 
over the last four years by reaching 5% revenue sharing and 55% education 
funding, increasing the reimbursement for the homestead exemption, and 
increasing the property tax fairness credit. The State’s ability to sustain these 
existing commitments would be strained if revenue sharing is increased by an 
additional 2 percentage points.
The Administration looks forward to Working with the Committee on the 
bill; representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee ’s questions.
