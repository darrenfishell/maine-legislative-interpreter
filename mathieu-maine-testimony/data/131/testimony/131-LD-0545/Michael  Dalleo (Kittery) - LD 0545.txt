RE: LD 545 An Act to Establish a Cabinet-level Position to Ensure a Continuum of Care to Support 
Children and Their Families  
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, Members of the Committee of Health and Human Services  
 
As the parent of an autistic young man, I am writing to you in favor of LD 545. My son Sam was 
diagnosed at the age of 20. His development was impeded for many years due to a lack of coordination 
from his primary Doctor’s and the different schools that he was attending and their lack of procedural 
oversight that was needed to facilitate his care. Having a cabinet-level position would elevate the 
importance of the many different facets of care necessary for our children. Parents would also receive a 
greater effect knowing that a centralized office is available to support our children’s development.  
 
The Autism Society supports many families who need help navigating our complicated system of care.  
Under Child Development Services families are receiving next to nothing for services.  Many families 
with children under the age of 3 receive only one hour of parent coaching model and children 3 – 5 are 
on waitlist.  Essentially receiving nothing until they enter public school.   
 
By establishing a Cabinet-level position there will be better oversight to this very vulnerable population. 
 
I am a board member of The Autism Society of Maine, and I am an Independent Financial Adviser who is 
licensed as a Fiduciary which means I always work in the best interests of my clients. I implore you to do 
the same by establishing the Childrens Cabinet.  
 
Sincerely,
