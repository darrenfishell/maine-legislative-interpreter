Testimony in support of  (L.D. 545) . "An Act to Establish a Cabinet -level Position to Ensure a 
Continuum of Care to Support Children and Their Families "  
  
My name is Anita Tevanian and I have t he privilege to call Max my son.  
Max is a resilient and hardworking  8 year old boy with multiple disabilities related to a genetic 
condition. I renamed the condition " good boy syndrome" but to the outside world it is known 
as Vici Syndrome.  
Max requires daily PT, OT, Speech Therapy, a vision teacher, a special education teacher and 
travels 19,440 miles, per school year, to access the specialized and coordinate services in NH. 
Unfortunately, the services that Max needs are lacking in Maine and I hope you will consider 
passing LD 545, in support of an integrated developmental model, to meet the needs of 
children with special healthcare needs, such as Max.  
 
Thank you,  
Anita Tevanian  
 
 
P.S. This is my sweet boy in action.
