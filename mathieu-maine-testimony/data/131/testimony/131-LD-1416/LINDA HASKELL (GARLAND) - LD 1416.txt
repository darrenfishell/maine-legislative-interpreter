LD1416 HP912  RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of 
Maine to Increase the Percentage of the Population Required to Submit a State 
Referendum Question Testimony Opposing LINDA HASKELL Garland, 
Maine04939
I am opposing this resolution because it will make it more difficult for "we the 
people" to acquire the necessary signatures required on petitions for the people's veto 
and the direct initiative of legislation of 10% of the total vote for Governor cast in the 
last gubernatorial election proceeding the filing of the petitions. Making it more 
difficult for the people of the State of Maine should not be the agenda for legislatures.
We have a system working fine and lets keep it going as it was intended. Testimony
