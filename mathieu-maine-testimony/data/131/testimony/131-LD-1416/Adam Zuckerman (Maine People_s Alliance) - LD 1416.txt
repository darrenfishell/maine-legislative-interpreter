Good
afternoon
Senator
Hickman,
Representative
Supica,
and
Honorable
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Veterans
and
Legal
Affairs.
My
name
is
Adam
Zuckerman
and
I
am
the
lobbyist
for
the
Maine
People’s
Alliance.
MPA
is
Maine’s
largest
community
action
organization
with
over
32,000
members
across
the
state.
Our
mission
is
to
create
a
world
where
everyone
has
what
they
need,
contributes
what
they
can,
and
no
one
is
left
behind.
That
is
why
we
are
testifying
in
strong
opposition
to
LD
1416.
This
bill
would
drastically
raise
the
signature
threshold
for
ballot
initiatives,
severely
limiting
direct
democracy
and
disenfranchising
Maine
voters.
At
10%,
Maine
already
has
one
of
the
highest
signature
thresholds
in
the
nation.
By
comparison,
Massachusetts
has
a
3%
threshold.
There
are
just
two
states
that
have
higher
than
10%
and
there
is
not
a
single
state
has
higher
than
a
15%
threshold.
A
25%
threshold
would
be
by
far
the
highest
in
the
nation
and
would
make
Maine
a
drastic
outlier.
In
practical
terms,
it
would
mean
that
only
the
wealthiest
corporations–those
like
CMP
that
already
inundate
our
airwaves
with
endless
political
advertisements–would
have
the
funds
to
gather
enough
signatures
to
get
measures
on
the
ballot.
Maine
has
a
long
history
of
ballot
initiatives,
establishing
the
process
in
1909.
In
1911,
Maine
citizens
voted
to
install
primary
elections
for
party
nominees
1
,
replacing
the
old
system
of
backroom
dealings,
personal
relationships,
and
political
patronage.

Since
then,
ballot
initiatives
have
been
a
positive
force
in
our
state.
In
more
recent
history,
we
can
thank
ballot
initiatives
and
the
wisdom
of
Maine
voters
same
sex
marriage,
clean
elections,
ranked
choice
voting,
Medicaid
expansion,
raising
the
minimum
wage,
and
with
the
leadership
of
this
committee’s
Representative
Boyer,
legalized
cannabis.

Ballot
initiatives
strengthen
our
democracy.
They
are
one
of
the
only
ways
that
everyday
Mainers–those
who
can’t
afford
to
take
off
work
to
testify–can
participate
in
our
political
process.
That
is
why
I
am
here
today.
To
represent
the
thousands
of
Mainers
who
deserve
just
as
much
as
you
and
me
to
have
their
voices
heard
and
take
part
in
our
political
process.
I
thank
you
for
your
time
and
would
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
have.
