Testimony of Rep. Bruce White introducing 
LD 17, An Act to Amend the Membership Requirements of the State Claims 
Commission 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation 
Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and fellow members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation, I am Bruce White, State Representative from District 65 which 
includes part of Waterville. I am before today to present LD 17, An Act to Amend the 
Membership of the State Claims Commission on behalf of the Maine Department of 
Transportation. 
LD 17 is a department bill and proposes changes to the composition of the Maine State Claims 
Connnission. The primary responsibility of the State Claims Commission is to assure that the 
rights of property owners are protected in cases where Maine DDT has taken property for 
highway purposes. The board is comprised of ﬁve members total, two of whom are required to 
be certiﬁed real estate appraisers. This bill proposes changes to those two real estate appraiser 
positions only. 
MaineDOT is here today to further explain the need for this bill, and I will at this time defer to 
them. Thank you and I would be happy to try and answer questions the committeehas, although 
any questions are likely better suited for the department. 
District 65: Waterville (part)
