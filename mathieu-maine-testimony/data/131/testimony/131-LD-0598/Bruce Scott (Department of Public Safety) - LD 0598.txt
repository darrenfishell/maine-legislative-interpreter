Testimony of Lt. Bruce Scott 
NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 598 
An Act to Require a Vehicle Operator to Notify an Owner or Law 
Enforcement Ofﬁcer of an Accident Involving a Dog, a Cat or 
Livestock 
Senator Chipman, Rep. Williams, and distinguished Members of the 
joint Standing Committee on Transportation, my name is Lt. Bruce 
Scott, and I am the Commanding Officer of the State Police Trafﬁc 
Safety Unit. I am here today to testify on behalf of the Department of 
Public Safety and the Maine State Police NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 
598- 
This bill attempts to add a section to the accident reporting 
requirements in Title 2.9-A to speciﬁcally include an accident involving 
a dog, a cat or livestock. Current law already requires a motorist to 
report a crash to the owner of damaged property under Title 29-A 
section 22.55. This bill would speciﬁcally add a new section for damage 
to animals, that police officers, in practice, already treat as property. 
This bill would negatively affect the current law by reducing the Class 
E crime of Failure to Report a Property Damage crash down to a traffic 
violation for the ﬁrst two offenses if it involved these speciﬁc animals.

If the goal of the sponsor is to ensure that police officers have a tool to 
charge a violator with, you could simply add language within section 
2255 to speciﬁcally state that a dog, a cat or livestock is considered 
property for the purposes of that section. 
For these reasons, we are NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST LD 598. 
On behalf of the Department of Public Safety and the Maine State 
Police, I thank you for your time and would be happy to try and 
answer any questions that you might have.
