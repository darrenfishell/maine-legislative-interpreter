I won’t go into the level of sadness and grief we felt when we lost our newly acquired
rescue pup, Nekita at 530 River Road. Dresden. It was several years ago the tragic 
scene unfolded. I let her early on a Saturday morning to do her duty.  Not  5 minutes 
later I looked up to see her laying on the road at the edge of our property. Injuries on 
her body ie, torn paw pads and blood from her moth were evidence that she had been 
hit by a vehicle, however no car was in sight.   I ran up to her to find she was still 
breathing but in serious trouble.  I ran home, loaded her up
And was on my way to the vet but she passed on route.  I was devastated. Totally my 
fault she was not contained, but what made it more painful was that whoever hit her 
didn’t  have the heart to stop and see if she was ok.  I employs you to hold people 
accountable to stop  when they hit an animal. Nikita’s life could not be saved, but 
another might be. Thank you for your attention to this very important matter.
