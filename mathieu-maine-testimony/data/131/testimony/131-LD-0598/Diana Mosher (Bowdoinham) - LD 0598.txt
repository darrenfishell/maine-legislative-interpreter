LD 598
I want to encourage passage of Bill 598 . It is important that a dog, cat or livestock be 
protected in the case of being injured by a vehicle. 
 An animal that has been hurt may run away or hide. If the driver of the vehicle is not 
able to see where the animal belongs the next best thing is notify the police for help.
