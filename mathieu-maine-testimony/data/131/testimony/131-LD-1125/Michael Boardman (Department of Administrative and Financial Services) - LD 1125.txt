Michael T Boardman 
Deputy Director, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages, and Lottery Operations 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
LD 1125 — “Resolve, Directing the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to Study Paying 
Bonuses to Agents for Selling Certain Powerball Tickets” 
April 5, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, my name is Michael Boardman, and I am the Deputy Director of the 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. I am here to provide testimony neither 
for nor against LD ll25. 
LD l 125 directs the bureau to study paying bonuses to lottery agents for selling a Winning 
Powerball ticket over $10,000. Under current Powerball game rules, the bureau pays lottery agents 
a bonus of $50,000 for selling a grand prize Winner and $20,000 for selling a second prize winner. 
In addition, lottery agents earn a 5% commission on all Powerball ticket sales. 
Although the Powerball game is a national game offered in 48 jurisdictions and each selling lottery 
contributes to the jackpot prize, the funds to pay agent bonuses are the sole responsibility of the 
individual lotteries. Any change in bonuses paid to agents will impact the lottery’s transfer to the 
General Fund. . 
This resolve requires the bureau to study only the Powerball game but does not take into 
consideration other similar multi-jurisdictional games being offered by the Maine Lottery and sold 
by our retail partners. We recommend that you consider including the Mega Millions and Lotto 
America games to the study as these games also offer large rolling jackpots. 
Thank you for allowing me to testify before the Committee today. I am happy to respond to any 
questions, and of course will be available for the Work session.
