Regarding LD 123, SP 62 “An Act to Eliminate the Educational Purposes Exception to 
the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors”  
5/1/23 
 
To Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs: 
 
My name is Dianna Leighton and I write to you today as a taxpayer, parent, and former 
youth librarian in the state of Maine in opposition of LD 123, SP 62. The short version of 
my opposition is that it will not achieve the goal of securing parental rights and, in the 
process, will have a chilling effect that threatens the intellectual freedom of all public 
school students.  
Determining “obscene” materials is currently left to state and federal courts. Removing 
the existing protection from public schools means that individual school staff and/or 
entire school districts become at risk for criminal investigation and prosecution.  
 
If I believed that public schools were distributing legally defined obscene materials to 
minors, I may consider this criminal prosecution to be, well, a good thing, right?  
Except: how does that work and what does that look like?  
 
“Obscenity” is typically graded in courts using the legal test called “The Miller Test.” It 
defines obscene materials as: 
• whether the average person applying contemporary community standards  would 
find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; 
 
• whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual 
conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and 
 
• whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or 
scientific value. 
 
I’m not a lawyer or a judge, but, at face value, if we apply the Miller Test to any of the 
books found on the American Library Association’s Top 13 Banned Books of 2022 
(https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10 ), it becomes 
fairly clear that these materials are not legally obscene.  
What happens is a parent/caregiver/community member has the right to challenge a 
material, which is often detailed in a written policy/procedure per library or school 
district. I believe these policies to be an important checks and balance system, since, 
even though library staff are well-educated professionals/paraprofessionals that show 
expertise in selecting materials and maintaining collections, there has to be a way for 
the public to voice their concerns when we’re dealing with public entities such as 
schools or libraries to ensure accountability and buy-in.  
 
But when a community member challenges a material, their mere use of the term 
“obscene” does not make a material obscene. A parent may disagree with material for 
any number of reasons, but does that mean that the material is illegal? LD123 will ask 
this question with every single material challenge and the reality is that only a slim few 
(note: I’m being generous as I’ve never seen a book removed from a school library due 
to legal obscenity) will be removed. 
 
At the risk of criminal charges, some school staff may choose not to order certain 
materials out of fear, even if those materials are not obscene. As seen with libraries in 
Llano County, Texas, some public officials may simply opt to defund libraries altogether 
to circumvent or avoid court decisions entirely.  
 
The policies and procedures already in place at public schools and libraries allow a 
parent to voice their concerns and seek solutions, including alternative materials. In 
some cases, a material challenge may rightfully determine that a particular book is not 
appropriate for a particular library in accordance with library collection policies or 
curriculum. Most importantly, these policies ensure that a parent does have a right to 
determine what their child reads or doesn’t read, not the government. There is nobody 
who can tell a parent that they can’t control [or, realistically, attempt to control] what 
their child views, listens to, or reads. However, a single parent cannot and should not be 
the final authority in authorizing what materials are appropriate for all students.  
There is a difference between having access to materials and choosing to read material. 
A parent still has the moral and civil imperative to guide their child in whatever way they 
choose, even when that child has access to material that they may personally disagree 
with.  
Removing public schools from the exemption in Title 17, Chapter 93-A, §2911 
“Dissemination of obscene matter to minors” will place such a burden on individual school staff 
and entire school districts that, at best, it takes funds and resources away from serving the 
students of a taxpaying public. At worst, it can become a chilling force as districts opt to self-
censure or possibly defund libraries to avoid criminal charges, severely limiting the materials 
that students have access to and eroding their intellectual freedom. For what gains? Only the 
political goal of chipping away at trust in public institutions while using students as pawns.  
In short: no gain at all. 
Respectfully submitted,
