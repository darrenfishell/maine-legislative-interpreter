Suzanne  Dix
Gorham School Department
LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Suzanne Dix and
I am the middle school librarian in Gorham.
I oppose LD123.
In 2007, I received my Masters in Library Science.  I have never been more proud to 
hold a degree and feel honored every day that I can work among middle school 
students who are curious and enthusiastic about all things.  Putting books into their 
hands is a joy.  But even more than that it is a fundamental right of each and every 
student I work with to be able to have access to a wide range of topics that cover 
challenging concepts to broaden their perspectives and build empathy.  Using my 
degree and my experience I work hard to provide a well balanced, interesting and 
diverse collection...because my students deserve it.  Because all students deserve it.  
Removing books deemed by the very very few to be scary and obscene is 
undemocratic, unpatriotic and flagrantly ill-informed.
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously LD123 ought 
not to pass.
Sincerely,
Suzanne Dix
