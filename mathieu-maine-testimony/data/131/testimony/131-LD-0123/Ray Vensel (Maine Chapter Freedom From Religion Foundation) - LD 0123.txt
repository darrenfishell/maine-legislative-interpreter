LD 123 
 
Members of the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, this is testimony AGAINST LD 
123.  
This LD is both an attack on public schools and a use of them as a political weapon. It will make 
it difficult for school librarians and teachers to determine what is “appropriate” to share with 
students, and it gives power to a minority of people over the choices of others.  
Most, if not all schools have opt out policies. As for obscenity, are there not already existing 
laws? Public school librarians and teachers do not promote or distribute obscene materials as 
defined by law. This is already illegal.   
Education should not be a political tool. Let the professionals decide what is educational material 
and what is not. Let the parents take an active role and exercise opt-out policies. And please, let 
this bill die from a unanimous Ought Not To Pass vote. To allow a very few to remove material 
they deem to be obscene is as detrimental to public education as it is obscene in and of itself.  
Please protect Maine public education and vote against this bill. Thank you.
