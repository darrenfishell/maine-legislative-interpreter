                        May 4, 2023  Senator Rafferty, Chair Representative Brennan, Chair Distinguished Members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee  My name is Mary Gamble.  I am a resident of Roxbury, Maine and a school librarian.  I am submitting testimony in opposition to LD 123.   It is ironic that the protection for a parent/legal guardian to show inappropriate (or out of age-range) motion pictures to their children is exempted while the potential to read an educational text, e.g. Shakespeare! could be considered illegal under this law change.  Please maintain the exemption for public schools and leave the discretion of materials selection to the professional educators and librarians. It is important that we maintain free choice for students (and their parents) to select appropriate materials of interest and ability.  Please vote NO to LD 123.   Please direct questions or further discussion to:  marymartha725@gmail.com   Sincerely,    Mary Gamble
