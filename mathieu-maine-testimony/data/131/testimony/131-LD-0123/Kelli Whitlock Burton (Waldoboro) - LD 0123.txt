Sen.
Raf ferty ,
Rep.
Brennan
and
honorable
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs:
My
name
is
Kelli
Whitlock
Burton
and
I
live
in
W aldoboro.
I
of fer
this
testimony
in
opposition
to
LD
123,
“An
Act
to
Eliminate
the
Educational
Purposes
Exception
to
the
Prohibition
on
the
Dissemination
of
Obscene
Matter
to
Minors;”
LD
1008,
“An
Act
to
Establish
a
Rating
System
for
Books
in
School
Libraries;”
and
LD
618,
“An
Act
to
Eliminate
Critical
Race
Theory ,
Social
Emotional
Learning
and
Diversity ,
Equity
and
Inclusion
from
School
Curricula.”
Each
of
these
bills
use
cloaked
language
to
promote
the
banning
of
books
at
schools
across
Maine.
The
bill
text
is
strikingly
similar
to
legislation
in
other
states,
part
of
what
is
thought
to
be
a
coordinated
national
campaign
to
target
books
that
mostly
deal
with
LGBTQ+
themes
or
racism
in
American
history .
LD,
123,
1008
and
618
all
seek
to
address
problems
that
don’t
exist.
Maine’ s
librarians
do
not
distribute
obscene
materials
to
children
as
defined
by
state
statute
and
the
United
States
Supreme
Court.
And
Maine’ s
K-12
schools
don’t
teach
critical
race
theory ,
an
academic
and
legal
framework
taught
mostly
in
graduate
school.
Social
and
emotional
learning,
which
LD
618
also
seeks
to
outlaw ,
is
the
teaching
of
self-awareness,
self-management,
social
awareness,
relationship
skills,
and
responsible
decision
making.
These
are
basic
human
skills
needed
to
get
a
job,
have
healthy
relationships
and
to
thrive
in
a
civil
society .
Diversity ,
equity
and
inclusion
initiatives,
which
LD
618
would
also
ban,
seek
to
ensure
that
all
students
are
treated
and
represented
equitably
and
equally .
Why
would
anyone
seek
to
ban
these
teachings
in
schools?
Don’t
we
want
our
children
to
learn
to
be
productive
citizens
who
value
others’
rights?
Or
do
we
want
children
to
learn
that,
according
to
state
legislators,
the
First
Amendment
doesn’t
apply
to
them?
LD
123,
1008
and
618
are
blatant
violations
of
the
First
Amendment
and
promote
censorship.
They
would
harm
our
children
by
denying
them
an
honest
education,
stripping
the
history
books
of
any
mention
of
topics
that
don’t
align
with
the
worldview
of
the
small,
vocal
group
of
individuals
and
organizations
who
have
launched
similar
censorship
ef forts
in
states
across
the
country .
These
bills
take
decisions
out
of
the
hands
of
parents
and
trained
professionals
and
place
them
in
the
hands
of
people
who
are
more
interested
in
scoring
partisan
points
than
in
the
education
of
our
children.
School
librarians
undergo
years
of
education
and
training
to
reach
their
positions.
They
follow
state
law
and
educational
guidelines
when
selecting
materials
for
the
populations
they
serve.
T o
suggest
that
politicians
and
others
with
no
background
in
education
or
library
science
are
better
suited
to
select
the
books
found
in
school
libraries
is
ludicrous.
T o
allow
one
parent
to
determine
what
another
parent’ s
child
can
read
is
censorship,
a
violation
of
the
First
Amendment
and
anathema
to
the
foundation
on
which
this
nation
was
built.
I
urge
you
to
vote
Ought
Not
to
Pass
on
all
three
of
these
bills.
Thank
you.
