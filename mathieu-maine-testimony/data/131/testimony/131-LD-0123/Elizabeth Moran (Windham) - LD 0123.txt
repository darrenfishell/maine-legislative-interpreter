LD 123
I urge you to vote against LD 123, which could jeopardize local decision-making 
regarding curriculum, resources, and library materials in our schools. School 
personnel are educated, certificated, and experienced in teaching and learning. 
Certified Maine school staff should be trusted with the curriculums and resources they
use and provide for students.
School libraries should be a place where students can choose what they want to read, 
and they should contain a vast and diverse collection of reading materials that 
represent the world in which we currently live.
If a studentâ€™s guardian is uncomfortable with any instructional or library resource, 
Maine school districts currently have policies already in place that allow processes for
citizen concern and follow-up evaluation. 
Accessibility of relevant, contemporary, and engaging content to our students is an 
extremely important component for teaching, learning, and simply, growing up. 
Educators and librarians work tirelessly at making this possible for all Maine students.
Please vote against LD 123.
