Lori Gingras
Augusta
LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Lori Gingras. I am a high school English teacher and mother of two teen 
boys in central Maine. I oppose all three of the following bills:
I oppose LD 123: An Act to Eliminate the Educational Purposes Exception to the 
Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors.
I oppose LD 618: An Act to Eliminate Critical Race Theory, Social and Emotional 
Learning and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion from School Curricula.
I oppose LD 1008: An Act to Establish a Rating System for Books in School 
Libraries.
These bills, if passed, will endanger Maine children. Weapons and censorship have no
place in Maine schools. 
Sincerely,
Lori Goodwin Gingras
