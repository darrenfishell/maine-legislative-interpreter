LD 123
My name is Rachel Riendeau Caughey, a resident of Westbrook in Cumberland 
County, and I’m writing/speaking to testify against LD 123: An Act to Eliminate the 
Educational Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene 
Matter to Minors. As an active member of One Westbrook, a graduate of public 
elementary schools,  a sociocultural anthropologist, daughter of two teachers, and an 
expectant parent hoping to use Maine public schools, I recognize how this act censors 
potentially educational materials based on an arbitrary definition that is not set by 
trusted teachers and school administrators with extensive training in what is best for 
our children. This act regresses to the 1964 United States Supreme Court Justice 
Potter Stewart’s vague and dangerous threshold test obscenity in Jacobellis v. Ohio 
where obscene matter was classified as “I know it when I see it,” removing agency 
from our public school educators and opening a can of worms that could lead to the 
arbitrary, harmful prohibition of materials on sexual health and reproduction, 
including the healthy spectrum of sexual orientation and gender expression, as we’ve 
seen in other states. Limiting the free speech of teachers, the stewards of our 
children’s development, leads to stunted citizens and closed minds.  I urge legislators 
to demonstrate their support of teachers, learning, and our children. You must 
strongly oppose and fight to stop LD 123:  An Act to Eliminate the Educational 
Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to 
Minors.
