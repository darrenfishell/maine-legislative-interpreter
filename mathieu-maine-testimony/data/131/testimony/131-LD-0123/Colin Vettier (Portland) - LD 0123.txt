LD 123
Dear Committee, 
My name is Colin Vettier and I'm a Portland resident. 
I am appalled at yet another attempt to blindside our youth on some false pretense 
(that are mostly not even grounded in reality). Education should not be a political tool
to ensure our children remain ignorant to keep the people divided. 
If our politics were genuinely interested in educating the next generations, they would
fund public education or better yet, they would become teachers. In the meantime, 
they should leave it to the professionals to decide what is valuable educational 
material. 
I am against LD 123 and I hope that the committee will appreciate that banning 
subjects from schools is a clear and present danger to our freedom and democracy.
