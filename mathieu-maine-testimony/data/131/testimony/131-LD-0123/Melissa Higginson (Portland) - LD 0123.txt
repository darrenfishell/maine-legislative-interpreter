Portland
LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Melissa 
Higginson and I am a resident of Portland and an educator at RSU21. I oppose 
LD123. 
A book about sex may make someone uncomfortable. Itâ€™s a complex and very 
personal topic. But categorically describing all books about sex as obscene or 
pornographic is someone else imposing their personal morality, which tends to be 
based in whiteness, Christianity, and heterosexuality, on everyone. If you don't like a 
book at a library, don't check it out, simple as that.
I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously to not to pass LD123.
