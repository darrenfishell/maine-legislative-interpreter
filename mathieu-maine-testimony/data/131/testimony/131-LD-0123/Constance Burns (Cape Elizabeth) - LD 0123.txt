I am a retired Maine school librarian currently working with youth in a public library. 
I assure you that school librarians are highly trained professionals who spend hours 
carefully selecting the best materials possible to acquire with their limited budgets.  
Reputable book review sources are consulted and titles compared in each source. 
Book collections are carefully curated with an eye to curriculum support as well as to 
instilling a love of reading in children by offering books that serve as mirrors in which
kids can recognize themselves as well as windows that allow them to learn about 
diversity. Students develop understanding, knowledge, and empathy.  Allow the 
trained professionals to exercise their expertise. School librarians do not assign 
required reading. Parents have every right and responsibility to guide their child’s 
reading. School librarians are very willing to work with parents and put a note in their
child’s account if the parent would prefer that the student not read a certain title. 
Parents do not, however, have the right to limit other parents’ kids from choosing 
books from a carefully selected collection.  Finally, I would ask all parents: Are you 
aware what your child is accessing on their phones? It’s unlikely that online 
information is as consistently carefully selected.
