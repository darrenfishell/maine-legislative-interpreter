We do not need another bill to do this because we have existing laws that work in our 
state. Librarians do not promote, possess, or distribute obscene materials as defined in
Maine Code and decades of US Supreme Court caselaw, nor do we promote, possess, 
or distribute pornography to children. Distributing obscene materials and/or 
pornography to minors is illegal under current laws.
Our state is large and communities vary widely. Decisions about what materials 
should/shouldnâ€™t be included in a collection should be determined at the local level
School librarians are professionally trained (and credentialed) to select materials for 
the population we serve
This bill would add to an already backed-up court system, wasting taxpayer money 
and resources
Books are tools for understanding complex issues. Limiting young people's access to 
books does not protect them from life's complex and challenging issues.
Parents and individuals should be allowed to make the decision about what they can 
read and believe.
