Submitting Testimony IN OPPOSITION to LD 123 - An Act to Eliminate the 
Educational Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene 
Matter to Minors
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Matt Drewette-Card. I am a resident of Topsham, a lifelong educator, and
a parent of two learners in the Maine Public School System. I submit this testimony 
on behalf of myself and does not represent the views or beliefs of any organization, 
public or private, for which I may be affiliated. I respectfully ask the members of the 
committee to vote "Ought Not To Pass" on LD 123.
LD 123 would further politicize our education system, and the Legislature should be 
actively working to remove politicization from the education field. Key decisions 
about the use of and integration of instructional materials, textbooks, resources, and 
supplies should be left up to the local experts to decide versus at the state level. There 
are already processes and policies in place in and across school districts to confront 
and manage resources that may be deemed controversial. By putting this power into 
the hands of the Attorneys General or District Attorneys, who are political appointees,
decisions about permissible resources, materials, and the like could vary from 
administration to administration. This could cause more unnecessary instability in our
education system, and would remove the voices of the local parents, educators, 
students, and community members from their local education system.
Help maintain and support local autonomy, control, and the recommendations of the 
experts in the field by voting "Ought Not To Pass" on LD 123. 
Thank you for your time and service to Maine.
