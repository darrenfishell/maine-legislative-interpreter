LD 123  
 
Good afternoon. As both a parent and a public library director, I am submitting testimony in 
opposition to LD 123, and for two primary reasons:  
 
1. Distribution of obscene and pornographic materials to minors is illegal. There are already 
laws that cover this so legislation is superfluous.  
 
2. Restricting someone’s access to material is censorship. The decision of what someone 
chooses to read is the deci sion of that individual. A parent can guide their child’s reading 
just as they can for social media or internet use but they can’t make those decisions for 
someone else’s child. Every family and every person has their own reasons for what 
they choose to re ad. Personally, having access to such a robust collection of stories to 
share with my young children has made discussions of topics such as death, sexual 
orientation, and disabilities so much easier and relatable. I can’t hide my children from 
what they wi ll experience in the world but I can help them better understand and prepare 
them for it and these opportunities exist in their school and public libraries, free of 
censorship.  
 
 
Thank you for this opportunity to speak.
