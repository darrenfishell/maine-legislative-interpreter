Honorable committee members,
Support LD123
This is common sense legislation to protect minors from pornography.  Adults who 
have viewed materials being introduced to minors in the school system recognize 
these books are outrageous. Unfortunately, it is being allowed under the disguise of 
gender identity issues. Adults have the responsibility to protect minors.  Gender 
identity is an issue that is new to our society and needs discussion.  Pornography 
needs no discussion.
