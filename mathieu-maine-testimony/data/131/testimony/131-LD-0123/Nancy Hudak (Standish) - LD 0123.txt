LD 123
I am opposed to LD123. The law as it currently stands has worked well for thirty (30) 
years and will continue to do so without these proposed changes. 
To the best of my knowledge, every school system in Maine has a process by which 
parents/guardians can stop their *own* children from reading certain books or opt 
those children out of classes to which they object. Parents should not be permitted to 
impose their personal definition of "obscene" on others.
Teachers and school librarians have been trusted by the law for three (3) decades to 
make professional determinations about which books, texts, films, programs, and 
curricula are suitable for students in their classes and schools. There is no need to 
sabotage that trust because someone, not necessarily a parent of a student in the 
school system, thinks those professionals do not have the best interests of students 
uppermost in their minds.
Finally, exposing teachers, librarians, administrators, and school board/committees to 
potential criminal prosecution because of a non-professional's personal beliefs is 
absolutely wrong.
