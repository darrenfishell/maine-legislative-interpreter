LD 123
I am writing to oppose the passing of LD 123, “An Act to Prohibit the Dissemination 
of Obscene Matter to Minors in Public Schools.”  While the title sounds like a 
positive step forward—after all, who would want otherwise?—the language of the bill
itself does nothing to protect minors, increases pressure on schools and school 
districts, and tries to supplant the power of local communities in their decisions about 
what should and should not be in their public schools.  For these reasons, LD 123 
ought not to pass.
