STANDISH
LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. 
I oppose LD-123 because it puts an unnecessary burden on our already overwhelmed 
court system.  Our school librarians are professionals who follow good educational 
practices in selecting materials for our school libraries and LD-123 puts decisions that
should be made by educators into the court system.  Furthermore, it gives a vocal 
minority, fueled by national fringe movements to remove materials that include 
anything other than a white, heterosexual, christian family unit from educational 
institutions and this is against the Federal and State Constitutions. 
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously ought not to 
pass.
