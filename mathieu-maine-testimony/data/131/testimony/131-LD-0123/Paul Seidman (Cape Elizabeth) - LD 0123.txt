LD 123
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
My name is Paul Seidman and Iâ€™ve lived in Maine since 1978. I am writing to express
my concerns and state that I am against LD 123. 
The recent efforts to change obscenity law to target school teachers and librarians is 
misguided, political, and outrageous. Prosecuting librarians is a veiled attack on our 
First Amendment rights. I am one of the 90+% who opposes book bans and 
censorship and any law which would criminalize libraries, school books, and higher 
education.
Please vote against LD 123. 
Thank you for considering my testimony.
