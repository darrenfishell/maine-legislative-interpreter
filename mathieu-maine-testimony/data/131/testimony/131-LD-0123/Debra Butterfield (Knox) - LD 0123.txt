LD 123
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brenna, and distinguished members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs: 
My name is Debra Butterfield, and I am the Teacher-Librarian at Gardiner Area High 
School. I am also the Mentoring Chair of the Maine Association of School Libraries 
and the 2018 Maine School Librarian of the Year. 
I am opposed to LD 123 because we have policies such as IJJ in place for local school
boards that work when followed. These policies provide opportunities for community 
conversation, collaboration, and learning about the role of literacy in the lives of our 
students, school classrooms, and libraries. Following the policy locally allows for 
active engagement and decision making within school districts. This is but one vital 
conversation that can happen within our school districts that would be eliminated if 
LD 123 passes. Local control and investment in studentsâ€™ education benefits schools 
and communities by cultivating a strong partnership. 
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously not to pass LD 
123. 
Sincerely, 
Debra Butterfield
