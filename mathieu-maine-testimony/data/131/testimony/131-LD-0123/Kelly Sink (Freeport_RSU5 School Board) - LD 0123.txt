Kelly Sink
Freeport/RSU5 School Board
LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs: 
My name is Kelly Sink, and I am a member of the board of directors for RSU5. 
I oppose LD123 for the following reasons: 
1) This bill has the potential to allow the state to override local control around 
decisions most pertinent to the local communities and the schools they serve. This 
control should remain with the trusted administrators of local school districts, who are
most closely aware of their district/school’s needs. 
2) Should a large number of books, pictures, photos, artwork, and/or video material be
submitted through this process, this bill has the potential to create an undue burden of 
cost and time on the District Attorneys and Attorney General, and the already busy 
court system. The time necessary to complete due diligence to determine whether 
material is obscene or contains “literary, artistic, political, or scientific value” could 
take up valuable time in the DA and AG’s busy schedules. 
3) The determination of whether a particular book, picture, photo, artwork, or other 
media is considered obscene is a somewhat subjective process, and therefore opens 
the possibility of potentially costly and time-consuming legal challenges that must be 
navigated and resolved in the court system. 
For these reasons, I strongly urge the Committee to vote unanimously against LD123.
