Kristen Day
LD 123
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler and members of the Education and Cultural
Affairs Committee,
My name is Kristen Day, mother of three and Windham taxpayer. I have two children 
who graduated in 2020 and 2022, and their education is FAR different than my 
daughter who is a Freshman and is graduating 2026. I am in support of LD 123 and I 
ask that you vote yes so obscene materials are illegal for minors in school, as they are 
for minors anywhere outside the school walls. 
I understand the intent of the exception made for obscenity for educational purposes 
in public schools. It sounds like a reasonable exception so students are sure to have 
access to art and literature with educational value. But in the past few years, this 
exception has been stretched and exploited beyond recognition. The materials in 
school libraries contain obscenity, and some straight out pornography starting at age 
11! There are ways for kids to learn about their world without opening every 
depraved and sexually obscene adult window without discernment. 
Please vote yes to remove this exception. School Districts are not keeping kids safe 
under this law and that is what the intent of the Maine Obscenity Law is. If anybody 
calls the Statue of David obscene, that and any legitimate material used for 
educational purposes will withstand scrutiny. And they won't be pushing the kind of 
materials they are now because it will not be legal. Please vote yes!
