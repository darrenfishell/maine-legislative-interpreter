LD 123
LD 123 is a bill targeting public schools over a problem that does not exist. By 
removing public schools (and only public schools) from the list of institutions 
exempted, public educators will be open to accusations of obscenity over health and 
sexual education or even art classes. And we only need to look at Florida to see that it 
is not a stretch to imagine extremist, misinformed parents creating more problems in 
our already overburdened educational system. 
Presenting Senator Libby's response when I contacted him about how ill informed and
dangerous I consider this bill was " I am doing the best I can given (what I view as) 
filthy materials that have been adopted in school libraries." Discomfort with the topic 
of a book does not mean it is obscene. 
Please do not let Maine fall down the rabbit hole of hatred and ignorance we are 
seeing in other states. Protect and trust our public school educators.
