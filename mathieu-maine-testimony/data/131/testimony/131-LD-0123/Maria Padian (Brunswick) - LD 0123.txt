LD 123
As a Maine author of books for young readers and as a parent, I strongly oppose LD 
123. 
First: this bill is redundant. We already have existing laws that forbid distribution of 
obscene materials and/or pornography to minors. And to imply that trained, licensed 
librarians who work in our schools are doing so is an insult to all in the profession. 
Second: this bill takes local control away from districts and school boards. Given that 
our state is large and communities vary, decisions about what materials 
should/shouldn’t be included in a collection should be determined not by the state 
attorney general’s office, but by professional librarians and educators at the local 
level.
Third: as a parent, I trust educators in my children’s schools to make appropriate 
choices for them. If I, or any other parent, have an issue with a particular book, I can 
freely speak with the educator and have alternate materials provided for my child. I do
not want outside groups or the government interfering with that process.
