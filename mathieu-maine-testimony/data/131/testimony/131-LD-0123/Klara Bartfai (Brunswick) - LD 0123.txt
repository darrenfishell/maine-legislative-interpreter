Dear Members of the Committee, 
As a Maine Parent, I strongly oppose to any state censorship in our public schools. I 
would like to decide, together with other parents and my children's teacher, what 
should be read in our classrooms. History has time and time again shown that what 
was once considered to be obscene by the state -- like James Joyce's Ulysses, Allen 
Ginsberg's Howl, or Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita--has in our time become regarded as 
great contribution to our literary cannons. The state should not be the arbiter of what 
is acceptable to read, write, or say in our schools.
In our education, I believe that a variety of perspectives is of utmost importance in 
teaching our children how to navigate our complex world. Having been presented 
with a range of opinions in an environment where they can safely discuss each 
arguments merits, they learn how to stay true to their own values even while 
presented with different opinions. To remove books, is to remove the tools our 
children have at hand to successfully live in today's society. 
I urge the committee to vote no to censorship!
