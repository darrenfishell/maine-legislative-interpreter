I would like a comprehensible definition from Mr. Libby as to educational materials 
he would categorize as obscene. We have heard about the high school teacher who 
was fired for showing a photo of Michelangelo's David." Italians astonished as US 
teacher fired for showing children Michelangelo's David. Italians have reacted with 
shock after a US principal was sacked for showing students a picture of 
Michelangelo's classic sculpture David after parents complained it was 
"pornography".    Known as one of the greatest artists in history, Michelangelo's work
of art- the human body- was deemed obscene -by parents.  Teachers, well educated in 
their profession- knew its value. Parents, not trained in education, possibly not 
comprehending or appreciating the value of art in a child's life- are able to make this 
decision??? I took all three of my children to Florence to see David when they were in
elementary school, middle school, high school. They were all in awe of the statue, the 
beauty, the craftsmanship. What a loss for anyone unable to see this. Please, Mr. 
Libby- tell me, who is going to keep children from seeing works of art- because of 
their personal bias?
