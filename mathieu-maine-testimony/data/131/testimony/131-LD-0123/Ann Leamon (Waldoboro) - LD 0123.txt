Re: Testimony In Opposition to LD 123, “An Act to Prohibit the Dissemination of Obscene 
Matter to Minors in Public Schools.”

I am writing to express my devout hope that you will vote against LD 123, “An Act to Prohibit 
the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors in Public Schools.” I have two reasons for this 
argument: first, books on difficult topics help us make sense of our difficult and rapidly changing 
world; and second, banning such books will not make the difficulties and changes go away. We 
will simply be less capable of responding to these changes intelligently.  
 
As an example, consider the book Gender Queer. This graphic novel tells the life story of an 
individual who addresses questions of gender and sexual identity with honesty and openness. 
The author models open communication with friends, partners, and family. It helped me, a cis-
gender female, understand the challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ people with far greater empathy. 
The LGBTQIA+ population in the country makes up at least 8% of the total, according to a study 
by the Humans Rights Campaign Foundation based on U.S. Census data.1 We cannot just ignore 
this group. If Maine wants to solve its labor shortage problem, welcoming members of the 
LGBTQIA+ community is a good start. And creating a welcoming community starts by ensuring 
that books like Gender Queer are available at libraries.  
 
Please support my vision of Maine as a tolerant and welcoming state by voting against LD 123. 
 
Thank you.
