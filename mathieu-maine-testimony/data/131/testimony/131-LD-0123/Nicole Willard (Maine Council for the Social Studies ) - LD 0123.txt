Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs
Committee.
My
name
is
Nicole
W illard
and
I
am
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
for
the
Maine
Council
for
the
Social
Studies
(“MCSS”).
MCSS
is
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
State
of
Maine
and
we
are
af filiated
with
the
National
Council
for
Social
Studies
(“NCSS”),
the
lar gest
professional
or ganization
for
social
studies
teachers
in
the
United
States.
One
of
the
goals
of
MCSS
is
to
“provide
institutional
representation
for
the
interests
of
and
concerns
of
social
studies
educators”.
I
am
submitting
this
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
board
and
members
of
MCSS
in
opposition
to
L.D
123.
The
MCSS
Board
unanimously
opposes
LD
123.
This
bill
provides
for
an
onerous
procedure
for
determining
which
books,
art,
photos,
or
videos
used
in
public
schools
are
obscene
and
can
no
longer
be
used.
This
bill
would
overload
an
already
overworked
court
system
and
give
lawyers
not
involved
in
education
the
ability
to
decide
when
educational
material
is
or
is
not
obscene.
The
Attorney
General
or
a
District
Attorney
not
involved
in
education
would
ef fectively
determine
when
educational
material
could
be
censored
for
all.
T eachers
and
parents
in
local
school
districts
are
better
informed
about
what
may
or
may
not
be
appropriate
for
a
student
or
a
class.
This
should
remain
in
the
control
of
local
school
districts
where
administrators,
parents,
and
teachers
can
meet
to
discuss
the
educational
value
of
curriculum
and
determine
the
appropriateness
for
their
community .
