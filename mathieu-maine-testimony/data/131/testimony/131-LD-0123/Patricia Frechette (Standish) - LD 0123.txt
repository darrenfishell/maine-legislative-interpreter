LD 123
Dear Committee Members:
Quite a few books in the school system could be considered pornography.  When an 
adult has a hard time reading the book, the book is questionable indeed.  Many of 
these books are also very graphic in pictures or explanation.  These books should not 
be included in school libraries.  If parents want their children to read them, they can 
go to the Public Library.
Obscene material does not belong in the school system.
I ask that you vote to PASS Bill LD123.  Thank you.
