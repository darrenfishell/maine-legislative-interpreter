I am writing as both a parent and a librarian to oppose bill LD123, “An Act to Eliminate the Educational 
Purposes Exception to the Prohibition of Obscene Matter to Minors”, which has been amended to the new 
title, “An Act to Prohibit the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors in Public Schools.”  
 
As a parent, I believe that some books will suit my child while others will not. It is my guidance as a 
parent to help my child decide what books they wish to explore. It is not the decision of the government.  
 
I believe school librarians and educators are professionals who are there to connect students with the 
materials they need. Again, this should not be the decision of the government.   
 
Librarians are not distributing obscene materials to children. This is simply not true. Further, it is already 
illegal to distribute obscene materials to minors under current state and federal laws.  
 
Please protect intellectual freedom and do not pass LD123. 
 
Thank you,
