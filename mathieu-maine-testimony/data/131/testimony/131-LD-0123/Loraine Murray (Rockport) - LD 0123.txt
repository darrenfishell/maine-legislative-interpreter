LD 123
LD 123 is a proposed bill that is wildly inappropriate for the State of Maine.  As a 
parent I already have the right to choose what my child can read, but recognize I do 
not have the right to decide what others can read, nor should I.  We live in a diverse 
society, and what makes one person uncomfortable could be a vital resource for 
others that might only be accessible to them in the library or school. 
State obscenity laws rely on a long-standing Supreme Court decision called the Miller
Test to determine if a book or movie is actually obscene or just makes some people 
uncomfortable. The Miller Test has been used successfully since the Regan years to 
make sure any limits on a particular book donâ€™t limit our overall right to read.
Librarians and educators have extensive training and are preparing our children to be 
informed and engaged citizens of the world.  Criminalizing school librarians, 
teachers, and school districts would be a disservice to all. Schools and libraries are a 
place where students learn and grow, and restricting resources available beyond what 
laws are already in place would only serve to negatively impact our communities.
