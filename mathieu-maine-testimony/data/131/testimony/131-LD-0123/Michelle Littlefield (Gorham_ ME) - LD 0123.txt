LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee: 
My name is Michelle Littlefield, and I am a resident of Gorham, Maine. I was born 
and raised in this state and am proud to be raising my children here. I am writing to 
you to strongly oppose LD 123: “An Act to Eliminate the Educational Purposes 
Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors.”
I trust my children’s educators, their years of training, and experience in position 
when it comes to curriculum decisions. I have never once been let down in this regard
by a Maine teacher, during my own educational experience nor that of my children. 
LD 123 is not only redundant to existing policy and laws, but would also place a huge
burden on the courts and be an unnecessary drain on taxpayers and resources. It will 
turn a current culture war into a witch hunt.
Local school IJJ policies establish proper, thoughtful policy for parents to raise 
concern about any school curriculum. Instead of using existing procedures, groups of 
extremists harass Maine educators and minor children daily online and at school 
board meetings, spreading hate about this topic. This bill is being pushed by an 
extremist agenda seeking to dismantle our public schools.
Maine educators are already filled with fear. This bill will increase that fear. 
Please allow me the freedom to parent my child as I see fit. Global book bans and 
anything that supports them will harm my children. Trust our educators - do not pass 
LD 123.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Michelle Littlefield
Gorham, Maine
