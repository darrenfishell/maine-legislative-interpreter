LD 123
Dear Honorable Committee Members,
I teach English and Social Studies at Fryeburg Academy in Fryeburg, Maine.  Our 
school includes students from our region of western Maine as well as boarding 
students from around the world.  This mix of cultures, languages and social contexts 
makes for a rich and complex community.  We value this diversity greatly and draw 
upon it regularly as a source of learning.  We recognize that all students bring 
something to our classrooms and we need to recognize them equitably.
LD123 will have a unique impact upon our school community which includes 
students under both the "public school" and "private school" categories.  It will make 
it extremely difficult for our librarians and our classroom teachers to parse what is 
appropriate by law to share with our students.  It also gives a minority voice power 
over the choices of others, including those who are not steeped in the traditions of a 
Maine public school system.
Please consider the town academy conundrum as you vote to limit the freedom of 
public school educational choices.
