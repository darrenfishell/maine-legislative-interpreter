Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:
I’m writing you In response to LD 123 and LD 1008. Both of these bills are aimed 
at what students read, assuming that what they read will influence them. But as a high
school teacher, I can definitely tell you that these bills are built on an antiquated idea. 
Outside of family and friends, it is the internet and social media that influence 
children. To limit access or to put age restrictions on books that kids don’t look at, 
doesn’t address any of the issues these bills think they are targeting. It’s built on an 
assumption that students, one, go to the library, and two, they take out books. It fails 
to notice that local bookstores have disappeared from communities and that libraries 
have had to add things like the free internet and Maker Spaces to draw people in from 
their own communities. 
          Books are not the problem. Technology is the problem. If you don’t recognize 
that, then you’re not paying attention.
