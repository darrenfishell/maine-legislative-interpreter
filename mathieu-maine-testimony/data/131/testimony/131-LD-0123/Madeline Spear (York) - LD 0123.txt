LD 123
I oppose LD 123. The human body is not, and should never be considered an 
"Obscene Matter." Children should be able to learn about the functions of their own 
bodies without it being a lewd topic. They should also be able to learn and see 
artwork and literature that may contain nudity. If these topics are hidden from them in
school, I can promise you they will find false and even more pornographic versions 
online. We live in the technological era, one quick google search can show way more 
obscene matter than any playboy magazine ever could. Teach our children 
appropriately in school about the human body and they will not need to seek out these
other more harmful methods.
