LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
I previously submitted testimony in opposition to LD123. I understand Sen. Libby has
submitted different wording which would render my testimony invalid. I would like to
update my testimony to add the following that addressed Libby's additions:
How this will burden our District Attorneys and Attorney General? How much time 
this will take up in the already busy court system? This feels like a misuse of their 
time.
 
How much this will cost the state with trials to determine if books challenged are 
obscene? This is a misuse of funds. Will this take away local control?
I continue to believe that LD123 is misguided and harmful to our institutions.
