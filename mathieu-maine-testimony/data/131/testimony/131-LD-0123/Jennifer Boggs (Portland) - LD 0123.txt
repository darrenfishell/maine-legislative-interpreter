LD 123
I am a parent of a 7th grader, and books and libraries (public and school), have been a
critical resource for both me and my daughter. I trust the librarians and teachers who 
work at those places; they never force books on us but rather offer information and 
CHOICE.
Banning books is not healthy for a democracy…and it’s not healthy for our family 
either. I do not want my right to read threatened. 
Please vote AGAINST LD 123 — and keep the right to read free.
Respectfully,
Jennifer Boggs
