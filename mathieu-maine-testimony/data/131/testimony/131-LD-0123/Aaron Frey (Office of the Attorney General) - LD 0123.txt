Testimony in Opposition to LD 123, An Act to Eliminate the 
Educational Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the 
Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee On Education and Cultural Affairs, my name is Aaron Frey, and I have the privilege to 
serve as Maine’s Attorney General. I oppose LD 123, An Act to Eliminate the Educational 
Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene Matter to Minors andI 
encourage the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass. 
Current law already provides a sufficient process for the Attorney General or a District 
Attorney to respond to allegations that obscene material is being distributed to minors. This 
proposed language adds nothing to a prosecutor ’s ability to protect minors from material thata 
court determines to be obscene. If there is an adjudication under 17 MRS § 2911(3) that declares 
certain material to be obscene, a prosecutor does not need a statute to direct them to respond to an 
allegation that the same material is being disseminated to a minor elsewhere. The Office of the 
Attorney General and District Attorney Offices are already primed to address those reports. 
This legislation is unnecessary as my ofﬁce, and District Attorney Ofﬁces, already have 
sufﬁcient means to address allegations that obscene material is being distributed to minors. I 
respectfully request the Committee vote this bill ought not to pass.
