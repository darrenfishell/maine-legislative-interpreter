Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, 
 
 
My name is Sarah Sparks, and I am a resident of New Gloucester. I am a parent and an 
educator in my community.  I am writing against LD 123, “An Act to Eliminate the 
Educational Purposes Exception to the Prohibition on the Dissemination of Obscene 
Matter to Minors.”  I would agree that we have an obligation to keep youth safe and 
protected. I am concerned that there may be unintended consequences if such an act 
were to become reality, in particular as it relates to education. As we commonly see 
now in local districts, what one person believes to be obscene is viewed differently by 
others.  
 
We have an obligation to our young people to provide access to information and foster 
development of the skills to navigate understanding the context as appropriate. This 
applies to a variety of topics, including history, literacy, and personal development. 
Reading and knowledge is one big tool we have to become good humans. Restricting 
access at a large scale is a barrier. Any parent should be able to determine a particular 
content is not appropriate for their child, but it is not appropriate for any individual to 
determine that content is not appropriate for everyone.  
 
I urge this committee to consider the implications of LD 123, as well as other proposals 
that attempt to restrict access for people who may benefit from seeing others like 
themselves represented in text or learning about portions of well documented history 
that tell stories of individuals and/or cultures. Knowledge and information is power. We 
need to help our young people understand the world around them, where we have been 
and the possibilities of where we may go as a society.  If public education is not able to 
support this knowledge and skill development, who will? 
 
 
Thank you.
