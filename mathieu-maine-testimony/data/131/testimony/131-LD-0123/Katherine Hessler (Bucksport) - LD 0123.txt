LD 123
I am writing to oppose LD123.  S.R. Ranganathan--considered the father of Library 
Science--introduced his 5 Laws of Library Science in 1931.  Two are particularly 
relevant to this conversation.  #2: Every reader his or her book, and #3: Every book its
reader.
As a school librarian, I am guided by these tenets every day.  Each of my students has
particular needs, and every book I select for our collection (by combing through 
reviews but also by listening to our students and honoring appropriate requests) has a 
purpose and an audience that needs it.
Our students need books they can see themselves in; they also need books that help 
them see life through other's perspectives.  I help them find what they need, which 
also includes making them aware of the themes of the books and the difficulty (both 
content and readability) they might experience.  It is up to the student then whether or 
not they will borrow a particular title.
If a parent does not want their child reading a particular title/author, they are welcome
to contact me and I will respect their authority as a parent.  However, they cannot 
determine what other parents deem appropriate, and even important, for their own 
children to read.  
This bill will do immense damage to our students, their education, their freedom to 
read, and allows a specific and narrow morality to rule in a public setting where all 
are welcome, heard, and seen.
