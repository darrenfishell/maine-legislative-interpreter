LD 123
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and esteemed members of the Education 
and Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Kristen Day. I was born and raised in Maine, and have raised 3 kids in 
Windham for the past 20 years.
I am writing in support of LD123. Schools are in violation of the MDOE rule 
"Resources shall be appropriate to the ages of the children served by the school." I'm 
sure you are well aware of the controversy with obscene content being discovered in 
library materials in Maine school libraries for minors as young as 11. Any intent for 
obscenity to be legally excepted in public schools for educational purposes is being 
FAR exceeded. The intent is being exploited to the point where in our RSU14 middle 
school there is a fantasy book in which young adults engage in detailed, pornographic 
(sexually arousing) sex. In another book, boys at camp are masturbating in a circle 
into a soda bottle and whoever doesn't do it has to drink it. Because some schools are 
not willing to manage their content to be age appropriate according the MDOE rule, 
the exception needs to be removed by enacting LD123.
Schools are working through loopholes to keep these materials. By reason of 
"diversity" if it's lgbtq characters, even if they are using strap ons, vibrators, or licking
vaginal slime. Or they consider the material as a "whole" not portions even if they are 
"literally" pornographic. 
If LD123 is passed, there will be robust discourse about what constitutes "obscenity," 
but we don't have any problem identifying what is inappropriate for kids anywhere 
outside the school walls. Why are some adults fighting to put the most depraved, 
obscene materials in front of kids in school? When ethics fail, the law must step in to 
protect our children. Please vote yes on LD123.
