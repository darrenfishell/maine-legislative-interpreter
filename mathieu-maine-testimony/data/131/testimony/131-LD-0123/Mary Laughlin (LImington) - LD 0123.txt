Re: Opposition to LD 123
Dear Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Mary Laughlin and I live in Limington.
I am writing to oppose LD 123.
As I understand, an amendment to the bill’s original language has recently been 
proposed by Senator Libby.
The bill in its current amended form seems to target public schools for 
“disseminating” obscene material.
It is not made clear what is meant by “disseminating.”
Does it mean to have certain books simply available in the school libraries? 
And to propose that the attorney general or district attorney ”finds” that the public 
school is disseminating the obscene matter seems to be an expensive and 
time-consuming process.
The result of their investigation–which could involve appeals and trials and great 
expense–would be, as proposed, a “cease and desist order” to the public school.  A 
“cease and desist” order for this issue would override local school district decisions, 
and that is a consequence I cannot support.
Thank you. 
Mary Laughlin
