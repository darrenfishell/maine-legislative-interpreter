LD 123
  I cannot be in Augusta to personally testify today, but I want to express to each of 
you, that I fully support LD123.  Not only do I support it, but I am of the opinion that 
this legislation is sorely needed!  A generation of our state and country are being 
cleverly indoctrinated right within their public school to become desensitized and 
hypersexualized into the fallacy that pornography, even at a young age, is not 
harmful!  Our school libraries are filled with verbiage and graphics that are nauseating
to even many adults and certainly damaging to young people.  Preteens and young 
teens do not have the maturity, nor the physical brain development to handle 
extremely vivid descriptions of rape and incest and fisting and sexual manipulation, 
all of which are intertwined with foul language.  If you are unaware of what is 
available to your preteens and teens in public schools, I urge you to visit the website 
Booklooks.org   Enter one of these two titles and the site will give you a list of 
concerns about the book and some sample pages for you to read:  Let’s Talk About 
Sex by Erica Moen & Matthew Nolan or Jesus Land, A Memoir by Julia Sheeres or 
Identical by Ellen Hopkins.  If you haven’t ever done this, I think you will be shocked
that we are distributing this garbage to children! 
                While I generally believe that educational decisions are best left to local 
control, I have come to see that this movement to desensitize and hypersexualize 
children is beyond even a state issue.  The major goals of this movement is to replace 
the word “pedophile” with “Minor Attracted Person” and, worst of all, to eliminate 
the age of consent for sexual activity between adults and children!  (The U.N. just 
made a recommendation to do that last week!!!).  Please support LD123 and help 
protect Maine students.
