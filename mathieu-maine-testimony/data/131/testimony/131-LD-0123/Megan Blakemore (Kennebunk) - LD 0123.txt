LD 123
As a librarian and as a parent, I strongly oppose LD 123. This act is predicated on the 
idea that teachers and librarians are giving obscene material to children. This simply 
is not true and to give this fallacy any credence is a slap in the face of educators. 
Further, this act takes local control away from districts and school boards. Instead of 
allowing the experts in the school to make decisions, it puts the AG's office in the role
of censor, a part they surely do not want to play.
Finally, as a parent, I trust the educators in my children's schools to make appropriate 
choices for them. If I have an issue with the materials selected, I can speak with the 
educator. I do not want outside groups or the government to interfere with that 
process.
