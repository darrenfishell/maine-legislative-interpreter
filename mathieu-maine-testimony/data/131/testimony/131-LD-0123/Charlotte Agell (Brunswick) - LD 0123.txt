LD 123
Dear Legislators,
I am a recently retired lifelong public school teacher who objects to LD 123 with 
heart, mind, and soul. What one parent/community member might find "obscene" will
vary so much. Please trust librarians (and teachers) to be the professionals that they 
are. We already have a law about this concern. Librarians do not promote, possess, or 
distribute obscene materials as defined in Maine Code and decades of US Supreme 
Court caselaw, nor do we promote, possess, or distribute pornography to children. 
Distributing obscene materials and/or pornography to minors is illegal under current 
laws.
