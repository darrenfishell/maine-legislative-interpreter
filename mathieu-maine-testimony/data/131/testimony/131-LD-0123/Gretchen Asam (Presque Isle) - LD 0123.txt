I am writing you as a past President of the Maine Association of School Libraries, having also served many terms as their board’s Intellectual Freedom chair.  Senator Libby’s proposal is not only redundant, as it is already illegal in the state of Maine to provide obscene material to minors; it is also intrusive.The decision on what children may or may not read is not the purview of state legislators, but the children themselves in discussion with their families.  Libraries exist not to promote one particular point of view, but to provide access to a broad range of opinions.  This is as it should be in an free and open society.Librarians and other teachers are speciﬁcally trained to select age-appropriate material to support and complement the curriculum.  Both professionals are required to have Master’s degrees.  They also live in the area where they teach, which cannot be said for the State Legislature, and are far better at recognizing the needs, interests, and concerns of their communities.I submit that we need to trust the people who have invested time and treasure in entering this profession, but beyond that, we need to trust the students themselves.  In thirty-one years as a high school librarian, I saw many instances of students returning books with which they were uncomfortable, which other students read with great enjoyment.  They know what they are ready for, and it’s our job not to restrict their reading, but rather, to get out of their way.Thank you for your attention.
