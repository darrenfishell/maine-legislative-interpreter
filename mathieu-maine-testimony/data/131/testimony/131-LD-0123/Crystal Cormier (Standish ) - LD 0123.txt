I am a parent of a middle schooler  and I have a lot of concerns over the obscene 
material that has been brought to the forefront being shared with our minor children at
public schools. The material graphically describes lewd sexual acts, pedophilia, rape, 
incest, masturbation and much much more.  I have spoken out at board meetings and 
feel strongly that the material in books like boy toy, choke, push, and gender queer 
are all not age appropriate for our minor children and if these books were given to a 
minor off school grounds, this would be considered dissemination of obscene material
to minors. Why is it our public school library gets an exemption to this rule?  It’s not 
right. The law states that as long as these books are purely educational then they can 
stay. Who determines this?  What does purely educational even mean?  So if these 
books are purely educational then I have a really hard time digesting the material…. 
teachers raping minor students, sex toys, blow jobs and anal sex??   How much more 
are we going to allow?  How far will this be allowed to go?  Mental health is a serious
issue and that’s what we need more focus on. Not this!  I support the removal of this 
exemption and I want this filth out of public schools.
