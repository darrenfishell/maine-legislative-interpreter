Let’s allow teachers and librarians do their jobs.   
Please do not be persuaded by a minority group who happen to be vocal in their 
beliefs.   Parents have a right to determine what their children read….and that is 
debatable.  
But they do NOT have the right to determine what books are to be banned for the 
general population.
