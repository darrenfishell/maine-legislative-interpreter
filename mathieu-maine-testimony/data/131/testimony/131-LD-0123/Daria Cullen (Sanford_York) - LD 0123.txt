LD 123
I’m writing to oppose LD 123 because it will take away exemptions specifically made
decades ago to protect educational materials such as historical works of art and 
literature. There’s absolutely no reason to ban these materials and potentially place 
educators in situations where they could be incarcerated or have our children miss out
on experiencing great works. This bill is yet another example of skewed priorities. I 
ask the committee to please vote ought not to pass and continue to protect educational
materials. Thank you.
