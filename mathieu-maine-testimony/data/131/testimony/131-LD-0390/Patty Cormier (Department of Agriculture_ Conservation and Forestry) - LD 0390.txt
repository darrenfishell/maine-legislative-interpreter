TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE,

IN SUPPORT OF LD 390 
Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Portions of Chapter 25: Standards for Placing Wood 
into Stream Channels to Enhance Cold Water Fisheries Habitat, a Major Substantive Rule of 
the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Bureau of Forestry 
February 27, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Patty Cormier, and I am the Director of the 
Maine Forest Service. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry in favor of LD 390. 
Chapter 25, in part, sets forth standards for placing large wood into stream channels for 
ﬁsheries enhancement. It also provides a streamlined review process for projects overseen by 
licensed foresters and ﬁsheries biologists by removing the requirement to obtain a Natural 
Resources Protection Act (NRPA) permit. 
The current rule is modeled after standards developed by the state of Oregon, and reﬂects the 
size and availability of trees in that region. Amendments to the Iule are intended to alter the 
appropriate tree diameter and loading rate to better reﬂect Maine tree availability and sizing 
and enable more ﬁsheries enhancement projects to be undertaken. The proposed amendments 
are closely aligned with cun‘ent Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) standards to 
minimize the impact on riparian habitat. 
The Maine Forest Service (MFS) briefed key stakeholders before undertaking rulemaking. 
MFS released the draft rule for public comment in August 2022, and a public hearing was 
held; no one attended. The MFS received just one set of comments - from the Department of 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife - which contained only grammatical edits and no substantive 
suggestions regarding content or intent. 
The Maine Forest Service (MFS) will administer this rule as it currently does. MFS works 
closely with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife on rule administration, 
partnering in the delivery of required training for licensed foresters and ﬁsheries biologists. 
In recent years, MFS has seen very few ﬁsheries enhancement projects use the Chapter 25 
rule, in part because the standards are difﬁcult to meet given the difference in tree size 
between Maine and Oregon. MFS developed these amendments in close consultation with 
ﬁsheries biologists and other natural resource managers with consideration of past

experiences implementing these projects in Maine. These changes should encourage ﬁsheries 
enhancement projects in more locations across the state while reducing the regulatory burden 
on licensed foresters and ﬁsheries biologists. 
Please note that after Provisional Adoption, we learned the effective date of this rule was written 
incorrectly. The Secretary of State advised us that this does not invalidate the rule; however, the 
committee must correct the effective date as an amendment to the Resolve. The correct effective 
date is June l, 2023. 
Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions now or at the work session.
