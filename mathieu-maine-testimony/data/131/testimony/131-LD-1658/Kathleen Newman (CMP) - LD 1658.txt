ORDER   6  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 I. SUMM ARY  
The Commission finds  that the construction and operation of the New England 
Clean Energy Connect (NECEC  or Project ) is in the public interest and, therefore, there 
is a public need for the Project.  Accordingly, the Commission issues a certificate of 
public convenience and necessity  (CPCN)  for the NECEC.   In addition, t he Commission 
approves the Stipulation filed in this proceeding on February 21, 2019 .  
 
 The Commission’s finding that the NECEC meets the public interest and public 
need standards is  based on a careful weighing of the be nefits and costs of the NECEC 
to the ratepayers and residents of the State of Maine.  As required by Maine statute, 
these include the effect s of the NECEC on economics, reliability, public health and 
safety, scenic, histor ic and recreational values, an d state renewable energy goals.  35-A 
M.R.S.  § 3132(6).  Based on its consideration of these factors, the Commission finds 
that the NECEC is in  the public interest.   
 
 The Commission conclude s that the NECEC meets the applica ble statutory 
standards for a CPCN  independent of  the additional benefits that will be conveyed by  
the February 21, 2019 Stipulation .  However, the provisions of the Stipulation augment 
the benefits of the Project.  
 
The NECEC will allow for up to 1,200 MW of hydropower to be delivered to New 
England from Québec , Canada.  The cost of constructing and operating the NECEC will 
be borne by customers of Electric Distribution Companies in Massachusetts (MA EDCs) 
and Hydro Québec  (HQ).  Because the NECEC -enabled p ower will be delivered into 
Maine, however, significant benefits will accrue to Maine electricity consumers  through 
operation of the regional wholesale market.   These benefits are expected to accrue  for a 
period of at least 20  years.   In addition  to the  wholesale electricity price  reductions  that 
will result from the NECEC , the Project will also  enhance  system reliability and fuel 
security within Maine and the ISO -New England (ISO -NE) region.  In addition, the 
NECEC will provide environmental benefits by di splacing fossil fuel generation in the 
region, and associated greenhouse gas (GHG)  production , and wi ll provide substantial 
benefits to the Maine economy through the more than 1,600 jobs expected to be 
created during the NECEC construction phase, and on an  ongoing basis through 
property taxes.  
 
The provisions of the NECEC Stipulation augment the benefits that will be 
realized by Maine ratepayers, communities and the environment by funding 
mechanisms and programs to provide rate relief to Maine ratepayers, b enefits for low -
income customers, and support for a variety of other programs intended to benefit 
Maine communities and the environment.  
 
With respect to the  effects of  the Project  on scenic and recreational values, and 
the associated impacts on tourism a nd the economies of communities  in proximity to the 
Project,  the Commission finds that these effects will  be adverse .  However, when these  
adverse impacts  are balanced against the ratepayer, economic, and environmental 
benefits of the NECEC, t he Commission  finds that these adverse effects  are 
ORDER   7  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 outweighed by the benefits .  Moreover, the Commission expects that the scenic and 
recreational  impacts  of the NECEC  will be reviewed and, to the extent appropriate and 
feasible, mitigated, through the processes at the Maine Departmen t of Environmental 
Protection ( DEP) and Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC).   
 
Figure I.1  provides a summary of the impacts to Maine of the NECEC and the 
Stipulation provisions:

II. PROJECT BACKGROUND   
A. NECEC Facilities  
 
The NECEC will enable the delivery of up to 1,200 MW of hydro electric power 
from Québec, Canada to New England  for a period of at least  20 years.   The expected 
commercial operation date of the NECEC is December 2022.   The core elements of the 
Project are : (1) a new 320 kV overhead high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission 
line, approximately 145 miles in length, from the Québec /Maine border to a new 
converter station in Lewiston, Maine and a new 1.6 mile 345 kV AC transmission line 
from the new converter station to Central Maine Power Company’s (CMP)  existing 
Larrabee Road Substation in Lewiston and (2) a new converter station at Merrill Road in

The NECEC ’s proposed route is on private land that CMP owns or controls , 
including existing corridors for more than half its length.   The proposed corridor for the  
new HVDC transmission l ine portion of the NECEC  extends approximately 145.3 miles 
ORDER   10  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 from the Québec -Maine bor der at Beattie Township, in northern Franklin County, to the 
Larrabee Road Substation in Lewiston.  Additionally, the Project includes upgrades to 
existing AC network facilities in various locations on CMP’s existing transmission 
system.  
 
The northern port ion of the HVDC line is proposed to be built in currently 
undeveloped corridor primarily traversing commercial forest land, and the remainder of 
the corridor will be built within the undeveloped width of existing transmission corridors.  
The corridor begins  in western Maine in Beatti e Township (Franklin County) and 
extends southeast for about 4½ miles across Beattie Township, touches the southwest 
corner of Lowelltown Township (Franklin County) and then extends easterly about 27 
miles across Skinner Township  (Franklin County), then across Appleton Township, 
Raytown Township, Hobbstown Township, Bradstreet Township, and across the 
southwest corner of Parlin Pond Township (all in Somerset County) .  From that point, 
the corridor crosses onto Johnson Mountain Tow nship extending southerly about 6½ 
miles over the approach to Coburn Mountain and into the valley between Coburn 
Mountain and Johnson Mountain and then turning east for about 2½ miles to the U.S. 
Route 201 .  Between the border and U.S. Route 201, the corri dor is a 300 -foot wide 
parcel .    
 
The 300 -foot wide corridor continues south across West Forks Plantation about 
4¾ miles to the Kennebec River and the West Forks Plantation/Moxie Gore line (all in 
Somerset County).   From the Kennebec River, the 300 -foot w ide corridor extends about 
49 miles southeast across Moxie Gore and the Forks Plantation to the intersection with 
an existing transmission corridor near the Lake Moxie Road .  The remaining  section of 
the NECEC will be constructed on the existing corridor.  
 
The estimated cost of the NECEC is approximately $1 billion.  As noted above, 
these costs will be paid for entirely by H.Q. Energy Services  (U.S.) INC.  (HQUS)  and 
the MA EDCs.  
 
D.  Massachusetts RFP Process and Results  
The NECEC is a component  of a bid p repared jointly by CMP and Hydro 
Renewable Energy Inc. (HRE), an affiliate of Hydro - Québec , that was s ubmitted in 
respon se to a Request for Proposals (RFP ) issued by the MA EDCs  pursuant to Section 
83D of the 2008 Massachusetts Green Communities Act  (Gree n Communities Act) .  
Pursuant to the Green Communities  Act, on March 31 , 2017, NSTAR Electric Company 
d/b/a Eversource Energy (Eversource), Massachusetts Electric Company and 
Nantucket Electric Company d/b/a National Grid (National Grid) and Fitchburg Gas and 
Electric Light Company d/b/a Unitil (Unitil) , in coordination with the Massachusetts 
Department of Energy Resources (DOER ), issued a n RFP seeking bids to provide 
incremental clean e nergy  and associated environmental attributes  for approximately 
9.45 TW h annually under long -term contracts  of 15 -20 years.  The RFP set a proposal 
due date of July 27, 2017.   
ORDER   11  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Forty-six bid packages2 were received on or by the due date, including joint bids 
submitted by CMP and  HRE3 offering two different NECEC configuration s.  Following a n 
evaluation process by the MA  EDCs and DOER, on January 25, 2018, an all -
hydro electric bid submitted by HRE  and Northern Pass Transmission LLC ( Northern 
Pass) was selected for contract negotiations.   On February 1, 2018, the New Hampsh ire 
Site Evaluation Committee (NHSEC ) denied the Northern Pass siting permit .  On 
February 17, 2018, CMP was notified that the NECEC had been selected as the 
alternate winning bid.    
 
 The contractual arrangements underlying the NECEC include power purchase 
agreements (PPA) between HQUS (the successor to HRE) and each of the purchasing 
utilities in Massachusetts and transmission services agreements (TSA) between CMP 
and the MA EDCs and between CMP and HQUS.  The PPAs  and the TSAs  were  filed 
for approval with th e Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) on July 23, 
2018.4  The Massachusetts DPU proceedings are on -going.  In addition, CMP filed the 
TSAs for approval by  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)  and, on 
October 19, 2018, the TSAs wer e accepted by FERC to become effective October 20, 
2018 .5 
 
 As shown in Figure II.1, the PPAs are for different amounts of capacity, totaling 
1,090 MW of the 1,200 MW capacity  of the NECEC, and all extend for a 20 -year term.

 Figure II.1 
 
 As shown in Figure II.2, there are seven different  TSAs  with CMP, three 
corresponding to the capacity and term of the PPAs with the MA EDCs .  Three 
additional TSAs correspond to the ca pacity of the PPAs with the MA  EDCs, but are 
between CMP and HQUS for years 21 -40 of  the expected life of the NECEC line.  The 
final TSA is a 40 -year agreement between CMP and HQUS for the remaining 110 MW 
of the line.    
Figure II.2 
 
 The PPAs and TSAs contain customary commercial terms and conditions and 
include provisions specific to the Green Communities Act and Section 83D solicitation.  
Generally, the PPAs  provide  for the delivery of an aggregate of 9,554,940 MWh 
annually of incremental hydroelectric generation and related Environmental Attributes 
from HQ US delivered through the NEC EC Transmission Line  to the delivery point in 
Lewiston, Maine .  Each PPA also includes a methodology by which baseline and 
incremental energy deliveries are calculated.6  The PPAs also include provisions for 
reimbursement from HQUS for failure to meet deli very obligations.  The PPAs do not

based on an init ial 9.45 TWh volume subject to  certain potential adjustments, while the 
Eversource and Unitil initial annual volume is 3 TWh, adjusted only for force maje ure 
events.

in opposition to the Project, and three witnesses testified neither for nor against the 
Project.   
 
D. Briefs and Public Comments  
   
On February 1, 2019, CMP, OPA, IECG, GINT , NextE ra, CLF, NRCM, Acadia 
Center, Caratunk, Lewiston, IB EW, Chamber, Ms. Kelly, RENEW, and WM &RC filed  
initial  briefs and on February 13, 2019, C MP, OPA, IECG, GINT, NextEra, Caratunk, 
and Ms. Kelly filed reply briefs.  
 
In their initial briefs, CMP , IECG, OPA, Chamber, Lewiston, IBEW, and WM &RC 
argue that the C ommission should find a public need for the NECEC and issue a CPCN.  
These parties argue that the NECEC will lower regional energy and capacity costs, 
provide nee ded infrastructure to enhance the resilience of the grid, result in the export 
of clean hydrop ower generation from Québec  into New England, and provide economic 
benefits through increased tax revenue and employment.  The IECG and OPA’s support 
for the P roject is conditioned on CMP transferring the NECEC into an  affiliate, or special 
purpose entity (SPE) to construct, own and operate the NECEC line and that Maine 
ratepayers be held harmless from the prior inclusion of costs arising from  NECEC in 
regional or local transmission rates .   
 
GINT , NRCM, NextEr a, Caratunk, REN EW, and Ms. Kelly oppose the ap proval 
of the Project , arguing that CMP has not satisfied its burden to demonstrate that there is 
a public need for the NECEC .  These intervenors argue  that the NECEC is about an 
environmental policy initiated by another state  (Massachusetts ); it will not  result in 
signif icantly lower electricity rates;  it will not reduce GHG  emissions , and could even 
result in  increase d emissions ; its design will discourage the development of Maine -
based wind and solar renewable generation ; and it will permanently damage scenic, 
ORDER   16  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 historical, and recreational values  in western Maine and result in a substantial loss of 
tourism.   RENEW  states that any approval of the Project should be conditioned on CMP 
increas ing the transfer capability on the Surowiec -South interface.    
 
CLF and Acadia Center argue that the Commission should require CMP to 
commit to a significantly more robu st Project benefits package that includes substantial 
financial, resource and planning commitments that will, among other things, advance 
Maine’s renewabl e energy goals, Maine’s economy , and Maine’s public health.  
Specifically, the Commission should require the Project to mitigate potential impacts on 
existing and future Maine -based renewables and to do more to advance the public 
health in Maine, including  substantial financial contributions toward the decarbonization 
and electrification of Maine’s transportation and heating sectors , including toward the 
expansion of electric vehicle and electric heat pumps .   
 
In addition to the party arguments presented i n the briefs, the Commission 
received over 1,35 0 public comment s.  Most of the public comments oppose the 
NECEC, primarily on the grounds the Project will result in irreparable harm to the 
environment and scenic values of western Maine,  harm to wildlife , and negative impact s 
on regional  tourism.  
 
E. Stipulation  
 On February 21, 2019, CMP filed a Stipulation and supporting memorandum i n 
this case .  The Stipulation is sup ported by OPA, GEO, IECG, CL F, Acadia Center, 
WM&RC,  Lewiston, the  Chamber, IBEW, and FM M.  The following parties oppose the 
Stipulation: NextEra; Ms. Kelly; GINT ; NRCM; REN EW; MREA; ReEnergy; Caratunk; 
Former Senator Thomas Saviello, the Town of Wilton, and Old Canada Road.   
 
On a February 21, 2019, a Procedural Order was issued that provide d parties an 
opportunity to provide written comment on the Stipulation.  Written comments were filed 
by GFDC, FMM, Caratunk, IBEW, NRCM, the Chamber, RENEW/MREA, Ms. Kelly, 
ReEnergy, CLF/Acadia Center, IECG/OPA, GEO, GINT, and Old Canada Road.  A 
hearing w as held on the Stipulation on March 7, 2019.   
 
F. Examiners’ Report  
On March 29, 2019, an Examiner s’ Report was issued which contained Staff’s 
recommendations on the issues in this proceeding.  Exceptio ns or comments on the 
Examiners’  Report were filed on  April 8, 2019 by the following parties:  ReEnergy, 
IECG, GINT, NRCM, WM&RC, Caratunk, CMP, NextEra, and Ms. Kelly.  
 
IV. STATUTO RY REQUIREMENTS  
 The governing statute in this proceeding is Title 35 -A, Section 3132.  This 
Section states that “a person may n ot construct any  transmission line … unless the 
commission has issued a certificate of public convenience and  necessity approving 
construction.”  Section 3132(6) requires that, in its Order, the Commission “ shall make 
ORDER   17  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 specific findings with regard to the p ublic need for the proposed transmission line. ”  The 
Section also states that the Commission “ shall make specific findings with regard to the 
likelihood that nontransmission alternatives can sufficiently address the identified public 
need over the effectiv e life of the transmission line at lower total cost. ”   
 
 Specifically, Section 3132(6) requires that:  
In determining public need, the commission shall, at a minimum, take into 
account economics, reliability, public health and safety, scenic, historic 
and recreational values, state renewable energy generation goals, the 
proximity of the proposed transmission line to inhabited dwellings and 
alternatives to construction of the transmission line, including energy 
conservation, distributed generation or load ma nagement.   
Chapter 330  of the Commission’s Rules , Section 9(B) , specifies that a “public need” is 
established upon a determination that “ratepayers will benefit by the proposed line” 
taking into account the statutory criteria cited above.    
 
In recognitio n of the unique nature of this proceeding, the Hearing Examiners, on 
January 14, 2019, issued a Procedural Order identifying several specific legal issues for 
the parties to  address in post -hearing briefs.  The Commission discusses these legal 
issues and v arious requirements of Section 3132(6) below. 8 
 
A. Public Need  
 As stated above, Section 3132(6) provides , in part , that the Commission shall 
make specific findings with regard to the public need for the proposed  transmission line  
and, if the Commission f inds that a public need does exist, it must  issue a CPCN .  In 
determining public need, the Commission is directed to consider a number of  factors .  
However, the terms “public need”  and “public convenience  and necessity” are  not 
expressly defined in the sta tute.  
 
 In a typical CPCN proceeding, a Transmission and Distribution (T&D) utility 
identifies a reliability need and proposes a transmission project to address that need.  
The Commission th en examines the extent of the reliability need and whether the 
proposed project is the lowest -cost means to address what is a “public need.”  In 
contrast, the NECEC is not proposed to address an identified reliability need, but rather 
to import power from Québec  through Maine to meet a public policy of Massachusetts.   
 
 The January 14, 2019  Procedural Order asked the parties to address:  
                                                           
8 The issues identified in the January 14, 2019 Procedural Order included the 
applicability  of Title 35 -A, Section 707 and Chapter 820 of the Commission’s Rules with 
respect to housing the project in a separate corporate affiliate and good will payments.  
Provisions included in the Stipulation address these matters; accordingly, the 
Commission does not addre ss these legal issues in this Order.  
ORDER   18  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 How should the “public need” standard pursuant to section 3132(6) be 
considered and evaluated in the context of the NECEC as opposed to the more 
typical reliability transmission project ? 
 
1. Positions of  the Parties  
 
 CMP, IECG , and WM&RC argue that, in determining whether the public need 
has been met, the statute does not preclude the Commission from considering the 
impact of these various factors on the broader region, including other New  England 
states or needs specified by the Massachusetts  solicitation.  CMP Initial Br. at 8-15; 
IECG Initial Br. at 11-12; WM&R Initial Br. at 4-5.  CMP, IECG and IBEW argue that 
“public need” is analogous to a “public benefit ” or “public welfare,” which i s a flexible 
concept that requires a balancing of the benefits of the Project against its costs and 
risks.  CMP Initial Br. at 5-8; IECG Initial Br. at 11-14; IBEW Initial Br. at 2-3.  The OPA 
takes the position that the term “public need” is broad enough to encompass funds 
provided to Maine communities and citizens to mitigate any harms that could flow from 
the construction and operation of the NECEC .  OPA Initial Br. at 19-22. 
 
GINT  and Caratunk argue that t he Commission should only focus on whether the 
NECEC meets a Maine public need  in that i t must be assumed that the Maine law 
governing the approval of electric transmission projects in Maine was  not designed to 
accommodate a public need in another state.  GINT Initial Br. at 73-76; Caratunk Initial 
Br. at 7-9.  NextEra  argues, that , in interpreting public need, the Commission should not 
approve the NECEC if it conflicts with one or more of the statutory  criteria.   NextEra 
Initial Br. at 2-4. 
2. Discussion  
 Section 3132 does not define what constitutes a “public need .”  However, the 
meaning of public  need in the context of a public convenience and necessity proceeding 
is established in case  law.  The Law Court has recently construed “public  convenience 
and necessity” as being synonymous with “public benef it” or “public interest.”   Enhanced 
Communications of Northern New England, Inc. v. Public Utilities Commission , 2017 
ME 178, at fn. 4 ; See also  Zachs v. Department of Public Utilities , 547 N.E.2d 28, 32 
(Mass. 1989)  (holding that the phrase “public conven ience  and necessity ” is a term of 
art that stands for the general notion of public interest ).   
Thus, the “public need” standard in this case is essentially a general standard of 
meeting the public interest .  A determination of “public interest” generally requires a 
careful weighing of the benefits and costs of the Project, including those that are 
quantifiable and those that are not.  With respect to whether the “public” includes 
regions beyond Maine, the Commission interprets the statutory public interest  standard 
to pertain to Maine.  In this case, the standard involves consideration of the benefits and 
costs of the NECEC to Maine’s ratepayers and residents, rather than its role in meeting 
energy policies in another s tate.  Finally, the Commission disagre es that every factor 
identified in the s tatute for consideration by the Commission must be satisfied or 
ORDER   19  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 promoted for a “public need” determination to be made, as long as, on balance, the 
overall benefits of the Project outweigh the costs.  
  
B. Nontransmis sion Alternatives  (NTA)  
Title 35 -A, Section 3132(2 -D) requires that the Commission “ consider the results 
of an investigation by an independent 3rd party … of nontransmission alternatives to 
construction of the proposed transmission line .”  In addition, Sect ion 3132(6) states that 
the Commission “ shall make specific findings with regard to the likelihood that 
nontransmission alternatives can sufficiently address the identified public need over the 
effective life of the transmission line at lower total cost. ” 
In the January 14, 2019 Procedural Order, the Hearing Examiners asked parties 
to address:  
 
How should section 3132(2 -D), which states that the Commission shall 
consider the results of an independent third -party investigation of 
nontransmission alternatives  to the proposed transmission project, be 
considered in the context of the NECEC as opposed to a reliability 
transmission project?  
 
1. Positions of  the Parties  
 
CMP, IECG, OPA, Acadia Center, CLF , and WM &RC argue that t he statutory 
provisions were drafted und er an expectation that a proposed  transmission line is being 
constructed either for reliability purposes or to provide Maine with  energy, as historically 
has been the case.  CMP Initial Br. at 166 -169; IECG Initial Br. at 17-18; OPA Initial Br. 
at 23-24; A cadia Center Initial Br. at 4; Kelly Initial Br. at 8-9, NextEra Initial Br. at 6-8.  
In this case, the public need is to deliver hydroelectric energy from Québec  to 
Massachusetts .  In addition, these parties note that, because the NECEC will not be 
paid f or by Maine rate payers, there cannot be a lower -cost NTA alternative.  
 
NRCM, NextEra, GINT , and Ms. Kelly  argue that nothing in the statute exempts a 
project with no reliability component, like the NECEC, from the requirement of a CPCN 
applicant to conduct  an NTA investigation.  NRCM Initial Br. at 5-7; NextEra Initial Br. at 
6-8; GINT Initial Br. at 76-78; Kelly Initial Br. at 8-9.  Therefore, a n investigation must be 
conducted in this proceeding to determine whether a n NTA can economically and 
reliably ad dress the p ublic need identified for the NECEC.  
 
 2. Discussion  
 
The Commission concludes that, because t here is no NTA that can feasibly 
substitute for the NECEC , the statute does not require that an independent analysis of 
the costs of potential NTAs be  conducted.  The purpose of the NECEC is to transmit 
hydro electric generation from Québec to New England to meet the requirements of the 
MA EDCs .  Thus, n o NTA, w hether large -scale generation, distributed generation, 
demand response resource, or conservati on alternative , can replace the NECEC.  A 
ORDER   20  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 contrary interpretation of the statute that would require a n NTA analysis would lead  to 
absurd results and cannot be the intent of the Legislature. Town of Madison, Dep't. of 
Elec. Works v. Pub. Utils. Comm'n , 682 A.2d 231, 234 (Me. 1996) (plain meaning will be 
applied so long as it does not lead to an absurd, illogical, or inconsistent result).9 
 
This conclusion is consistent with the Commission’s decision in Docket No. 2010 -
00180  that approved a stipulation and is sued a CPCN allowing CMP to construct a 
transmission line reinforcement, despite the absence of an NTA  analysis .  In that 
proceeding, the Commission held that an NTA was “not feasible,” because it required 
adding load behind an identified export constraint , and CMP could not “force the 
location of customers.”  Central Maine Power Company and Public Service Company of 
New Hampshire, Request for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the 
Somerset County Reinforcement Project Consisting of the Cons truction of 
Approximately 39 miles of 115 kV Transmission Lines (“Section 241”),  Docket No. 2010 -
00180, Order Approving Stipulation at 10 -11 (Aug. 15, 2011).  
 
C. Public Health and Safety, Scenic, Historic and Recreational Values  
 
 The January 14, 2019 Proc edural Order asked parties to address the following 
issue:  
 
Based upon the assumption that the Legislature did not intend that the 
Commission duplicate the functions of the Department of Environmental 
Protection (DEP), how should the requirement in section  3132(6) that the 
Commission consider “public health and safety, scenic, historic and 
recreational values” be interpreted and applied?  Is the interpretation and 
application of this requirement different in the context of the NECEC as 
opposed to a reliabil ity transmission project?  
 
1. Positions of the Parties  
 
CMP, IECG , WM&R C, and IBEW argue that the Commission should defer to the 
DEP and the LUPC , with respect to issues relating to public health and safety, scenic, 
historic and recreational values , and tha t approval may be conditioned on future receipt 
of all necessary permits and approvals from such agencies .  CMP Initial Br. at 16-25; 
IECG Initial Br. at 14-15; WM&R Initial Br. at 14-15; IBEW Initial Br. at 3-4.  Sections 
3132(6), (7), and (8) provide the  Commission an opportunity to consider the findings of 
the DEP  with respect to any modifications ordered by the DEP and contemplate s an 
iterative process, if necessary, in which the Commission would review the DEP’s 
findings if it impose s additional costs on the project.  In this manner, redundant and 
potentially inconsistent project reviews by State agencies can be avoided.  
 
                                                           
9 The Commission notes that, even if an NTA could meet the identified public need, 
such an alternative could not do so at a lower total cost to Maine customers because 
Maine customers will not pay for the NECEC.  
 
ORDER   21  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 NRCM, CLF, Acadia Center, NextEra, GINT, and Caratunk argue that the 
Commission does not have to duplicate the specific responsibilit ies of DEP and LUPC 
and is the only regulatory agency that can adequately consider the overall impacts to 
Maine’s “public health and safety, scenic, historic and recreational values” in the context 
of a broader cost -benefit analysis.  NRCM Initial Br. at 4-5; CLF Initial Br. at 10-13; 
Arcadia Center Initial Br. at 3; NextEra Initial Br. at 4; GINT Initial Br. at 74-76; Caratunk 
Initial Br. at 9-11.  DEP and LUPC only focus on their specific statutory criteria,  which do 
not include energy market issues and ratepayer impacts .  Moreover, there is no 
language in the CPCN statute that authorizes the Commission to delegate its 
consideration of these statutory criteria to DEP.   Finally, the Commission , the DEP  and 
LUPC  are charged with administering different stat utes, and each agency is equipped to 
administer its duties with different standards of review.  
 
2. Discussion  
   
In the typical reliability project, the Commission would first consider whether 
there is a public need for the proposed transmission line.  Up on such a finding, the 
Commission would then review the other statutory considerations, including the need to 
mitigate impacts on such things as public health and safety, scenic, historic , and 
recreation value.  
 
To interpret the statutory language in the context of the current proceeding, and 
upon the assumption that the Legislature did not intend duplication among State 
agencies, the Commission examines the statutory authority and functions of Maine’s 
DEP and LUPC.  This examination reveals different type s of reviews undertaken by the  
various agencies .  While the Commission’s review of these statutory criteria is in the 
context of whether the utility has met its burden of showing there is a public need for the 
project, DEP’s review of similar criteria is d ifferent in that it considers whether the utility  
has shown that its project  (1) does not unreasonably interfere with existing scenic, 
aesthetic, and recreational uses, among others and (2) whether the utility  has shown 
that it “has made adequate provision  for fitting the development harmoniously into the 
existing natural environment and that the development will not adversely affect existing 
uses, scenic character . . . .”   38 M.R.S §§ 480 -D, 484.  The LUPC’s role is to 
determine, among other things, wheth er there is no alternative site which is both 
suitable to the proposed use and reasonably available to the applicant and that the use 
can be buffered from those other uses and resources for which it is incompatible.   
 
In addition, the statutory scheme gene rally contemplates that the Commission ’s 
decision would occur prior to that of the DEP or LUPC.   Thus, the overall statutory 
scheme can be read to contemplate that if the Commission does not grant the CPCN, 
such a determination eliminates the need for the DEP or LUPC to  conduct  their reviews.   
Accordingly, upon reviewing the applicable statutes together, the Commission finds that 
the evaluation of the NECEC by the Commission , the DEP, and LUPC are 
complementary and the evaluation of impacts, such as scenic and recreational values, 
can be accomplished without significant duplicating or overlapping reviews.  
 
ORDER   22  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Thus, the Commission concludes  that it is not appropriate for the Commission to 
defer to other agencies .  Accordingly, the Commission must consider the im pact of the 
NECEC on public health and safety, scenic, historic , and recreation values as part of its 
overall assessment of whether the NECEC is in Maine’s public interest . 
 
D. State Renewable Energy Generation Goals 
 
 The January 14, 2019 Procedural Order  asked parties to comment on the 
following:  
 
How should the requirement in section 3132(6) that the Commission 
consider “state renewable energy goals” be considered in the context of 
the NECEC?  
 
• Referring to the definitions of “renewable capacity resource”  in section 
3210(2)(B -3) and of “renewable resource” in section 3210(2)(C), should 
the hydroelectric generation to be transmitted over the NECEC be 
considered “renewable” for purposes of promoting “state renewable 
energy goals” under Maine law?  
 
• Referring to the “State’s goals for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
within the State” contained in Title 38, section 576, is this provision 
relevant to the consideration of the NECEC proposal and the associated 
hydroelectric power located in Canada?  
 
• Are there  other Maine statutory provisions that are relevant to the 
Commission’s consideration of “state renewable energy goals” in this 
proceeding?  
 
1. Position s of the Parties  
 
 CMP argues that, although the NECEC -enabled generation does not fall within 
the defin ition of a renewable resource or a new renewable capacity resource under Title 
35-A, because the NECEC energy will come primarily from dams with more tha n 100 
MW of production capacity, the Project will provide many of the same benefits as 
hydro electric power that satisfies Maine’s definition of a renewable resource.  CMP 
Initial Br. at 115 -125.  CMP asserts that t he NECEC is a substantial source of clean, 
reliable baseload hydroelectric generation that diversifies the sources of electricity 
production for all of New England, including Maine, and reduces the region’s and 
Maine’s dependence on natural gas -fired generation .  CMP argues, further, that the 
Commission may consider the extent to which the proposed Project will facilitate 
Maine’s achieve ment of GHG  emissions reduction  targets set for th in 38 M.R.S. , 
Section 576 (Climate Change Act).   CMP Initial Br. at 163 -165. 
 
 NRCM, GINT , Caratunk , and Ms. Kelly  argue that the Commission should not 
consider hydroelectric generation transmitted over the NECEC from Québec  to 
ORDER   23  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Massachusetts as a renewable resource for the purposes of promoting “state renewable 
energy goals ,” because it would not qualify as a “renewable capacity resourc e” under 
Section 3210(2)(B -3) or a s a “renewable resource” under S ection 3210(2)(C).   NRCM 
Initial Br. at 4 -7; GINT Initial Br. at 78 -80; Caratunk Initial Br. at 17 -19; Kelly Initial Br. at 
9-12.  I n both instances qualifying generation is limited to capacity below 100 MW for 
hydroelectric generators , while most of Hydro Québec ’s generati on portfolio exceed s 
100 MW .  In addition,  these parties argue that consideration of “ state renewable energy 
goals”  requires that the Commission take into account the goals as expressed in the 
Maine Wind Energy Act  and the Maine Solar Energy Act , arguing t hat the NECEC 
would make it more difficult for the goals of these Acts to be achieved.    
 
2. Discussion  
 Title 35 -A, Section 3210  governs Maine’s renewable portfolio standards (RPS).  
Section 3210(1) states : 
 
In order to ensure an adequate and reliable su pply of electricity for Maine 
residents and to encourage the use of renewable, efficient and indigenous 
resources, it is the policy of this State to encourage the generation of 
electricity from renewable and efficient sources and to diversify electricity 
production on which residents of this State rely in a manner  consistent 
with this section.  
 
The statute specifies “hydroelectric generators” as a “renewable resource ,” but limits the 
size of any RPS qualifying resource10 (except  for wind power) to 100 MW or less.  Title 
35-A M.R.S. §  3210(2)(C)(f).  Chapters 3 -A (Climate Change) and 3 -B (Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative) of Title 38 address State policies and programs specifically 
related to GHG emissions.  Chapter 3 -A establishes GHG reduction targets for the 
State, and Chapter 3 -B authorizes Maine’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse 
Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is a multi -state cooperative effort to cap and reduce CO 2 
emissions from electric generators.   Taken together, these statutory provisions in clude 
various renewable energy related goals, including supply diversity and reliability, and 
GHG emission reductions.   
 
 In addition,  the Legislature has found that in-state  hydropower makes a 
“significant contribution to the general welfare of the citiz ens of the State”  in that it is a 
“large -scale energy resource which does not rely on combustion of a fuel, thereby 
avoiding air pollution, solid waste disposal problems and hazards to human health from 
emissions, wastes and by -products.”   38 M.R.S. § 631( 1).  For these reasons, the 
Commission finds that the promotion of incremental hydroelectric generati on for import 
into the New England market supports the “state renewable energy generation goals” as 
set forth in  Section 3132 (6).  As enumerated in the sta tutory provisions  discussed 
above, these goals include promoting adequate, reliable, and diverse sources of 
electricity supply and GHG emission reductions.   
                                                           
10 The fact that hydropower facilities larger than 100 MW do not qualify for Maine’s RPS 
does not mean that they are not producing energy that is renewable.  
ORDER   24  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  
 The Commission also concludes that both the Maine Solar Energy Act, 35 -A 
M.R.S. § 3472 et. seq . and the Maine Wind Energy  Act, 3 5-A M.R.S. § 3402 et. seq., 
are relevant to the Commission’s consideration of “state  renewable energy goals” in this 
proceeding.   The Maine Solar Energy Act advances the goals of “[e]nsuring that solar 
electricity generation , along with electricity generation from other renewable energy 
technologies, meaningfully  contributes to the generation capacity of the State through 
increasing private investment in solar  capacity in the State.”   In furtherance of these and 
other goals, the Act creates a S tate policy of  “encourag[ing] the attraction of 
appropriately -sited development related to solar energy  generation, including any 
additional transmission, distribution and other energy infrastructure  needed to transport 
additional solar energy to market . . . for the benefit of all ratepayers.”   Similarly, the 
Maine Wind Energy Act creates a state policy of “encourag[ing] the attraction of  
appropriately sited development related to wind energy” and establishes Maine’s in -
state wind  goals of at least 3,000 MW of installed wind by 2020, and 8,000 MW of 
installed wind by  2030.  
 
 Thus, the question of whether the NECEC facili tates or hinders solar or wind 
resource  development in Maine is an issue when considering whether the NECEC is in 
the o verall public interest.   
 
V. ANALYSIS OF NECEC IMPACTS  
A. Electricity Market Price and Ratepayer Impacts  
1. Overview  
Based on the record in this proceeding , the Commission finds that the NECEC will 
result in substantial benefits to Maine electricity customer s because of the effect it will 
have on reducing energy and capacity prices in the wholesale market.  These market 
price b enefits accrue to Maine customers due to the  reductions in wholesale prices that 
will result from the delivery  over the NECEC from Hyd ro Québec  of a substantial 
amount of energy  and capacity into the Maine Zone at  the Larrabee Road Substation in 
Lewiston.  As a contractual matter, the NECEC will deliver energy to the M A EDCs.  As 
a physical  matter, however, the beneficial effects  of that  energy  will be realized directly 
by Maine consumers through lower electricity supply prices.  
 
As discussed below, the record demonstrates that market price reduction benefits 
will result from the NECEC, notwithstanding the divergence among the experts and  the 
parties with respect to their magnitude.  Moreover, the record demonstrates that 
benefits will flow to Maine  for a period of at least 20  years.  
 
In addition, the Commission finds  that the NECEC will enhance transmission 
reliability, and supply reliabi lity and diversity in the region, and serve as a hedge against 
high and volatile natural gas prices.

 2. Energy  Market Impacts  
a. Overview  
The evidence in the record in this proceeding demonstrates  that the NECEC will 
result in a reduction to wholesale energy p rices in Maine and across the New England 
region.  The wholesale energy benefits in Maine, as estimated by  the Commission’s 
expert, LEI, and CMP’s expert,  Daymark ,11 range from $14 million to $44 million dollars 
per year in nominal dollars, and the estimate d net present value (NPV) benefits over the 
first 15 years of NECEC operations range from $122 million to $ 384 million (2023$). LEI 
Report Figure 4. 
b. Description of the Wholesale Energy Market  
Maine is part of a regional electricity system and market operat ed and 
administered by ISO -NE.  The rules of the energy market are set forth in ISO -NE Market 
Rule 1.12  Energy prices in the ISO -NE market, referred to as “location al marginal 
prices”  or “LMP”, are comprised of three components: an energy component, a loss  
component, and a congestion component.  Suppliers of energy to the market are paid 
the LMP applicable to their location, or “node”, and entities that serve customer loads 
are charged the LMP applicable to the locational “zone” within which the load is loc ated.  
As described by the ISO-NE:  
Locational marginal pricing is a way for wholesale electric 
energy prices to reflect the value of electric energy at 
different locations, accounting for the patterns of load, 
generation, and the physical limits of the tra nsmission 
system ….  
An LMP is the price for electric energy at each load zone, external 
interface with neighboring regions, and the Hub that reflects (1) the 
operating characteristics of, and (2) the major constraints on, the New 
England transmission syste m at each area, as well as (3) the losses 
resulting from physical limits of the transmission system .  The energy 
component of all LMPs is the price for electric energy at the “reference 
point,” which is the load -weighted average of the system node prices … 
                                                           
11 GINT provided an analysis of the energy market benefits of the NECEC using 
Calpine’s UPLAN model during , but only for a single year of operation, 2023.  Bodell 
Dir. Test. at 22.  
 
12 Information relating to ISO -NE’s Market Rule 1 can be found at https://www.iso -
ne.com/part icipate/rules -procedures/tariff/market -rule-1 
 
ORDER   26  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 The congestion component of a nodal LMP reflects the marginal cost of 
congestion at a given node or external node relative to the load -weighted 
average of the system node prices.  The congestion component of a zonal price 
is the weighted average of the con gestion components of the nodal prices that 
comprise the zonal price.  The congestion component of the Hub price is the 
average of the congestion components of the nodes that comprise the Hub.  
The loss component of an LMP at a given node or external node r eflects the cost 
of losses at that location relative to the load -weighted average of the system 
node prices.  The loss component of a zonal price is the weighted average of the 
loss components of the nodal prices that comprise the zonal price.  The loss 
component of the Hub price is the average of the loss components of the nodes 
that comprise the Hub.13 
 Because prices paid to a generator/supplier for energy reflect the LMP at the 
generator’s physical point of delivery, or node, they convey to the generato r the value of 
its energy taking into account the effects of energy delivered at that node on losses and 
congestion.  In particular, if delivery of energy at a given node would increase 
congestion and losses, the LMP paid to the supplier for that energy wo uld be reduced to 
reflect those effects.  The intent of the three -part LMP, at least in part, is to send a price 
signal to incentivize generators to locate where it is efficient to do so.  
As noted by GINT witness Ms. Bodell:  
…The point of these prices as  calculated by ISO New England is to send a price 
signal.  And the price signal, if it's lower, says don't build here because we don't 
need you as much, and if it's higher, it says we'd like you to build here, with 
respect to generation.  And it can send t he same type of signal with respect to 
load if you're passing through the price.  So, the price signal that ISO New 
England calculates is meant to send the signal to create economic buildout 
where it's needed.   
… 
Generally , the highest prices occur at loa d centers.  So, I would expect 
Boston would have among the highest because it's hard to get energy in 
there ….   
Hearing Tr. at 125 -6 (Jan. 8, 2019) .   
Thus, i f there were no barriers to locating new sources of supply  anywhere in 
New England, nor any practi cal considerations such as proximity to fuel sources  (such 
as natural gas  pipelines  or, in the case of hydropower, water  sources)  then presumably

ORDER   27  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 new power plants and other sources of supply would choose to locate at the nodes 
where LMPs are the highest and with the least negative congestion and loss effects.  
However, there are such barriers and practical factors that drive location decisions by 
generators.  These considerations, toge ther with the LMP price signal,  influence where 
new plants will be sited.   If a new supply source chooses to locate at a point that results, 
for example, in an increase to the loss component of the LMP, that does not by itself 
suggest the decision was not economically rational.   
 
In this case, because the NECEC -enabled energy wi ll be paid based on a 
contract price, rather than t he LMP at Larrabee Road, the 83 D RFP process and results 
may also bear on the economic rationality question.  As discussed at the January 8, 
2019 hearing , the NECEC was selected as part of competitive soli citation process in 
which more than 50 bids from 46 different bidders were received.  Hearing Tr.  at 129  
(Jan. 8, 2019) .  The Commission presumes that the evaluation of the competing bids 
would have taken into account the relative economics of the various projects, including 
the energy value at the project’s delivery node given that, at least  with respect to the 
NECEC, is the energy market value the M A EDCs will re alize.  As noted above, 
although the LMP would be higher in load centers such as Boston, it wo uld be difficult 
and expensive  to actual ly site a new power plant in, or deliver energy to , those areas.  
Thus, in evaluating economic rationality, the analysis, either in the wholesale market or 
a competitive bid process, becomes one of tradeoffs among  various factors.   Finally, it 
should be noted that, from a consumer’s point of view, lower zonal LMP’s, i.e., more 
negative loss and congestion components, translate directly into lower prices for 
customers located in that zone.    
 
c. Price -Taking Resources  
A supplier bidding energy into the ISO -NE market will generally bid a price that 
reflects its marginal cost of production.  Resources such as the NECEC, which  have 
delivery obligations  and are paid pursuant to a pre -established contract, or resources 
like h ydropower  that have a low marginal cost of production, have the economic 
incentive to bid a low or zero price  with ISO -NE to ensure they will be dispatched.  This 
type of resource is described as “price taking” in that the resource will  commit to, or  
“take ,” the market clearing price , whatever it turns out to be  when actually dispatched .  
Price -taking resources lower the energy market clearing price by displacing energy from 
more expensive units.  
  The NECEC is likely to be a price -taking  resource .  As note d by LEI : “LEI also 
assumed that the shippers on NECEC would offer as price takers in the wholesale 
energy market in order to fulfill their contractual obligations to Massachusetts. ”  LEI  
Report  at 18.  By offering NECEC energy as a price -taking resource, HQUS can  ensure 
that the NECEC energy will be selected  before higher -priced resources.   
 
d. Analysis in the Record and Positions of the Parties  
 
ORDER   28  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 As noted above, analys es of the effect of  the NECEC on wholesale energy prices 
in Maine and the region were provi ded by Daymark and LEI.14  Daymark ’s analysis, 
which was conducted using its  AURORA production cost model , indicated  that the 
import of energy at the full 1,200 MW capacity of the NECEC transmission line  would 
reduce LMPs  on average by $3.70/MWh.   CMP Exh. NECEC 5 at 11.  Daymark 
concluded that these price  reduction s would s ave Maine electricity customers $44 
million per year relative to what customers would have paid  but for  the NECEC .  Id. 
Daymark concluded, further, that the NECEC would provide a  benefit of $496 million 
NPV (2023$) for Maine electricity  customers over the first 20  years of the project.  Id.  
 
LEI’s analysis of  the energy market benefits of the NECEC , conducted for  a 15-
year period using LEI’s proprietary production cost model POOLMod , also  indicated 
savings for Maine electricity customers , albeit at a lower level than Daymark’s.  
Specifically, LEI f ound that over the first 15  years of operation, the NECEC would yield 
wholesale energy cost reductions for Maine  customers of about  $14 million  per year, 
which equates to an aggregate benefit of $122 million NPV (2023$) over this period.  
LEI Report  at 31 -32. 
 
CMP asserts that the NECEC will lower wholesale electricity supply prices in 
Maine, and that this is consistent with Maine’s policy to encou rage the reduction of 
electricity costs for Maine customers.  CMP Initial Br.  at 29 .  CMP cites to the analyses 
of energy market price impacts on the record , including the single -year analysis of  
GINT, as evidence that  the NECEC will reduce wholesale and r etail electricity prices in 
Maine and throughout New England.  Id. at 30 .  According to CMP, the  models taken 
together delineate a potential range of energy price suppression benefits from the 
NECEC, with LEI on the low end at $13 million  per year in retai l energy price 
suppression ben efits, GINT  in the middle at $26 -$36 million wholesale energy price 
suppression benefits for the year 2023, to Daymark on the high end at $44 million per 
year in wholesale energy price suppression benefits.  Id. at 35 .  CMP di sputes the 
claims of GINT  and NextEra that NECEC will create material congestion in the ISO -NE 
wholesale energy market.  Id. at 36 -38.  CMP argues, further, that t he NECEC will 
mitigate the impacts of sustained natural gas price increases by inducing an av erage 
annual reduction of 54.2 million MMBtu of natural gas  and provide a hedge against 
temporary increases in natural gas prices.  Id. at 39 -40.  
 
The IECG states that there is no dispute in this proceeding that increasi ng the 
available supply of zero -bid energy into the ISO -NE market would provide energy 
market price benefits to Maine electricity consumers.  IECG Initial Br.  at 20 .  The IECG 
notes that, a s a generation resource with no incremental fuel cost, HQ’s hydroelectric 
power will be able to bid in to the ISO -NE energy markets a price of zero, allowing it to 
collect the locational marginal price for its output in all hours that it supplies energy.  In 
every hour that this occurs, the market clearing price will be lowered as the most

 expensive generat ion resource is replaced by a lower -cost generation resource as the 
unit that sets the market clearing price.  The IECG notes, further, that b ecause the 
market clearing price is paid to all successful bidders, regardless of the price that they 
themselves b id, this represents a price reduction for every kilowatt hour sold in such 
hours.  Id. at 21 .   
 
The IBEW argues t hat the LEI estimates of energy and capacity market savings 
are based on extremely conservative assumptions , but provide additional corroborat ion 
of Daymark’s conclusion that there are significant ratepayer savings that would be 
provided by the NECEC.  IBEW urges the Commission to make such a finding.    IBEW 
Br. at 3.  The City of Lewiston argues  that the NECEC will facilitate the transmission o f 
up to 1,200 MW clean hydropower generation to the New Eng land transmission grid for 
40 years and help to lower electricity costs.    Lewiston Initial Br.  at 4.  The  Chamber 
notes that, a lthough it supports the NECEC for a variety of reasons, the energy co st 
reduction benefits of the Project are particularly significant for Maine businesses that 
use a lot of electric energy and any prospective Maine business considering its energy 
costs.  Chamber Initial Br.  at 4.  Acadia Center states the region will econo mically 
benefit from the NECEC through expected reductions in regional wholesale market 
prices.  Acadia Center Initial Br.  at 3.  WM&RC also asserts that the  NECEC will likely 
provide lower wholesale market prices.   WM&RC Initial Br.  at 11.  Finally, the NRCM 
agrees that  the NECEC will depress energy prices in Maine ; however,  NRCM asserts 
that the NECEC could incr ease congestion, making it more costly for Maine renewable 
generators to reach the market.  NRCM Initial Br.  at 17 . 
 
GINT  argue s there is no meani ngful energy market price suppression benefit to 
ratepayers.  GINT Initial Br.  at 33 .  GINT  base s this position on a number of different 
factors.  First, natural gas price futures have decreased since the energy price impact 
analyses have been conducted.  Id. at 34 .  Second, GINT asserts that , because there is 
no meaningful requirement for NECEC deliveries to be incremental, price suppression 
will be minimal.   Id. at 35 .  GINT also argues that any  energy market price reductions 
would be negated by increases  to capacity market prices as generators submit higher 
capacity market bids in an effort to recover revenues needed to remain viable.   Id. at 39 .  
GINT assert s, further,  that the NECEC will increase “wasteful” line losses and 
congestion to the detriment of  Maine’s existing and future generation base.  Id. at 43 .  
Finally, G INT argue s that any energy market price suppr ession due to the NECEC could 
harm Maine generators, especially biomass and small hydropower plants .  Id. at 59 -60. 
 
 NextEra  asserts any energy benefits from the NECEC are speculative and 
limited in time.  NextEra Initial Br.  at 19.  A ccording to NextEra , the flexibility of the 
contract delivery terms  with the MA  EDCs  can affect when and how much energy flows 
over the NECEC, which in turn, impa cts whether and how much of the claimed energy 
price suppression benefits will be realized.  Id. at 21 .  Finally, b ecause the analytical 
estimates of energy benefits extend to only the firs t 20 years of the contract, NextEra  
argues that any price sup pressi on benefits from years 21 –40 are only speculative .  Id.

ratepayers.  Caratunk Initial Br.  at 4.  Ms. Kelly cautions  that there are no assurances 
that the NECEC will, in fact, lower costs for Maine ratepayers over the long term , and 
that the analyses conducted to e stimate the benefits are based on  assumptions.  Kelly

deliver ed over the NECEC .  Given the available capacity of the NECEC, t his obligation 
will require  energy to be delivered at a very high capacity factor.  Stated another way, 
energy  will have to be delivered in almost every hour of the year.   To ensure that it 
meets its contractual obligations, HQUS can be expected to participate in the market as 
a price -taking resource,  i.e., submitting a low - or zero -price bid, and taking  the clear ing 
price in all hours.  It is clear that the injection of such a large quantity of price -taking 
energy into the Maine Zone will have a materially beneficial effect on energy prices in 
Maine.  
 
Although the magnitude of these benefits cannot be measured pre cisely, the LEI 
and Daymark analyses provid e a credible range.  As noted above, these analyses 
indicate wholesale market benefits of from $14 million  per year (LEI) to $44 million per 
year (Daymark), with estimated NPV benefits ranging from $122 to $496 mi llion 
(2023$).     
 
With respect to the congestion issues raised by GINT and NextEra, the 
Commission finds that the record does not support a finding that the NECEC will result 
in a material increase in c ongestion in Maine.  The analyse s of both Daymark and  LEI 
indicate only small increases in the number of hours that either the Surowiec -South or 
Maine -New Hampshire interface would be congested.  Daymark Report at 25; LEI 
Report at 25.   In addition, the GINT modeling indicated no congestion at the Surowiec -
South interface and only modest congestion at the Maine -New Hampshire interface.   
Hearing Tr. a t 127  (Jan. 8, 2019) ; Daymark Reb.  Test. at 19.  Nex tEra, based on its 
initial mode ling, asserted that the NECEC would result in significant congestion.  
However,  NextEra subsequently acknowledged errors in its mode ling that render the ir 
results unreliable.  Hearing Tr. at 7-55 (Oct. 22, 2018) .  Finally, the Commission notes 
that, to the extent the NECEC did result in increased congestion and/or losses in Maine, 
this would result in lower wholesale energy prices in the Maine Zone.  
 
Finally, for the reasons discussed in Section V(A)(5) below, the Commission 
finds that the energy benefits resulting from the NECEC will not be offset by other 
factors, such as early reti rement of other Maine generators.  
 
3. Capacity  
 
a. Overview  
 
ORDER   31  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 The evidence in the record  also indicates  that the NECEC will likely result in a 
reduction to wholesale capacity  prices in Maine and across the New England region.  
The wholesale capacity market ben efits in Maine, as estimated by the Commission’s 
expert, LEI,  and CMP’s expert Daymark,  range from $1 9 million to $ 27 million per year 
in nominal dollars, and t he estimated NPV  benefits over the first 15 years of NECEC 
operations range from $ 223 million to $ 292 million (2023$).  LEI Report Figure 4.  For 
the reasons discussed below, however, capacity market savings from the NECEC are 
less certain than those in the energy market.  
 
As with the energy market, the capacity market benefits would accrue to Maine 
due to the substantial amount of capacity that could be delivered across the NECEC 
into Lewiston.  Bringing such a large quantity of incremental capacity into the regional 
market will tend to lower prices, given the simple supply/demand balance in the region.  
 
b. Description of Forward Capacity Market  
 
The ISO-NE FCM  is governed by ISO -NE Market Rule 1, Section 13.15  Pursuant  
to the ISO -NE Rule, FCM  auctions  (FCA)  are conducted each year to acquire capac ity 3 
years in advance of when  it is to be delivered.  Resour ces eligible to participate in the 
FCM include in-region generating  plants  and demand resources, and  imports  from other 
regions.   Resources are award ed CSO s when their offer price clears the auction .  
Resources may exit the market and relieve themselves of  their CSO by submitting de -
list bids in subsequent auctions.  Only new or de -listing resources may  set the auction 
clearing price.  All other resources are considered  “Existing Resources” and “take”  the 
FCM clearing price.  Pursuant to the market rules, t he NECEC would participate in the 
FCM  as an “Elective Transmission Upgrade ” (ETU) backed by a  “New Import Capacity 
Resource.”  
 
   As is clear from the record in this proceeding, the FCM  rules are complicated , 
and how they would apply to the NECEC has  been extensively debated  by the experts 
and the parties.   The t hree elements of the FCM rules that have been most debated  are 
(1) the Qualification, (2) the MOPR , and (3) the Competitive Auctions for Supported 
Policy Resources (CASPR).   Each of these is discus sed in more detail below.  
 
c. Qualification  
 
Before participating in a n FCA , a resource  must  go through a Qualification 
process  administered by ISO -NE.   With respect to the NECEC, which as noted above 
is both an Import and an ETU, Section 13.1 .3 of the ISO market rule s governs the 
Qualification process .  First, the rules require that an  ETU must  be built to a higher 
interconnection standard  than non -ETU resources.  This higher standard, which is 
referred to a s the Capacity Capability Interconnection Standard , or CCIS , is intended to 
ensure that  capacity  from an ETU  can be delivered into the relevant zone without 
                                                           
15 Information relating to ISO -NE’s FCM can be found at https://www.iso -
ne.com/participate/rules -procedures/tariff/market -rule-1. 
ORDER   32  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 relying on the system delivery capa bility being used  by other resources  in the zone that 
already have a CSO .16  Second , with respect to  a New Capacity  Import , the resource 
must demonstrate the reliability of the generation source behind the import  to qualify.   
This can be done by providing contracts for capacity for one or more years, 
demonstrating proof of ownership over one or more External Resources to back the 
Import , or ensuring that the  capacity it supplies to the New England Control Area will not 
be recalled or curtailed to satisfy the load of the external Control Area, or that the 
external Control Area in which it is located will afford New Engla nd Control Area load 
the same curtailment priority that it affords its own Control Area native load.17     
 
d. The Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR)  
 
The ISO -NE Internal Market Monitor (IMM) oversee s the FCAs to ensure they 
are conducted in a fair and competitiv e manner.   Pursuant to the rules for new entrants, 
all offers of capacity that are below t he Offer  Review Trigger Price (ORTP ) are subject 
to review b y the IMM  for consistency with the facilities’ costs.  This is known as  the 
“MOPR .” 18  The objectives of MOPR are to prevent the exercise of buyer -side market 
power and resulting capacity price suppression and to ensure that new resources are 
offered into FCM  on a competitive basis.   EXM Exh. 3 at 1.  
 
The ORTP  reflects t he IMM ’s calculation of what  a given capacity resource 
should require for compensation from the capacity market.  Prior to each FCA , the IMM 
publishes the ORTP for all resources.  Market Rule 1 , Appendix A , Section III.A.21.1.1.  
Pursuant to the  MOPR, any offer of capacity from a new facilit y that is below the  
applicable ORTP is subject to review by the IMM for consistency with  the facility’s  costs.  
As part of this review process, a facility  can provide information to the IMM that 
                                                           
16 On this point, CMP states:  
This interconnection standard is more stringent than the Minimum 
Interconnection Sta ndard (MIS) that is typically used for Section I.3.9 Approval.  
Unlike the MIS, which allows other generation to be dispatched off to permit the 
interconnection of the proposed new resources, the more stressful overlapping 
impact analysis that is performed  pursuant to the terms of the ISO -NE Planning 
Procedure No. 10 to satisfy the CCIS, requires that new generation be fully 
deliverable to a Load Zone (in this case Maine), without dispatching off existing 
generation within the same zone of interconnection .   
CMP Petition at 43.  See also  Section 1 of Schedule 25 of the ISO Open Access 
Transmission Tariff.  
 
17 Thus, should an emergency situation require the shedding of load to preserve overall 
system reliability, the external control area would not preserve op erations in its own 
control area by shedding load in the receiving control area first.  
 
18 MOPR is not a defined term in the ISO tariff.  It is the IMM administration of the Offer 
Floor Price and Offer Review Trigger Price collectively that is referred to a s the 
“MOPR. ” 
ORDER   33  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 demonstrates that its  offer is reasonabl e.  Based on this review  process, the  IMM may 
establish  an alternative “Offer Floor Price” which is the value below which the facility  
may not bid.19    If the  MOPR set by the IMM for a given facility is  higher than the FCA 
clearing price , the facility  would be prevent ed from  clearing in the auction.   
 
e.  Competitive Auctions  with Sponsored P olicy Resources 
(CASPR)  
 
In 2018, ISO -NE adopted rules related to  CASPR  to address the concerns about 
the participation of subsidized resources in the FCM.  CMP Exh. NECEC 48 at 1 .   
CASPR al lows state -sponsored resources which otherwise  do not  clear the primary 
auction due to the MOPR to acquire  a CSO by “trading” with an existing generator.20 
Immediately following an FCA primary auction, there is a second “substitution auction” 
in which the s ubsidized resource has an opportunity to buy out the position(s) of a 
resource (or resources) that was (were) awarded a CSO in the primary FCA.  Once the 
CASPR resource acquires the existing generator’s CSO, the existing generator must 
then permanently ret ire from the capacity market.  The subsidized resource then holds a 
CSO and receives capacity revenues as an existing resource for subsequent capacity 
auction periods, but the total amount of capacity on the system is unchanged, and 
prices remain competiti ve.  Fowler Dir. Test. at 9.  Additionally, as LEI testified, once a 
CASPR resource acquires a CSO in the substitution auction, it does not have any 
MOPR constraints in future primary auctions.  Tech. Conf. Tr. at  54 (Dec. 19, 2018) .  
 
Finally, as is the c ase with the energy market, prices in the FCM can vary by 
zone.  While not as granular as LMPs in the energy market, there are also locational 
pricing incentives built into the capacity market.  Market Rule 1 Section III.12 .  When 
constraints occur in Impo rt Constrained Zones, the capacity clearing price in the 
constrained zone will be higher  relative to clearing prices in the rest of the pool.  When 
constraints occur in Export Constrained Zones, prices in the constrained zone will be 
lower  relative to the prices in the rest of the pool.  
 
f. Analyses in the Record and Position s of the Parties   
Four expert witnesses provided  analyses of the NECEC  with respect to the 
capacity market benefits and the issues discussed above.  Daymark provided  estimated 
capacity market benefits for Maine and the region.  LEI provided an analysis of the 
potential capacity market benefits from the NECEC, and also provided expert testimony 
and analysis on the likelihood that the NECEC -enabled  capacity would clear the 
auction.   Final ly, witnesses for GINT and NextE ra provided testimony and analysis 
regarding the likelihood of  NECEC -enable d capacity  being able to  qualify and meet  the 
MOPR . 
                                                           
19  The terms “Offer Floor Price” and “MOPR” are sometimes used interchangeably.  
 
20  The capacity  offers of these subsidized resources do not affect FCA clearing prices.    
ORDER   34  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
   Daymark assumed that 1,090 MW of capacity  from the NECEC would qualify in , 
and clear , the FCM .  Daymark’s estimated capacity market price reductions for Maine  
averaged $50 million  per year during the first 8 years of the P roject, yielding a $312 
million NPV over the life of the P roject.  Daymark Report at 13 -14.  Daymark did not 
provide any  analysis  on the MOPR issue .   
 
LEI provided  multiple capacity market analyses.  In its initial Report, LEI provided 
its estimate  of the c apacity market benefits from the NECEC , assuming that  1,090 MW 
cleared.  LEI estimated that this would result in savings for Ma ine of $19 million per 
year, and  $223 million NPV over the 15 -year LEI study period.  LEI Report , Figure 4.   
Subsequently, i n a memo dated September 10, 2018, LEI provided support for its 
conclusion s about the  NECEC MOPR price , and the likelihood that, giv en this MOPR 
price, the NECEC capacity would clear the capacity market.  LEI MOPR Memo .  LEI 
also recalculated the MOPR price and estimated capacity market benefits that would 
result  for the entire New England region if HQ US were to  qualify a lower amount of 
capacity .  LEI Supplemental MOPR Memo at 4 -6.  LEI’s analysis of the benefits to the 
market region -wide indicated savings of between $2 and $3  billion NPV (2023$).  Id. at 
5-6.  This equates to approximately between $155 and $243 million (2023$) in bene fits 
to Maine.  CMP Initial Br. at 48 , fn. 143 .  Finally, LEI  highlighted a number of different 
ways HQ US might choose to offer different levels of capacity into the market based on 
an assessment of all options and  economic opportunities.   Id. at 5. 
 
 GINT  experts  testified that  there would be no capacity market price suppression 
benefits because the NECEC would fail the MOPR.  Fowler  Sur. Test. at 13.  Mr. 
Fowler’s testimony regarding  how the IMM would  interpret the provisions for setting the 
Offer Floor P rice indicated that  NECEC MOPR prices would  exceed future auction 
clearing prices.  Corrected Fowler Sur. Test. at 4. 
 
NextEra witness Robert Stoddard  testified  that the NECEC is unlikely to have a 
measurable change on capacity prices in New England becaus e HQ does not have 
surplus winter capacity and because the Project cost is likely to exceed the relevant 
clearing price in the FCA.  Stoddard Sur. Test. at 4.  Dr. S toddard’s MOPR analysis 
indicated t hat the NECEC’s minimum offer price would  not clear the market, “this 
capacity is far too expensive to clear in the primary auction of the FCA in the 
foreseeable future.”  Id. at 14 . 
 
CMP argues that NECEC’s participation in the FCM  is likely to reduce capacity 
prices for customers in Maine and New England.   CMP Initial Br.  at 44.   CMP notes that 
there is substantial evidence in the record that demonstrates HQ Production will have 
capacity to offer via the NECEC.   Id. at 46.   CMP argues that LEI’s  MOPR Memo , which  
establishes that the NECEC -enabled capacity will  clear in the primary auction , is 
reasonable and should be adopted by the Commission.   Id. at 50.   CMP notes that LEI’s 
method of calculating the  relevant  transmission costs more accurately reflects the true 
costs of the capacity resource because HQ TransE nergie, not HQ Production, will be 
responsible for paying the construction costs of the line on the Canadian side, and HQ 
TransEnergie’s transmission rate for firm point -to-point transmission service is designed 
ORDER   35  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 to capture the marginal cost of new transmis sion construction in Québec .  Id. at 53.   
With respect to energy costs, CMP agrees with LEI’s and NextE ra’s use of an energy 
opportunity cost approach, and disagrees with  GINT ’s claim that the energy cost factor 
must be calculated using the total cost of n ew energy generation capacity required to 
serve the NECEC.   Id. at 54 -55.  CMP notes that  the energy opportunity cost approach 
is the appropriate methodology to reflect the energy costs associated with the NECEC 
capacity resource because it is the most acc urate representation of the true costs of the 
resource, particularly in light of market conditions, which indicate that HQ Production is 
not building new genera tion for the NECEC;  but in the absence of the NECEC, HQ 
Production would sell its energy to othe r markets.   Id. at 56.  Even if the NECEC -
enabled capacity does not clear in the primary auction, and acquires a CSO through the 
substitution auction, CMP asserts that customers in Maine and in the ISO -NE region will 
still benefit.   Id. at 65.  
 
IECG argue s that  the LEI estimate of the value of capacity market benefits is 
reliable and should be used by the Commission as a basis for estimating benefits to 
Maine energy consumers.  IECG Initial Br.  at 28.  However, according to the IECG, 
given the uncertainty related to  the MOPR issue,  it may be prudent to discount the LEI 
estimate by  50% to reflect this uncertainty.  IECG therefore recommends that the 
Commission adopt a value of $110 million in benefits to Maine energy consumers 
related to capacity market savi ngs.  Id.   
 
WM&RC asserts that the  NECEC will likely provide capacity benefits.  WM&RC 
Initial Br. at 13-14.  WM&RC argues: “LEI’s ultimate conclusion was that, based on a 
range of conditions and likely MOPR estimates, the NECEC should not be constrained 
from clearing in the primary auction.”  Id. at 14.  WM&RC notes further that e ven if the 
NECEC does not clear the primary auction , ratepayers would not be adversely impacted 
and the Project would still yield net benefits to Maine’s consumers.   Id.     
 
IBEW argues that  that the LEI estimates of energy and capacity market savings 
are based on extremely conservative estimates, but corroborate Daymark’s conclusion 
that there are significant ratepayer savings that would be provided by the NECEC.  
IBEW Initial B r. at 6. 
 
GINT argue s there is no capacity market price suppression benefit to ratepayers.  
GINT  Initial Br.  at 9.  GINT notes that t here is no evidence that Hydro -Québec  has 
excess incremental generating capacity beyond what it is already offering into the  New 
England market.   Id. at 10.   GINT notes that Hydro -Québec  and CMP ha ve stated  that 
Hydro -Québec  would not need to construct any new dams or other generating capacity 
in order to provide energy under the Massachusetts contracts.   Id. at 11 -12.  Moreove r, 
according to GINT, the North American Reliability Corporation has projected a 
significant shortfall in Hydro -Québec  capacity levels by 2024.   Id. at 13.   GINT also 
asserts that , the Hydro -Québec  Minimum Offer Price would not clear in the  FCA and 
that LEI calculation of the NECEC MOPR is unreasonable.   Id. at 19.   GINT  assert s 
that the appropriate calculation should rely on the capital cost to build new generating 
capacity, and the capital cost to build new transmission on both sides of the border  
ORDER   36  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 and, t hat, if calculated this way, any capacity that could be offered through the NECEC 
would cost more than the market clearing price.   Id. at 22.  
 
 NextE ra agrees with GINT that  the NECEC will  produce no capacity benefits.  
NextE ra asserts that HQUS will be u nlikely to qualify in the capacity market unless the 
load in  Québec  can be curtailed on the same basis as the HQUS deliveries into New 
England , and argues that  CMP failed to submit substantial evidence demonstrating this 
to be the case.   NextEra Initial Br . at 20.  NextE ra also asserts that the Offer Floor 
Price for the NECEC would prevent it from clearing t he auctions.  Finally, NextE ra 
argues there has been no showing of a seller of c apacity over the NECEC for years 
21–40 of the P roject .  Id. 
 
NRCM agrees  with GINT and NextEra that  the NECEC will provide no capacity 
benefit because it is unlikely to satisfy the MOPR due to the significant out -of-market 
revenues it will receive by virtue of its selection in the  MA 83 D solicitation process.  
Instead , it is m ore likely that the NECEC would have to obtain a Capacity Supply 
Obligation through the new CASPR substitution auction, which would require the 
permanent retirement of an equal number of MWs of existing generation in Maine for 
the number of MWs the NECEC wished to clear in the FCA , noting that such  
retirements would result in some loss of jobs and tax revenues in the state.  NRCM 
Initial Br.  at 16 .  NRCM notes that, i n evalua ting bids into the MA  RFP process, the M A 
EDCs did not calculate capacity benefits for different projects because of the difficulty 
in forecasting capacity market prices and because the new FCM rules, such as 
CASPR, were likely to m ake it more difficult for state -sponsored resources, such as the 
NECEC, to impact capacity clearing prices.   NRCM argues that t he Commission should 
follow suit and ascribe zero benefits to potential capacity price suppression effects.   Id. 
at 16 -17.   
 
g. Discussion  
 
The Commission finds that the NECEC will result in capacity market benefits to 
Maine.  As noted  above , the NECEC must  satisfy the CCIS standard of the ISO -NE 
Open Access Transmission Tariff ( OATT), which will ensure that NECEC -enabled 
capacity can participate in the FCM.  In addition, the energy prod uct that will be 
provided by HQUS , which is firm d elivery of 1,090 MW of energy per hour in virtually all 
hours, is very much like a capacity product and is likely to require capacity to ensure 
that these firm energy delivery obligations will be met.  Furthermore, the Commission 
notes that HQP has recentl y added new capacity to its system (Romaine 3), and is 
planning to add additional capacity over the next several years, suggesting that it will 
have incremental capacity for sale over the NE CEC into the ISO -NE FCM.  CLF Exh. 14 
at 17 .   
  
With respect to t he MOPR issue, the Commission finds  the analysis and 
testimony of  LEI to be the most internally consistent and credible  and, thus, the 
Commission concludes that NECEC -enabled capacity is likely to clear in the primary 
auction .  Given these factors, HQUS wo uld have the ability to participate in the FCA 
ORDER   37  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 and, given the substantial revenue it would receive, would have a strong financial 
incentive to do so.  
 
However, the Commission also recognizes the uncertainty regarding the capacity 
market benefits.  As noted  above, the record reflects benefits for Maine that range from 
$19 million to $27 million per year.   Moreover, given the fluctuating nature of the ISO -
NE capacity market and related rules, any such benefits, even if certain in the near 
term, cannot be cer tain over the longer term.  Thus, the Commission concludes that the 
lower end of the range of benefits, $19 mil lion per year, for the first 10  years of NECEC 
operation, is a reasonable and conservative estimate of the capacity market benefits to 
Maine from  the NECEC.  
 
4. Reliability   
 
a. Reliability Elements  and Positions of the Parties  
 
There are two  distinct  elements related to reliability that have been raised in this 
proceeding .  The first is the degree to which transmission system reliability may be 
affected by the NECEC HVD C facility and the associated AC system upgrades required 
to accommodate it.  The second is the degree to which the NECEC  affects  regional “fuel 
security .”21   
 
CMP and NextEra have both conducted transmission system studies for the 
NECEC.  CMP provided  two studies: The “New England Clean Energy Connect 
(NECEC) Project Analy sis and Technical Report,” and the “New England Clean Energy 
Connect Surowi ec-South Interface Limits and Overlapping Impacts Study.”  CMP Exh. 
NECEC 3.  The Project  Analysis and Technical Report was conducted pursuant  to the 
ISO-NE I.3.9 process.  The I.3.9 process ensures that any changes to the  system , such 
as generator additions , do not have an adverse impact on the system.  The Overlapping 
Impacts Study examines  the NECEC to ensure that, along with identified  upgrades , it 
would  meet the CCIS .  These studies identify the system upgrades needed for the  
NECEC.  CMP Exh. NECEC 3; CMP Petition  at 40-42. 
 
NextEra also conducted transmission system modeling.  Based on it s 
assumptions that the NECEC would cause Maine -based generators to retire, NextEra 
witnesse s conducted a study of the resulting reliability issues  from such retirements.   
The NextEra  study  results, which  were provided in the surrebuttal testimony of Mr. 
Whitley, indicated a potential need for  future reliability upgrades  given those 
assumptions .  Whitely, Mayers, Wang Sur. Test. at 11.   
In its brief, CMP highlights transmission reliability benefits that it asserts the  
NECEC will provide .  First, CMP argues that the NECEC will add  important redundancy 
between the Québec and New England systems, which will better protect the region in 
                                                           
21 “Fuel security” is a term that is frequently being used within ISO -NE.  By its use of the 
term, the Commission is referring to the reliability, adequacy, and diversity of the fuel 
types behind supply resources serving the region.  
ORDER   38  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 the event of the loss of the existing Phase II intertie, one of the largest possible losses 
of supply in New England.   CMP Initial Br. at 94.  The additional interconnection 
between New England and Québec  would also allow both control areas to provide 
incremental emergency support in the event of capacity deficiencies (tie  benefits ).  Id. at 
95.   According to CMP, t he AC upgrades  required by the NECEC  will increase the 
transfer limits at the Surowi ec-South interface  from 1,600 MW to 2,600 MW.  CMP 
further states that the new 345 kV line between the Coopers Mill s Road substation and 
the Maine Yankee substation (Section 3027)  and the rebuilding of the 115 kV lines 
(Sections 62 and 64) out of Larrabee Road will add redundancy and additional 
transmission capacity to the transmission system across central Maine.  Id.  Finally, 
CMP argues that the addition al transformer at Raven Farm wil l improve reliability  in the 
greater Portland area .  Id. at 95 -96.  CMP also state s that t he NECEC  will provide 
significant fuel security b enefits  by delivering clean baseload hydropower to replace 
retiring resources in the  region and by reducing the regio n’s dependence on natural gas 
fired generation.  Id. at 83.   
 
The IECG argues that the additional capacity and fuel diversity provided by the 
NECEC will help to address a portion of the energy price spikes and reliability risk 
posed to Maine and New Engla nd by the lack of adequate natural gas pipeline 
infrastructure.   IECG Initial Br.  at 29.    
 
GINT argues that the NECEC  would make electric service in Maine less reliable 
by hastening the retirement , or preventing the development , of reliable generators und er 
dispatch control here in New England and replacing them  with less reliable power from 
Québec .  GINT Initial Br.  at 1.  GINT asserts that the NECEC would provide no reliability 
if it does not deliver incremental energy.   Id. at 63.   GINT notes, further, that because 
New England and Québec  experience winter weather at the same time and because 
Québec  is a winter peaking system, relying on energy from HQ in the winter may have 
risks.  Id. at 64.   Finally, GINT argues that NECEC c ould reduce the reliability of the 
ISO-NE system by inducing the retirement of a potentially fuel -diverse resource through 
the CASPR program.   Id. at 68.  
 
NextEra does  not refute the transmission modeling conducted by CMP and its 
consultants.   NextEra Initial Br.  at 25 -26.  However, NextEra argues that  CMP has failed 
to show that the NECEC will not have a negative impact on reliability in  future  years 
because it did not present any probabilistic transmission studies  regarding this issue.  
Without such  studies , claims NextEra , it is no t reasonable for CMP to claim there will be 
no reliability upgrades resulting from the operation of the NECEC.   Id.   
 
 NRCM argues that attention devoted by CMP to the NECEC could strain CMP 
resources and result in less reliability and diminished  ratepaye r experience .  NRCM 
Initial Br.  at 20.   NRCM also notes that, i f the NECEC were to substitute for one or 
more of these (Maine) generators through CASPR, in -state resources with stored fuel

fuel security.    Id. at 21.

 b. Discussion  
 
The Commission finds that the NECEC and associated upgrades will increase 
the reliability of the Maine transmission system.  As noted above, becau se of the 
requirement that the P roject meet the  CCIS, the overlapping impact test requires that 
the NECEC must not erode the capacity deliverability of other resources in the Maine 
Zone.  Because the overlapping impact test requires all of the generators with a CSO in 
the same zone to be “turned on” at  their full output before  the impact of  the NECEC is 
modeled, any system upgrades necessary to ensure that the NECEC, as well as all of 
the other resources with CSOs in Maine, can operate at full output without being 
curtailed are the responsibility of the  NECEC.  Because, in reality, the system rarely 
operates this way, the system upgrades required by (and provided by) the NECEC will 
provide extra redundancy and reliability to the Maine system during normal operations 
modes.  
   
The Commission finds that NextEra’s assertion s about the  potential adverse 
impact s of the NECEC 5-10 years in the future is not persuasive.  As noted above, 
NextEra’ s position reflects its assumed retirement of one or more Maine generators, the 
retirement  of which  is not indicated b y the modeling done by LEI or Daymark.  
Moreover, the Commission notes that the NextEra witnesses admitted that NECEC 
system upgrades would resolve the N -1 reliability problems their study revealed. 
Hearing Tr. at 71-74 (Oct. 22, 2018) . 
 
The Commission not es, further, that seven Maine generation facilities totaling 
1,370 MW in capacity, including those cited by GINT and NextEra as “at risk ” due to the 
NECEC,  had already  submitted de -list bids in FCA 13 that were accepted by the ISO -
NE.22  Had the de -listing of any of these facilities created the type of reliability problem  
that is here asserted by NextEra, the se de-list bid s would never  have been accepted by 
the ISO -NE.    
  
With respect to “fuel security,”  the Commission concludes that the addition of this 
interconnection to Québec , and the substantial amounts of baseload hydroelectric 
energy it will enable , will enhance supply reliability and supply diversity in Maine and the 
region.  The Commission notes that there are significant challenges to siting new 
energy i nfrastructure in the region,  as is evidenced by local opposition to natural gas 
pipeline and electric transmission projects.  At the same time, natural gas supplies from 
remaining gas fields offshore of Nova Scotia have diminished, and most of the s upply 
from that region is expected to be gone by 2020.  CMP Exh. NECEC 45 at 23.  The 
Commission notes, further, that  in response to fuel security concerns stemming from the 
potential loss of existing generators in the region, such as the Mystic Units 8 an d 9 in 
Massachusetts, the ISO -NE is taking steps to prevent their retirement through

With respect to fuel diversity, the region’s dependence on natur al gas presents 
serious challenges and risks, such as exposure to price spikes and concerns about 
supply adequacy in the winter periods.  In an effor t to address these concerns,  ISO-NE 
has adopted various market rule changes over the past few years, such a s Pay for 
Performance and the Winter Reliability Program.   Excerpts from ISO -NE filings and 
presentations on t hese matters are provided below.

Performance Incentives Changes  
Indeed, as full y detailed in the testimony of Peter Brandien, the ISO’s Vice 
President of  Operations, the ISO has observed and documented pervasive and 
worsening performance  problems among the existing generation fleet in New 
England.  These problems, which are not  limited to a single resource or fuel type, 
fall into three general categories.   First, the region’s  growing dependence on 
natural gas leaves it extremely vulnerable to interruptions in gas supply,  which 
can occur with little notice and which can affect multiple  generators 
simultaneously.   Second, a significant portion of New England’s oil and coal units 
cannot provide reliable backup  when gas problems arise due to increased outage 
rates, start -up problems, and other operational  difficulties.  Third, across the 
entire fleet, the ISO is observing increasing outage rates, poor  responses to 
contingencies, and a host of other issues, such as failure to maintain liquid oil  
inventory, mothballing dual fuel capability, and inadequate staffing.  
 
From the June 28, 2013 fil ing for the Winter 2013 -2014 Reliability Program  
-  ER13 -1851 -000 
In the last few years, the ISO and stakeholders have identified a number of 
strategic risks .  Two of these risks – related to New England’s increased reliance 
on natural gas -fueled  generatio n and to resource performance during periods of 
stressed system conditions – are most  pressing, and the region is working on a 
number of solutions to address these concerns.  For example, the ISO has 
implemented a change in Day -Ahead Energy Market timing a nd is making  filings 
to improve offer flexibility and amend the reserve market.  In addition, review of 
two sets  of ISO -proposed revisions to the Forward Capacity Market (“FCM”) rules 
is or will be underway  with stakeholders.  These proposed revisions aim to 
tighten the shortage event trigger and to  redesign market incentives and, at the 
conclusion of the stakeholder processes, will likely be  filed with the Commission 
later this year.   The ISO intends that the proposed changes to FCM to redesign 
market ince ntives will  directly address the gas dependence and resource 
performance issues discussed herein.  This FCM performance incentive proposal 
is planned for implementation for the 2018 -2019 Capacity  Commitment Period .  
As a transition between the Winter Relia bility Project and the FCM  performance 
incentives project, the ISO intends to propose a scaled -down version of the 
ORDER   41  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 performance incentives project to purchase a fuel -neutral, winter -based reliability 
product for the  winters of 2014 -15 through 2017 -18. 
From the ISO March 6, 2018 Markets Committee meeting presentation on 
“Winter Energy Security Improvements: Market Based Approaches.”  
In accordance with FERC’s July 2, 2 018 order in EL18 -182-000, the ISO must 
develop and file improvements to its market design to  better address regional 
fuel security . 
 
Finally, as noted above, f uel security has been a growing issue in the ISO -NE 
region such that it has become a subset of system reliability  as viewed by ISO -NE and 
the FERC .  The Commission points to the  Operational  Fuel Security Analysis  provided 
by ISO -NE in January 2018.  This analysis was later adopted by FERC in its fuel 
security order.  Order Denying Waiver Request, FERC Dockets ER18 -1509 -000, EL18 -
182-000 (July 2, 2018).  The study conclusions state: “The study indicates that over the 
next several decades, New England’s power system will largely depend on the 
availability of two key elements, sufficient injections of LNG and electricity imports from 
neighboring regions.”  The Commission recognizes that there may be challenges 
associated with  depending on imports , but given the difficulty that the region faces in  
terms of  siting any energy infrastructure , the ISO NE’s conclusion s regarding the future  
are compelling .  Thus, in this case, the Commission is  presented with a transmission 
line that will provide a pathway to import up to 1 ,200 MW at no cost to Maine and will 
provide significant mitigation for the issues identified in Operational Fuel Security 
Analysis. Because fuel security,  through FERC jurisdiction and its ruling on the Mystic 
Units , has been determined to be  a regional issue and , thus, the costs to address it  are 
socialized across the region , if a significant import line is not built now, it will  likely  be 
built later , the costs for which are likely to be treated in a way that is  much less 
favorable to Maine  than the NECEC . 
 
5. Effect of the NECEC on New and Existing Generators in      
 Maine  
a. Overview  
There have been three questions  raised in this  proceeding related to potential 
adverse effects on new an d existing generators in Maine result ing from the NECEC.  
First, whether  the NECEC would result in reductions to energy prices in Maine which, in 
turn, would reduce revenues for in -state generators.  Second,  whether,  by its 
participation in the CASPR, the NECEC would cause existing Maine generators to 
retire.  Third, with  respect to new generators, whether  the NECEC would “use up” the 
existing transfer capacity “headroom” at the Surowiec -South interface, thereby 
rendering that transfer capacity unavailable to new generators seeking to locate in 
Maine.  
b. Positions of the Parties  
ORDER   42  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 GINT and NextEra argue that the NECEC, because of its effect on wholesale 
energy prices in Maine, will cause in -state generating plants to be more likely to retire.23 
In addition, GIN T and NRCM note that because i t is likely that NECEC would have to 
obtain a CSO  through the new CASPR substitution auction, the NECEC would result in  
permanent retirement of an equal number of MWs of existing generation in Maine for 
the number of MWs the N ECEC wished to clear in the auction.  The se parties note that 
such  retirements would result in a loss of jobs and tax revenues in the State.  GINT 
Initial Br. at 53; NRCM  Initial Br.  at 16.  
 
On these points, CMP notes that the analyses of both LEI and Daym ark do not 
indicate that the NECEC will result in any early retirement of Maine generators.  CMP 
Initial Br.  at 131 -132.  CMP notes that th ese results  make sense, given the low capacity 
factors of the units.  Id at 132.   In addition, CMP cites to evidence in the record that 
certain Maine generators, most notably the Wyman units, are already at risk of 
retirement for reasons en tirely unrelated to the NECEC, i ncluding their location, age, 
and the significant financial risks they face under ISO -NE’s new Pay fo r Performance 
rules.24  Id at 134.   
 
The IECG agrees with CMP in  regard  to the tenuous position of the Maine 
generators today, due to their poor capacity factors and low revenues.  IECG Initial Br. 
at 32.  IECG observes, further, that, with respect to prop erty tax revenues, the facilities 
most at risk contribute only $5.5 million per year, which is substantially less than the 
estimated property tax revenues of $18.4 million from the NECEC.   Id.    
 
In addition, several parties have raised concerns related t o potential new 
generators in Maine.   RENEW  argues that, if  NECEC capacity were to  absorb existing  
transfer capacity “headroom ,” the Commission should condition any approval on (1) 
CMP increasing the Surowi ec-South interface by the full 1,000 MW as planned  
regardless of whether ISO -NE finds a lower amount would be satisfactory, and (2) 
requiring  that HQ seek qualification of a lower amount of capacity.   RENEW  Initial Br.  at 
5.  On this point, GINT argues that  the NECEC would “fill the headroom at Surow iec-
South, increasing the expense of transmission development for Maine renewables.”  
GINT Initial Br.  at 60 .  
 
Acadia  Center , CLF, and NRCM share these concerns, noting that the  NECEC 
could  hinder the development of new M aine-based renewable resources by consu ming 
spare transmissi on system transfer capability.  Acadia  Center Initial Br. at 4;  CLF Initial 
Br. at 6;  NRCM Initial Br.  at 19.  
 
                                                           
23 GINT witness Bodell asserted the NECEC’s participation in ISO -NE energy markets 
would hasten Maine g enerating plant retirements, eliminating jobs and property tax 
base.  Bodell Dir. Test. at 40.  However, no quantitative analysis or modeling to support 
these claims was provided.   
 
24 As noted in Section V(A), many of these generators  submitted de -list bi ds in FCA 13.   
ORDER   43  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 CMP argues  that, on the contrary , the NECEC will not prevent the development 
of renewable energy in Maine.  CMP notes that t he NECEC will have no effect o n any of 
the proposed 765.5 MW of renewable generation that are ahead of it in the ISO -NE 
interconnection queue.  CMP Reply Br.  at 47-48.   With respect to other renewable 
generation projects, CMP argues that the NECEC -related  transmission system 
upgrades will actually benefit new renewable projects by increasing the transfer 
capability at the Surowiec -South interface and defraying system upgrades and costs 
that would otherwise be required of these projects by ISO -NE in order t o interconnect.  
Id at 51 -53. 
 
IECG argues that the decision regarding the NECEC should not involve 
consideration of negative effects on generators, new or existing , in Maine’s restructured 
market .  IECG Initial Br.  at 8.  IECG argues that generators are n ot entitled to, and 
should not receive, protection from the entry of new entrants in a competitive market.   Id 
at 10.  According to the IECG, the Commission’s decision whether to grant a CPCN 
must be based on considerations relating to electric consumers, not generators.  Id at 8. 
 
c. Discussion  
Based on the record in this proceeding, the Commission does not find that the 
NECEC will result in the adverse effects on Maine generators as alleged by GINT and 
NextEra.  With respect to the effects the NECEC will have on energy market prices, the 
Commission finds that, because of the already low capacity factors and energy 
revenues of these facilities, reductions in energy market prices are unlikely to be 
material for them.  The Commission notes, further, that othe r factors, including the ISO -
NE Pay for Performance rules, create far greater risks for these generators than the 
NECEC.  It may be, at least in part, that because of these risks, most GINT and NextEra 
generators submitted de -list bids in FCA 13 .25  Moreover, the Commission agrees with 
the IECG that, as a policy matter, it is the interests of customers, not generation 
competitors, that must be  the priority  consider ation  in deciding whether or not to grant a 
CPCN for the NECEC.  
 
The Commission a lso finds little merit to the concerns regarding the extent to 
which the NE CEC  may frustrate Maine -based renewables development by absorbing 
“headroom” on the transmission system.  First, as noted above, there is more than 750  
MW of new, renewable capacity  in Maine ahead of the NECEC in ISO -NE’s 
interconnection queue.  Second, a s also noted above, the Surowiec -South interface  
must be upgraded  to accommodate  1,200 MW of capacity  in order for the NECEC to 
meet the CCIS .  If, as some parties argue,  the level o f NECEC -enabled capacity will be 
less than 1,200 MW, the  available headroom at the interface may  be substantially 
greater than the  200 MW that currently exists.  Moreover,  for the reasons expressed by 
CMP and the IECG , the Commission finds  that “preserving ” headroom for potential 
future competing projects at the expense of a project in dev elopment is poor public

processes.  
 
B. In-State Economic Impacts26 
 
 1.  Economic Imp act Studies  
 
 In its Petition, CMP presented a study conducted by Ryan Wallace, Director of 
the Maine Center for Business and Economic Research (MCBER) of the University of 
Southern Maine (USM) that assessed the macroeconomic effects of the NECEC in 
Maine and New England using economic models developed by the Regional Economic 
Models Inc. (REMI). (USM Study).  The USM Study grouped the effects into three broad 
areas or time periods: development/construction related; post -construction, or 
operations, phase; and market price reduction related.  The USM Study indicate s that 
NECEC transmission infrastructure investments are expected to support a $573 million 
(2009$) addition to Maine GDP and over $440 million (2009$) in total wo rker 
compensation during the 6 -year development and construction period (2017 -2022). 
CMP Initial Br. at 70.   In addition, the USM Study indicates that the NECEC would 
support over 1,740 direct, indirect, and induced jobs per year in  Maine during that same 
period.  Id.  According to Mr. Wal lace, these construction -period benefits would be 
realized throughout the State.  Id. at 71.  During the NECEC post -construction, or 
operations, period, the USM Study indicates that the NECEC would support a total of 37 
jobs, 21 of which would be to mainta in and operate the NECEC and the remaining 16 
from indirect and induced spending.  Id. at 72.  Finally, the Study indicates that the 
NECEC’s energy market price suppression effects will result in over 260 jobs in Maine, 
on average, and more than $23 millio n in GDP and $17 million in total compensation 
each year over the 20 -year term of the PPAs.  Id. at 73.  
 
 The LEI Study included a review of the USM Study and an independent analysis 
of the macroeconomic benefits resulting from the NECEC.  In conducting i ts analysis, 
LEI used the same REMI PI+ software as USM.  LEI Report at 32.  As was done in the 
USM Study, LEI analyzed the macroeconomic effects during (1) the 
development/construction period and (2) the operations period.   LEI’s analysis reflected 
its pr ojected energy market prices (rather than Daymark’s), and included certain factors 
that were omitted in the USM analysis, most notably, NECEC capacity market price 
impacts, contract costs borne by Massachusetts ratepayers, and early retirement and 
deferred  investment in generation capacity triggered by the NECEC.  Id. at 54.  LEI also 
provided its independent analysis of tax revenue from the NECEC by munic ipality.  Id. 
at 37.    
 
                                                           
26 For the rea sons discussed in Section IV(A) above, the Commission’s focus is on 
benefits to Maine rather than to the New England region as a whole . 
ORDER   45  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  A comparison of the LEI and USM macroeconomic benefits is shown in Figure 
V.1 below:27  
 
Figure V.1 
 
LEI Report at 15.  
 As shown in Figure V.1, LEI’s analysis reflects employment and GDP benefits in 
Maine that are generally consistent with those reflected in the USM Study.  With respect 
to the broader New England region, LEI’s analys is reflects benefits that are significantly 
less than those in the USM Study due to LEI’s inclusion of the contract costs borne by 
ratepayers in Massachusetts, as well as early retirement of genera tors in Connecticut.  
Id. at 16.   
 
Both LEI and the USM St udy estimate approximately $18 million annual 
incremental municipal tax revenue received from  the NECEC based on the Project’s 
taxable value and the municipal mill rates in ef fect in 2016.  LEI Report at 64;  USM 
Study, Section 6.  As noted by LEI, the actu al tax payments from the Project will depend 
                                                           
27  CMP provided an update to the information in its Petition in which it estimated the 
number of direct, indirect and in duced jobs would be 1,742 on an annual average basis 
based on updated projected NECEC costs.   ODR -003-011, Highly Confidential 
Attachment 2.    
 

ORDER   46  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 on a number of factors, including the taxable valuation in each municipality, the budget 
plan and mill rates in each municipality , and the change in valuation of other properties.  
LEI Report at 64 -65.  Addition ally, tax payments from the NECEC are expected to 
decline as the taxable value of the project depreciates.  Id. at 65.     
 
2.  Position s of the Parties  
 
CMP describes the USM Study as “conservative” in that it does not reflect any 
potential NECEC capacity  market price suppression effects, nor any benefits from 
increased property and sales taxes.  CMP Initial Br.  at 73.  CMP notes that LEI’s 
analysis confirms that the NECEC will produce substantial jobs and increased GDP 
during its development/construction and operations periods, and that LEI generally 
confirms the macroeconomic benefits to Maine shown in the USM Study.  Id.  
 
GINT argue s that the USM Study overstates macroeconomic benefits and is 
unreliable.  GINT Initial Br.  at 61.  GINT points to the foll owing flaws of the USM Study 
to support its assertion: (1) reliance on Daymark’s energy price forecast; (2) failure to 
include the contract costs borne by Massachusetts ratepayers; (3) failure to include the 
effect of early retirement of or deferred invest ment in generation in Maine;28 and (4) the 
adverse effect on the touris m industry in Maine.  Id. at 62 -63.  Other parties, inc luding 
the NRCM and Caratunk, also dispute the macroeconomic benefits as estimated by the 
USM and LEI Studies, for reasons such as  overstated property taxes and failure to 
consider the effect of the NECEC on local economies.  NRCM Initial  Br. at 18-19;  
Caratunk Initial  Br. at 36-38. 
 
The IECG  observes that the USM and LEI S tudies show macroeconomic benefits 
for Maine that are highly consistent with one another.  IECG Initial Br.  at 31.  The IECG 
agrees with  GINT that, as a general matter, lost tax revenues and employment from 
shutdowns or cutbacks at existing Maine generators are appropriately included in this 
type of analysis ; howeve r, the IECG disagrees with GINT’s position that the NECEC 
would cause any such shutdowns or cutbacks.   Id. at 32.  Oth er parties, includin g the 
Chamber, Lewiston, IBEW, and WM&RC, support the Project due to the economic 
benefits it will provide at the loca l level through increased employment, property tax 
revenue, and eco -tourism opportunities . 
 
3.  Discussion  
 
The Commission finds both the USM and LEI Studies to be supportive of the fact 
that positive and substantial direct, indirect, and induced macroecon omic benefits will 
accrue to Maine from the development, construction, and operation of the NECEC. 
Although the numbers of jobs and dollar increases in GDP cannot be precisely 
quantified, the Commission finds that the range reflected by the USM and LEI Stu dies 
                                                           
28 The LEI Study, which does include the effects of the NECEC on generator retirement, 
concludes that most of the  impact will be on generators in other st ates, and there would 
be only a  minor  impact in Maine.  LEI Report at 35.  
ORDER   47  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 provides a reasonable estimate.  Moreover, the Commission agrees with the 
observation of CMP that a $1 billion investment in a project located entirely in Maine, 
with the resulting employment and taxes it will produce, would result in substantial 
macr oeconomic benefits to the State.  CMP Initial Br.  at 32.  With respect to offsetting 
negative impacts due to premature shutdowns or cutbacks of Maine generators, for the 
reasons discussed in Section V(A)(5) above , the Commission finds that such shutdowns 
or cutbacks, if they occur, are not attributable to the NECEC.  And, with respect to 
deferral of investment, the Commission notes that, according to the LEI Study, any such 
deferrals would affect new investment in Massachusetts, not Maine.  LEI Report at 63 .   
Finally, as will be discussed in Section V(D) below, the NECEC will have an adverse 
effect  on scenic and property values, and local tourism and recreational economies,  
which cannot be quantified.  These adverse economic impacts offset to some degree 
the economic benefits of the Project.   
 
C. Public Health and Safety  
 
1. Background  
 
Section 3132(2 -C)(A) directs the applicant for approval of a CPCN to include in 
its petition, among other things, “[a]  description of the effect of the proposed 
transmission line on public health and safety.”  Section 3132(6) directs the Commission 
to, in determining public need for the proposed project , consider the project’s impact on 
“public health and safety.”  
 
2. Public Health  
 
In its initial filing in this case on Septe mber 27, 2017, CMP indicated it had 
retained Exponent, Inc. to conduct an electric and magnetic fields (EMF) study for the 
NECEC which would be submitted as a supplement to CMP’s initial petition when the 
report is completed.  On January 12, 2018, CMP file d Exponent’s report titled Modeling 
of the Electrical Environment, Report New England Clean Energy Connect 
Transmission Project  (Exponent Report).  CMP Exh. NECEC 16.  The Exponent Report 
presents the EMF levels and ion densities for transmission lines and  interconnections 
(1) along the NECEC route and (2) in portions of the transmission system in which CMP 
proposes to complete necessary upgrades.  
 
CMP summarizes the findings and conclusions of the Exponent Report as 
follows:  
 
Exponent found that the NECEC  HVDC line will produce static EMFs similar to 
those encountered in the natural environment, with magnetic -field levels similar 
to the earth’s static geomagnetic field and electric -field levels similar to those 
produced by atmospheric phenomena, weather, a nd friction charging.  Such 
levels are below the National Radiation Protection Board’s threshold that static 
fields above 25 kV/m may be annoying, and well below International Commission 
on Non -Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and Food and Drug 
ORDER   48  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Admin istration guidelines for static magnetic -field exposure.  Exponent also 
concluded that calculated ion densities for the project are within the range of 
levels encountered in the natural environment, and the new AC lines associated 
with the NECEC’s necessar y network upgrades will produce EMF levels that are 
well below the assessment criteria established by ICNIRP and the International 
Committee on Electromagnetic Safety.  
 
CMP Initial Br. at 122 -123. 
The scope of issues addressed, and conclusions reached, in  the Exponent 
Report received relatively little attention in this proceeding.  CMP argues: “In discovery, 
CMP made clear its intent to focus on EMFs as the only public health impact that CMP 
will be investigating.  No party has submitted any testimony cont esting Exponent’s 
findings or demonstrated any other health concern related to the NECEC.”  Id. at 123.  
 
WM&RC echoes CMP’s argument that no testimony has been presented in this 
case that contradicts the findings of the Exponent Report.  WM&RC Initial Br. at 16.  
 
Ms. Kelly argues that the Exponent Report is flawed and that CMP has failed to 
make a sufficient showing that the NECEC does not present risks to the public health.  
Referring to the Exponent Report, Ms. Kelly asserts:  
 
It is a narrow report that u ses models developed in 1983 to 1991 to determine 
static electric fields, magnetic fields and air ions associated with the operation of 
the DC and AC portion of the NECEC project.  There was no mention of 
experimental testing to validate the modelling, not  even on the AC modelling 
where the transmission lines are already in existence.  The report makes no  
representation about whether these values will be guaranteed maximum levels or 
even within an order of magnitude to the levels that will exist once the li ne is 
constructed and used over time.  
 
Kelly Reply  Br. at 8.  Ms. Kelly outlines what she considers to be additional flaws in the 
Exponent Study and concludes that CMP has failed to demonstrate that the NECEC 
adequately protects the public health.  Id. at 10. 
 
 The topic of the NECEC’s impacts on public health rarely  came up during the 
three public witness hearings that the Commission held in this case.  The most specific  
testimony on health issues relating to the Project was provided  by Julie Tibbetts , a 
medical technologist specializing in oncology and hematology.   Ms. Tibbets noted that, 
although the ill effects of living under high tension power lines is debatable, both the  
World Health Organization  and the Center for Disease Control acknowledge that 
increased electromagnetic fields increase the risk of various health issues, including 
heart arrhythmias and cancer.   The Forks PWH Tr. at 81 -82 (Sept. 14, 2018) . 
 
3. Public Safety  
ORDER   49  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 As with the public health issues relating to the NECEC, issues relating to the  
public safety implications of the Project  were addressed by only a few parties  in this 
proceeding.  Regarding the public safety issues relating to the NECEC, CMP asserts:  
 
CMP has committed to design and construct the project in accordance with the 
appli cable North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), Northeast 
Power Coordinating Council, Inc. (NPCC) and ISO -NE transmission planning 
standards and criteria as well as all applicable safety codes including the 
National Electric Safety Code (NESC ), the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) standards, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
standards, among others.  CMP’s lead engineer responsible for the design of the 
project, Justin Tribbet, also described CMP’s commitment to  project safety for the 
NECEC, including the retention of a full -time safety engineer tasked with 
reviewing the project designs to ensure that they comply with applicable OSHA 
standards.  No party has offered testimony demonstrating in any way that the 
NEC EC will be designed, constructed or operated in an unsafe manner.  
 
CMP Initial Br. at 123 -124. 
 WM&RC asserts that no party introduced evidence asserting or demonstrating 
that “the construction, operation, or maintenance of the NECEC will be inconsistent with 
applicable standards (i.e., NERC, NPCC, ISO -NE) and would jeopardize public health 
and safety.”   WM&RC Initial Br. at 16.   
 
 Caratunk raised issues relating to the host communities’ ability to provide 
adequate accomm odations for work crews on the P roject .  Caratunk also argues that 
CMP did not consider whether the affected communities in rural Somerset County 
would be able to provide adequate fire and emergency response services during the 
construction of the Project and after the Project is complete .  Hearing Tr. at 123 -124; 
126 (Jan. 9, 2019) .   
 
Similar concerns about whether local emergency service s would be able to 
respond to the potential public safety issues posed by the NECEC  were raised during 
the public witness hearings .  For example, Heathe r Sylveste r noted that the West Forks 
Volunteer Fire Department is small and primarily a volunteer department  and that 
members work full -time jobs out of the area .  Ms. Sylvester expressed her concern that 
potential medical, fire, or trauma events associat ed with construction of the NECEC 
may tax such small and primarily volunteer departments.   The Forks PWH Tr. at 12  
(Sept. 14, 2018) . 
 
 In responding to these concerns on behalf of CMP at the January 9, 2019 
hearing, Mr. Stinneford noted that CMP has existi ng transmission lines that traverse 
areas of Maine that are equally or even more remote than the NECEC corridor.  Hearing 
Tr. at 126 (Jan. 9, 2019).  According to Mr. Stinneford, there are CMP transmission lines 
that run through many unorganized townships that have no fire departments and no 
ORDER   50  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 public safety resources, noting that the public safety issues raised by Caratunk (and 
others) are issues that CMP is accustomed to.  Id.  
 
4. Discussion  
 
As noted above, issues relating to  the NECEC’s effect on public health and 
safety were not addressed by many of the parties  in this proceeding.  Based on the 
Commission’s review of the record, the Commission concludes that CMP has, through 
the Exponent Report and the written and oral testimony by Mr. Malone, Mr. Hodgdo n, 
Mr. Tribbet,  and Mr. Stinneford , satisf ied the filing requirements relating to public health 
and safety set forth in section 3132(2 -C) and provide a sufficient basis for the 
Commission to consider these issue s pursuant to S ection 3132(6) .   
 
In her Exce ptions, Ms. Kelly takes issue with the lack of attention to safety that is 
incorporated into the Examiners’ Report.  Kelly Exceptions to  Examiners’  Report at 2 -3.  
The Commission emphasizes that ensuring public safety with respect to public utility 
operati ons is a central purpose of the Commission outlined in Section 101 of Title 35 -A.  
That section states that the “basic purpose of this regulatory system is to ensure safe, 
reasonable, and adequate service.”  The above ground HVDC line is designed by 
profes sional engineers who by the nature of their training and licensure requiremen ts 
attest to safety when final stamping of the design occurs.  While there were many 
issues  in this case that were raised during the  18 months of litigation, this Order details 
the area s of disagreement of the parties  and makes findings with respect to statute.  
The Commission does  not agree that it is necessary in this case to have had hired a 
consultant on these matters when licensed engineers responsible for the design were 
witnesses and were available for cross examination.  
 
The Commission finds that, w ith respect to the safety concerns raised by 
Caratunk , Ms. Kelly,  and several public witnesses relating to the availability of fire 
protection and other emergency response service s in the proposed transmission 
corridor, the record reflects that CMP has adequately addressed such safety concerns 
throughout other remote areas of its exi sting transmission system.  The Commission , 
therefore , finds that the NECEC does not pose a threat t o public health and safety.   
However, it is evident that there are ongoing concerns about safety issues posed by the 
NECEC.  The Commission therefore directs CMP to, as part of its ongoing outreach and 
communications with the host communities, provide dire ct and clear information to the 
affected community about how CMP (1) has dealt with fire and medical support issues 
in comparable rural areas of its system and (2) plans to deal with fire and medical 
support issues in the context of the NECEC.   
 
D. Scenic , Historic, and Recreational Values   
 
1. Background  
 
ORDER   51  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Section 3132(6) directs the Commission to, in determining public need for the 
proposed project , “at a minimum, take into account … scenic, historic and rec reational 
values. ”  
 
 As discussed in Section IV(C) above , there is overlapping jurisdiction among the 
Commission, the DEP, and the LUPC regarding the review of such things as the 
NECEC’s impact on scenic, h istoric, and recreational  values.   Several parties in this 
case suggested the Commission defer t o the DEP and LUPC’s evaluation of scenic, 
historic, and recreational values.  For the reasons outlined in Section  IV(C)  above , the 
Commission finds that in the c ontext of this proceeding, it is required by statute to 
consider the specified is sues of  sceni c, historic , and recreational value s as part of its 
overall assessment of the benefits and costs of the NECEC.   
 
 To discha rge its responsibilities under S ection 3132 with respect to consideration 
of scenic, historic, and recreational values, the Commissio n must engage in a two -step 
balancing process.  Step one involves the Commission’s evaluation of the NECEC’s 
impacts on scenic, historic, and recreational values.  In this initial step, the Commission 
must weigh and balance the NECEC’s impacts to determine  whether the Project will 
have a net  beneficial or a net adverse  impact on scenic, historic, and recreational 
values.  Step two is a more comprehensive balancing activity in which the Commission 
must weigh its determination of the NECEC’s impact on scenic,  historic, and 
recreational values again st the other factors listed in S ection 3132(6) which include 
economics, reliability , state renewable energy generation goals, the proximity of the 
proposed transmission line to inhabited dwellings , and alternatives t o construction of the 
transmission line, including energy conservation, distributed generation or load 
management.  At the conclusion of the second step of the balancing process, the 
Commission will be able to determine whether sufficient public benefits  exist to justify 
the issuance of the requested CPCN.  
 
 In this Section  of the Order, the Commission focuses on only the impact of the 
NECEC on scenic, historic, and recreational values.  The more comprehensive 
balancing of these impacts and the other factor s set forth in Section 3132(6) is 
addressed in Section V(D)(5 )(e) of this Order.   
 
2. Positions of the Parties  
 
a. Scenic Values  
 
 There is wide  disagreement between the proponents and the opponents of the 
NECEC relating to the impacts the Projec t will hav e on scenic values.  To begin with, 
parties disagree over the current scenic value of the affected area.  Some parties argue 
that the proposed new corridor will run through a pristine wilderness, while others assert 
the area in question is more properly ch aracterized as a heavily -harvested working 
forest.   Parties also differ on the extent to which the Project will alter the current 
character of the area in question.  Finally, the parties disagree on whether CMP 
ORDER   52  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 sufficiently analyzed the scenic impact of t he NECEC and whether CMP adequately 
explored lower -impact options.  
  
i. Proponents of the Project  
 
CMP asserts that the NECEC is designed to minimize adverse impacts on sce nic 
values.   CMP notes that, where reasonably practical, the  NECEC is sited in an e xisting 
transmission corridor to minimize impacts, and where new corridor is needed the 
Project is designed to reasonably avoid environmentally sensitive areas and resources, 
including conserved lands, stream crossings, wetlands, deer wintering habitat, an d 
inland water fowl and wading bird habitat .  CMP notes, further, that a pproximately 73% 
of the NECEC route lies within CMP -owned, ex isting transmission corrido r, and that the 
remainder of the route is located on nearly all privately -owned, commercial fores t land, 
better allowing CMP to site the project to avoid adverse impacts on scenic, historic, and 
recreational values.   CMP Initial Br. at 124.  
 
 A major issue of contention in the scenic value debate is the current quality of the 
53 miles of new corridor.   On this point, WM&RC argues that, as  shown by the Natural 
Resource Maps provided by CMP in response to the September 12, 2018 Procedural 
Order, the land that will be the site of the new transmission corridor extending to the 
Canadian border are working f orests that have been heavily harvested in recent years.  
Thus, according to WM&RC, the transmission corridor should not unreasonably detract 
from the scenic, historic and recreational v alues offered by these areas.  WM&RC Initial 
Br. at 16.  
 
 Two other ma jor points of disagreement between those who support the Project 
and those who oppose it are whether CMP (1) sufficiently analyzed the scenic impact of 
the NECEC and (2) adequately explored lower -impact options.  CMP argues that it went 
to great lengths to  consider the impacts of the new corridor on scenic values and to take 
steps to reduce the extent of those impacts.  On these points, CMP states that it 
designed the Project to comply with DEP requirements  that a transmission project not 
unreasonably inter fere with existing scenic and aesthetic uses of resources within and 
nearby the project area, or Area  of Potential Effect .  CMP notes that, i n accordance with 
these requirements, it prepared a comprehensive Visual Impa ct Assessment  that 
articulates its methodology for determining potential visual impacts of the Project, and 
establishes clear mitigation strate gies for minimizing impacts.  CMP Initial Br. at 124 -
125. 
 
ii. Opponents of the Project  
 
The opponents of the NECEC focus primarily on the portion of t he line that would 
be constructed in the new corridor.  NRCM asserts that the route  of the NECEC would 
disturb 53  new miles of habitat from Beattie Township to  Caratunk , and would  clear over  
1,800 acres of land, cross 115 streams, disturb 263 wetlands cove ring 76.3 acres, and 
cross 8  deer wintering areas and 12 inland waterfowl and wading bir d habitat areas.  
NRCM Initial Br. at 21.  NRCM argues that  the NECEC is likely to have a permanent 
ORDER   53  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 and dramatic impact to environmental and scenic  resources, along the  line, most 
notably along the 53 miles currently undisturbed by transmission  lines.  Id. 
 
Caratunk asserts that the characterization by CMP of the 53 miles of proposed 
corridor as “working forest,” as if to say an already spoiled landscape, is dismissive o f 
local concerns and is untrue and disrespectful.   Caratunk Initial Br. at 11.  Caratunk 
notes, further, that clear -cuts in a working forest grow back , but the NECEC  corridor will 
not.   Caratunk Comment s on Stip.  at 8 (Mar. 1, 2019).  
 
Caratunk also argue s that CMP’s analysis of the NECEC’s impacts on the 
scenery along the proposed 53 miles of new corridor was inadequate .  Caratunk argues 
that CMP’s Visual Impact Analysis was insufficient, noting that the DEP found it to be 
“sorely lacking ” and “sent them back to the drawing board .”  Caratunk Initial Br. at 11 -
12.  Caratunk is also critical of the adequacy of CMP’s  consideration  of installing the 
proposed new line underground .  Id. at 11.  Caratunk asserts  that the relatively 
superficial analyses  CMP conduc ted regarding  Project impacts is extremely disturbing 
to the local communities and to those whose livelihoods and families are at st ake.  Id.  
 
iii. Testimony Presented During Public Witness Hearings  
 
 The disagreement over the NECEC’s impacts on scenic va lues was nowhere 
more apparent than during the three public witness hearings the Commission held in 
this proceeding.  Comments  were provided by those that supported the Project and 
disagreed with the proposition that the NECEC would go through wilderness t hat was 
pristine, including  by Richard B. Anderson, a former Commissioner of the Maine 
Department of Conservation and Executive Director of the Maine Aud ubon Society,  and 
Lloyd Ireland  who served as Maine's Director of Public Lands and also as State 
Econo mist during the 1980s.  Farmington PWH Tr. at 50 -51 (Sept. 14, 2018); Hallowell 
PWH Tr. at 109 (Oct. 17, 2018).  
 
 Other commenters offered a different perspective.  Former State Senator 
Thomas Saviello noted that, notwithstanding the fact that the new corri dor would be 
located in areas that are currently forested, the impact of the NECEC would be 
significant, noting that the NECEC clear cut corridor will not grow back.   Farmington 
PWH Tr. at 11 -12 (Sept. 14, 2018).  
 
 Speaking to the amount of logging traffic  currently in the area of the proposed 
new corridor, Jennifer Poirier testified  she seldom even passes a logging truck.  Ms. 
Poirier also echoed Senator Saviello’s comments about the permanent nature of the 
NECEC clear -cut in contrast to forest harvesting,  in which case the trees come back . 
The Forks PWH Tr. at 72 -73 (Sept. 14, 2018).  
 
 Many other commenters spoke with passion about the scenic value of the area, 
noting the significance of the area’s beauty, remoteness, and lack of development.  
Commenters n oted that these attributes not only contributed to their own quality of life, 
but were integral to drawing visitors who sustain the local tourist economies to the

 region.  Robert Kimber (Farmington PWH  Tr. at 68-69 (Sept. 14, 2018)); Drew Bates 
(Id. at 81) ; Todd Towle ( Id. at 46); Cecil Gray (Hallowell PWH  Tr. at 31 (Oct. 17, 2018) ).  
 
Finally, i n written comments that were read by Susan Percy, Field Rider stated,  
with some irony , that the remoteness and low population density of the area through 
which the proposed new corridor would run make it both attractive to tourists and 
vulnerable to projects like the NECEC.   Hallowell PWH Tr. at 156 (Oct . 17, 2018) . 
 
b. Historic  Value s 
  
 When compared to the Project’s impact on scenic and recreationa l values, 
the ef fect the NECEC  would have on historic values received relatively little attention by 
the parties in this proceeding.  In support  of the steps it took to consider the Project’s 
potential effects on historical values , CMP noted that it undertook a comprehens ive 
desktop review to identify historic properties potentially affected by the Project.  CMP 
noted, further, that impacts on historic values are undergoi ng a thorough review by the 
Maine Historic Preservation Commission and DEP.   CMP Initial Br. at 126.  
 
c. Recreational Values  
 
As with scenic values, there is considerable disagreement between the 
proponents and the opponents of the NECEC regarding the Project’s impacts on 
recreational values.  Proponents and opponents disagree on whether CMP adequately 
identified, and took reasonable steps to avoid, the Project’s detrimental impacts on 
recreational values.  Proponents and opponents also disagree on the extent to which 
the NECEC will degrade recreational values.  There is also marked disagreement 
between the  proponents and the opponents on whether there are beneficial recreational 
effects from the NECEC.  Finally, the proponents and opponents disagree on the 
NECEC’s likely effects on tourism in the new corridor portion of the Project.  
 
i. Proponents of the Project  
 
 CMP argues that it was mindful of the potential impacts of the NECEC on 
recreational values and that it took steps when designing the Project to minimize the 
negative impacts from the Project.  CMP Initial Br. at 126 -127.  CMP argues that  the 
Project route within the new corridor almost  entirely avoids sensitive recreational 
resources, such  as state and national parks , and that the r emaining portions of the 
transmission corridor contain existing transmission lines, thus,  the addition of the 
NECEC wi ll have m inimal impacts on those  areas.  Id. 
 
CMP asserts that it was receptive to comments about the Project’s impacts on 
the recreational values associated with the crossing of the Kennebec Gorge and made 
adjustments to the Project in response to those c omments.  Id. at 127.  CMP states that 
it is aware of concerns that have been expressed about the Project’s impact on the 
Appalachian Trail, but believes those concerns lack merit.  Id. at 127 -128. 
ORDER   55  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 While stating that the NECEC’s detrimental effects on the recreational values in 
the 53 miles of new corridor are not unreasonable, CMP further asserts that the Project 
will have positive effects on the recreational values of the area through which the new 
corridor passes.   CMP states that its “ siting of the NECE C will also facilitate snowmobile 
touring, one of Maine’s primary winter recreational industries. ”  Id. at 128 .  CMP points 
to this as a benefit to tourism in Somerset County  by strengthening one of Maine’s 
strongest recreational industries and the local e conomies in which the snowmobile 
riders spend time.   Id. 
 
ii. Opponents of the Project  
 
The opponents to the NECEC state that the negative impacts of the Project on 
recreational values of the host communities are undeniable and substantial.  On this 
point,  Caratunk notes that  installing 100 -foot-tall transmission towers along a new 
corridor as wide as the New Jersey Turnpike through relatively undeveloped western 
Maine will have numerous, significant, and permanent impacts.   Caratunk Initial Br. at 
10.  Caratunk describes th is conclusion as “self -evident.”   Id.   
 
The opponents to the Project contest CMP’s assertions that it  was (1) mindful of 
the potential impact of the NECEC on recreational values and (2) took sufficient steps 
when designing the Project to  minimize negative recreational impacts.  For example, 
Caratunk argues that CMP did not adequately identify or analyze the Project’s impacts 
on recreational values , describing CMP’s consideration of these matters as after -the-
fact and dismissive.   Id. at 13. 
 
  Caratunk also contests CMP’s claim that the Project will attract snowmobilers .  
First, Caratunk argues that CMP failed to do the analysis necessary to support the claim 
that the NECEC will promote snowmobiling in the area.  Second, Ca ratunk refutes 
CMP’s assertion that snowmobilers will be attracted to the new corridor.   Id. at 10 . 
Caratunk argues that, to the contrary, if given the choice, the snowmobile community 
will elect not to ride on a trail in the proposed new corridor.  Caratunk Reply Br. at 11-
12. 
 
Caratunk also refutes CMP’s assertion that it actively engaged the communities 
along the proposed new corridor and modified the Project design based on feedback 
from the local stakeholders.  Caratunk describes CMP’s efforts and analysis in this 
regard as unsupported and inaccurate.  Caratunk Initial Br. at 13.  
 
iii. Testimony Presented During Public Witness Hearings  
 
As with the public witness testimony on the NECEC’s impact on scenic values, 
testimony on the Project’s effects on recreational values  was quite divided.   With 
respect to CMP’s position that the NECEC provides recreational value benefits related 
to snowmobiling, Mr. Bob Meyers, who is the Executive Director of the Maine 
Snowmobile Association, Inc.  (MSA) , presented  testimony  in support of this proposition, 
noting that the entire length of the new corridor would be open to snowmobile access, 
ORDER   56  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 thus, creating significant new opportunities for Maine residents and non -residents.   
Hallowell PWH Tr. at 44 -46 (Oct. 17, 2018 ).   
 
 However, other m embers of the MSA testified that  such benefits are illusory.  For 
example, Tania Merrett and John Willard testified  strongly against the proposition that 
snowmobilers would want to ride under a power line.   Id. at 60 -61. 
 
Two other themes that were repeate dly addressed in public witness hearing 
testimony were the wild nature of the area and the broad appeal that the wilderness has 
for people.  Tony Diblasi , a registered Maine Guide,  testified  to the natural splendor of 
the region and the wilderness river tr ips he has shared with people from around the 
world.  The Forks PWH Tr. at 42 (Sept. 14, 2018).  
 
 Greg Caruso , a resident of Caratunk and owner of Maine Guide Services LLC, 
testified to his experience in guiding visitors who come to the region for whitewat er 
rafting, hunting, and ATVing  and snowmobiling.  In particular, Mr. Caruso noted that 
visitors come to the region to  get away from the modern industrial world , and that 
comments he has heard from thousands of visitors reinforce the importance of the 
region’s beauty , remoteness,  and silence.  Id. at 118 -120.  
 
 These comments were echoed  by other public witnesses  who articulated their 
concerns about the effect the Project would have on their own quality of life, as well as 
on the Maine economy.  Witnesses noted that the economic impacts would be felt not 
only in the communities in proximity to the Project, but also statewide, citing the 
negative impact the Project would have  on the “Maine Brand.”   Kate Stevens  (Hallowell 
PWH Tr. at 121  (Oct. 17, 2018) ); Monica McCarthy  (Id. at 67 -69); Beverly Hughey

3. CMP’s Efforts to Mitigate the NECEC’s Adverse  Impacts on Scenic, 
Historic, and Recreational Values Through the Negotiation of a n 
MOU with WM&RC  
 
a. Background  
 
CMP’s mitigation efforts relating to the NECEC’s detrimental effects on the host 
communities in Somerset County  have focus ed on CMP’s  Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU)  with WM&RC and the placement of the transmission line under 
the Kennebec Gorge.  On May 30, 2018, CMP and  WM&RC  entered into a n MOU .  
CMP Exh. NECEC 25.  In the MOU, WM&RC is identified as  
 
a Maine no nprofit public benefit corporation that was formed for the purpose of 
expanding conservation of the Kennebec, Dead, Sandy, Moose, Sebasticook and 
Carrabassett rivers; developing recreation projects; developing education 
ORDER   57  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 programs about the history, ecology and uses of Maine’s rivers; and expanding 
economic development opportunities along the rivers of Western Maine.  
 
WM&RC MOU at 1, Section C .  
 
 The MOU provides that “ CMP and WM&RC wish to establish a framework to 
mitigate any environmental, natural resourc e and community impacts of the Project and  
to provide additional economic development opportunities to Somerset County. ” Id., 
Section (D).   
 
 Section 4(a) of the MOU addresses the situation in which the Project crosses the 
Kennebec Gorge overhead and prov ides that, under such circumstance, CMP will 
provide WM&RC a lump sum of $22 million.  Sections 4(a)(iii) and (iv) provide a 
breakdown of the $22 million that CMP will pay to WM&RC in the event of an overhead 
crossing, and state that CMP will:  
 
 (iii) Cont ribute in a lump sum to the trust described in Section 4(c) $16,000,000  
to support and enhance tourism and outdoor recreation in the Central and  
Northern Somerset County, including construction, operation and staffing of  
a visitor center, maintenance of tr ails, funding of education programs to  
improve the local tourism economy; WM&RC commits to leverage these  
grant funds to obtain funds from philanthropic donations, the local tourism  
bureau, local businesses and other sources to the maximum extent possible.  
 
(iv) Contribute in a lump sum to the trust described in Section 4(c) $6,000,000 to  
fund maintenance costs associated with the tourism infrastructure described  
in clause (iii) above and for continued funding of education and other  
programs to improve the local tourism.   
 
 Section 4(b) of the MOU addresses the situation in which the Project crosses the 
Kennebec Gorge underground and provides:  
 
(b) In the event that the Project is constructed such t hat it (i) crosses the 
Kennebec Gorge underground, (ii) cro sses overhead at Har ris Dam, or (iii) 
completes the Project by any other overhead or underground crossing of the 
Kennebec or Dead  rivers, and subject to the Preconditions being met , CMP 
agrees to contribute in a lump sum to the Trust described in Secti on 4(c) to 
support the programs described in clause (a)(iii) above of at least $5,00 0,000, 
but in no case exceeding $10,000,000.  
 
The MOU provides specific instruction s regarding WM&RC’s participation in the 
regulatory review process of the NECEC.  
 
 At the req uest of CMP, WM&RC will provide written and/or oral testimony to  
one or more regulatory agencies with the power to issue one or more of the  
Required Approvals.  The essence and extent of WM&RC’s testimony will be that  
ORDER   58  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 the mitigation packages for the crossi ngs described in Sections 4(a) and 4(b) of  
this MOU are appropriate offsets to the environmental, natural resource and  
community impacts of the Project because the benefits of the packages to the  
region are substantial and long lasting.  
 
Id. at 6, Section 7(a). 
 
 In its September 27, 2017 Petition , CMP included an NECEC Communications 
Plan (Communications Plan).  CMP Exh. NECEC 9.  The Communications Plan 
emphasizes such things as keeping key stakeholders well -informed through early and 
frequent outreach ac tivities and building trust throughout the area where the Project will 
be built.  CMP Petition at 88 -89.    
 
b. Positions of the Parties  
 
The proponents and opponents of the NECEC are divided on CMP’s efforts to 
mitigate the Project’s detrimental impacts o n scenic and recreational values.  The 
proponents and opponents also differ on the sufficiency of CMP’s outreach activities 
and CMP’s communication efforts with key stakeholders regarding the negotiation and 
content of the MOU.  Proponents and opponents di sagree on the following aspects of 
CMP’s MOU with WM&RC: (1) the legitimacy of WM&RC, (2) the sufficiency of funding 
provided by the MOU, and (3) the adequacy of the way MOU funds are allocated.  
 
i. Proponents of the Project  
 
CMP states that the MOU “was t he result of extensive discussions with WM&RC 
representatives that began in Spring 2017 regarding the project’s river crossing at the 
Kennebec River Gorge and Moxie Stream in Somerset County. ”  CMP Initial Br. at 81. 
CMP summarizes the terms of the WM&RC M OU as follows:  
 
CMP has provided WM&RC with a $250,000 initial donation, and will, subject to 
the NECEC’s receipt of all relevant regulatory approvals, provide additional 
annual grants of $50,000 to WM&RC for five years, to support WM&RC’s 
charitable miss ion, including, in particular, the promotion of outdoor activities in 
central and northern Somerset County and the improvement of the current trail 
and track network in those areas.  To ensure that the NECEC does not 
unreasonably interfere with or adversel y affect existing scenic, aesthetic, 
recreational or navigational uses, CMP has also consulted with WM&RC on the 
design, construction, and ongoing maintenance plan for the NECEC in the 
vicinity of the Kennebec Gorge.  
  
As part of the MOU, CMP has also agre ed to certain measures regarding 
relevant, CMP -owned land in the NECEC project area, including to negotiate in 
good faith with businesses operating on land leased from CMP regarding option s 
to purchase such land, to consider making available for purchase l and that is not 
essential for CMP’s current or anticipated future needs, and to cooperate in good 
ORDER   59  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 faith in facilitating access to the NECEC corridor for recreational uses, co nsistent 
with applicable law.  In the event that CMP constructs the NECEC, the Com pany 
has also agreed to facilitate broadband, wide area Wi -Fi, and other enhanced 
communication services for the residents and business of Somerset and Franklin 
counties by laying an optical ground cable with multiple strands of fiber -optic 
cable, at CMP’s  sole expense.  CMP has also agreed to additional mitigation 
measures based on the NECEC’s proposed underground crossing of the 
Kennebec Gorge.  The Company has established and will fund an  irrevocable 
Maine charitable trust fund to support and enhance tou rism and outdoor 
recreation in central and northern Somerset County and contribute a lump sum of 
at least $5 million, and as much as $10 million, to fund maintenance costs 
associated with  such tourism infrastructure.  All of these provisions provide real 
and tangible benefits to Somerset County.  
 
Id. at 81 -82. 
 
 Other proponents of the Project assert that the benefits included in the MOU are 
substantial and provide significant mitigation of any negative impacts to the host 
communities in Somerset County th at may result from the NECEC.  In its initial brief in 
this case, WM&RC describes the provisions of the MOU and the benefits the MOU 
would provide to the people of Somerset County.  WM&RC concludes  that the record 
supports a finding that the various financ ial and non -financial contributions offered by 
CMP under the MOU will likely provide additional economic development opportu nities 
in western Maine and Somerset C ounty.  MW&RC Initial Br. at 8 -9. 
 
 The Chamber argues that the MOU will provide robust econom ic development 
opportunities for the promotion of outdoor  activities and tourism in that part of our State.   
Chamber Initial Br. at 5.  
 
 Regarding CMP’s broader outreach and communications activities, CMP 
witnesses were questioned during the January 9, 201 9 hearing about the adequacy of 
CMP’s implementation of its Communications Plan.  CMP witnesses stated repeatedly 
that CMP’s pre - and post -filing outreach efforts were robust, that the outreach team was 
committed to complying with the requirements of the C ommunications Plan, and that, 
knowing what it knows now, CMP would not change the way it conducted its outreach 
efforts.  Hearing Tr. at 115, 121 -122 (Jan. 9, 2019).  
 
ii. Opponents of the Project  
 
Opponents  of the Project are critical of CMP’s MOU with WM& RC on four 
fundamental grounds.  First, opponents question the legitimacy of WM&RC and whether 
it sufficiently represents the people in Somerset County who would be directly affected 
by the Project.  Second, opponents argue that CMP has not done the analys is 
necessary to quantify the damage caused by the new corridor.  Third, opponents assert 
that, notwithstanding CMP’s failure to conduct any analysis of the monetary damage 
caused by the Project, it is clear that the amount offered by CMP in the MOU (betwee n 
ORDER   60  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 $5 million and $10 million) is insufficient to offset the damages caused by the Project.  
Finally, opponents assert that the mitigation included in the MOU is not equitably 
distributed among those along the new corridor who will be most harmed by the Pro ject.  
 
Regarding the legitimacy of WM&RC, Caratunk asserts  that the WM&RC is 
simply  a shell organization created by CMP,  noting that the MOU also  requires WM&RC 
to proactively  support NECEC in front of governmental bodies .  Caratunk Initial Br. at 
38.    
 
Opponents also assert that CMP has not conducted a sufficient analysis to 
quantify the impacts of the proposed new corridor on scenic and recreational values and 
tourism.  Relating the lack of analysis and quantification of the harm caused by new  
corridor  to the adequacy  of the benefits package contained in the MOU, Caratunk 
questions how a proper mitigation package could ever be determined.   Id. at 27.    
 
In questioning the adequacy of the MOU’s funding for Somerset County 
residents, Caratunk notes the i ndefinite amount of funds being committed (somewhere 
between $5 million and  $10 million) and complains  that this uncertainty mak es it difficult 
to evaluate the actual value of the mitigation package.  Hearing Tr. at  75 (Jan. 9, 2019).  
Caratunk adds that t he MOU is structured in a way that places primary emphasis on the 
crossing of the Kennebec Gorge and further notes that CMP’s decision to underground 
that portion of the line substantially reduced the value of the mitigation package from a 
guaranteed amoun t of $22 million to a guaranteed amount of $5 million.  Caratunk Initial 
Br. at 38.  Caratunk asserts that this $5 million is insufficient to offset the damage 
caused by the Project to the people of Somerset County.  
In addition to the MOU providing insuff icient funding, Caratunk argues that the 
MOU is structured in a way that inequitably distributes those insufficient mitigation 
dollars.  Speaking to the mismatch between the beneficiaries of the MOU and those 
who would be most  harmed by the Project, Caratu nk argues  that funds should  be 
directed to where the direct impacts will be.  Id. at 27.  
In addit ion to its criticism of the contents of the MOU , Caratunk also criticizes  
CMP for its failure to include any Caratunk Town officials in any of its negotiations  with 
WM&RC regarding the MOU.  Hearing Tr. at 112 -113 (Jan. 9, 2019) .  Finally, Caratunk 
criticizes  CMP’s broader outreach and communications activities and its failure to 
comply with its Communications Plan.  Id. at 116.  
iii.  Testimony Presented During  Public Witness Hearing s  
 
Public witness hearing testimony relating to WM&RC and the MOU focused 
primarily on two issues: (1) whether WM&RC was representative of the affected local 
communities and (2) whether the MOU allocates mitigation funds to  the proper people.  
  
In their Procedural Order issued on September 6, 2018, the Examiners noted: 
“These public witness hearings are being held pursuant to Chapter 110, Section 8(B)(6) 
of the Commission’s Rules to allow persons who are not parties in this  case to present 
ORDER   61  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 testimony or argument to the Commission. ”  Consistent with the September 6th Order, 
no person testified on behalf of WM&RC at any of the public witness hearings .  But , 
there was a great deal of testimony critical of WM&RC and the MOU  regar ding each of 
the two issues.  Witnesses testified that WM&RC does not speak for them, some even 
expressing feelings of betrayal.   Ed Buzzell  (Forks PWH Tr . at 78  (Sept. 14, 2018) ); 
Julie Tibbetts (Id. at 82 ); 
 
 In the opinion of others, the MOU and the pro cess that led to it was described as  
a “done deal” put together by CMP behind the scenes.   Cecil Gray  (Hallowell PWH Tr. 
at 30  (Oct. 17, 2018 )); Former Senator Howard Trotsky (Id. at 160 ). 
 
 There was no testimony during  the public witness hearings that  explicitly 
referenced CMP’s Communications Plan or whether CMP had complied with that Plan.  
However, there was testimony about CMP’s trustworthiness, which  the Plan noted as a 
goal for CMP  to be achieved  through its outreach and communications efforts in t he 
affected communities .  Several witnesses spoke critically of CMP’s trustworthiness, 
citing presentations about  the Project by CMP that were “ deceptive” and meetings in 
which county commissioners and residents were told “half -truths”. Vaughan Woodruff  
(Farmington PWH Tr. at 34 -37 (Sept. 14, 2018 )); Beverly Hughey  (The Forks PWH Tr. 
at 130  (Sept. 14, 2018 )); Former Senator Saviello  (Farmington PWH Tr. at 7  (Sept. 14, 
2018 )); Eric Sherman  (The Forks PWH at 49  (Sept. 14, 2018 )); Kathy Barkley  (Id. at 
46); Pete Dostie (Hallowell PWH Tr. at 105  (Oct. 17, 2018) ).   
4.  Balancing the NECEC’s Impacts on Scenic, Historic, and 
Recreational Values  with CMP’s Mitigation Efforts  
 
In addition to evaluating the Project’s positive and negative impacts on the 
scenic, histo ric, and recreational values in and around the new corridor, and CMP’s 
efforts to identify and mitigate the detrimental impacts of the Project, the Commission 
must also bala nce the totality of the impacts and mitigation to determine the NECEC’s 
net impact on scenic, historic, and recreational values.  Not surprisingly, the proponents 
and opponents of the Project have different positions on how the Commission should do 
the balancing and  the re sults of that balancing activity .  
 
a.  Proponents of the Project  
 
The proponents note that S ection 3132 and Chapter 330 provide little guidance 
on how the Commission should weigh the various impacts of the Project and then 
compare and balance those impacts.  CMP describes the process as  “flexible,” 
reflecting the context o f the circumstances that exist at  the time of the determination. 
CMP Initial Br. at 8.  The IECG argue s that the public interest balancing t akes into 
account all relevant information contributing to the determination of whether the Project 
provides a posit ive net benefit to energy consumers.   IECG Reply Br. at 16.  
 
The IECG notes , further,  that this case presents many benefits and detriments 
that are difficult to quantify and weigh.  On this point, the IECG warns that “t he 
complexity of many of the issues r aised by the parties and the volume of such issues 
ORDER   62  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 have the potential to confuse the analysis and to obscure the value of benefits of 
NECEC that are s ubstantial and indisputable.”  Id. at 2.  The IECG adds that it  “is 
confident that the Commission and its staff have the technical expertise to  evaluate the 
record on these issues and to make appropriate findings, but the complexities are 
dwarfed by the indisputable. ”  Id.  The IECG notes that some issues are more difficult to 
quantify and argues that “rather than ‘wandering into the weeds’  to address these 
issues in significant detail ,” the Commission should stay focused on the more easily 
quantifiable benefits of the Project “ that are known to exist with a high degree of 
certainty.” Id.    
 
WM&RC echoes the I ECG’s comments about the complexity of the issues 
relating to scenic, historic, and recreational values and argues  that, with respect to in -
depth  assessments of the Project’s impacts upon the natural environment and existing 
uses of lands, the Commission s hould de fer to the Maine DEP and LUPC because  they 
are the agencies charged to make such evaluations and have the  expertise to do so. 
WM&RC initial Br. at 18.  Notwithstanding its recommendation that the Commission 
defer on such issues, WM&RC concludes: “ The Commission should find that any 
intrusions of the Project upon the scenic, historic and recreational values are not 
unreasonable and are outweighed by the benefits of the Project. ”  Id. 
 
b. Opponents of the Project  
 
The opponents to the Project make two fu ndamental points regarding the 
balancing of the Project’s beneficial and detrimental impacts.  First, the opponents 
assert that CMP has failed to conduct sufficient analysis of the NECEC’s detrimental 
impacts on the scenic, historic, and recreational value s associated with the Project.  
Second, the opponents argue that, in spite of CMP’s insufficient analysis, the record in 
this docket supports a finding that, on net, the NECEC is harmful to scenic, historic, and 
recreational values.  
 
Regarding the sufficie ncy of CMP’s analysis, Caratunk argues that CMP’s failure 
to adequately examine the Project’s impacts compromises the Commission’s ability to 
weigh and balance those impacts.   Caratunk Initial Br. at 42 -43.  Caratun k argues, 
nevertheless, that there is  evidence in the record that shows how  the NECEC will result 
in significant impacts to natural resources , and that it could cause economic  harm to  the 
local economy.  Id.  
 
NextEra makes a similar point, focusing on CMP’s failure to analyze the 
possibility of  placing the portion of the proposed transmission line from The Forks to the 
Canadian border underground.  NextEra argues because of CMP ’s failure  to provide 
any substantive evaluation of the scenic and recreational values impacted by NECEC 
for the 53 mile s of greenfield forested corridor, its request for a CPCN should be den ied. 
NextEra Initial Br. at 32 -33 
 
ORDER   63  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 On the other hand, GINT argues that t here is ample discussion in the record of 
the environmental harms that would be caused by NECEC, upon which the C ommission 
can render  a determination.  GINT Initial Br. at 75 . 
 
5. Discussion  
  
a. The NECEC’s Impacts on Scenic Values  
 
There was little discussion in this case regarding the portions of the NECEC that  
would lie  within CMP’s existing transmission corridor.   The Commission’s assessment 
on the Project’s impacts on scenic values therefore focuses on the 53 miles of proposed 
new corridor that runs from the Canadian border in Beattie Township to the Town of 
Caratunk.   
 
As noted above, s ome proponents of the Pro ject characterize the proposed 53 -
mile corridor as a heavily -harvested working forest that c annot be considered 
“wilderness .”  Some opponents  refer to the area in question as “pristine.”  The record 
suggests that the truth lies somewhere between these two characterizations.   
 
The proposed new corridor would run through a well -managed working forest.  
That fact is not in dispute.  However, the  record also confirms that this area has special 
qualities that are treasured by  residents in the area, as well as im portant to visitors that 
come to the area to recreate and enjoy its beauty, solitude, and remoteness.  
 
As the testimony indicates, well-managed working forests that are clear -cut grow 
back, while the proposed new corridor would be cleared and maintained in  a way that 
will not allow it to regenerate.  The NECEC would result in the clear ing of over 970 
acres of land and the transmission line would cross streams, impact  wetlands , and have 
an impact on the flora and fauna in and around the new corridor.  The av erage pole 
height along the new transmission c orridor would be 100  feet tall.   Thus, t he 
Commission finds that the Project will have a n adverse  impact on local scenic values .   
 
 The record does not allow the Commission to quantify the NECEC’s potential 
impact on scenic values.  However, it  is important to note that the NECEC’s proposed 
route is on private land which CMP owns or controls, including existing corridors for 
73% of the Project’s length.    With respect to suggestions that the line should be 
unde rground rather than overhead, CMP considered the overhead solution as 
potentially lower impact given the environmental issues related to burying significant 
portions of the line underground.  In addition, CMP  incorporate d the following design 
features to l imit the Project’s impact on scenic values:  
 
•  Adopting a perpendicular crossing to minimize visual impacts from approaching 
traffic, where the NECEC route intersects U.S. Route 201;  
 
ORDER   64  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 •  Distancing the transmission corridor from major access roads, and, where  
possible, providing for a vegetative screen between the corridor and access 
roads;  
 
•  Siting the NECEC in mountain notches (as opposed to atop mountain peaks) to 
minimize visual impacts for those in the area, where the project route crosses 
high elevation s, including in the area around Coburn Mountain;  
 
• Installing taller pole structures where the project route crosses Gold Brook in 
Appleton Township to allow for full height canopy and thus minimize impacts to 
conservation management areas associated with t he Roaring Brook Mayfly;  
 
•  Using “tapering” vegetation management methods that will soften the 
appearance of corridor visible from Rock Pond;  
 
• Using roadside buffers to mitigate visual impacts in the locations in which the 
NECEC will cross U.S. Route 201 i n Johnson Mountain Township and Moscow;  
 
• Using specific vegetation management practices to reduce impacts within the 
Kennebec Deer Wintering Area, rare species conservation management areas at 
Mountain Brook in Johnson Mountain Township and Gold Brook in Appleton 
Township, and Rusty Blackbird habitat areas;  and 
 
• Using sh orter, 75 -foot poles, i n the vicinity of Moxie Pond.  
 
CMP Exceptions to Examiners’ Report at 9 -11.  
 
Based on the record, the Commission concludes: (1) the scenic value of the area 
through which the proposed new corridor would run is substantial; (2) the running of an 
overhead transmission line through this area would have a n adverse  impact on the 
scenic value of the area; (3) the Commis sion i s unable to quantify the adverse  impact of 
the NE CEC on the scenic value within the area in question ; and (4) the DEP and the 
LUPC, the agencies with expertise in these matters, will conduct expert reviews of the 
scenic impacts of the NECEC and will, to the extent appropriate and feasible, mitigate 
these  effect through their own proceedings .   
 
b. The NECEC’s Impacts on Historic Values  
 
The question of the NECEC’s impact on historic values received little attention b y 
the parties.  As required by S ection 3132(2 -C)(A), CMP included a description of the 
effect the Project would have on historic values in its September 27, 2017 Petition .  No 
party in this case offered testimony on this issue and the issue was not directly 
addressed by any of the people who testified during the three public witness hearings in  
this case.   
 
ORDER   65  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Based on the limited record in this case on this issue, the Commission finds that 
the NECEC will not have a n adverse  impact on historic values in the area through which 
it passes.  
 
c. The NECEC’s Impact on Recreational V alues  
 
As with the Com mission’s consideration of the NECE C’s impact on scenic 
values, the  consideration of the Project’s impact on recreational values focuses 
primarily on the portions of the 53 miles of proposed new corridor  that attract tourists 
and outdoor enthusiasts .  The record indicates that the recreational activities that 
currently take place in the affected area are many and diverse.  A partial list of these 
recreational activities includes: fishing, hunting, bird ing, moose watching, leaf-watching, 
star gazing, hiking,  camping, rafting, tubing, canoeing, kayaking, snowmobiling, ATVing, 
skiing, taking photos, swimming, rejuvenating, and relaxing.   The record further 
indicates that visitors  come to this area to engage in these, or other, forms of recreation.   
Finally, the  record indicates that the beauty, remoteness, and undeveloped character of 
the region contribute to its value as a recreational destination.  
 
  The record supports a finding that the perpetually -cleared corridor, and the 
transmission line located i n that corridor, will  have a n adverse  impact  on the 
recreational values in the area in question  and, a corresponding impact on tourism and 
the economy in the host communities.  
 
As with NECEC’s impact on scenic values, CMP did not att empt to analyze or 
evaluate th e Project’s  impacts  on recrea tional values and the potential  effects on 
tourism and the local economy.  As part of its initial Petition, CMP included the USM 
Study titled “The Economic and Employment Contributions of the New England Clean 
Energy Connect in  Maine” ( USM Study ).29  While the USM Study  does  address several 
macroeconomic issu es relating to the NECEC, it does  not consider, or attempt to 
quantify, the effects of the Project on recreational values, or, more specifically, the 
micro -impact the Project  would have on the tourism industry in the host communities.   
None of the other studies and analyses filed in this case attempts to quantify the 
Project’s impact on tourism in the affected area.  Therefore, the record in this case does 
not include informat ion that would allow for the quantification of the NECEC’s impacts 
on recreational values and the Commission is left with the task of evaluating such 
impacts in general terms.   
 
                                                           
29 CMP Ex h. NECEC No 7.  The Execu tive Summary of the USM Study  indicates that 
CMP commissioned MCBER to “to estimate the employment and other  economic 
development impacts provided by the NECEC Project.”   USM Study  at 1.  Based on its 
analysis, MCBER found that “Maine ratepayers and communities will benefit from a 
reduction in electricity rates and the development, construction, and operations of the 
NECEC will support significant employment and other economic development impacts 
in Maine.” Id. 
ORDER   66  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Based on the record, the Commission concludes (1) the current recreational 
value of the area through which the proposed new corridor would run is substantial; (2) 
the NECEC will adversely affect this value; (3) the NECEC’s impact on recreational 
value would have a corresponding impact on tourism and the economy in the host 
communit ies; ( 4) the record does not support the assertion that increases in  
snowmobile riding or other recreational activity in the new corridor would offset these 
detrimental effects;  (5) the Commission is unable to precisely qua ntify the extent of the 
adverse  impact the NECEC would have on recreational values of the area in question; 
and (6) the DEP and the LUPC, the agencies with expertise in these matters, will 
conduct expert reviews of the recreational impacts of the NECEC and will, to the extent 
appropriate and feasible, mitigate these effect s through their own proceedings .   
 
d. CMP’s Efforts to Mitigate the NE CEC’s Adverse  Impacts on 
Scenic, Historic, and Recreational Values30 
 
There are two sets of issues relating to CMP’s mitigation efforts regarding the 
people of Somerset County.  First, the Commission must consider such things as the 
composition of the WM&RC, and if it adequately reflected the interests of  key 
stakeholders in Somerset County, and the extent to which some  stakeholders were 
excluded from d iscussions that resulted in the MOU.  
 
The record indicates that CMP’s negotiations of its mitigation package for 
Somerset County took place with a small number of people representing a relatively 
narrow set of interests.  Several key stakeholders, includi ng the Town of Caratunk, were 
not given an opportunity to see or comment on preliminary drafts of the MOU.  There is 
nothing in the record that adequately explains  the reason  for this omission.   
 
The second set of issues relating to CMP’s mitigation effor ts regarding the 
people of Somerset County that the Commission must consider relates to the specific 
terms of the MOU and the amount and allocation of mitigation they provide.  The MOU 
provides for:  
 
• A $250,000 initial donation and additional annual grants  of $50,000 to WM&RC 
for 5 years, to support WM&RC’s charitable mission, including, in particular, the 
promotion of outdoor activities in central and northern Somerset County and the 
improvement of the current trail and track network in those areas;  
 
• The c reation of an irrevocable Maine charitable trust fund to support and 
enhance tourism and outdoor recreation in central and northern Somerset 
County and contribute a lump sum of at least $5 million, and as much as $10 
million, to fund maintenance costs asso ciated with such tourism infrastructure;   
                                                           
30 CMP’s mitigation , outreach, and communications activities  discussed in this section 
address only the  process and outcome related to the MOU with WM&RC and the 
decision to cross the Kennebec Gorge underground, and do  not address either the 
process or outcome related to the February 21, 2019 Stipulation.  
ORDER   67  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  
• Options to purchase CMP land;  
 
• Access to portions of the corridor; and  
 
• Access to broadband, Wi -Fi and other enhanced communications services to the 
people of Somerset and Franklin counties.  
 
Although not part of  the MOU, CMP has also agreed to the underground crossing of the 
Kenneb ec Gorge as part of its impact mitigation in that area.  
 
 It is clear that the MOU provides significant and quantifiable benefits.  Less clear 
is how the funds from the MOU will ultimat ely be spent and who the primary and 
secondary beneficiaries of those funds will be.  It is also evident that the 
undergrounding of the Kennebec Gorge crossing has positive value, though it is difficult 
to quantify that value.     
 
 In addition to CMP’s  failure to include key stakeholders, such as the Town of 
Caratunk, in the MOU process, the Commission finds that  CMP’s overall outreach and 
communications activities regarding the Project  did not comply with  its Communications 
Plan, which  provides that “ it is essential to provide clear informati on, address any 
concerns, offer Project updates and build trust throughout the area where the Project 
will be built;” that “ interested members of the public want to feel engaged and have their  
concerns noted and valida ted by the Project team ;” and that such a strategy “ leads to 
the development of meaningful and valuabl e relationships built on mutual 
understanding, trust and respect. ”   CMP Exh. NECEC 9 at 2 and 8.   
 
When CMP witnesses were questioned about the adequacy  of CMP’s 
implementation of the Communications Plan, they stated repeatedly that CMP’s 
outreach efforts were robust and that the outreach team was committed to complying 
with the goals reflected in the Communications Plan.  Hearing Tr. at 115, 119, 121 -122 
(Jan. 9, 2019).  
 
However, the record includes substantial  criticism about CMP’s communications 
efforts.   The criticism accuses CMP of failing to provide some key stakeholders with 
accurate and timely information about the Project, failing to be transpare nt, failing to 
build trust throughout the area, and failing to develop relationships among the affected 
community that is built on mutual respect.   
 
 However, n otwithstanding this criticism, Mr. Dick inson stated repeatedly during 
the January 9th hearing t hat he is either “incredibly proud” or “very proud” of the 
outreach team and its efforts on this Project and that, in spite of this criticism, “I can’t 
point to a specific thing that we would do differently.”  Id.   Such a response suggests  a 
strong  discon nect from the views of  members of the host communities  and appears at 
odds with  the results achieved by  CMP’s Communications Plan.   
 
ORDER   68  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Thus, based on the record in this proceeding,  the Commission concludes (1) 
with respect to some stakeholders, CMP failed to comply with several of the core goals 
of its Communications Plan; (2) CMP ’s after -the-fact view of its success in complying 
with its Communications Plan appears unrealistic;  and (3) whether intentional or not, 
CMP’s failure to reach out to, and communic ate with, certain key stakeholders 
compromised those stakeholders’ ability to understand the details of the NECEC, 
evaluate the Project’s negative impacts on scenic and recreational values along the 
proposed new corridor, and to participate in discussions relating to the mitigation of 
those negative impacts.  
 
In addition to these findings,  as noted above, there are a  significant number of 
people in this proceeding who have questioned CMP’s trustworthiness.31  The assertion 
that CMP has not been forthright wi th respect to the NECEC is reflected in the 
arguments of several opponents to the Project, the testimony of numerous people at the 
public witness hearings, and th e majority of the more than 1,35 0 public comments the 
Commission has received in this case.    
 
e. Balancing the NECEC’s Impacts on Scenic, Historic, and 
Recreational Values with CMP’s Mitigation Efforts  
 
There are qualitative and quantitative differences between (1) the scenic, historic, 
and recreational values that a re under consideration in this  Section of the Order and (2) 
other factors listed in Section 3132(6), such as economic, reliability, state renewable 
energy generation goals, and alternatives to construction of the transmission line, that 
are discussed elsewhere in this Order.  The unqua ntifiable and subjective nature of the 
NECEC’s impact on scenic, historic, and recreational values reverberates repeatedly 
throughout the arguments of several parties and the testimony provided at each of the 
three public witness hearings held in this case .  Testimony provided at those hearings 
clearly demonstrates that the assessment of the Project’s impact on scenic, historic, 
and recreational values varies dramatically depending on , among other things, the 
identity and  experience of the commenter.  Moreo ver, the scenic, historic, and 
recreational impacts of the NECEC are relatively localized, whereas other impacts, such 
as the market pric e benefits discussed elsewhere in Section V o f this Order, are much 
broader, if not statewide.  
 
As noted above, neither  CMP , nor any other party , provided evidence that would 
allow the Commission to  quantify the NECEC’s impact on th ese values.  As a result, the 
weighing and balancing of the Project’s impact on scenic, historic, and recreatio nal 
values must necessarily be s ubjective.    
 
Based on the record in this case and the above discussion , the Commi ssion finds 
that the NECEC will  have adverse  impacts on the scenic and recreational values in  
                                                           
31 There is also some inevitable confounding of unrelated CMP billing and outage 
matters with any NECEC  concerns in some public witness testimony and some public 
comments with regard to CMP’s “trustworthiness.”

 certain communities in Somerset and Franklin counties,  as well as the  associated  
tourism  and recreation -based economy in these communities.  The Commission also 
finds that  the benefits represented by the MOU and the undergrounding of the line at 
the Kennebec Gorge are positive  and offset the adverse impacts  to some extent . 
 
E. Proximi ty to Inhabited Dwellings  
 
Section 3132(2 -C)(A) directs the applicant for approval of a CPCN to include in 
its petition, among other things, “[a]  description of the effect of the proposed 
transmission line on… the proximity of the proposed transmission line  to inhabited 
dwellings .”32  Section 3132(6) directs the Commission, in de termining public need for a 
proposed project, consider “the proximity of the proposed transmission line to inhabited 
dwellings.”   
 
The issue of the NECEC’s proximity to inhabited dwe llings received little 
discussion in this case.  Addressing this issue, CMP asserts that its  design of the 
project route also reflects its diligent efforts to avoid impacts on inhabited dwellings.  
Foremost, CMP sited approximately 73% of the NECEC within existing transm ission 
corridor owned by CMP.  Where the Company was unable to site the project within 
existing corridor, CMP conducted due diligence on necessary real estate purchases and 
sited the project within newly acquired corridor nearby few,  if any,  inhabited dwellings.  
Following this approach, the NECEC route runs almost exclusively on privately -owned, 
commercial forestland containing few, if any, nearby inhabited dwellings.  During the 
discovery phase of this proceeding, CMP provided written respo nses to data requests 
on this iss ue in at least two instances.  Other parties neither offered these data 
responses as record evidence nor presented any testimony on this subject.   CMP Initial 
Br. at 128 -129. 
 
No party in this case offered testimony on this  issue and the issue was not 
directly addressed by any of the people who testified during the three public witness 
hearings in this case.  Based on the limited record in this case on this issue, the 
Commission finds that CMP has designed the Project in a w ay that results in sufficient 
distance between the proposed transmission line and inhabited dwellings.  
 
F. State Renewable Energy Goals  
1. Incremental Hydroelectric Generation and GHG  Emissions  
 
 As discussed in S ection IV(D)  above, the Commissi on finds that incremental 
hydroelectric generation for delivery into New England promotes the State’s renewable 
energy generation goals.  At issue, then, is whether the NECEC will result in 
incremental hydroelectric generation and, thus, advance the State’ s renewable energy 
                                                           
32  As required by section 3132(2 -C)(A), CMP included a discussion of the proposed 
transmission line’s proximity to inhabited dwellings in its Septem ber 27, 2017 Petition .  
CMP Petition, Vol. 1, at 69 -70. 
ORDER   70  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 generation goals, including GHG emissions reductions .33  As discussed below, this 
issue involves consideration of: (1) whether there  would be excess water within the HQ 
system that could be used to generate energy as a result of the NECE C export path; (2) 
whether it is reasonably likely that HQ will develop additional hydroelectric capacity on 
its system, at least to some significant degree, as a result of the NECEC; and (3) if HQ 
did divert energy from another market to meet its NECEC ob ligations, as has been 
argued by some parties, what type of supply would that other market use to  replace the 
diverted HQ energy.     
a.  Positions of the Parties  
CMP and IECG argue that HQ Production currently has excess energy available 
to supply the NEC EC without diver ting energy from other markets.  CMP Initial Br. at 
98-110; IECG Initial Br. at 35 -38.  In support of this, these parties cite to publicly 
available information, as well as to a letter in which Hydro -Québec states that it spilled 
over 4.5 TWh worth of energy in 2017 and 10.4 TWh  worth of energy in 2018 due to 
lack of economic transmission, and that without additional transmission export 
capability, the quantity of spilled water in future years is expected to be comparable.  
CMP Initial Br. a t 108-109; Kelly -004-001.  CMP and IECG note, further, that that the 
PPAs between HQUS and the MA EDCs are firm contracts that impose significant 
financial consequences for failure to perform to provide incremental energy.   CMP Initial 
Br. at 138 -150.  CMP  also argues that the NECEC will contribute to HQ Production’s 
economic incentives to develop new hydroelectric facilities.   Id. 
 
Moreover, CMP states that all three analyses conducted in this case regarding 
the NECEC’s GHG reduction benefits show that the  Project’s operation would result 
substantial GHG reductions for Maine.  CMP Initial Br. at 102 -104.  Specifically, CMP 
refers to the Energyzt analysis34 that found that the NECEC would reduce Maine GHG 
emissions levels by approximately 255,000 metric tons  per year, the Daymark analysis 
that found that the NECEC would result in reductions of 264,000 metric tons  per year, 
and the LEI analysis that found that the NECEC would reduce Maine’s GHG emissions 
levels by approximately 306,000 metric tons per year.  On a regional level, these 
amounts are equivalent to GHG emissions reductions of between 3.0 and 3.6 million 
metric tons per year.  According to LEI, such reductions are equivalent to removing 
approximately 700,000 passenger vehicles from the road.  LEI Repo rt at 30.  
 
                                                           
33 Regarding the issue of potential increases in CO 2 emissions from the HQ facilities, as 
noted in the LEI Report , on a lifecycle basis, any such increases would be substantially 
lower than emissions b y natural gas generation .  LEI Report at 30.  
 
34 The Energyzt analysis also concluded that the NECEC would result in increases in 
GHG emissions in other regions (New York, PJM, Ontario) and may actually increase 
overall emissions .  Speyer Dir. Test., Exh.  JMS-4, Technical Report: New England 
Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) Regional Carbon Emissions Impacts at 3 (Apr. 2018).   
 
 
ORDER   71  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 GINT, NextEra, NRCM , and Ms. Kelly argue that the NECEC would not have any 
meaningful GHG reductions benefits, and, in fact, would increase GHG emissions 
because HQ Production would divert energy from other regions to serve its obligations 
under  the NECEC.  GINT Initial Br. at 71 -73; NextEra Initial Br. at 15 -19; NRCM Initial 
Br. at 14 -16; Kelly Initial Br. at 9 -11.  GINT and NextEra support this position by 
asserting that the PPAs with the MA EDCs do not actually require HQ Production to fulfil 
its obligations with incremental hydroelectric generation  GINT argues that HQ 
Production spilled water for reasons other than those stated by Hydro -Québec, arguing 
that Hydro -Québec has more than enough physical transmission available to export that 
energy  to market.  GINT Initial Br. at 70 -73.  GINT asserts, based on the testimony of 
Ms. Bodell and Mr. Fo wler,35 that because Hydro -Québec did not do so, that there were 
other non -transmission constraints that led to the spillage ( e.g., reservoir management, 
multi-year smoothing, opportunity cost).   Id. 
 
b.  Discussion  
 
 The Commission concludes that the NECEC will result in significant incremental 
hydroelectric generation from existing and new resources in Québec  and, therefore, will 
result in reductions in ov erall GHG emissions through corresponding reductions of fossil 
fuel generation (primarily natural gas) in the region.  In making this decision, the 
Commission recognizes the inherent uncertainty in determining how HQ Production will 
develop and operate hyd roelectric facilities over the next 20 years and beyond; thus , the  
levels of incremental hydroelectric generation and GHG reductions resulting from the 
NECEC cannot be precisely determined.36       
 
In support of this conclusion, the Commission observes th e representations 
made by Hydro -Québec in Kelly -004-001 that it was a lack of transmission  that resulted 
in the spilling of a substantial amount TWh  in 2017 and 2018 (4.5 TWh  worth of energy 
in 2017 and 10.4 TWh  worth of energy in in 2018).   Hydro -Québec  represented, further, 
that, “without additional transmission export capability,”  a comparable amount of water 
will be spilled in future yea rs.  Id.  This conclusion is supported by both the Daymark 
and LEI analyses, as well as through LEI’s testimony statin g that HQ Production has 
surplus capacity and the NECEC will provide a means to sell that surplus capacity into 
New England.  CMP Exh.  NEC EC-5 at 4; LEI Report at 12 ; Hearing Tr. at 127 -128 
(October 19, 2018).  The Daymark and LEI testimony, thus, corrobor ate the Hydro -
Québec  statements in this regard.    
 
                                                           
35 Corrected Fowler and Bodell Supp. Test. at 53 -54.  
 
36 Hydro -Québec  did not seek to intervene or participate in this proceeding .  The 
Commission notes that such participation would  have been helpful in understanding its 
prior and near -term operations.  However, the operations over 20 - to 40 -year period 
would have remained uncertain to a large degree.  
 
ORDER   72  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Furthermore, HQ Production, as a rational economic actor, will seek to maximize 
profits, and therefore will use whatever water it has available to generate energy for the 
NECEC rather than using the NECEC  to divert energy from existing markets into New 
England.  In addition, the Commission agrees with CMP that HQ Production has 
systematically increased capacity and storage capability over time in response to 
market signals for more clean energy .  Dickinson , Stinneford , and Escudero Reb. Test. 
at 30 -35 and Figures 4 and 5;  CMP  Initial Br. at 107.  Thus, the Commission finds that 
the generation imported into New England over the NECEC is likely to be incremental at 
least to a large degree, and not, in any sig nificant way, be simply diverted from other 
market s.37   
 
 With respect to Ms. Bodell’s analysis that concluded that HQ Production’s 
spillage was due to factors other than transmission availability, the Commission notes 
that it was based on one-year (2017) of data and did not account for numerous material 
factors regarding the actual available transmission capacity and mar ket conditions that 
actually determine  whether it would be economic for HQ Production to sell available 
additional energy into New England  or some other export market.  Hearing Tr. at 55 -83 
(Jan. 8, 2019) .  
 
 Further, the Commission notes that, because the PPAs between HQUS and  the 
MA EDCs are firm contracts, that, except for a force majeure  or transmission outage, 
HQUS is required to sell a nd deliver  the specified amounts of energy.  If it fails to do so, 
it will incur significant financial consequences for failure to perform.  The PPAs do not 
permit HQUS to choose non -performance for economic reasons ( i.e., to sell available 
energy into an adjoining spot market in one or more hours in which the spot price in the   
market exceeds the PPA price for the Products) and to then cure the resulting delivery 
shortfall at a later ti me.  Moreover, a willful breach of the PPAs would subject HQUS to 
subst antial termination payments being owed to both the MA EDCs and CMP, and 
would also result in substantial reputational damage to HQUS, and its parent Hydro -
Québec, that would hinder future business relationships with current and prospective 
purchasers of hy dropower generation in the region.  
 
 Therefore, because the Commission finds that the NECEC will result in 
incremental hydroelectric generation, it follows that the Project will also provide GHG 
emissions reduction benefits in the region.   As noted above,  the expert analyses 
provided in the record in this proceeding indicates that the GHG emission reductions in 
the region resulting from the NECEC would be in the range of approximately 3.0 to 3.6 
millio n metric tons per year, which as  noted above, is equiva lent to removing 
approximately 700,000 passenger vehicles from the r oad.

York, that State’s renewable energy power policies goals would likely limit to a large 
degree replacement of the power with fossil fuels.   CLF-002-003. 
ORDER   73  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 a. Positions of  the Parties  
 
NextEra,  RENEW , and NRCM argue that the NECEC will prevent the 
development of renewable energy generation  in western Maine.  NextEra Initial Br. at 
16-19; RENEW Initial Br. at 4 -6; NRCM Initial Br. at 8 -9.  Specifically, these parties 
argue that, in the event that CMP constructs the Surowiec -South interface upgrades as 
required, and the NECEC proceeds, the Pr oject will “use up” the existing “headroom” at 
that interface to the detriment of future Maine -based renewable projects.  For this 
reason, RENEW suggests that the Commission condition issuance of a CPCN for the 
NECEC on limiting the amount of import capaci ty that it can seek to qualify in the FCM 
so as not to disadvantage Maine -based renewable generation development.  RENEW 
Initial Br. at 2 -6. 
 
NextEra  argues that if the NECEC was constructed as an AC transmissi on facility 
rather than a DC facility , the NEC EC would be congruent with Maine’s renewable 
energy generation goals.  NextEra Initial Br. at 34 -38.  NextEra also argues that, if the 
NECEC were an AC facility, Maine -based solar and wind projects could use the line by 
buying transmission rights from HQUS  for the 110 MWs of unused transmission in years 
1-40 and 1 ,090 MWs of unused transmission in years 21 -40.  Id. 
 
CMP argues that that the NECEC will have no impact on renewable generation 
ahead of it in the interconnection queue and that there is no record  evidence to support 
the claims that the NECEC will impede the development of renewable generation 
projects that are behind it in the interconnection queue. CMP Initial Br. at 116 -122; CMP 
Reply Br. at 47 -54.  CMP states, that in fact, the NECEC’s transmis sion system 
upgrades will likely render it cheaper for renewable generation in western and northern 
Maine to interconnect to the regional transmission grid, which is an additional benefit to 
generation developers .  Id.  In response to NextEra’s argument th at a significant portion 
of the  NECEC should be HVAC transmission, CMP states that the use of additional 
HVAC transmission would result in: (1) the use of larger, unsightly transmission 
structures; (2) a more expensive project; and (3) higher transmission losses.  CMP 
Reply Br. at 57 -59. 
 
b. Discussion  
 
In Section V(A) above, the Commission discusses the impact of the NECEC on 
existing Maine generators, as well as  on the development of new generation facilities in 
Maine.  In that section, the Commission fin ds little merit to the concerns that the NECEC  
 would frustrate Maine -based renewable  energy development  by absorbing “headroom” 
on the transmission system.   Accordingly, the Commission concludes that NECEC will 
not hinder Maine in making progress towards  meeting its statutory renewable portfolio 
requirements and the goals under the Maine Wind Energy Act and Maine Solar Energy 
Act.  
 
The Commission agrees with CMP that the NECEC will have no impact on any 
proposed renewable generation projects in Maine wit h a better interconnection queue 
ORDER   74  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 position.  As noted above, there are currently more than 750 MW of renewable capacity 
in Maine  ahead of the NECEC in the queue.   For projects that are behind NECEC in 
the queue or are not yet in the queue, whether these pr ojects move forward depends on 
numerous factors, including the results of ISO -NE’s planning studies, the economic 
viability of each project, and the availability of PPAs that  may be necessary for the 
financing of such projects.  
 
The Commission notes that the NECEC could facilitate renewable  generation in 
Maine in that it will provide for additional transfer capacity at no cost to future generation 
developers if, as argued by several parties, the NECEC does not qualify in the FCM, or 
qualifies less than 1,2 00 MW.   
 
 In addition, as described in Section II(C) above, t he NECEC requires 
construction of several reinforcements to the transmission system south of Larrabee 
Road, including a parallel 345 kV line between the Coopers Mills Road Substation and 
the Mai ne Yankee Substation.  The ISO -NE has identified certain of these upgrades, 
including the new Coopers Mills line, as necessary to the interconnection of new 
renewable generation in western and northern Maine.38  Because  the costs of these 
reinforcements wil l be borne by the NECEC , future renewable generation  projects  may 
benefit from t he fact that they already exist at the time the ir projects seek to 
interconnect.  
 
 For these reasons, the Commission rejects RENEW’s suggestion that the 
Commission limit the am ount of NECEC -enabled capacity for participation in the 
capacity market and “reserve” that amount for certain generation types or projects.  
Such a condition would not be in the public interest and would be contrary to the first -
come, first -served design o f the ISO -NE interconnection queue and study process.39  
   
VI. REVIEW AND DISCUSSION OF STIPULATION   
 
A. Stipulation  Provisions  
 
 The major provisions of the  Stipulation  include the issuance of a CPCN for the 
NECEC and a set of “CPCN Conditions” that  contains benefit provisions in various 
categories.  Specifically, certain  CPCN Condition  provisions provide ratepayer 
protections against costs and financial risks associated with the Project or are intended 
                                                           
38 CMP -010-006, Attachment 1 (2016/2017 Maine Resource Int egration Study) at 3 
(identifying a “second 345 kV Coopers Mills – Maine Yankee 302 line” as a shared 
requirement for interconnection of both the northern and western Maine clusters).  
 
39 CMP argues that a condition that an amount of NECEC -enabled capacity  eligible for 
participation  in the capacity market be “reserved” for other generation projects is 
preempted by federal law in that the Federal Power Act vests in FERC “exclusive 
jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity in the interstate market.”  B ecause the 
Commission finds that such a condition would not be in the public interest, it need not 
address the preemption issue.  
ORDER   75  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 to reimburse ratepayers for prior costs associated w ith the Project and to compensate 
ratepayers for the benefits provided to the Project.  Additionally, certain provisions 
provide a series of public benefits through funding of various initiatives and 
commitments.  The Stipulation also includes various  additional commitments by the 
Project sponsors.  Each of the  CPCN Condition  provisions is described below .  
 
1. Ratepay er Protections and Compensation  
 
a. NECEC Project Ownership  
 
 The Stipulation includes a condition that CMP will convey the Project to NECEC 
Transmission LLC (NECEC LLC), a newly -organized subsidiary within the Avangrid 
Networks that is not a s ubsidiary of CMP.  Stip. Sec.  V.B.1.  Upon the transfer, CMP 
and NECEC LLC will enter into a Service Agreement which contains the provisions 
under which CM P will provide various services to NECEC LLC, including accounting, 
legal, information technology, other corporate support, supply chain and engineering 
services.  Stip. Sec. V.B.1.c.  In addition to the transfer of the Project, the Stipulation 
provides fo r the following:        
 
• The transfer of the Project from CMP to NECEC LLC will occur prior to the start 
of construction;  
 
• NECEC LLC will not participate in any money pooling arrangements, credit 
facilities or other financing agreements with CMP without Co mmission consent;  
 
• NECEC LLC and CMP will remove NECEC -related development expenses from 
CMP’s books;  
 
• NECEC LLC will put in place a guaranty by AVANGRID, Inc. of its payment 
obligations to CMP and with respect to the Heat Pump Fund, the Dirigo EV Fund, 
the Franklin County Host Community Benefits Fund and the Education Grant 
Funding.  In addition, NECEC LLC will grant a first priority security interest to 
CMP in NECEC LLC’s payment rights from HQUS or Hydro -Québec with respect 
to the Low -Income Customer Ben efits Fund and the Rate Relief Fund;  
 
• NECEC LLC and CMP will facilitate access to the NECEC transmission corridor 
for ATV, snowmobile , and other recreational uses;  
 
• NECEC LLC will not use CMP’s brand name, reputation or customer relations 
and will not enga ge in joint marketing or advertising with CMP;  
 
• Maine transmission and distribution customers shall not be responsible for any 
portion of the revenue requirement for the Project during at least the first 40 
years of its useful life;  
 
ORDER   76  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 • CMP and NECEC LLC will  not take or support any action to change the NECEC 
cost recovery mechanism that would result in Maine customers being responsible 
for any portion of NECEC LLC’s revenue requirement during the first 40 years of 
the Project without Commission approval;  and 
• Provided, however, that these provisions would not prohibit Maine customers 
from paying for a portion of the Project through the purchase of electricity 
provided through the 110 MW not contracted by the Massachusetts EDCs.  
 
Stip. Sec. V.B.1.d.  
 
b. Consider ation Payment  
 
 As consideration for the transfer of the Project assets and any goodwill of CMP 
related to the Project, NECEC LLC will pay CMP $60 million, payable in 40 installments 
of $1.5 million annually.  CMP will direct these payments to the NECEC Ra te Relief 
Fund described below.  Stip. Sec. V.B.1.b.  
 
c. Transmission Rates Customer Credit  
 
 Effective with the 2019 transmission rate change, CMP will provide a one -time 
credit for RNS and LNS transmission customers of $1.005 million.  This credit 
repres ents the amounts paid in rates by transmission customers for those portions of 
the transmission corridor held by CMP that have been included in FERC Account 105 
for Plant Held for Future Use.  CMP will remove all NECEC -related property from FERC 
Account 10 5 upon issuance of the CPCN.  Stip. Sec. V.B.2.  
 
d. New Corridor Removed from Transmission Rates  
 
 Upon issuance of the CPCN, CMP will remove the unused portion of the 
transmission corridor from the Canadian border to the existing Section 222 from 
Account 105 and classify it as Non -Operating Property in FERC Account 121.  CMP 
agrees that it will not reclassify this unused corridor or seek recovery in any other way 
unless the transmission project that will use this corridor is otherwise eligible for rate 
recovery from Maine retail customers pursuant to a FERC -approved transmission tariff.  
Stip. Sec. V.B.3.  
 
2. Public and Ratepayer Benefits  
a. Low-Income Customer Benefits Fund  
 Beginning with the NECEC commercial operations date (COD), NECEC LLC will 
fund a $ 40 million Low -Income Customer Benefits Fund by making 40 annual payments 
of $1.25 million.  This fund will be available to fund programs that benefit low -income 
energy customers in Maine and may be used to reduce the amounts paid by low -
income customers f or electricity or other sources of energy, for weatherization and 
household efficiency programs.  The specific use of these funds will be as designated 
by the OPA in consultation with the Efficiency Maine Trust  (EMT)  and a designee of the 
ORDER   77  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Governor.  In des ignating the use of these funds, a preference for customers located in 
the NECEC Host Communities may be applied.  Stip. Sec. V.B.4.  
 
b. Rate Relief Fund  
 Effective with the NECEC COD, a $140 million Rate Relief Fund will be 
established to provide per kilow att hour rate relief for CMP’s retail customers.  As noted, 
CMP will direct the annual $1.5 million consideration payment received from NECEC 
LLC to this fund.  NECEC LLC will provide an additional $2 million annual payment.  
The Rate Relief Fund will be f unded over 40 years and will flow to ratepayers through 
stranded costs or comparable per kilowatt hour mechanism.  In addition, to the extent 
that CMP is able to monetize the Environmental Attributes discussed in Section 
VI.A.3.d, those funds will also be contributed to the Rate Relief Fund.  Stip. Sec. V.B.5.  
 
c. Broadband Benefits  
 As part of the final design, CMP and NECEC LLC will include facilities and 
equipment necessary to provide additional fiber optic capacity on the transmission line 
with an estim ated value of $5 million.  In addition, beginning with COD, a $10 million 
Broadband Fund will be established and funded by five annual contributions of $2 
million by HQUS.  This fund may be used for grants to study and implement expanded 
availability of hi gh speed broadband in the host communities.  Stip. Sec. V.B.6.  
d. Heat Pump Benefits  
 Beginning with COD, a $15 million Heat Pump Fund will be established and 
funded by annual contributions over 8 years of $10 million by HQUS and $5 million by 
NECEC LLC.  This fund will be used for the installation of heat pumps or other efficient 
heating technologies as agreed to by the OPA, the Governor’s designee(s), CLF, 
Acadia Center, and IECG in consultation with EMT.  Stip. Sec. V.B.7.  
e. Electric Vehicle (EV) Funds  
 The Stipulation provides for two EV funds.  The $5 million Dirigo EV Fund, to be 
funded either by a lump sum contribution or over time by NECEC LLC beginning in the 
year NECEC LLC and Hydro -Québec receive all necessary permits.  This Fund will 
provide con sumer rebates for the purchase of qualifying EVs by Maine residents and 
rebates to defray the cost of workplace and other public vehicle charging installations 
and be managed pursuant to an agreement among CLF, Acadia Center , and the 
Governor’s designee.  Stip. Sec. V.B.8.a.  
 The $10 million Hydro -Québec EV Fund will be funded through five payments of 
$2 million annually from HQUS beginning on COD.  This Fund will be used to fund the 
deployment of a state -wide fast and ultra -fast public charging infrastruct ure network for 
EVs in Maine.  In addition, Hydro -Québec commits to share its expertise with respect to 
EV infrastructure in developing the programs funded by the Hydro -Québec EV Fund.  
Stip. Sec. V.B.8.b.  
f. Franklin Co unty Host Community Benefits  
ORDER   78  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  Beginn ing with COD, a $5 million fund for the benefit of communities in Franklin 
County will be established and funded by ten annual contributions of $500,000 by 
NECEC LLC.  This fund will be used to support the economic and community 
development efforts of the Greater Franklin Development Council.  Stip. Sec. V.B.9.  
g. Education Grant Funding  
 NECEC LLC will provide a total of $6 million for education -related grants and 
programs.  NECEC LLC will contribute $1 million to the University of Maine for research 
and d evelopment associated with the commercialization of marine wind generation 
technology once all State of Maine permits and approvals are received.  Stip. Sec. 
V.B.10.a.   Beginning with COD, NECEC LLC will make 10 annual contributions of 
$500,000 each to fu nd programs and scholarships for needy Maine students to attend 
the University of Maine at Farmington and vocational and training programs and 
scholarships in the math, science and technology fields in Franklin and Somerset 
Counties.  Stip. Sec. V.B.10.b.  
3. Other Commitments  
 Finally, the Stipulation contains the following additional commitments on the part 
of CMP and NECEC LLC.  
a. Mitigating  Impacts on Transmission System  
 In the Stipulation, CMP and NECEC LLC agree to a number of initiatives 
intended to mitigate the impacts of the NECEC on the transmission system and existing 
and future energy resources in Maine.  Stip. Sec. V.B.11.  These provisions are 
conditioned on the NECEC receiving a CPCN and all other necessary approvals and 
include commitments by  CMP and NECEC to:  
• Participate in all ISO -NE studies to determine the thermal, voltage and stability 
ratings for the Surowiec -South interface and advocating to maximize its stability 
rating and the total transfer capacity;  
• Engage a consultant at CMP’s expe nse, not to exceed $2 million, to evaluate 
non-wires solutions that would reduce congestion at the Maine/New Hampshire 
and Surowiec -South interfaces;  
• For any cost -effective and commercially viable non -wires solution identified, 
assess and pursue approval a nd cost allocation pursuant to the ISO -NE Tariff 
and to propose such solutions in applicable competitive solicitations; and  
• Within one year of COD, create and make available an annual electric 
transmission and distribution system report which analyzes syst em needs that 
may potentially be met by non -wires alternatives.   
Id. 
b. Regional Carbonization  
 Conditioned upon the NECEC receiving a CPCN and all other necessary 
approvals, CMP and NECEC LLC will participate in a regional decarbonization 
ORDER   79  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 collaborative c omprised of CLF, Acadia Center, utilities, the Governor’s designee, OPA, 
IECG , and other stakeholders to study ways by which the Northeast Region may 
achieve economy -wide decarbonization of zero emissions by 2050.  CMP will provide 
50% of the cost of the s tudy, not to exceed $500,000.  Stip. Sec. V.B.12.  
c. Securitization  
 Upon COD, NECEC LLC will provide $1 million to pay for any investment bank, 
investment advisor or consultant and/or legal fees incurred by OPA, the Governor’s 
designee, IECG , and CMP rela ted to the securitization of the annual payments to the 
Low-Income Customer Benefits Fund and the Rate Relief Fund.  Any funds not used for 
this purpose will be disbursed to the Rate Relief Fund.  Stip. Sec. V.B.13.  
d. HQ Support Agreement  
 Prior to the s tart of construction, CMP, NECEC LLC , and HQUS will enter into a 
support agreement reflecting HQUS’s funding commitments for the Broadband Fund, 
Heat Pump Fund, Hydro -Québec EV Fund, HQUS’s commitment to pay NECEC LLC 
$3.5 million annually and HQUS’s commi tment to provide CMP 400,000 MWh annually 
of Environmental Attributes related to deliveries of hydroelectric power to New England.  
CMP will seek to monetize the Environmental Attributes and any proceeds, net of costs 
to CMP, will be directed to the Rate R elief Fund.  
 The HQ Support Agreement will also reflect Hydro -Québec’s commitment to 
share EV infrastructure expertise and to include sufficient fiber optic capacity in the 
Québec transmission facilities to provide a fiber optic connection between Maine an d 
Montreal.  Finally, the Support Agreement will reflect the guaranty from Hydro -Québec 
of HQUS’s payment obligations.  Stip. Sec. V.B.14.  
e. Maine Worker Preferences  
 NECEC LLC, and its contractors working on the construction of the NECEC will 
give prefe rence to hiring Maine workers.  Stip. Sec. V.B.15.  
B. Stipulation Review and Approval Requirements  
Chapter 110 of the Commi ssion’s Rules specif ies that, i n deciding whether to 
approve a stipulation, the Commission will consider the following criteria:  
a. Whether the parties joining the stipulation represent a sufficiently broad 
spectrum of interests that the Commission can be sure that there is no 
appearance or reality of disenfranchisement;  
b. Whether the process that led to the stipulation was fair to all  parties;  
c. Whether the stipulated result is reasonable and is not contrary to 
legislative mandate; and  
d. Whether the overall stipulated result is in the public interest.

C. Do the Pa rties to the Stipulation Represent a  Sufficiently  Broad Spectrum 
of Interests?  
1. Background  
 
There are 30 parties in this case.  Of these 30 parties, the following 11 parties 
were signatories to the Stipulation: CMP; OPA; GEO; IECG; CLF; Acadia Center; 
WM&RC ; Lewiston;  the Chamber; IBEW; and FMM (Stipulating Parties ).  The following 
11 parties expressed opposition to the Stipulation in either written comments or oral 
comments made during the hearing on the Stipulation that was held on March 7, 2019: 
NextEra; Ms. Kelly ; GINT; NRCM ; RENEW; MREA; ReEnergy; Caratu nk; Former 
Senator Thomas Saviello; Old Canada Road ; and the Town of Wilton .  On March 28, 
2019, the Town of Farmington filed a letter stating its formal opposition to the NECEC.40  
This letter did not spe cify the Town of Farmington’s position regarding the Stipulation.  
The remaining seven parties have expressed no formal position regarding the 
Stipulation: GFDC41; Trout Unlimited; Darryl Wood; Town of Alna; Town of New Sharon; 
Town of Jackman ; and Franklin  County Commissioner Terry Brann.  
 
2. Positions of the Parties  
 
a. Signatories to the Stipulation  
 
The signatories to the Stipulation argue that they represent a sufficiently broad 
spectrum of interests to ensure that there is no appearance or reality of 
disenfr anchisement.  After identifying the “interest” represented by each of the 
signatories, CMP argues “[t] he Stipulating Parties’ varied obligations, missions, and 
constituencies all demonstrate that the Stipulation has the support of a diverse group of 
stakeh olders, and that the signin g parties do not ‘ represent only a narrow interest. ’”

41 On February 22, 2019, GFDC  filed a letter in which it “endorce[d]  the project,” 
expressed “disappointment that CMP is not doing more to benefit Franklin County from 
a broadband expansion perspective,” noted its unsuccessful efforts to get CMP to 
support the “Franklin County Broadband Initiative’s efforts,” and urged the  Commission 
to “modify the Settlement Agreement to better utilize the value of CMP’s commitment, to  
provide greater incentives for additional private investment to expand the availability of 
broadband.  Implementing our recommendation will have a much grea ter impact to the 
expansion of broadband than the current plan incorporated into the Settlement 
Agreement. ”  However, the Greater Franklin Development Council  took no formal 
position on the merits of the Stipulation.  Letter dated Feb. 19, 2019 and filed o n Feb.

 Citing Central Maine Power Company and Public Service of New Hampshire , 
Request for Certificate of Public Convenience  and Necessity for the Maine Power 
Reliability Program Consisting of the Construction of Approximately 350 Miles of 345 kV 
and 115 kV Transmission Lines (“MPRP”) , Docket No. 2008 -00255, Order Approving 
Stipulation at 20 (June 10, 2010), ( MPRP Order ) CMP st ates:  
 
[T]he Stipulation satisfies the “primary purpose” of the sufficiently broad spectrum 
of interests standard in Chapter 110, as articulated in Docket No. 2008 -00255, 
particularly:  
 
[T]o ensure that the Commission does not approve stipulations where t he 
signing parties represent only a narrow interest.  The criterion is not 
intended to require, and does not mean, that all parties participating in a 
case must sign a stipulation for the Commission to approve it.   
 
 Id. at 5.  
   
 CMP argues that in the MPRP Order,  the Commission found that “a stipulation 
entered into by 19 of more than 100 parties to a CPCN proceeding, inc luding the 
petitioning utility , ‘the OPA, representatives of the environmental community, 
representatives of the business and constructi on communities, the City of Lewiston, and 
an abutter’ satisfied the ‘ first criterion for approval of a stipulation .’”  Id. at 5, fn. 12.  
 
The IECG and OPA filed joint comments regarding the Stipulation.  Citing Public 
Utilities Commission, Investigation in to Verizon Maine’s Alternative Form of Regulation,  
Docket No. 2005 -155, Order Approving Stipulation, Docket No. 2005 -155 (Oct. 3, 2007) 
(Verizon AFOR Order ), IECG and the OPA assert that  the Commission found that the 
participation in the stipulation by th e OPA was sufficient to address the interest of all 
consumers in Maine in a manner to satisfy  this prong of the Commission’s test.  IECG 
and OPA Comments at 12 (Mar. 1, 2019).  
 
 The IECG and OPA further argue the failure of certain interests to join a 
stipu lation does not mean that the stipulating parties have failed the “broad spectrum of 
interests” requirement in Section 8(D)(7)(a).  The IECG and OPA cite the  MPRP Order  
as support for their position on this point.   Id. at 12 -13. 
 
 In its  written comments o n the Stipulation, IBEW states that it supports the 
IECG’s comments regarding the sufficiency of breadth of interests joining the 
Stipulation.  IBEW c omments at 1  (Mar. 1, 2019) .  In their comments, the Chamber , the 
City of Lewiston , CLF, Acadia Center, th e GEO, and FMM agree that the joining parties 
reflect a sufficiently broad spectrum of interests to meet  the first evaluation criterion of 
Secti on 8(D)(7).  Chamber and Lewiston Comments at 2 (Mar. 1, 2 019); CLF and 
Acadia Cent er Comments at 4 (Mar. 1, 201 9); GEO  Comments at 1 -2 (Mar. 1, 2019);

b. Parties that Did Not Sign the Stipulation  
ORDER   82  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  NRCM asserts  that the parties joining the Stipulation do not represent a 
sufficiently broad  spectrum of interests.  NRCM Comments at 1  (Mar. 1, 2019) .  NRCM 
notes that approximately two -thirds of the parties in this case did not sign the 
Stipulation.  Id. at 2.  NRCM argues  that notwithstanding  CMP ’s claim that the parties to 
the contested stipulation represent a broad spectrum of interests , the limited number of 
stipulating parties represents only a relatively narrow list of interests .  Id. at 3.  
 
NextEra argues that the Stipulation fails to represent a sufficiently broad 
spectrum of interests  and should be denied because it does not repres ent the relevant 
interests of Maine  generators.   NextEra Comments at 3  (Mar. 1, 2019) .  NextEra 
attempts to distinguish this Stipulation from the stipulation approved by the Commission 
in the MPRP Order , noting differences between the two in terms of both support for and 
participation by generators.  Id. 
 
 Noting that more parties oppose the Stipulation than support it, GINT argues that 
the signatories do not represent a sufficiently broad spectrum of interests.  GINT 
Comments at 9 (Mar. 1, 2019).  GINT ass erts that generators are not represented by 
the settling parties and that environmental groups and the affected towns are divided in 
their support of the Stipulation.  Id. 
 
Caratunk defines “public” to include the rural people located along the proposed 
corridor who will be “directly harmed by the NECEC” and asserts that this broader public 
is not represented in this Stip ulation and has been “ disenfranchised.”  Caratunk 
Comments at 2 (Mar. 1, 2019).  Caratunk argues that the affected people of Somerset 
Coun ty are not being adequately compensated for the harm that the NECEC would 
cause them.  Id. at 2.  Caratunk also argues that the Stipulation does not address the 
interests of Maine’s existing generators and would suppress the future location of 
renewable en ergy projects in Maine.  Id. at 4.  
 
 Ms. Kelly argues a different standard , i.e., that the breadth of interests in the 
joining parties to the Stipulation reflects “an appearance and reality of 
disenfranchisement.”  Kelly Comments at 4 (Mar. 1, 2019).   
 
 ReEnergy argues that a sufficiently broad spe ctrum of signatories requires a 
majority of the parties in a case to join a stipulation.  ReEnergy Comments at 2 (Mar. 1, 
2019) .  ReEnergy asserts that here, only one third of the parties are signatories to the 
Stipulation .  Id.  ReEnergy further asserts that the fact that  no independent power 
generator has joined the Stipulation  indicates a  lack of diversity in the Stipulating 
Parties.  Id.  
 
 Old Canada Road states that the stipulating parties  lack inclusion of  those who 
will be most affected by the construction and presence of the powerline.   Old Canada 
Road Comments at 1 (Mar. 1, 2019).   
 
ORDER   83  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  RENEW and MREA filed joint comments in opposition to the Stipulation.  
However, those comments did not specifically addre ss the issue of whether the 
stipulating parties represent a sufficiently broad spectrum of interests.  
 
3. Discussion  
 
The Stipulation prese nted to the Commission in this case is signed by 11 of 30 
parties and is opposed by an equal number of  active parties.  As summarized above, 
several parties argue tha t any stipulation signed by  a small er percentage of parties, and 
opposed by a larger percentage, must fail to satisfy the “sufficiently broad spectrum of 
interests” criterion of the four Section 8(D)(7) stipula tion approval criteria . 
In the  MPRP Order , the Commission stated:  
 
In the case before us, the Stipulation was entered into by 19 parties, including all 
of the utilities involved in the project, the OPA, GridSolar, the IECG, 
representatives of the environmen tal community, representatives of the business 
and construction communities, the City of Lewiston, and an abutter.  We find that 
these signatories represent a broad spectrum of interests and that there is no 
disenfranchisement or appearance of disenfranchi sement ….  We thus conclude, 
that the first criterion for approval of a stipulation has been satisfied here.  
MPRP Order  at 20.  
 
 In case before us, the Stipulation is signed by parties that represent a 
comparably diverse and broad spectrum of interests.  Her e, the signing parties include 
the utility see king the CPCN; OPA, that is charged with representing the inte rests of 
Maine’s ratepayers; IECG , that represents the interests of large industrial customers; 
CLF and Acadia Center, that are representatives of t he environm ental community; the 
Chambe r, that represents both large and small businesses; Lewiston;  and the IBEW, 
that represents the interests of electrical workers .   
 
In addition to the broad group of interests represented by the above -listed 
signatorie s, the GEO  also joined the Stipulation.  Furthermore, t he Governor’s Office 
played a significant role in the negotiation of the Stipulation.   IECG and OPA Comments 
at 12 (Mar. 31, 2019).   The Governor is the only elected state official representative of 
all Maine citizens.  The Governor’s participation in the negotiations, and her 
endorsement of the results of those negotiations through the GEO signing the 
Stipulation, enhance the breadth of the spectrum of interests joining the Stipulation.  
Verizon AFOR Order  at 7. 
 
Because of the diverse interests represented by the signatories, the Commission 
finds that the parties joining the Stipulation represent a sufficiently broad spectrum of 
interests to ensure that there was no appearance or reality of disenfranc hisement.  The 
Commission therefore concludes that the Stipulation satisfies  the first criterion for 
approval of a sti pulation .  
 
ORDER   84  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 D. Fairness of the Process to All Parties  
 
1. Positions of the Parties  
 
a. Signatories to the Stipulation  
 
In the cover letter to th e Stipulation, CMP asserts that the process that gave rise 
to the Stipulation was “fair, open and transparent” and that the provisions of the 
Stipulation are “ based on extensive information presented in this proceeding and 
gathered through exhaustive disco very and discussions among CMP and the 
intervening parties, including the Stipulating Parties and Staff. ”  Stip. Cover Letter at 5.  
CMP further states:  
 
During the cas e, CMP and interested intervenors  participated in bilateral 
settlement discussions from time to time.  In addition, Staff, CMP, and many of 
the intervenors participated in formal settlement conferences on September 7 
and 14, 2018, and February 5 and 12, 2019.  Staff provided advance notice of all 
such settlement conferences by procedural orde r or email notifications sent to all 
parties on the service list.  None of the participating parties objected to Staff’s 
participation in such settlement conferences.  
 
All Intervenors had the opportunity to participate in the settlement conferences 
and the re is no appearance or reality of disenfranchisement.  All of the settlement 
conferences were publicly noticed in advance and the parties were given a 
reasonable opportunity to participate.  Additionally, those intervenors who were 
active in the proceeding  and who now oppose the Stipulation attended and 
participated in the settlement conferences (e.g., Ms. Kelly, NRCM, the Generator 
Intervenors, and NextEra).  
 
Id. at 6.  
 Citing the Verizon AFOR Order , IECG and OPA assert that Chapter 110 does not 
require th at every party participate in every settlement discussion and that it is 
“reasonable not to include all individual parties i n certain settlement discussions, for 
instance parties whose views are clea r and the other parties did not plan to incorporat e 
such views in their agreement.”  IECG and OPA Comments at 10 (Mar. 1. 2019).  The 
IECG and OPA further argue that the Commission affirmed these findings in the MPRP 
Order .  Id. at 10 -11. 
 
The IECG and OPA argue that, in evaluating the fairness of the process, t he 
Commission must look at the entire process as a whole.  The IECG and OPA note that , 
in this case , the Stipulation was filed after the briefing and hearing stages of the 
proceeding and after the case had been fully developed.  Id. at 11.  The IECG and OP A 
further note that in this case, all parties were given an opportunity to (1) participate in 
settlement conferences prior to the filing of the Stipulation, (2) file written comments on 
ORDER   85  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 the Stipulation, and (3) make oral argument during a hearing that was held on the 
Stipulation.  Id.   
 
 Finally, the IECG and OPA note the similarity  between  the process  that produced 
this stipulation and the processes in the Verizon AFOR  and MPRP  cases, concluding 
that under Commission precedent the process leading to this Stipulation was fair.   Id. at 
18.   
 
In its written comments on the Stipulation, IBEW states that it supports the 
IECG’s comments regarding the fairness of the process that led to the Stipulation.  
IBEW Comments at 1 (Mar. 1, 2019).  In their jointly -filed comme nts, the Chamber and  
Lewiston also state their support for the IEC G’s comments regarding the second  
evaluation criterion of Section 8(D)(7).  Chamber and Lewiston Comments at 2  (Mar. 1, 
2019) . 
 
In their joint comments, CLF and Acadia Center describe the Stipulation process 
as fair, open , and transparent.  CLF and Acadia Center Comments at 4  (Mar. 1, 2019) .   
 
To support its position that  the process that produced the Stipulation was fair, the 
GEO notes the fact that there  were four formal settlement c onferences that were  
noticed in advance by the Hearing Examiner in the proceeding.   GEO Comments at 2 
(Mar. 1, 2019).    
 
 FMM asserts that when considering the fairness of the stipulation process, the 
Commission should look at the process for the entire ca se and notes that that process 
has been “exhaustive.”  FMM co mments at 1 (Mar. 1, 2019).  Furthermore, FMM  notes 
that any  party could have participate d in the stipulation discussions , and that many did. 
Id.  
 
b. Parties that Did Not Sign the Stipulation  
 
NRCM  argues that the process that produced the Stipulation was not fair to all 
parties in this case.   NRCM Comments at 3 (Mar. 1, 2019).   NRCM argues  that, 
notwithstanding the formal settlement conferen ces convened by the Commission S taff, 
the Stipulation was  largely “fixed” when NRCM and other parties were first provided the 
settlement terms in February.  NRCM supports that provision by noting that the  
stipulation changed very little after that point.   Id. 
 
 GINT argues that the process that produced the Stip ulation was not fair to all 
parties .  GINT Comments at 9 (Mar. 1, 2019).  GINT notes that  it would not be fair to 
them nor to  other intervenors, who invested substantial fund s and effort in the 
proceeding  to have their factual issues resolved by a stipulat ion to which they did not  
agree.  Id. 
 
Caratunk asserts that the process that produced the Stipulation was not fair.  
Caratunk argues that  the process should have incorporated some of the valid concerns 
ORDER   86  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 of the parties and addressed some of the issues brough t up in the hearings and briefs.   
Caratunk Comments at 4 (Mar. 1, 2019).  In support of its assertion that the Stipulation 
process was not fair, Caratunk notes that CMP failed to sufficiently analyze critical 
issues and failed to explore reasonable amendme nts to its proposed Project.  Id. at 4 -5.  
Caratunk also asserts that CMP’s failure to include Caratunk in the Stipulation 
negotiations is similar to CMP’s failure to include Caratunk and other key stakeholders 
in CMP’s outreach efforts regarding the Proje ct and its discussion with WM&RC about 
the MOU.  Id. at 3.   
 
Ms. Kelly and Old Canada Road agree with these parties that  the process that 
led to the Stipulation was not fair.  Kelly  Comments at 5 -4 (Mar. 1, 2019); Old Canada 
Road Comments at 1 (Mar. 1, 20 19).   
 
 Finally, ReEnergy and NextEra noted that they took no position on the fairness of 
the process, and RENEW and MREA did not address the issue.   ReEner gy Comments 
at 2 (Mar. 1, 2019); NextEra Comments at 2, fn. 7  (Mar. 1, 2019) .  
   
2. Discussion  
 
a. Summa ry of Settlement Process  
 
The Commission held settlement conferences in the Commission’s hearing room 
on September 7 and 14, 2018.  Through separate procedural orders, all parties were 
given notice of the settlement conferences and an opportunity to attend  the 
conferences.  After the September 14th conference, CMP pursued bilateral discussions 
with several parties including the IECG, OPA, CLF, Ms. Kelly, and “representatives from 
Franklin County.”  Hearing Tr. at 153, 179 (Mar. 7, 2019).  On November 8, 201 8, CMP, 
Avangrid, the IECG and OPA met to discuss settlement issues.  Id. at 155.  Following 
that meeting, CMP had bilateral discussions with the GEO, CLF, Acadia Center, and 
“other interested stakeholders.”  Id. at 157.   
 
On or about December 30, 2018, IECG and OPA met with representatives of 
HQUS.  Id. at 158.  During the month of January, there were several meetings involving 
HQ, HQUS , CMP, GEO,  IECG, and OPA.  Id. at 158.  Also during the month of January, 
CMP had bilateral discussions with several par ties and stakeholders including CLF, 
Acadia Center,  IBEW, the Chamber, Lewiston, WM&RC, Former State Senator Saviello, 
GFDC, Representative Landry, Ms. Kelly, and FMM about issues relating to settlement.   
Id. at 160 -162, 179.  During this time, OPA also h ad bilateral discussions with Former 
State Senator Saviello, GFDC, Represe ntative Landry, and CLF, and  IECG had 
discussions with NRCM.  Id. at 163 -165.     
 
As a result of their bilateral and multilateral settlement discussions, HQ, HQUS, 
CMP, IECG, OPA, G EO, CLF, and Acadia Center entered int o a term sheet in late 
January  2019.  Id. at 160.   
 
ORDER   87  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 The Commission held settlement conferences in the Commission’s hearing room 
on February 5 and 12, 2019 .  Through separate procedural orders, all parties were 
given n otice of the settlement conferences and an opportunity to attend the 
conferences.  During the February 5th settlement conference, CMP presented the term 
sheet that had been agreed to in late January.  Id. at 169.  After the February 5th 
settlement conferen ce, CMP had bilateral discussions about the term sheet with Former 
State Senator Saviello, GFDC, Representative Landry, NextEra, and the Towns of Alna 
and Jackman.  Id. at 169, 171.  The evolving Stipulation was modified based on these 
conversations.  Id.  
 
CMP presented the Stipulation to those present during the settlement conference 
held at the Commission on February 12th.  Id. at 170.  Additional changes were made to 
the Stipulation following the February 12th settlement conference.  Id.   Between 
Febru ary 12th and February 20th, CMP had bilateral discussions with MREA and 
RENEW.  Id. at 171. CMP sent the final Stipulation to all parties via e -mail on February 
20, 2019.  Id. at 170.  CMP received feedback on the Stipulation from FMM and the 
Towns of Alna  and Jackman.  Id. at 171.  CMP filed the Stipulation on February 21, 
2019.   
 
While GINT participated in all four settlement conferences held in the 
Commission’s hearing room, GINT does not recall ever receiving notice of, or invitation 
to, any bilateral or multilateral settlement discussions that took place between 
September 14, 2018 and February 20, 2019.  Id. at 176.  Neither the Town of Caratunk 
nor Old Canada Road received notice of, or invitation to, any bilateral or multilateral 
settlement discussio ns that took place between September 14, 2018 and February 20, 
2019.  Id. at 180.  The IECG states that, during the  September 14, 2018 to February 20, 
2019 timeframe, it had two conversations with an NRCM representative about 
settlement issues and, from th ose conversations, “it was clear…that there was no 
interest in settling.”  Id. at 178.  
     
b. Decision  
 
Section 8(D)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure provides:  
All parties shall be given an opportunity to participate in stipulation 
discussions.  Accordingly, persons initiating such discussions 
should provide reasonable notice of discussions to all other parties 
where feasible, hold discussions at the office of the Public Utilities 
Commission where practicable and defer execution of 
comp rehensive stipulations until the deadline for petitions to 
intervene, if any, has passed.  In addition, all parties and proposed 
intervenors must be provided sufficient opportunity to review any 
executed stipulation in order to allow reasonable opportunity  to 
object to the stipulation.  
 As noted above, Section 8(D)(7) provides that, when deciding whether to 
approve a stipulation, the Commission must consider four criteria.  The second of 
ORDER   88  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 the four criteria is “[w]hether the process that led to the stipulatio n was fair to all 
parties.”  
 
 In this case, parties opposed to the Stipulation argue that the process that 
led to the Stipulation was not fair for several reasons including (1) the Stipulation 
was negotiated between and among a small number of parties; (2)  there were 
few changes made to the agreement after it was presented to the parties during 
the February 5th and February 12th settlement conferences; (3) the settling 
parties excluded some parties in the settlement discussions; (4) the public was 
not adequ ately represented in settlement discussions; (5) the settling parties 
were not required to provide evidence, analysis, or explanation about the specific 
Stipulation terms; (6) the Stipulation does not address many of the key issues 
raised in the case; (7) CMP failed to do the analysis necessary to evaluate the 
provisions of the Stipulation; and (8) the stipulating parties failed to adequately 
consider possible amendments to the Stipulation.  
 
In the Verizon AFOR  Case, the Commission held that neither Section  
8(D)(1)  nor the Commission’s second stipulation review criterion requires that 
every party be included in every settlement meeting.  In the Verizon AFOR Case, 
the Commission also found that  failure to  include a party in certain settlement 
discussions  was not unreasonable, because  the views of the party were clear 
and the other parties did not plan to incorporate such views in their agreement.  
As the above summary of the Stipulatio n settlement indicates, CMP, IECG, and 
OPA  had numerous bilateral and multil ateral discussions  with several parties in 
this case and during the course of such discussions , and the four settlement 
conferences held in the Commission’s hearing room, it became clear  that the 
positions of parties  such as NRCM, GINT , Caratunk, and Old C anada Road,  
were not reconcilable  with the positions of the settling parties . 
 
In deciding whether the process that lead to the Stipulation was fair, the entire 
process must be looked at as a whole.  See, Verizon AFOR  Case , Order Approving 
Stip. at 9.  In this case,  the Stipulation was filed with the Commission after the hearing 
and briefing stages  and the parties have had a full opportunity to present their positions 
to the Commission.  In addition, the Examiners scheduled four noticed settlement 
conferenc es, which were open to all parties in the case.  Furthermore, the process  
allowed those parties who were not signatories to the Stipulation, to file written 
objections and also provided such parties  with an opportunity to present oral argument 
on the Stipu lation .  Under comparable circumstances in the MPRP C ase, the 
Commission found that the stipulation process in that that case was fair to all parties.  
MPRP Case , Order Approving Stipulation  at 21 -22.  In this case, the Commission finds 
that the overall pr ocess, including the process provided by the full litigation schedule, 
noticed settlement conferences, and process subsequent to the presentation of the 
Stipulation, was fair and that the Commission’s second stipulation review criterion has 
been satisfied here.

 E. Stipulated Result is Reasonable, is Not Contrary to Legislative Mandate, 
and is in the Public Interest  
 
 The third  and fourth stipulation review  criteria are whether the stipulated result is 
reasonable and not contrary to Legislative mandate, and  in the public interest.  In the 
context of this proceeding, the Commission concludes that these stipulation approval 
criteria are essentially the same as the requirement in statute that the Commission find 
a public need to approve a transmission line proj ect.  The issue of public need is 
discussed in S ections IV(A) , above.    
 
As discussed above, the Commission finds that , even without the additional 
benefits provided by the CPCN Conditions set forth in Stipulation Section V.B 
(Stipulation Benefits), the N ECEC would meet the statutory public need and public 
interest standards of Title 35 -A, Section 3132 and, thus, would be granted a CPCN.  
The Commi ssion finds, further, that these provisions of the NECEC Stipulation , and the 
benefits they provide , augment t he market benefits and the direct, indirect, and induced 
macroeconomic benefits which will accrue to Maine from the development, construction, 
and operation of the NECEC.  The Stipulation Benefits are described in Section VI(A)  
and discussed and evaluated below.  
 
1. Positions of the Parties on the Stipulation Benefits  
 
CMP , OPA , and IECG argue that the Stipulation will provide additional, 
substantial benefits that supplement the benefits provided by the Project and further 
support the conclusion that the Stip ulation  is in the public interest .  Specifically, the 
transfer of the Project into a separate entity  and other ring -fencing provisions ensure 
that Maine ratepayers will not bear the cost of the NECEC.  Additionally, they cite the 
creation of a $50 million Low-Income Customer Fund and $140 million Rate Relief 
Fund; the construction of broadband infrastructure in the NECEC corridor; the creation 
of additional funds, including, $15 million for heat pumps, the $15 million EV fund,  the 
$5 million Franklin County  fund, and the $6 million education fund  as providing  an 
additional $250 million in benefits to Maine Citizens and energy consumers .  OPA  and 
IECG also argue that these benefits are tangible and enforceable, are incremental to 
the $1 billion in benefits al ready provided by the NECEC and incorporate the customer 
protections previously agreed to by CMP as part of this proceeding.  Finally, OPA  and 
IECG state that, collectively, the benefits and protections substantially exceed any costs 
or risks related to th e Project.  
 
 GINT  argue s that most of the benefits are illusory or unproven and that CMP 
overstates the value of the benefits , for example,  payments to the rate relief fund are 
“paltry”  and represent  only about 9 cents per month for the average CMP reside ntial 
customer.42  GINT states that the negative effects of the Project include: decrease in 
                                                           
42 Exhibi t A to GINT’s  March 1, 2019 Comments on the Stipulation contains GINT’s 
calculation of the Rate Relief Fund benefits.  GINT’s Total Rate Relief shown includes 
the annual $1.5 million consideration payment from NECEC LLC to C MP and the 
ORDER   90  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 efficiency in the regional electric grid resulting from increased system congestion and 
line losses ; distortion of the wholesale energy markets ; premature retiremen t of electric 
generating plants in Maine ; elimination of new renewable plants in Maine due to 
increased interconnection costs and system inefficiencies ; consequent loss of Maine 
jobs and taxes ; increased carbon dioxide emissions in the region ; and adverse effects 
on tourism in Western Maine.   Finally, GINT states that the Stipulation does not 
adequately reimburse ratepayers for the purchase of the NECEC corridor or for the 
value of having CMP employees available for operations and repair of the line.   
 
 Citing a statement made at the March 7th Hearing in which CMP expressed 
concerns about the effect that including community benefits packages in the proposed 
transmission projects would have on transmission rates , NextEra states that, by CMP’s 
own admission,  the benefits contained in the Stipulation are not in the public interest.  
NextEra also questions the Commission’s authority to enforce a number of the 
Stipulation benefits against Hydro -Québec and HQUS because the Commission lacks 
jurisdiction over third -party, foreign entities.   
 
 Other supporters of the  Stipulation, including CLF, Acadia Center, GEO, FMM, 
IBEW, the Chamber, and Lewiston  state that the Stipulation includes many benefits for 
Maine and the Project is poised to create additional jobs, fund  electric vehicles, reduce 
electricity prices expand broadband access , and substantially reduce the State’s carbon 
footprint.  The Chamber and Lewiston argue that certain benefits are of particular 
significance, most notab ly the Low -Income and Rate Relief Funds which will particularly 
benefit the City because of its relatively high poverty rate and old housing stock and the 
likelihood of new local jobs because Lewiston will be the site of the NECEC converter 
station.  
 
 Other opponents of the Stipulation, in cluding Caratunk , NRCM, RENEW, MREA, 
ReEnergy , and Old Canada Road  cite a number of concerns with the settlement 
package, including that it does little to address the fundamental flaws in the Project or 
address the  likely impacts of the Project on  the land , brand, citizens , or ratepayers of 
Maine .  Additionally, they argue that some of the benefits are spread over such a long 
period of time that the results will be imperceptible to Maine ratepayers, specifically the 
Rate Relief Fund payable over 40 years an d the Low -Income Customer Benefits Fund, 
also payable over 40 years.  Opponents with an interest in renewable generation argue 
that the NECEC will harm renewable energy development in Maine and the associated 
benefits to Maine ratepayers and will harm the attainment of Maine’s economic 
development, renewable energy , and GHG  reduction goals.  Additionally, ReEnergy 
argues that the Stipulation does nothing to mitigate the substantial and irrevocable 
damage that will be done to in -state generators due to conge stion on the Maine -New 
                                                           
annual $3.5 million CMP Rate Relief Fund as separate and additive items.  The 
Commission understands that the Stipulation provides that CMP will direct the annual 
consideration payment from NECEC LLC to the Rate Relief Fund and it is not, 
theref ore, a separate, additive benefit.

 Hampshire interface.  Finally, Ms. Kelly urges the Commission to delay any action on 
the Stipulation or the proceeding until the DEP and LUPC proceedings are complete.   
 
2. Discussion and Evaluation of Stipulation Benefits  
 
As noted ab ove, the Commission finds that the benefits provided by the 
Stipulation augment the market benefits and the direct, indirect, and induced 
macroeconomic benefits which will accrue to Maine from the development, construction, 
and operation of the NECEC.  In addition, the Stipulation  Benefits  contain  a number of 
provisions intended to protect CMP ratepayers from the risks and costs associated with 
the NECEC development, construction , and operation.  As noted above, t he Stipulation 
characterizes these benefits and protections as “CPCN Conditions” and the Stipulating 
Parties recommend that the issuance of a CPCN be conditioned on these terms 
contained in Section V.B. of the Stipulation.  The Commission’s assessment and 
valuation of these benefits and ratepayer pr otections is discussed below and 
summarized in Figure VI.2.  Because many of the benefit funds are established and/or 
disbursed over time, the valuation is provided on both a nominal and present value 
basis.43    
 
a. Ratepayer Protections and Compensation  
 
i. NECEC Project Ownership  and Affiliate Transactions      
          
Stipulation Sections V.B.1. a, c, d, f , and g contain a number of provisions 
intended to insulate CMP fro m the risks of the NECEC.  Specifically, the Project  and 
any associated development cos ts will be transferred from CMP to the special purpose 
entity, NECEC LLC, prior to the start of construction.  NECEC LLC will be within the 
Avangrid Networks family of companies but will not be a direct subsidiary of CMP.  
Additionally, NECEC LLC will not participate in money -pooling arrangements or credit 
facilities with CMP and CMP will have no responsibility for any on -going costs of the 
Project.  Any transactions between CMP and NECEC LLC will be governed by a 
Service Agreement or other affiliate agreem ents to be approved by the Commission.  
NECEC LLC will put into place an AVANGRID, Inc. guaranty with respect to its payment 
obligations for the EV, heat pump, host community and education funds and grant CMP 
a security interest in its payment rights from HQ and H QUS for the rate relief and low -
income funds.  Finally, NECEC LLC will not use CMP’s brand name, reputation or 
customer relations to its benefit.  
 
These ring fencing arrangements provide effective separation of CMP from the 
risks associated with th e remaining development efforts and, most particularly, the 
construction of the Project.  These protections provide a clear benefit to CMP 
ratepayers.  The transactions and on -going interactions between CMP and NECEC 
                                                           
43 The present values shown in Figure VI.2 were calculated using an 8.5% discount 
rate.  The ranges shown in Figure I.1 are based on present value calculations using 
discount rates of 7% and 8.5%.  
ORDER   92  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 LLC, and among CMP, NECEC LLC , and othe r entities involved in the NECEC Project, 
including HQ, HQUS and AVANGRID, Inc., will be governed by various agreements, 
including the proposed NECEC Transfer Agreement (Attachment B to the Stipulation), 
the Service Agreement (Exhibit H to the NECEC Transf er Agreement), the guaranty 
provided by AVANGRID, Inc., and the HQUS Support Agreement.  The Commission 
does not approve the form of any agreements provided in connection with the 
Stipulation but will conduct proceedings pursuant to Title 35 -A, Sections 70 7 and 708 to 
approve the creation of NECEC, LLC and all associated affiliated transactions.  The 
Commission emphasizes that, in these proceedings, the issues determined in this 
proceeding wi ll not be relitigated.    
 
ii. Consideration Payment  
 
 Section V.B.1.b provides that, as “consideration for the conveyance of the 
NECEC, including without limitation, the Real Estate Interests, the Permits, the TSAs, 
the Third -Party Vendor Agreements, the Related Assets, and any goodwill of CMP 
related to the NECEC,” NECEC LL C will pay to CMP the sum total of $60 million, 
payable in 40 annual installments of $1.5 million beginning when the NECEC reaches 
commercial operations.  The present value of this flow of payments is approximately 
$12 million.  CMP will direct these payme nts to the Rate Relief Fund and the benefit the 
Rate Relief Fund provides to ratepayers is discussed below.  Pursuant to statute and 
rule, however, the Commission must determine the appropriate value to assign to the 
consideration payment for the transfer of the NECEC irrespective of how CMP is 
directing the funds it receives.  Title 35-A, Section 707(3)(G), requires that “for any 
contract of arrangement expected to involve the use by an affiliated interest of utility 
facilities, services or intangibles, in cluding good will or use of a brand name, the 
Commission shall determine the value of those facilities, services or intangibles.”  In 
addition, although the Commission is making no determination here as to whether the 
NECEC is a non -core utility service, S ection 4.C.3 of Chapter 820 of the Commission’s 
Rules provides useful guidance as to the valuation of any goodwill associated with the 
NECEC that CMP is transferring.  Section 4.C.3 provides:  
 
The value of good will shall be presumed to be, and calculated  as, 1% of the total 
capitalization of the affiliate, or 2% of the gross revenues of the affiliate, 
whichever is less, and shall be paid annually by the affiliate.  Where the name of 
the utility has been used in Maine by the utility for less than 3 years, the value of 
good will shall be presumed to be zero.  At the end of six years from the date the 
affiliated transaction is approved or upon the date that the affiliate commences 
use of the good will, whichever is later, the value of good will is zero.  
GINT argues that the Commission should value the right-of-way by reference to a 
2012 study for the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and estimates made by 
American Electric Power, both of which suggest that the value of the corridor should be 
10% of tota l project costs, or $100 million.   GINT Comments at 4  (Mar.  1, 2019 ).   The 
Commission decline s to follow that estimating methodology.   In this case, NECEC LLC 
can be viewed as any other interconnecting generator which is required to pay for 
incremental up grades but not for facilities and land that already exist.  The property cost 
ORDER   93  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 of the new corridor from the Canadian border to the Kennebec Gorge was 
approximately $12.5 million.  EXM -001-017, Attachment 1.  These parcels were 
acquired largely between 2016 and 2017 in what appear to be arms -length transactions.  
There is no evidence that the cost of real property in Western Maine has changed 
substantially in the last several years.  The Transfer Agreement contemplates the 
transfer of only half of this part o f the corridor with a value of approximately $6 million.    
 
With respect to goodwill, in the context of the Massachusetts 83D solicitation , 
CMP emphasized the value of its experience, proven track record in developing large 
transmission projects and finan cial strength as competitive advantages it offered.  In this 
situation, where establishing a precise value for goodwill would be exceptionally difficult, 
the Commission can follow the guidance contained in Chapter 820.  Using this 
methodology  does not cons titute a Commission finding that the NECEC is a Non -Core 
Service.  As shown in Figure VI.1, assuming the total capitalization of NECEC LLC is 
approximately equal to the project cost and using the payment stream provided for in 
the TSAs, the value of goodwi ll would total approximately $15 million over the first 6 
years of the TSA terms or approximately $9 million on a present value basis.   
 
Figure VI.1 
 
 The proposed transfer includes the assumption by NECEC LLC of the obligations 
of CMP pursuant to the 83 D bid and the TSAs.  Specifically, NECEC LLC will assume 
the costs and risks associated with the construction of the Project.  These risk of cost 
overruns may be substantial, especially with respect to any environmental mitigation 
that may be ordered by the DEP and the LUPC  and the costs of the underground 
crossing of the Kennebec Gorge.  On balance, the Commission determines that the 
proposed Transfer Consideration is reasonable.

 iii. Transmission Rates Customer Credit  
 
Since CMP acquired the property in t he 2016 -2017 time -period for the 
approximately 53 -mile long corridor from the Québec border to the Kennebec Gorge, 
CMP has recorded the property as a rate base item in FERC Account 105, Plant Held 
for Future Use.  Pursuant to FERC regulations, property may  be recorded in Account 
105 if and when a transmission project for development on the property is sufficiently 
definite.  Once recorded in this account, the revenue requirements, which are 
comprised of a return on the property rate base (investment amount) , are recovered 
from ratepayers through operation of the FERC formula rate.  Since 2016, CMP has 
recovered from ratepayers in Maine and the region approximately $1 million associated 
with the NECEC corridor.   
 
Section V.B.2 of the Stipulation provides tha t, effective with the 2019 
transmission rate change, CMP will provide a $1.005 million rate credit to regional and 
local network service customers.  This credit reflects the amounts that have been paid 
by these customers for the NECEC corridor, plus carryi ng costs using the FERC refund 
formula.  Finally, Section V.B.2 provides that, upon issuance of a CPCN, CMP will 
remove from FERC Account 105 all NECEC -related property.  
 
This provision provides equity for ratepayers by crediting back to them all 
amounts t hat they have paid in rates since 2016 for the NECEC property and requiring 
the property to be accounted for in a manner such that, on a going forward basis, no 
amounts will be included in rates.  Because transmission rates and accounting rules are 
FERC -jurisdictional, including this provision in the Stipulation produces a resul t that 
avoids any potential pre emption challenge that might ensue if the Commission sought to 
impose a condition that would produce the same result.  This is a clear benefit provided  
by the Stipulation.   
 
iv. New Corridor Removed from Transmission Rates   
 
Paragraph V.B.3 of the Stipulation requires CMP to classify the portion of the 
corridor that will not be used by the NECEC, which will remain CMP property, as Non -
Operating Property.  Pursuant to FERC requirements, Non -Operating Property is 
recorded in FERC Account 121 and may not be included in transmission rates until such 
time CMP identifies a sufficiently definite transmission project for development in the 
corridor.  Pursuant to th is Stipulation provision, CMP agrees that it will not seek to 
recover any amounts associated with this property unless the identified transmission 
project that would use the corridor is otherwise eligible for rate recovery in whole or in 
part from Maine  customers pursuant to the then -applicable FERC transmission tariff. 
Thus, this provision eliminates the risk that ratepayers would again be charged amounts 
for property associated with an NECEC -like project, or a generator lead, as they have 
been since 2016 for the NECEC corridor.  
 
 As with the transmission rate credit provision discussed above, because the 
accounting and ratemaking treatment of transmission property are FERC -jurisdictional, 
ORDER   95  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 including this provision in the Stipulation produces a resul t that a voids any potential 
preemption challenge that might ensue if the Commission sought to impose a condition 
that would produce the same result and, as such, is a clear benefit of the Stipulation.  
 
b. Public and Ratepayer Benefits  
 
i. Low-Income Customer Benefits  Fund  
 
 Section V.B.4 of the Stipulation provides for annual payments of $1.25 million 
over the 40 years following COD that will be directed to a fund to be used for the benefit 
of low -income electric customers throughout the State.  The funds may be used to 
reduce the amounts that low -income customers spend for energy and may include 
weatherization and household energy efficiency programs.  In designating uses for 
these funds, the OPA, in consultation with the Efficiency Maine Trust  and the 
Governor’s desi gnee, may apply a preference for low -income energy customers in the 
NECEC Host Communities.  This direct benefit will total $50 million over 40 years.  On a 
present value basis, the Low -Income Customer Fund provides approximately $10 
Million  of direct bene fit to the citizens of Maine.  
 
ii. Rate Relief Fund  
 
 Section V.B.5 of the Stipulation provides for two payment streams totaling $3.5 
million annually over the 40 years following COD that will be directed to the Rate Relief 
Fund.  First, the annual $1.5 mi llion consideration payment from NECEC LLC to CMP 
will be directed by CMP to the Rate Relief Fund.  Second, NECEC LLC commits to 
provide an annual payment of $2 million to CMP for the Rate Relief Fund.  The 
Stipulation provides that the Rate Relief Fund wi ll be paid to ratepayers on a per 
kilowatt hour basis through stranded costs or a similar per kilowatt hour mechanism.  
This direct ratepayer benefit will total $140 million over 40 years.  On a present value 
basis, the Rate Relief Fund provides approximat ely $28 Million  of direct ratepayer  
benefit.  
 
iii. Broadband Benefits  
 
 The broadband benefits in Section V.B.6  of the Stipulation  include provisions for 
including fiber optic facilities and equipment on the transmission line, with an estimated 
value of $5 million, and the creation of a $10 million broadband fund to be used to 
support high speed broadband infrastructure in the host communities.  This direct 
benefit will total $15 million.  On a present value basis, the broadband benefits provide 
approxima tely $9 million  of direct benefit to the host communities.  
 
iv. Heat Pump Benefits  
 
 Section V.B.7 establishes the Heat Pump Benefits F und which includes the 
creation of a $15 million fund to support the installation of heat pumps or other future 
efficient  heating technologies.  The disbursement of these funds may include a 
ORDER   96  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 preference for targeted initiatives to reach low - and moderate -income individuals and 
communities.  This direct benefit will total $15 million.  On a pr esent value basis, the  
heat pump benefits provide approximately $7.5 million  of direct benefit to the State.  
 
v. Electric Vehicle (EV) Funds  
 
 The EV benefits contained in Section V.B.8 include two funds, a $5 million fund 
to provide rebates to defray the cost of charging installations an d consumer rebates on 
the purchase of an EV, and a $10 million fund to support the deployment of a statewide 
fast and ultra -fast public charging station infrastructure throughout the State.  This direct 
benefit will total $15 million.  On a present value b asis, the EV benefits provide 
approximately $9 million  of direct benefit to the State.  
 
vi. Franklin  County Host Community Benefits  
 
 The Franklin County community benefits in Section V.B.9 include the 
establishment of a $5 million fund for the benefit of communities in Franklin County.  
This fund will support economic and community development activities for the benefit of 
Franklin County residents.  This direct benefit will total $5 million.  On a present value 
basis, this fund provides approximately $2.4  million  of direct benefit to Franklin County.  
 
  vii. Education Grant Funding  
 
 Section V.B.10 contains the education benefits which provide for a $1 million 
grant to the University of Maine for research and development associated with the 
commercializati on of marine wind generation technology and for the creation of a $5 
million fund to provide programs and scholarships for needy Maine students to attend 
the University of Maine at Farmington and vocational and training programs and 
scholarships in the mat h, science , and technology fields in Franklin and Somerset 
Counties.  This direct benefit will total $6 million.  On a present value basis, this fund 
provides approximately $3.3 million of direct benefit to the University of Maine and the 
residents of Fran klin and Somerset Counties.  
 
c. Other Commitments  
 
i. Mitigating Impacts on Transmission System  
 
 Section V.B.11 of the Stipulation contains several commitments by CMP and 
NECEC LLC to initiatives intended to mitigate the impacts of the NECEC on the 
transmissi on system and existing and future energy resources in Maine.  Although 
these initiatives may be valuable undertakings, the Commission does not assign a direct 
monetary benefit to these commitments.   
  
ii. Regional Carbonization  
 
ORDER   97  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
  Section V.B.12 contains t he commitment by CMP and NECEC LLC to participate 
in and provide funding for regional decarbonization studies.   Although this initiative may 
be a valuable undertaking, the Commission does not assign a direct monetary benefit to 
this commitment.  
 
iii. Secu ritization  
 
 The provisions of Section V.B.13 address ways to accelerate the receipt o f 
benefits associated with the Low -Income  Fund  and the Rate Relief F und by providing 
$1 million in underwriting fees and other costs.  Any funds not used for this purpose  will 
be disbursed to the Rate Relief Fund.  The Commission values this commitment at $1 
million on a nominal basis.  Because no time frame is associated with the use of these 
funds for their intended purpose, the Commission cannot determine a present valu e.  
 
iv. HQ Support Agreement  
 
 The HQ Support Agreement contained in Section V.B.14 is intended to provide 
support to the commitments made by HQUS as part of the Stipulation.  The 
Commission does not assign any value to this support other than the values already 
established as part of other Stipulation sections.  
 
 In addition, the HQ Support Agreement will contain HQUS’s commitment to 
provide CMP 400,000 MWh annually of Environmental Attributes related to deliveries of 
hydroelectric power to New England.   There is no active market for these 
Environmental Attributes, which are a creation of the Massachusetts statute which led to 
the 83D solicitation.  The Commission does not assign any value to this commitment.   
 
v. Maine Worker Preferences  
 
 Section V.B.1 5 contains the commitment of NECEC LLC, and its contractors 
working on the construction of the NECEC , to give preference to hiring Maine workers, 
all other factors being equal and consistent with applicable law and applicable labor 
agreements.  Although th is commitment may be valuable, the Commission does not 
assign a direct monetary benefit to it.

VII. CONCLUSION    
For the reasons discussed in this Order, the Commission concludes that the 
benefits from the development and operat ion of the NECEC to Maine ratepayers and 
citizens significantly outweigh the costs and detriments of the Project.  In addition, the 
Commission concludes that the Stipulation, filed in this proceeding on February 21, 
2019, provides significant additional be nefits to Maine.  Accordingly, the Commission 
concludes that: (1) the NECEC meets the public need and public interest standards 
required by Title 35 -A, Section 3132 ; and (2) the Stipulation filed in this proceeding on 
February 21, 2019 satisfies the stipul ation approval criteria contained in Chapter 110, 
Section 8(D)(7) of the Commission rules.    
 
 Accordingly, the Commission

ORDER   101  Docket No. 2017 -00232  
 
 
 Concurring Opinion of Commissioner Williamson  
 
 I concur with the Commission’s decision in this proceeding.  I write separately on 
one point concerning the ratepayer benefits of NECEC.  I agree with the finding that the 
NECEC will provide clear benefits with respect to grid rel iability and fuel security.  The 
Commission’s decision, however , states that these benefits cannot be quantified.  That 
is the way that Figure I.1 had been presented.   
 
 Although I generally agree that certain other monetary benefits cannot be easily  
quantified, that is not the case here: there is a n empirical basis to assess the value of 
regional grid reliability and fuel security.  There is a price range estimate for the 
willingness to pay for fuel s ecurity in the New England r egion and , accordingly, a mean s 
to calculate the cost  (if fuel security were to be supplied without NECEC), or a benefit (if 
regional fuel security were to be augmented by NECEC) for Maine  ratepayers and 
electric customers .  
 
ISO-NE estimates that the Reliability Must Run ( RMR ) provisio ns related to the 
two Mystic units at the Boston load center will increase regional costs by approximately 
$102 million to $148 million per year during the two -year program.44 This amount is ISO-
NE’s willingness to pay for what it terms “fuel security” for the system we depend upon. 
Using the midpoint of the range as a conservative estimate, this means $123 million is 
the regional price tag for the value of system r eliability and wintertime f uel security . 
Because RMR costs are regionalized, the LNG -supplied Mystic units would cost Maine 
electric customers at least $9.8 million a year annually for the years 2023 -2024 and 
2024 -2025 .  Such additional costs could very well extend longer if natural gas pipeline 
development remains stalled in lower New England and ISO-NE continues to be short 
of fuel secure alternatives for winter reliability for several more winter periods .   
 
This level of annual cost represents the market value being assigned to the 
region’s winter fuel security problem right now for the time when  NECEC transmission 
could be available, or more technically, what certain costs to Maine customers could be 
avoided if the NECEC is put in-service on schedule.   This data should be reflected in 
our assessment.
