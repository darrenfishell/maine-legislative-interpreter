Emissions for Certain Electric Transmission Line Project ” (April 24 , 2023)  
 
 
Good afternoon, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and respective members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. My name is Paul Franceschi , 
I am a resident of Westbrook  and I am providing testimony tod ay on behalf of CIANBRO, my 
employer of 28 years and where I currently serve as Vice President and General Manager of 
Power and Energy , in opposition to LD -1658.   
 
CIANBRO is a 100% employee -owned construction and construction services firm 
headquartered in P ittsfield, Maine, routinely operating in over 40 States, employing over 4,000 
team members; over 1,300 of which are Maine residents.  
 
Predictability is a critical aspect of any development project. A developer needs to have some 
certainty that the rules of  the process will remain consistent as they work to m eet compliance 
points to move forward. This is especially necessary the more complex the project. The 
developer of the project this bill appears to be aimed at  received all of the required permits and 
met all of the regulatory benchmarks , including Federal, State, Regional and Local approval , 
satisfying the necessary steps as understood by all parties involved at the time.  
 
As written, this bill would only add more regulatory hurdles to an already exhaus ted project 
development process and more importantly, it would add those burdens  after -the-fact. With 
this said, this legislation seems unnecessary and a bad message to those considering investing 
in our State, thus a  policy proposal that the State of Maine should not engage in.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration of our position on this matter.
