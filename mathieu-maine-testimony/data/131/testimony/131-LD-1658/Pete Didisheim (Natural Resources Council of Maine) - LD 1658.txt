Testimony in Support 
”An Act to Verify the Reduction of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Certain Electric 
Transmission Line Projects" (LD 1658) 
Pete Didisheim 
Natural Resources Council of Maine 
April 24, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee. My name is Pete Didisheim, and I am the advocacy director for the 
Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM). NRCM is Maine's leading environmental advocacy 
organization with more than 25,000 members and supporters. I am testifying in support of LD 
1658. 
LD 1658 is a truth in advertising bill for the climate impacts associated with large transmission 
lines. The bill would require the owners of large transmission lines that are constructed 
primarily to transport electricity generated outside of the state to demonstrate whether the 
project contributes to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. If such reductions are 
not verified by an independent third-party analysis, then the Maine Department of 
Environmental Protection could impose fines. 
This is an accountability bill that would ensure that new transmission lines delivering electricity 
from outside of Maine into the New England grid are, in fact, providing climate benefits. 
The bill would have no impact on whether the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) is 
built. It would, however, require the owners of the NECEC, and any future such projects, verify 
through an independent, third-party analysis that the project would reduce ggaj greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
This is an important issue that has plagued the NECEC for more than five years, as it did the 
Northern Pass project in New Hampshire that was rejected by the New Hampshire Site 
Evaluation Committee because it was unclear whether the project would result in actual 
greenhouse gas emission reductions. ‘ 
During the Maine Public Utilities Commission's review of the NECEC, a study by London 
Economics International (LEI) concluded that the NECEC would contribute to regional 
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but LEI did not determine whether greenhouse gas 
emission reductions within the New England grid might be offset by increases in greenhouse 
gas emissions elsewhere. ("LEI did not monetize the social benefits of the CO2 emissions 
reductions, nor did it analyze the emissions changes in otherjurisdictions as a result of 
NECEC/’“)
This has long been a suspected possibility and deep concern because climate change is a global 
issue, and projects that don't demonstrate net additional reductions of greenhouse gas 
emissions are not relevant for addressing the problem. 
in 2019, this Committee was sufficiently concerned about the uncertainty of whether the 
NECEC would generate new, additional climate benefits that it passed a bill (LD 640) requiring 
that an independent study be done to determine the answer to this question. 
The Committee voted 10-3 for an amended version of LD 640, and then the Senate passed the 
bill 30-4. LD 640 was an emergency bill designed to deliver a much-needed, independent study 
on an expedited basis so it would not result in any delays for the project. However, CMP and 
affiliated lobbyists lobbied to defeat the study bill, and they succeeded. The House approved 
the measure 77-66, which was short of the two-thirds majority that would have been needed 
for the study to be done by the fall of 2019. 
lf the bill had passed, the people of Maine would have had an independent assessment of this 
core claim about the NECEC more than three and a half years ago. 
But the defeat of LD 640 in 2019 doesn't mean that verification of the climate impacts of this 
project, and future such projects, is not still relevant. It still is, very much so. 
Opponents of LD 640 said that Hydro-Quebec (HQ) had so much electricity that the company 
didn't know what to do with it all. They claimed that HQ literally was spilling water over its 
dams because it didn't have markets for the power."‘ Such claims were never verified because 
the study to do so was defeated. 
Yet, this winter Hydro~Quebec experienced electricity shortages that caused the company to 
urge residents of Quebec to restrict electricity consumption. ” Quebec had to import electricity 
from New England to satisfy energy demands. 
In fact, Quebec reportedly is moving from a period of surplus electricity to a period of 
shortages. According to media reports in Canada, "Quebec is shifting from years of power 
surpluses to shortfalls. Hydro-Québec's 2022-2026 strategic plan estimates Quebec will not 
have enough capacity to meet demand starting in 2027."" 
The New England Power Generators Association (NEPGA) reported that during a February cold 
snap this winter, New England was sending 1,000MW to Quebec to meet their electricity needs 
This sudden change left the NEPGA to wonder: ”The Region Needs to Revisit Long-Held 
Assumptions. ” (see attached) 
This information raises legitimate concerns about whether the power that would be delivered 
through the NECEC will result in actual reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, or 
whether electricity shortfalls in Quebec might require increases in generation from fossil fuel 
sources, and even increases in electricity imports from New England.
Such claims need to be verified. It matters where the power is coming from. If a project is sold 
as being good for the climate, then such claims should be independently verified. 
That is why NRCM supports the general concept of this bill. However, we suggest that it be 
amended to include the basic structure of the amended version of LD 640.“ Specifically, the 
study should be done within one year of initial operations but should involve a modeled 
analysis over the first 10-year period of the contract, and the modeled analysis should be 
compared with the amount of global greenhouse gas emission reductions claimed in the 
project's permit applications. 
I appreciate this opportunity to provide testimony on LD 1658 and would be glad to answer any 
questions you may have.

"As to the savings associated with a decrease in carbon emissions, we agree with Counsel for the Public that no 
actual greenhouse gas emission reductions would be realized if no new source of hydropower is introduced and 
the power delivered by the Project to New England is simply diverted from Ontario or New York. The record is 
unclear as to whether the hydropower is new or will be diverted from another region." New Hampshire Site

An Act to Verify the Reduction of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Certain 
Electric Transmission Line Projects 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §487-A, sub-§5 is enacted to read: 
5. Nonessential transmission lines; reduction of global greenhouse qas emissions 
Notwithstanding an\Lprovision of law to the contrary, a permit issued under this article for a nonessential 
transmission line is conditioned on the owner of the transmission line, no later than one year after the 
transmission line achieves commercial operation, submitting to the department documentation, analysis or 
other informatiomprepared by an independent 3rd party_, that demonstrates to the department's satisfaction 
that the transmission line and the electricity it transports contributes to the reduction of qlobal greenhouse 
gas emissions. As used in this subsection. "nonessential transmission line" means a permanently installed 
transmission line carrying 100 kilovolts or more that is constructed primarily to transport electricity generated 
outside of the State and that achieves commercial operation after January 1. 2024.

D. Failure of the owner of a nonessential transmission line to submit the documentation, analysis or other 
information that demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that the transmission line and the electricity it 
transports contributes to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions constitutes a violation of the 
permit issued under this article and the department shall take appropriate action in accordance with section 
347-A, which may include. but is not limited to. entry of an administrative consent agreement requiring the 
owner to pay to the department penalties calculated in proportion to the amount of electricity transported 
using the transmission line that. in the department's determination. does not contribute to the reduction of 
global greenhouse qas emissions. 
E,G= Notwithstanding any_provision of law to the contrary, if pursuant to a violation under paragraph A. the 
department requires the owner of a nonessential transmission line to palpenalties in accordance with section 
347-A or 349. the department shall transfer those penalty amounts to the Efficiency Maine Trust established 
in Title 35-A, section 10103 for deposit in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund established in 
Title 35-A. section 10109 or another fund as determined by the department. 
FD. The department shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted pursuant to this 
paragraph are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375. subchapter 2-A. 
For the purposes of this section, "greenhouse gas" has the same meaning as in the Maine Revised Statutes, 
Title 38, section 574, subsection 1.’
