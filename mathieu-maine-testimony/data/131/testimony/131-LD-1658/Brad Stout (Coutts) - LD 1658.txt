LD-1658, â€œAn Act to Verify the Reduction of Global Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions for Certain Electric Transmission Line Project" (April 24, 2023) 
Good afternoon, Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and respective members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. |\/ly name is Brad Stout, I am 
a resident of Yarmouth and President and CEO of Coutts. I am providing testimony today in 
opposition to LD-1658. 
Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Randolph, Maine, Coutts is celebrating over half a century of 
providing electrical construction/maintenance services to utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and 
the private sector throughout the Northeast. 
As written, and with current circumstances as they are, this bill seems to be targeted at one particular 
project. That alone should warrant concern. From our experience, public policy initiatives focusing on 
single industries, or individual projects as the case may be here, rarely have positive intent or results. 
This Legislation creates additional regulatory hurdles after the project developer met all permitting 
requirement throughout the process, including approval from local, state, regional and federal 
sources. These compliance benchmarks were understood from the outset and were adhered to at each 
step in the process. To change the rules, adding more regulatory burdens to a process that is nearing 
its completion seems unwarranted at best. This is not a good look for Maine and in our opinion 
certainly not in the spirit of good public policy. 
Thank you for you consideration ofour perspective on the matter.
