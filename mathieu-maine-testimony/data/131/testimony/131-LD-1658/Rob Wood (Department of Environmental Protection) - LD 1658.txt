Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Rob 
Wood, Director of the Bureau of Land Resources at the Department of Environmental 
Protection, speaking in opposition to L.D. 1658. 
L.D. 1658 would amend the Site Location of Development Act to require that any permit 
issued for a nonessential transmission line, as defined in the bill, must be conditioned 
on its owner demonstrating that the transmission line and the electricity it transports 
contributes to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. This requirement

L.D. 1658: An Act to Verify the Reduction of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Certain Electric 
Transmission Line Projects

Public Hearing: April 24, 2023

would apply to projects achieving commercial operation after January 1, 2024, even if 
the Department has already issued a permit for such a project. 
The Department has two related concerns with this bill. First is the retroactive nature of 
the proposal. The bill would amend a permit that the Department issued several years 
ago for the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line. The Department 
already found that the NECEC project was permittable under Site Law, subject to the 
conditions in the permit order issued in May 2020. Under Title 38, section 344 of the 
Maine Revised Statutes and Chapter 2 of the Department's rules, a permit application 
must be processed under the substantive rules in effect on the date the application is 
determined complete for processing. L.D. 1658 would subject a project to new 
Department rules years after the Department processed the application. 
Second, we are concerned that the bill would establish a new permitting standard in the 
form of a permit condition, rather than changing the underlying permitting standards. 
There is a subtle but important distinction between permitting standards and permit 
conditions. Standards govern whether a project can be permitted, whereas permit 
conditions are established to provide assurance that a project will in fact meet the 
underlying standards. lf nonessential transmission lines must achieve global 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions to be permittable, the appropriate way to address 
this is to establish a new permitting standard, such that a project cannot be permitted 
unless the applicant provides evidence in its application that it will meet the standard. 
The only reason to structure the requirement as a permit condition tied to commercial 
operation of the project, rather than an underlying permitting standard that applicants 
must address in their permit applications, is so the condition can be added to the 
NECEC permit since the project has not yet achieved commercial operation. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer questions 
of the Committee, both now and at work session.
