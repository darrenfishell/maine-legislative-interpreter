MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
SUBJECT LD 1624, An Act to Streamlme the Process for Amendmg a B1rth Certlﬁcate of an Adult 
When Genetlc Parentage 1s Not D1sputed 
Commlttee Cha1r Senator Carney, Comm1ttee Chart Representatwe Moonen and d1stmgu1shed 
members of the Jomt Standmg Comrmttee on Jud1c1a1y, 
What a d1fference a day makes Actually, how much dlfference does a smgle day make‘? If you area 
parent who Was never put on the bnth cernﬁcate of your ch1ld, a smgle day can mean the dlfference of 
hundreds of dollars and a lot of unnecessary hassle 
Imaglne 1f you and your partner have a baby together but never end up marned and dec1de, for 
whatever reason or crrcumstances, to co-parent your ch11d wh11e 11v1ng separately As long as you 
malntam an amrable relatlonshlp, agree to provlde mutual support for the welfare and beneﬁt of the 
m1nor ch1ld, and as long as there 1s no d1spute on the parentage of the ch1ld 1n quesnon (thereby not 
necessltatmg any test requlred to enforce support) only the name of the blologlcal mother has to be 
l1sted on the blrth certrﬁcate The b1olog1cal father can be added to the bnth certrﬁcate at any t1me 
s1mply from voluntary wntten statements 1f the parentage 1s undlsputed 1n accordance w1th T1t1e 22 
§2761 or §2761-B 
That 1s, the name can be added unt1l the chlld turns 18 Once the chlld turns 18, m order to amend the 
bnth cemﬁcate, not only does 1t requlre a statement of the now adult ch11d but also a DNA test of the 
parent whose name they w1sh to appear on the amended b1rth cert1ﬁcate Th1s has to be done even 1f 1t 
1s agreeable to all part1es lnvolved and there 1s no d1spute about the b1olog1ca1 parentage of the person 
to be amended

What makes th1s requrrement more puzzlmg 1s that the requnement for a DNA test rs 
not requrred for a mmor chlld, when there may be an lssue of enforcmg support, but 1s 
requrred for an adult chrld when the 1ssue 0fpI‘OV1d111g support for the ch1ld 1s much less 
hkely to be an 1ssue 
Th1s rssue was brought to my attentron when a constltuent called to 1nform me that he 
wanted to amend h1s daughter ’s b1rth cert1ﬁcate to mclude h1s name I have known th1s 
gentleman and h1s daughter for years There has never been any doubt that he was the 
brologrcal father of h1s daughter and I have watched l'11I11 co-parent h1s daughter w1th the 
ch1ld’s mother As my constltuent had marned w1th1n the last few years, was gettmg 
older, had solrdrﬁed h1s career and was now won-red about h1s estate planmng he wanted 
to add h1s name to h1s daughter ’s bnth certlﬁcate Th1s was somethmg that he, h1s 
daughter and hrs daughter ’s mother all wanted When he called the Bureau of Vrtal 
Statrstlcs he was mformed that s1nce h1s daughter had Just turned 18 he was now requlred 
to take a DNA test Upon 1nvest1gat1on he found that the test was gomg to cost h1m 1n 
excess of $500 
He called me and asked why th1s was 1n statute and I had no answer for h1m I called 
the Bureau and after talkrng to several people I was told that the Bureau could not tell me 
the _]11S'£1 ﬁC8.'E10I1 for th1s portron of the law or why 1t had been enacted 
All thlngs be1ng equal, I am ask1ng the comrmttee to consrder my b1l1wh1ch would 
change the requrrement for a DNA test only when the b1olog1cal parentage of the person 
who wants to be amended to the bnth certrﬁcate 1s d1sputed 
What drfference can a day make’? Hopefully today can make a b1g drfference 1n the 
hves of some of our c1t1zens savmg them hundreds of dollars w1th a slmple, common 
sense vote of ‘Ought To Pass’ I thank you for your tune and w1J1 gladly answer any 
quest1ons to my ab111ty 
Respectfully,
