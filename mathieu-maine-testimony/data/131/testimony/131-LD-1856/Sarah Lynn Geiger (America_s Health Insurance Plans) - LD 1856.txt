RE' AHIP Comments on L D 1856, A Resolutron to Study the Establrshment of a MarneCare 
Publrc Health Plan 
To Charrs Senator Barley, Representatrve Perry and Members of the J ornt Health Coverage, Insurance, 
and Fmancral Servrces Commrttee, 
Amer1ca’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and our members are wrrtmg to respectfully express our 
opposrtron to LD 1856, wluch would drrect the Ofﬁce of Affordable Health Care, rn consultatron wrth the 
Department of Health and Human Servrces to study the optrons for establrshrng a MarneCare publrc 
health plan The report, wrth recommendatrons, must be submrtted to tlns commrttee no later than 
January 31, 2024 
Every Amerrcan deserves affordable coverage and hrgh-qualrty health care AHIP shares the Cormn1ttee ’s 
goal to make health care more affordable for all Mamers by delrverrng more chorces and better qualrty at 
lower costs However, completely overhaulrng Mame’s health care system rnto a one-srze- ﬁts-all 
govermnent rnsurance system does not address the underlyrng costs of health care rn the state 
Favorabrlrty for our current health care system has rmproved as lawmakers burlt on our current system to 
lower costs and expand access to care 1 
A recent poll shows that an rncreasrng majorrty of voters prefer 
burldmg on what’s workmg rn health care, earmng more support than any govemrnent-run health care 
proposal 2 
Even more voters report they are unwrllrng to pay more for health care to create a new 
government health rnsurance system We should focus on rmprovrng what’s workmg whrle ﬁxmg what rs 
broken to lower costs and expand access to affordable, hrgh-qualrty coverage for everyone 
Efforts to enact a publzc optron health care system on a state level have proved unworkable
l 
States that have attempted to enact statewrde government-run health care systems have formd them 
rmpossrble to rmplement on a state level 
In Vermont, the govemment had to abandon rts efforts to rnstrtute a srngle-payer system after predrctrng 
that they would need to rnstrtute a new employer payroll tax of ll 5 percent and an rndrvrdual mcome tax 
of up to 9 5 percent to ﬁnance the program, whrle projectrng that the program would save only 1 6 percent

Former Governor Peter Shumlrn argued that the current health care structure 1n the Unrted 
States makes rt drfﬁcult to enact srngle-payer on a state level because a vast majorrty of people are 
covered through employer-sponsored rnsurance, whrch 1s tax deductrble 4 
It 1s drfﬁcult, he noted, to 
transrtron those people to a smgle-payer system because they are reapmg more beneﬁts under the current 
system, and therr taxes wrll mcrease substantrally under smgle-payer He belreves that no state can 
rmplement a smgle-payer system wrthout substantral federal reforms 
In 2016, Coloradans defeated Amendment 69, a ballot mrtratrve to enact a srngle-payer system The 
1n1t1at1ve lncluded new taxes for employers and rndrvrduals, whrch would have nearly doubled state 
government spendmg 5 
The Colorado Health Instrtute predrcted that the program would slrde mto ever- 
rncreasrng deﬁcrts unless taxes were rncreased because the program’s revenues would not be sufﬁcrent to 
keep up wrth rncreasrng health care costs6 
In addrtron, to rmplement a smgle-payer system lrke the one envrsroned 1n S-572, the state would have to 
apply for numerous warvers from the federal government relatmg to Medrcard, CHIP, Medrcare, and the 
commercral market None of the exrstrng warvers rs meant to rmplement tlns type of system and rt rs 
unknown whether the federal government would approve warvers for such an effort or fund such a broad 
expanslon of state governrnent-run health care coverage 
Government-run health care systems do nothmg to mcrease access to health care 
The data suggests that countrres wrth smgle-payer systems must generally spend even more to provrde 
therr crtrzens wrth better access to care In 2022, Canadran specralrst physrcrans report a medran wartrng 
trme of 27 4 weeks between referral from a general practrtroner and recerpt of treatment — up from the 
wart of 25 6 weeks reported rn 2021 7 
Movrng to a one-srze- ﬁts-all government rnsurance system wrll 
lead to less competrtron, less rrmovatron, and less efﬁcrent health care wrth hrgher taxes and costs for all 
Marne famrlres and employers Srmply, 1t would lead Marners to pay more to wart longer for worse care 
Srnce the start of the COVID-19 pandemrc 1n March 2020, the headlmes have been clear — health care 
access rs at rts breakrng pornt A recent poll found that consumers were most concemed that government- 
run health care proposals would lnnrt access to qualrty care8 
Mame has done a tremendous amount of work to ensure patrents get access to trmely, qualrty care 
Imposmg a srngle-payer health care system could harm these exrstrng consumer protectrons mstead For 
rnstance, rt could destabrlrze rural hosprtals and other health care provrders by generatrng untenable large 
new blocks of buslness at below-commercral market levels of rermbursement We must focus on ﬁllrng 
the gaps 1n the current health care system, rncludrng rnvestmg 1n workforce development and rncreasrng 
access to care rn rural areas, but thrs b11l does nothrng to address those rssues 
Government-run health care systems wzll razse costs for consumers and employers

Under govemment-run health care systems, the government 1s the sole ﬁnancer of health care servrces 
Srgnrﬁcant new taxes w11l be needed to ﬁll the ﬁnancral gap left by the e11m1nat1on of market-drrven 
health care premrunrdollars, and other cost pressures endured by the health delrvery system as well 
Expenence and research show that that elrmmatmg a market-dnven system rs npe for cost overruns, 
whrch then necessltates more fundmg through hlgher taxes 
For example, 1n 2017, the RAND Corporatron estrmated that fmancmg a slngle-payer system 1n Oregon 
would requrre mcreases 1n personal mcome taxes by 6-8 percent and rncreased employer payroll taxes for 
all busmesses w1th over 20 workers 9 ' 
Addltlonally, m Cahforma, the Legrslatlve Analyst’s Ofﬁce estrmated that enactrng a smgle-payer system 
1n Cahforma could cost around $400 b1ll1on annually and requrre new state tax revenues 1n the low 
hundreds of brllrons of dollars 1° 
Sponsors of the1r farled smgle-payer leglslatlon proposed new exclse 
taxes, payroll taxes, and personal mcome taxes to pay for therr program, w1th no data to show that the 
proposal could even be rmplemented or would save money 
Hundreds of thousands of Mamers have affordable health care coverage they value where they get the 
care they need when they need 1t — from the best doctors and l'l0Spl'[8.1S m the world We should therefore 
focus on burldrng upon and rmprovmg what 1s workrng whrle ﬁxmg what 1s broken 1n health care AHIP 
and 1ts members know aspects of the dellvery of health care can be rmproved and we ﬁrmly belreve that 
when the free market and publrc programs work together, we can expand access to affordable, h1gh- 
quahty coverage for all Mamers A complete overhaul of the health care system 1s the wrong approach 
For these reasons, we oppose LD 1856 and ask the Commlttee not to pass th1s b11l/
/ 
Addrtronally, the Commrttee has held a publ1c hearrng on LD 1387, an\act estabhshmg smgle-payer 
health care msurance for chrldren aged 19 and younger, on May 9‘“ , and 1t 1s scheduled for an upcom1ng 
work sessron on May 17“ By pulhng all chlldren out of the rlsk pool, causmg a srgmﬁcant drsruptron 1n 
the commerclal msurance market, premrums w1l1 rncrease w1th no evldence that thrs W111 rmprove the 
overall health of Ma1ne’s youngest resrdents We encourage the comm1ttee to conslder the 1mp11cat1ons of 
such legrslatron that we have 1a1d out throughout thrs letter as LD 1856 and LD 1387 move through the 
legrslatlve process 
Thank you for your consrderatron of these comments Our members stand ready and eager to work w1th 
polrcymakers and other stakeholders to make coverage more affordable, but we must do so 1n ways that 
do not destabrlrze an already fraglle health care system Thank you very much for your consrderatlon of 
our comments . 
Smcerely,
