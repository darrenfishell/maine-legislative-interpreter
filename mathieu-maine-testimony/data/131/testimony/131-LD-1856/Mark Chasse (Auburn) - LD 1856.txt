LD 1856 ought-NOT-to pass UNLESS the State of Maine opens up unhindered 
insurance offering practices to Maine residents by eliminating mandatory mimimum 
premiums.
Several years ago i was able to purchase catastrophic health insurance for $70 per 
month while - after moving to Maine - the same insurance minimum premium was 
several hundred dollars more. Let the free market work.
Thank you.
