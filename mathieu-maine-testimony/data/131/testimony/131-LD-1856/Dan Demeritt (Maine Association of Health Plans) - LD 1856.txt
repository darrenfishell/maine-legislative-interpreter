In Opposmon to LD 1856 
Resolve, to Study the Establlshment of a Ma1neCare Pubhc Health Plan 
Senator Ba1ley, Representat1ve Perry, and Members of the Jo1nt Standmg Comm1ttee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Fmanc1alServ1ces 
My name 1s Dan Demerrtt, the Execut1ve D1rector of the Mame Assoc1at10n of Health Plans 
(MeAHP) Our member health msurance camers prov1de or admmlster health msurance 
coverage to about 600,000 Mame people Our m1ss1on as an assoclatlon 1s to 1mprove the health 
of Mame people by promotmg affordable, safe, and coordmated healthcare 
The Ma1ne Assoclatlon of Health Plans opposes the creat1on of a publlc health plan under 
MameCare It would undermlne our prlvate msurance market and place even further pressure on 
health msurance prem1ums 
To the extent there 1s a need to know more about What Mame’s optlons are for a publlc health 
plan, a mechan1sm 1s already m place for those d1SCl.1SS101'1S 
As the Executlve D1rector of the Offlce of Affordable Health Care has shared Wrth the 
comrnrttee, her offlce has already been dlrected to analyze several pol1cy optrons, mcludmg the 
1ntroduct10n of a publ1c optlon plan to the Commlttee by January 1, 2024 1 
The Mame 
Assoclatlon of Health Plans and our members look forward to part1c1patmg m these 
conversatlons 
LD 1856 would b1as or at least dlrect much of the focus of th1s work to one outcome -- a pubhc 
health plan through MameCare For th1s reason, we urge a vote of Ought Not to Pass
