Republican Cory R.
LD 1247
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury, and members of the distinguished 
Committee on Judiciary. My name is Cory Reynolds. I am submitting testimony in 
opposition to LD 1247. Our Law Enforcement risk their lives every day to protect 
everyone. I Believe in Law & Order there is no problem Racial Justice and Social 
Issues the problem is if your a criminal you need to do the time. if your going to shoot
at an officer they are going to fight back to protect them and the community. So I 
would like you to vote in opposition to not pass. 
Thank You,
Republican Cory R.
