RE: LD 219 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, I'm Representative Dick Bradstreet. I 
represent House District 61, which is comprised of my home town of Vassalboro and most of 
Sidney. I am here today to present to you LD 219, An Act to Promote Equity in the Permitting 
Appeals Process. 
The impetus for this proposal occurred when I was talking with some people here in 
Augusta about how the issuance of some necessary DEP permits for particular projects were 
appealed and eventually tied up in the courts until the time allowed by the permits had expired, 
thus making the permits invalid. Essentially, parties were running the clock out and instead of 
having projects evaluated on their merits, they were stopped on what are essentially 
technicalities. I don't believe that is proper and that issue should be addressed. That situation 
will be taken care of in Section 5, where the bill speaks to tolling of deadlines. The rest of the 
changes in the current law that you see before you are essentially clarifications to make the law 
easier to understand and give more clarity to the appeals process. 
What I'm hoping for is that passage of the bill will accomplish several goals. It will bring 
clarity to the appeals process in places where there is currently some ambiguity; it will provide 
better alignment with the appeals process, the department and the applicant; it will establish 
clear rules during the appeals process to which all parties must adhere; and it will help align 
timing of renewals/re-applications with the process, thus eliminating excessive administrative 
work. It will also give DEP staff more time to manage other administrative functions and not 
get bogged down in repetitive and/or duplicative processes.

My limited knowledge of this subject makes me a less than perfect candidate to answer 
what must be the considerable number of questions you will undoubtedly have. lam more 
than happy to defer to much more qualified people who will be coming behind me to answer 
those questions. l would certainly like to express my appreciation to those who have worked to 
bring this bill to its current form. Some ofthe parties this bill will affect, the DEP and the 
Governor's office have been more than helpful in bringing the bill to this point. In that regard, I 
hope you will look favorably on LD 219, and I thank you for your time and attention.
