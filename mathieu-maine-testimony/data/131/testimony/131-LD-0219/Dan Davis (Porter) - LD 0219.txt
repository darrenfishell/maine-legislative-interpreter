LD 219
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members ENR Committee,
I represent no entity or agency and cannot take a position on LD219 as it includes no 
body of legislative work to review. 
I do however support SP0010 to eliminate concept drafts such as this, as these 
'markers' or 'slots' undermine democracy, paralyze participation, reduce FOAA 
transparency, and strain credibility and public trust in the State.
Let's do the work first, present it, openly participate, deliberate, then decide.
Thanks
