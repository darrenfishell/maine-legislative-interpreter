TESTIMONY OF 
KEVIN MARTIN 
DIRECTOR, POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION 
MAINE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF L.D. 219 
AN ACT TO PROMOTE EQUITY IN THE PERMITTING APPEALS PROCESS 
PRESENTED BY REP. BRADSTREET 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE 
ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
DATE OF HEARING: 
APRIL 20, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, I am Kevin Martin, 
Policy Director for the Department of Environmental Protection, speaking in support of L.D. 
219 as amended. 
Through the proposed amendment language, the bill attempts to accomplish three goals. First, 
the bill makes explicit the Department ’s ability to act on a license during the pendency ofa 
judicial appeal. Second, the bill clariﬁes when appellants, respondents, and Department staff may 
submit supplemental evidence during Board appeal proceedings. Lastly the bill allows tolling of 
deadlines established by a permit, license, or action under appeal, during the pendency of that 
appeal.

L.D. 219 — An Act to Promote Equity in the Permitting Appeals Process

The Department supports the goals of the bill, especially the clarity it provides regarding the 
Departments authority to act relative to court jurisdiction over a matter. This bill conﬁrms the 
ability of the Department to fulﬁll the terms of a license, including acting on additional 
applications and issuing orders conﬁrming compliance with conditions, while the merits of the 
underlying order might be in lengthy litigation. In addition, the bill conﬁrms both the 
Commissioner ’s authority to revoke or suspend licenses, and the Board of Environmental 
Protection ’s authority to modify or issue corrective actions regarding a permit under judicial 
appeal. This language does not grant the Department any additional authority, it merely codiﬁes 
its current understanding of the Law. In most cases, licensees are authorized to proceed with the 
project while a judicial appeal plays out. The continued ability to act on matters concerning a 
license, including compliance with conditions, is essential to ensuring the effectiveness of the 
permit and continued protection of the environment and the continued ability to act on 
subsequent matters forms a critical component allowing a licensee and the Department to 
respond to matters as they occur and adapt to necessary changes. 
The Department also supports the clarity provided regarding the ability of Department staff to 
respond to supplemental evidence and issues raised on Board appeals. Appellants before the 
Board often raise different concerns than those presented in public comments, and in the case of 
newly represented Appellants, raise new legal issues requiring a response from the Board. 
Requiring timely submission of those issues and allowing subsequent opportunity for 
respondents and Department staff to supplement the record in response promotes fairness in the 
process and a more informed decision by the Board. 
Lastly, the bill as currently drafted would capture terms, conditions, and deadlines wherea 
submission date has been laid out in the Department decision and provide the Department with 
discretion to toll those deadlines for the pendency of the judicial appeal. In effect, this provision 
would provide ﬂexibility for licensees who choose not to proceed during the judicial appeal 
period and provide relief from many Department deadlines. Its unlikely this provision would 
affect certain terms incorporating federal deadlines via delegated programs, but it would make 
available relief from many conditions requiring actions be performed by a date certain or from 
strict expiration deadlines for starting and ﬁnishing construction of a project. As an example, 
projects approved under the Natural Resources Protection Act or the Site Location of 
Development Law are granted licenses with standard conditions requiring start of construction 
within four years. That deadline could be tolled during a multi-year appeal period to prevent an 
unreasonably short window for a licensee to begin construction following their pennits being 
upheld. 
I thank you for you time and am happy to answer any questions both now and at work session.
