Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
990:
“An
Act
to
Authorize
State
Special
Purpose
Depository
Institutions
for
Digital
Assets”
Good
Morning
Senator
Bailey,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Maine
Legislature's
Committee
on
Health
Coverage,
Insurance,
and
Financial
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
990.
Maine
is
uniquely
positioned
to
benefit
from
the
world
of
digital,
decentralized
financial
services.
As
many
from
the
big
cities
of
the
northeast
have
sought
more
space
and
security,
Maine
has
become
a
destination
for
remote
workers.
With
LD
990,
we
will
invite
crypto
entrepreneurs
from
all
over
the
country
to
experience
the
beauty
of
Maine
while
building
their
business.
Passing
this
bill
would
be
a
small
but
meaningful
signal
to
a
budding
industry
that
Maine
is
welcome
to
innovation.
Other
states,
like
Wyoming,
are
already
moving
faster,
exempting
crypto
transactions
from
money
transmission
rules
and
fees,
in
its
attempts
to
attract
these
entrepreneurs.
Some
states,
like
Florida,
are
even
looking
into
accepting
tax
payments
in
certain
cryptocurrencies.
The
potential
economic
and
social
benefits
of
the
application
of
decentralized
blockchain
technology
are
unfathomable.
The
next
wave
of
digital
services
will
likely
be
built
on
applications
using
virtual
currencies,
as
blockchain-based
applications
often
utilize
a
monetized
token
to
participate
in
the
network.
Permitting
certain
Maine
banks
to
carry
virtual
currency
would
open
up
our
state
to
that
immense
potential.
Of
course,
getting
involved
in
any
sort
of
currency
or
asset
trading
can
be
risky,
as
with
any
financial
instrument,
even
US
Treasury
bonds.
This
bill
has
been
thoughtfully
crafted,
requiring
these
Special
Purpose
Depository
Institutions
(SPDIs)
to
hold
100%
reserves
ensures
that
consumers
will
be
sufficiently
protected
from
potential
risk.
We
can
put
Maine
on
the
map
for
this
new
and
exciting
arena
of
finance
by
passing
LD
990.
Please
deem
it
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
show
the
nation
that
Maine
is
open
and
welcoming
to
innovative
financial
services.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
