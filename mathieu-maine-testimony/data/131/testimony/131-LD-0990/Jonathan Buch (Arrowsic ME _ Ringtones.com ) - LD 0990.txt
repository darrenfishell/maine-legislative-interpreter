I am building a digital store on the premium domain Ringtones.com. The store will 
help mobile users around the world to customize their mobile experience with 
Ringtones, Wallpapers & more. All of the content is officially licensed meaning that 
licensors including US record labels & content owners like artists & publishers are 
compensated per digital sale. 
Digital Assets are already utilized by tens of millions of people within a variety of 
Sports, Entertainment & Gaming Platforms. 
Use cases for Digital Assets on Ringtones.com might include accepting Digital Assets
as payments or selling Digital Assets like Ringtones on Blockchain for fiat currency. 
A Digital Asset such as a Ringtone sold as a Non Fungible Token and used in a VR 
Gaming Environment. 
Digital Assets help transact & settle real world value in a streamlined, transparent 
manner. 
The recent bank crisis exposed banks for gambling with deposits and the FDIC for 
lacking funds. It also highlighted the the integral role of US Dollar Pegged, US Based 
Stablecoins (particularly USDC) and the need for transparency, especially in 
regarding reserves. 
Maine should be proactive about setting financial standards that safeguard depositors 
to the fullest extent possible while discouraging insured "banks" from behaving like 
casinos. 
Maine has the opportunity to embrace new economic opportunities driven by 
blockchain in a responsible manner.
Regulatory Uncertainty & Regulation by Enforcement is driving businesses and 
entrepreneurs out of the US. 
The public lack of confidence in banking and fiat dollars is at least partly attributable 
to the lack of money to cover insured deposits at traditional banks.  
I am in favor of allowing authorized financial institutions in Maine to accept deposits 
of cryptocurrencies with 100% reserve requirements.
