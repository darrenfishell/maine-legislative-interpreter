LD 325 - An Act To Require Transparency in Transmission and Distribution Utility Advertising 
Expenditures 
February 16, 2023 
Testifying: Neither for nor against 
Senator Lawrence, Representative Zeigler, Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
Utilities and Technology, my name is Kathleen Newman, submitting testimony neither for nor 
against LD 325 - An Act To Require Transparency in Transmission and Distribution Utility 
Advertising Expenditures. 
This bill defines “related entity” and requires CMP to file an annual report with the Commission if 
such entities engage in advertising or political activities targeting Maine residents. CMP provides 
such information to the Commission annually through our Chapter 83 report which is available 
on the MPUC website. 
The requirement that we provide information on the advertising and political activities of the 40 
membership organizations to which we belong is not practicable.  Though we are happy to 
provide the Commission with a list of those organizations, we would not be able to compel those 
entities to comply with that requirement. 
CMP expects that this bill is actually trying to capture information about contributions our parent 
company has made to political action committees. Information about those contributions is 
readily available publicly. The company is in compliance with all related rules and has been 
completely transparent in regular reports to the Maine Ethics Commission. 
All of CMP’s political and charitable contributions and goodwill advertising spending are made 
with shareholder – not ratepayer – money.  We are completely transparent in reporting those 
below-the-line expenditures and, as a regulated entity, obligated to be comprehensively 
responsive to anything the Commission wants to see.   
Thank you for your consideration.
