To:Members of the Joint Committee on Energy, Utilitiesand TechnologyFrom:Ania Wright, Political and Legislative SpecialistDate:February 15, 2023Re:Testimony inSupport of LD 325: An Act To RequireTransparency in Transmission andDistribution Utility Advertising Expenditures
 Senator Lawrence, Representative Ziegler, and the members of the Joint Committee on Energy,Utilities and Technology,
I am testifying today on behalf of Sierra Club Maine, representing over 22,000 supporters andmembers statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra Club is one of our nation’s oldest and largestenvironmental organizations. We work diligently to amplify the power of our 3.8 million membersnation-wide as we work towards combating climate change and promoting a just and sustainableeconomy. To that end, we urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 325: An Act to RequireTransparency in Transmission Distribution Utility Advertising Expenditures.
Political transparency is critical to Maine’s democracy. LD 325 would expand utility reporting toinclude not only political spending but also “charitable” and “educational” spending, which alsoincludes parent companies and affiliates. Adding these reporting attributes will increasetransparency and help the PUC make sure expenditures are not costing ratepayers.
Political spending and advertising for the ballot question “Act To Create the Pine Tree PowerCompany, a Nonprofit, Customer-owned Utility” is a prime example of how the lack of transparencyfrom utility companies is misleading to Maine voters. To date, over 10.5 million dollars have beenspent by the organization Maine Affordable Energy in opposition to the ballot proposal according toMaine Ethics1. Maine Affordable Energy, which claimsto be a ‘community organization’ according toits Facebook page,2is wholly funded by Central MainePower’s corporate parent, Avangrid,according to reports filed at the Maine Ethics Commission3.Without transparent reporting fromCMP as well as all of its affiliated interests, including charitable and educational giving, everydayMainers will be led astray and be unable to make an informed decision about utility issues.
While direct spending on lobbying and on ballot questions is reported under current law to theEthics Commission, and direct lobbying by CMP is included in annual reports to the PUC underMRSA Title 35-A, Section 302, influence campaigns by public utilities and their parents have becomefar more multilayered and multifaceted since Section 302 was written in 1987. At that time, CMPwas one entity, and was locally owned.  Today, both Versant and CMP are owned internationally,

with multiple intermediary holding companies, and many affiliates. Only by updating our laws, andthe PUC rules, can Mainers know how our “public utilities” are seeking to influence public opinion,and know with certainty that our rates are not being used to fund political activities.
Maine ratepayers deserve comprehensive, accurate reporting about how utilities are attempting tobuy influence with them, amidst continuing to increase their rates and provide some of the worstservice in the United States4. It is our positionthat it should be the responsibility of the utilities toreport more fully on their political and advertising activities so that ratepayers, the PUC, and theState of Maine can be informed about the influence of utilities in Maine. To that end, we urgeunanimous support for LD 325. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,Ania Wright--Political and Legislative SpecialistSierra Club Maine Chapter
