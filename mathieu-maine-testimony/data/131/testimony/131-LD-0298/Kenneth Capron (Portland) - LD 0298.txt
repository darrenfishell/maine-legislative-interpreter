Economic Efficiency
•Better link use and payment
•Efficient ways of collecting payment (utility bill)

MUNICIPALITY OBJECTIVES
City Council appointed “Transportation Finance Committee” in 1999 to 
address challenges associated with transportation financing for new infrastructure and ongoing O&M.
COMMITTEE INCLUDED: 
3 City Council members | 3 members of the development community | 3 
citizens | 2 consultants 
RECOMMENDATIONS
Invest ++ funds to increase frequency for each street from 7 to 10 years:• Increase annual street maintenance funding by $800K to $2.7M (30%)• Imposing “Street Maintenance Fee” on each property. Calculations 
included Traffic Volume and
Truck Traffic for separate uses.LOVELAND, CO

…that reflects
