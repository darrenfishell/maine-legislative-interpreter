The Honorable Cameron Reny
, Senate Chair 
The Honorable
Allison Hepler,
House Chair 
Committee on Marine Resources 
100 State House Station 
Augusta, ME 04333-0100 
 
Senator Reny, Representative Hepler, Honorable Members of the Committee on Marine Resources.
My
name
is
Liz
MacDonald
and
I
am
a
representative
of
Atlantic
Sea
Farms.
I
want
to
testify
in
strong
opposition
to
LD
487 
“An Act to Establish Coastal Waters and Submerged Lands Regional Planning Commissions”.
Our
mission
at
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
is
focused
on
providing
diversified
income
opportunities
for
Maine
fishermen
through
kelp 
farming.
We
work
with
30
farmers
throughout
the
coast
of
Maine
–
most
of
whom
are
commercial
fishermen
or
professional 
aquaculturists.
With
our
partner
farmers
we
are
building
and
scaling
an
entirely
new
industry
for
Maine
and
even
in
these
early 
stages,
are
the
leading
representative
of
kelp
cultivation
in
the
U.S.,
putting
our
state
on
the
map
for
yet
another
healthy
and 
sustainable
ocean
product.
Our
kelp
farming
industry
helps
fishermen
diversify
when
they
would
otherwise
be
almost 
completely
dependent
on
a
lobster
monoculture.
In
the
past
three
years,
and
as
a
result
of
these
partnerships,
the
US’ 
sustainable
kelp
aquaculture
sector
has
been
led
by
Maine’s
hard
working
fishermen
with
4-12
acre
leases
-
not
by
big 
corporate
interest
from
out
of
state
or
large
off-shore
farms
in
California.
In
2021
Maine
fishermen
in
partnership
with
Atlantic 
Sea
Farms
represented
85%
of
the
line
grown
domestic
seaweed
industry.
In
addition
to
the
economic
development
benefits, 
kelp cultivation removes carbon and nitrogen and helps mitigate ocean acidification in our local waters.
Maine
is
uniquely
positioned
to
grow
and
scale
the
seaweed
aquaculture
industry,
with
a
qualified
workforce
of
fishermen
who 
already
possess
the
key
infrastructure
and
working
knowledge
to
grow
high
quality
kelp
in
their
own
home
waters.
Over
the 
last
several
decades
the
Maine
aquaculture
sector
has
grown
slowly
and
steadily
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
Department
of 
Marine
Resources.
DMR’s
aquaculture
regulations
are
rigorous,
comprehensive,
and
some
of
the
best
in
the
world.
Their 
thoughtful
work
and
thorough
regulations
have
ensured
that
potentially
problematic
leases
and
bad
players
are
continually 
excluded
from
working
our
coastal
waters.
We
value
and
appreciate
the
work
DMR
has
done
to
ensure
strong
regulations
in 
Maine.
Atlantic
Sea
Farms
is
eager
to
build
our
partner
farmer
network,
but
LD
487
will
directly
impact
our
ability
to
provide
more 
opportunities
for
Maine’s
fishermen
to
continue
to
work
on
the
water.
This
bill
will
establish
regional
commissions
that
will 
duplicate
and
usurp
the
Department
of
Marine
Resources
management
of
state
waters
and
c
reate
new
and
additional
layers
of 
regulatory
bureaucracy
over
marine
waters
that
present
onerous
and
unneeded
steps
in
the
aquaculture
leasing
process
-
and 
would
significantly
stifle
opportunities
for
Maine’s
fishermen
to
diversify
their
incomes
in
the
face
of
increased
volatility
of 
their
fishery.
The
bill
will
create
a
patchwork
of
standards,
rules,
and
regulations
that
will
vary
along
the
coast
and
conflict
with 
state
and
federal
laws
and
regulations.
The
bill
will
allow
for
the
creation
of
additional
permits
and
fees
that
will
slow
-
if
not 
stop
-
economic
growth
within
the
state
and
put
new
farmers
at
a
competitive
disadvantage.
In
short,
it
will
unnecessarily
slow 
or
stop
an
already
lengthy
process
and
will
discourage
hard
working
fishermen
and
others
from
entering
into
aquaculture
at
a 
time when
we need to be thinking of ways to promote
economic development and diversification on our coast.
The
proposed
bill
is
born
out
of
insidious
fear
and
preys
on
our
feelings
of
uncertainty
in
the
face
of
change,
but
does 
not
represent
the
truth
of
how
our
waters
are
regulated
and
managed.
This
legislation
that
has
been
presented
as
a 
solution
for
Maine
and
the
environment
-
but
in
reality
is
a
way
for
wealthy
out-of-staters
to
have
a
clear
view
to
the 
ocean
at
the
detriment
of
hard
working
Maine
people
looking
to
create
thriving,
sustainable
businesses
on
the
ocean 
just as the lobster industry - which makes us who we are - is increasingly threatened.
I thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely, 
Liz MacDonald 
Seaweed Supply Director, Atlantic Sea Farms
