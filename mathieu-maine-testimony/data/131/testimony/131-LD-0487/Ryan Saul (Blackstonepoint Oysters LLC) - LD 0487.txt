LD 487
Hello my name is Ryan Saul of Phippsburg, I am currently an owner of a small scale 
oyster farm and manage another small farm in Damariscotta. I have lived in Maine for
10 years attending a state school and stayed in the state for aquaculture. This growing 
and profitable industry is good for Maine economically and environmentally. I am 
proud to work in an industry that continues Maine’s working waterfront heritage. 
Bill LD 487 creates restrictions in the lease process that will be detrimental to the 
aquaculture industry’s ability to grow, which in turn creates jobs and supports the 
environment of the state we love so much. When our farm started it took 2-3 years to 
get a lease and another year and half to break even, this means it will take another 
year to make a profit. This lengthy start to a business already stems from waiting on 
the process of acquiring a lease from the state as it is, adding another hoop to jump 
through will prevent growth to this industry. Aquaculture draws many young people 
to work in Maine, whether it be out of staters moving here or native Mainers staying 
for work in this promising growing industry. 
I oppose bill LD 487 because it will slow the growth of an industry that is good for 
the state, and will prevent us from continuing Mainers working waterfront heritage.
