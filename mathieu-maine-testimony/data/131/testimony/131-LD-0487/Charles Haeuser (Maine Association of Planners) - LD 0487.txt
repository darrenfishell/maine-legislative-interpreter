TESTIMONY OF THE MAINE ASSOCIATION OF PLANNERS  
TO THE JOINT STANDING  
COMMITTEE ON MARINE RESOURCES  
 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY PROVIDED NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST  LD # 487 
“An Act to Establish Coastal Waters and Submerged Lands Regional Planning 
Commissions ” 
 
DATE OF HEARING: Thursday, March 16, 2023 
 
Honorable Senator Cameron Reny , Honorable Representative Allison Hepler , 
Distinguished Members of the Committee on Marine Resources : 
 
 The Maine Association of Planners  (MAP)  is neither for nor against  LD #487.  
 
 While we are not sure why this bill has been brought forward, the desire for  increased regional 
considerations for such issues as coastal access, sea level rise, offshore wind infrastructure, and industrial 
aquaculture is understandable.  As such, MAP supports the general concept.  However, it is unclear why it 
would be necessary to create new  regional planning commissions  (RPCs)  when we already have existing , 
state law enabled  regional planning commissions that have  a long history of dealing with coastal issues , 
have an extensive network of regional relationships, have existing organizational infrastructure (offices, 
staff, etc.) , and so on.  If the problem is that the jurisdiction of existing RPCs  does not extend into coastal 
waters, our recommendation would be re -aim the legislation in that direction.   At the same time,  we think 
it would be a good idea  to provide the existing RPCs with more resources to ensure that they have the 
technical capabili ty to successfully facilitate solutions for submerged lands and coastal waters issues.  
 
 In summary, the Maine Association of Planners supports the concept of regional planning for 
issues related to submerged lands and coastal waters, but we feel  the existing RPCs should be enabled and 
empowered to do this without diluting regional planning in Maine by creating a parallel regional planning 
infrastructure.  
 
 We appreciate your time and attention to this legislation.  
 
Sincerely,
