LD 487
Like many in the aquaculture industry, I am keenly aware of the history behind and 
the inception of LD 487. I am here today to express my concern for the negative 
impact the bill could have existing state agencies, the aquaculture community, and ill 
prepared municipalities. I believe that LD 487 will create disparate layers to a process
that provides for considerable public discourse and if passed, would be in the interest 
of the few and not the many. To my humble way of approaching problem solving, I 
believe that cooperation, mediation, and compromise are considerably more favorable
ways of resolution than is short sighted legislation. While many, me included, may 
agree that the DMR and its leasing process isn’t perfect, as president of the 
Georgetown Island Oyster Cooperative, a member of the Georgetown Shellfish 
Committee and former Chair of the Georgetown Comprehensive Plan Marine 
Resources Committee, I believe that LD 487 is bad for Maine, bad for our marine 
economy and bad for every coastal municipality. I encourage each of you on the State
Marine Resources Committee to reject LD 487 and seek less divisive and more 
productive solutions to Maine’s aquaculture leasing program and how the state 
manages its submerged lands.
