Senator Reny , Representative Hepler , Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Marine Resources:  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon. My name is Shey 
Conover. My family and I live on Islesboro, and I am the co -owner of Islesboro Marine 
Enterprises, a full -service boatyard and sea farm growing Marshall Cove Mussels in the 
waters of Penobscot Bay.  
 
I am here  today to testify in opposition to LD 487, “An Act to Establish Coastal Waters 
and Submerged Lands Regional Planning Commissions .”  
 
Our farm recently completed a two -year process for approval of a 6 -acre standard lease 
site. Through this process, we had the opportunity for discussion and comments from 
local property owners, town harbormaster, several state agencies, and  members of the 
public from across the bay. The commissions established with LD 487 would duplicate or 
usurp authority from existing state regulatory agencies. The bill will allow the creation of 
additional permits and fees that will significantly increase  the cost of doing business , put 
Maine sea farmers at a competitive disadvantage , and complicate what is already a very 
lengthy and thorough permitting process.  
 
I also serve as the vice -chair of Islesboro’s Selectboard. From my experience as an 
elected mu nicipal official, I am very concerned about the burden the establishment of 
these commissions will have on our towns, giving municipalities management 
responsibilities over state waters that we do not have the time, resources, or expertise to 
implement . 
 
For these reasons, please vote Ought NOT to Pass on LD 487. Thank you for your 
consideration. I would be glad to answer any questions you may have. ￼    
  
 
Sincerely,  
 
Shey Conover
