LD 487
Dear Marine Resources Committee,
I am writing to express my opposition to LD 487 for a number of reasons related to my 
business operations as a shellfish farmer. While I support local and regional involvement in 
coastal uses such as aquaculture development and planning efforts, my type of business 
(shellfish aquaculture in shallow water) already requires permission and permitting at multiple 
local, state, and federal levels. There is an existing process for the public and members with 
regional interests to participate in the aquaculture leasing process, thus it seems duplicitous 
to add complexity to an overburdened and onerous regulatory process. For example, I 
already have to obtain permission from the town harbormaster, town shellfish committee, and 
board of selectmen for  intertidal and shallow water lease applications, in addition to the 
Maine DMR (oftentimes in consultation with DEP and IF&W), as well as US Army Corps of 
Engineers and Coast Guard PATON. I do not support the creation of additional regulatory and
planning entities at this point in time, in this manner. Thank you for your time and please note 
my opposition to LD487.
