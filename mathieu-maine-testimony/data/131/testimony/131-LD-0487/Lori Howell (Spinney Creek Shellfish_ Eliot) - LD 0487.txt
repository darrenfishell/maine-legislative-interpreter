Testimony in Opposition to: LD 487 An Act to Establish Coastal Waters and Submerged Lands 
Regional Planning Commissions
To the Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources,
October of this year will mark our 40th year in business.  We are a reliable, well-paying, small 
business in the furthest southern region of this state.  We have 12 people working year â€˜round and 
add an additional 6-8 staff for the summer months.
I am here today to testify in opposition to LD 487.  This bill would establish Regional Planning 
Commissions with authorities, and essentially veto power, over coastal and submerged lands.  
Numerous agencies already have this authority and are routinely included in decisions regarding 
these areas.  Extending municipal authority to state-owned waters will conflict with other laws and 
rules.
It is hard enough already to do business in Maine, especially in the public spaces, without this 
proposed additional layer of permitting and fees and business uncertainty that would result. 
Please do not further burden this industry.
On Monday of this week, we sent two of our staff members to the Boston Seafood Show.  They 
came back both energized and depressed.  They were energized to see what a larger universe we 
work in. They were depressed because they learned through their many conversations that Maine 
is losing its edge and that other states are creating more favorable regulatory environments for 
shellfish businesses and farmers.  With so many opportunities in other states we fear losing 
trained and valuable employees to greater opportunities outside Maine.  
Please vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 487.
Sincerely,
Lori A. HowellLori A. Howell, M.S., J.D.
