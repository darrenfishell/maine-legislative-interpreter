LD 487
I would like to testify in favor of LD 487. As a Retired Marine Patrol with over 33 
years of service with approximately 28 years patrolling Frenchman Bay and the 
adjoining waters. I think that it is very important to be proactive in managing our 
resources, not to be reactive as many things in this State are on the verge of decline, if
not already almost nonexistent. I think that Municipalities should have the right to 
manage the waters inside their Town Boundaries. I believe that this bill would allow 
Municipalities the ability to work together to formulate a plan to manage the Bay that 
they all share, open channels of clear and constructive communication with State 
Agencies to protect our Bays.
