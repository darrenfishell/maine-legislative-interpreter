Chair
Reny ,
Chair
Hepler ,
and
Members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Marine
Resources.
My
name
is
Kathryn
Gaianguest.
I
live
in
Lamoine,
a
maritime
community
at
the
head
of
Frenchman
Bay .
I
am
speaking
today
in
support
of
LD
487
.
I
am
a
retired
Sociologist.
I
have
served
for
5
years
on
the
Lamoine
Comprehensive
Planning
Committee.
The
binding
themes
in
my
career
of
teaching
and
applied
practice
have
been
two:
1)
managing
conflicts
between
diverse
public
and
private
interests,
and
2)
developing
ways
in
which
public
and
private
organizations
and
communities
can
foster
a
balance
between
development
and
the
environment.
LD
487
is
a
bill
about
planning.
It
is
about
engaging
citizens,
their
municipalities
and
all
sea
harvesters
in
joint
decision-making
at
the
local
level.
It
is
about
changing
decision-making
af fecting
critical
aspects
of
citizens’
lives
from
the
current,
centralized,
State
bureaucracy
into
an
organized
and
shared
local
responsibility .
This
bill
recommends
a
new ,
fairer
and
more
equitable
approach
to
a
growing
problem
facing
all
communities
along
Maine’ s
coastal
waters:
How
can
these
communities
exercise
their
rights
of
home
rule?
How
can
they
use
their
knowledge
and
experiences
to
have
local
control
over
the
future
of
their
coastal
waters,
one
of
their
most
valuable
resources?
LD
487
is
about
supplementing
and
complementing
the
various
roles
and
responsibilities
of
State
government.
Currently ,
four
State
departments
engage
in
various
aspects
of
managing
the
waters
and
submerged
lands
of
Maine’ s
bays.
Y es,
4
departments--Marine
Resources,
Agriculture
Conservation
and
Forestry ,
Environmental
Protection,
and
T ransportation.
At
times
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
is
also
involved.
None
of
these
departments
engage
in
planning
for
the
coastal
waters
and
submerged
lands…
they
regulate,
monitor ,
and
administer .
Their
oft-stated
functions
emphasize
their
sole
rights
to
managing
the
coastal
waters.
(E.g.,
see
attached
letter
from
the
Deputy
Commissioner
of
Marine
Resources.)
Regional
planning
organizations
do
exist
to
serve
inland
and
coastal
Maine
municipalities.
However ,
their
planning
ends
at
the
1
shoreline.
Additionally ,
department
reviews
of
permit
applications
do
not
provide
effective
avenues
for
broad
local
input
into
decisions
af fecting
all
communities
surrounding
a
bay .
I
emphasize
“effective”
because
we
can
all
speak
at
public
hearings,
but
only
the
town
directly
impacted
by
a
proposed
development
has
a
voice
in
the
decision
making,
and
then
the
final
say
still
is
decided
by
the
state
department.
A
possible
opportunity
in
Maine
for
comprehensive
of f-shore
planning
lies
in
the
Maine
Coastal
Program,
a
NOAA
program
located
in
the
Department
of
Marine
Resources.
The
range
of
possible
goals
for
this
small
program
far
exceeds
its
staf fing
and
financial
resources.
Its
goals
for
the
2021-25
funding
period
include
focused
attention
on
aquaculture
and
wind
farm
development.
It
will
not
address
more
coordinated
local
assessments
and
planning
for
managing
the
varied
needs
and
pressures
on
coastal
Maine
waters.
Right
now ,
development
in
Maine’ s
coastal
waters
is
dominated
by
the
most
and
best
organized.
Some
have
likened
the
farming
in
our
bays
to
homesteading--the
most
organized
and
the
most
aggressive
take
over
the
waters.
There
also
is
a
popularizing
of
the
need
to
grow
our
aquatic
food
because
wild
stocks
are
diminishing.
Increased
dominance
of
aquaculture
or
any
other
single
focus
to
the
exclusion
of
other
bay
users--lobstermen,
clam
and
muscle
diggers,
boaters,
sea
vegetable
harvesters,
sailers,
tourist
excursions…will
only
lead
to
intensified
conflicts
and
disenfranchisement.
Some
argue
that
LD
487
is
simply
about
protecting
“pristine
waters”
for
rich
(part-time)
shore
owners.
Adherents
to
this
oversimplification
of
a
serious
problem
need
to
address
even
one
small
aspect:
what
do
large,
close-shore
aquaculture
settlements
in
bays
do
to
one
of
Maine’ s
greatest
assets--shore
tourism:
nation-wide
and
world-wide
visitors
coming
to
Maine
to
experience
the
serenity
of
our
ocean
shores,
the
viewscapes,
and
the
natural
seafood
locally
harvested.
However ,
LD
487
is
not
about
only
one
aspect
of
bay
development.
It
is
about
planning
to
make
developments
in
Maine’ s
bays
compatible
to
include
all
uses
and
interests
of
the
bay ,
be
they
recreation,
tourist
excursions,
viewscapes,
aquaculture
of
all
sizes,
all
fisheries,
wind
turbines…
And
it
is
about
looking
forward
to
conservation
and
preservation
of
our
coastal
waters
for
future
generations.
This
proposal
is
not
perfect….it
is
human…and
Lord
knows
humans
are
not
perfect!
It
is
a
six
year
ef fort
bringing
together
the
interests
of
varied
groups
along
our
shores.
Noteworthy
is
that
two
other
organizations
have
recently
proposed
more
local
input
and
local
control
of
marine
decisions.
(See:
Maine
Aquaculture
Roadmap
(2022):
Goal
4,
Item
2
:
”Explore
Aquaculture
development
zones
with
help
of
municipalities,
2
establishing
areas
pre-vetted
through
a
local
planning
process
that
accounts
for
regional
nuances.”

Control
.)
The
approach
proposed
in
LD
487
is
not
new:
it
follows
planning
models
of
the
Shoreland
Zoning
Act,
Saco
River
Planning
Commission,
and
Frenchman
Bay
and
other
regional
Shellfish
Conservation
organizations.
All
these
are
legislatively
established,
municipally
supported,
locally-controlled
organizations
managing
their
respective
areas.
This
is
a
comprehensive,
therefore
complex,
bill
that
invites
many
questions
about
its
details
and
implementation.
Our
approaches
to
the
involved
departments
and
the
Maine
Coastal
Program
unfortunately
have
been
met
with
refusals
to
meet,
except
for
an
in
depth
and
helpful
meeting
with
the
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
Department.
W e
hope
that
we
will
have
the
opportunity
to
more
fully
explain
and
answer
your
questions
about
this
bill.
Individuals
from
many
walks
of
life
have
come
together
to
seek
an
equitable,
fair
and
local/regional
solution
to
the
growing
problems
experienced
in
our
W aters.
Developments
in
Maine’ s
of fshore
waters
are
on
the
verge
of
getting
out
of
control.
Planning
for
Maine’ s
bays
and
coastal
waters
cannot
wait.
Please
vote
ought-to-pass
on
LD
487.

Dear Ms. Wilkinson, 
I am writing to notify the town of Gouldsboro and its Board of Selectmen that the Maine 
Department of Maine  Resources (DMR) objects to the proposed ordinance regarding the 
regulation of aquaculture currently being considered by  the town.  
The Commissioner of Marine Resources holds exclusive jurisdiction to lease lands in, on and 
under the coastal  waters, including the public lands beneath those waters and portions of the
intertidal zone, for scientific research or for  aquaculture of marine organisms (12 M.R.S.A. 
§6072 (1)). Municipalities have limited jurisdiction in the intertidal zone  if they have an 
approved municipal shellfish ordinance (in accordance with 12 M.R.S.A. §6671), and may be 
authorized  to issue municipal aquaculture permits (in accordance with 12 M.R.S.A. §6673), 
but this does not limit in any way the  Commissioner’s authority to issue leases and licenses 
in the coastal waters of the State.  
As a courtesy, DMR wishes to inform the town of its position that many elements of this 
proposed ordinance, and  specifically those which create an aquaculture licensing program 
for the purpose of regulating the activity of aquaculture  in marine waters, are pre-empted by 
State law. 
As the state agency managing and regulating aquaculture, DMR acknowledges that there 
have been significant  concerns about the scale of recent proposals in the area, and would be
open to beginning a dialogue with the town  regarding our existing application and evaluation 
process for marine aquaculture leases and licenses. We believe our  existing process is 
robust and provides adequate opportunity for municipal engagement, as well as public 
participation, to  ensure appropriate protection of existing uses.  
Sincerely, 
Meredith Mendelson 
Deputy Commissioner
