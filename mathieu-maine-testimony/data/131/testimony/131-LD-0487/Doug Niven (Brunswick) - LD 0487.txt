I oppose this Bill.
  The bill allows the establishment of commissions that would usurp and/or duplicate authority
that at least three state regulatory agencies already have.
  I support MAA and their efforts to find constructive solutions that address public concerns 
while allowing Maine aquaculture businesses to grow.
  The bill is vague and contains no definition of “large bays” or “other coastal regions” to which
it applies.
  The bill would create a checkerboard of standards, rules, and regulations that vary along the
coast, pit municipalities against each other, and establish gated communities in public waters.
  The bill will create commissions that may establish rules and regulations which conflict with 
existing state and federal laws and regulations.
  The bill will allow the creation of additional permits and fees that will significantly increase 
the cost of doing business and put Maine sea farmers at a competitive disadvantage.
  The bill will give municipalities management responsibilities over state waters that they do 
not have the resources or expertise to implement.
  Section 2 of the bill constitutes an unfunded mandate to municipalities.
  The bill will significantly increase municipalities legal exposure in areas that they have no 
experience or knowledge in.
