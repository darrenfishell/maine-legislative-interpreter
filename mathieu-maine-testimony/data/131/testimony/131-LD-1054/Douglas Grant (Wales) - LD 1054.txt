LD 1054
Written testimony in support of LD1054
Thank you members of the committee for reading my opinion.  My name is Douglas 
Grant of Wales.  My Father, as well as many of my friends and family have served in 
the National Guard.  It is my opinion that we should be grateful for those who are 
willing to serve.  Defense of our State should be the most important job of our State. 
It seems that our State's defensive Guardsmen are being deployed to combat zones all 
over the world.  With the stroke of a pen in Washington our brave young men and 
women get to fight in a conflict that in no way threatens the people of the State of 
Maine. It is my understanding that these overseas deployments violate the intent of 
the National Guard.  I strongly believe that our state needs defense, but not from the 
people our sons and daughters are sent to kill, or be killed by.
As far as I can see, this law simply requires that the constitution is followed.  
Personally, Iâ€™m tired of the constitution being ignored.  If our guardsmen are needed 
for foreign wars, they could still go and help.  Congress would simply have to make 
an official declaration.  If we have a natural disaster, or any major emergency, I 
would feel better having our Guardsmen on our soil.  This bill meets my requirements
to pass.  I say pass any law that limits the size or scope of Government.  Please vote to
pass LD 1054.
Respectfully submitted,
Douglas Grant
Wales, Maine
