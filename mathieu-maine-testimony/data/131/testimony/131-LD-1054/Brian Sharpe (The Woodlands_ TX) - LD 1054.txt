LD 1054
I am a West Point graduate, and a former officer in both the Regular Army and the National 
Guard.  I support LD 1054.
 
Both my brothers were also in the military.  My father and both his brothers were in the 
military.  I had three great uncles serve in World War Two.  We support the troops.
LD 1054 is just following the rules.  If Congress declares war, send the Guard.  If 
Congress doesn't declare war, don't.  It's simple.  And it's consistent with the oath of 
enlistment each of us took to "support and defend the Constitution," which vest in 
Congress alone the power to declare war.
Thank you for considering this bill.  Brian Sharpe
