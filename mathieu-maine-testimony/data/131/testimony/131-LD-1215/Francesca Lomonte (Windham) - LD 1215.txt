Francesca Lomonte
Windham
LD 1215
Hello Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. My name is Francesca Lomonte 
and I am a sophomore at Windham High School in Windham. I would like to testify 
in favor of LD 1215, An Act To End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products. 
I would like to be able to use the bathroom during the 7+ hours a day I spend at 
school. Problems in my school, including students vaping in the bathrooms, have 
caused a much stricter bathroom protocol to be put in place. This includes closing off 
bathrooms and making staff members have to sit outside the bathrooms in an attempt 
to supervise without impeding on students’ privacy. I would like to be able to use the 
restroom in my school without smelling Mango Tango or Tutti Fruity. Ending the sale
of flavored tobacco products would help to keep tobacco companies from targeting 
me and trying to hook me and my friends on these dangerous products. I would like to
be able to have a future for myself and my peers that isn’t riddled with the diseases 
these products cause. 
I am still a kid. I don’t get a vote or a say in who gets elected to represent me, but I 
sincerely ask you to make the right decision and stand by me and my future. Thank 
you for your time.
