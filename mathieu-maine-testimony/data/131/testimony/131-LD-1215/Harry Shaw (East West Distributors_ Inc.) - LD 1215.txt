                We are writing in today in reference to the meeting for the state wide 
flavor ban.  
East West Distributors is a New Hampshire based company that also 
services the state of Maine.  
We saw firsthand  the effects of the Massachusetts flavor ban. When the 
ban took effect, we noticed immediately a significant increase in sales of flavored 
tobacco to our New Hampshire customers that border Massachusetts. By 
implementing a Maine statewide flavor ban you would be reducing the tax revenue that would be collected, and New Hampshire would be benefiting from 
this.  Much like Massachusetts, it is likely that several “Mom and Pop” stores 
would be forced to close and possibly reopen across the state border, due to lost sales.  
It would be prudent to wait until the FDA makes a final decision as to how 
they plan on handling the flavor tobacco sales in the United States. The FDA has said it plans to announced these guidelines in the fall of 2023.  Removing the 
need for each individual state to take their own action. By waiting for the FDA 
guidelines, The State of Maine will continue to collect the tax revenue that the 
good people of Maine could use.  
 Thank you for your time.
