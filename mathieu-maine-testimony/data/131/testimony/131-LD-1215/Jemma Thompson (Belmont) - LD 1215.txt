Vaping has helped me as well as so many others quit smoking cigarettes. I know that 
you are not banning vaping, just the flavors, but the flavors are the heart and soul of 
the vape juice industry, what's the point of vaping if I cant vape something that I like?
I cant even think about going back to a cigarette the smell alone is sickening, not 
everyone who is a smoker likes the taste of plain tobacco if you pass this bill the 
amount of revenue lost from customers will be substantial, we will not simply switch 
back to smoking cigarettes that's how much these products have helped us make 
better choices.
