Dear members of the committee, I'm a tobacco retailer in the State and oppose this 
legislation. I saw what happened in Massachusetts when they banned flavored 
tobacco product and it doesn't seem to be working out well for them. They have 
pushed many sales to the black market and to neighboring States. Adults should have 
the ability to make there own choices. The adults that are seen in my store are finding 
a relief from a life long habit of smoking combustible cigarettes. Many have 
expressed they fear cigarettes being there only option and don't want to go back to 
combustibles but feel they would if tobacco vapes were the only thing available. I 
urge you to oppose this legislation and appreciate your consideration
