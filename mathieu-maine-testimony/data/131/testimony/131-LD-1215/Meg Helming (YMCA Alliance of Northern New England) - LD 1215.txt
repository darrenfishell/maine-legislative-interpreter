Testimony of Meg Helming 
before the Committee On Health and Human Services 
 in support of  
LD 1215: An Act To End The Sale Of Flavored Tobacco Products 
   
April 25, 2023 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Committee 
On Health and Human Services, my name is Meg Helming and I’m the COO for the 
YMCA Alliance of Northern New England, which represents the 15 YMCAs in Maine. The 
YMCA strongly supports LD 1215: An Act To End The Sale Of Flavored Tobacco 
Products. 
 
The YMCA is a community leader in supporting children, adults and families in their 
lifelong quest for physical, emotional and social wellness. As one of the largest youth-
serving organizations in the state that has been in operation for more than 150 years, 
we are particularly concerned about the sharp increase in Maine youth’s use of 
tobacco products in recent years. The evidence shows that the vast majority of youth 
who have used tobacco started with a flavored product. According to the US Surgeon 
General, nicotine exposure during adolescence and young adulthood can cause 
addiction and harm the developing brain. We feel strongly that ending the sale of 
flavored tobacco products in Maine is a critical step in protecting the health and 
wellbeing of our community’s youth. 
 
At the Y, we believe that all kids deserve the opportunity to thrive. The Maine YMCAs 
stand in partnership with other health and youth-serving organizations across the 
state in support of strong public health policies that protect Maine youth. 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
 
Meg Helming
