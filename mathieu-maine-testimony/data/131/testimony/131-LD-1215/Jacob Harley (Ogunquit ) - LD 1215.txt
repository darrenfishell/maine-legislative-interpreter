Saw this was happening after being pointed out by a local business, I smoke hookah 
on a weekly basis, it is my relaxation method of choice, some people drink beer or 
smoke cigs, I like Shisha. I don't want that to be affected because of a flavor ban on 
tobacco products, I am an adult and have the right to choose what I like to consume 
and that just happens to be fruit flavored tobacco, have been doing so for years and I 
don't think its fair to suddenly have a change of heart because the products are making
their way into the schools, take some of that tax money you make from tobacco in 
general and invest it into better regulations at the schools.
