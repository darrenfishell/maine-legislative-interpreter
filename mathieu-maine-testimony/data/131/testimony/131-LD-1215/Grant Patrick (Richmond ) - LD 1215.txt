I find it highly suspicious of everyone involved with this to be pushing to end 
flavored vapes when, the tobacco industy kills hundreds of thousands yearly. Some 
that have never smoked.
I want to know how anyone involved with this sleep at night. How are you going to 
push me back to cigarettes, and pipe tobacco? Who is paying you to take this stance 
and are you prepared to deal with the karma of thinking you can choose what's best 
for me? Any government representative who would force me to choose one poison for
another cannot possibly represent a public they have been elected to serve.
