Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
My
name
is
Laura
Ar gitis
and
I
am
the
co-owner
of
North
43
Bistro
in
South
Portland
and
a
partner
of
T obacco-Free
Maine
W orks.
I
support
LD
1215
because
it’ s
an
opportunity
to
meaningfully
curb
youth
tobacco
use
and
stave
of f
tobacco’ s
negative
consequences
for
families,
communities,
and
businesses
across
the
state.
T obacco
use
is
a
leading
cause
of
preventable
death
and
disease
in
Maine.
Most
people
who
use
tobacco
start
at
or
before
they
turn
18
years
old,
and
flavored
products
attract
and
hook
kids.
A
recent
survey
also
shows
that
more
than
eight
in
ten
current
youth
e-cigarette
users
vape
flavored
products,
with
fruit,
candy
and
dessert
flavored
products
as
some
of
the
most
popular
[2].
And
according
to
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
,
“youth
smokers
are
more
likely
to
use
menthol
cigarettes
than
any
other
age
group”
[3].
T obacco
addiction
damages
peoples’
health
and
well-being,
and
it’ s
an
unnecessary
strain
on
employers
who
already
struggle
to
find
reliable
staf f.
Every
year ,
smoking
costs
Maine
nearly
$1.5
billion
due
to
associated
health
care
expenses
and
lost
productivity .
As
a
restaurant
owner ,
I
see
firsthand
how
challenging
it
is
to
find
and
keep
staf f.
T obacco
users
tend
to
get
sick
more
often,
which
can
exacerbate
staf fing
issues.
That
is
the
business
owner's
perspective.
However ,
I’m
not
just
a
business
owner .
I
have
a
family ,
friends
and
a
community
to
look
out
for .
That’ s
why
I
think
it’ s
important
to
take
cues
from
health
experts
like
T ara
Morin,
a
doctor
and
family
friend
who
communicated
to
us
the
serious
nature
of
flavored
tobacco
use
among
youths.
Her
expertise
and
knowledge
on
the
issue
resonated
with
our
beliefs,
and
ultimately
brought
our
restaurant
on
board.
Ending
the
sale
of
flavored
tobacco
products
will
help
promote
healthy
communities
where
businesses
can
succeed.
