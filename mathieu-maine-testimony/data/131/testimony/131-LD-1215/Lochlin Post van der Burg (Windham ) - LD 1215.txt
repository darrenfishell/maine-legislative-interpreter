As a student and a resident of Maine. I would like to see my generation and 
community flourish without the stain of flavored nicotine products in our schools and 
stores. If this bill does not get signed into law, my generation will be condemned to 
high cancer and drug overdose rates. It has been proven with cigarettes decades ago, 
and we should be prepared to save one of the most innovative and important 
generations in our society.
