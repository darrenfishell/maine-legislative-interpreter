Dear Committee Members,
I manage a business that sells tobacco products, and I'm alarmed by Maine's proposal 
to ban flavored tobacco products. This reckless policy would decimate this business 
and imperil Maine's tax revenue. 
When you were elected, I thought you would work to advance our state. I'm 
beginning to learn that the Maine State Legislature would rather generate tax revenue 
for states like New Hampshire. You may think this statement is bold, but the demand 
does not disappear if you ban flavored tobacco products. Instead, it transfers to other 
states, which is precisely what happened in Massachusetts. This would be especially 
devastating to our stateâ€™s economy considering how much we depend on our 
neighbors shopping in Maine. Implementing this policy would cut off an outsized 
source of tax revenue, as well as customers who come to Maine to support our small 
businesses.
Now is the time to support our small businesses, not implement mandates that would 
cripple our state's already fragile economic well-being. I urge you to reconsider this 
proposal that would willingly forfeit our state's tax revenue to our neighbors. Thank 
you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
