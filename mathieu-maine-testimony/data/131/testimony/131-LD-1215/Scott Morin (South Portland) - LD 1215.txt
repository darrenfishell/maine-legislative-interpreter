LD 1215
Dear committee members,
I wish to testify in support of proposed bill LD1215 and the end of sale of flavored 
tobacco products.  I am a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician in southern 
Maine.  I see every day the devastating effects of nicotine addiction.  I am particularly
disturbed about the sale of flavored tobacco products that end up in the hands of 
adolescents and young users.  Candy flavored nicotine is solely meant to create a new 
generation of nicotine addicts.  We know that nicotine addiction created by smokeless
tobacco products increases the risk of cigarette smoking (still the number one risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer).  Maine continues to have one of the 
highest smoking rates in the country.  Please don't be swayed by the argument that 
e-cigarettes or vaping can be an effective tool to quit smoking.  This is a debatable 
contention given the extremely high nicotine levels sold in vaping cartridges (they are
more likely to foster an addiction rather than treat it).   Regardless flavorless 
electronic cigarettes would suffice if used to truly treat nicotine addiction.  
Sincerely,
Scott Morin, DO
