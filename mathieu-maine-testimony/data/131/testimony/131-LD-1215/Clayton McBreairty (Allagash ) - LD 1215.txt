LD 1215
My name is Clayton McBreairty and I am a resident of Allagash. I would like to 
express my support for LD 1215 and ending the sale of flavored tobacco products in 
the state of Maine. As someone who started smoking menthol cigarettes at the age of 
17 and struggled with a dependency on them for over 30 years, I am in full support of 
legislation to ban flavored tobacco products in Maine. Flavored tobacco products like 
menthol cigarettes target youth and vulnerable communities to get them hooked on 
nicotine. If thoughtful people had made good decisions in the Legislature when I was 
a youth, I may not have had the access to tobacco that I did have. 
Smoking took a toll on my health. I smoked heavily for years, and tried several times 
to quit. It was not until my late 40s that a period of ill health led me to finally quit. 
Even so, I was diagnosed with emphysema directly related to my cigarette smoking a 
few years later. 
Quitting smoking was one of the most challenging things I've ever done, it is an 
unbelievably strong addiction. That's why I believe banning flavored tobacco 
products is a crucial step for future generations. These flavored products exist only to 
lure kids in, like they did for me. 
It's time to take action and protect our communities, especially our youth, from the 
harmful effects of tobacco.
Please do what is right for your constituents, and more importantly what is right for 
kids and pass this bill. LD 1215 will protect generations of children. It is a clear 
choice between them or the Big Tobacco industry. 
Thank you,
Clayton McBreairty, Allagash
