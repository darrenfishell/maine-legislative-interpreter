Honorable Committee members:
Thank you for your consideration of the many dangers of flavored tobacco .   As a 
lifelong pediatrician, I have seen the dangerous rise in use of these products, which 
are cleverly designed to look and taste candy-like.  It is well established that a vast 
number of young smokers start with flavored products, and tobacco use in youth is 
very likely to lead to addiction.  Young people are often impulsive with poor 
assessment of risk and outcome, especially when there is social pressure to join a 
crowd.   Letâ€™s help protect them by making these products unavailable.  Their future 
health as well as the health of our communities and environment depend on this.
