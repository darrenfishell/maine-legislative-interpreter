LD 1215
As someone who began smoking as a teenager, I have seen firsthand the pathway that 
children have to accessing tobacco products. I began smoking at the age of 15 through
friends, but in time was able to have them regularly and become a smoker when 
several adults would purchase them for me. I was lucky enough to quit smoking in my
20s when I became a mother, before my tobacco use became a significant drain upon 
my life. However, not everyone is so fortunate. That is why I believe the Legislature 
must act and pass LD 1215
That is why I strongly support legislation to ban flavored tobacco products in Maine. 
These products are often marketed towards youth and can make tobacco use seem 
appealing and harmless. But the reality is that tobacco use is a major public health 
crisis that leads to addiction, disease, and death.
Flavored tobacco products are especially insidious because they can mask the harsh 
taste of tobacco and make it easier for individuals to start smoking. In fact, recent data
shows that an overwhelming majority of youth who had used tobacco products in the 
past 30 days reported using a flavored product during that time.
By banning flavored tobacco products, we can help protect Maineâ€™s youth from the 
dangers of tobacco use. We can prevent a new generation from becoming addicted to 
nicotine and suffering the devastating health consequences that come with it.
As a social worker, I have seen how addiction can tear families apart and ruin lives. 
But I have also seen the power of prevention and early intervention in helping 
individuals overcome addiction and live healthy, fulfilling lives. Banning flavored 
tobacco products is an important step towards preventing addiction and promoting 
public health in Maine.
