Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
My
name
is
Mike
Friedland,
I
own
the
Lumbery
in
Cape
Elizabeth,
and
I’m
a
partner
of
T obacco-Free
Maine
W orks.
I’m
writing
in
favor
of
LD
1215,
an
Act
to
End
the
Sale
of
Flavored
T obacco
Products.
As
a
business
owner ,
I’m
not
quick
to
impose
government
regulations
on
other
businesses.
However ,
when
it
comes
to
selling
flavored
tobacco
products
that
can
attract
and
hook
kids,
that’ s
a
dif ferent
story .
At
the
Lumbery ,
we
pride
ourselves
on
sourcing
sustainable
and
locally
sourced
wood,
and
in
doing
so
we
nurture
our
environment
and
support
local
communities
across
Maine.
T obacco
addiction,
with
all
the
health
harms
that
come
with
it,
degrades
our
communities.
Ending
the
sale
of
flavored
tobacco
products
will
help
ensure
young
people
don’t
get
ensnared
into
a
lifetime
of
addiction.
I
urge
you
to
vote
ought
to
pass
on
LD
1215.
Sincerely ,
Mike
Friedland,
The
Lumbery
