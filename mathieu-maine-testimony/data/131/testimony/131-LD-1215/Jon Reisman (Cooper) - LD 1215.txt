Testimony in Opposition to LD 1174, An Act to Prohibit the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products and LD 
1215, An Act to End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products. 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, honorable members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee: 
Thank you for accepting this testimony in opposition to LD 1174, An Act to Prohibit the Sale of 
Flavored Tobacco Products and LD 1215, An Act to End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products. My 
name is Jon Reisman. I have recently retired from the University of Maine at Machias after 38 
years of teaching and service as a professor of economics and public policy. I am a Selectman 
for the Town of Cooper, a columnist (Freedom Studies) for two Washington County weeklies 
and a Statler and Waldorf intern. 
My opposition to these attempts to end the sale of flavored tobacco products is that they are 
counterproductive in terms of harm reduction and inconsistent with policies that treat Maine 
citizens, whether adults or minors, as capable of making health decisions for themselves. 
They are counterproductive in that they will remove a means of smoking cessation from the 
market. 
They are inconsistent in that Maine and the United States have many policies that                                            
allow adults and sometimes minors to make their own decisions without government 
prohibitions, including reproductive and gender affirming health care and dietary choices. 
Advocates for the nanny state may indeed believe that they know best. In my experience, the 
nanny is not so much Mary Poppins as Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest, 
and I would prefer that the state not mandate lobotomies in order to obtain desired obeisant 
behavior. 
I would be glad to answer any questions at jreisman@maine.edu
