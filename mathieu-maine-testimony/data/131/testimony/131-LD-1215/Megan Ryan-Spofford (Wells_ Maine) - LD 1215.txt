20+ years ago, Phillip Morris conducted a cost/benefit analysis in the Czech Republic to justify 
legality of cigarettes. They cited tobacco tax income and healthcare savings from smoking-
related shortened life spans as benefits in their study. Phillip Morris ultimately issued a formal 
apology for their cost/benefit analysis, however, to leverage the same Utilitarian ethics as they 
attempted, I am asking you consider the greatest reward for the greatest number.  
 
As of the 2020 census, there were 252,036 Mainers under the age of 18.  
In August of 2022, there were 1,838 tobacco resellers in Maine.  
 
By ending the sale of flavored tobacco products in Maine, we will save Maine’s youth from 
childhood and adolescent addiction, lower health care costs, yet boost productivity. This is the 
greatest reward for the greatest number.
