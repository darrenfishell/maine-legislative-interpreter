Dear Health and Human Services Committee Members,
These proposed flavor bans simply do not make sense.  Let's pretend for a minute we 
are trying to protect teenagers.  When is the flavored alcohol ban going to be 
proposed, and why is marijuana legal and so readily available for purchase?  This is 
the height of hypocrisy, and it isn't fooling anyone.  We all know this is just about 
getting rid of all tobacco products one by one.  Teenagers aren't dying to get their 
hands on a menthol cigarette or a can of wintergreen dip.  What they are doing is 
vaping all the fruity flavors actually targeted at teenagers.  Here in Scarborough, we 
have benefited from the Portland and South Portland bans.  So, we know how much 
business this state will lose to other states primarily New Hampshire if the state ban 
passes.  Please reconsider this whole issue.  There has to be a better way to protect our
children than banning all flavored tobacco products.  Maybe let's start with doing 
something about the THC gummy bears sold all over the state.
Truthfully,
