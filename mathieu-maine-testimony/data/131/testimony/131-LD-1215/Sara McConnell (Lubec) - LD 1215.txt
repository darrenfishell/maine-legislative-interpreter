LD 1215
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services: my name is Sara 
McConnell and I live in Lubec and flavors hooked me. I am here today to testify in 
favor of LD 1215, An Act To End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products.
Growing up in rural Maine my parents and grandparents all smoked. During middle 
school I decided to give it a try. My Mom had regular cigarettes, but I took a liking to 
my Dads menthols. I continued to smoke for over 16 years with numerous attempts to
quit. It wasn't until my Dad, at the age of 49, died of lung cancer that I finally broke 
free.  
Iâ€™ve lost my two grandmothers, a grandfather and many friends of the family to 
smoking related illnesses. I am so grateful that I no longer smoke. And I'm so proud 
of my Mom, who on her birthday June 1st, will be smoke free for 12 years! My 
brother still smokes, I really worry about him and I'm really concerned for my niece 
and nephew who are being bombarded with all of the new tobacco devices and 
flavors. Flavors hook Maine kids - lets put an end to flavored tobacco!
