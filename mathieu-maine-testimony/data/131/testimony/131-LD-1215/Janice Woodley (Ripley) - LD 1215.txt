I work for a vape shop and my job as well as countless others will be affected by this, 
let alone our loyal customers who are so proud to have made the choice to stop 
smoking more harmful tobacco products and choose less harmful products to try to 
better themselves or just save couple bucks, please don't pass this bill our local 
community will be affected by this negatively
