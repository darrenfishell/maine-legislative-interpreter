I grew up in a house of full of smokers. I constantly smelled like smoke, and had to 
deal with any number of other inconveniences because of the cigarette smoke. Things 
like not being able to breathe, the unbearable smell, and of course the thoughts of my 
family's well being, and my own because of the well documented health risks that 
come along with smoking. When I became an adult, I found myself having issues 
coping with stress, and turned to vaping. It appealed to me not only because of the 
flavors, but because of the many studies done around the world showing it to be less 
of a health risk than cigarettes. While I acknowledge any time someone inhales 
something other than the air we breathe into their lungs it is considered unhealthy, 
there is no denying scientific studies that show this to be a much better option. We as 
a people have a right to intake tobacco products how we see fit. I understand that 
there are concerns about flavors being more appealing to minors, however there are 
already laws in place to protect from this happening, and banning flavors is not going 
to stop minors from trying to rebel against authority. It is much safer for these 
flavored products to stay legal, it will prevent people from making their own flavored 
juices who have no experience doing it themselves and potentially causing damage to 
themselves or others. Not to mention the jobs and income you will destroy by voting 
to put this bill into law. Maine will lose considerable funds in taxes, and many small 
businesses will suffer. It is time to stop making a boogyman out of flavored tobacco 
products and acknowledge the real issues. Thank you.
