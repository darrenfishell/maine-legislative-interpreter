I'm writing to oppose the flavored tobacco bans being proposed. I find vaping has 
made me a healthier person. I should be able to purchase these products as an adult. If
you are going to allow Marijuanna and alcohol to be sold then tobacco shouldn't be 
any different. Just find a way to regulate and keep out of the hands of youth. Please 
oppose this legislation.
