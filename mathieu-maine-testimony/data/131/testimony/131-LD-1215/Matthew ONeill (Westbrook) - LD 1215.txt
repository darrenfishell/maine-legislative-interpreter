I oppose banning the sale of flavored tobacco products. I myself used vaping, a 
proven safer alternative, to quit using chewing tobacco which I used for many years. I
do not believe that an adults right to purchase certain products should be taken away 
from them, I don’t feel it’s right. It’s would greatly affect myself, an employee of a 
store that sells these products, as well as thousands of adults looking for a safer 
alternative to smoking.
