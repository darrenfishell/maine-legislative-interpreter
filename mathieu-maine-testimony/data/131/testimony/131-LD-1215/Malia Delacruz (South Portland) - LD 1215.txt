LD 1215
Good afternoon, members of the Health and Human Services Committee. My name is
Malia Delacruz, and I am a parent in South Portland. I am submitting a today to 
testimony in favor of LD 1215, An Act To End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco 
Products.
As a parent of 11 and 7 year olds, I care about the mental and physical health and 
well-being of the children and adults in my community. Within the our community, I 
am seeing more and more kids and adults use flavored tobacco products and it worries
me for my kids' future. It's time to limit the availability and stop selling all flavored 
tobacco products in Maine. Flavored tobacco products need to be banned. Please vote 
"yes" on LD 1215.
