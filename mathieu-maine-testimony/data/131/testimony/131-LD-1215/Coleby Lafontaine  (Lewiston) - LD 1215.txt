I'm not writing in to try to convince anyone that vaping is the safest alternative to 
smoking, but you cant sit here and tell me that the reason for all of this is because it is 
harmful when you do not impose a ban on cigarette smoking in general, we all know 
that this is a big tobacco move. If you want to keep it out of the hands of children then
speak to the parents and the teachers who should be monitoring this and regulating it 
on their own domain, you take away flavored tobacco you are just punishing adults 
who are old enough to make their own decisions, kids will just go back to stealing 
their parents cigarettes this doesn't solve the claimed problem it only puts money into 
certain pockets.
