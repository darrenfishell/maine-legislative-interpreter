I am a Maine resident, and I do not support this ban. If there were truly a health 
concern, efforts would have been made to ban cigarettes first. Flavored vape products 
are not legally purchased by persons under the age of 18, just like fruit-flavored 
alcohol cannot lawfully be sold to persons under the age of 21. There is no consistent 
logic behind this ban.
