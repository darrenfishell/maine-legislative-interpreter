Dear Health and Human Services Committee,
I am a manager here at J Brothers Variety.  Knowing what our sales are and where 
the profits are this flavor ban would seriously hurt our business.  We have over a 
dozen employees on our payroll, and if we lose entire segments of our product lines 
with nothing to replace them immediately hours for employees would be cut and then 
eventually some would lose their jobs.  Tobacco especially flavored tobacco is a 
staple amongst our customers.  If they cannot get those products here, they simply 
won’t come into the store.  Which means we lose all of our other inside sales from 
these customers, and if they are travelling let’s say to New Hampshire for their 
tobacco that is also where they will fill up their gas tanks!  What is the point of this 
ban?  Why are you trying to ban flavored tobacco when marijuana is legal, and you 
can buy THC gummy bears everywhere you go now?  This is nothing but hypocrisy at
its worst and trying to get rid of tobacco piecemeal.  Please do us all a favor and leave
flavored tobacco alone!  We have other much more pressing issues in this state – 
VOTE NO!
Respectfully,
