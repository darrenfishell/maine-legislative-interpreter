IN OPPOSITION  - LD 1215 ‘An Act to End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products’  
April 25, 2023  
Dear Senator Baldacci  - Chair, Representative Meyer  - Chair, and the Committee on Health and Human Services,  
 
The Maine Grocers & Food Producers Association and the Retail Association of Maine are  jointly  opposed to LD 
1215 that seeks to ban flavored tobacco products  statewide . Unfortunately, we’re unable to be here in person 
today as we’re hosting our association ’s annual meeting an d professional development conference. Our 
business trade associations represent Main Street businesses including independently owned and operated 
grocery stores and supermarkets, general merchandise retailers, and convenience stores, distributors and 
supp orting partners — together representing more than 450 members statewide. Maine’s retail sector employs 
more than 85,000 Mainers.  
We urge the Committee to oppose the proposed flavored tobacco ban. While it is a laudable effort, it is a 
regressive approach a nd ineffective. Banning flavored tobacco will shift sales away from licensed, trained 
professional retailers and springboard smuggling and counterfeit activities. It will multiply the existing illegal 
market in Maine, reward criminal smugglers, and cost Maine businesses, workers, and taxpayers’ money.   
“A new report  by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation ranks Massachusetts as the ninth highest s tate for inbound 
illegal tobacco smuggling, with an estimated loss of more than $172 million in revenue in 2020. The report 
estimates more than 26% of the cigarettes consumed in the state are from the black market. New Hampshire 
had the highest rate of out bound smuggling in the nation, or 52.4%, which the report’s authors attributed to the 
Granite State’s low tax rates and proximity to high -tax states like Massachusetts.”1  
“Additionally, New Hampshire saw their tobacco revenues increase after Massachusett s passed their ban. The 
state collects millions in tobacco taxes, much of it from out -of-staters. Taxes on cigarettes, loose tobacco and 
other products such as e -cigarettes brought in approximately $232 million in fiscal year 2022. People living 
outside th e state paid 52.4 percent of it, Stepp said. Massachusetts’ decision in 2020 to ban flavored tobacco 
seems to be driving some of those outside sales; tobacco sales have gone up 22 percent since then, particularly 
in border towns.”2

 Maine wholesalers and retailers promote and take very seriously the responsible sales of licensed tobacco 
products.  Retail strategies to prevent tobacco use by underage youth involve due diligence including staff 
training, in store tools and ongoing management.  Maine retailer s embrace the National We Card Program, 
Maine’s No Buts! Program, FDA Tobacco Training Materials and other training programs provided by wholesale 
and industry partners to combat  underage tobacco purchase attempts.  From all accounts, these safeguards are 
working.  The most recent data, for FY 22 (October 21 – September 22 ) specific to Maine the FDA ‘Compliance 
Check Inspections of Tobacco Product Retailers’ 1,152 inspections were performed, 46 incidents involved a 
minor, a 96% compliance rate ( compared to New Hampshire’s 78% compliance rate ). 
 
MGFPA and RAM oppose a Flavored Tobacco Ban:  
• Bans do not stop the purchases - they simply switch the point of purchase. In learning from 
Massachusetts, whose flavored tobacco ban went into effect in June 2020 , “In fact, the flavor ban has 
been far from successful, as sales in both New Hampshire and Rhod e Island experienced double -digit 
growth —almost making up for the entire decrease in Massachusetts. As it happens, looking at the New 
England region as a whole confirms that the flavor ban did not work as intended. Sales moved around 
rather than disappeare d, and the ban evidently did not impact consumption.”3 
• New Hampshire retailers have made a strong effort to entice consumers from outside its borders to 
shop. They actively campaign to target out of state consumers to purchase tobacco, spirits, wine, beer , 
milk and lottery tickets. As adult smokers shift their purchases across state lines, Maine will take the 
brunt and loose out. Lost sales hurt the bottom lines of our grocers and mom -and-pop markets as 
cigarettes are often purchased with other items.  “The  report notes that sales of cigarettes in New 
Hampshire increased by 22% in the year following Massachusetts’ 2020 menthol ban. Sales in New 
Hampshire and Rhode Island are 10% higher in 2021 than in 2019 because of cross -border 
Massachusetts shoppers and s mugglers, according to the report.”  
• A tunnel -vision approach to banning a product will result in lost sales both of tobacco products and 
other commonly purchased goods including food, beverages, and gas typically purchased alongside 
tobacco items. This pol icy will cause compounded financial harm to Maine’s  1,440 licensed , responsible  
tax-paying businesses.  
 
The Committee and Maine’s legislature must strike a balance between protecting Maine’s youth and economic 
viability for Maine’s tobacco retailers. MGFPA  and RAM  suppor t efforts that increase access barriers and 
improved education without hindering the market.   
 
These Maine stores continue to experience labor and supply shortages, they’re continuing to cope with 
escalating labor and energy costs , and have been tirelessl y working to ensure Mainers have safe access to food.  
We ask the Committee to vote Ought Not to Pass on the proposed product ban.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony.
