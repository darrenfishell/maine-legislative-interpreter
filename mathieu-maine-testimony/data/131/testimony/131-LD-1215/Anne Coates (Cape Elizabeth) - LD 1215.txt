LD 1215: An Act to End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products. 
 
Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak with you all today. My name is Dr. Annie 
Coates, I am a pediatric pulmonologist, board member of the Maine Chapter of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and I am passionate about educating our young and communities about 
the harmful effects of flavored tobacco products. 
The focus of todayâ€™s testimony is specifically on menthol flavored tobacco products. Menthol is 
a commonly used chemical primarily derived from peppermint or corn mint plants. It has 
multiple different medicinal properties, the vast majority of which are not why tobacco 
companies add it to their products. Instead, they are capitalizing on its local anesthetic properties 
which effectively numb or cool the respiratory tract, especially the nose, mouth and throat. 
Menthol also suppresses the cough reflex and possibly dilates the bronchi (or small airways 
within the chest) and enable deeper inhalation and tolerability of inhaled smoke. 
Furthermore, studies have shown menthol cigarette smoking resulted in slower nicotine 
metabolism or breakdown and lower total nicotine clearance in the body. Ultimately, this leads to 
higher nicotine dependence and therefore greater difficulty in quitting. 
Approximately 90% of all African American smokers use menthol cigarettes. Menthol also 
appears to alter cell membranes throughout the body resulting in greater potential for tobacco 
related deaths from heart disease, cancer and stroke which are the 3 leading causes of death for 
African Americans in the USA. 
This is entirely preventable. 
As a pediatric pulmonologist, as a mother, as a resident of Maine who has dedicated my career to 
the health of our communities, please your voice and support this critical legislation. The 
wellbeing of our youth, the African American community and other minority populations depend 
on it.
