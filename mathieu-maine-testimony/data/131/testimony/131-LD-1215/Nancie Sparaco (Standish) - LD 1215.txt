Dear Members of the Health & Human Services Committee:
My name is Nancie Sparaco. I am a resident of Standish and am asking you to please 
support ending the sale of flavored tobacco products.
I started smoking when I was 14. I picked Virginia Slims because of the advertising 
and I wanted to look cool. Teens today are no different. The tobacco industry knows 
that - and in manufacturing and marketing e-cigarettes, they are targeting these kids. 
With more than 15,000 flavors on the market, devices that look like USB drives, and 
even hooded sweatshirts with e-cigarettes, the industry is leveraging their rebellious 
age to get them addicted to their products. The added rush of knowing their parents 
may not recognize the e-cigarette, or that they sneak in a puff while in class, makes it
more likely they will try and continue to use these products.
I stopped smoking when I was 27. My niece, at the time 3 years old, imitated me by 
using a pencil to pretend she was smoking. I wanted to be a role model for her and I 
quit that day, cold turkey. It was not easy, and it bothers me to know that we now 
have a youth vaping epidemic.
Please support this legislation. Thank you.
