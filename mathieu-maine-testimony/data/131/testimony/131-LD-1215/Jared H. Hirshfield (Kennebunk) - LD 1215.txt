Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee 
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
testimony
regarding
LDs 
1 174
and
1215.
Flavored
tobacco
products
through
the
use
of
an
electronic
cigarette
helped
me
quit 
smoking
cigarettes.
Prior
to
the
advent
of
electronic
cigarettes,
or
vaporizers,
I
was
smoking 
nearly
a
pack
a
day
of
traditional
combustible
cigarettes.
Flavored
tobacco
products
and
vapes 
are
smoking
cessation
products
and
should
be
treated
as
such.
While
I
understand
the
sponsors’ 
fears
of
these
products
getting
into
the
hands
of
children,
there
will
be
harm
done
to
the
countless 
adults
who
use
flavored
tobacco
products
as
they
are
intended.
If
these
bans
were
to
pass,
more
adults
will
revert
to
smoking
traditional
combustible 
tobacco.
As
a
resident
of
Southern
Maine,
I
may
just
drive
across
the
border
to
New
Hampshire 
and
purchase
my
flavored
tobacco
products
there.
I’m
sure
the
State
of
New
Hampshire
will 
gladly
accept
the
increase
in
revenue
from
many
Mainers
buying
their
tobacco
products
there.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
