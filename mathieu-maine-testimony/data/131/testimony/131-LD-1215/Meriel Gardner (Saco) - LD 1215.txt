I was born and raised in Maine and I am also a tobacco user. I truly believe that adults
should have the right to purchase and use any kind of tobacco product that is on the 
market. It should not matter what flavor the tobacco product is. If these products are 
legal to sell and approved by FDA for adult consumption I think it is ridiculous for 
the state to overstep and discriminate against certain groups of adult tobacco users.
