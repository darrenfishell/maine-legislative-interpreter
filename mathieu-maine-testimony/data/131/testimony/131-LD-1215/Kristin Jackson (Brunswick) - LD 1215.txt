LD 1215
My name is Kristin Jackson, I'm a Brunswick resident and a mother, and I'm 
submitting testimony in strong support of LD 1215, An Act to End the Sale of 
Flavored Tobacco Products.
My dad was a pack-a-day smoker from when he was a teenager up until the day he 
died (at the young age of 58). I saw the addictive hold nicotine had over him. When 
my siblings and I were in D.A.R.E and learning about how bad smoking was for you, 
we begged him to stop. We'd steal his cigarettes and throw them in the toilet. He'd 
always just go out and buy more. 
My generation was making incredible strides at reducing tobacco use, but e-cigarettes 
and flavored tobacco products have drastically reversed that trend. 90% of young 
adults who use e-cigarettes use flavored products and 4 out of 5 kids started using 
tobacco with flavored products. I have friends who would never smoke a traditional 
cigarette, but can't put down their mango juul pods.
We need to stop prioritizing corporate profit over public health. Tobacco companies 
use flavored tobacco products and aggressive marketing tactics to target and hook 
kids and marginalized communities. 
Please support LD 1215 and end the sale of flavored tobacco products that are 
harming our health, taxing our healthcare systems, costing our taxpayers, and setting 
our youth up for a lifetime of addiction.
