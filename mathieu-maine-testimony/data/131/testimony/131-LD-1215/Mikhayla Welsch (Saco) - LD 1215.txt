I don’t believe flavored tobacco products should be banned. Kids are not buying 
vapes and flavored nicotine from legal 21+ stores. Lawmakers are so out of touch 
they don’t realize there’s an underground market for nicotine just like everything else.
By making flavored nicotine illegal you are doing nothing but creating a bigger black 
market and unsafe products that are not FDA regulated. As somebody who was forced
to go through the DARE program,  you told us all that weed was the gateway drug 
and told us if we ever smoked weed we were going to get addicted to meth or heroine,
now there’s a dispensary on every street corner. It’s the most hypocritical thing this 
state could ever do. I think Maine has bigger issues to deal with right now than 
banning flavored nicotine. The fentanyl epidemic is killing more Mainers than 
nicotine ever will. I think you would also be more focused on the fact that average 
rent in this state is now almost $2,000 a month and homelessness is on the rise. You 
are taking away our rights as Mainers and making this state unbearable to live in.
