Maine Legislature 
Health and Human Services Committee 
LD 1215 - End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products 
Testimony in Support 
 
Dear Members of the Health and Human Services Committee 
 
I am writing to ask that you support LD 1215 and end the sale of flavored tobacco products in 
Maine. I began smoking cigarettes in the mid-1960s at the age of 16 and smoked three packs a 
day for nearly 40 years. I can attest to the dangerous, addictive qualities of tobacco products. I 
was lucky enough to quit smoking, but I know firsthand the lifelong health impacts that come 
along with using tobacco products. 
 
That is why I fully support legislation to ban flavored tobacco products in Maine. These products 
are marketed to young people with bright colors and sweet flavors, making them more 
appealing and less intimidating to try. This is a tactic that the tobacco industry has used for 
years to hook young people on their products and ensure a lifelong addiction. 
 
As someone who started smoking at a young age, I can say that I was naive to the dangers of 
smoking and how it could impact my health in the long run. It wasn't until years later that I 
realized the severity of my addiction and the harm I was causing to myself. 
 
Flavored tobacco products make it even easier for young people to start smoking and become 
addicted. They hide the harsh taste of tobacco and make it seem like a harmless and enjoyable 
activity. But the truth is, there is no safe amount of tobacco use, and the health consequences 
can be severe and long-lasting. 
 
I urge lawmakers in Maine to take action and ban flavored tobacco products to protect our youth 
from the harmful effects of tobacco use. As someone who has experienced the dangers of 
tobacco addiction firsthand, I know how important it is to prevent young people from starting this 
deadly habit. Let's work together to ensure a healthier future for our communities. 
 
Thank you,
