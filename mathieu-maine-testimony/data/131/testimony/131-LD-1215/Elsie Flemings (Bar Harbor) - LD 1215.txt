Good
afternoon,
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services:
my
name
is
Elsie
Flemings,
I
am
speaking
as
a
parent
and
a
resident
of
Bar
Harbor ,
a
community
which
recently
passed
a
flavored
tobacco
ban.
I
am
testifying
in
favor
of
LD
1215,
An
Act
T o
End
the
Sale
of
Flavored
T obacco
Products.
While
Bar
Harbor
joined
Portland,
Brunswick,
Bangor ,
and
South
Portland
in
passing
a
full
flavored
tobacco
ban,
it’ s
critically
important
to
extend
the
protection
that
we
are
giving
our
children
in
Bar
Harbor
to
other
communities
statewide
.
I
know
this
as
a
parent,
looking
ahead
to
the
choices
that
my
own
young
children
will
face
as
they
navigate
the
world,
subjected
to
the
pressures
by
tobacco
companies
looking
for
future
customers
and
exploiting
the
natural
risk-taking
phase
of
youth
brain
development.
I
know
this
also
with
the
added
perspective
af forded
to
me
as
the
Executive
Director
of
Healthy
Acadia,
a
non-profit
community
health
or ganization
which
primarily
serves
W ashington
and
Hancock
counties
and
partners
with
other
or ganizations
across
the
state.
Given
that
tobacco
use
remains
the
leading
cause
of
preventable
death
and
disease
nationwide,
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
future
deaths
from
tobacco
use.
Banning
flavors
to
reduce
youth
initiation
is
an
important
and
meaningful
next
step.
Early
youth
use
of
nicotine
and
tobacco
products
have
profoundly
negative
impacts
on
those
youth
and
on
our
communities.
T obacco
companies
specifically
tar get
young
people
with
flavored
tobacco
products,
using
tar geted
online
marketing
techniques
that
often
don’ t
register
with
parents
and
other
adults
because
they
don’ t
see
the
same
advertisements.
Nicotine
use
is
linked
to
increased
anxiety
and
depression,
a
serious
concern
when
we
are
already
seeing
high
numbers
of
youth
experiencing
mental
health
struggles.
And
youth
and
young
adults
are
also
much
more
susceptible
to
nicotine
addiction,
which
can
in
turn
increase
risk
for
addiction
to
other
substances.
Keeping
flavored
tobacco
out
of
the
hands
of
our
youth
will
help
to
protect
them,
and
that
is
the
primary
focus
here,
but
it
will
help
to
protect
our
communities
as
a
whole,
too.
It’ s
so
easy
to
think
of
substance
use,
and
tobacco
use
in
particular ,
as
a
personal
choice,
and
therefore,
presumably
one
that
doesn’ t
impact
the
people
around
us.
Because
nicotine
is
less
intoxicating,
it
can
seem
relatively
harmless
compared
to
substances
that
are
more
intoxicating.
However ,
in
the
end,
tobacco
kills
nearly
half
a
million
people
per
year ,
which
is
more
than
alcohol,
AIDS,
car
accidents,
illegal
drugs,
murders,
and
suicides
combined
(
tobaccofreekids.or g
).
Its
use
also
harms
community
members'
ef forts
to
be
successful
in
recovery ,
and
we
know
that
nicotine,
when
consumed
with
other
substances
like
opioids,
results
in
a
greater
consumption
of
both
substances.
The
negative
ef fects
of
nicotine
addiction
have
far -reaching
and
powerfully
negative
impacts
on
our
youth,
their
futures,
and
just
as
importantly ,
on
their
families.
Any
young
person
who
grows
up
to
be
tobacco-free
helps
our
whole
state
in
so
many
ways.
Our
youth
are
our
future;
this
is
an
issue
that
can
bring
all
of
us
together .
Please
protect
our
children
and
other
vulnerable
populations
in
our
community
by
voting
“yes”
to
support
LD
1215,
the
ban
on
the
sale
of
flavored
tobacco
products.
Thank
you!
