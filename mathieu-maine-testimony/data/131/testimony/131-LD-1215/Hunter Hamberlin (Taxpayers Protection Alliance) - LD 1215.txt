In 2021, 15.6 percent of adults were currently smoking in Maine. This is a 5.5
percent decrease from 2020.
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 6.3 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, 22.2
percent of 25–44-year-olds, 19.4 percent of 45–64-year-olds, and 7.8 percent of
adults aged 65 years or older were currently smoking combustible cigarettes.
Among all adults earning $25,000 or less in 2021, 36.5 percent were currently
smoking compared to only 9.5 percent of adults earning $50,000 or more.
Among all smoking adults in 2021 in Maine, 94 percent were White, 2.6 percent
were Multiracial, 1.9 percent were Hispanic, and 1.8 percent were American
Indian/Native Alaskan.
Cigarette excise taxes in Maine disproportionately impact low-income persons
and lower educated adults, while failing to significantly reduce smoking rates
among that class.
The percent of Maine adults earning $25,000 or less that were smoking increased
by 16.4 percent between 2005 and 2021, while the percent of adults earning
$50,000 or more that were smoking decreased by 26.9 percent during the same
period. 
Among Mainers who did not graduate high school, smoking rates increased by
3.3 percent, yet rates among adults with a college degree decreased by 29.4
percent. 
In 2021, 5.8 percent of adults reported past-month e-cigarette use, which was a
41.5 percent increase from 2017. 
Youth vaping seems to have peaked in 2019 when 20 percent of youth reported
current e-cigarette use. Between 2019 and 2022, current e-cigarette use declined
by 53 percent. 
Traditional tobacco use among youth is at record lows. In 2022, only 1.9 percent
of U.S. youth reported current cigar use, 1.6 percent reported current
combustible cigarette use and, 1.3 percent reported using smokeless tobacco
products. 
The introduction of e-cigarettes has not led to increases in cigarette smoking, but
rather, correlates with significant declines in smoking rates among young adults. 
Between 2007 and 2018, smoking rates among Maine adults aged 18 to 24 years
old declined by 49.8 percent. Since 2018, young adult smoking rates have
decreased another 56.3 percent, with average annual declines of 21.3 percent.
Maine woefully underfunds programs to prevent youth use of tobacco and/or
vapor products and help adults quit smoking, while simultaneously receiving
millions of dollars from the pockets of the adults who smoke. In 2021, for every
$1 the state received in tobacco monies, it spent only $0.08 on tobacco control
efforts.Tobacco & Vaping 101:

Lawmakers are often bombarded with misinformation on the products used by adults in their state. This
annual analysis provides up-to-date data on the adults who use cigarettes and e-cigarette products in Maine.
This information also includes data on youth use, impacts of e-cigarettes and analyses of existing tobacco
monies.Key Points: 
In 2021, according to data from the annual Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (BRFSS)
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 15.6 percent of Mainers were currently
smoking, amounting to an estimated 174,772 a dults.
This is a 5.5 percent decrease from 2020. In 2021, 12.1
percent of Maine adults reported smoking every day. 
Smoking rates in the Pine Tree State have significantly
declined since 1995 when the BRFSS first began
reporting combustible cigarette use. That year, 25
percent of Maine adults were then-currently smoking.
Between 1995 and 2021, smoking rates have decreased
by 37.6 percent, with average annual decreases of 1.5
percent.
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 6.3 percent of 18- to
24-year-olds, 22.2 percent of 25–44-year-olds, 19.4
percent of 45–64-year-olds, and 7.8 percent of adults
aged 65 years or older were currently smoking
combustible cigarettes.
Among all adults earning $25,000 annually or less in
2021, more than one-third (36.5 percent) reported
currently smoking, compared to only 9.5 percent of
adults who earned $50,000 or more per year.
In Maine, American Indian/Native Alaskan adults
reported smoking at a greater percentage of their
identified race at 29.7 percent. This is compared to 28.8
percent of Multiracial adults, 16 percent of Hispanic
adults. and 15.3 percent of White adults.
Yet, White adults made up a significantly larger
percentage of Maine’s total adult smoking popul ation.
In 2021, White adults accounted for 94 percent of the
state’s current smoking population, compared to
American Indian/Native Alaskan adults, who m ade up
only 1.8 percent of the current adult smoking
population. Multiracial adults made up 2.6 percent of
the smoking population and Hispanic adults accounted
for 1.9 percent of Maine’s adult smoking popul ation in
2021.Adult Combustible Cigarette Use

Effects of Cigarette Taxes
Adult E-Cigarette Use
The CDC provides data on adult e-cigarette use for only 2016, 2017, and 2021.
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 5.8 percent were currently using e-cigarettes. This is a 41.5 percent increase from
2017 when 4.4 percent of Maine adults were current e-cigarette users. 
In 2021 (among all Maine adults), 20 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, 9.3 percent of 25–44-year-olds, 2.8 percent of
55–64-year-olds, and one percent of adults aged 65 years or older were currently using e-cigarettes. 
Among adults earning $25,000 or less, 7.9 percent reported current e-cigarette use, compared to 5.1 percent who
reported earning $50,000 or more. 
In Maine, 5.7 percent of White adults were currently vaping in 2021. There is no data for other races.Maine last increased its state cigarette excise tax in 2005 from $1.98 to $2.98-per-pack. Lawmakers often justify
excise taxes on cigarettes to deter persons from using combustible cigarettes. These taxes not only disproportionately
harm lower income and lower educated adults, the taxes also fail to significantly reduce smoking rates among those
persons. 
The percent of Maine adults earning $25,000 or less that were smoking increased by 16.4 percent between 2005 and
2021, while the percent of adults earning $50,000 or more that were smoking decreased by 26.9 percent during the
same period. Among Mainers who did not graduate high school, smoking rates increased by 3.3 percent, yet rates
among adults with a college degree decreased by 29.4 percent. 
Lawmakers should refrain from enacting further increases in cigarette taxes given their disproportionate effect on
low-income and low-educated persons, while failing to reduce smoking rates.

Young Adult Smoking Rates
As e-cigarettes have disrupted the traditional tobacco
market, policymakers have shifted their attention towards
youth use and subsequent smoking initiation. Despite the
rhetoric, the introduction of e-cigarettes has not led to
increases in young adult cigarette smoking, but rather,
correlates with significant declines. 
E-cigarettes first came to U.S. market in 2007 when 28.7
percent of Mainers aged 18 to 24 years old were currently
smoking. In 2018, public health purported to a so-called
“youth vaping epidemic” when 14.4 percent of young
adults in the Pine Tree State were smoking. Between
2007 and 2018, young adult smoking rates declined by
49.8 percent. Further, since 2018, young adult smoking
rates have decreased another 56.3 percent, with average
annual declines of 21.3 percent. 
Though data is limited to only three years, increases in
vaping correlate with decreases in smoking.
In 2017 (among 18- to 24-year-olds), 15.1 percent and 9.7
percent were currently using combustible cigarettes and
e-cigarettes, respectively. Between 2017 and 2021,
current cigarette use among young adults decreased by
58.3 percent while vapor product use increased by 106
percent.
Given the epic lows in young adult smoking rates,
lawmakers must refrain from policies that restrict access
to alternatives to smoking. Youth Smoking and Vaping Rates
The CDC continues to delay publishing the 2021 results of
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey resulting in state-specific
data being unavailable at the time of this publication.
Nonetheless, youth use of vapor products has declined
significantly in recent years and youth use of traditional
tobacco products is at record lows. 
In 2022 (according to the National Youth Tobacco
Survey), only 9.4 percent of middle and high school
students reported current use of e-cigarette products,
defined as having used a product on at least one occasion
in the 30 days prior to the survey. Youth vaping seems to
have peaked in 2019, when 20 percent of youth reported
current e-cigarette use. Between 2019 and 2022, current e-
cigarette use declined by 53 percent. 
In 2022 (regarding traditional tobacco products), only 1.9
percent of U.S. youth reported current cigar use, 1.6
percent reported current combustible cigarette use and 1.3
percent reported using smokeless tobacco products.
Between 2019 and 2022, current cigar use declined by
64.2 percent, current cigarette use by 62.8 percent and
smokeless tobacco use by 62.9 percent. 
Given the record lows in youth tobacco use and continued
declines in youth vapor product use, policymakers must
refrain from prohibitionist policies that would hinder adult
access to harm reduction products.

Each year, states receive billions of dollars borne out of the lungs of persons who smoke. This revenue includes
excise cigarette taxes and settlement payments. Yet, each year, states spend miniscule amounts of tobacco-related
monies on programs to help adults quit smoking and prevent youth use. 
In 2021, the Pine Tree State collected an estimated $112.8 million in state excise tax revenue from combustible
cigarettes. This was a 6.5 percent decrease from 2020’s $120.6 million. Between 2000 and 2021, Maine collected
more than $2.6 billion in cigarette taxes. 
Since 2000 Maine has collected annual payments from tobacco manufacturers based on the percentage of cigarettes
and tobacco products sold in the state in that year. Maine collected $48.6 million in settlement payments in 2021, a
5.2 percent increase from 2020’s $46.2 million. Since 2000 the Pine Tree State collected over $1.1 billion in tobacco
settlement payments. 
While Maine collected an estimated $161.4 million in tobacco-related monies in 2021, the state allocated only $13.9
million in state funding towards tobacco control programs, including cessation, education, and youth prevention
efforts, which was a 17.8 percent increase in funding from 2020 levels. This amounts to 12.3 percent of taxes and
28.6 percent of settlement payments. In 2021, for every $1 the state received in tobacco monies, it spent only $0.08
on tobacco control efforts.Tobacco Monies
