 
 Greeting Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members 
of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services,  
 
 My names is Blue Butterfield and I am a practicing physician 
assistant and mother of two teenage boys in Portland Maine. I am asking 
you to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products on both a professional and 
personal level.  
 Everyday at work at Maine Medical Center, I am overwhelmed by the 
amount of tobacco-associated disease I see. It’s not just lung cancer that 
my patients are dying from, it’s the chronic obstructive lung disease so 
severe that patients can’t walk from the bed to the bathroom without 
gasping for breath. They have terrible vascular disease with a narrowing of 
their arteries that makes it difficult to walk because of leg pain.  
 My sons report to me that vaping of flavored products is rampant at 
their high school and it is infuriating that addictive products that are 
marketed for children are legal and accessible across the state.  
 I have been working in medicine for 25 years and have never 
encountered a smoker who didn’t pick it up in their teenage (or earlier!) 
years.  
 I beg you for the health of our children and future adults, as well as 
the toll it takes on our medical delivery system, to ban these substances 
that were created to addict a new generation. 
 
Sincerely,
