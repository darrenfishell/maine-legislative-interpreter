Dear Health & Human Services Committee Members:
My name is Jayne Boulos. I am a lifelong Mainer and current resident of Cape 
Elizabeth. I am urging you to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products (LD 1215).
These products are dangerous to all people but especially children. As a former 
registered respiratory therapist and now a licensed psychologist who works with 
children, I know firsthand the danger that tobacco products can cause. The flavors 
used in these products make them more dangerous than unflavored tobacco because 
they taste like candy and other desserts.
I also know how impressionable children are and how they may not think about 
long-term consequences when picking up a bad habit. Tobacco companies are famous
for targeting vulnerable populations such as children. Please ban the sale of these 
dangerous products in Maine. Thank you.
