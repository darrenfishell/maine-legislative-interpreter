I’m 58 yrs old,was a cigarette smoker for 30 yrs.I tried vaping and it helped to 
eventually stop smoking cigarettes,since then I have stopped coughing and have less 
respiratory illnesses and have not had to use an inhaler.Please don’t ban this product, 
kids will find another way to buy illegally and it will then be cigarettes which is more 
harmful.
