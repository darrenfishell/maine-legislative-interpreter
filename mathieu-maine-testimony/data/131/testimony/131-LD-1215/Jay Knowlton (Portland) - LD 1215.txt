Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services:  
 
My name is Jay Knowlton. I am a lifelong Mainer, having grown up in Camden, and currently a 
resident of Portland. I graduated from  the University of Maine  and earned my Master of Public 
Health degree from the University of Southern Maine. I currently serve  as Board President of 
Maine Public Health Association, in addition to other volunteer activities in my community. T he 
health of Maine people and places is important to me, and I’m writing to you as a public health 
professional, and resident of this beauti ful state , in support of  LD 1215: “An Act To End the Sale 
of Flavored Tobacco Products .”  
 This bill would end the sale and marketing of all flavored tobacco products, including prohibiting the use of “characterizing” terms , a tactic that  has been used by the tobacco industry 
for marketing purposes and to dodge regulation.  
 Maine’s next generation is rapidly becoming dependent on tobacco products , setting  them 
up for chronic health conditions, lost productivity, and economic challenges . For example, f rom 
2017- 2019, there was a near doubling in youth e -cigarette use (28.7% vs. 15.3%), with some of 
the greatest increases seen in Piscataquis (26.6% vs. 6.7%) and Oxford (30.9% vs. 12.3%) counties.
1 Being in my late twenties, I have seen fir sthand how flavored tobacco can get people 
hooked, w ith many of my friends trying e -cigarettes and now seeing several of them spending a 
lot of money on them every week, unable to stop despite trying multiple times.  The costs on our health and health care are significant : In Maine, smoking is estimated to 
cost $811 million in direct health care expenditures, including $261 million in Medicaid costs, and an additional $647 million in productivity losses every year.
1 Each year, 2,400 Maine people 
die from tobacco- related illness.2 
 Maine voters support ending the sale of flavored tobacco products . In the spring of 2019, 
MPHA received funding from Maine Cancer Foundation to conduct a public opinion poll about a 
range of tobacco -related issues , including ending the sale of flavored tobacco products . The poll 
found that  a large, bipartisan majority of Maine voters support ending  the sale of all 
flavored tobacco products  (including cigars and e -cigarettes) to prevent yout h tobacco use 
(68% support: 75% Liberal, 67% Moderate, 62% Conservative). I’ve attached these results to my testimony.  
 Five municipalities across the state have ended the sale of all flavored tobacco products. The state’s inaction to date on this issue is  nothing to be proud of , and Maine kids are paying the 
price.  Data suggest 27,000 Maine kids now under the age of 18 will ultimately die 
prematurely from tobacco  use.

 We need to act today to create a healthier tomorrow for Maine kids . Preventing toba cco use 
is good public health, economic and social  policy. LD 1215 promotes public health, and I 
respectfully request the committee vote LD 1215 “Ought to Pass.” Thank you for your 
consideration.

Mainers Strongly Support Tobacco Taxes & Ending the 
Sale of Flavored Tobacco P roducts  
 
Adopting policies that protect Maine youth from tobacco addiction is a high priority for an overwhelming  
bipartisan majority of Maine voters, according to a comprehensive poll  conducted by DRI -Critical Insights. The 
poll, commissioned by MPHA and funded by Maine Cancer Foundation, demonstrates that Maine people value 
public health and preventing addiction among Maine ’s youth.  
 
This is the first poll of Maine voters to be conducted since e -cigarettes were introduced on the market. Of 
particular note, the survey shows that 85% of Maine voters believe it is important to prevent Maine youth 
from using tobacco products . Also noteworthy is that strong support comes from men and women; across 
ages; geography ; self-reported tobacco use; and political l eaning: Liberal, Moderate and Conservative.  
 
Poll Highlights:  
On other issues, the poll found that a large, bipartisan majority of Maine voters support:  
• Prohibiting the sale of all  flavored tobacco products (including cigars and e -cigarettes) to prevent 
youth tobacco use (68% support:  75% Liberal, 67% Moderate, 62% Conservative) , and  
• Using tax revenue from an increase in tobacco taxes to prevent youth from starting to smoke or use 
other tobacco products (70% support:  85% Liberal, 64% Moderate, 54% Conservative ). 
 
More than 70% of Maine voters don’t buy the false claim that e -cigarettes  can help cigarette smokers to quit 
smoking ; in fact, nearly the same percentage (73%) believe e -cigarettes, Juuls, and other vaping products 
increase nicotine addiction among youth and young adults  (79% Liberal, 62% Moderate, 61% Conservative ). 
 
Respondents from across  political views  report leaning favorably toward political candidates that vote to:
