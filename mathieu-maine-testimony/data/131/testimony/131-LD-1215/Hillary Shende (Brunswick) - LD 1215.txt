LD 1215
Esteemed members of the Heath and Human Services Committee, my name is Hillary
Shende, and I am in favor of LD 1215.
As a mother of two children in Brunswick, I am so grateful that our town council 
banned the sale of flavored tobacco products within our municipality sometime back. 
It reduced easy access to these products by Brunswick kids. Bangor and Portland have
taken similar action, but the rest of the state’s population remains vulnerable to the 
dangerous addiction that vaping products bring about. I am sure you will hear from 
many medical experts who will detail the level of lifelong harm these products cause, 
but as a lay person, I just want to say that Brunswick, Portland, and Bangor kids 
shouldn’t be the only ones protected from these harms. All Maine kids deserve to be 
protected from these dangers. Please vote “ought to pass.” Thank you.
