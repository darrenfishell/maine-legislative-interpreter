Before
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services
April
25,
2023
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer ,
and
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
&
Human
Services:
My
name
is
Kathleen
Meil
and
I
serve
as
Senior
Director
of
Policy
&
Partnerships
at
Maine
Conservation
V oters.
Our
or ganization
represents
more
than
13,000
members
and
supporters
dedicated
to
protecting
Maine’ s
environment
and
our
democracy .
T oday ,
that
means
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1215,
“An
Act
to
End
the
Sale
of
Flavored
T obacco.”
Flavored
tobacco,
most
commonly
consumed
through
e-cigarettes,
poses
myriad
public
health
and
environmental
hazards.
Demand
for
these
products
among
high
school
students
increased
1,000%
between
2019
and
2020,
and
with
more
than
15,000
flavors
like
bubblegum
and
cotton
candy ,
they
are
clearly
designed
to
hook
kids.
This
predatory
practice
comes
as
no
surprise;
the
tobacco
industry
wrote
the
playbook
for
all
industries
that
rely
on
deceptive,
damaging
practices
that
harm
human,
environmental,
and
ecological
health,
and
openly
refers
to
our
children
as
“replacement
smokers.”

This
Committee
will
hear
copious
testimony
on
the
devastating
health
impacts
of
flavored
tobacco
and
the
long-term
consequences
of
nicotine
addiction.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
shares
those
concerns;
we’re
not
striving
to
address
the
climate
crisis
and
shore
up
our
democratic
systems
just
to
have
our
kids’
futures
derailed
by
the
tobacco
industry .
On
top
of
that,
e-cigarettes
are
an
environmental
disaster .
Every
discarded
e-cigarette
contains
a
lithium-ion
battery
that
could
be
recycled.
Lithium
is
a
critical
mineral
used
to
power
everything
from
mobile
phones
to
electric
cars,
and
we
must
use
and
reuse
it
strategically
as
we
shift
away
from
fossil
fuels.
It’ s
both
shocking
and
shameful
that

“five
disposable
vapes
are
being
thrown
away
every
second….
over
a
year ,
this
amounts
to
150
million
devices…
[and]
enough
lithium
for
about
6,000
T eslas.”

The
lithium
in
e-cigarettes
could
be
reused,
but
the
devices
themselves
are
considered
hazardous
waste
3
and
aren’ t
recyclable.
Unlike
other
electronics,
e-cigarette
manufacturers
do
not
provide
consumers
with
clear
instructions
on
how
to
properly
handle
e-cigarette
waste
once
the
device
or
its
accessories
reaches
the
“end
of
life.”
They
leave
the
onus
of
figuring
out
how
to
safely
dispose
of
e-cigarettes
to
the
consumer ,
which
is
how
they
end
up
in
all
sorts
of
places.
Indeed,
these
devices
introduce
plastic,
nicotine
salts,
heavy
metals,
lead,
mercury ,
and
flammable
lithium-ion
batteries
into
waterways,
soil,
and
to
wildlife.
They
eventually
break
down
into
microplastics
and
flow
into
storm
drains,
polluting
our
waterways
and
wildlife.
Flavored
tobacco
products
hurt
Maine
people
and
places,
and
disposable
e-cigarettes
squander
lithium
we
need
to
power
the
clean
ener gy
transition.
By
ending
the
sale
of
flavored
tobacco,
LD
1215
will
lessen
the
damage
to
Maine’ s
people,
economy ,
environment,
and
way
of
life.
Maine
Conservation
V oters
supports
LD
1215
and
ur ges
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass.”
Thank
you.
