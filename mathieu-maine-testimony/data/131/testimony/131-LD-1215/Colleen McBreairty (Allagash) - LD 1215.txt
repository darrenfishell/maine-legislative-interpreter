Health and Human Services Committee  
Testimony of Colleen McBreairty in Support of LD 1215 
 
Hello, 
My name is Colleen McBreairty and I am writing in support of LD 1215.  I live in 
Allagash, Maine.  I just recently turned 71 years old.  I started smoking cigarettes 
when I was 14 years old.  Back then anyone who had the money could go into a 
store and buy cigarettes, no questions asked.  As a result, I spent years battling 
bronchitis, and bronchial pneumonia.  This often led to me being hospitalized.  
The last of which was the most serious.  I went into respiratory arrest having 
come down with a combination of an asthma attack coupled with bronchitis, and 
pneumonia.  I was in intensive care for a week.  My doctor told me at that time 
that if I didn’t quit smoking, I would not make it to the hospital again since the 
hospital is about forty miles from where I live.  I was so addicted that my first 
thought was “  that is ok, I will just move closer.”  I had tried to quit smoking 
several times before to no avail.  I would sometimes go as long as two or three 
years before something would happen, and I would reach for a pack of cigarettes 
once again.  For some reason this time it worked.  I have been smoke free for 21 
years in November.   
As a former teacher, the health and welfare of children is very important to me.  I 
have seen the damage that flavored tobacco can do and know how hard it is to 
fight addiction. Although a ban on flavored tobacco under 21 exists, I can tell you 
with all certainty, kids are very resourceful at being able to still get it.   I 
encourage you to end the distribution and sale of flavored tobacco products in 
Maine.  Please support LD 1215.  Thank you for listening. 
Sincerely,  
Colleen McBreairty
