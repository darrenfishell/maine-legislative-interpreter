 
Dear members of the committee on Health and Human Services.  I am submitting testimony in 
opposition to LD1215.  The attempted ban on flavored tobacco products directly contradicts harm 
reduction and substance use advocatesâ€™ attempts at normalizing evidence-based harm reduction 
strategies.  Limiting the availability of adult consumer products is an ineffective way to target underage 
use.  Prohibition of substances has never worked and does not work now; this includes nicotine. 
If the issue is marketing, as proponents of this legislation suggest, then let us have a 
conversation about how to create rules around juvenile targeted marketing.  There is nothing inherent 
about flavored products that is aimed at children.  We all enjoy the flavors of fruit, and cookies, and all 
kinds of things we consume, nothing about that is childish or aimed towards children.  An outright ban 
on the sale of all flavored tobacco products, or a ban on anything for that matter, is a simplified and 
reductive approach to a complex issue. 
Nobody on either side of this issue wants to see children be targeted for nicotine consumption 
or begin using tobacco or nicotine in the first place, but we do not mitigate this very real issue with 
prohibition.  Instead we mitigate this just as we mitigate any other substance use, through 
understanding, education, conversation, and harm reduction strategies.
