Dear distinguished members of the committee on Health and Human Services.  I urge you to oppose LD 
1215.  The last thing we need to do in Maine to address any type of substance use including 
tobacco/nicotine is to enact prohibition on such substances.  We have spent the last century attempting 
to prohibit our way our of a public health issues and it has not been effective.  The only thing that has 
been accomplished is the criminalization of otherwise law abiding citizens.  
 
If LD 1215 were to pass, it would instantly make criminals out of numerous small business owners across 
Maine, as well as thousands of responsible adult tobacco and nicotine users.  I myself was able to 
successfully quit smoking cigarettes by utilizing flavored electronic vaporizers as a harm reduction 
strategy.  I am happy to say that because of the flavored vaporizers available to me, I have not smoked a 
cigarette for over 7 years.  My health and my life is far superior because of this. 
I urge you, please vote against this simplistic attempt at reducing youth tobacco use.  The real issue here 
is education and marketing.  These issues with regards to underage tobacco use can be effectively 
addressed without a blanket prohibition on an entire type of consumer product.
