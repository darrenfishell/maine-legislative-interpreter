Aren't Americans personal freedoms and liberties being erased enough already? Is 
this not the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave? I know that statement is 
debatable but the value behind the words should reign true. Why end something that 
will bring the state more money? I thought that was the whole premise of "meeting 
the quota"? What's next, are you going to end alcohol sales and use as well? Would 
that dabble into your addictions and stress relief from this twisted sick world? What is
to gain from taking away my addiction and stress relief? Why can't I take my cancer 
in the form of how I want it? Is big bigger the tobacco industry running out of money 
and things to do because I highly doubt it. Do the tobacco industry have that much 
power over Maine that you have to end and/or challenge vapers because we like 
blueberry freaking cancer? I really hope you all quit thinking what's best for 
Americans and actually step out in public, take polls from real humans and actually 
take their interests to heart. That would be the real and best way for change.
