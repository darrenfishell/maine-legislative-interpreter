Testimony of Bill Nave, Healing Arts at The Haven

Committee on Health and Human Services 
 
My name is Bill Nave and I own Healing Arts at The Haven in Winthrop. I’m also a 
member of the Tobacco Free Maine Works business coalition. I support LD 1215 
because it’s an opportunity to meaningfully curb youth tobacco use and stave off 
tobacco’s negative consequences for families, communities, and businesses across the 
state. 
 
Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death and disease in Maine. Most 
people who use tobacco start at or before they turn 18 years old. A government study 
found that 81% of youth  who have ever used tobacco started with a flavored product [1].  
 
Flavored tobacco’s popularity among youth is consistent across product categories. A 
recent survey also shows that more than eight in ten current youth e-cigarette users 
vape flavored products, with fruit, candy and dessert flavored products as some of the 
most popular [2]. And according to the Food and Drug Administration , “youth smokers 
are more likely to use menthol cigarettes than any other age group”[3]. 
 
Tobacco addiction damages peoples’ health and well-being, and it’s an unnecessary 
strain on employers who already struggle to find reliable staff. Every year, smoking 
costs Maine nearly $1.5 billion due to associated health care expenses and lost 
productivity. 
 
I personally support ending the sale of flavored tobacco products in Maine because…  
My whole career I’ve worked with students from disadvantaged backgrounds who often 
had everything going against them. I was their advocate when others passed them over. I 
coaxed their faltering confidence back to life. Kids are capable of amazing growth given 
the right encouragement and environment. Allowing flavored tobacco to proliferate 
among youths is like dousing them in weed killer. Kids from disadvantaged backgrounds 
are already going through so much in their daily life. They don't need this looming 
temptation of flavored tobacco to mess up their lives even more. 
 
Just as my business is a haven for those seeking immersion in healing practices such as 
yoga, we need to do the same for Maine’s youth.
