I am the mother of two girls ages 4 and 6. My hope is that the sale of flavored tobacco
is retired in Maine so when my girls are in High School they can freely use that 
bathroom without worrying if there are other students in there vaping. Unlike today's 
students. With the ever rising health care costs that we all face any step we can make 
in decreasing the sale of carcinogenic and addictive substances feels like a win! As a 
small business owner I understand the need to meet bottom lines and one's need to 
provide for their families. I think the expectation should be anyone with the privilege 
of operating their own business must take on the social responsibility that what they 
are selling is not directly contributing to the deterioration of someone's health and 
livelihood. If businesses want to sell these products will they also help pay for their 
customers medical bills? The time has come for accountability and responsibility.
