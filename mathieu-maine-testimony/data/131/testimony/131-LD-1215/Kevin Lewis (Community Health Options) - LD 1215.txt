 
LD 1215: An Act To End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products 
Testimony of Kevin Lewis, President and CEO, Community Health Options  
April 25, 2023 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: 
 
My name is Kevin Lewis, I’m the President and CEO of Community Health Options and a 
partner of the Tobacco-Free Maine Works coalition. I’m testifying in favor of LD 1215, an Act 
to End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products.  
 
As Maine’s only nonprofit CO-OP health insurance company, we exist for the benefit of our 
Members.  Our mission is to provide affordable, high-quality benefits that promote health and 
wellbeing.  We provide comprehensive health insurance benefits to individuals, families, and 
businesses. We insure over a thousand businesses across Maine.  
 
Given our goal to promote health and wellbeing of our members and among Maine communities, 
our benefits include a focus on the reduction of tobacco use, a leading cause of preventable death 
and disease in Maine.  However, there’s also a business case for supporting these efforts. As a 
health insurer, we see businesses paying higher health care costs due to tobacco use among 
employees, which can put unnecessary strain on their bottom-lines. Altogether, smoking costs 
Maine $811 million annually in associated health care expenses [1].  
 
The best way to reduce tobacco use is to make sure kids never pick up the products in the first 
place because most tobacco users start young.  One in five Maine high school students are 
currently using a tobacco product [2], and young people often cite appealing flavors as a primary 
reason for using the products [3].  
 
It’s critical that Maine’s lawmakers end the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including 
flavored e-cigarettes, flavored cigars, and menthol cigarettes in order to reduce the burden of 
tobacco-related disease on Maine’s communities and businesses.  
 
I urge you to vote ought to pass on LD 1215.
