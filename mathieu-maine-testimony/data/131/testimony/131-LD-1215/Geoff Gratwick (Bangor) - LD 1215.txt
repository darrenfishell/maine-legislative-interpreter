LD 1215
Good Afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the HHS 
Committee, my once-upon-a-time colleagues. I am Geoff Gratwick MD, a now retired
physician from Bangor; I was an immunologist and rheumatologist. . 
I strongly urge you to pass LD 1215. I have too long seen the effects of nicotine 
addiction as a doctor, Mainer, and as a human being.  Nicotine is powerfully 
addicting; it is insidious, all pervasive, and all too often makes a mockery of our free 
will. We are after all biologic beings and chemicals have a profound effect on the 
physiologic pathways within us. Anything that makes cigarettes more attractive to 
young people, or old people for that matter, for the sake of financial profit for the few 
is wrong. LD 1215 is a step in the right direction.  
I have continued to be involved in public health since I retired from active medical 
practice and the legislature.  I have learned all over again something that I we all 
know intuitively: prevention is much less expensive and more satisfying than cure.  
The money we spend on oncologists, chest surgeons, and pulmonologists could be 
much better spent elsewhere. 
LD 1215 will save lives. Please pass it.  Thanks you, Geoff G
