I feel the sale of flavored tobacco is detrimental to our youth. My daughter who never 
so much as tried smoking, or any controlled substance felt that something called 
'cotton candy vaping pen' would be hazardous to her health. I am very involved in my 
daughters life and was SHOCKED to find that she had been vaping for over 5 
months. By the time I found out..she was basically addicted. We worked long and 
hard to have her 'kick' something that NEVER should have been started. She admits 
now..she never dreamed that something called 'cotton candy' would hurt her.
