LD 1215
Hello, I am a resident of Maine and mother to two school-age children.  I support 
LD1215 and banning the sale of flavored tobacco across the state.  I appreciate all 
efforts to curb the use of tobacco now that we are years into our understanding of the 
health affects and economic drain of its use. I do not want my children or their friends
to start using tobacco, and with this step they will be less tempted to try it. Thank you.
