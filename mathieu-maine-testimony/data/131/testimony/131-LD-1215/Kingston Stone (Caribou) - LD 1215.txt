Hi, my name is King and I go to school in Caribou. I see kids who are older than me 
but not old enough to smoke and vape use tobacco and I don't understand why it can 
be so easy for them. I don't want to be sick or addicted when I grow up so I avoid 
things like tobacco. But it seems like the older you get the harder it is to stay away 
from smokers.
I think it's not fair companies make things with flavors for kids. Tobacco just makes 
you sick, and everyone should have a fair chance to be healthy. Thank you for 
listening to me.
