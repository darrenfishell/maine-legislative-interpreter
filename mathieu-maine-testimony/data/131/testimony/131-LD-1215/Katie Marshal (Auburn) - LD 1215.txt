NO PLEASE NOT AGAIN! Vaping has helped me so much and I just started to 
decrease my nicotine mg just so I can have better flavor! I have been vaping for 2 
years, tried chewing the gum and I was allergic to the patch this is literally the only 
thing that has helped me not smoke cigarettes please don't ban my flavors!
