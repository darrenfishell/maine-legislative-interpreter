LD 1215: An Act To End the Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products

Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
My name is Amy Crowley, I’m co-owner of Chickadee Infant and Toddler Care in 
South Portland. I’m also a partner of Tobacco-Free Maine Works.  
As a parent, and someone who’s dedicated their professional life to caring for 
children, I’m writing in favor of LD 1215, an Act to End the Sale of Flavored 
Tobacco Products. It will help protect the health and future of our kids from the 
well-known harms of tobacco use. 
I also want to share how tobacco use affects our business. Our employment standards 
are stringent, and rightly so given that we care for other peoples’ children. We need 
reliable, healthy employees, and tobacco users are generally less healthy and miss 
more work compared to non-users. If we’re short staffed, we can’t stay open, which 
means other people have to miss work to keep their kids home. Those economic costs 
ripple far beyond our own business. 
The bottomline is that if we can keep kids from ever starting to use tobacco products, 
it will be a long term win for our communities and for businesses like ours. 
Please vote to pass on LD 1215. 
Sincerely, 
Amy Crowley
