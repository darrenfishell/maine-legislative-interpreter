I would like the committee to know that the state is going about the problem of under 
age smoking wrong! Stopping the sale of flavored products is putting the blame on 
the product and not the user. They will either shift to using non-flavored products of 
buy it on the black market. look what  happened when the government over stepped 
with alcohol and banned it. All that did was to make a whole new issue. It's time to 
make people responsible for there actions. We can do this with more education and 
enforce laws on minors and  individuals that purchase these items for the minors. 
Thank you for listening it's time we stand up a reduce government controls and 
making new laws that just  moved the issue from one to another.
