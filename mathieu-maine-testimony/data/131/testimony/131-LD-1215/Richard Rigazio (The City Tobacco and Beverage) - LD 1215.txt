Good afternoon , 
My name is Richard Rigazio and I am the owner of The City Tobacco and Beverage Center 
Located in Sanford Maine.   I am writing today in reference to the proposed flavor ban for the state of 
Maine.  
We have operated at our location for over 20 years.   We are a well-known  and often frequented 
business in the area.   At this time, a tobacco flavor ban would be detrimental to our business. It is 
currently all too easy for the people around us to travel 15 miles t o save money and buy their product in 
New Hampshire, as the cigarette tax rates are lower.   The number of customers we would lose to the 
nearby New Hampshire border due to a state wide flavor ban would greatly hurt our business.  
  
Thank you for your consid eration of business owners in this matter .
