I and many of my family members have been using flavored vapes to stop using 
cigarettes, i know a lot of people who use flavors to get away from tobacco as a 
whole, and it works. I agree on trying to stop kids from using these products but it 
should be focused on the parents and people buying them for minors, not punishing 
shops that ID and do it the right way, if adults can buy flavored alcohol and weed at 
every corner they should be able to buy flavored tobacco.
