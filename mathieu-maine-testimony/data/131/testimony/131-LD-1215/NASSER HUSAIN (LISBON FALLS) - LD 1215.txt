Hello,
I am a constituent of yours. I am writing today to urge you to vote NO on the flavored
tobacco ban.
As a Mainer, freedom of choice is one of the things I value the most. Banning adults 
from using products like wintergreen dip violates my freedom. 
History tells us that bans and prohibitions have unintended consequences that result in
selective enforcement and illicit markets. 
Stand up for Mainers and please vote no on any flavored tobacco ban!
