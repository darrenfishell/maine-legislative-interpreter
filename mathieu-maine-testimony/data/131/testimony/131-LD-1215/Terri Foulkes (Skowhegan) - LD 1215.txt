We have two small businesses in Skowhegan. All of our employees are trained to 
adhere to all policies and practices created by the state and tobacco companies to 
prevent any sales to minors, this includes carding and verification of age for all 
tobacco sales.
Creating a ban on all flavored tobacco will not end the consumption of these products.
It will in turn cause consumers to travel to other states or to participate in illegal 
activities in order to continue to obtain these products. Also, all of the revenue the 
state currently obtains from the sale of these products will follow the sales to other 
states causing a huge loss in revenue not only for the state but also for all businesses 
affected in this state. Sale of these products remaining in hands of the responsible 
retailers who are trained to provide only to those who are age 21 or over should be 
allowed to continue.   The ban is also not going to prevent minors from obtaining 
these products through less regulated sources. This ban is also an infringement on the 
choices of legal adults who have and will continue to smoke menthol products as they
have for many years. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
