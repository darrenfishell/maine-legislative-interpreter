As we all know our children spend a lot of time in our local schools. The role of the 
school has been to educate them with basic skills so they can succeed in life. 
Unfortunately, the schools are taking on a new role. The school want to be informed 
of anything medical happening with our students at home. The school nurse makes it 
very clear when students enroll that they want to know what’s going on. So why 
should the parent not be informed if something happens at school and there’s medical 
concerns?  The parents, the taxpayers, are financing the school 
department.  The reason kids under the age of 18 are called minors is a reason we all 
can understand. If they were adults, they wouldn’t need parents to take care of them 
but they’re not. Don’t take the role of the parent away from our kids.
