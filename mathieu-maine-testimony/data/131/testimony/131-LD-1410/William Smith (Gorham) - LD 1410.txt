Testimony for 1410 "An Act to Hold School Employees Civilly Liable for Failure to 
Notify Parents Regarding Medical Issues of Students Under 18 Years of Age" and LD
1809 "An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without Parental Consent"
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and distinguished members of the 
Committee on Judiciary.
My name is Bill Smith, I live in Gorham and I write to you today to ask that you vote 
“Shall Pass” on LD 1410 and LD 1809. 
The removal of a parent's right to act as primary counsel for care related to their child 
must not be infringed simply at the will of another regardless of whether or not that 
other is an employee of the state. 
The State must respect the right of due process under the law as described in the 5th 
amendment of the US Constitution even though the state has a strong interest in 
protecting the welfare of its children.
Sighted in the US Supreme Court [SCOTUS] review of Walter LITTLE, Appellant, v.
Gloria STREATER:
Due process, "unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed 
content unrelated to time, place and circumstances." Joint Anti-Facist Refugee 
Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 162, 71 S.Ct. 624, 643, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) 
(concurring opinion). Rather, it is "flexible and calls for such procedural protections 
as the particular situation demands." Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct.
2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). In Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 377, 91 
S.Ct. 780, 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), the Court held that "due process requires, at a 
minimum, that absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, 
persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process 
must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard." Accord, Armstrong v. Manzo, 
380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); Mullane v. Central 
Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656, 94 L.Ed. 865 
(1950). 
Similarly in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 
18 (1976), SCOTUS explained:
"[I]dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires 
consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected 
by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest 
through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute
procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function 
involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute 
procedural requirement would entail."
No employee of the State can simply decide to supersede the primary role of the 
parent as caregiver of their child.
Therefore I respectfully ask that you vote “Shall Pass” on both LD 1410 and LD 
1809.
Thank you for your time.
