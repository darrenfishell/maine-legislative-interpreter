LD 1410
Sen. Carney. Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee
Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony on LD 1410.
I do not have the time I need to give the reasons why I support this bill as I have an 
appointment to rush off to, but I read the bill and totally agree with it as it is written 
and urge you to vote "Ought to pass" on LD 1410.
Sincere thanks,
Judy Icenogle
