JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
May 5, 2023
' 
Senator Carney, Representat1ve Moonen, and d1st1ngu1shed members of the Jo1nt Standmg 
Commlttee on Jud1c1ary, greetlngs My name 1s Meagan Sway, and I am the Pol1cy D1rector at the 
ACLU of Ma1ne, a statew1de organ1zat1on comm1tted to advancmg and preservmg c1v1l rlghts and 
c1v1l l1bert1es guaranteed by the Ma1ne and U S Const1tut1ons I am here today to test1fy 1n 
oppos1t1on to LD 1410, wh1ch W111 make 1t harder for young people 1n Mame to access healthcare 
Th1s b1ll W111 lmpose pun1shment on people who help ensure that young people are able to 
access necessary healthcare serv1ces 
It 1s lmperatlve that all young people have access to necessary healthcare, 1t can be a matter 
of l1fe or death lnvolvmg parents m a young person’s health care dec1s10n 1s 1deal At the same 
tlme, not all young people 1n Ma1ne have healthy and safe fam1ly relatlonshlps In many cases, 
young people W111 not seek health care 1f they are requlred to lnvolve a parent or 1f therr 
conf1dent1al1ty 1s comprormsed Th1s 1s especlally true for sens1t1ve areas of care mental health, 
substance use, sexual health And unfortunately, these areas of care are often necessary to prevent 
long-term suffer1ng and death 
Unfortunately, access to healthcare by m1nors—part1cularly mmors who are trans gender- 
has become a tool of po11t1ca1 demagoguery There 1s, apparently, no l1m1t on the top1cs that some 
people W111 seek to explo1t for pol1t1cal galn Young people 1n need of medlcal care are the ones 
who end up pay1ng the pr1ce We urge you to I‘6_]6CIl these efforts, and to I'C_]6CI th1s b1ll as Well
