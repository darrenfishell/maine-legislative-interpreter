Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.  My name is Jon Schmidt, I am a resident of Bowdoin, and I am 
submitting this testimony to express my SUPPORT for LD 1410, An Act to Hold School 
Employees Civilly Liable for Failure to Notify Parents of Regarding Medical Issues of 
Students Under 18 Years of Age. 
Rules without enforcement and very clear consequences for violation are ineffectual. 
I support this bill because it adds teeth (i.e. legal consequences) to what should be bedrock 
policy:  school staff have no ethical justification for withholding medical information about 
minor students from the students’ parents and legal guardians.  The articulation of this 
principle in LD 1410 has been made necessary because of unfortunate real-life examples in 
Maine and elsewhere, where school staff have taken it upon themselves to supplant 
parental authority and withhold critical health information from students’ parents.   
This bill is an essential step in  legally codifying, restoring, and enforcing recognition and 
respect of parental rights and responsibilities to act in the best interests of their children.   
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS. Thank you.
