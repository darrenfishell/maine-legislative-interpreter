I am in favor of bill that holds schools liable when they do not notify of medical 
issues in children 18 and under. Parental rights are sacrosanct. The State is not the 
parent and cannot encroach on parental rights. As a school administrator, I have 
witnessed the damage that schools have done by providing “secret” support to their 
students. Very often these children are extremely vulnerable and the teachers, many 
but not all who are well-intentioned, provide access to medical treatments without 
informing parents. These adults set their students in opposition to their parents at a 
time when parental involvement is most needed. When the child graduates, these 
misguided teachers have set in motion actions that have lasting repercussions that 
unfold for years. Often these young people flounder alone and alienated by their 
families, who often find out about abortions or trans therapies long after the damage is
done. Medical issues that require outside professionals should also require parental 
involvement.
