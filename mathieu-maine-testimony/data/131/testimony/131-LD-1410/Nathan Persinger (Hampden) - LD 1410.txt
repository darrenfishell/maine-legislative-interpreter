LD 1410
Honorable Members of the Judiciary Committee
Please vote OUGHT TO PASS on LD 1410. It is absolutely necessary that 
parents/guardians of minors know everything that happens to their child at school. It 
is a sad indictment against our state and our nation that school officials believe it is 
permissible to withhold such information from parents. God gave kids to their parents
and ordained the parents to have sole responsibility for the welfare of their children, 
not the schools or the government. The schools have no right to exclude the parents 
from, nor influence, medical decisions made by minors.
