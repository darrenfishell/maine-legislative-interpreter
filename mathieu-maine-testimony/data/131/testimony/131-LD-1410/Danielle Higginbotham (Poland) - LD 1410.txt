LD 1410
Members of the Judiciary Committee,
I am writing to you today in opposition of LD 1410, An Act to Hold School 
Employees Civilly Liable for Failure to Notify Parents Regarding Medical Issues of 
Students Under 18 Years of Age. 
The vague language of this bill is concerning to me for a multitude of reasons. As a 
School Counselor, I assist students with mental health needs that arise at school. 
Mental health falls under the large undefined umbrella of ‘medical issues’ in this bill. 
We are already ethically obligated to reach out to parents/guardians to inform them of
concerns pertaining to their children. If school employees had to call home every time
a ‘medical issue’ arose, it would significantly impact the amount of students we 
would be able to assist each day. 
For example, a  School Nurse calling home every time a student came in for a band 
aid. That is a medical issue, but not an issue that requires a phone call home. As a 
Counselor, helping a student cope when they are worried about a friendship problem. 
This worry could be labeled a mental health concern but if it is a one time concern it 
might not warrant a call home. If it is an ongoing issue of anxiety that we are seeing at
school, that would definitely warrant contact home. 
Parental rights are incredibly important and I would never wish to dismiss parent or 
guardian concerns. Parental involvement is incredibly important to the overall 
well-being and success of our students. But this bill, while it may be well intended, 
covers a topic that we are already legally and ethically bound to follow up with. That 
is why I am submitting this testimony in opposition to LD 1410.
Sincerely,
Danielle Higginbotham
