LD 1410
Good afternoon! I would like to testify that I support LD 1410. Parents should not be 
excluded from any information regarding their children regardless of if the child 
doesn't want to share that information with their parents. It is the right of a parent to 
not have secrets held from them about their children. Children who disagree with their
parents about issues, for example transgenderism, are still under the authority of their 
parents. Parents need to be respected for the authority they have in their own home. 
Regardless of the issues that the child may not want the parents to know about, it is 
the right of the parents to be told.
