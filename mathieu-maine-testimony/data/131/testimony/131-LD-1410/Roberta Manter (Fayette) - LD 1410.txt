LD 1410
I am horrified that LD 1419 and LD 1809 are even necessary, but I am convinced that
they are.  Without these bills, a male teacher can rape a minor student, then when she 
becomes pregnant, whisk her off to an abortion clinic without the parents even being 
notified.  Are our laws supposed to protect the rapist, or the innocent child?
Without these bills, a school can take a student for surgery and then send that student 
home without the parents knowing that their child has just had surgery and needs to 
be monitored for possible post-surgical complications that could lead to death.
Without these bills, a child could be taken for irreversible surgeries such as sex 
change surgeries without the parents' knowledge or consent.
Science has shown that the human brain is not fully developed until somewhere after 
twenty years of age.  A child whose brain is not fully developed cannot be expected to
make life decisions that are best for them.  Neither can school employees make the 
best decision for a child who is not their own child.  Only the parents know the 
history and current events in the life of that child that are relevant to that child's 
medical issues.  Similarly, the medical professionals to whom the school employees 
take that child may not be that family's doctor who is familiar with that child's 
medical history and family situation.  And neither school employees nor medical 
professionals have the lifelong commitment to a child that a parent does.
Before voting on these two bills, please ask yourself:  If this were my daughter and a 
teacher raped her, would I want that teacher to be able to take my daughter for an 
abortion so I would never know about the rape?  Or would I want that to happen to 
my neighbor's daughter so that that teacher could continue his behavior undetected, 
and perhaps my daughter would be next?  Please vote LD 1410 and LD 1809 Ought 
to Pass.
