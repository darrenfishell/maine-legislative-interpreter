To: The Judiciary Committee 
 
I am writing to strongly urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1410 for the 
following reasons: 
1. The parents and only the parents have the right to determine any health 
care procedures to be performed on their children. 
2. If someone violates this law, then penalties must be imposed! 
 
I strongly urge you to vote “ought to pass” on LD1410!
