Christian Civic League of Maine 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Maine Committee 
on Judiciary, I am Mike McClellan, Policy Director for the Christian Civic League of 
Maine. The Christian Civic League of Maine envisions a state and nation where 
God is honored, religious freedom flourishes, families thrive, and life is cherished. 
We believe a Biblical approach works in life and including in governance. 
I am here to testify on LD 1410 An Act to Prohibit Health Care Services Without 
Parental Consent sponsored by Representative Hymes of Waldo. 
This bill prohibits public and private schools from withholding from a minor 
student's parent or encouraging a minor student to withhold from the student's 
parent medical information related to the student or conversations with the 
student related to medical issues. As I read the intent of the bill, I am taken back 
that this is a conversation we need to have. 
 
Parental involvement is a key to the success of the school experience and of 
course, the child. It is easy to document the value of a collaboration between the 
various school players and the family, the parents. My understanding is that this 
bill seeks to both promote partnerships and hold partners responsible. LD 1410 
would thus, hold the school or their agents to be financially responsible for 
actions that are done in a vacuum or without the parentâ€™s permission. 
 
LD 1410 is a commonsense piece of legislation that looks to ensure the balance of 
parental support, engagement and collaboration. Please support parents and 
families. Vote to support LD 1410. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration today.
