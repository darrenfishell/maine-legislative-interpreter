 
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on the 
Judiciary, my name is Nicole Clegg, I serve as the Interim CEO at Planned Parenthood of 
Northern New England and I am here today to submit testimony in opposition to LD 1410. 
 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England provides comprehensive reproductive and 
sexual health care to more than 14,000 people in Maine at four health centers located in 
Biddeford, Portland, Sanford and Topsham. People turn to us for affordable, high-quality care 
including wellness exams, birth control, disease testing and treatment, cancer screenings, 
abortion care as well as a variety of primary care services. We see everyone who comes to us 
regardless of ability to pay, and in a typical year, we provide more than $4 million in free and 
discounted care to our communities in Maine.   
 
As a mission driven health care provider, we fundamentally believe everyone should be able to 
get affordable, high quality sexual and reproductive health care in their communities, no matter 
where they live or how much money they make, and we advocate for policies that help make 
this vision a reality.   
 
By forcing schools to disclose students' medical discussions with staff to their parents, LD 1410 
undermines minors’ ability to make their own medical decisions and seek safe unbiased medical 
information and treatment. There is clear medical consensus on minor’s consent for certain 
types of healthcare with the American Medical Association, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, the Society for Adolescent 
Medicine, and the American Public Health Association all in agreement that minors need to be 
able to consent for certain types of healthcare including mental health, substance use, birth 
control and sexual and reproductive health care. Healthcare providers know the impact of 
parental notification requirements for minors seeking health care– in study after study, 
parental notification requirements lessen trust and decrease the likelihood of adolescents 

seeking the care they need in areas ranging from mental health care1 to substance abuse 
support2 to STI testing and treatment3.  
 
While it is preferable for young people to discuss their health care options with trusted family 
members or guardians this relationship does not always exist, using the power of the state to 
mandate parental involvement in the absence of this trust is something that is likely to result in 
teens avoiding discussions altogether.  We want young people to have health care, information 
and resources, not barriers and delays. We want them to have the support and resources to 
make important decisions that are best for their health, lives and future opportunities and to be 
able to decide who to seek out for support and guidance to be safe, healthy, and affirmed. It is 
for all these reasons that I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1410.
