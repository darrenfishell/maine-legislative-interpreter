Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
498:
“An
Act
to
Prohibit
the
Use
of
the
Electronic
Benefits
Transfer
System
Outside
of
Maine,
Massachusetts
or
New
Hampshire
to
Obtain
Temporary
Assistance
for
Needy
Families
Program
Benefits”
Senator
Baldacci,
Representative
Meyer,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Health
and
Human
Services,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
498.
The
programs
which
utilize
EBT
should
be
held
to
the
highest
standards
of
accountability,
not
only
because
they
are
funded
by
those
who
work,
but
because
their
intent
is
to
feed
the
hungry
and
clothe
the
bare.
LD
498
would
provide
Maine
taxpayers
greater
assurance
that
recipients
of
public
assistance
are
not
abusing
a
system
meant
to
provide
the
essentials
for
those
who
are
struggling.
It
is
not
fair
to
the
taxpayer
that
their
funds
may
be
spent
outside
of
Maine
or
our
close
neighbors.
Those
funds,
since
they
were
taken
from
Mainers,
should
stay
close.
This
bill
is
basic
due
diligence
for
legislators,
those
tasked
with
accountability
and
oversight
of
taxpayer
dollars.
The
Legislature
should
work
to
provide
stronger
safeguards
against
inappropriate
use
of
EBT
cards
and
public
assistance
broadly.
Please
deem
LD
498
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
contribute
to
a
more
fair
and
transparent
welfare
system
to
serve
Mainers
who
need
it
most.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
