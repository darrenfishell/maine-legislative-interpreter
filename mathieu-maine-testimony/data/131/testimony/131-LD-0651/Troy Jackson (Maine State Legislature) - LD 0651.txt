Testimony in Support of LD 651 
An Act to Amend the Standards for Manufactured Housing to Comply with United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development Standards 
Presented to the loint Standing Committee on Labor and Housing 
Thursday, April 6, 2023 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor 
and Housing, my name is Troy Jackson. l serve as President of the Maine Senate and proudly 
represent Aroostook County in the Legislature. I am here today to present LD 651, "An Act to 
Amend the Standards for Manufactured Housing to Comply with United States Department of 
Housing and Urban Development Standards." 
This is a simple but important bill. LD 651 would amend current Maine law to bring it into 
compliance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's deﬁnition of 
"manufactured homes." The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 24, Part 3280.2, which covers HUD, 
was recently updated. It states that a manufactured home “means a structure, transportable in one 
or more sections, which in the traveling mode is Q body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or 
more in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet." 
Compliance with HUD is essential because HUD administers many programs that beneﬁt Mainers, 
such as mortgage and loan insurance, Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment 
Partnership block grants, and rental assistance. The Compliance Division of HUD processes 
suspensions and debarments against its business partners who do not comply. The sanctions may 
result in the exclusion of the business from further participation in HUD and other Federal Branch 
procurement programs. Therefore, in order to support Maine's housing needs, the deﬁnition of 
“manufactured housing" needs to be updated for clarity and compliance. 
For these reasons, I ask for your support of LD 651. Thank you for your time.
