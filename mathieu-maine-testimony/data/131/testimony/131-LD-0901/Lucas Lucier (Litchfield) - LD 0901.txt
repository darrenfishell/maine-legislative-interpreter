LD 901
My name is Lucas Lucier.  My partner, Becky Deering and I, own Tiny Roots 
Organic Farm in Litchfield, Maine.  We grow mixed vegetables and herbs, which we 
sell at farmers markets in Kittery and Kennebunk.  2023 will be our fourth season of 
farming.  We are getting to the point where we would like to train an apprentice in the
next few years but our budget restraints may restrict us from doing so.  LD 901 would
be a huge help in allowing us to offer a paid apprenticeship position on our farm.  
This bill would help make an apprenticeship position feasible for our farm and any 
future apprentices.
