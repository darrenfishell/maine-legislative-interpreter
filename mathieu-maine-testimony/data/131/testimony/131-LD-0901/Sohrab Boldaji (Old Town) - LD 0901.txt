As a former farm apprentice, it is in my opinion that this bill is crucial for creating 
future farmers in Maine. The current system that exists to aid farmers rely solely on 
the apprentices, who are often young and have little to no incentive for getting the 
required paperwork done. This bill creates a meaningful way to support farmers in 
training the future farmers of Maine, and it is my opinion that it should be supported 
by all.
