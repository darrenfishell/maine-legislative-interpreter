Hello! My name is Matt, Iâ€™m 23 years old and I currently work at and live on a farm 
in Rockport, Maine as the Program Manager. I have worked at Maine farms as an 
hourly worker and as a MOFGA apprentice in the past. I am actively considering a 
future in Maine farming, which I would not be able to do had I not had access to the 
mentorship and education that I have been lucky enough to receive. Additionally, I 
would not have come to work in farming in the first place without the provided 
housing that came and still comes from these jobs. I was seeking a job that provided 
housing because I was concerned about my ability to pay for housing in Maine after 
graduating from college, and I was extremely lucky to stumble upon and fall in love 
with farming. I have learned so much from working on these small, organic farms, 
and I finally feel like I have a sense of purpose and a place to call home.
