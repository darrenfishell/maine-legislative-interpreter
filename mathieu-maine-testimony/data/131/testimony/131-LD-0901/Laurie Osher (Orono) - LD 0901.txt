in

Before
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
fellow
members
of
the
Agriculture,

and
Forestry
Committee.
I
am
Laurie
Osher
and
I
represent
District
25,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
introduce
and
express
my
support
for
LD
901:
Resolve,
to
Establish
a
Pilot
Pr oject
to
Support
Farm
Appr enticeships
in
Maine.
There
are
approximately
7,600
farms
across
Maine.
Median
farm
size
is
67
acres
and
the
majority
of
farms
are
operated
by
sole
proprietors
on
less
than
fifty
acres.
The
average
age
of
Maine
farmers
is
57
years
old,
and
is
increasing
each
year.
From
the
most
recent
(2017)
Maine
Ag
Census,
we
know
that
the
number
of
farmers
age
65
and
older
increased
by
30
%,
signaling
an
urgent
need
for
succession
and
retirement
planning.
One
way
to
assist
with
succession
planning
is
for
farmers
to
train
apprentices.
This
bill
proposes
a
pilot
project
to
support
farm
apprenticeships
in
Maine.
For
people
interested
in
becoming
farmers,
working
as
seasonal
farmworkers
is
a
good
first
step.
The
next
step
in
workforce
training
in
other
fields
is
an
apprenticeship
program.
The
Maine
Organic
Farmers
and
Gardeners
Association
has
an
apprenticeship
program
that
is
not
associated
with
any
state
or
federal
government
program.
Their
website
describes
the
program
this
way:
“MOFGA ’s
Apprenticeship
Program
is
targeted
for
young
adults,
with
or
without
previous
farming
experience,
but
all
are
welcome
to
apply .
Apprenticeships
may
begin
any
time
during
the
year,
and
last
for
any
duration,
but
most
farmers
are
looking
for
apprentices
who
will
commit
for
the
entire
growing
season
(early
March
through
late
October).
The
usual
apprenticeship
is
an
immersive
practicum
involving
labor
in
return
for
room
and
board,
instruction,
financial
compensation
and
experience.”

This
bill
was
proposed
by
Lucie
Nolden,
a
Maine
college
student
who
participated
in
the
MOFGA
apprenticeship
program
for
two
summers.
In
comparing
her
experiences
with
other
apprentices,
she
learned
that
there
was
a
wide
range
of
definitions
to
room:
from
a
place
to
pitch
a
tent
to
an
apartment
with
electricity ,
running
water ,
and
heat;
and
a
wide
range
of
financial
compensation
and
mentoring.
She
developed
the
language
of
this
bill
by
working
with
staff
of
MOFGA
and
Maine
Farmland
Trust
and
in
conjunction
with
legislators
and
representatives
of
DACF .
This
bill
seeks
to
create
a
pilot
farm
apprenticeship
program
where
farmers
can
mentor
and
train
future
farmers
who
will
gain
the
skills
to
either
start
their
own
farms
or
partner
with
older
farmers
who
are
developing
succession
plans.
This
proposed
pilot
program
will
provide
$5,000
grants
to
Maine
farmers
to
support
the
costs
of
mentoring
an
apprentice.
Mentors
can
apply
for
up
to
two
of
these
grants
per
year.
The
money
can
be
used
to
offset
the
cost
of
labor ,
housing
or
other
associated
expenses.
The
minimum
apprenticeship
period
is
three
months,
and
during
that
time,
apprentices
must
be
paid
minimum
wage
for
40
hours
per
week.
The
proposed
pilot
project
would
be
administered
by
the
Department
of
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry .
The
$125,000
amount
presented
in
the
bill
would
cover
the
cost
of
twenty-five
apprentices.
The
pilot
project
will
enable
farmers
to
train
individuals
who
are
ready
to
increase
their
knowledge
and
skills
beyond
what
they
have
learned
as
entry
level
farmworkers.
This
is
a
targeted
workforce
development
investment
specifically
designed
for
Maine
farms
by
those
who
know
what
Maine
farmers
and
future
farmers
need.
Carolyn
Sachs,
Ph.D.,
Penn
State
Professor
Emerita
of
Rural
Sociology
described
the
challenges
of
being
a
farmer
this
way:
“Being
a
farmer ,
you
have
to
be
everything.
You
have
to
be
able
to
be
the
marketing
manager ,
the
distribution
manager ,
the
accountant,
the
bookkeeper ,
and
the
mechanic.
You
have
so
many
hats
to
wear .
It
is
very
challenging,
and
it
also
uses
your
whole
self.
You
have
to
make
decisions
all
of
the
time
that
involve
ecological
concepts
and
financial
concepts
and
mechanical
concepts
and
integrate
all
of
it.”
This
pilot
project
is
designed
to
help
a
future
farmer
gain
the
experience
that
will
help
them
be
more
prepared
to
move
into
the
role
of
a
farmer .
LD
901
will
provide
financial
support
for
farmers
who
take
on
the
role
of
mentor .
I
urge
you
to
vote
Ought
to
Pass.
