Honorable members of the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee: 
I am not a farmer but a simple resident of the greater Portland area. I make a strong 
effort to buy from Maine farmers and have a great desire to have our food produced 
here in Maineâ€”not trucked from thousands of miles away. Anything we can do such 
as this program to encourage more farmers and preserve farmland has my full 
support.
