LD 901
I am writing in support of LD 901. I am a college student in Maine, and I have 
worked on multiple farms, in Maine and the Northeast, as an intern, apprentice, and 
volunteer. I believe that introducing young people to sustainable agriculture is of 
critical importance as we face a future of climate uncertainty in Maine. In order to 
support a future for local food and regenerative farming in Maine, we must support 
the education of bright young farmers by offering farms grant support for 
compensating apprentices. 
In my experience working on farms, many interns were making financial sacrifices in 
order to spend time working and learning on regenerative farms. Farm 
apprenticeships are often financially precarious and are not currently a feasible option
for college graduates with debt or loans. Offering funding support for farm 
apprenticeships would greatly expand the learning opportunities available in 
regenerative farming and make such experiences accessible to young folks without a 
financial safety net who require a living wage to support themselves, thus diversifying
our agricultural workforce. 
Again, I highly encourage the committee to support this bill. The future of Maineâ€™s 
food supply relies on supporting the development of a young workforce educated in 
sustainable and regenerative agriculture.
