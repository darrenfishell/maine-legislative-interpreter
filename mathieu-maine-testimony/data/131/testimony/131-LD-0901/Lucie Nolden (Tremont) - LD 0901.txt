Resolve,
to
Establish
a
Pilot
Project
to
Support
Farm
Apprenticeships
in
Maine
Senator
Ingwerson,
Representative
Pluecker ,
and
the
honorable
members
of
the
Committee
on
Agriculture,
Conservation,
and
Forestry ,
my
name
is
Lucie
Nolden.
I
live
in
T remont,
Maine
and
I
am
writing
in
favor
of
L.D.
901.
I
wrote
this
bill
with
the
help
of
friends
and
mentors
like
Jo
Burdett
because
I
saw
a
problem,
a
big
one,
and
I
saw
a
solution
for
the
problem.
For
many
decades
federal
subsidies
have
supported
the
industrialization
and
delocalization
of
agriculture.
Farms
have
gotten
much
lar ger ,
and
fewer
and
fewer
people
are
farmers.
The
average
age
of
farmers
has
been
rising,
our
food
has
gotten
more
and
more
processed
and
is
grown
further
and
further
away ,
and
not
only
have
we
gotten
more
and
more
disconnected
from
the
food
we
eat,
but
our
food
system
has
become
more
and
more
vulnerable
to
collapse.
W ith
inflation
and
rising
fuel
prices,
food
is
more
expensive
than
ever .
As
a
state,
Maine
imports
90%
of
the
food
we
eat,
even
though
farmers
in
the
state
produce
more
than
enough
calories
to
feed
all
Mainers.
This
becomes
an
even
bigger
problem
as
fuel
prices
continue
to
rise
and
climate
change
threatens
the
breadbaskets
of
the
country
and
of
the
world.
What
will
we
do
if
a
major
drought
hits
the
west
and
fuel
prices
remain
high?
How
will
Mainers
af ford
food
and
where
will
it
come
from?
A
strong
and
resilient
state
economy
starts
with
a
diverse
and
well-supported
network
of
local
producers.
Farming
in
Maine
has
a
rich
history ,
and
we
can
proudly
say
we
have
plenty
of
innovative
farmers
and
producers
leading
the
way ,
in
both
the
state
and
in
the
country ,
towards
this
vision.
V isionaries
in
four
season
farming,
no-till
farming,
and
local
grain
economies
have
blazed
paths
forward
here
in
Maine.
And
hundreds
of
incredible
farmers,
like
my
mentors
Jo
and
Jarrett
at
Moodytown,
have
made
it
their
mission
to
produce
healthy
and
delicious
food
for
their
communities
while
doing
so
in
a
sustainable
way ,
a
way
that
can
be
practiced
for
decades
or
centuries
without
depleting
the
soil
of
essential
nutrients
or
diminishing
biodiversity .
These
farmers,
with
their
many
combined
years
of
experience,
are
feeding
Maine.
And
we
need
to
support
them
in
transferring
their
wisdom
to
the
next
generation
of
farmers.
Through
decently
paid
work
with
an
emphasis
on
training,
farm
apprentices
can
and
have
been
learning
how
to
put
carbon
back
into
the
soil,
bring
heritage
species
of
fruits
and
vegetables,
grains,
and
animals
back
into
the
fold,
and
support
local
food
systems.
But
it
is
important
that
these
apprentices
should
receive
a
fair
wage
for
their
hard
labor ,
which
is
often
physically
dif ficult,
but
can
also
be
cognitively
challenging.
Farm
work
is
perhaps
the
most
underappreciated
and
undercompensated
form
of
labor ,
and
as
a
society
we
have
sort
of
accepted
that
farm
work
must
require
working
extremely
long
hours,
every
day ,
for
very
low
pay .
Agricultural
workers
are
one
of
the
few
exemptions
from
Maine’ s
state
minimum
wage.
It
is
insane
to
me
that
we
continue
to
accept
this
status
quo
as
normal.
W e
cannot
survive
without
farmers,
and
yet
we
continue
to
underappreciate
the
work
they
do.
I
see
this
bill
as
an
opportunity
to
envision
a
dif ferent
way
that
our
local
food
economies
could
look,
nationally
and
statewide.
This
is
a
pilot
program
to
test
out
what
could
happen
if
we
give
farmers
and
farm
workers
the
resources
they
need
to
not
just
survive,
but
thrive.
W e
can
keep
it
small,
test
it
out,
and
fix
any
kinks.
Maine
is
already
a
leader
in
strong
local
food
economies,
and
with
this
bill,
we
can
become
trailblazers,
striking
a
path
forwards
for
the
nation
to
follow .
I
wrote
this
bill
lar gely
by
myself,
and
I’ve
never
written
a
bill
before.
I
am
literally
22
years
old.
I
had
the
help
of
several
amazing
people
who
of fered
their
advice
and
expertise
to
help
shape
the
language,
but
I
don’ t
think
this
version
has
to
be
the
final
form.
I
would
like
to
hear
discussion
and
debate
around
sections
like
the
housing
requirement,
data
collection
for
review
of
the
pilot
program,
and
the
requirements
for
farm
eligibility .
It
would
be
incredible
if
this
bill
passed,
but
it
would
also
be
amazing
if
this
bill
sparked
a
conversation
about
creative,
out-of-the-box
ways
we
can
support
a
more
resilient
and
strong
local
foods
economy .
