Vice President 
Maine Energy Marketers Association 
 
 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON  
TRANSPORTATION 
In Support of LD 1017 
Resolve, to Increase Commercial Driver's License Examiner Capacity 
 
Senator Chipman, Representative William, and members of the Transportation Committee, my name is 
Megan Diver, I am the Vice President of the Maine Energy Marketers Association (MEMA). 
 
MEMA is a trade association composed of approximately 300-member companies and over 5,000 direct 
and 5,000 indirect people working in energy delivery and servicing businesses delivering heating oil, 
biofuels, motor fuels, propane, pellets and kerosene and offering service and installations on the 
equipment that operates these fuels.  MEMA also provides heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and 
refrigeration (HVAC-R), education and training to hundreds of Mainers each year at our Technical 
Education Center (MTEC) training facility located in Brunswick. 
 
I am here today to submit testimony in support of LD 1017.  
 
There is a great need to increase the number of examiner proctors to give the commercial driver’s 
license exam and to increase the commercial driver’s license examiner staff to conduct road evaluations. 
There has been a driver shortage for several years that slows down employment start dates and has 
created difficulty across many industries that rely on employees to hold a CDL driver’s license. We hear 
complaints from member often about the delay it takes to hear back about a testing date and then the 
date is somewhere between two and four weeks after that, sometimes as far out as six weeks.  
 
We appreciate the attention to this matter and resources that are being put forward to address the 
issues and concerns. We urge the Committee to vote in favor of LD 1017.  Thank you.
