Testimony of Victoria Foley 
Neither for nor against LD 666 
An Act to Support Community-based Volunteer Organizations 
Good moming, Senator Curry, Representative Roberts and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Imiovation, Development, Economic Advancement and Business. My name is 
Victoria Foley and I am the Legislative Affairs and Communications Liaison for the Department 
of Economic and Community Development. I am here today to testify neither for nor against LD 
666 An Act to Support Community~based Volunteer Organizations. 
The Department does not currently provide direct technical support to businesses or 
nonprofit organizations in their start-up phase. Instead, our team works to connect these groups to 
resources that already exist in the community to assist: places like the Small Business 
Development Centers (SBDCs) and SCORE. 
DECD also administers pass-through funding from the Legislature to SBDCs each year in 
the amount of $700,000 for the purpose of supporting small business founders and owners. 
For individuals interesting in starting a nonprofit in our state, the Maine Association of 
Nonprofits has an online resource available. 
That said, the Department appreciates the challenge of addinga program that is outside our 
current realm of expertise. We are happy to work with the bill sponsor to find creative solutionsâ€” 
which could include things like pass-through funding as we do for SBDC, or online tools to 
connect individuals who are interested in starting a volunteer-based nonprofit with information 
about the steps to take. 
This concludes my testimony and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
