AN ACT TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO 
PAY FOR CERTAIN WATER TESTS FOR PERFLUOROALKYL AND‘

PRESENTED BY SENATOR JAMES LIBBY 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
DATE OF HEARING: 
February 15, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee, l am Brian 
Kavanah, Director of the Bureau of Water Quality at the Department of Environmental 
Protection. I am speaking in opposition to L.D. 188. 
In the last session, the legislature passed L.D. 1911, An Act to Prevent the Further 
Contamination of the Soils and Waters of the State with So-called Forever Chemicals. 
That bill was thoroughly discussed by this committee. The bill was later signed by the 
Governor as P.L. 2021, c. 641, and became effective in August of 2022. Chapter 641 
addressed a variety of PFAS issues including the management of wastewater sludge 
and the management of septage. It also provided authority for the Department to 
require licensed dischargers of wastewater to test their wastewater effluent for PFAS 
and to report the results to the Department.

L.D. 188 - An Act to Require the DEP to Pay for Certain Water Tests for PFAS Substances

ln September of 2022 the Department notified 105 Publicly Owned Treatment Works 
(POTWs) and 19 industrial and commercial facilities that they were required to test for 
PFAS. The speciﬁed sampling protocol was one sample a month for 10 months. 
The cost of testing for the POT\/Vs is beingcovered by the Department using Maine’ 
Recovery and Jobs Plan funds that were provided to the Department for POTVV issues. 
Due to federal requirements these funds can not be used to pay for testing at industrial 
or commercial facilities. The 19 industrial commercial facilities that are sampling are 
primarily large manufactures such as papermills, BIW, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and 
others. However, the few commercial facilities include two car washes that discharge 
their treated wastewater to subsurface systems. l’ll focus on the car washes asl 
believe this is the main concern of LD 188. 
The Department is aware of the potential hardship the cost of this testing may cause 
some privately owned entities particularly a relatively small business such as a car 
wash. Car washes that are not on public sewer are licensed by the Department to 
discharge treated wastewater to a subsurface disposal system if certain conditions are 
met. The literature on PFAS indicated car washes could be a source of PFAS therefor 
the Department opted to include these systems for testing. 
After the sampling notiﬁcation letter was mailed in September, we had an inquiry froma 
former Senator on behalf of a constituent regarding the potential hardship of testing 
costs. We responded that given that car washes have been determined in other states, 
to be a source of PFAS, and that car washes that are discharging wastewater viaa 
subsurface system may contaminate groundwater, the Department believes it is 
appropriate for the facility to sample its wastewater for PFAS. However, we had noted 
in our sampling notification letter, the Department may reduce the frequency based on 
the results of the testing. If the results indicate a facility is not a source of PFAS'at 
levels that could contaminate groundwater the total number of samples required maybe

reduced once the discharge is adequately characterized. A reduction in the number of 
samples would reduce the overall cost to the facility. 
And in fact, we have already done that for one car wash based on their first sample that 
was relatively low. At their request, we reduced the sampling to quarterly with the 
caveat that this will be reevaluated as new data is generated. lf the results remain low 
the testing frequency will remain reduced. lf the results show higher levels the 
frequency may increase again. The other car wash has had a delay in submitting their 
data due to some issues outside their control. But if their data is also low, we would be 
able to similarly reduce their frequency. 
After this sampling project is completed, we will have a good sense of the levels of PFAS in 
various tryps of efﬂuent. This will infonn decisions on if and how PFAS should be controlled in 
wastewater discharges. It should be noted there are approximately 360 licensed point source 
discharges in Maine. All those licenses have various requirements for sampling of efﬂuent fora 
variety of potential contaminants. All these costs have always been the responsibility of the 
discharger. If needed, PFAS sampling and limits will become a normal part of certain waste 
discharge licenses and those costs will be the responsibility of the discharger. To require the 
Department to fund these costs would be a signiﬁcant shift in the regulatory structure for 
licensed discharges, it would require a signiﬁcant source of new funding, and it would raisea 
variety of logistical issues to coordinate payment for these tests on an ongoing basis. 
ln closing, the Department believes the procedures we have in place to adjust testing 
frequencies are reasonable and can alleviate some of the financial impact to the 
commercial dischargers. 
l would be happy to answerany questions you have, now, or at the work session. 
Thank you.
