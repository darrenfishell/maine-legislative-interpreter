To:Members of the Joint Committee on Environmentand Natural ResourcesFrom:Ania Wright, Political and Legislative SpecialistDate:February 15, 2023Re:Testimony inOpposition to L.D. 188:An Act toRequire the Department ofEnvironmental Protection to Pay for Certain Water Tests for Perfluoroalkyl and PolyfluoroalkylSubstances;
 Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and the members of the Joint Committee onEnvironment and Natural Resources,
I am testifying today on behalf of Sierra Club Maine, representing over 22,000 supporters andmembers statewide. Founded in 1892, Sierra Club is one of our nation’s oldest and largestenvironmental organizations. We work diligently to amplify the power of our 3.8 million membersnation-wide as we work towards combating climate change and promoting a just and sustainableeconomy. To that end, we urge an “ought not to pass” report on L.D. 188:An Act to Require theDepartment of Environmental Protection to Pay for Certain Water Tests for Perfluoroalkyl andPolyfluoroalkyl Substances.
We oppose this bill because it creates government responsibility for private entity actions. Lastlegislative session, the Legislature passed LD 1911, which “require(s) a person licensed by thedepartment to discharge wastewater to groundwater or any waters of the State to sample theeffluent discharged for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and to report the sample datato the department”. The state is currently able to support 105 Publicly Owned Treatment Facilities(POTWs) using Maine Jobs and Recovery Funds. The funds are not applicable to industry ownedtreatment facilities.
The state continues to spend millions of dollars to address the PFAS crisis, but it is vital toremember that this crisis did not come from the state. It came from private industries that continueto advocate that they should not be held financially responsible. Passing L.D. 188, would set aprecedent that the State should bear the financial burden of a crisis caused by industry. To that end,we urge the committee to unanimously oppose LD 188.
Sincerely,Ania Wright--Political and Legislative SpecialistSierra Club Maine Chapter
