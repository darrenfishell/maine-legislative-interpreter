Good afternoon Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. Myname is Ann Danforth and I use she/her pronouns. I’m a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofitlegal aid provider working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support of LD 287, An Act to Support Parents byProviding a Sales Tax Exemption for Diapers.
Families in Maine are struggling
Maine Equal Justice has seen first-hand that families across the state, and in particular, families with lowincome, are still suffering from the economic impacts of the pandemic. According to the most recentCensus data, more than 1 in 10 (11.5%) Mainers were in poverty in 20211– that is, a family of four livingbelow $27,479 annually.2That’s a little over $500a week.
Record high inflation coupled with high energy costs, a pre-existing and worsening housing crisis, risingfood costs coupled with the imminent loss of SNAP emergency allotments, and the upcoming unwindingof continuous enrollment for MaineCare members are huge factors stretching Maine families and theirbudgets.34
People should not have to choose between food, rent, and other basic necessities like diapers
Diapers typically cost families up to $100 per month per child.5Access to diapers is critical for childandmaternal health as well as parent’s ability to work. According to the Center on Budget and PolicyPriorities:

●Families facing financial challenges may keep diapers on for too long or empty solids and reusedisposable diapers, resulting in rashes, urinary tract infections, or worse.6
●Many child care providers require parents to provide diapers each day. At one diaper bank, 56percent of parents who needed child care to go to work reported missing work because theylacked diapers.7
●Diaper need has implications for maternal health as as well – one study of 296 low-incomewomen found a correlation between diaper need and maternal depression.8A study by YaleUniversity researchers concluded that an adequate supply of diapers could reduce parentingstress.9
For many low-income families, disposable diapers are the only option because they have limited accessto laundry facilities to use cloth diapers.
The high cost of diapers often falls hardest on mothers, who are more likely to be caring for youngchildren. Inflation has only made diapers even more expensive, with demand at diaper banks increasingsince the start of the pandemic.10
Furthermore, many public benefits designed to help low income mothers, like SNAP and WIC, do notcover the cost of diapers.
Maine can adopt tax policies that can help ease this burden on low income families
Maine’s tax code distinguishes between taxable items and non-taxable necessities like groceries andmedical supplies. One of the policy principles underlying this differentiation is that there are somepurchases that people must make to stay healthy.Recognizingthat sales tax is regressive in that it takes alarger percentage of income from low-income taxpayers than from high-income taxpayers, many statesexempt certain products from sales tax.We believethis same principle should apply to the taxation ofdiapers, as was recently applied to menstrual products following the same rationale. Maine has theopportunity to join states such as Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland,Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and more, to get rid of the state salestax on diapers.11
Conclusion
We appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony in support of LD 287.Thank you, and please feel freeto reach out to me with any questions or concerns.
