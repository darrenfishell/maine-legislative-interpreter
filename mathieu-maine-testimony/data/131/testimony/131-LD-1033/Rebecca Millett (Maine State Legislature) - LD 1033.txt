Testimony of Rep. Rebecca Millett presenting 
LD 1033, An Act Regarding the Issuing of Diplomas for Students at 
the Long Creek Youth Development Center 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Aﬂairs 
Good afternoon, Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and esteemed members of the 
Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. My name is Rebecca Millett, and I represent House 
District 123, most of Cape Elizabeth. I am before you presenting LD 1033, An Act Regarding 
the Issuing of Diplomas for Students at the Long Creek Youth Development Center. 
This bill originated from a question that arose aseto whether older students attending the Arthur 
R. Gould” School at Long Creek have the option to obtain a degree from their home district or 
from the state. The department has conﬁrmed that statute allows for both options, but it appears’ 
that not all districts are aware of these pathways. ~ 
The draft amendment language provides a resolve that directs the Maine Department of 
Education to create guidance for Maine school superintendents, principals, guidance counselors 
and the A.R. Gould School to inform them of diploma choices for students residing at the Long 
Creek Youth Development Center, attending the Arthur R. Gould*School and who are preparing 
to graduate. This will ensure consistency of understanding across districts, administrations, and 
continuity over time with staff and leadership turnover. 
Thank you for your attention, and I hope you will join me in supporting this resolve.
