TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF 
L.D. 1033 
AN ACT REGARDING THE ISSUIN G OF DIPLOMAS FOR STUDENTS 
AT THE LONG CREEK YOUTH DEVELOPIVIENT CENTER 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
I am Steven Bailey, executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on behalf of 
the legislative committees of the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School Superintendents 
Association, in support of L.D. 1033, now a Resolve. 
We understand that the amendment to the bill replaces it with a resolve. 
Our associations had been in support of L.D. 1033 because it removed one more obstacle for students 
trying to turn their lives around after spending time in the Long Creek Youth Development Center. 
The amendment allows them to receive a diploma from the public high school they last attended, the 
Arthur R. Gould School or a Maine Department of Education diploma. 
The resolve addresses some of the logistics that had been discussed Within each of our legislative 
committees, such as a student not having attended a local high school prior to entry to Long Creek Youth 
Development Center, or a student who might have been expelled from the high school they last attended. 
MSSA and MSBA legislative committees urge passage of the Resolve, Directing the Department to 
Develop and Distribute Guidance for Diploma Choices at the Arthur R. Gould School.
