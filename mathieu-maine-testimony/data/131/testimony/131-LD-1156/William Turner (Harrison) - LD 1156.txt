 Re: Support for LD 1156:  An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to 
Promote the Design, Development and Maintenance of Trails for Outdoor Recreation 
and Active Transportation”  
Dear Representative Jessica Fay, and distinguished members of the Committee on 
Inland Appropriations and Financial Affairs:
 
I am William A. Turner.  I am blessed to have been a resident of Harrison, Maine, for 
about 35 years and am very privileged to live year round near the East shore of Long 
Lake.  I am a registered Professional Engineer in the Sate of Maine and I am an a very
active walker, hiker, bicycle rider, woodland property owner and a person of Faith.  
Prior to moving to Maine as a permanent resident in 1985, I had enjoyed the privilege 
of hiking and fishing in Maine for much of my growing up years. You can contact me
at btair1@airdiagnostics.com.
As many of you may know, the recreation industry is very important to the people of 
Maine the vast majority of its visitors. Existing trails have seen a vast increase in use 
and a need for continued maintenance especially where ATV's are utilized. It is my 
opinion that the balance of non-motorize and motorized trails is reasonable in the 
proposed funding legislation.  In the past 30 years that I have resided in the state, I 
have too often seen ATV use destroy and ability to hike or ride bicycles on multi-use 
trails. The proposed legislation, if implemented and followed, will limit some of the 
damage that could be done on these trails, or the damage to water quality on adjoining
water bodies and streams. I do not see that this proposed legislation will negatively 
effect the folks enjoying the motorized sports or the business community that they 
support. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
 I encourage you to vote “ought to pass” on LD 1156.
 
Willaim A. Turner
