Dear Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee,
My wife and I walk and hike. That is our primary recreation and exercise. When we 
walk on roads, we feel as if we are rising our lives because of the reckless drivers and 
the ticks in the shoulder grasses.
Many of our trails are poorly maintained and full of ticks. Maine has poor parking, 
signage, and toileting associated with its trails.
If we care about our tourism industry and the well-being of our citizens, we should 
invest in our trails.
Trail maintenance and amenities will create jobs and distribute tourism dollars 
throughout the state. Collaboration with landowners and non-profits can harness 
volunteers and donations.
Please invest in Maine's trail resources. 
Thank you.
