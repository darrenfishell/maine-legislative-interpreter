RE: LD 1789 “An Act to Remove All Marijuana-related Provisions from the Maine 
Criminal Code and Expunge All Convictions Involving Marijuana. ” 
Dear Senator Camey, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Committee on‘ 
Judiciary: 
MACDL supports LD l789. 
Maine legalized medical marijuana use in 1999 and recreational marijuana use in 2016. 
Maine has an Office of Cannabis Policy (“OCP”) that develops and enforces 
administrative rules for the medical and recreational use of marijuana. Notwithstanding 
this legalization, Maine still has laws that criminalize the “cultivation of marijuana ” when 
a person possesses more than 3 mature marijuana plants. 17-A M.R.S. § lll7 & 28-B 
M.R.S. § 1502(1). Some of these laws are even felonies punishable by years in prison for 
possession of plants in quantities that corporations throughout the state possess and sell 
for profit. See, e.g., 17-A M.R.S. § l l17(l)(B)(making it a Class C felony to possess more 
than 100 marijuana plants) and 28-B M.R.S. § 301(4) (allowing a tier 4 facility to process 
up to 20,000 square feet of marijuana plant canopy). The imposition of civil fines on 
persons cultivating marijuana for sale outside of administrative rules imposed by the OCP 
is more than sufficient to regulate this now fully legalized plant. The continued criminal 
prosecution for growing marijuana, regardless of the number of plants, is unnecessary. 
The complete and total decriminalization of marijuana is long overdue and can be safely 
done with the OCP regulatory framework and use of civil penalties only. 
LD 1789 also expunges all marijuana related convictions. Such expungement is consistent 
with a full decriminalization of marijuana and recognizes the unnecessary harm inﬂicted 
from years of senseless marijuana prosecutions. 
Sincerely, 
/(<2/L/I
