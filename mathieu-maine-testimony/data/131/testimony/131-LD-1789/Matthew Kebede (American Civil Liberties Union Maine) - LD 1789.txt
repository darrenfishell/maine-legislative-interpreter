TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL KEBEDE, ESQ 
Ought To Pass - LD 1789 
An Act to Remove All Marijuana-related Provisions from the Maine Criminal Code 
and Expunge All Convictions Involving Marijuana 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
April 27, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary, greetings. My name is Michael Kebede, and I am Policy Counsel for the ACLU of 
Maine, a statewide organization committed to advancing and preserving civil liberties in Maine. 
On behalf our members, I urge you to support LD 1789 because it would ensure that cannabis 
legalization laws are fairly applied, and because it would give a second chance to people who 
were convicted of activity that is now legal. 
In 2016, the people of Maine made landmark progress on cannabis legalization? Their 
decision tojoin the growing number of legal states has transformed the state. By merely regulating 
Z 3 what was already going on all over the state, we have increased employment, tourist revenue, ‘ 
and economic beneﬁts,5 all while ensuring that children use at lower rates.6

However, some of us have been left behind. Although possession of small amounts of 
cannabis was decriminalized in Maine in 1976, it remains a federal crime and many states still 
impose criminal penalties for it. It is still a crime in Maine to possess 2.5 ounces or more of 
cannabis, and possession of over 20 pounds is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. 17-A M.R.S. 
§1l07-A (A)(l)(F). The racial disparities in who is arrested for cannabis possession in Maine are 
startling: a 2020 ACLU study found that Black people in Maine are four times more likely than 
white people to be arrested for cannabis possession in 2018, despite both groups having similar 
rates of usage.7 In York County, Black people were more than twelve times more likely than their 
white peers to be arrested for simple cannabis possession — over 3 times worse than the racial 
disparity nationwide.8 Removing cannabis possession from the criminal code and expunging 
cannabis conviction records would provide some degree of fairness for people who Were punished 
for something that is now legal. 
Some have argued that any legislatively established criminal records expungement system 
would unconstitutionally infringe upon the governor ’s exclusive power to pardon.9 We disagree. 
Pardons and expungements are fundamentally different. Pardons do not necessarily entail 
expungements, and expungements never modify sentences. A pardon frees you from serving any 
remainder of your sentence, or any other penalties attached to the pardoned crime. A pardon is 
available for any crime, at any point after conviction. In contrast, expungement simply removes 
records, and perhaps also makes it unlawful to disseminate certain records. Indeed, expungement 
is simply a more thorough, and a more accelerated, way to do two things the state already does: 
make certain records conﬁdential pursuant to the Criminal History Records Information Act, l6 
M.R.S. §701 et seq., and destroy records under state agency retention schedules. 
We urge you to vote ought to pass.

9 Some lawyers cite State v. Hunter to argue that legislatively established expungement is unconstitutional, although 
the words “expungement ” or “sealing” or “vacatur” do not even appear 1n that case. 447 A.2d 797, 800 (Me. 1982) 
(ruling that a resentencing statute that allowed deductions of a prison sentence was an unconstitutional 
encroachment on the govemor’s commutation power).
