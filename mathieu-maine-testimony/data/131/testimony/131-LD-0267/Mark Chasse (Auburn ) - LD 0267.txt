LD 267 ought-To-pass not for the reasons that this bill was drafted, but because 
woman who received the covid vaccine are likely now spike protein factories and are 
able to pass these to feeding infants. There are potential adverse reactions associated 
with these "gene therapies". Parents should be made aware of these as well. 
Thank you.
