SUPPORT – LD 267, An Act to Require Private Insurance Coverage for Donor Breast Milk
Good afternoon, Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and the distinguished members of the 
Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services Committee. My name is Mikenzie Dwyer, 
I am the Public Health and Government Affairs Associate for the Maine Medical Association 
and I live in Windham. The MMA appreciates the opportunity to submit the following comments 
in support of LD 267 which would require health plans to provide coverage for donor breast 
milk if a physician or physician assistant signs an order stating the infant meets the criteria for 
coverage. 
 
The health effects of breastfeeding are well recognized. Breast milk is the best source of infant 
nutrition and immunologic protection. Breast milk can also be an essential medicine for infants 
on the cusp of life and death, helping to prevent infection and ensure health brain 
development. Pasteurized donor milk is safe and may be considered in situations in which the 
supply of maternal milk is insufficient.  For infants who are extremely medically fragile, human 
breast milk may be the only appropriate food source for them. A 2019 review found that 
feeding premature or low birthweight infants formula rather than donor human breast milk 
nearly doubled the NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis) risk1. Yet the costs and access to donor 
breast milk can be a barrier in accessing this much needed nutrition source. 
Both the American Academy of Pediatrics2 and the Surgeon General3 have called for policy 
changes to improve availability and affordability of donor breast milk. Fourteen states and the 
District of Columbia have enacted legislation or regulations addressing the access barriers for

to require private insurers to provide coverage for donor breast milk and several other states 
are currently seeking similar legislation. 
Given the importance of breastfeeding and breastmilk for the health and well-being of children, 
the Maine Medical Association supports action to support breastfeeding. Following this 
testimony are some links that may be helpful when drafting guidelines for donor human breast 
milk for safety and distribution. 
We thank the committee for considering our comments in support of LD 267 and welcome any 
questions the committee may have for the work session.
Sincerely,
