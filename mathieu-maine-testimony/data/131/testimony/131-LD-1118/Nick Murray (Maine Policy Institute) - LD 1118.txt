Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1118,
“An
Act
to
Reduce
the
Sales
Tax
on
Automobiles”
Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
on
LD
1118.
LD
1118
would
exempt
the
first
$7,500
of
the
value
of
an
automobile
from
sales
tax.
It
would
save
many
Mainers,
especially
those
currently
struggling
to
afford
the
rising
cost
of
living,
gasoline,
heating
fuel,
food,
etc.,
while
state
politicians
refuse
to
offer
meager
tax
relief.
This
is
basic,
commonsense
tax
reform
that
Mainers
not
only
deserve
today,
but
sorely
need.
We
commend
Sen.
Baldacci
for
bringing
it
forward.
Owning
a
vehicle
is
critical
for
nearly
every
resident
of
Maine.
It
is
quite
difficult
to
get
around
the
state
without
one.
Despite
this
necessity,
the
state
has
not
made
it
any
easier
to
afford
an
automobile.
Past
efforts
to
reduce
the
myriad
ways
Maine
drivers
are
nickel-and-dimed
by
the
state
and
localities
have
been
roundly
rejected
by
the
majority
party.
It
is
heartening
to
see
that
a
simple,
commonsense
tax
policy
solution
can
also
be
bipartisan.
The
five-year
cost
of
owning
a
car
in
Maine,
according
to
insurance.com,
though
the
sixth-lowest
in
the
nation,
is
higher
than
in
New
Hampshire,
Massachusetts,
and
Vermont.
While
this
is
made
up
of
several
factors,
reducing
sales
tax
on
automobiles
would
contribute
positively
to
the
ability
of
Mainers
to
afford
the
overall
cost.
Drivers
would
get
to
keep
more
than
$400
that
would
otherwise
be
taken
from
them
by
the
state.
Cost
of
living
in
Maine
is
15%
higher
than
the
national
average,
1
while
the
state’s
median
household
income
is
33rd-highest
in
the
nation.
This
is
why
so
many
Mainers
struggle
to
make
ends
meet,
especially
in
the
last
two
years,
buried
under
historic
inflation.
Through
this
time,
as
the
state
government
brings
in
staggering
amounts
of
taxes,
the
people
have
gotten
very
little
relief,
and
not
which
would
allow
them
to
plan
ahead
for
a
big
purchase
or
other
costs
of
life.
Please
deem
LD
1118
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
help
Mainers
afford
the
high
cost
of
an
automobile
today.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
