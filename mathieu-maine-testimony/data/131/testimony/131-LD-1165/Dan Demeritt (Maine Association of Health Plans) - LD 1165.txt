Testimony of Dan Demeritt — April 6, 2023 
Joint Standing Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services 
In Opposition To 
LD 1165: An Act to Enhance Cost Savings to Consumers of Prescription Drugs 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
Coverage, Insurance, and Financial Services: 
My name is Dan Derneritt, the Executive Director of the Maine Association of Health Plans 
(MeAHP). Our plans include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, CVS / Aetna, 
Community Health Options, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and United Health Care. Our private 
and non-proﬁt insurance carriers provide or administer health insurance coverage to about 
600,000 Maine people. 
Our mission as an association is to improve the health of Maine people by promoting affordable, 
safe, and coordinated healthcare. 
I testify today in opposition to LD 1165. 
Unrelenting growth in pharmaceutical expenditures is a significant driver in the cost of 
health insurance. We urge the committee to preserve plan design options that healthcare 
purchasers and health plans are using to lower the cost of premiums paid by Maine 
employers and their employees. 
Pharmaceuticals are now the most expensive component of America's health care system, 
accounting for more than $0.22 of every health care dollar spent.1 
In 2021 national spending on prescription drugs grew to $603 billion or more than $1,800 
per capita. The growth in spending is driven by increases in utilization and expenditures - 
up 10.9% and 16%, respectively, over five years. A table with these figures accompanies 
my testimony? 
Current law requires that prescription drug benefits -- rebates, discounts, credits, or other 
direct or indirect financial benefits ——be applied to lower costs. The compensation can be

remitted at the point of sale or to the carrier and be applied to plan design to lower 
premiums for the covered persons. This important plan design tool and choice should he 
left to the parties involved instead of being mandated by state law. 
The two cost-saving options - lower premiums or point-of-sale reductions — were 
developed through comprehensive discussion in the 119th Legislature. The resulting statute 
also tasks carriers with providing the Superintendent of the Bureau of Insurance with an 
annual compliance report. 
Additionally, health insurance carriers ’ products, rates, and networks are subject to regulatory 
review and approval. The health plan pharmacy spending trend is also subject to disclosure and 
scrutiny as part of the annual rate review process. 
LD 1165 strikes the phrase “lower premiums ” from existing law and eliminates a tool 
healthcare purchasers and health plans can use to reduce insurance costs for Maine 
employers and their employees. We urge a vote of ought not to pass.
