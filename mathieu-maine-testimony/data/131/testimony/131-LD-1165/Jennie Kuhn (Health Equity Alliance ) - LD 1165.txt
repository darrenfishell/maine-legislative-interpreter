Re: LD 1165, “An Act to Enhance Cost Savings to Consumers of Prescription Drugs”
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services, my name is Jennie Kuhn. I am the lead chair of the CSI 
resource advocacy group at Husson University and the Manager of Health and Well-Being at 
Health Equity Alliance. HEAL is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 501(c)(3) organization that provides 
HIV+ care, sexual health and wellness services, and harm reduction programs in Bangor, 
Ellsworth and Machias. Our work began in 1987 as Down East AIDS Network, and we have a 
commitment to serving some of the most marginalized populations as a regional health justice 
organization. Everyday we fight stigma and the structures that scaffold poor health outcomes of 
our folks. LD1165 comes at a critical and pivotal time for many Mainers, facing rising drug costs 
and economic hardship that continue to ensure tragic health outcomes for our most vulnerable 
folks. LD1165 would allow these PBM rebates to be passed to the people in our communities 
who need support most; those who need life-saving and life-altering prescriptions non-negotiable 
to maintaining their quality of life. Altering the avenue of these rebates from PBMs and insurers 
to our neighbors, children, family members, and the people I see every single day struggling to 
afford prescribed therapies would alter the immediate lives of so many Mainers, instill renewed 
hope in our healthcare system, and ultimately impact overall health outcomes in innumerable 
ways.  
Thank you for your time!
