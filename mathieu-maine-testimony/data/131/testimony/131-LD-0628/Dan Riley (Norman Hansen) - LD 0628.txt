IN RECOGNITION OF THE IRISH CONTRIBUTION TO MAINE 
AND TO THE UNITED STATES 
WHEREAS, St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, known for bringing Christianity to 
Ireland and, it is said, for instilling a sense of literacy and learning that allowed Ireland to become 
the "isle of saints and scholars" when the rest of Europe was in the Dark Ages; and 
WHEREAS, the feast day of St. Patrick is a national holiday that is given recognition outside 
its native land, which indicates the Irish inﬂuence throughout the world; and 
WHEREAS, the modern secular holiday of St. Patrick's Day was ﬁrst celebrated in America 
in Boston during colonial days and the ﬁrst St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York City was in 
1766, and now St. Patrick's Day is celebrated all over America with pride; and 
WHEREAS, millions of Irish people emigrated from Ireland in the 1800s to escape brutal 
poverty and starvation due to the Irish potato famine, and most of those people came to America 
to start new lives and to embrace and contribute to a new land; and 
WHEREAS, tens of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in New England and many came 
to Maine, and the Irish have been an important part of Maine's culture, history and society ever 
since; and 
WHEREAS, within a few years of their arrival in the United States and in Maine, these Irish 
immigrants became part of the American cultural landscape while preserving the best of their 
native culture, and they dedicated themselves to helping build this Nation and State; and
