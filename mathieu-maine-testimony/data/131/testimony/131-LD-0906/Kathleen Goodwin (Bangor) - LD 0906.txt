LD 906
I would like to offer my support of LD 906.  I think that this would help with an early 
diagnosis of Lyme disease.  With the knowledge of disease earlier rather than later, 
quicker response to treatment could help a person's recovery from the disease.  I have 
seen the devastating effects of Lyme disease in my stepdaughter. I feel if her doctor 
would have had access to more diagnostic information, she would have had a quicker 
diagnosis, and her treatment could have starter sooner.
