To the members of the Health and Human Services Committee:
I am writing to show support for changing Lyme testing requirements. I have been 
battling Lyme symptoms over 10yrs and have 3 negative CDC test results. I have a 
LLMD clinical diagnosis, and I think she was last in state to accept Medicare. This 
needs to change,early treatment improves outcomes, this requires better diagnostic 
tools.
Thanks for your attention in this matter,
