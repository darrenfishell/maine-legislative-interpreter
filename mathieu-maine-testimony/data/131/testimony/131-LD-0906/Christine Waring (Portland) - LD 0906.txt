I have 2 daughters with Lyme disease. They have been in treatment for the past 3 and 4 years. One is 12 and the other is 16. Had the doctor tested them and been given the raw data they would have been diagnosed and treated correctly instead of having to live with this disease for the past 5 and 6 years. Because of the lack of information given to the doctors and the lack of a timely diagnosis the Lyme had time to take hold of their bodies. Which has led to devastating consequences on their mental and physical health. Examples of this would be - seizers, chronic headaches, bone and joint bone, all over aching, nausea, vomiting, depression, anxiety an inability to go to school, play with their friend or play sports as well as constant die oﬀ from trying to kill the Lyme and its coinfections. This has put unbelievable ﬁnancial strain on our family. We have spent close to a $500.000. trying to get a handle on this disease. I hope you’ll consider passing this bill so that other children and adults don’t have to go through this.
