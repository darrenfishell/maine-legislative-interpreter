LD 906
I support LD 906 to give clinicians more information to help prevent false negative 
test results for tick-borne illnesses. Earlier diagnosis and treatment are extremely 
important when dealing with these infections. The Western Blot test looks at reactions
to many bands, some of which are known to be specific for Lyme bacteria. Our family
would have had a much different experience with Lyme disease had we been 
diagnosed properly and early on. Instead, it has taken many years of treatment and 
many thousands of dollars. Please pass this bill. There are hundreds, if not thousands, 
of people in Maine who are affected and are depending on you to do the right thing. 
Thank you for your consideration.
