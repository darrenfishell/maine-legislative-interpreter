LD 906
I support LD 906 to give clinicians more information to help prevent false negative 
test results for tick-borne illnesses. Earlier diagnosis and treatment can help prevent 
worse outcomes. The western blot test looks for reactions to bands. Some of those 
bands are known to be more specific to the Lyme bacteria than others. 
Lymedisease.org has several good overviews about the western blot if anyone wants 
to learn more. There are many of us here, in Maine who have had our lives destroyed 
by the failure to diagnose and properly treat these illnesses. Let's work together to 
help prevent that from happening to others. Thank you for your time and 
consideration.
