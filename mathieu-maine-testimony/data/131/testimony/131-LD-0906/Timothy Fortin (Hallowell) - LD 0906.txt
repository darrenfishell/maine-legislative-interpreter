As the partner and business partner for a woman that has been stricken with the 
effects of not only Lyme Disease but also Bartonella (another tick borne illnesses) 
that took doctors years to effectively diagnose, hence allowing those pathogens to 
essentially take over her body, more needs to be done to appropriately diagnose and 
care for those that suffer currently and for those that will suffer in the future. I have 
watched and witnessed her get told that she needed care for a spectrum of issues, 
anywhere between multiple schlerosis to mental health counseling, all because either 
the right tests were not done or the right data wasn't being passed along. Meanwhile 
between several Maine doctors, Massachusetts doctors and various failed treatments, 
she still suffers with and will always suffer with the effects of of a tick bite that if 
treated appropriately sooner may have resulted in a better quality of life moving 
forward. As of now, that is very much in the air as I continue to live with someone 
that is a shell of what they were and is only in their 40's. Imagine going from a 
healthy woman to someone that has constant body pain, tiredness, and has the 
immune system of someone decades older. Going from a full-time real estate agent 
selling millions of dollars of housing every year to someone that hasn't been able to 
work productively for three years. Now imagine that person was your partner. Thank 
you for your time and consideration.
