Amy MacDonald - Testimony in support of LD 906 An Act To Ensure Physicians Receive Full 
Diagnostic Test Data Concerning Tick-borne Diseases 
In Person Testimony: 
Good afternoon Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and Members of the Health and Human 
Services Committee 
My name is Amy MacDonald and I would like to share my personal experience with tick-borne illness 
testing. 
For 10 years, I was a multi-million dollar producing real estate agent at the top of my industry. 
Overnight my world changed with the onset of strange symptoms that took 3 years to figure out. 
I went from feeling great, being a productive member of society, enjoying raising my 3 beautiful girls, 
to being unable to function due to extreme head and neck pain and numbness on the right side of my 
body that would come on without warning...amongst other symptoms. 
After 3 years and 3 rounds of negative Lyme test results with my PC, I got a second opinion. This 
doctor sent my blood sample (taken within 10 days of the last sample my PC took) to a different lab. 
This lab sent the raw data with the results which showed positive bands for Lyme Disease. 
By the time I was properly diagnosed, I was at the chronic stage of Lyme and Bartonella. Despite 
going through 3 years of treatments, that thankfully got me back to work, I have ongoing issues that 
will keep me from being the person I once was. 
During the course of the last 3 years my partner and I spent over $35,000 out of pocket on treatment 
expenses not covered by insurance and we lost over $300,000 in income from me not being able to 
work. 
The impact of this bill goes beyond patients. The amount of money my insurance company spent in 
the 3 years I went undiagnosed was extremely high. 
MRI’s, CAT Sean's, a Lumbar Puncture, a 4 day stay at Maine General, and a trip to Boston’s MS 
Lahey Clinic cost my insurance company more than a pretty penny. 
Multiply this by the hundreds of patients each year in Maine seeking a diagnosis and it is safe to say 
that hundreds of thousands of dollars could be saved by insurance companies. 
The toughest part for me to think about and speak about is the fact that my children have missed out 
on having an active mom in their life. My youngest daughter doesn’t even remember what I was like 
before I got sick.
All of this is preventable for other Mainers if doctors are simply given the raw data from labs that they 
are already producing during testing. Let’s give doctors all the tools to increase early, correct 
diagnosis. Without early treatment of tick-borne diseases, you or someone you love, could experience 
something similar to what I have gone through. After all, I was a normal, productive person, just like 
you 7 years ago. 
Thank you for your time and consideration on this very important bill. I welcome further discussion 
and am happy to answer any questions you may have.
More Information: 
I support LD 906 An Act To Ensure Physicians Receive Full Diagnostic Test Data Concerning 
Tick-borne Diseases 
Over the course of three years from 2016 to 2019, I had a wide range of strange symptoms: 
Q One night in October of 2016 I went to bed ﬁne. When I woke in the morning, the vision in my 
left eye was extremely blurry. I went to my eye doctor, they gave me a different prescription but 
didn’t seem alarmed that my vision changed overnight. 5 weeks later my vision returned andI 
went back to my previous prescription. 
Q Winter 2016/2017 - Lhermitte's sign started—electric zap starting at the base of my skull 
shooting down my spine. This would hit at any time and would keep me awake at night. 
Q 2017 - Parts of my body (like one lower leg) would go numb for a period of time (usually a few 
hours) This happened on a daily basis. 
Q Fall of 2017 - over the course of a few days the entire right side of my body went numb. I was 
hospitalized for four days. 
Q I underwent MRI’s, CAT scans, spinal tap/lumbar puncture and I was misdiagnosed with MS 
Q I was sent to Boston's MS Lahey Clinic and after being assessed told “based on your 
symptoms, it looks like you have MS but you don't because your brain scan would show it. You 
fall into the gray area of people we can’t ﬁgure out. 
Q I was told by one doctor during this period of time that I should consider getting counseling. 
Q By 2019, lwas having continued numbness, cognitive issues, and extreme head and neck 
pain where the only thing I could do was wrap my head in ice and pray for the pain to subside. 
0 In September of 2019, my doctor, Dr. Amy Trelease-Bell, tested me for the third time for Lyme 
and she got a negative diagnosis. Within 10 day's of my doctors test, Dr. Mari Sawai also 
tested me and got a positive diagnosis. The big difference between these two tests was Dr. 
Mari was given the raw data by the lab to interpret alongside my symptoms and Dr. 
Trelease-Bell was not. 
Q It took 3 years to be diagnosed with Chronic Lyme and Chronic Bartonella. In this time, I ended 
up with permanent cognitive issues and muscle atrophy on the right side of my body that will 
likely never return to normal. 
I have spent over $35,000 out of pocket on my treatment because insurance doesn't cover it.I 
was out of work for the better part of 3 years which meant losing over 100k a year in income to 
my family.
All of this could have been prevented if my doctor received the raw data from the lab because 
she would have seen that there were some positive bands for Lyme in my system and been 
able to combine that with my symptoms to make a diagnosis. 
The goal of this bill is to simply provide doctors with information that the labs are already producing as 
an added tool for diagnosing Tick-borne Diseases. 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

WESTERN BLOTS, C6 ELISAS, LYl\/IE lgG / lglVi ELISA?» 
Lyme lgG and lgllil Western blot Kits ~ This kit is a membrane immunoassay based on the Western blot method. As recommended by the CDC, all samples which test positive or indeterminate on a seroiogical screening test should be re-tested on a B. burgdorferi Western blot test. B. burgdorferi Western blot lgG and igiifi assays are recommended for the evaluation of sera from patients believed to be in the ﬁrst four weeks of infection, while an |gG assay alone is recommencled for evaluation of sera from patients with symptoms of late Lyme disease. 
Report Key - The Alternative interpretive Criteria is based upon a study published by MDL‘s Clinical Director, _Dr. Richard Tllton (Tilton RC, Sand MN, l\/lanak M. (1997). The Western lmmunoblot for Lyme Disease: Determin_at_ion of Sensitivity, Speciﬁcity, and interpretive Criteria with Use of Commercially Available Performance Panels. Clinical infectious Disease. 251831-4). Reprints are available upon request.

Negcjatlvie Results: Additional specimens should be submitted in 2-4 weeks if B. burgdorferl exposure has not been ru e ou. 
Positive Results: The corresponding antibodies (lgG or lglvl) to significant B. burgdorferi proteins detected; presumptive evidence of probable exposure. 
The use of the Lyme Western blot on Cerebrospinal fluid is an off-labe/ application and is for investigations! use only. This test kit was designed for human serum specimens. There is no validation data available for the use of this test on human Cereb/'osp/' na/ fluid (CSF) specimens. 
The major differences between the interpretative criteria are: 
1. lgM - The Alternative Criteria is similar to the CDC except that the 93 band has been included as a significant lgilll band specific to B. burgdorferi. 
2. lgG —- The Alternative Criteria is based on both the number of bands and the significance of the antibodies getected. For example, Osp A (31) and Osp B (34) are important bands seen often in late stages of Lyme isease. 
3. There is an "equivocal" category for both lgG and lgM blots which indicates that although there are not sufficient 
antlbodydbands present for the blot to be reactive, there is significant immunologic activity that may be related to yrne isease.

C6 Lyme _l'£LlSA Diagnostic Kit - lmmunetics reports that their FDA approved diagnostic kit is 98% specific and 97% sensitive in comprehensive clinical trials of Lyme patients at every stage of the disease - from early onset to late stage disseminated infection. The C6 Lyme ELISA can also distinguish between true infections and vaccination responses. ' 
Lyme index] interpretation 
Negative result. No antibody to B. burgdorferi detected in the present assay. This result does not exclude the possibility of B. burgdorferi infection, and where early Lyme disease is suspected, a 1 
second sample should be drawn 2-4 weeks later and re-tested. s 0.90A 
Equivocal result. The imprecision inherent to any method implies a lower degree of confidence in the interpretation of samples with A450 values very close to the calculated out oft value. 0.91 — 1.09 For this reason, an equivocal result has been designated. Equivocal samples should be tested lwith a supplemental assay such as a standardized Western blot test in accordance with CDC! ASTPHLD recommendations. 
Positive result. Antibody to B. burgdorfer/' detected in the present assay. All positive results should be supplemented by re~testing the corresponding serum samples on a standardized Western blot test in accordance with CDC/ASTPHLD recommendations. 21.10 
Lyme lgG I lgltll ELISA ~ This test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELlSA) designed for the qualitative presumptive detection of total (lgG and lgM) antibodies to B. burgdorferi in human serum. The test system should only be used for patients with signs and symptoms that are consistent with Lyme disease. Equivocal or positive results must be supplemented with testing with a standardized Western blot procedure. Positive supplemental lLesults d_are supportive evidence of exposure to B. burgdorfer/' and can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of yme rsease. 
Effective for resu/is verified on or after 7/27/2006

interpretation 
< 0 90* Negative result. No detectable antibody; result does not exclude B. burgdorferi infection. An ‘ ‘ 
additional sample should be tested within 4-6 weeks if early infection is suspected. 
’Equivocai result. Current recommendations state that equivocal results should be followed by supplemental Western blot. (Western blot assays for B. burgdorferi are supplemental rather 0.91 - 1.09"‘ than conﬁrmatory because their specificity is less than optimal. particularly for detecting lgivl.) 
This equivocal result should be reported with results from V\1'estern blot testing. Results should _ not be reported until the supplemental testing is completed.
