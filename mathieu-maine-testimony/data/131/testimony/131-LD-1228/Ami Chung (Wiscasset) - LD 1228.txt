LD 1228
My son who is fifteen years old and has for philosophical reasons has not been 
vaccinated.  Under LD 51he was able to attend school all his life. When LD 51 was 
over turned, he could no longer attend school in Maine, and there are no hopes for 
college.  He presently does online high school, and will have to search elsewhere for 
college. This is not only costly to our family but also a difficult situation for a 
teenager to lose his peer groups, diversity of teachers and extra-circular activities.  
Maine Legislators should be aware of how this change has affected our family and 
marginalized us socially and ostracized us from our community!
