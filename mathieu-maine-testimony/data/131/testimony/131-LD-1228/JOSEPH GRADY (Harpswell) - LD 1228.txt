The Covid 19 "pandemic" revealed deep, institutional problems with the ways in 
which our society determines what is necessary to keep citizens "safe". The policy 
platforms, mandates, and mainstream supported narrative have all been proven to be 
deeply flawed and, in some cases, actually dangerous to the public. Enforcement of 
mask mandates, vaccine mandates, social distancing, school and business closures, 
and the suppression and demonization of effective early treatments against Covid 19 
were driven by hubris, arrogance, and conflicts of interest above a dedication to 
public safety. No family should ever again have to choose between their rights as 
citizens and the pharmaceutical or non pharmaceutical interventions imposed by 
government policy.
