Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs  
Testimony of Hannah A. Hudson on behalf of Maine Immunization Coalition  
April 3 , 2023  
 
In Opposition To:  
LD 1228 , An Act to Prohibit Certain Higher Education Institutions from Requiring 
Vaccines Approved Under Emergency Use Authorization for Admission or Attendance  
 
Sponsored By:  Representative Smith  
 
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint  Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, I am Hannah Hudson, a member of the 
Maine Immunization Coalition and the Policy and Communications Manager at Maine 
Primary Care Association (MPCA). MPCA serves as the administrative home of the MIC.  
 
The MIC is  a network of associations, health care  systems, and providers working to 
protect Maine people across their lifespan against vaccine -preventable diseases, by 
increasing immunization rates through information sharing  and collaboration. As a 
statewide group, we undertake collaborative advocacy on immunization. Our e fforts to 
promote evidence -based policies that result in improved immunization rates for 
children and adults in the State of Maine.  
 
We are opposed to LD 1228. It is important to note that Maine does not require Covid -
19 immunizations for school entry, and all our vaccine laws preserve valid medical 
exemptions.  
 
An emergency use authorization (EUA) is a tool the FDA can use to expedite the 
availability of medical products, including vaccines, during a public health emergency 
like the COVID -19 pandemic. An EUA can only be granted when no adequate, approved, 
availab le alternatives exist, and when the known and potential benefits outweigh the 
potential risks. It is the job of the FDA to ensure medical products meet rigorous safety 
and efficacy standards, a process that can take years for what’s called “full approval.”  
Though that timeline is condensed when an EUA is granted, the FDA still upholds its 
strict standards.  An EUA only lasts as long as the public health emergency for which it 
was declared.1

Covid -19 is a serious disease . Contracting it can cause pneumonia ,2 chronic fatigue3, injury to organs4, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome5, septic shock6, blood clots7, and death8. Students have the right to 
attend school in a safe environment, especially those with medical conditions that put them at increased 
risk of harm in the event of an outbreak of disease.  
 
Colleges and schools must continually assess how they balance individ ual liberty with their responsibility 
to ensure safe communities. Implementing any kind of ban undermines this authority and hinders their 
responsibility to protect employees and students.  
 
MIC is happy to be available for the work session. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly at 
hhudson@mepca.org  if I can answer any questions.
