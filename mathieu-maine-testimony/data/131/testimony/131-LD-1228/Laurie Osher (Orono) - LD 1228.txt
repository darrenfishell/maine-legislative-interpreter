Af fairs
Senator
Rafferty,
Representative
Brennan,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Education
and
Cultural
Affairs
Committee,
I
am
Laurie
Osher ,
I
represent
House
District
125,
the
majority
of
Orono.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
express
my
opposition
to
LD
1228:
An
Act
to
Pr ohibit
Certain
Higher
Education
Institutions
fr om
Requiring
V accines
Appr oved
Under
Emergency
Use
Authorization
for
Admission
or
Attendance.
The
University
of
Maine
is
in
my
district,
and
that
fact
has
a
huge
impact
on
the
demographics.
My
district
is
the
youngest
district
in
the
state:
nearly
40%
of
the
adults
in
District
25
are
between
18
and
24
years
old
and
nearly
80%
of
adults
in
the
district
are
35
and
under .
Students
attending
the
University
are
from
all
fifty
states.
There
are
students
from
Puerto
Rico,
the
US
Virgin
Islands
and
from
Northern
Mariana
and
there
are
students
at
the
University
of
Maine
from
nearly
eighty
countries.
The
University’ s
public
health
protocols
are
designed
to
protect
the
University
students
and
also
to
protect
the
staff
and
faculty
and
the
members
of
the
larger
Orono
and
Greater
Bangor
area
community
against
diseases
that
could
be
transmitted
by
those
who
are
traveling
to
campus
from
places
near
and
far.
Those
protocols
are
based
on
science.
During
the
height
of
the
coronavirus
pandemic,
the
University
of
Maine’ s
public
health
protocols
succeeded
in
ensuring
the
safety
of
students,
faculty
and
staff.
Those
protocols
included
instituting
regular
testing,
requiring
masking,
and
requiring
vaccinations.
The
speed
at
which
the
vaccinations
were
developed
and
became
available
was
impressive.
The
vaccinations
used
were
so
new
that
they
were
approved
under
emer gency
authorization.

This
bill
proposes
to
prevent
The
University
of
Maine
System,
the
Maine
Community
College
System
and
the
Maine
Maritime
Academy
from
requiring
a
student
be
immunized
with
a
vaccine
that
is
approved
by
the
federal
Food
and
Drug
Administration
under
emer gency
use
authorization
as
a
condition
of
acceptance
or
attendance.
This
bill,
if
passed,
would
be
an
extreme
overreach
by
the
legislature
into
the
administration
of
public
health
protocols
by
these
institutions.
Because
COVID-19
incidence
is
decreasing,
the
University
of
Maine
is
lifting
the
COVID-19
vaccination
requirement
beginning
with
the
May
2023
term.
This
change
from
requiring
vaccinations
to
relaxing
that
requirement
is
based
on
public
health
information.
A
bill
from
the
legislature
wasn’ t
needed
or
consulted
to
make
this
decision.
This
bill
is
a
rejection
of
the
wisdom
of
those
whose
job
it
is
to
protect
the
health
of
all
members
of
the
University
community .
This
bill
is
a
rejection
of
the
science
that
informs
public
health
management
and
public
health
protocols.
As
a
scientist,
I
find
this
overreach
frightening.
I
urge
this
Committee
to
vote
ought
not
to
pass
on
LD
1228:
An
Act
to
Pr ohibit
Certain
Higher
Education
Institutions
fr om
Requiring
V accines
Appr oved
Under
Emergency
Use
Authorization
for
Admission
or
Attendance.
