Good morning, 
I am writing to you today as a non-traditional student in Maine. After 20 years in 
corporate America, I made the decision to change careers and re-entered college as a 
"non-traditional" (old) student. It was a big move, not one I took lightly. 
After much consideration I chose Nursing. I have a passion for medicine and science. 
While I may not be the most clever, I am dedicated and relentless. 
Once classes started I was reminded of my love for learning. The courses were all 
online due to covid, but I was eagerly awaiting the return to campus and my first 
clinical rotations. 
This was a move supported by my husband, in every aspect. Which meant additional 
work for him at home, and a massive financial burden for our family as we paid for 
these classes out of pocket. 
Imagine our shock and dismay as the colleges started mandating the covid vaccine. I 
contacted the hospital I was scheduled to work at, they would allow me to work with 
a medical exemption, but the college would not allow me on campus for more than 15
minutes. So I could work at the hospital but not enter classes on campus. How 
absurd!! 
As time has passed we can see, with proof, the Covid vaccine is a failure. It does not 
prevent the virus or the spread of the virus. 
This mandate has cost the state good students, medical professionals, and 
immeasurable revenue. People like me, who invested in higher education, were just 
pushed out with no recourse, and no path forward. 
Please do the right thing are reject vaccine mandates. Let's not make this mistake 
again.
Thank you for your time.
