I'm submitting testimony in support of LD 51, to restore religious and philosophical 
exemptions to immunization requirements.  My background is a masters in theology 
with ongoing missions work and doctor of chiropractic.  I grew up in Washington 
County and currently live in Hermon.  Maine is a wonderful state with wonderful 
people.  We are all people who make mistakes, it's part of being human.  The key is to
right the ship and fix mistakes that were made.  The requirement to get immunized 
according to the recommendations of the CDC vaccine schedule in order to get an 
education was a mistake.  Education should be an opportunity of all Maine residents 
regardless of religious beliefs.  My kids were released from Hermon schools due to 
our religious AND philosophical objections to vaccines, essentially a 'don't let the 
door hit you on the way out' kind of feeling.  It was horrible for my kids to experience
and go through.  'Get all these vaccines and boosters or you can't get an education' is 
the clear message.  We were discriminated against because of our beliefs, which goes 
against the very foundations of our country.  Were we being overrun with disease or 
on the verge of being overrun?  NO! Religious and philosophical exemptions have 
been around for many, many decades with no problems.  I simply ask to undo a 
mistake, let our children get an education without discrimination due to our religious 
beliefs and the ability to choose what goes into our bodies.  I'm more than happy to go
into detail my religious and philosophical beliefs when it comes to vaccines.   I pray 
for wisdom in the decisions you make which affect many Maine-ers.
