Good afternoon Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and distinguished members
of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
My name is Regina Creeley and I am testifying in support of L.D. 1228, and 1148.  
My residence is in Hudson and I’m a retired special education teacher.  In 2014, I was
voted Special Education Professional of the year (by the Maine Administrators of 
Services for Children with Disabilities (MADSEC)).
 In seventh grade I was invited to my best friend’s family Christmas party.  There 
were about ten adults adults and a group of us kids.  We were having fun and the 
adults were laughing and smoking their cigarettes.  The smoke was so thick.    It was 
making it hard for me to breathe and my eyes started to water around midnight when 
the presents were handed out.  One of the kindly adults said, “Oh don’t cry, we have 
presents for you, too.  I said,  “No, no!  The cigarette smoke is making my eyes water.
The kindly adults around me said, “Cigarette smoke doesn’t bother anyone.  Look at 
the other children.  They aren’t bothered by the smoke.”  The kindly adults loved their
cigarettes and 25 years ago I loved vaccines.  To me they were proof that the world 
was getting better and better.  Separate from that, I was noticing the alarming increase
in childhood disabilities. My computer searches were all saying it was caused by 
vaccine ingredients.  I said, “No,no that couldn’t be.”   But the thousands of pages I 
have read, say it is.  Vaccine ingredients combine with poisons in our environment 
especially glyphosate and can cause many types of harm.  
The increase in childhood medical conditions is very real.  Our society will collapse 
due to it.  We need to considered all the potential culprits and not force parents to 
pierce the skin of their little children to put chemical concoctions into their little 
muscles.  
There are dozens of books out there saying vaccine ingredients can cause harm.  
Nobody has sued those authors for lying.  On the other hand, all the major vaccine 
manufacturers have been sued and convicted for lying about their various medical 
products.  They have said their products were safe when the courts proved that 
thousands died due to their dishonesty.   
The medical establishment was wrong about cigarettes and cancer, Vioxx and heart 
attacks, thalidomide and birth defects, opioids and addiction.  The medical 
establishment is not always right and mandates exaggerate their mistakes.  When 
families can make up their own minds, the tragedies of medical mistakes will not be a 
total disaster for a society.  If everybody does everything the same, society doesn’t 
learn its lessons until its too late.
In conclusion, thank you  for listening so carefully to everyone's testimony.  Thank 
you for running for office and serving as legislators.  I admire you all for your 
conscientious service to fellow Mainers.
