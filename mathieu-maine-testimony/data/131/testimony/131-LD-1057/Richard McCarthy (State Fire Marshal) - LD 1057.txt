TESTIMONY OF RICHARD MCCARTHY 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
(In Opposition) L.D. 1057 
â€œAn Act to Promote Consumer Protections in the Residential Building 
Sector by Requiring Contractors and Subcontractors to Supply Evidence of 
lnsurance" 
Presented by: Senator Curry 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
AND PUBLIC SAFETY 
Hearing Date: Monday, March 27th, 2023, at 1:00 PM in Room 436, State House 
Good afternoon, Senator Beebe-Center, Representative 
Salisbury, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Criminal Justice and Public Safety. 
My name is Richard McCarthy, and I am the State Fire 
Marshal, I am here today representing the Department of 
Public Safety and the Office of State Fire Marshal to testify in 
opposition of this bill. 
Our office currently reviews plans for new construction 
and renovations of public buildings within the State of Maine. 
In 2022 we reviewed and permitted 771 projects worth a total 
of $1.4 Billion. This is performed by 3 fulltime reviewers within
our office consisting of projects ranging from a small daycare to 
a 9 story hospital addition! 
LD 1057 as written would require my office to also review 
and permit residential buildings, that are currently not under 
our jurisdiction. Using data on new residential housing starts 
for 2022 that would add 4,600 permits to our workload. After 
discussions with Sen. Curry this was not his intent to add this 
amount of work to our office. This amount of additional work 
could not be absorbed within our current structure. 
Thank you for your time today and I would be happy to 
answer any questions you may have at this time or during the 
work session.
