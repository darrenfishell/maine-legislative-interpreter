Testimony Supporting LD1604, LINDA HASKELL, Garland, Co-chair Republican Party of Garland 
Good Morning, Addressing the Chairperson, Senators and Representatives 
I support amending the Constitution of Maine to extend from one 
year to 18 months the period of time that signatures are valid on a petition 
for a direct initiative of legislation. As written in LD1604. 
I do believe this is a turn in the right direction, taking adequate time to valid signatures ona 
petition for a direct initiative of legislation. Professional and honest intentions are a must for 
the future of the State of Maine and the USA. May God be with us in these times of turmoil. 
Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?
