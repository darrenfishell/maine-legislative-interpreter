Testimony of Senator Anne Carney introducing 
LD 118, An Act to Ensure Continuity of Care for Pretrial Defendants 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
February 9, 2023 
Representative Moonen and Esteemed colleagues on the Joint Standing Cormnittee on Judiciary, 
as you know I am Anne Carney, proudly representing Senate District 29, which includes South 
Portland, Cape Elizabeth, and part of Scarborough. Today I am pleased to introduce a 
Department of Health and Human Services bill, LD 118, “An Act to Ensure Continuity of Care 
for Pretrial Defendants. ” 
LD 118 would authorize the State Forensic Service to share prior court-ordered evaluation 
reports with institutions that are authorized to accept for admission pretrial defendants who are 
committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services. This would 
greatly help in ensuring that an individual with health care needs who is detained receives an 
appropriate placement. Equally important, the bill would authorize service providers to access 
the State Forensic Service report, which would facilitate treatment planning. 
There is more to this bill, so I would like to turn to Sarah Miller, here on behalf of the 
Department of Health and Human Services, to provide additional information about the need for 
this amendment to Maine’s procedures for placement, care and treatment of persons in custody 
who have mental health care needs or disabilities. She will provide more detailed testimony, as 
well as answer your speciﬁc questions about the bill. 
Thank you for your consideration and time.
