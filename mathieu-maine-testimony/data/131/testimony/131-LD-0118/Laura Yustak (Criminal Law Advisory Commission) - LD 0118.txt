 The Criminal Law Advisory Commission (CLAC)* respectfully submits the following  
testimony in support of LD 118.   
 
CLAC supports LD 118 , which would provide additional relevant information  to treatment 
providers responsible for the care and custody of the defendant.    CLAC points out that additional 
information may be av ailable in evaluations performed at the request of the defendant ’s counsel.   It 
may be appropriate  for such reports, if considered by the court for the purpose s of commitment to 
the cu stody of the Commissioner  of DHHS, to also be made available to the institution or residential  
program into which the defendant  is placed.
