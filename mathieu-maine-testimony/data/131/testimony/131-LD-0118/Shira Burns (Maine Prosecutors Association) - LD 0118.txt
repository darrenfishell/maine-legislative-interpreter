 “An Act to Ensure Continuity of Care for Pretrial Defendants ”  
Befor e the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary  
 
Public Hearing Date: February 9, 2023  
Testimony in Support of  LD 118  
 
Senator Carney , Representative Moonen  and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary . My name is Shira Burns and I represent th e Maine Prosecutors Association. I am here to 
testify in support of  LD 118.  
 
What we refer to as 15 -101 cases, are sometimes the most hard and complex cases to handle for 
everyone in the criminal justice system. The State Forensic Service reports are a vital  tool we use in 
assessing culpability , determining long term level of care,  and can guide the conversations 
regarding final disposition. That is how important they are in the criminal justice realm. It is even 
more imperative that the information contained  in the State Forensic Service r eports be released to 
service providers that provide the care and treatment of the defendant.  This not only benefits the 
treatment of the defendant, but can help with the safety of hea lthcare workers.   
 
For these reasons, th e Maine Prosecutors Association is in support  LD 118.
