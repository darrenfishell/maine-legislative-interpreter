President of the Senate 131st Legislature Augusta. Maine 04333 
Testimony in Support of LD 592 
An Act to Amend the Law Governing MaineCare Coverage of Chiropractic Treatment 
Presented to the loint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
April 19,2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services, my name is Troylackson. I serve as President of the Maine Senate 
and have the great honor of representing Aroostook County in the Legislature. l am here today 
to introduce LD 592, ”An Act to Amend the Law Governing MaineCare Coverage of Chiropractic 
Treatment." 
In 2018, the Maine Legislature passed a law requiring MaineCare to cover chiropractic 
evaluation and management examinations. The legislation before you today simply seeks to 
extend this coverage to include all chiropractic services. This extension of coverage would 
ensure that Mainers have the coverage to pursue the care that's best for them, which for many 
includes chiropractic treatment. This care has the potential to provide pain relief to Mainers for 
whom medication treatment is not in their best interest, and this bill will ensure that Doctors of 
Chiropractic will be reimbursed to the full extent oftheir care for conditions that they are 
licensed to treat. 
I urge you to vote in favor of this bill. Thank you for your time, I will attempt to answer any 
questions you may have for me but I believe that there are experts planning to testify after me 
that will have more subject matter expertise.
