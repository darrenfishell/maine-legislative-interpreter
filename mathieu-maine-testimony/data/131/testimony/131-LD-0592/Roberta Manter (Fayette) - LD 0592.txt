LD 592
Members of the Committee on Health and Human Services:
My name is Roberta Manter and I live in Fayette.  I am writing in favor of LD 592.  I 
began having debilitating Migraine headaches in 1981, after an accident while 
training a horse. I was convinced at the time that my neck was not in alignment, but 
the doctor at the walk-in clinic said that was not possible.  I couldn't afford further 
tests to prove my conviction.
I suffered with migraines for the next twenty years.  Then I found a chiropractor who 
has the equipment necessary for doing an exact alignment of the Atlas, the bone that 
connects the spine to the skull.  The treatments I received there always stopped my 
migraines when they occurred, and they occurred less and less often and with less 
severity.  I have not had a migraine for the last twelve years.
My husband was having episodes where he would suddenly feel woozy and would 
fall.  He was tested for all kinds of possible causes including epilepsy, brain tumor, 
narcolepsy, and I forget what else.  They found no explanation.  Then he went to the 
chiropractor, and after his neck was put into alignment, the episodes stopped.  On 
another occasion he dislocated the acromio-clavicular joint in his shoulder.  The 
emergency room told him there was nothing that could be done for it, that it would 
eventually heal but he would always have a bump.  After suffering all weekend, on 
Monday he went to the chiropractor, who realigned his shoulder, greatly reducing the 
pain and the recovery time.
Our daughter has chronic migraines and back pain.  Her chiropractor gives her 
tremendous relief, but because Maine Care doesn't cover it, she cannot afford to go 
very often, so she suffers instead.
Chiropractic care has been proven effective in resolving certain causes of pain and 
restoring people's ability to work.  But not everyone can afford it.
Please vote LD 592 Ought to Pass.  Thank you.
