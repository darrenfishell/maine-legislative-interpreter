LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of 
Invasive Aquatic Plants.
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because: I am a summer 
camp owner and one of the reasons families and their children choose to spend time in
Maine is the water quality of the lakes. Anything less than would affect my business 
and reduce revenue that visitors bring to the state.
Furthermore, as a Maine resident, I enjoy the opportunities that water quality helps 
engender. I am an enthusiastic fisherman and canoeist and the prospect of subpar 
water quality in the lakes I enjoy would impair the experiences I, and others, currently
enjoy.
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread 
because it is low cost to the user and very effective in mitigating the spread of 
invasive species from lake to lake.
 Please vote to support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species﻿
spread.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Sincerely,
Andy Lilienthal
