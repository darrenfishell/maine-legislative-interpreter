LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of 
Invasive Aquatic Plants.
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because I have observed the 
damage caused to the ecosystem and property on bodies of water such as Lake Arrowhead 
and Pleasant Pond. With the infestation of milfoil on Androscoggin Lake, invasive species 
have reached the watershed of our home, Parker Pond, for the first time. 
                                                                          
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread because 
it would require individuals who pose the greatest risk of invasive species spread (i.e. boaters
who move their boats from one body of water to another) to take a simple, active step to 
benefit the lakes we all want to continue to enjoy. I am committed to doing my part to keep 
our waters free of invasive plant species, for example, as a member of Parker Pond's 
volunteer Invasive Plant Patrol, and believe it a very reasonable step to ask everyone who 
shares these waters to do a small part to keep them healthy by draining their live wells, 
ballast tanks and bilges. I believe educating boaters at courtesy boat inspections would be an
excellent way to spread knowledge of the new law.
 Please vote to support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species﻿
spread.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Signed,
