LD 92
Please support LD 92.  It is a common sense measure to protect our lakes from further
invasive species.  The changes over the last decade have been terrible and things are 
getting worse.  Local lake associations are doing their best to fight invasives but our 
resources are limited.  If this bill passes, our Courtesy Boat Inspectors could politely 
tell boaters about the importance of draining out fluids.  Even without staff to fine 
people or enforce the law I think just the ability to tell boaters about the law would 
change a lot of behavior.   Please help us save our lakes before they turn into green 
masses of foreign vegetation as they are in many states further south.
