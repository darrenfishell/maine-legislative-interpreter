Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
I am writing today to ask for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive Aquatic Plants
I am a property owner on Lake Androscoggin, a location enjoyed by previous generations of my family. The discovery in 2020 of variable leaf milfoil was a shock but not necessarily a surprise. The lake has a public access boat ramp and hosts numerous bass ﬁshing tournaments throughout the summer season. This highly invasive plant was, no doubt, a hitchhiker on a visiting boat.
The Clean, Drain and Dry approach makes a lot of sense and asking boat owners to remove drain plugs before transporting their boats is logical step in preventing invasives’ spread and presents a low threshold to compliance.
In fact, the presence of Courtesy Boat inspectors on many lakes provides a friendly outreach and educational opportunity to introduce this new rule.
Despite three years of constant monitoring and removal of this invasive in Lake Androscoggin these eﬀorts have not succeeded in eliminating the threat to the lake. Prevention is the way to protect our lakes and so I ask you to vote to support LD 92 as a smart way of reducing the spread of invasive species.
Thank you,
Katherine Mahoney
