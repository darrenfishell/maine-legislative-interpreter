LD 92
Dear Committee Members, 
I am writing in support of LD 92, An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants. Requiring a person to drain their vessel and other equipment is a 
simple no-cost way every boater in Maine can help reduce the possibility of 
transporting invasive plants and animals. Reducing the spread of invasives protects 
our natural resources and our economy. Please vote in support of this bill.
