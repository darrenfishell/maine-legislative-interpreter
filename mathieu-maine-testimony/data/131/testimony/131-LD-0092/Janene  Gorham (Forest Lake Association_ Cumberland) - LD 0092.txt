LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants.
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because:                        
one invasive species can virtually wipe out a body of water and render it impassable for 
canoes, kayaks, fishing boats, and swimming.                                                                            
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread because: 
Draining bilge water after leaving a water body will increase the chances of invasive plant 
fibers being flushed out and then drying out and dying before entering another water body.     
Please vote to support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species spread.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Signed,
