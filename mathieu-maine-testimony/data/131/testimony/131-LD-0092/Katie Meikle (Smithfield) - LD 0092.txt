LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee:
I am writing to ask for your support for LD 92: an Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants. 
My husband, Don Schassberger and I have owned nearly 30 acres on North Pond since 1993
and have been full time residents of Smithfield since 2013. We are members of the North 
Pond Association board and are LakeSmart evaluators.
Our NPA membership dues and returnable bottle collection help to fund trained courtesy boat
inspectors (CBI) who check boats and trailers at the public launch for invasive plants such as 
Eurasian milfoil. There are however, several private boat launches on our lake as well as in 
the serpentine flowing from East Pond into North Pond. In 2021 another invasive, Curly-leaf 
Pond Weed was discovered by a local resident.
East Pond, North Pond, 7 Lakes and Maine DEP are working together to clear this invasive 
by hiring specially trained divers to collect plant material. This work is difficult and expensive. 
Volunteer paddle surveys ( in which Don and I have participated ) have been conducted in an 
attempt to identify and contain the spread. 
If boaters check their boats, trailers and gear before moving from one body of water to 
another, this would help to prevent the spread of invasive plants.
Please support LD 92.
Thank you,
Katie Meikle Vice President NPA
