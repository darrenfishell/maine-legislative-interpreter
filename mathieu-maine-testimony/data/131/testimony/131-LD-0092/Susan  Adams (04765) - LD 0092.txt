Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,  
 
 
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants.  
 
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because I have seen the 
damage in person at Lake Androscoggin and on other lakes in NH.  Once it is there , it 
is almost impossible to mitigate. Those putting their boats in for fishing tournaments,  
and pleasure need to understand what they might be transporting and  we need laws in place to deter as many as possible from spreading these invasives. They also need education in what to look for when there are signs asking boats to stay clear as milfoil is present and being monitored and removed. Have watched many boats ignore these as well. 
 
                                                                                                                                                  
 
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread because every little bit helps, along with more education and site monitoring of 
boats.                                                                                                                                  
            
Please vote to support LD  92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species spread.
 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.  
 
Thank you

All Maine lakes  are at risk, they belong to all Maine residents and we need to find more 
ways to protect them.
