Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants.
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because they harm our water 
quality and wildlife and cause both near-term and long-lasting negative impact on our local 
economy.  For invasive species, prevention is much simpler than the cure.  When I see the 
horrible condition of Androscoggin Lake and how much intensive work is required just to 
keep the invasive milfoil in check, I am terrified about the same thing happening in Flying 
Pond, where I have a camp, and Minnehonk Lake and Parker Pond, which are a short 
distance from my home in Vienna.  Invasive milfoil has been a problem in Great Pond for 
years and requires labor-intensive constant surveillance and removal.  
                                                                          
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread because 
it is simple, costs nothing, and takes only a few minutes of the boat owner’s time compared 
to the burden of trying to eradicate invasive plants once they get a foothold.  The courtesy 
boat inspections are a wonderful service and adding this simple step to their activities and 
instructions for boaters when the inspectors are not present will have a big impact.
Please vote to support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species spread.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Signed,
