Long (Great) Pond in Mount Desert is the top of a watershed that feeds at least three other ponds and a millstream, raceway, ﬁsh ladders and an iconic, well-known, frequently photographed pond-bridge-dam-ocean-cove scene. 
At the northern end of the Pond is a 300’ wide strip of land where the Pond’s End boat ramp and tiny park and swim area are located. In the winter, this little spot provides access to ﬁsh house launches and skaters. In the summer it is transformed into a paradise (or circus, depending on your point of view), that accommodates daily hundreds of boaters, swimmers, ﬁshers, day camps, photographers, tourists, boat and ﬂoat launchers, canoeists and kayakers, scientists, birders, a seaplane, and wildlife, such as ducks, geese, loons, eagles, alewives and more. The Pond is also the water source for the town of Southwest Harbor, and the location for hundreds of year-round and summer homes.
Somes-Meynell Wildlife Sanctuary conducts Courtesy Boat Inspections at the boat ramp from June to September. Beyond assuring, to the best of our ability, that boats, trailers, ﬁshing gear, etc., are free of invasive aquatic species, we take the opportunity to educate boat users on checking and cleaning their boats and gear. We also educate them and any visitors who are interested in the importance of keeping our waters clean and clear of invasive species.
Long Pond is no diﬀerent from hundreds of other Maine bodies of water that sustain life, generate income, provide beauty, and create lasting memories for generations of families. LD 92 is vital to helping organizations and communities protect, sustain and improve these critical resources.
