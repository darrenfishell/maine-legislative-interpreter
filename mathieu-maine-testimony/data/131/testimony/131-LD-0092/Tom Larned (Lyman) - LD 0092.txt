Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
Please support LD92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive Aquatic Plants.
Over ten years ago, I attended an all-day class run by Roberta Hill of Lake Stewards of Maine to learn 
how to identify invasive aquatic plants.  Since then, she has trained nineteen more of our volunteers to 
help survey Kennebunk Pond for invasive plants.
So, now, we have a well-trained cadre that surveys our waters every summer, looking to spot the first 
signs of an invasive infestation.
But, it would certainly be nice to know that every boat entering Kennebunk Pond has been through the 
“clean, drain, dry” process.
For the minimal hassle caused to boaters requiring them to remove drain plugs from bilges and ballast 
tanks, we would gain much protection for our beloved pristine Maine waters.
On behalf of the 174 members of the Kennebunk Pond Association, I ask for your support on LD92 as a 
smart way to further reduce invasive species spread.
