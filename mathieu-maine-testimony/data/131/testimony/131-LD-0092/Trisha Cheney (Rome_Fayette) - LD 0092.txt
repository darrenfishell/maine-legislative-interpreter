LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee,
My name is Trisha Cheney and I am a property owner on beautiful Parker Pond in 
Fayette.  I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation
of Invasive Aquatic Plants.
I am concerned about the risk of invasive species spread because they would devastate the 
fragile balance of the ecosystem in this beautiful lake and others around the state.
                                                                          
I support “clean, drain, dry” as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread because 
it will help to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic plants in our beautiful lakes and ponds. 
 Please vote to support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species﻿
spread.
I appreciate the opportunity to voice my support for this bill.
Signed,
Trisha Cheney
