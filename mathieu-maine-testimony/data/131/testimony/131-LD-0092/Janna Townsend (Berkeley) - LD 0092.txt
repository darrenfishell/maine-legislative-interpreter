LD 92
Dear Members of the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
I am asking for your support for LD 92: An Act to Minimize Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants.
As a LakeSmart evaluator and property owner on Messalonskee Lake, I am concerned
about the risk of invasive species because our lake association, Friends of 
Messalonskee, has spend tens of thousands of dollars annually to monitor and keep 
invasive milfoil at bay.
I support  "clean, drain, dry" as a smart approach to reduce invasive species spread 
because much of our milfoil has been transferred to the lake by boat. 
Please support LD 92 as a smart way to further reduce invasive species spread. 
Thank you,
Janna Townsend
