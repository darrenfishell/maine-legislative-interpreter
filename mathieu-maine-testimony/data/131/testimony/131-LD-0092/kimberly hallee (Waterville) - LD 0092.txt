LD 92
We support LD 92: drain all the water from your boat before you exit the boat ramp 
or parking lot from whence your boat came! These simple steps involve pulling a plug
or two, dumping a bucket or 'gettn'  the bilge pump to do it's  darn job! INVASIVE 
PLANT pieces can be  can floating in your hull, well or otherwise, once introduced 
into a water body fragments can quickly grow(like a cancer) and choke  the water, kill
our fish, and our livelihoods. As volunteer Courtesy Boat Inspectors we offer boat 
inspections of all boats coming and going from McGrath Pond and Salmon Lake. Our 
intent is to educate and provide prevention of Invasive Species such as Milfoil from 
entering our waters. As trained volunteer Invasive Plant Patrollers we monitor our 
lake shores for any invasive species. A few years ago Dave sighted a growth of 
Milfoil in Mill Stream in Norridgewock, As a trained Citizen Scientist he removed a 
plant fragment delivered it to 7 Lakes Alliance in Belgrade for identification. 7 LA 
sent the plant fragment on to the DEP for further confirmation and Preventative 
Action. Kim noted Milfoil in Messalonskee Stream at the Quarry Rd. Nature Trail 
carry in boat launch. Collaboration with WTVL Public Works/Parks & Rec .Director 
Matt Skehan and John McPhedran ME DEP Biologist for Invasive Aquatics Species 
Program  has resulted in 3 Signs being erected  along Waterville's stream shore launch
sites!  Warning - Remove all plants -it's the law!, Drain all water on land  Don't 
release live bait .DRAIN ALL BOAT WATER ON LAND- THIS NEEDS TO BE A 
LAW!!  Thank you. Kimberly and David Hallee 12 Gray Street WTVL, ME.
