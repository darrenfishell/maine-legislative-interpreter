LD 92
I am requesting your support of LD 92: An Act to Minimize the Propagation of Invasive 
Aquatic Plants.  
I am concerned with the risk of degradation in water quality of Maine lakes posed by 
non-native invasive aquatic plants.  The environmental, recreational and monetary value of 
our lakes is clearly known.  Preserving and protecting this resource is beneficial to all.  Once 
compromised, the cost of rescue and remediation of a lake is monumental.   The truth of the 
saying  "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is nowhere more obviously 
demonstrated.
Our current prevention strategy already requires boaters to clean their crafts and trailers 
between launchings.  Draining bilges and other water reservoirs is a simple additional step to 
make current prevention even more effective.  It takes very little time and costs absolutely 
nothing.  Most boaters are good stewards of our waters.  Once aware of this small additional 
action most will readily comply.  
LD 92 improves our current prevention practices without any additional burden to those using 
this precious resource.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important bill.
Respectfully submitted.
