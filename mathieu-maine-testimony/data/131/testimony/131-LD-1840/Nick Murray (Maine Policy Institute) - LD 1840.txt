Testimony
in
Support
of
LD
1840
,
“An
Act
to
Reform
the
State's
Administrative
and
Rule-making
Procedures”
Senator
Nangle,
Representative
Stover,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
State
and
Local
Government,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1840.
The
administrative
state
is
out
of
control.A
review
of
all
50
states’
small
business
climates
published
by
the
Pacific
Research
Institute
in
2015
ranked
Maine
5th-worst
in
the
nation.

Though
PRI
has
not
conducted
another
analysis
since
then,
the
regulatory
burden
on
Maine
people
has
not
gotten
better;
far
from
it.
An
analysis
of
the
2018
Code
of
Maine
Rules
(CMR)
found
that
it
contains
113,862
regulatory
restrictions
and
8.1
million
words.
Author
James
Broughel
noted
that
“it
would
take
an
individual
about
449
hours
–
or
more
than
11
weeks
–
to
read
the
entire
2018
CMR,
assuming
the
reader
spends
40
hours
per
week
reading
at
a
rate
of
300
words
per
minute.”

These
regulations
are
not
empty
words;
each
is
backed
by
the
force
of
law,
bearing
costs
for
those
tasked
with
complying
with
them.
The
child
care
industry
alone
faces
200
pages
of
state
regulations.
This
is
the
likely
reason
why,
despite
climbing
prices,
more
entrepreneurs
aren’t
entering
the
market.
With
LD
1840,
these
rules
would
have
been
scrutinized
every
five
years,
a
reasonable
timeframe
to
assess
effectiveness
in
the
real-world.
As
part
of
his
work
on
Maine,
Broughel
also
provided
a
framework
for
capping
onerous
rules
and
regulations
in
order
to
promote
an
environment
of
economic
growth,
including
a
yearly
review
of
agency
regulations
and
implementing
automatic
sunset
provisions.
We
are
pleased
to
see
similar
provisions
in
LD
1840
which
require
adopted
rules
to
automatically
expire
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
fiscal
year
following
filing.

LD
1840
also
allows
the
governor
oversight
in
the
adoption
or
amendment
of
executive
branch
rules,
so
that
he
or
she
may
veto
such
rules
if
deemed
to
be
too
onerous
on
Mainers.
The
bill
would
also
provide
better
guardrails
around
agency
use
of
routine
technical
rules,
which
do
not
require
legislative
oversight
or
approval.
In
this
way,
it
requires
emergency
rules
be
treated
as
“major
substantive,”
a
self-evident,
common-sense
reform
that
should
have
been
in
place
for
decades.
LD
1840
redefines
major
substantive
rules
as
those
which
will
result,
or
are
likely
to
result
in
an
annual
economic
effect
of
$50
million
or
more,
or
cause
significant
effects
on
economy
or
social
and
cultural
relations
among
citizens.
Perhaps
most
critically,
this
bill
targets
a
clear
threat
to
stable,
predictable
regulation:
what
is
known
as
the
Chevron
doctrine,
outlining
the
judicial
branch’s
deference
to
executive
branch
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
law.
This
doctrine
allows
for
unencumbered
government
overreach
into
all
areas
of
life.
Provisions
in
LD
1840
which
proscribe
that
court’s
shall
interpret
statutes
or
rules
de
novo
,
or
anew,
when
weighing
the
effects
of
agency
powers
over
individuals.
While
we
are
sympathetic
to
the
extra
effort
complying
with
this
bill
would
require
of
state
officials,
we
believe
it
is
absolutely
crucial
for
public
transparency
and
ensuring
the
highest
levels
of
accountability
in
how
the
government
interacts
with
the
people.
Because
agency
rules
carry
the
force
of
law,
they
should
be
subject
to
legislative
scrutiny.
The
standard
for
public
transparency
and
accountability
should
be
squared
with
those
who
are
subject
to
the
rules,
not
with
those
who
make
them.
Please
deem
LD
1840
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
restore
a
sensible
level
of
executive
branch
power
over
Mainers’
everyday
lives.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
