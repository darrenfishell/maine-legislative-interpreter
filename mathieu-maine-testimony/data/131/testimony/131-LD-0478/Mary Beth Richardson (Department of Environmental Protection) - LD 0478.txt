Southern Maine Regional Office, testifying neither for nor against L.D. 478, An Act to

a stabilization cover for the planting of native dune vegetation as long as the project 
meets all other applicable requirements for a permit by rule (PBR). The bill also 
establishes that the placement of allowable biodegradable materials within a coastal 
sand dune system in accordance with a permit by rule would not be considered a 
permanent structure. 
Generally, under current rules, no new permanent structures are allowed in the frontal 
dune portions of the coastal sand dune system, with some exceptions. Most, if not all, 
dune restoration projects occur in the frontal dune. To the extent that it is available, the 
Department encourages the use of native seaweed as the best option to trap sand and 
promote vegetative growth.‘ The bill defines “allowable biodegradable materials" to 
mean natural, plant-based biodegradable or compostable fabrics or erosion control 
blankets made from coir, jute, straw, polylactic acid polymers or other similar materials. 
Last year, the Department proposed, and the Board approved, a new section of PBR 
under Chapter 305 of the Natural Resources Protection Act that establishes criteria for 
dune construction, restoration, planting, and for beach nourishment. ln this bill, “native 
dune vegetation" is intended to mean dune plant species typically adapted to coastal 
sand dune systems including, but not limited to, American beach grass, virginiana rose, 
baybeny, beach pea, beach heather and pitch pine. This is consistent with the new 
section of PBR that was adopted last year. 
For these reasons, in general, the Department supports the concept behind this bill. We 
also recommend that wooden stakes be included specifically as an allowable 
biodegradable material. Wooden stakes may be necessary for securing some types of 
biodegradable cover to ensure that wind and wave action does not displace the cover, 
and will also degrade over time.

Chapter 355, the Coastal Sand Dune Rules, generally prohibits the removal of seaweed from the sand dune 
system unless it is used elsewhere within the dune system for dune restoration.

We also note that plans for utilizing some materials would need to be reviewed ona 
case-by-case basis. For example, in some cases, covering a restored area witha 
material such as erosion control mix, considered biodegradable and often used to 
stabilize construction sites, may result in a lack of vegetative growth if it is applied too 
thickly. 
Finally, the bill includes the use of polylactic acid polymers. Polylactic acid polymers 
are biodegradable materials derived from renewable biomass, typically from fermented 
plant starch such as corn, cassava, sugarcane or sugar beet pulp. While they have 
been used in some applications for general site stabilization, the Department has no 
experience with the use of these materials in dune restoration or construction projects. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony. I am available to answer any 
questions now or at the work session.
