RE: Written Testimony in Support of LD 478, An Act to Improve Coastal Sand Dune 
Restoration Projects 
Dear Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and distinguished committee members: 
Unfortunately as I will be unable to attend the hearing scheduled for Wednesday, March 8, 
2023, l respectfully submit my written testimony in support of LD 478. 
My family has owned property on Drakes island Beach (Lot 73B3; 375 Island Beach Road) in 
Wells, ME since 1979. When we decided to build in 1980, we were met with several 
challenges, the greatest of which was our inability to continue the existing seawall northward in 
front of our homes. At that time, we had to build back from the frontal dune on raised 
structures. 
Over the years, the entire beach has experienced significant changes, most importantly the 
erosion of the frontal dune system. As homeowners we, and many other concerned residents, 
have tried several times to seek guidance from the State of Maine in dealing with this issue. lt 
is our hope that LD 478, which incorporates new technologies for dealing with erosion, will aid 
in protecting, restoring, stabilizing not only Drakes Island Beach but all of Maineâ€™s beautiful 
beaches. 
Thank you for your consideration. l wholeheartedly support LD 478! 
Sincerely, 
Marilyn Higgins Forest
