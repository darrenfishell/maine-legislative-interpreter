gates.melissa@rocketmail.com | 207.706.6378 March 8, 2023  Greetings Chair Brenner, Chair Gramlich, and Distinguished Members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee:  I greatly appreciate the intent behind LD478, An Act to Improve Coastal Sand Dune Restoration Projects,1 and would enthusiastically support the bill’s advancement if an amendment to strike the allowance of polylactic acid (PLA) polymers is entertained as follows:  @line 12: …coir, jute, straw, polylactic acid polymers or other similar materials; @line 23: …control blankets made from coir, jute, straw, polylactic acid polymers or other similar  While PLA does biodegrade in certain controlled environments, it does so very slowly,2 and as it decomposes, it releases methane,3 which has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide for the first 20 years it is in our atmosphere. Unfortunately, PLA does not biodegrade in the marine environment.4 This makes PLA and plastics, in general, unsuitable materials for use in dune restoration and other marine projects, as wave energy, winds, and storm surge will over time deplete the integrity of the PLA and wear it down into microplastics. Microplastics then pollute the watershed and beach, often winding up in sea creatures and then in people and animals who eat sea creatures.5 Fortunately, there are many viable, accessible, functional, affordable, non-plastic and truly marine degradable materials available for sand and vegetation retention in dune                                                         1 https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0295&item=1&snum=131 2 https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/13/21/4994 3 https://bioplasticsnews.com/2020/03/14/pla-problems/ 4 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722019532 5 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01096-w

These natural materials are already proposed for inclusion in LD478 and are widely used to good and intended effect by other states in our region.6 Please consider amending LD478 to strike the allowance of PLA.
