Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
honorable
members
of
the
Environment
and
Natural
Resources
Committee,
I
am
Gus
La
Casse,
and
I
am
a
fourth-year
University
of
Maine
student
from
T renton.
Thank
you
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1009:
An
Act
Regarding
the
Reduction
and
Recycling
of
Food
W aste.
Maine
has
a
special
relationship
to
food.
From
having
a
strong
tradition
of
regional
food
ways
and
being
known
around
the
world
for
the
food
we
produce,
to
having
a
constitutional
right
to
it,
this
bill
provides
Maine
the
opportunity
to
ensure
that
we
use
food
to
nourish
our
food
insecure
neighbors,
and
to
ensure
that
waste
is
disposed
of
properly .
At
a
young
age,
my
family
and
I
would
volunteer
for
the
annual
Spring
Fest,
an
event
put
on
by
Sr .
Lucille
MacDonald
and
the
Emmaus
Shelter
in
Ellsworth.
Although
I
was
young
at
the
time,
this
experience
implanted
the
importance
of
food
in
communities,
food
security .
It
is
an
incredible
honor
and
duty
to
advocate
to
ensure
that
our
neighbors
are
fed.
In
this
brief
testimony ,
I
would
like
to
focus
on
two
reasons
why
this
bill
deserves
passage;
its
impact
on
food
insecurity
in
Maine,
and
its
impact
on
our
environment.
The
timeliness
of
this
bill
cannot
be
overstated.
One
in
six
Maine
residents
are
food
insecure,
and
over
100,000
Mainers
have
been
impacted
by
the
recent
reduction
of
SNAP
benefits,
causing
an
increase
in
demand
at
food
pantries
around
the
State.
LD
1009
does
the
important
work
of
ensuring
that
surplus
food
makes
its
way
to
food
pantries,
and
that
Maine
puts
a
greater
emphasis
on
food
rescue
in
future
years.
The
environmental
impact
of
food
waste
on
Maine
also
deserves
consideration.
A
quarter
of
the
waste
that
creates
American
landfills
is
food,
the
biggest
contributor
to
Maine
landfills
is
food.
Food
waste
is
also
responsible
for
eight
percent
of
global
emissions
of
greenhouse
gases,
and
when
put
into
landfills
generates
methane,
a
greenhouse
gas
that
is
twenty-five
times
more
potent
than
carbon
dioxide.
This
bill
would
not
only
implement
a
regime
that
would
stop
food
waste
ending
up
in
landfills,
but
would
also
ensure
anaerobic
digestion
is
the
last
possible
resort
for
food
waste.
More
pointedly ,
this
would
ensure
that
the
breakdown
of
food
waste
would
see
produce
biogas,
digestate,
or
water
as
opposed
to
methane.
In
the
rollout
of
LD
1009:
An
Act
Regarding
the
Reduction
and
Recycling
of
Food
W aste
,
responsibility
will
be
required
of
those
who
produce
the
most
food
scraps,
acknowledging
that
those
who
have
the
means
to
adequately
deal
with
food
scraps
on
a
lar ge
scale
should
be
the
first
to
do
so.
If
this
bill
passes,
Maine
would
become
one
of
ten
states
in
the
country
to
ensure
that
food
waste
and
surplus
food
does
not
end
up
in
landfills,
further
demonstrate
our
commitment
to
a
clean
and
prosperous
future,
and
advocate
for
the
best
interests
of
all
Mainers.
As
well,
T renton
can
be
proud
to
see
that
our
voices
in
Augusta
are
ardent
supporters
of
protecting
Maineâ€™ s
environmental
and
food
security .
I
ur ge
this
honorable
committee
to
support
the
passage
of
LD
1009:
An
Act
Regarding
the
Reduction
and
Recycling
of
Food
W aste.
