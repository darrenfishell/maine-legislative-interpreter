Testimony of the Maine Municipal Association
In Neither For Nor Against
LD 1009 – An Act Regarding the Reduction and Recycling of Food Waste

________________________________________________________________________________
Sen. Brenner, Rep. Gramlich and distinguished members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham and I submitting placeholder testimony neither for 
nor against, LD 1009, An Act Regarding the Reduction and Recycling of Food Waste, on behalf of the 
Maine Municipal Association, which represents the interests of municipal government before the 
Legislature. The positions of the Association are established by our 70-member Legislative Policy 
Committee (LPC), met remotely yesterday but will require a review of the bill by the larger group next 
week to confirm a position. 
While officials believe the composting of food scraps is a laudable goal, they also recognize that 
the task requires additional management that is not always possible to be provided uniformly. The best 
tools to address this in many communities is to promote single household composting where possible and 
well managed, and to allow the growing number of food scrap collection efforts have developed 
commercially. These activities remove a significant amount of food waste from the municipally managed 
stream.
Municipal officials are most concerned about the provision in the bill that requires a municipal 
solid waste management plan for food scraps that require application for all residents, and additionally 
prohibits residents from opting out of municipally provided solid waste management. In more densely 
populated areas, multi-unit dwellings are not included in municipal solid waste services and must procure 
those services privately. The density and trash needs of those buildings is required at a great rate than 
municipal services can feasibly meet and the volume frequently requires dedicated truck transport of the 
waste. The prohibition of those high-density units from opting out of municipal solid waste management 
services would be a significant burden on municipalities. 
Additionally, the public collection of food scraps presents significant challenges for public waste 
containers. Co-locating both trash and food scraps in the same area in separate largely unmonitored 
containers will cause significant extra operational tasks for the inevitable “tragedy of the commons” that 
already occurs in these locations. 
Rather than mandating public locations to have both containers located in the same space, a better 
option would be to allow the municipalities to deem where such facilities make sense in public spaces and 
where they can be best maintained and monitored. 
If the committee has not voted on this bill prior to the full LPC has an opportunity to review 
potential additional consequences, I will submit testimony at that time. We hope that you will consider 
these initial concerns in the interim.
