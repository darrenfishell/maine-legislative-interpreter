TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO  
 
L.D. 1009  
 
AN ACT REGARDING THE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING OF FOOD WASTE  
 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Committee on Environment and Natural 
Resources, I am Steven Bailey , executive director of Maine School Management Association, testifying on 
behal f of the legislative committees of  the Maine School Boards Association and Maine School 
Superintendents Association , in opposition to L.D. 1009.  
 
This proposed legislation is very cumbersome and prescriptive for schools, and they do not have t he staff or 
the room  to monitor this process.  
 
We are concerned that while the requirements of the bill would be phased in over 5 years, not all or even 
many school districts are prepared to eliminate all food scraps without a substantial change in operati ons. 
 
Our suggestion is that rather than mandate a process, there should be voluntary efforts to reduce food waste 
and scraps. O ut of those efforts , best practices will surface , and those practices will be more cost effective.  
 
One solution wonâ€™t fit all bec ause food school operations differ based on the number of students being served.  
What will work is learning from the field.
