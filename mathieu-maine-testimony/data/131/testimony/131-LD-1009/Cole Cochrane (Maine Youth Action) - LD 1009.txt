Senator
Brenner ,
Representative
Gramlich,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Environment
and
Natural
Resources
Committee.
My
name
is
Cole
Cochrane,
I
am
a
senior
at
Thornton
Academy
in
Saco,
and
I
am
here
on
behalf
of
Maine
Y outh
Action,
a
statewide
youth
advocacy
group
that
represents
hundreds
of
young
Mainers
from
varying
backgrounds
I
have
come
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1009,
An
Act
Regarding
the
Reduction
and
Recycling
of
Food
W aste.
My
original
intention
today
was
only
to
testify
on
LD
928,
the
Pine
T ree
Amendment,
but
when
Senator
Brenner
mentioned
what
else
was
on
the
agenda,
LD
1009
certainly
caught
my
attention.
I
took
some
time
to
review
the
bill
text
and
just
wrote
up
this
testimony ,
so
my
remarks
are
relatively
brief.
As
we
respond
to
the
climate
crisis,
it
is
not
simply
about
how
to
mitigate
its
ef fects
and
ensure
our
future
existence,
though
I
would
say
that
it
is
important,
it
also
brings
to
light
fundamental
flaws
in
our
communities
and
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
correct
them
in
order
to
promote
sustainability .
I
would
say
that
food
consumption
directly
relates
to
this
sentiment.
Therefore,
I
find
Representative
Zeigler ’ s
bill
to
be
opportune
and
the
appropriate
action
needed
to
make
our
food
consumption
aligned
with
what
our
communities
need
to
see.
I
see
changes
in
language
such
as
prohibiting
the
disposal
of
surplus
food;
prioritizing
the
repurpose
of
food
scraps
for
agricultural
use;
and
directing
the
use
of
food
scraps
towards
composting
without
sludge.
All
of
these
changes
are
exactly
what
our
youth
are
looking
for -
changes
aiming
to
address
fundamental
flaws
in
our
communities
and
to
create
a
more
sustainable
system.
I
think
this
work
ought
to
be

advanced
by
the
committee
and
I
ur ge
a
majority
report
of
“ought
to
pass”
on
LD
1009.
Thank
you.
