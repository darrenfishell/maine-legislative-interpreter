Written Testimony of Kathryn Vezina  
 To Committee on Health and Human Services 
In Opposition to LD 183, An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Program into Municipal General Assistance 
 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services.  I am Kathryn Vezina, I live in Portland, and I bring to you today testimony in 
opposition to LD 183, An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families Program into Municipal General Assistance. I submit this testimony on behalf of the Maine 
Unitarian Universalist State Advocacy Network, also known as MUUSAN.  MUUSAN is statewide 
advocacy and public policy network anchored in Unitarian Universalist faith and animated by UU 
principles.   
 
Unitarian Universalism calls us to change oppressive policies and structures to those that recognize 
the inherent worth and dignity of each person and build justice, equity and compassion in human 
relations.  We are speaking in opposition to LD 183 because it is counter to our efforts to move 
toward a more just society.   
 
As people of faith, we see municipal general assistance as the very minimal floor that offers a 
means of survival for people who have no other way to meet their basic human needs.  If LD 183 
were to pass, this minimal lifeline would be cut off for anyone who has, for any reason, exhausted 
benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Depriving people of 
resources to survive, as LD 183 would do, is deeply abhorrent to our belief that every person is 
worthy and deserves respect.  
 
On behalf of MUUSAN, we strongly urge a vote of Ought Not to Pass on LD 183.  Thank you.
