Chart Baldaccr, Chalr Meyer, Members of the Commrttee on Health and Human Servrces. 
My name 1s Tobin W1111amson I 11ve in Lewrston and I am the Advocacy Manager w1th the 
Mame Imm1grants ’ Rrghts Coal1t1on (MIRC), a statewrde network of almost 100 member 
orgamzatrons workmg to enhance the hves of Ma1ne’s rmmrgrant commumtres MIRC works to 
advance systemrc changes 1n Mame through collaboratlve advocacy to ensure that V0lC6S of the 
state’s large, d1verse, and growmg rmmrgrant commumtres are heard 
As I recently told Mame Pubhc, “th1s senes of bllls would be catastrophrc to the asylum seeker 
commumty It would be really problematrc 1f people are not able to get any sort of assrstance 
whlle they are legally prohlblted from workmg at the federal level” 
Beheve me, I know the work author1zat1on challenge for asylum seekers 1s problematrc We are 
grateful that Mame’s delegatron 1s lead1ng at a natronal level for posltrve changes, wlth 
Congresswoman Pmgree, Senator Colhns, and Senator Kmg consrstently mtroducmg the Asylum 
Seeker Work Authonzatron Act I am part of a small workmg group of natronal rmmlgratron 
pohcy advocates that has meetmgs every smgle week w1th d1fferentU.S Congresslonal pohcy 
staff advocat1ng for changes to the current polrcy 
But unt1l those changes occur, these ﬁve b1lls would be devastatmg to thousands of people If 
enacted, adults, chrldren, and ent1re famrhes would lose thelr ab1l1ty to pay for housmg, lose thelr 
ab1l1ty to pay for food, lose therr ab111ty to pay for transportatron, you name 1t 
People do not come to Mame for clothlng donatrons or prepackaged meals They come to 
prov1de safety, security, and stab1l1ty for the1r fam1l1es They do not want to be rehant on General 
Assrstance or chantable contrlbutrons to survrve, they want to work and make a successful hfe 
for themselves But as long as federal 1mm1grat1on pol1cy proh1b1ts them from domg so, the 
General Asslstance program 1s what 1s preventmg a full-ﬂedged humamtanan cr1s1s 
Moreover, I cannot emphas1ze enough the need for these ﬁve harmful b1lls to not pass Thank 
you very much for your conslderatlon of th1s 1mportant 1ssue
