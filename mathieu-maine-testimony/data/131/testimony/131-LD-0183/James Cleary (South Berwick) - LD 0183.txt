LD 183
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 183.
This bill provides reasonable limits on general assistance benefits. Without such 
limits these programs will obviously be more susceptible to Fraud and Abuse. This 
puts an undue burden on taxpayers while rewarding fraudsters and disincentivizing 
personal growth and development through employment. It is right to provide 
assistance to our neighbors in need, in their time of need.  The knowledge of a 
deadline for expiring assistance will ensure that the beneficiaries of this program will 
seek away off of it.
Please deem LD 183 in “Ought To Pass” to ensure that general assistance is provided 
in a way that will help people and not make them dependent and stunt their personal 
growth  at the expense of the taxpayer.
