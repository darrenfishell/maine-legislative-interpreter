Re:  LD 183 – An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program 
into Municipal General Assistance Programs  
 
Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services:  
 
This letter is to provide informati on regarding LD 183, An Act to Incorporate Time Limits on the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families Program into Municipal General Assistance Programs . The proposed 
legislation seeks to  limit eligibility to General Assistance benefits for any individual who has exhausted the 
60-month lifetime limit on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.  
 
The Department strives to ensure that Maine children grow up in safe, healthy, and supportive environments, 
allowing them to thrive throughout th eir lives; that all adults have opportunity to work, live with 
independence, and have good health; and that older Mainers live with dignity in the place that balances their 
needs and preferences.  
 
This bill makes an individual who has exhausted TANF benefits ineligible for General Assistance for a 
period of 5 years following the end of the applicant’s 60th month of TANF issuance. If passed, this bill will 
prevent the General Assistance program from serving as the safety net  program it is intended to be – 
providing support when families have no other avenue in emergency  or dire  situations.  
 
The Department opposes this bill due to the negative impact it would have on children , parents and older 
Mainer s. This bill  will create hardship for those who need assistance the most and does not account for the 
nuance of individual client’s immediate needs  and situations.  Current high costs for food and housing are at a 
critical level putting Maine’s most vulnera ble at risk. Cutting back on existing resources that will help meet 
the basic needs of Mainers at a time when the state is building back from a global  public health emergency is 
not in the best interests for the State.  
 
DHHS is committed to working with stakeholders to review and make recommendations for improving the 
General Assistance program. We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill 
going forward.
 
Sincerely,  
 
Anthony Pelotte, Director   
Office for Family Indepen dence
