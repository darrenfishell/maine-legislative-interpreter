(https://umaine.edu/religious-studies/interreligious-calendar/ ). Since then, faculty, committees, and
student groups have consulted the interreligious calendar to schedule their events. While I do not
have statistical data to share, anecdotally, we have seen a significant reduction in vital events in
university life being scheduled during major holidays.
Finally, I believe that insensitivities of this sort and the inequalities they breed when members of
minority traditions are forced to choose between their religion and participating in public life are
caused by carelessness and ignorance. If ignorance is the source of the problem, as I believe it is,
then the solution is to educate ourselves and the citizenry of the State of Maine. A State Calendar
would create greater awareness of the religious diversity in our State and serve as a resource to help
all of us be better neighbors to each other. Therefore, I ask you to support the Resolve to Establish
the Committee to Study the Creation of a State Calendar.
Sincerely,
Dr. Derek A. Michaud
