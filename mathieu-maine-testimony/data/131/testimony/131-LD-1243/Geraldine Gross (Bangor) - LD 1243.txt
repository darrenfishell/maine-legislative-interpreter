LD 1243
My name is Geraldine Gross, a resident of Bangor, and I wish to submit testimony in 
favor of LD 1243: Resolve to Establish the Committee to Study the Creation of a 
State Calendar.  When my children were in school, we frequently ran into conflicts 
between Jewish holidays and school events.  Primarily, Rosh Hashanah and Yom 
Kippur, which occur in the fall, often conflicted with important school events, such as
photo day, standardized testing, open houses, and athletic events.  I began to meet 
annually with the principal of my children's school or someone from the downtown 
admin, and I was received respectfully, but calendars are set early and often there was
little that could be done.  A state calendar would be a wonderful idea!  It may take 
some work to implement, but I believe it would save conflicts and scrambling later 
on.
