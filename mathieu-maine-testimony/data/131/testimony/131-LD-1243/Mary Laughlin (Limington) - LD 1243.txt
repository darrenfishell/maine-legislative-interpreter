Dear Members of the Committee on State and Local Government,
My name is Mary Laughlin and I live in Limington. 
As I understand this bill, it seems reasonable in its goal of creating a committee to 
identify religious holidays for the purpose of incorporating them into a state calendar.
Please vote ought to pass.
Thank you.
Mary Laughlin
