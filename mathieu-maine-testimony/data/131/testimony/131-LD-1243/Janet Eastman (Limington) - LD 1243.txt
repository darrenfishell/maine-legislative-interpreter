I am writing in support of this bill.  Over the years I have inadvertently schedule 
events with no awareness of other groups' religious calendar.  I am not proud of that 
AND I have learned.  By creating a State calendar it will support our friends from all 
different faiths and honor their religious and holy days.  All calendars record 
Christian holidays.  It is time (in fact overdue) to recognize publicly the holidays of 
all faiths.
