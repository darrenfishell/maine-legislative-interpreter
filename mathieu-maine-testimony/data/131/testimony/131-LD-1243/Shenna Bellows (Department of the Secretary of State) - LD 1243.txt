JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON STATE AND LOCAL 
Testimony Provided by Shenna Bellows, Secretarjy of State 
In support of 
L.D. 1243 “A Resolve, to Establish the Committee to Study the Creation of a State Calendar ” 
April 11, 2023 
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on State and 
Local Government. I am Secretary of State Shenna Bellows. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
before you today in support of L.D. 1243. 
We appreciate the sponsor bringing this bill forward and naming us in the committee. As a department 
that sees and interacts with a large majority of our state’s population on a daily basis, we know the 
people of Maine come from all sorts of backgrounds, cultures, religions, and beliefs. Therefore, we 
support this bill and urge the state to consider altering the current state holiday schedule to make it 
more inclusive of groups who hold nontraditional religions and backgrounds. 
Other states have already incorporated additional cultural and religious holidays. For example, the 
State of Texas’s holiday calendar includes Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah; Connecticut observes 
Good Friday; and California celebrates Ceasar Chavez Day. 
We believe in — and we think this committee can agree with — the principle that all members of the 
public should have the opportunity to participate and interact with their government and updating the 
state holiday calendar would ultimately prevent any exclusion from happening. 
For these reasons, we are in support of this bill. I am happy to answer any questions or get additional 
information to the Committee ahead of the work session. Thank you.
