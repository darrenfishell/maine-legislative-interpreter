LD 1243
To Senators Ann Matlack, Chair, Joe Baldacci,Chair, Ned Claxton, Mark Bryant, 
Donna Doore, Lynn Copeland, and Sean Paulhus, My name is Asherah Cinnamon, I 
have lived in Limington for over 15 years and for 2 decades before that in South 
Portland, Portland, and Brewer. LD 1243 asks you to allow inquiry into creating a 
State Calendar that respects all the religions of Maine residents. 
When a government recognizes only Christian Holidays in setting its calendar for 
events, deciding when governmental bodies meet, including when testimony on 
legislation is heard, it is saying that other religions and the people who believe in 
them are inferior and unimportant. THAT is unAmerican! 
Please VOTE  YES on LD 1243
Our country was founded on Religious Freedom. A State Calendar could be used by 
all public or private institutions, by individuals and business owners, to show respect 
for our citizens and future citizens, and even our diverse group of legislators. Please 
lead the way.
I was a child immigrant to the USA. I became a US Citizen at the age of 9. I  am 
Jewish, the Child of Survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and actually a survivor myself, 
in utero at the time. I am active in the Jewish community and my husband is a 
Christian, active in his Church. If we can get along, surely you can do this much for 
us. You can lead the way for all Mainers to be welcome in their homes, schools, and 
places of work.
Thank you for your important, but often under-appreciated, service to the State of 
Maine. Be well.
Asherah
