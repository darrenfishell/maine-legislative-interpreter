LD 1243
Dear Senate Chair Nangle, House Chair Stover, and Members of the Committee on 
State and Local Government,
My name is Michael Alpert and I am a resident of Bangor. I am here to support LD 
1243: Resolve to Establish the Committee to Study the Creation of a State Calendar. 
This bill will resolve a problem that religious minorities in this state have faced for 
many years. I am a Jewish member of Congregation Beth Israel and Congregation 
Beth El. Both Congregations are located in Bangor. I attend religious services on a 
regular basis and during Jewish holidays. I also serve as the president of the Greater 
Bangor Area Branch NAACP. 
In our great country, justice means justice for all. Injustice for minorities of any 
category is unacceptable. The basis of justice is respect for individuals without 
exception. Making people choose between their religious practice and their civic 
obligations is unjust and unnecessary. What is being proposed in LD1243 is not 
complicated or burdensome. The schedule of hearings and other events in state 
government should allow lawmakers and others to exercise the religious freedom 
guaranteed by our country’s laws and constitution and by our state’s laws and 
constitution.There is no good reason to oppose this legislation and every reason to 
support it. Please approve LD 1243 for the sake of all Maine citizens. 
Thank you for your attention.
