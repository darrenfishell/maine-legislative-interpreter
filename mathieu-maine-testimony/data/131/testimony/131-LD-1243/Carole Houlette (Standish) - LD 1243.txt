LD 1243
Dear Committee Members: 
My name is Carole Houlette and I live in Standish, Maine. I am writing in support of 
LD 1243: Resolve to Establish the Committee to Study the Creation of a State 
Calendar. 
We are a country and state of many faiths and creating a State Calendar that would 
honor those many faiths is a step in the right direction of creating religious respect for
all Maine constituents.
Sincerely,
Carole Houlette
