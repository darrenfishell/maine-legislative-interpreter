Testimony of Newell Augur 
Director 
Maine Beverage Association 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources 
In Opposition t o LD 1645, An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste 
May 15, 2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Brenne R r, epresentative Gramlich and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Environmental and Natural Resource s, my name is Newell Augur I ama 
resident of Yarmouth and a lawyer with Pierce Atwood I represent the members of the Maine 
Beverage Association, your local distribut ors of a variety of refreshing products includ d 
soda, soda, jUIC€S, spoits dri k ing iet 
n s and, increasingly, water I am here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1645, An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste 
As written, this bill would prohibit would seriously disrupt our beverage production and 
distribution Section I the st , ec ion that spells out the various types of packaging that would be 
prohibited, includes sub-section (6) which states “ last p ic packaging that is composed wholly or 
partially of polyethylene terephthalate and is manufactured using antimony or cobalt asa 
processing aid or additive ” Nearly all of the plastic bottles we sell are made of ol th 
terephthalate — or PET A d ° p ye ylene 
n 80-90 A» of that PET is produced using antimony or cobalt asa 
catalyst In addition, some of our packaging that is oa 
S p que would be prohibited by language in 
ection I (2) 
Not all plastic is the same Unlike many other forms of plastic which are not recyclable, PET IS 
recyclable In fact, PET is the most recycled plastic wo Idd 
b r WI e Plastic bottles and the caps sold 
y our companies are 100% recyclable Od ur in ustry IS one of the few that has specifically 
designed nearly all of our packaging to that standard
PET is a light and strong material lt’s in high demand because it can easily be remade into new 
plastic bottles and many other everyday products When we get our plastic bottles back, they 
can be used to make new bottles as designed or remade into something new, and not end up in 
oceans, rivers, beaches and landfills PET is not a single-use plastic, and our bottles are not 
single use plastic 
In 2018 the parent companies of the Maine Beverage Association developed an innovative 
metric for tracking the use and impact of plastic bottles At the moment, it's focused on PET 
bottles and consists of both production data and data on the fate of bottles in the environment 
The metric was developed along with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure it is based on sound 
principles The footprint is consistent with WWF’s ReSource Plastic Footprint Tracker and 
represents a sector-specific expansion of this measurement framework lt is a composite of 
indicators that look at how containers are produced and what their fate is in the environment 
after use to create an index that can be tracked over time The four indicators that make up the 
footprint index are 
1 Alternatives to virgin PET — post-consumer recycled PET (RPET) and PET from 
plant[1]based sources (BPET) replace PET from petroleum (virgin resin), reducing the 
environmental impact of bottle production The goal is to drive down the share of virgin 
resin in the average bottle sold 
2 Recyclability guidelines The Association of Plastics Recyclers has established Preferred 
for Recycling guidelines for PET bottles and our goal IS to reach 100 percent compliance 
with those guidelines, eliminating those bottles from our portfolio which have components 
that may interfere with the recycling process 
3 Recycling rate for PET ABA calculates a recycling rate for PET refreshment beverage 
bottles sold in the US As the rate increases, the amount of PET disposed will decrease 
4 PET bottles in the environment PET bottles are among the many products found 
mismanaged in the environment, which we generically call litter The indicator tracks the 
prevalence of PET beverage bottles in litter 
Between 2018 and 2020, the industry ’s plastic footprint index declined 1 6 percent from the 
initial 2018 baseline This is despite a drop in the recycling rate, owing in large part to the impact 
of the pandemic on recycling and bottle redemption The decrease was driven by an increase in 
the share of containers that meet preferred for recycling guidelines from 85% to 89% anda 
reduction in the share of virgin resin in the average bottle from 91% to 89% The member 
companies have committed to continue collecting the data to calculate the footprint on a regular 
basis, with the goal of continuing to reduce the plastic footprint 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify
