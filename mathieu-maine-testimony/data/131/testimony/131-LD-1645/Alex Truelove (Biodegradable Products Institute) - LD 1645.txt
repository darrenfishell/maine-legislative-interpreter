BPI supports the goal to reduce plastic packaging waste and a transition to reusable, 
recyclable and compostable products. However, the definition for “compostable” 
packaging provided would create a bad precedent because it lacks measurable goals 
and ignores scientific standards developed by experts across the industry.  
Unlike this bill, states across the U.S. and countries across the world require 
compostable packaging to adhere to standard specifications such as ASTM D6400 
and ASTM D6868, which ensure that products not only disintegrate a described here, 
but also biodegrade, meaning they break down at a molecular level.  
Many also require verification from an independent third party like BPI, though 
others exist. We ensure that products are tested for toxins, PFAS, are clearly labeled, 
and are associated with food or organic waste to ensure they actually help. 
We request that the definition of “compostable” in the bill be amended to include 
ASTM standards and require third party verification. We’d be happy to provide 
example language, and would support the bill if amended so.
