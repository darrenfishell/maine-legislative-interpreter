V Toxic-Free Tomorrow 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee My name is Sarah Woodbury. l am the director of advocacy for Defend 
Our Health Defend Our Hea}th’s mission is‘to make sure that everyone has equal access to, 
safe food and drinking water, healthy homes, and products that are toxic-free and climate- 
friendly I am here to testify in support of LD 1645 “An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste"
l 
LD 1645 will phase out some of the most problematic plastic packaging The bill focuses ona 
small fraction of plastic packaging that industry agrees we need to move away from to improve 
recycling These packaging items are not recyclable, compostable, or reusable, and include 
Polystyrene plastic, including those annoying polystyrene foam peanuts; 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic, which Nestlé and others are phasing out, 
A few other types of plastics known to impair the quality of recycled plastics; and 
Two cancer-causing additives in PET plastic for which there are safer alternatives 
The bill exempts disposable food service containers restricted by existing Maine law and 
polystyrene foam coolers used to transport seafood. 
Problematic plastic packaging impairs recycling and poilutes the environment' 
Plastic packaging that is not recyclable or compostable adds to the waste stream and interferes 
with recycling efforts. Toxic additives like cobalt and antimony leach out of some plastic 
packaging, polluting the environment and exposing consumers to cancer-causing chemicals. 
We have all seen the stories about the Ohio train derailment which dumped thousands of 
gallons of toxic chemicals in the community of East Palestine, Ohio, contaminating their air, 
drinking water and soil 1 
This toxic chemical was vinyl chloride, which is used to make PVC 
plastic packaging that would be phased out by this bill These types of toxic chemicals should 
not be utilized in products that we are exposed to every day We need to move away from uses 
of these plastics to protect our health and environment 
The market has begun to move - a recently negotiated stakeholder agreement aims to 
eliminate several types of problematic or unnecessary plastics in packaging by 2025 
The U.S. Plastics Pact is comprised of over 850 industry leaders, governments, and nonproﬁts, 
all united in supporting ways to increase plastic recycling and create a more circular plastic 
economy. After months of negotiations, in January 2022 they announced a new commitment to 
move industry away from some of the more problematic plastic packaging This is plastic

packaging that can’t be recycled, composted, or reused While we appreciate this negotiated 
agreement, it remains voluntary Industry is not required to do anything LD 1645 would put part 
of this agreement into law to make sure that industry follows through on their promises 
Maine joins other policy leaders in phasing out unnecessary or problematic plastics 
Maine has been a leader in banning uses of unnecessary and problematic plastic including 
plastic bags, plastic balloon releases, and polystyrene single-use food containers (with some 
exceptions) LD 1645 will help us continue this leadership But we will not be alone Two 
Califomia Assembly committees recently passed AB 1290, which is very similar legislation to LD 
1645, and the California bill is expected to head to the Senate soon Oregon’s Govemor 
recently signed legislation (SB 543) to ban the use of polystyrene foam peanuts in packaging ln 
fact, 19 states are working on legislation to eliminate problematic chemicals and plastics/ 
including AK, AZ, CA, CT, GA, Hl, lA, ME, MA, Ml, MN, NH, NJ, NY, OR, Rl, TN, VT, and WV. 
Policy action is needed - recycling alone can’t solve the growing plastics waste crisis 
We keep hearing that the solution to the plastics problem is recycling but the truth is that isn’t 
happening Only about 6% of plastic waste gets recycledz while the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development Pl'0]6C’IS that plastic production will triple by the year 2060 unless 
policy action is wken 3 That's bad for our environment, our climate and bad for our health. 
You will hear from opponents that this legislation isn’t necessary because Maine has already 
passed an extended producer responsibility bill (EPR) to raise funds to promote recycling. ‘lio be 
clear, we are 100% in support of Maine's EPR law We testified in support This bill does not 
interfere with that process at all This is a complementary policy that will completely remove a~ 
few problematic plastics from the waste stream. The EPR law will still function as intended to 
assess fees on packaging and channel those resources into stronger recycling programs. 
Safer alternatives to plastic packaging, such as forest products, are widely available 
Source reduction IS the solution We need to move away from uses of plastic wherever we can 
LD 1645 starts small by phasing out just a few of the most problematic plastic packaging items 
The focus is on plastic packaging that industry has said that it does not need and for which 
there are safer alternatives going forward (See the attachment for examples of alternatives ) 
CONCLUSION: Passage of LD 1645 will keep problematic plastics out of our waste stream and 
protect consumer health by banning toxic chemicals like antimony and colbalt This is an 
important step for both the health and environment of all Mainers We urge the committee to 
pass LD 1645 Thank you
