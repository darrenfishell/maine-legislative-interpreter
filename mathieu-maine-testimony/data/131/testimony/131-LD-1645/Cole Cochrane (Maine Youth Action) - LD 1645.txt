From Cole Cochrane, Ma1ne Youth Act1on 
Re Test1mony 1n Support of LD 1645, An Act to Reduce Plast1c Packag1ng 
Waste 
Senator Brenner, Representatrve Gramhch, and the honorable members of the Envlromnent and 
Natural Resources C0mm1ttee My name 1s Cole Cochrane, I am a senlor at Thornton Academy 
1n Saco, and I am here on behalf of Ma1ne Youth Actron, a statewlde youth advocacy group that 
represents hundreds of young Ma1ners on cr1t1cal 1ssues fac1ng my generat1on Ma1ne Youth 
Act1on 1s testlfylng 1n support of LD 1645 , An Act to Reduce Plast1c Packaglng Waste 
Young Malners have repeatedly expressed to th1s commlttee the seventy of the chmate cr1s1s My 
generat1on W111 be fac1ng the brunt of 1t and W111 have to deal w1th the devastat1ng effects all 
throughout our adulthoods, ranglng from coastal erosron to 1ntens1ﬁed natural dlsasters and even 
severe resource shortages, such as water There 1s so much u11certa1nty that werghs on our m1nds, 
especlally when We plan for college, careers, and fam1l1es 
A contr1butor to the clunate cr1s1s that we must address urgently and transformat1vely are 
plast1cs Over 99% of plastlcs are made from foss1l fuels (1), and contlnue to em1t greenhouse 
gasses (GHG) at every stage of 1ts l1fecycle Plastlc pollutron accounts for roughly 4 5% of 
global GHG em1ss1ons and 1s on track to be respons1ble for 20% of 011 consumpt1on by 2050 (2) 
Demand for plast1c cont1nues to rncrease, whlch exacerbates the cl1mate cr1s1s In fact, em1ss1ons 
are expected to 1ncrease to 49 m1ll1on metrlc tons by 2030 (3) It 1s not sustamable to meet th1s 
demand and 1t W111 weaken our cllmate act1on response, a response that leg1s1ators, sc1ent1sts, and 
advocates have worked d1l1gently on Furthermore, the excess1ve use of plast1c damages the 
health and wellbemg of our commun1t1es It perpetuates throughout our ex1stence by pollut1ng 
our a1r and water, as well as exposlng commun1t1es to toX1c chemlcals durlng 1ts product1on and 
decomposltlon process Thls d1sproport1onately affects rac1al m1nor1t1es and low mcome
communltres Overall, 1t 1s clear that srngle use plastlc can not be a part of Ma1ne’s future and we 
must take measures to phase 1t out LD 1645 1s a necessary step 1n the r1ghtd1rect1on The b1ll 
phases out polystyrene, wh1ch can be found 1n foam peanuts, noodles and blocks It also phases 
out v1nyl, wh1ch 1s used to pack clothmg xtems or even be the plastlc sleeves around bottles 
These are all problematlc and umlecessary packaglng and somethmg that even mdustry 
stakeholders agree needs to be phased out (4) Th1s leg1slat1on 1s lntended to hold them 
accountable and g1ve the DEP auth0r1ty to phase out other problematlc packagmg 1n the future 
Ma1ne has been a leader 1n combatmg plast1c po1lut1on We need to contlnue tlns momentum and 
exemphfy what ought to be an amb1t1ous response It 1s somethmg that my generat1on sorely 
needs 1n order to have healthy and sustalnable futures I urge you all to vote “ought to pass” on
