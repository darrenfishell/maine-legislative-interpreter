“An Act to Reduce Plastzc Packagmg Waste” 
Before the Env1romnent and Natural Resources Commlttee 
, May 15, 2023 
Good day, Senator Brenner, Representatlve Gramhch, and members of the Envlronment 
and Natural Resources Commlttee My name 1s Beth Ahearn and I am the dlrector of 
government affa1rs for Ma1ne Conservatlon Voters (MCV) MCV 1s a nonproﬁt 
organlzatron dedlcated to protectlng Ma1ne’s envlronment, democracy, and cl1mate 
future Today we are test1fy1ng 1n support of LD 1645, and commend Representatlve 
Gramllch for sponsormg 1t 
LD 1645 would phase out plast1c packag1ng by 2025 that 1s problematrc and unnecessary 
Th1s 1s not a trumped up goal, 1t 1s supported by leadlng corporatrons that make and use 
packag1ng and 1s fully achlevable It W111 boost recyclmg by remov1ng bypass and 
contam1nat1on and reduce burn1ng and landﬁlhng clrmate-damagrng plastrcs 
The approach of LD 1645 1s supported by busmesses that make and use packagrng The 
b1ll 1s modeled on an agreement by the members of the U S Plastlcs Pact -- more than 
100 buslnesses, not-for-pro ﬁt orgamzatlons, academrc and research 1nst1tut1ons, and 
government agencles known as “Actrvators ” The bus1nesses partrcrpatrng 1n thls effort -- 
1nclud1ng global food and beverage conglomerates Nestle, Coca Cola, General M1lls and 
Walmart as well as packaglng manufacturers producmg a W1de range of products from 
beverage contamers to ma1l1ng matenals --have pledged to el1m1nate from packag1ng 
eleven matenals deslgnated “problemat1c and unnecessary ” by 2025 
The phase-out goal 1s ach1evable Many of these compan1es have already taken 
srgmﬁcant steps to meet the 2025 goal, creatmg ﬁber-based bakery bag closures 1nstead 
of polystyrene, removrng non-detectable p1gments that rnterfere Wlth recyclrng 
equ1pment, and removlng chemrcals that contammate the envlronment and mlgrate mto
recycled end-products and compost Because these companres produce 37% of the p1ast1c 
packaglng 1n the U S by werght, and have a slgmﬁcant ﬁnancral and customer share of 
the global marketplace, they are Jump-startrng the changes needed to meet the 2025 goal 
Ma1ne’s recychng rate has been gomg down, not up — desp1te a plethora of pol1c1es to 
promote recychng and reuse, and warn1ngs that landﬁll space 1s scarce wrth “poss1b1e 
landﬁll closures loomlng beyond ﬁve years ” A January 2023 Department of 
Envrronmental Protectlon report found the recychng rate fell to 34 percent 1n 2020 and 
2021——down ﬁom 38 percent 1n 2018 ‘A ma] or roadblock 1s that a lot of plastrc erther 
_]L1SlL 1sn’t recyclable, or 1t rnterferes wrth the proper handlrng and recychng of the 
materrals that are recyclable Polyvmyl chlorrde (PVC) ﬁlms and bags can get tangled up 
1n resource recovery fac1l1ty sortrng machrnery and non-detectable prgments 1n plastrc 
bottles confuse opt1cal sorters and contamrnate “clean” HDPE and PET plastrcs 
PVC, PFAS and antrmony are health hazards that contamrnate any end product made 
from plast1cs contalnrng these chemrcals The result 1s erther “bypass” that ends up 1n 
landﬁlls and rncmerators, or a mrxed plastrc “recycled ” end product of poor quallty and 
l1m1ted use — reﬂected 1n a low market pnce Th1s reallty 1s borne out by Mame 
recyclers ’ experrence For example, only 2 percent of the materrals recycled by the 
Ecomarne waste-to-energy and materlal recovery fac1l1ty 1n 2022 was plastrc 
Reduc1ng problematrc plastlc packaglng has clrmate beneﬁts Plastrcs generate 
heat-trapprng gasses at every stage of therr l1fe cycle L1m1t1ng the productron of 
wasteful smgle-use plastrcs and reducrng the amount of plastlc burned 1n mcrnerators W111 
cut greenhouse gasses U S emlssrons from plastlcs 1nc1nerat1on 1n 2015 produced the 
equrvalent of 5 9 m1111on metrrc tons of carbon d1ox1de Based on p1'O_]CCt1OI'1S from the 
World Energy Councrl, 1fp1ast1cs productron and 1nc1nerat1on lncrease as expected, 
greenhouse gas emrsslons W111 mcrease to 49 m1ll1on metrrc tons by 2030 and 91 m1l11on 
metnc tons by 2050 Ma1ne’s pol1c1es alone won’t reverse th1s trend, but a srgnrﬁcant 
mcrease 1n the recychng rate by phasmg out matenals that rnterfere Wrth and degrade 
recychng would certamly cut local greenhouse gas emrssrons caused by rncrneratrng 
unrecyclable plast1c waste 
Marne 1s not actrng alone wlth LD 1645 L1ke Mame, dozens of states are phasrng out 
unrecyclable and problematrc packaglng rncludrng expanded polystyrene and slngle-use 
food contarners Calrforma and New York, hke Mame, are ‘lookmg to phase out manyof
the “unnecessary and problemat1c ” pzfckaglng materlals on the Plastlc Pact target 11st, as 
well as chem1cals of concern such as ant1mony Talwan, New Zealand, and South 
Korea have already phased out PVC 1n food packaglng, mov1ng markets and dr1v1ng 
lrmovatlon 1n the process South Korea has barmed non-detectable plast1c p1gments that 
lnterfere w1th recyclrng The European llnloh now stnctly regulates use of recycled 
plastlc 1n food contact materlal, and 1s far ahead of the U S 1n banmng much slngle-use 
plastlc packag1ng As of December 2022, Canada also bans the manufacture and rmport 
for sale of most slngle-use plastrc packagmg 
The Plast1c Pact llst of problematlc and unnecessary packaglng materlals that 1ts 
corporate “act1vat0rs ” have agreed to ellmlnate targets matenals that lnn1twhatMa1ners 
recycle Phasrng out these matenals by enactlng LD 1645 would be an lmportant step to 
boost Ma1ne’s d1m1n1sh1ng recyc11ng rate, whrle savlng 11m1ted landﬁll space for 
contam1nated b1oso11ds and truly non-recyclable trash, and cuttlng cllmate-harmlng 
greenhouse gas em1ss1ons 1n the process -
