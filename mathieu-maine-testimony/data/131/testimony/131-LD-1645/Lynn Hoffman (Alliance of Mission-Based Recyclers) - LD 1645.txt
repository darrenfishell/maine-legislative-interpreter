Re: LD 1645/ HP 1055 - An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste” 
Dear Members of the Mame State Legrslature, 
On behalf of the Alhance of M1ss1on-Based Recyclers (AMBR), we are submlttlng a letter of 
support for the Act to Reduce Plastrc Packagmg Waste @D 1645 / HP 1055), 
AMBR 1s a coahtron of the ongmal ploneers of rmsslon-drrven, communlty-based nonproﬁt 
recyclmg 1n the Umted States Together we are guldmg new recyclmg po11c1es and mfrastructure 
mvestments to reburld credible, transparent recyclmg systems As recyclmg operators, AMBR 
members collect and sort many hundreds of tons of recyclables each month As mrsslon-based 
recyclers, We are concerned about the ever-mcreasmg contammatron 1n the recyclmg stream due 
to problematlc and unnecessary plastlcs Not only does contammatlon mcrease the cost of 
recyclmg for resldents and local governments, but there 1s contmued rrsk to our workers and 
harm to publlc health and the environment when producers contmue to use harmﬁrl and 
unnecessary packagmg rather than reducmg packagmg and moving to truly reusable, recyclable, 
and compostable materlals 
For somethmg to be commonly “recyclable ” , 1t must be cfﬁclent and cost eﬁectlvc to collect and 
sort, and there needs to be stable and transparent “end-markets ” who want to buy 1t as feedstock 
for manufacturmg another product Whlle a few kmds of plastlc packagmg are good candrdates 
for recyclmg programs, most plastlcs do not meet that cr1ter1a Yet these nonrecyclable plastlcs 
are regularly placed m recyclmg bms, creatmg contammatron across the recyclmg system, 
decreaslng the quahty of sorted commodrtles bemg sold back mto the supply cham, and 
mcreasmg costs and safety nsks through the sortlng process As the‘ 
recyclmg system becomes 
more contammated, recyclers have to spend more money on staff and teclmology to effectrvely 
sort these matenals, mcreasmg the costs of recyclmg serv1ces for c1t1es and countles 
LD 1645 takes much needed steps to phase out some of these problematrc or unnecessary 
plastics 1n packagmg, mcludmg 
0 Polystyrene: From a recyclmg perspectlve, polystyrene 1s mcredlbly brrttle whrch allows 
1t to break mto t1ny smaller preces and spread wldely through our facrhty, contammatmg 
our other materlals Addltlonally, polystyrene 1s one of the most toxrc kmds of plastlc 
packagmg, and there are ready alternatlves for the single-use packagmg that polystyrene 
1s currently used for 
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): PVC 1s hlghly toxic to make, use, recycle and dlspose of 
Even when collected for “recyclmg ” , there are almost no vlable markets for the matenal
and 1t 1s 11kely to get dumped or burned creatmg 
o Toxic Additives TOXIC addltlves found m plastl 
process When matenals contammg tox1c addltlv 
evldence that toxms accumulate 
As recyclers we know there are l1m1tat1ons to what we 
plastlc packagmg Even 1f we can recycle certaln packa 
and lmportanily conslder toxlcs, envlromnental Justrce, l

c packaglng contarnmate the recyclmg

r problematlc blomass extracnon All of Whether we should These cons1derat1ons go beyond the economlc and practlcal/technologlcal,
a th1s should then be consldered m relatlon to the nnmedr 
Recyclmg can be an nnportant tool to transltlon toward
E reduce packagmg, ehmmate harmful and unnecessary p
