Testimony in Support of LD 1645: An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste Carla 
Dickstein 
Wiscasset, Maine May 15, 2023
Senator Brenner. Representative Gramlich, and members of the Joint Select 
Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, my name is Carla Dickstein and I
live in Wiscasset. I am submitting testimony today in support of LD 1645. I was a 
board member of Defend Our Health for nine years and have become increasingly 
concerned about the impact that plastics have on our health, natural environment, and 
climate change. 
This bill is important for a number of reasons. It reduces the amount of plastic 
packaging that is exposing workers, communities and consumers to toxic chemicals 
used to make plastics. Chemical companies tend to locate in communities of color 
that are subject to greater exposure to the toxic hazards of plastic chemicals, including
disease, disability and early death. 
Plastics are hard to dispose of and are increasingly littering our natural environment. 
With less demand for recycled plastics, communities have fewer disposal options and 
more of it ends up in oceans or illegally dumped. My community recycles much fewer
types of plastic than it did five years ago. 
Most importantly, plastics are made from petrochemicals. Ultimately, we need to 
reduce demand for fossil fuels, including petrochemicals that are used in plastics. 
LD 1645 is a reasonable step forward. It is a starting point in reducing the amount of 
toxic additives in plastics we produce and consume, especially when a non-plastic or 
less toxic substitute is available. The bill is not new. It is modeled after the U.S. 
Plastics Pact, a stakeholder group endorsed by 100 major consumer companies in 
January 2022. I urge you to support LD 1645. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony.
