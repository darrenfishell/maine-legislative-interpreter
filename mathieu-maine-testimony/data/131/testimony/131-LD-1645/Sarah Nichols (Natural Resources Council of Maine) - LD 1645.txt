Testimony Neither for Nor Against LD 1645, 
An Act To Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste 
Sarah NZC/’l0lS, Sustamable Mame Dzrector, May 15, 2023 
Senator Brenner, Representat1ve Graml1ch, and members of the J o1nt Stand1ng Commlttee on 
Env1romnent and Natural Resources, my name 1s Sarah N1chols, and I am the Susta1nable Mame 
D1rector for the Natural Resources Councll of Ma1ne (NRCM) I appreclate th1s opportumty to 
offer comments nelther for nor aga1nst LD 1645 
Plast1c pollut1on 1s a major threat to our natural envlronment, chmate, and publ1c 
health Plastlc waste 1s l1ttenng our waters, forests, and open spaces, chok1ng w1ldl1fe, and 
mak1ng 1ts way 1nto the food web A grow1ng body of sc1ent1ﬁc research shows that plast1c 
breaks down 1nto hard-to-detect m1crop1ast1cs, and the tox1c chem1cals used to make p1ast1c 
have harmful human health 1mpacts To make matters worse, the product1on of plast1c creates 
greenhouse gas em1ss1ons that exacerbate the cllmate cr1s1s 
Ma1ne has led the natlon 1n tacklmg plast1c pollutlon, w1th bans on slngle-use plastlc bags and 
foam food contamers, and a new law enacted 1n July 2021 that requlres b1g corporat1ons and 
manufacturers to help pay for the cost of manag1ng the1r wasteful packagmg, much of 1t plastlc 
And our work 1s not nearly done ,1 
However, NRCM 1s not convlnced that LD 1645 takes the r1ghtpol1cy approach to get us where 
we need to go regardlng responslble use of plastlcs Whlle we agree w1th the lntent of the b1ll to 
ellmlnate the use of certam types of problemat1c plast1cs that were ldentlﬁed by members of the 
US Plastlcs Pact, we have several concems about the b1ll 
F 1rst, 1t would be extremely dlfﬁcult for retallers to comply w1th th1s b111 1f 1t became law 
because they would have llttle Way of know1ng 1f an 1tem on then" shelves 1s a “proh1b1ted 
plastlc” that conta1ns non-detectable p1gments, 1s made of polyethylene terephthalate glycol, or 
was manufactured us1ng ant1mony or cobalt as a process1ng a1d or add1t1ve, among other th1ngs 
on the proh1b1ted plastlc packag1ng 11st 
Second, 1t would be very d1fﬁcu1t for the Department of Env1ronmental Protectlon (DEP) to 
enforce The DEP 1s dlrected to enforce the b111, but only when 1t “has reason to bel1eve” thata 
proh1b1ted plastlc 1s belng sold or dlstnbuted 1n the state But how would the DEP develop th1s 
“reason to bel1eve” 1nfonnat1on ‘7 Would DEP need to conduct routlne 1nspect1ons statewlde, and 
product test1ng‘7 
If such proh1b1ted plast1cs are found 1n Ma1ne stores, or beheved to be sold through on-l1ne 
reta1lers, the DEP 1s then glven a pelplexmg level of ﬂex1b1l1ty about how to enforce the ban 
LD 1645 says that the Department may d1rect the manufacturer or d1str1butor of the product to 
provlde a cert1ﬁcate to the Department regardlng the product, or 1t may not1fy the dlstnbutor to
take certam notlﬁcatlon actlons But the DEP “may” equally declde not to take these 
enforcement actlons The b1ll says that the Department “may develop rules” for the 
admmlstratlon, lmplementatlon, and enforcement of the b1ll, but that means that the Department 
1s equally free not to develop such rules Th1s vague and amblguous guldance would leave the 
DEP 1n a dlfﬁcult pos1t10n of havlng enforcement respons1b1l1t1es that 1t could pursue, or not, and 
no new resources or staff to cany 1t out — assunnng the “may” language avolds a ﬁscal note 
Add1t1onally, we are concerned that LD 1645 could lead to an 1ncrease 1n the use of compostable 
plastlc, but NRCM 1s not convmced that th1s 1s necessarlly the best alternatlve to other types of 
packaglng 1 
Our State does not currently have the mfrastructure 1n place to sustalnably manage 
compostable packagmg matenal and 1t often ends up contammatlng the recycl1ng streams Also 
compost1ng packagmg along w1th food waste may l1m1t the beneﬁts of a successful compost1ng 
operatlon 2 We bel1eve that any problematlc plastrc packaglng swaps should be w1th reusable 
packaglng or less—tox1c matenals that have a robust recycllng mfrastructure 1n place 
Fmally, we bel1eve there may be slmpler ways to ban the use of certam types of problematlc 
plast1cs used for certam ﬁmctlons, and to do so 1n a more focused and enforceable manner For 
example, the Commlttee could declde to add polystyrene foam packagmg matenals to Ma1ne’s 
ex1st1ng polystyrene foam ban for food contamers 
Thank you for your conslderatlon of our comments, and for your contlnued support of pol1c1es 
that reduce pl8.SlIlC pollutlon
