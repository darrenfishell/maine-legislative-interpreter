TESTIMONY FOR LD 1465 
Senator Brenner, Representative Gramlich, and members of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you I am Ben Lounsbury, a 
retired doctor from Auburn I am a member of a working group for the Sustainability 
Committee of the Auburn City government One of our primary duties was to work with the city 
government to try to improve recycling We did our best, but, as you may have heard, the 
Auburn City Council recently voted to do away with the recycling program The hassles of 
dealing with the cost of disposing of supposed recyclables, contaminated collections, trucking 
materials from place to place, and slowly diminishing recycling participation became too much 
for the City Council, and in a few weeks they will probably pass the final vote that will kill the 
program altogether 
If LD 1645 had been passed years ago, this might not have happened Recycling would be much 
easier with 1645 Since it IS becoming more and more obvious that the Earth might not survive 
due to many threats, including Climate Change, it is also becoming more obvious that we 
humans must learn how to manage our "stuff" LD 1645 puts into law changes and prohibitions 
that even many members of the packaging industry agree are good, and that some have started 
to do on their own It seems to me to be a ”no-brainer" to put those changes into law by 
passing LD 1645 to keep the playing field level I urge you to vote "Ought to Pass” on LD 1645 
Thank you
