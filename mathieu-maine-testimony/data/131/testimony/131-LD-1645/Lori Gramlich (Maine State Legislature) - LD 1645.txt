Testimony of Rep. Lori K Gramlich presenting 
LD 1645, An Act to Reduce Plastic Packaging Waste 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources 
Senator Brenner and honorable colleagues of the Jomt Standmg Commrttee on Envrromnent and Natural 
Resources, I am Rep Lor1 Gramhch I represent House D1stnct 113, the beautlful seaslde commumty of 
Old Orchard Beach Thank you for the opportumty to present LD 1645, An Act to Reduce Plastic 
Packaging Waste 
Plastrc use 1s a threat to our health and our envrromnent m so many ways Plast1c waste htters our 
roadways and coastlme, harrmng w1ldl1fe and breakmg down 1nto m1croscop1c pleces that are mgested 
by humans and ammals al1ke P1ast1c productlon leads to problem greenhouse gas em1ss1ons, whrch we 
know are contnbutmg to cllmate change, as does the process of dlsposmg of smgle-use plastlcs when 
they are incmerated. Plast1c productlon plants also pollute the local envrronments arotmd them, Wh1Ch 
sadly has had a drsparate rmpact on already margmahzed commumues Smgle-use plastrcs also expose 
people to harmful chemrcals that can leach 1nto our food and water The 11st goes on and on. 
For all these reasons, durmg my tune m the Legrslature, I have been proud to work on pol1c1es to try to 
encourage movmg away from smgle-use plast1cs Mame has been a leader on rssues surroundmg plastrcs 
and packagmg In 2019, we passed leg1slat1on to end the use of most plast1c bags, polystyrene foam food 
serv1ce conta1ners and p1ast1c beverage stlrrers In 2021, we moved to end the outdoor release of plast1c 
balloons, and last year, passed a b1ll requmng a m1n1mum of 25% recycled content 1n plastlc beverage 
bottles We also passed a landmark extended producer respons1b1l1ty b1ll that w1ll help push mdustry to 
l1m1t then packagmg Many of you slttmg around the horseshoe today sponsored, cosponsored or 
worked on these measures Thls commrttee has done mcredlble work to make these pol1c1es a reahty, 
and th1s b1ll 1s a cont1nuat1on of that good work 
LD 1645 W111 codrfy language from the U S Plastlcs Pact and requlre 1ndustry to keep thelr promlses of 
movmg away from mmecessary and problematlc plastrc packagmg It phases out problematrc and 
unnecessary plast1cs, 1nclud1ng polystyrene foam packmg peanuts, PVC used 1n beverage contamers and 
other apphcatrons, and other products It also authonzes the Department of Envlromnental Protect1on to
phase out other problemat1c and unnecessary plastrcs 1n packag1ng 1n the future at the1r d1scret1on, whrch 
1s nnportant as more affordable, feasrble alternatrves are becommg avarlable every year 
Over 850 corporat1ons, non-proﬁts, and local govemments agree that 1t’s t1me to move away from usmg 
plastlc packagmg that 1sn’t recyclable, compostable, or reusable They understand that there are safer 
altemanve products that have less of an envrronmental and human health lmpact 
As lawmakers, we, too, should do all we can to reduce the sources of plasttc Dozens of other states are 
phasmg out unrecyclable and problematrc packagmg, mcludmg expanded polystyrene and smgle-use 
food contamers Callforma and New York are lookmg to phase out many of the same matenals 
addressed by LD 1645 A number of countnes are also work1ng to address tlns rssue Tarwan, New 
Zealand, and South Korea have already phased out PVC m food packagmg South Korea has banned 
non-detectable plastrc plgments that mterfere w1th recyclmg The European Umon now str1ctly regulates 
use of recycled plastrc m food contact matenal, and 1s far ahead of the U S m bann1ng much smgle-use 
plastrc packagmg As of December 2022, Canada also bans the manufacture and rmport for sale of most 
slngle-use plastlc packagmg 
Unforttmately, desplte our best efforts, recyclmg alone camrot address the rssue of plastlc wasteA 
January 2023 Department of Envlromnental Protectlon reportl found the recyclmg rate fell to 34 percent 
m 2020 and 202l—dovvn ﬁ'om 38 percent m 2018 A major roadblock 1s that a lot of plastlc elther Just 
1sn’t recyclable, or 1t mterferes w1th the proper handlmg and recyclmg of the materlals that are 
recyclable PVC ﬁlms and bags can get tangled up 1n sortmg machmery, and non-detectable prgments 1n 
plastlc bottles confuse optrcal sorters and contamxnate “clean” HDPE and PET plast1cs PVC, PFAS and 
antrmony are health hazards that contamlnate any end product made from plastlcs contammg these 
chemlcals 
That leaves us w1th the unfortunate altematrves of landﬁllmg or mcmeratmg plastrc waste As members 
of the commrttee know all too well, landﬁllcapaclty 1s hrmted, and mcmeratmg plastrc waste has 1ts 
own senous umntended consequences, as I’ve mentroned 
Phaslng out problemauc plastrc matenals 1s not only perfectly feasrble but also the nght thmg to do for 
the health of Mame people, for our w1ldl1fe and for our planet Now 1s the tune to do so 
I do have a proposed amendment to share wrth the commlttee for your cons1derat1on, whtch 1s attached 
to thls testrmony The amendment exempts plastlc packagmg used for medlcal equlpment, vetermary 
equ1pment and p6Sl10lCl6S 
I ask you to please support LD 1645 and my proposed amendment Thank you for your consrderatron I 
would be glad to try to answer any questlons
