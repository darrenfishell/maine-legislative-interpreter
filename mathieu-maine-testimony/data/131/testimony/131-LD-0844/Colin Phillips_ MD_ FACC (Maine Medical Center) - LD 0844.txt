As a practicing interventional cardiologist in Maine, I am interested in providing the 
best care for patients.  This bill allows our excellent team members assist in 
procedures under my direction using skills that they have been trained on.  It will help
procedures move more efficiently and safely.  As the governor of the Maine Chapter 
of the American College of Cardiology, I have reviewed this bill with other 
cardiologists in the state who are also in agreement with its merits.  Thank you for 
your consideration.
