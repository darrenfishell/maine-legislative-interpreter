David  Burkey, MD
Cape Elizabeth, Maine
LD 844
My name is David Burkey, MD.  Until my retirement on March 3rd of this month I 
was an Interventional and Structural Cardiologist working for MaineHealth.  My role 
as the Medical Director of the SMMC CVT program is being transitioned to a 
working Interventionalist.
My exposure to work in the cath lab in Maine is extensive.  I started training in the 
Cath lab at Maine Medical Center in 1990 and have worked in cath labs in the State of
Maine for  all but 2 of those years.  I have performed well over 20,000 procedures and
have worked with 100's of CVT trained professionals  including those in training at 
SMMC.
I am very much in favor of LD 844.  It is in everyone's best interest in the room 
performing a catheterization  procedure to complete them in the safest and most 
efficient means possible.  CVT's have the training and experience to help manage 
radiation exposure.  Ultimately the Physician performing the procedure is responsible 
for the radiation dose used.  However, minimizing the radiation dose to the patient 
and to everyone in the cath lab is best done  by empowering those providers in the 
room with appropriate training to take responsibility for radiation exposure and dose.  
CVT's, in my experience,  are more than capable in this regard.  They are often 
scrubbed and standing next to the Physician during procedures and are in the best 
position to assist in minimizing the radiation dose.  I have over 30 years of cath lab 
experience and have no reservations about the proposals made in LD 844.  These 
changes are well within the professional capabilities of CVT's as they are trained and 
certified in the State of Maine.
