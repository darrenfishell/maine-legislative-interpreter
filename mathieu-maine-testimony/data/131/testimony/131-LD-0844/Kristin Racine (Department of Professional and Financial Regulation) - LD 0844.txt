NEITHER FOR NOR AGAINST L.D. 844 
“An Act to Protect the Practice of Certain Cardiovascular Professionals ” 
Sponsored by Rebecca J. Millett 
BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services 
Public Hearing: March 16, 2023, 1:00 PM 
Senator Bailey, Representative Perry, and honorable members of the Health Coverage, Insurance 
and Financial Services Committee, my name is Kristin Racine, and l am the attorney for the Ofﬁce 
of Professional and Occupational Regulation (OPOR). l am here to speak neither for nor against 
LD 844 on behalf of OPOR. 
This bill proposes to add a chapter to Title 32 to exempt cardiovascular professionals who have 
been formally trained and issued credentials by a nationally recognized association from the 
requirements of licensure for any of the professions listed in Title 32, so long as their actions are 
dictated by and performed in the presence of a physician. We oppose the bill as drafted because the 
language is ambiguous and would be difﬁcult to enforce. 
We understand that while Maine law permits physicians to delegate certain activities, no activity 
may be delegated that otherwise would require a state license. We further understand that some 
of the activities cardiovascular professionals would like to perform under physician delegation 
currently require one or more state licenses. The intent of the bill would be more properly 
accomplished through speciﬁc exemptions to licensure provided in the respective enabling 
statutes for each board/program affected. This would involve a speciﬁc exemption toa 
particular professional license, by explicitly stating what activities are exempted and under what 
circumstances. For example, the governing law of the Radiologic Technology Board of 
Examiners already exempts the requirement of a license for certain persons, and an additional 
exemption could be added to 32 M.R.S. § 9854(3) to the extent the committee thought it was safe 
and appropriate to do so. 
At this point, we are not able to Weigh in on the appropriateness of any exemption or on the 
OFFTCESI GARDTNER ANNEX, ?(> NORTHliRN AVENUE. (.iARl)lNl§R, MAINE

extent of the exempted activities that should be permitted without compromising the public’s 
health and welfare. Rather, we note that if such a decision is made to legislatively create 
exemptions to licensure, then a speciﬁc statutory exemption would be a more appropriate vehicle 
to do so for the sake of clarity and enforcement. 
I am happy to answer any questions now or at the work session.
