RE: Testimony in Opposition to L.D. 1746, An Act to Require Responsible Contracting 
Practices for Public Construction Projects.  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Labor and Housing,  MCCS appreciates the interests and concerns underlying the 
intention of this bill.   As a leader of workforce development thro ughout the state, we understand 
the importance of economic development and the benefits of a well -trained workforce.   Indeed, 
our long -term goal at MCCS is to use educational opportunities  to steadily and continually 
provide more Maine residents with highe r-skilled and therefore higher -paying jobs throughout 
our state.    
We share the concerns on this bill as expressed by the administration. Despite good intentions, 
requirements such as those in this bill rarely fit the realities of the marketplace.  
It is well studied and understood that smaller markets create higher prices, and right now MCCS 
cannot afford potential cost increases.   We are very concerned about the impact of this bill on our 
budget.   We already face  delays in our campus renovation and  improvement  projects and further 
contracting requirements would not only slow our process but may dissuade bids at all.  
Our resources are focused on addressing the skills gap that has become more profound as we 
enter the post -pandemic era.  Any legislatio n that causes a structural increase in costs  comes at 
the expense of developing the workforce Maine needs to succeed in the post -pandemic economy.  
For the reasons set forth above, MCCS respectfully requests that this Committee report this bill 
Ought Not to  Pass.  
 
Thank you for the courtesy of your consideration.
