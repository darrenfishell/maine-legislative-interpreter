  Michael Buescher , Esq., Chair  
 TESTIMONY NEITHER FO R NOR AGAINST  
 
L.D. 1746  
 
AN ACT TO REQUIRE RE SPONSIBLE CONTRACTING PRACTICES  
FOR PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS  
 
Senator Tipping, Representative Roeder, and members of the Committee on Labor 
and Housing. I am Steven Bailey, executive director of the Maine School Boards 
Association, testifying on behalf of the legislative committee of the Maine School 
Boards Association, neither for nor against L.D. 1746.  
 
We certainly support the stipulation that a contractor working on a public con-
struction project that receives state funding, which includes schools, be qualified. 
Our districts not only consider the cost of project bids, but also the qualifications 
and track record of the companies bidding on the work.  
 
Our concern with the bill is the section that requires the state to use Project Labor 
Agreements, which is defined as a pre -hire collective bargaining agreement with 
one or more labor unions.  
 
This stipulation limits our ability to hire the best qualified workers, including some 
local contractors who do not belong to a union, but live in the community. It is 
those local taxpayers who pay the local share of school projects.  
 
We support both union and non -union workers and want to retain the ability to 
hire quality workers and also support our local economy when possible.
