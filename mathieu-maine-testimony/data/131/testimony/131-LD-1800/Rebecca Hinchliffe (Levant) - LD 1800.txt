LD 1800
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee, my name is Rebecca Hinchliffe. I am writing in support 
of LD1129, LD1196, LD1199, LD1518, LD1589, LD1643, and LD1800.
I am a parent of six children. When our four older kids transferred in high school from
homeschooling to public school, maintaining involvement in their education was 
crucial. Knowing what they were learning, reading, and being taught has given us 
opportunities to help them navigate the many decisions they have made. It also 
fostered wonderful working relationships along the way with all parties involved. 
These bills today are key to the success of students as well as teachers. They will 
preserve and protect the rights of parents to oversee the education of their children for
generations to come. In light of the recent situations that have violated these rights, 
bills like these are necessary. Any initiative that encourages, promotes, and protects 
parental involvement is good for Maine students, Maine schools, and Maine families.
Please vote ought to pass for all of these bills. Thank you so much for your time and 
service. 
Sincerely,
Rebecca Hinchliffe
