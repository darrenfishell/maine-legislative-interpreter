LD 1800
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of LD 1800.
I am a lifelong Maine resident with three children in the public school system. I have 
found my own public school education (in the early ‘90’s) to serve me well. I believe 
that public school can provide a solid foundation of early learning to help all Maine 
students prepare for the challenges of Higher Learning and/or adulthood in general.
Parents Have a unique duty and responsibility for the well-being of our children. If 
there are serious issues that children are facing at school and school faculty members 
are aware and purposely not informing parents, that is wrong. That is an abuse of the 
trust that parents place in our schools. We should not accept that there are just some 
secrets that teachers and the school system should keep from parents.
Please deem LD 1800 “Ought To Pass”.
