LD 1800
I am writing in opposition to LD 1800, “An Act Regarding Parental Rights in 
Education.”  This bill essentially removes schools—and the teachers and 
administrators who work in them—from making decisions about education.  How is a
teacher supposed to organize a class for twenty or thirty students if they are waiting 
on approval from various parents about various curricula?  How is a principal 
supposed to set class schedules if they don’t know what the content will be?  The 
central problem with the bill is that it takes authority away from schools, but not 
responsibility: students will still be in class on a daily basis throughout the academic 
year, and teachers and administrators will still have to help them learn as they work 
through the day and the year.  This bill does nothing but make the work of teaching 
even more difficult than it already is, and ought not to pass.
