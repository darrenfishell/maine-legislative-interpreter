It was the most embarrassing how they treat Deaf person in the lobby (public) to use 
VRI which it was not very private. I asked them to move VRI to the appropriate 
location while people were standing behind me. Struggled! Then moved me to 
another space which it was worse due to the hallway. I explained that VRI should be 
confidential in the exam room. The interpreter (VRI) doesn’t understand my point. 
Best to have live in person on site(s) and many reasons such as movement’s and too 
messy in some interactions while exam room. Really, several experiences with VRI in
Physical Therapy, others! I never like VRI in any hospitals or doctors offices. We 
need live interpreter in person. Please respect Deaf people needs. My experience with 
Physical Therapy and how can I watch in a small device for a long period. It hurts my 
neck/back. Dr has to move the device a few times (very uncomfortable) and all of my 
doctors doesn’t please with that.
