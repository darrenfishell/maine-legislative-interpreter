Re:  LD 976 Resolve, to Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to Appropriate Communication Methods for Deaf 
and Hard -of-hearing Patients  
 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and esteemed Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Health and Human Services:  
 
This letter provides information regarding LD 976 Resolve, to Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to 
Appropriate Communication Methods for Deaf and Hard -of-hearing Patients .  The Department of Labor  is neither 
for nor against this bill.  This resolve establishes a Task Force to study accessibility to appropriate communication 
methods for deaf and hard -of-hearing patients in healthcare settings and make recommendations on how that 
accessibility may be i mproved.   The Task Force is required to submit a report and suggested legislation by 
December 6, 2023, to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, which is authorized to report 
out legislation based on the report to the Second Regular Se ssion of the 131st Legislature.  The Task Force is to be 
staffed by the Legislative Council.  
 
As part of the Bureau of Rehabilitation Service s at the Maine Department of Labor, the Division for the Deaf, Hard 
of Hearing, and Late Deafened (DHHLD) provides vocational rehabilitation services, as well as information, 
referrals, and advocacy on behalf of Mainers who are Deaf, hard of hearing and late deafened. Each year we assist 
over a thousand individuals with employment  and respond to approximately three hun dred request s for information 
and referrals.  We also contract with Disability Rights Maine  to provide a Telecommunications Equipment Program  
and Civil Rights Advocacy t hat reach thousands of Deaf, hard of hearing and late deafen ed residents across the 
state.  
 
All Maine citizens have a right to be able to fully understand information about their health  and wellbeing .  
Anecdotally , we are aware that communication access to that for those who are Deaf and hard of hearing is not 
consistently available in th e manner appropriate to the person and situation across the state , particularly in more 
rural areas .  One example is a situation where a Deaf per son was in a mental health crisis ; another was when the 
person was giving birth.  Video Remote Interpreting was not able to meet the individualâ€™s need s and an in-person  
interpreter was not provided , exacerbating  already extremely stressful situations.   Another big frustration that we 
hear about is when healthcare providers wear masks that are not clear and continue to talk with their mouth covered, 
impeding effective communication with the Deaf and hard of hearing  patient.  
 
We do note that as the Resolve is written, it is unclear who would be respon sible and what resources would be made 
available but f urther study that results in better data about these unmet needs would be informative.  Resources 
could then be better develop ed and target ed to where they are needed to reduce misunderstandings of diag nosis and 
 
 treatment of health conditions for individuals who are Deaf and hard of hearing.  We would be happy to participate 
in such an effort although  the degree of involvement would be limited with our existing capacity.  
 
Thank you for the consideration of this information.  Please feel free to contact Terry Morrell, who is the director 
of our Division for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Late Deafened , if we can be of further assistance as you consider 
this very important healthcare issue .
