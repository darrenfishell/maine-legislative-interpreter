To Honorable Members of the Committee,
My name is Deborah S. Myers. My lifelong career has been involved in serving 
individuals who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing, both as a certified interpreter and as a 
teacher of the deaf. Over the years I have seen many positive changes and movement 
in the area of repairing the disparities for these individuals in medical settings. 
However, in recent years, there has been a regression in the provision and quality of 
interpreting services, and choice around the best match for each situation. Some 
examples that come to mind are: requiring VRI services for people who have low 
vision or are Deafblind(and cannot access the interpreter by vision only), lack of 
provision of interpreters for  planning meetings with nursing home patients, refusal to 
wear a clear mask or remove mask, and refusal to provide interpreters (both in-person 
and VRI) in the emergency room.
Choice and preferences according to a person's individual communication mode(s) 
must be considered in order to provide equitable medical services. 
Please feel free to contact me and thank you very much for your consideration and 
work on this crucial topic,
Sincerely,
Deborah Myers
