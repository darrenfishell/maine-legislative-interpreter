My name is Theresa.  I would like to share my experience regarding VRI and iPad 
issues.  For instance, couple years ago, I went to SVH in Pittsfield for nutrition 
appointment.  They had iPad tablet and VRI.  When I arrived there, I had to wait for 
little longer and then was told that I needed to reschedule my appointment.   I think 
this happened twice for the same appointment.  The staff there told me that there was 
technical problem with tablet or VRI.  I experienced with VRI freeze at my 
appointments in various medical facilities.  At my doctor office, I told medical 
assistant to use this specific room that will work fine with VRI.   However, technical 
problems popped up occasionally.  The staff had to fix the problem with file doctor 
and I waited.  EMMC refused to provide live interpreters.  At Joseph Hospital is great
with respecting Deaf and Hard of Hearing clients wishes on what they need like live 
interpreters.  When I had outpatient appointment at St Joseph, I requested live 
interpreter.  No issue.  I no longer go to EMMC.  Thank you for your time to read my 
testimony.
