Sen. Joseph Baldacci, Rep. Michele Myer, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and
Human Services,
I am a Family Nurse Practitioner with 25 years of practice, and have been a nurse for 
over 40 years. I
have encountered firsthand the frustration and misunderstandings that can occur for 
both the Deaf and
Hard of Hearing patient, and the provider. Working with a patient toward their health,
necessitates
both trust and good communications. It is very difficult for a provider to be given the 
kind of time it can
take, to care for a Deaf or HOH individual in a holistic way. So much of our 
healthcare is based on
prevention, and working out mutual goals between provider and patient is central to 
our relationship
with patients. And that relationship is central to health.
Deaf and HOH individuals, just like the rest of the patient population, have many 
different levels of
communication needs and skills. The benefit of having an ASL interpreter cannot be 
overstated. They
help me, as a provider , know that my explanations and care plan is being understood;
for the patient, it
also means that her/his provider is truly understanding what the health issue is that 
they are presenting
with. None of this can happen quickly, yet our current medical system often demands 
this must be
accomplished in less than 15 min slots. For the hearing person it is a challenge; for the
Deaf or HOH
patient, often impossible.
That is why I fully support LD 976, which is simply a first step in examining the 
issues, and hopefully a
first step in providing the solutions. This is a critical need for Deaf and HOH patients,
and also for their
providers. Thank you for your attention. Please recognize the importance of LD 976, 
and vote &quot; Ought to
Pass&quot;.
