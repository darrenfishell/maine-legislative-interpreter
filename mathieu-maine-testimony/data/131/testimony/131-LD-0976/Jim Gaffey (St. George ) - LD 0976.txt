RE: Testimony in favor of LD #976  
Dear Member of the Committee Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, 
I am Jim Gaffey  a resident of Saint Gorge,  and I am writing to express my strong support for LR # 976 
to Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to Appropriate Communication Methods for Deaf and Hard-
of-hearing Patients. 
In 2015, I had a stroke. I was taken to Pen Bay and there was no interpreter. During my stay, my access to 
communication was my sister interpreting on my phone via facetime.  
I encourage you to support LD #976.  
Thank you,  
Jim Gaffey
