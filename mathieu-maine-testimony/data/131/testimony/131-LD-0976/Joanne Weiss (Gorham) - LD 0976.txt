Good day, 
I am a nationally certified sign language interpreter. I have been interpreting since 
1991, with the majority of my work in healthcare settings.
I am in support of LD 976. 
Accessibility to Appropriate Communication Methods is critical for the safety and 
wellbeing of our Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Be well ~~
Joanne Weiss, CI/CT
