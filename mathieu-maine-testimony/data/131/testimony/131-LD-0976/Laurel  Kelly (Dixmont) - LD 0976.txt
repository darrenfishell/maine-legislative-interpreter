RE: Testimony in favor of LD #976  
Dear Member of the Committee Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, 
I am Laurel Kelly a resident of Dixmont, and I am writing to express my strong support for LR # 976 to 
Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to Appropriate Communication Methods for Deaf and Hard-of-
hearing Patients. 
I receive healthcare services in the Bangor area. In the past, while receiving services from Northern Light, 
I requested a live interpreter for a shoulder appointment. When I arrived, I was giving Video Remote 
Interpreting (VRI). I was uncomfortable, left and had to reschedule the appointment a month later and a 
live interpreter was given to me. This was much more efficient.  
 It is difficult to use VRI during x-rays and while receiving shots. The VRI  
It has been clear, and others have noted, that I am much healthier, and make healthier choices for myself, 
am better at managing pain, when I have a live interpreter.  I urge you to support LD#976. 
Sincerely,  
 
Laurel Kelly
