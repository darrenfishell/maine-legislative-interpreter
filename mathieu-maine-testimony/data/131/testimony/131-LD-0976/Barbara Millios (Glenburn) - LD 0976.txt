Greetings Legislators,
I am writing to address the need for improvement in the delivery of healthcare 
services to Deaf community members, especially those whose language is American 
Sign Language (ASL). 
I have been a professional interpreter, certified in 1993 by the Registry of Interpreters 
for the Deaf, for 30 years. In that time, I have interpreted in a myriad of healthcare 
settings: primary care and specialty care physicians, including eye doctors, dentists, 
podiatrists et al. I have been the interpreter on site when babies have been born and 
when a Deaf patient is in the last stages of life. 
I have also witnessed many situations where interpreting services were requested in 
these same settings but all too often denied. I have personal knowledge of many Deaf 
people who have struggled to get healthcare at all because their right to an interpreter 
is denied. Or, perhaps other means, such as a computer interface of some kind is 
offered. If it is an English based communication mode, a Deaf client all too often does
not have the English skills to adequately communicate in that mode. Or, if it is a 
remote interpreter, the quality of technology â€“ internet speed or monitor resolution are
well below a level that can accommodate true communication in ASL. 
Thirty years may have a certain familiarity to you. It is also the number of years since 
the Americans with Disabilities Act was first put into law. It states that Deaf 
consumers have certain very clear rights to expect communication that fits their needs
in most settings, and in particular in the healthcare setting. It is high time doctors, 
dentists, hospitals, walk-in care facilities, all service providers in healthcare heed the 
law, the very rights of the Deaf, ASL using patient population of Maine.
