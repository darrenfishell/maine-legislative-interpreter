RE: Testimony in favor of LD# 976
Dear Member of the Committee Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human 
Services,
I am Melinda Stamp, a resident of Portland, and I am writing to express my strong 
support for LD #976, to Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to Appropriate 
Communication Methods for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Patients.
As a member of the deaf community, I have personally experienced numerous 
barriers when trying to access healthcare services. One of the biggest challenges I 
have encountered is the limited access to qualified American Sign Language (ASL) 
interpreters in healthcare settings. This has made it difficult to communicate 
effectively with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and 
misdiagnosis, and even inappropriate treatments.
I believe that the Task Force on Accessibility to Appropriate Communication 
Methods for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Patients can make a significant difference in 
addressing these barriers. I am pleased to see that the task force will study 
accessibility to appropriate communication methods for deaf and hard-of-hearing 
patients in healthcare settings, including the availability of ASL interpreters and other 
communication technologies that can help to bridge the gap between healthcare 
providers and patients.
I urge you to support this important legislation and take action to ensure that all 
patients, including those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, have equal access to 
healthcare services. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Melinda Stamp
