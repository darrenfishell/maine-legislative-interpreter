Re: LD 976, Resolve, to Establish the Task Force on Accessibility to 
Appropriate Communication Methods for Deaf and Hard-of-hearing 
Patients 
Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health & Human Services: 
My name is Thomas Minch, and I am an Advocate at Disability Rights Maine 
(DRM). DRM is Maine's federally funded Protection and Advocacy agency. Our 
mission is to advance justice and equality by enforcing rights and expanding 
opportunities for people with disabilities in M_aine. 
DRM's Deaf Services division was formed in 2015, when the programs and staff of 
the former Maine Center on Deafness (MCD)' joined the agency. This addition 
carried forward a 30-year legacy of history, knowledge, and advocacy for people 
who are Deaf, Hard of Hearing, Late-Deafened, or Deaf-Blind in the State of 
Maine. 
I am here because DRM sees a tremendous need for improved access to effective 
communication in health care settings for Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and other 
individuals with disabilities. Our agency is frequently contacted by Deaf and Hard 
of Hearing patients who experience challenges across health settings and 
throughout the health care experience. From difficulty scheduling services and

interacting with office staff, to communication problems during exams, 
procedures and routine care. 
Although existing civil rights laws require health care providers to provide equal 
access and effective communication for people with disabilities, DRM is aware 
that this requirement is not always met. We see requests for accommodations 
that are ignored and unaddressed. We see individuals who do not receive 
interpreting services or communication aids that they need to discuss health 
concerns, or to understand follow up instructions. And, we see insufficient 
policies, planning, and training to prevent these problems. 
The calls that we receive are not isolated incidents. DRM recently partnered with 
JSl Research & Training Institute to conduct a mixed-methods research project to 
identify and quantify the barriers that Mainers with disabilities face when 
attempting to access health care services. The project collected information 
directly from individuals through surveys and focus groups. Over 600 Mainers 
completed the survey and over 80 participated in the focus groups. The results 
found that communication problems in health care were a common and major 
barrier, particularly for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals. The full project 
report will be released this Spring. 
These results are consistent with other studies finding that Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing patients and their families face many challenges to receiving 
communication accommodations in health care settings?2 
The consequences are serious. Medical situations are stressful, and often high 
stakes. When communication is compromised, patients may not disclose 
important details, understand a diagnosis, or comprehend their treatment 
options or plan of care. ineffective communication can lead to poor health 
outcomes, longer hospital stays, and unnecessary health care spending? ’ Over 
time, systemic communication barriers translate into health disparities. For

example, Deaf or hard of hearing adults are three times more likely to report fair 
or poor health as compared to the general population. “ 
However, these realities can be changed. There are a number of communication 
accommodation options widely available. Good access to care is possible, not only 
for Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals, but also for individuals with other 
disabilities impacting communication. But, individual complaints cannot be relied 
on as the only method of change. 
System-wide efforts must be explored and supported for all individuals to have 
equal access to communication in healthcare, and to eliminate health care 
disparities for people with disabilities. 
Thank you for your time. 
Sincerely,
