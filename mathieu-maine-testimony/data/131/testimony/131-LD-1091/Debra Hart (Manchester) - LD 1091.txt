Representative Meyer
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee
My name is Debra Hart, and I am a resident of Manchester, Maine.  I am speaking to you 
today on behalf of my client, the Maine Campground Owners Association (MECOA) in full 
support of LD 1091, Resolve, Directing the Department of Health & Human Services to 
Review its  ‘Rules Regarding Campgrounds in Order to Ensure Campground Health and 
Safety.  
MECOA represents over 180 of Maine’s licensed campgrounds and state parks.  They 
Association is located in Auburn, Maine and provide members with marketing, advocacy 
and educational tools for their members.  MECOA works with their members on a number 
of best practices and participate fully with the Maine Tourism Alliance to ensure that out 
in-state and out-of-state guests have a safe and positive experience when camping in 
Maine.
We believe the last time the rules were reviewed was around 2005, and times and many 
things have obviously changed since then.  MECOA is committed to best practices and 
would greatly appreciate a seat at the table as the Department looks at ways to improve 
anything to do with camping safety.  MECOA feels the department would benefit greatly by 
having their professional expertise at the table.
Please let us know how we can help, and again, how MECOA might participate in this 
important endeavor.
