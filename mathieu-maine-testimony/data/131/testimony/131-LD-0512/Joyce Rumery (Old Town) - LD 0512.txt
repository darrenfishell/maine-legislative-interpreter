LD 512 - An Act to Promote Student Enrollment and Degree Completion in the 
University of Maine System by Providing Tuition Waivers to Eligible Students
I am writing in support of LD 512 - An Act to Promote Student Enrollment and 
Degree Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing Tuition Waivers 
to Eligible Students.  
This bill will help Maine students who were faced with challenges to their education 
by the pandemic.   The tuition waivers for enrolled or returning students will provide 
assistance for Maine students to attend the University of Maine System, similar to 
those students benefiting from free community college.
Education is important to the success of the individual and this bill will provide 
another pathway to that success.
