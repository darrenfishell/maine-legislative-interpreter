Dear Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
My name is Laura Mitchell and I am a resident of Orono, ME, a University of Maine 
undergraduate and graduate degree alumni. I spent part of my childhood growing up 
in Orono and had family that worked for the University of Maine.
I am writing in support of LD512, An Act to Promote Student Enrollment and Degree
Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing Tuition Waivers to 
Eligible Students.
Attending university was a challenge when I graduated high school because it 
required taking out loans, and these limited my options in terms of what jobs I could 
take afterward as I had loan payments. My BS was a critical stepping stone for future 
success. Today, I worry that attending University has just gotten so much farther out 
of reach financially for today's youth and Maine desperately needs this young, 
educated workforce to maintain our economy.
In most of Maine, the only age group of our population that is growing is  65+. As they retire, 
we need a highly educated workforce to replace them. Attending university is a critical step in 
building that pipeline of workers.
With Community Colleges continuing to provide tuition waivers, the market of youth that are 
seeking a university education should be provided that same benefit when eligible based on 
LD512.
As an Orono resident, I also see the outsized impact the University of Maine has on a 
huge surrounding area's economy, culture, and workforce. We need to support our 
public universities as they are not only vital lifelines for our workforce, but vital 
lifeblood to the communities they are in.
Investing in education is an investment in our future, particularly when we are 
investing in our own Maine youth.
Please support LD512.
Thank you.
