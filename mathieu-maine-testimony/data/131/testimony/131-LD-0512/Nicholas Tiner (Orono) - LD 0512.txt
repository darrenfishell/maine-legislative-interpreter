LD 512
My name is Nicholas Tiner, I am a senior at UMaine studying Civil Engineering and I
strongly support LD 512. I feel very fortunate to attend my home state's university. 
Not only have I received a good education, but my time at UMaine has deepened my 
ties to Maine culturally. This has made the option to stay in Maine after graduation 
much more appealing to me. I believe one of the greatest things the legislature could 
do is give more Maine students that same opportunity. 
Unfortunately, tuition costs at UMaine can be prohibitively expensive to many 
in-state students. Several close friends of mine from high school were simply unable 
to afford to go to UMaine despite wanting to continue their education there. At least 
two of my friends ended up pursuing out-of-state options because of this. 
The current resources to assist prospective students financially are insufficient and 
with enrollment trending downward, action needs to be taken. This is why I firmly 
believe LD 512 is what we as students, and as Mainers, need to make UMaine the 
best university it can be. LD 512 will make education for Maine students more 
accessible and provide a much-needed shot in the arm for a campus that has never 
fully bounced back from the pandemic. 
Thank you all for your time, it is sincerely appreciated. I hope you will support LD 512 to help 
Maine's students and by extension: Maine's future.
