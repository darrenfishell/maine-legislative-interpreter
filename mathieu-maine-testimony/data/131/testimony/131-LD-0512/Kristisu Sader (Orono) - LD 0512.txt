LD 512
Think of the resources lost to families over the pandemic period. Think of the loss to 
vulnerable young people over this period.  This period of stagnation may have dashed 
many young peoples dreams for  their futures. I support LD 512 to provide 50% 
waiver on tuition for eligible students.
