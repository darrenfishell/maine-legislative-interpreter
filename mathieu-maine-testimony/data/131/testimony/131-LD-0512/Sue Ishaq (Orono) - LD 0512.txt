As a faculty member at the University of Maine, I have spoken with many students 
who were disrupted by the pandemic for several years, and who are having trouble 
affording a college education because of that disruption. Many of our students are 
facing a higher cost of living, a higher cost of education, and are providing more 
support for  their families back home. Many students are working one or more jobs to 
afford their education, and a lack of funding support is one of the reasons students 
have to leave school. By providing financial support to Maine students, we ensure that
they have access to a high quality education at our excellent community colleges here 
in Maine, and that they can afford to pursue careers which in turn benefit the Maine 
community.
