“Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and other members of the Education and 
Cultural Affairs Committee,
My name is Melinda Butler,  my pronouns are she, hers.  and I am an assistant 
professor in Literacy Education at the University of Southern Maine  and I am here to 
testify in support of LD 512, An Act to Promote Student Enrollment and Degree 
Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing Tuition Waivers to 
Eligible Students.
The Free Community College program is an excellent program and provides such a 
service to Maine families. However, as a result of this program and other factors, the 
University of Maine system has seen undergraduate student enrollment declines in 
recent years. Providing tuition waivers for eligible students to promote student 
enrollment in the University of Maine system makes sense;  some of Maine students’ 
career goals can be better achieved in a four-year college setting.
