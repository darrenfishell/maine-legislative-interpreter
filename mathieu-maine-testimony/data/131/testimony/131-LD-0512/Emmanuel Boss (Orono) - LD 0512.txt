LD 512
Dear legislators,
The University of Maine has suffered decreasing enrollment due to both COVID as well as the
free tuition afforded to in-state students going to community college. As a result of this as well
as increasing costs while tuition has not increased, the university has found itself in a 
significant deficit. This deficit is now being covered by, among other approaches, encouraging
many senior faculty to retire by providing them retirement incentive. This action resulted in 
departments becoming significantly short staffed and with the danger of a decrease in the 
quality of the education provided to UMaine's students.
I strongly support LD 512 as it will assist UMaine in increasing enrollment which, I 
hope, will assist in hiring of qualified teaching staff. The state of Maine needs a 
vibrant university system to support its education as well as research needs.
I also feel there is room for cost savings at the UM System. The total number of 
university students in ME is about 23,000, equivalent to a mid-size college in many 
other states (that are run by one president and one administration). Yet, in ME, we 
have much duplication of positions between many small campuses + a whole 
administration around the chancellor. One wonders at the costs saving that could be 
had if all were run as a single campus or, as was done in Connecticut I believe, if the 
main campus in Orono being one university (as a research intensive university it has 
special needs) and all the other campuses being run as a system with one president 
and provost.
Respectfully yours, Emmanuel Boss, Orono, Maine
