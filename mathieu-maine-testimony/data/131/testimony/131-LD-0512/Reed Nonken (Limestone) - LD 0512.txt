I believe the promotion of student enrollment and completion at the Community 
College system has been a tremendous opportunity for the community colleges and 
the students attending those institutions. However, I also believe that has created an 
adverse situation at Maine's universities by directly decreasing enrollment and 
limiting student's options. I believe it is critically important for the sustainability of 
Maine's universities, but also for students preferring to enroll in universities rather 
than community colleges - that we extend this benefit to both educational systems. 
The current incentives negatively impact universities and students preferring the 
university experience, and this bill would balance that inequity and provide additional
opportunities for students. Thank you.
