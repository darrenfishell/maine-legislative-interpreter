To Members of the Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs,
I am writing in support of LD 512, which will provide tuition waivers to eligible students at the 
University of Maine. This bill would provide needed assistance to University of Maine students 
who, just like their peers in the community college system, face financial difficulties after the 
COVID pandemic.
I am currently an adjunct professor at the University of Maine-Orono, and previously completed 
my doctorate degree at the same institution. Through the nearly ten years I have been affiliated 
with the University, I have supported students who not only take on full course loads but also 
work full time because of economic need. These students have only faced increasing financial 
pressure over the last few years. I see this in all my classes and hear it from my students.
UMaine students are an essential part of the Orono community; they are also an essential part of 
the future of the state of Maine. The state legislature should enact LD512 to continue to support 
higher education in Maine.
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely,
Emma Schroeder, PhD
