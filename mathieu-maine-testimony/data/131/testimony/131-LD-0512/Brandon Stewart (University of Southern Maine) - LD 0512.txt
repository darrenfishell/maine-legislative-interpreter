LD 512
I am here to testify that higher education has become impossible for a large 
percentage of the population of Maine.  By most research accounts, 80% of the 
increased costs in higher education has occured because America has stopped 
providing funding through state finances and federal finances.  That is to say, college 
is 80% more expensive today than it was 25 years ago because we, America, have 
stopped supporting and have instead put that burden on young Americans in the guise 
of student loans. These student loans are crippling.  People complain about their 
student loans from 25 years ago, but they were 80% less than what our young 
Americans suffer through today.  They are pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, 
but they are 80% heavier because of the debt that we, the older generation have put 
upon them. Please do something about this inequality and support LD 512.
