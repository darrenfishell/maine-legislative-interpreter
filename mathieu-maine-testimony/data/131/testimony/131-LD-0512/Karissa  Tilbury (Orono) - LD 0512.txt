I would like to highlight programs similar to LD 512 tha t were implemented in Wisconsin and recently 
expanded to support low -income students at tendance at the University of Wisconsin Madison. In 2018, 
the state legislature instituted Bucky’s Tuition Promise  for all Wiscon sin households wi th an adjusted 
gross income of $65,000 or less. Under this program, inc oming freshmen received 8 consecutive 
semesters of free tuition and segregated fees and transfer students received 2 years. This program  was 
wildly successful an d the impact on the lives of ~ 3,500 Wisconsin students. Student highlights can be 
found here.   Recently, the Wisconsin State legislature expanded the program to create Bucky ’s Pell 
Pathway program .  This program is for Pell Grant eligible Wisconsin residents and provides not only 
support via grants, sc holarships, and work -study for i ncoming and transfer students but also provides 
opportunity for tailored advising and additional opportunities to seek out the full college experience 
including industrial CO -OP experiences and study abroad for holistic educational experiences.  
Maine criti cally nee ds programs that are long -term. LD 512 is a short -term solution that is only beneficial 
to students graduating high school during a short  window . Furthermore, we can do better and be sure 
that we offer all eligible Maine students the critical mentoring support as they pursue their college 
degrees. Minimizing the financial burden is helpful, but it is only a small fraction of the entire holistic , 
college experience. I am already part of a NSF funded S -STEM project here at UMaine  (Building B ridges 
to Engineering Students (BBEST),  that will provide the nurturing environment to support the 
professional training and development of the next generation of engineers .  I look forward to seeing the 
impact o f programming targeting affordab ility of higher education for Mainers and its economic 
benefits.
