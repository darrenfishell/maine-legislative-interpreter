LD 512
I write in support of LD 512. Community Colleges in Maine and across the country were 
suffering from enrollment losses and the Governor and Legislature stepped up to help the 
Community College System enrollment with free tuition for their students. While this effort 
was and is noble, it has had a negative impact on the enrollment at the State’s four-year 
public institutions. The University of Maine System cannot absorb the financial shock of losing
so many students coming out of Maine’s high schools. LD 512 would help to address this 
issue as well as continue the good work begun with the Community College system of making
higher education attainable for more Maine students. The University of Southern Maine, and 
its sibling universities, educate many first-generation students and students who come to the 
University of Maine System at great sacrifice. Textbooks, transportation, food can seem like 
luxuries to many of our students, who struggle daily to get by. Making education available to 
as many Maine students as possible would be a great legacy and would help immensely with 
the daunting structural and demographic challenges facing the University of Maine System.
