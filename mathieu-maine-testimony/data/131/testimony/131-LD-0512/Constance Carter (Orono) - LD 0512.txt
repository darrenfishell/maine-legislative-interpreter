I would like to offer my support for this legislation.  As we all know, the past three years have 
presented innumerable challenges to students.  Those who are wanting to pursue higher 
education deserve financial support to defray expenses that they might in better times have 
been able to handle. In the long run, this bill should benefit Maine, as it will allow more 
students to enter college, further their education, and become contributing members of our 
society.  Please support this legislation.
