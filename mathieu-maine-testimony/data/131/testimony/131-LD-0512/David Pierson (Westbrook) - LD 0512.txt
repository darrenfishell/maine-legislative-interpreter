LD 512
Hi, my name is David Pierson and I'm a professor at the University of Southern 
Maine.  I'm here to testify in support of LD 512 An Act to Promote Student 
Enrollment and Degree Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing 
Tuition Waivers to Eligible Students.  Over the past year, the University of Maine 
system has experienced significant student enrollment declines due in part to the Free 
Community College Program.  Many of our students have switched over to the 
community colleges to complete their course credits.  While Maine's community 
college tuition was always less then UMS campuses, we really cannot compete with 
free.  Our goal is to make sure that all of our students achieve their life and career 
goals, including completing a four-year degree.  UMS does not have the deep 
endowments of the private colleges, so we are more tuition dependent for our overall 
funding.  Out of fairness we ask the State of Maine to provide the same tuition 
waivers they currently provide to its community colleges.
