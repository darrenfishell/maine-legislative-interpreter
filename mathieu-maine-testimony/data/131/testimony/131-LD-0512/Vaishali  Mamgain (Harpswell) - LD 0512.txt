LD 512
I would like to express my support for LD512. I'm an economics professor and I base my 
support on the evidence that making education accessible is a way to promote economic 
growth in our state. As the oldest (demographically speaking) state in the nation it is crucial 
that our younger people are well educated, debt-free, and have high paying jobs so they can 
support the economy as the proportion of retired adults increases. Thank you for your 
consideration.
