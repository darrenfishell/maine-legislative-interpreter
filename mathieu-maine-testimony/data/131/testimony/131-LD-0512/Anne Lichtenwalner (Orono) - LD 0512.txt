LD 512
As a retired associate professor in Animal and Veterinary Science at the University of Maine, I
would like to voice my support for LD512, "An Act to Promote Student Enrollment and Degree
Completion in the University of Maine System by Providing Tuition Waivers to Eligible 
Students". 
While Maine's community colleges are a very valuable asset to the state, there are some 
academic disciplines that are best supported by allowing students to study at a 4-year 
research institution.  The University of Maine System continues to provide our Maine students
with in-state options for pre-professional and research education.  Expanding student choices
by offering waivers that can be used for UMS tuition will help our Maine undergraduates 
become successful entrants into the workforce.
