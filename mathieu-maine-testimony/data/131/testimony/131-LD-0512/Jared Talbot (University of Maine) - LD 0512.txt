LD 512
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Maine. I research in the field of 
Developmental Biology, which investigates how an egg cell becomes a baby; I teach 
a course on this topic and also a senior-level course on Histology. which is the study 
of tissues. 
In my two courses, I meet many students from the State of Maine and around the 
world with an interest in biomedical careers. Students who have come through my 
courses have gone on to work in local hospitals, research companies, and pharmacies, 
as well as in academic research careers. I have been struck by how committed the 
student body is to positively impacting the world around them, and how many 
students wish to support their local communities.
I cannot join this legislative session in-person, because I will be teaching a class 
during the session. For today's histology lesson, I have invited a former student from 
UMaine who has begun a successful career in bio-tech sector in Portland; she will 
make the case to the students that there are good options for high-paying and 
high-tech biomedical work within the state- the kind of jobs that they can obtain using
their Bachelor's degree.
This bill, LD512, will open doors to more students in our state to gain high-end local 
education; I anticipate that will help more of them continue to remain in and support 
our state. Those who come through my course are preparing to support the health 
sector, and others will gain training in the countless other sectors that dearly need a 
new generation ready to lead us into the future. 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of LD512.
Sincerely,
