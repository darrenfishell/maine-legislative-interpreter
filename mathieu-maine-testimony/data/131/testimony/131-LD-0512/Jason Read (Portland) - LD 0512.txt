While the free community college program is of great benefit to many in Maine it also
works to undermine the state university system and, more importantly, many students 
in Maine. With respect to the former the state university system has seen massive 
enrollment declines and is unable to compete with a free education. The state is 
effectively robbing Peter to pay Paul, undermining the institutions it needs to develop 
the knowledge to compete in the twenty-first century. With respect to the latter many 
students would benefit from a four year college program. Even those who transfer 
would miss out on important course work, on programs like five year degree 
completion programs in law and other Master's degrees.
