Senator Carney, Representatlve Moonen, and esteemed members of the Jud1c1ary Comm1ttee, 
thank you for allowmg me to vo1ce my support for L D 1937, "An Act to Remove the 
Conﬁdentlallty of the Transportatlon of Hazardous Materlals by Ra1lroad Compames ” of whlchI 
am a co-sponsor I am Senator R1ck Bennett, and I have the honor of serv1ng 14 commumtles 1n 
Western Marne 1n the State Senate 
Th1s b1llrepea1s the publ1c exceptlon for records related to the transportat10n of hazardous 
materlals by a rarlroad company 
In early February of th1s year, we all watched 1n horror at what happened 1n East Palestme, Oh1o 
At around 9 00 pm on Fr1day, February 3"‘ , 38 tra1n cars dera11ed, 1nclud1ng 11 that contalned 
hazardous materrals Desplte the dangerous materlals aboard, nelther the State nor the publ1c 
were notlﬁed that the tra1n was golng through because 1t had not been cons1dered a “h1gh 
hazardous materlal tra1n” 
F1rst responders at the crash s1te found ev1dence that one of the tram cars was releasmg v1nyl 
chlorlde Vmyl chlorlde 1s used to make the polyvlnyl chlorlde hard plastlc res1n used 1na 
vanety of plastlc products, 1nclud1ng p1pes, w1res and packag1ng mater1als 
On Sunday, February 5th , res1dents w1th1n a one-m1le radlus were order to evacuate One day 
later, ofﬁclals 1ssued evacuat1on orders to hundreds more res1dents near the Oh1o-Pennsylvama 
state l1ne, urgently warmng any res1dents who had declmed to leave to evacuate 1m1ned1ately 
Ofﬁc1a1s warned that a ra1l car was at r1sk of a potentlal explos1on that could launch deadly 
shrapnel as far as a m1le 
V1nyl chlorlde was slowly released from ﬁve ra1l cars 1nto a trough that was then 1gn1ted, 
creatmg a large plume above the vlllage of East Palest1ne The photos are horrlfymg 
On top of v1nyl Cl1lOI‘lClC, the 38 deralled tra1n cars were carrylng substances mcludmg butyl 
acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate and lsobutylene — all materlals 
that are wldely cons1dered to be toxlc and that have damaglng effects to both humans and the 
env1romnent 
After about ﬁve days, res1dents were told they could return to the1r homes
East Palestme F1re Ch1ef Kerth Drabrck sa1d that arr and water samples determ1ned that the 
evacuat1on area, whrch covered about a one-m1le rad1us, was safe for res1dents to return But 
Lu1surpr1s1ngly, many res1dents d1d not bel1eve that the area was safe agarn Many former 
res1dents have sa1d that they would never return 
On February 14”‘ , Oh1o's Department of Natural Resources estrmated that 3,500 dead ﬁsh had 
been found 1n local streams, tr1butar1es and waterways, account1ng for at least 12 d1fferent 
specres A week later, the department updated those ﬁgures w1th an even gr1mmer toll more than 
43,700 anrmals had d1ed w1th1n a 5-mrle area of the crash 
By the end of the month, the tra1n company, Norfolk Southem, sa1d that thousands of pounds of 
so1l and water had been removed from the s1te due to “substantlal contammatron” 
Regardrng the people of East Palestrne, famous env1romnental attomey, Er1n Brocovrch, sa1d, 
"They're worrred, because they've got coughs and resprratory problems," she sa1d "There's so 
many unanswered questlons, and they know th1s 1sn't the last of th1s conversatlon" 
Somewhat s1m1lar1y, 1n Mame, a tram dera1led about a month and a half ago, causmg a forest ﬁre 
1n Rockwood, near Moosehead Lake—the largest body of freshwater 1n our state Although there 
were hazardous materrals onboard, the deralled frerght tra1n cars were only carrylng lumber and 
w1r1ng We are very lucky that the cars carrymg hazardous materrals were not affected by the 
dera1lment and ﬁre 
Try as we mrght, acc1dents w1ll always be a part of l1fe Marners should have access to th1s v1tal 
1nformat1on If, and when, another tra1n derarls, the Ma1ne people need to know how to respond 
1f the1r health and safety 1s at r1sk
