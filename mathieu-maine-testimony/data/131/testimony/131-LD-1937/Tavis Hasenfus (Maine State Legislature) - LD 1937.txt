Testimony of Rep. T avis Hasenfus in support of 
LD 1937, An Act to Remove the Conﬁdentiality of the Transportation of Hazardous 
Materials by Railroad Companies 
Before the Judiciary Committee
x 
Good afternoon, Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Judiciary Coimnittee My 
name 1S Tavis Hasenfus, and I represent House District 57, which includes the communities of Readﬁeld 
and Winthrop I am here before you today in support of LD 1937, An Act to Remove the 
Confidentiality of the Transportation of Hazardous Materials by Railroad Companies 
With the recent derailments here in Mame, both in Leeds and Rockwood, concern from communities 
with high freight trafﬁc like mine has only increased I am particularly concemed about the Rockwood 
derailment, as reporting suggests that fuel leaked into the soil and water for days without action This 
follows other high-pro ﬁle derailments across the country, including in East Palestine, Ohio, in March 
According to the Maine Department of Transportat1on ’s December 2022 State Rail Plan, Maine’s freight 
rail system comprises 1,072 miles of tracks In 2019, DOT stated that “total rail volume reached 
approximately 4 5 million tons and 57,000 railcar loads ” While the bulk of goods shipped by rail in 
Maine were pulp and paper products and related materials, more than 500,000 tons of chemicals or 
allied products and petroleum or coal products were transported in the state by rail 
Where public information on the hazardous materials transported by freight train in Maine is severely 
limited, combined with the lack of transparency and regulation in the railroad industry nation-wide, it is 
imperative that the Legislature makes publicly available information regarding hazardous materials 
transported in the state, the routes used to transport hazardous materials and the frequeney to which they 
are shipped 
Communities like mine are rightfully concerned Making this information public would keep members 
of the public infonned and address the questions and concenis that have been raised as a result of recent 
events At minimum, someone in state govemment needs to know what hazardous materials are 
traveling throughout our state, and on what railways, so that state and local governments are prepared 
with an effective and immediate response plan should a response be needed 
Thank you for your time and attention I am happy to answer any questions you have for me.
