RE: LD 1937 – An Act to Remove the Confidentiality of the Transportation of Hazardous Materials by 
Railroad Companies  
 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and other distinguished members of the joint standing 
committee on Judiciary.   The Maine Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) is against LD 1937 – An 
Act to Remove the Confidentiality of the Transportation of Hazardous M aterials by Railroad Companies . 
Currently Federal regulation 49 CFR § 174.312 High -Hazard Flammable Trains (HHFTs) requires railroad 
companies to provide information on the movement  of trains that have ( 20) consecutive cars with Class 
3 Hazardous Materials , or ones with (35) carloads intermittently connected throughout the entire train , 
to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) for emergency response planning. While we agree that this threshold is imperfect and that it would be helpful if we were no tified of any Class 3 H azardous 
Materials , we are concerned about the potential  security risks  that could arise by removing a paragraph 
from Maine’s Freedom of Access Act , which currently defines certain records of hazardous materials 
transported by rail, the routes of that transportation, and the frequency of that transportation as not public record.  The removal of 1 MRS §402(3)(U) would make those records public and available to 
anyone upon  request, where, currently, §402(3)(U) provides that records relating to the discharge of 
hazardous material are public after  any discharge.   
We agree it is appropriate for the public to have access to information regarding any hazardous materials that have been discharged (spilled) to help first responders be safe, triage the initial response 
to any discharge, and the manage the long- term response and clean up.  We are , however , concerned 
about advertising  a “soft target” for people intent on causing harm, disrupting national transportation 
infrastructure, or other dama ge if the routes and frequency of shipments are made public.   Critical 
infrastructure , including rail, continues to be a target for Domestic Violent Extremist (DVE)  activity  and 
experts in Maine have assessed the overall risk to critical infrastructure will continue to increase in 2023. 
Due to these risks, and as outlined in the State’s 2023 -2025 Homeland Security Strategy, MEMA is 
committed to enhancing the protection of soft targets.  
We only wi sh to highlight emergency management  and homeland security  concerns, as that is our area 
of operation.  Thank you for considering our thoughts.  
Sincerely ,
