SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
Tuesday, May 30th, 2023 
Testimony of Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross presenting 
LD 193 7 An Act to Remove the Conﬁdentiality of the Transportation 
of Hazardo us Materials by Railroad Companies 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and other distinguished members 
of the Judiciary Committee I am Rachel Talbot Ross and I represent House 
District 118 which 1S the Portland neighborhoods of Parkside, Bays1de, East 
Bayside, Oakdale and the University of Southern Maine Campus and I also have 
the distinct honor of serving as Maine Speaker of the House I am here today to 
present LD 1937, An Act to Remove the Conﬁdentiality of the Transportation 
of Hazardous Materials by Railroad Companies. 
At 8 30 am on Saturday, April 15”‘ this year, a Canadian Paciﬁc freight train 
derailed outside of the northern Somerset town of Rockwood on the banks of the 
Moosehead Lake Three locomotive engines and SIX rail cars left the track sparking 
a forest ﬁre on the still snowy thawing early Spring mud The Maine Forest 
Services attributed the melting ice and debris that washed onto the tracks as the 
cause of the derailment Three railroad workers were taken to the hospital for 
minor 11‘1_]l.1l‘16S The Maine Forest Services also reported that there were additional 
rail cars carrying hazardous materials, but since they were not leaking, catching 
ﬁre, or at risk to the public - those details remained conﬁdential 
The news story was of heightened concern for many Mainers familiar witha 
catastrophic train derailment _]1lSll a few weeks prior in a small eastern Ohio town 
between Cleveland and Pittsburgh Details of the effects of that train crash were 
still being released as the public became was becoming more aware of the severity 
of the chemicals being transported Vinyl chloride was a new and terrifying word 
Many were quick to google to ﬁnd out that vinyl chloride breaks down into two 
chemicals hydrogen chloride and phosgene Phosgene being highly poisonous 
colorless gas used in chemical Warfare during World War I Butyl acrylate, a liquid 
used for making paint, adhesives, and sealants, was found in local surface water 
District 118: Portland neighborhoods of Parkside, Bayside, East Bayside, Oakdale and 
the University of Southern Maine Campus
V1deos went v1ral of 011 sheens of creeks that tr1butar1es of the Oh1o R1ver As 
many 1n Ma1ne were hearmg of the tram derallment 1n the amuslng soundlng 
townsh1p of Sandw1ch Grant Academy, they wondered 1f what they were seelng 
happen 1n Oh1o was about to happen at the1r own homes 
But the news never came There was no alarm, no evacuatlon alerts, and not 
even a ‘do not drrnk’ adv1sory The publ1c had been reassured by the Mame Forest 
Servlces that the hazardous mater1als on the tram that day were not at r1sk to the 
pLll'JllC, so there was no need to worry about them It seems as though Malne 
dodged a bullet that day 
Sadly, th1s has become a common occurrence nat1onw1de Accord1ng to the 
Federal Rallroad Adm1n1strat1on, there were at least 1,164 tra1n derallments 1n the 
Unlted States alone last year — roughly three derallments a day Rarlroads 
meanwh1le are abandonlng 1ndustry safety pract1ces to save money, such as 
1ncreas1ng tra1n lengths and reduc1ng crew s1zes And w1th dera1lments becomlng 
more common, the ra1l mdustry 1s workmg to keep from the publ1c any knowledge 
of a reason to be concerned about what 1s happenlng 
Back 1n Rockwood, wlth ground ﬁrm1ng up and heavy machlnery able to 
ﬁnally clear the wreckage, cleanup seems to have come It has been an arduous 
process An Apr1l 18*“ Mame DEP press release detalled the 1mpacts of the 
wreckage 1n the area Fuel, hydrauhc ﬂu1d and eng1ne 011 from the dera1led eng1nes 
saturated the so1l and sp1lled1nto Moose Rlver B1olog1sts from Ma1ne Department 
of Inland F1sher1es & W1ldl1fe were needed to survey the area to understand the 
1mpacts to w1ldl1fe Canad1an Paclﬁc assured the publ1c that they were on the scene 
and taklng lead to the response 
On Aprll 20*“ , DEP Comm1ss1oner Melanle Loyzlm sent a letter to Canad1an 
Pac1fic’s Hazmat & Emergency Response Ofﬁcer 
T0 date, CPKC and/or thezr contractors fazled to meet Department 
expectatzons regardzng tzmzng and response of clean-up acttvztzes zn order to 
eﬂectzvely mztzgate zmpacts to the envzronment and pubhc health, dzrectzves 
that the Department has zssued tn order to meet the Commzsszoner ’s 
satzsfactzon have not been attended to or completed 
The letter cont1nues to state that Mame DEP 1s havlng to step 1n wrth the lack of 
urgency that Canad1an Paclﬁc has had w1th the Rockwood cleanup The letter also 
stated that the two cars conta1n1ng hazardous materlals st1ll had yet to be moved
away from the wreckage Even though the wreckage was causmg lmpacts on 
pub11c health, because the two tankers conta1n1ng hazardous materlals were not 
actrvely leakmg or on ﬁre, the Mame government had no obl1gat1on to share the 
deta11s of what l1qu1d was attached to a tra1n derallment A spokesperson for 
Canadran Paclﬁc may not have been consulted by the1r legal team, and shared 1n an 
1nterv1ew w1th the AP on Apr11 1611‘ — the two dera1led cars carr1ed the ﬂammable 
l1qu1ds of ethanol and pentamethylheptane 
Ethanol H1gh1y ﬂammable In event of a ra11 car ﬁre, rsolate for ‘/2 m11e 1n 
all d1rect1ons Vo1at11e chemlcals have a h1gh rlsk of be1ng asplrated 1nto the 
v1ct1m's lungs dur1ng vom1t1ng wh1ch lncreases the med1ca1 problems 
Pentamethylheptane H1ghly ﬂammable W111 be eas1ly 1gn1ted by heat, 
sparks or ﬂames Vapors may form explos1ve mrxtures w1th a1r Vapors may 
travel to source of 1gn1t1on and ﬂash back Most vapors are heav1er than a1r 
They W111 spread along the ground and collect 1n low or conﬁned areas 
(sewers, basements, tanks) Contalners may explode when heated In event 
of a ra1l car ﬁre, 1solate for 1/2 m1le 1n all d1rect1ons Contact may 1rr1tate 
skm, eyes, and mucous membranes Used as a solvent 
Because of an except1on to Ma1ne’s Freedom of Access Laws , the pub11c had no 
r1ght to know about these two tankers and the 1mm1nent danger they could have 
caused Only by chance of an overworked press staffer do we even know what 
could have been a new natronal ‘word of the day’ , _]LlS1l llke v1nyl chlorrde 
We can’t blame the ra1l compan1es entlrely for the recent dera1lments Even 
w1th all the recent events, ra1l 1s st11l by far the safest way to transport the volume 
of hazardous mater1als across long d1stances The problem 1s that the federal 
govemment has not made the mvestment 1n ma1nta1n1ng the ra11 l1nes Regardless, 
we need transparency 1n the transportat1on of hazardous materrals through our 
commumty People have a rlght to know 
Pr1or to the enactment of the pub11c records exceptron of the transportat1on 
of hazardous materrals by rallroad companres, Mame had an actlve not1ﬁcat1on 
system where no ma11ce had occurred W1th Mame be1ng among the nat1on’s 
largest exportmg states due 1ts prox1m1ty between the westem 011 ﬁelds and the 
Irv1ng 011 reﬁnery 1n St John, New B1'L1l’lSW1Cl(, ra1l 011 tanker’s makmg the1r way 
through the Mame North Woods has been a common occurrence But on July 6, 
2013, Just 10 m11es from the northem Frank11n County border, a fre1ght tra1n 
carryrng crude 011 dera1led 1n the town Quebec town of Lac-Mégant1c causlng a
massive explosron Heat from the ﬁres was felt 1 2 m11es away from the wreckage 
47 total people per1shed 
At that po1nt 1n t1me, c1t1zens demanded to know more 1nformat1on about 
trams passmg through the1r commumtles In 2015, the Ma1ne Leglslature 
responded by passmg LD 484 “An Act Regardlng the Conﬁdent1al1ty of Rallroad 
Carrler Cargo” Th1s leg1slat1on was submltted by and for the beneﬁclal and 
conﬁdentlal use of the ra1l mdustry, accord1ng to a 2016 P1ne Tree Watch 
1nterv1ew between the sponsor of the b1ll The b1ll sponsor also testrﬁed to th1s as 
fact 1n h1s remarks to th1s commlttee, “The slmple fact 1s there 1s a great deal of 
compet1t10n 1n the sh1pp1ng bus1ness and d1sclos1ng pubhcly what, how much and 
how often you are transport1ng a product can be a ser1ous compet1t1ve 
dlsadvantage” 
The leg1slat1on passed unanlmously 1n commlttee and then through the 
legrslature Former Governor Paul LePage vetoed the leg1slat1on when 1t came to 
h1s desk He stated 1n h1s letter to the leglslature 
One of the hallmarks of my admtntstratzon has been transparency tn 
government, another has been the protectzon of Mazne cttzzens I cannot 
support a bzll that ts tnconststent wzth these goals When tnformatzon about 
hazardous cargo traveltng through thzs State ts tn possesston of ﬁrst 
responders and/or emergency management entttzes, zt ts hzghly posszble that 
one reason these entztzes have thzs znformatzon tn the ﬁrst place ts that 
somethtng has gone wrong I am not at all comfortable shteldtng thts 
znformatton from the Mame ctttzens that may be placed tn harm ’s what by 
these transports 
The veto was overr1dden 146-1 1n the House and 31-4 1n the Senate The 
House agreed w1th the b1ll sponsor’s comments on the ﬂoor, “It 1s proprletary 
mformatron that buslnesses 1n Mame do not want to share w1th other folks” 
In 2019, there was foreslght by the Rlght to Know Advrsory Comm1ttee 
recognlzmg that the statute needed a clar1fy1ng add1t1on 
“ except that records related to a dtscharge of hazardous materzals 
transported by a ratlroad company that poses a threat to publzc health, 
safety, and welfare are subject to publzc dzsclosure after that dtscharge”
The Judlclary Commlttee made th1s exceptlon to the publ1c records 
except1on to rev1ew hazardous materlal shlpments, 1f and only 1f 1t poses a threat to 
publ1c health, safety, and welfare are S1ll)_]€Ct to pubhc dlsclosure after that 
d1scharge 
That except1on 1s _]LlS'[ too late when there’s poss1b1l1ty of II1&_]O1' catastrophlc 
health rrsks to a reglon The add1t1on to the exceptron 1s only golng to be when the 
effects of the gas leak, the o1l sprllage, or the explos1ve ﬁre columns are already 
occumng We should not W1tness what happened 1n East Pa1est1ne and Rockwood 
and understand that only when a d1saster 1s takrng place 1s when the publ1c hasa 
r1ght to know That 1s an 1rrespons1ble act1on for publ1c servants to make when 
th1nk1ng about the health and well-be1ng of the people who we represent

LD 1937 “An Act to Remove the Conﬁdentlallty of the Transportatron of 
Hazardous Materlals by Ra1lroad Compan1es ” W111 slmply enough repeal the publ1c 
except1on for records related to the transportatron of hazardous materlals bya 
rarlroad company Consldermg recent events and the stat1st1ca1 h1gh l1kel1hood of 
another tra1n derallment, I have added an emergency preamble to thls legrslatlon so 
that 1mmed1ately upon the b1ll becommg law, the p11bllC has a rlght to know what 
hazardous mater1als are bemg transported near the1r home 
Th1s common-sense solutlon 1s ﬁxmg a recent error 1n the leglslature I hope 
that We all can thmk forward 1n cons1der1ng a proactlve actlon that We can act on 
now to ﬁx the concem for publ1c health before a catastrophlc event were to take 
place Thank you for t1me and attentlon
