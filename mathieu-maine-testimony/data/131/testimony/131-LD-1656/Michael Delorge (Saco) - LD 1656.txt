Senator
Raf ferty ,
Representative
Brennan,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Education
and
Cultural
Af fairs,
greetings.
My
name
is
Michael
Delor ge
and
I
am
a
current
third-year
under graduate
at
the
University
of
Maine.
I
ur ge
you
to
support
LD
1656
to
increase
the
student
voice
within
the
University
of
Maine
System
Board
of
T rustees.
While
I
am
the
current
V ice
President
of
the
University
of
Maine
Student
Government,
my
views
are
my
own
and
do
not
reflect
that
of
any
or ganization
or
student
group
at
the
University .
From
my
first
day
at
the
University
of
Maine,
I
have
sought
to
get
involved
on
campus
to
overcome
the
isolation
presented
by
COVID-19.
I’ve
worked
the
polls
in
both
national
elections
held
on
campus
in
the
past
three
years,
researched
the
state’ s
substance
use
epidemic,
gotten
involved
in
student
government,
applied
for
grants
and
scholarships,
achieved
impressive
marks
in
my
classes,
completed
internships,
ran
a
student
or ganization,
fostered
friendships,
made
lasting
memories,
and
even
found
time
to
sleep
a
bit.
This
is
a
student
schedule.
Students
are
superheroes
and
my
peers
at
the
University
of
Maine
are
no
exception.
They
are
qualified
to
hold
voting
roles
on
the
Board
of
T rustees
and
have
shown
impressive
leadership,
resilience,
and
dedication
to
their
school
when
facing
barriers
such
as
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
In
addition
to
their
qualifications,
students
deserve
a
seat
at
the
table.
Currently ,
having
only
one
student
member
of
the
Board
of
T rustees
does
not
of fer
enough
representation
to
reflect
the
diverse
set
of
experiences
felt
by
students
from
across
the
University
of
Maine
system
—
from
nursing
under graduates
at
the
University
of
Fort
Kent
down
to
the
graduate
students
at
Maine
Law
in
Portland
and
everywhere
in
between.
Students
pay
a
greater
total
share
to
the
University
of
Maine
System
than
the
state
of
Maine,
but
have
no
elected
representation
and
no
say
in
how
their
tuition
dollars
are
spent.
Students
deserve
a
vote,
a
voice,
and
seat
at
the
table.
I
am
grateful
to
be
a
student
at
the
University
of
Maine,
and
I
hope
that
you
will
support
LD
1656
to
ensure
that
students
within
the
University
of
Maine
System
have
a
vote
and
a
voice
in
administrative
decisions.
Sincerely ,
Michael
Delor ge
Saco,
