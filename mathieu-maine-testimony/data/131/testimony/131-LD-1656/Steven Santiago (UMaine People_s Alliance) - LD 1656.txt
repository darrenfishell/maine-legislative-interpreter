LD 1656
Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs.
We are UMaine People’s Alliance, a group of student activists on the University of 
Maine campus and we are demanding change. LD 1656 ought to pass. 
As activists on campus we believe in democratic ideals. Ideals not lived up to by the 
UMS. For 48% of the budget, we get very little say on what happens at our 
universities. We believe that for that share of funding, we should get a proportionate 
share of representation. 10 students members is still not a majority. But it is a good 
share of representation. This is not only equitable, but just. 
LD 1656 ought to pass because students make up the future of our state. It is only 
right that they get to decide that future through just representation. We shouldn’t pay 
the lion’s share of the budget for a mere whisper on what that money is spent on. 
Students' voices are demanding to be heard. It is up to you whether or not to listen to 
what they have to say. We suggest that you listen to the voices of the future so that 
they know they have one.
Thank you, honorable members of the committee.
