As a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Maine, I know first hand what it 
is like to learn, work, and live in a system in which you have no representation, and 
no clear avenue to enact change. Providing students with a seat at the decision making
table would create a better University of Maine system; students know best what is 
happening on their campuses, so it is time to provide students with a voice, by 
allowing student representation within the governance of UMS.
