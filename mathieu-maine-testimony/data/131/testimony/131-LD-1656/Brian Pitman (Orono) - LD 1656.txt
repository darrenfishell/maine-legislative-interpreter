LD 1656
Dear Maine State Legislature, 
First, this comment is in my capacity as a private citizen. I am writing in support of 
LD1656 to increase student representation on the Board of Trustees. Given the 
amount of money students pay the university system (it is more than the state pays 
into the system), students should have a say on the BoT. In my experience, students 
are well-equipped to know what is needed on campus for themselves and for those in 
the broader community. Additionally, many public universities already have 
student-elected trustees. Given the increasing reliance student tuition continues to be 
on the UMS budget, they deserve to have significant representation on the board. 
They are our future and we do not have a university system without our students. 
Thank you.
