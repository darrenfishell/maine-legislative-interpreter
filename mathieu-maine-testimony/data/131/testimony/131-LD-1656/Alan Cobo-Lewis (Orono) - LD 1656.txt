Chairman Rafferty, Chairman Brennan, Distinguished Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Education and Cultural Affairs:  
My name is Alan Cobo -Lewis. I live in Orono. I am testifying for LD 1656  An Act to Allow Student 
Representation Within the Governance of the University of Maine System.  
While I am testifying in my personal capacity, my testimony is informed by my long experience 
in higher education: four years as an undergraduate at a private institution of higher education, 
four more as a graduate student at a public institution of higher education, a year as a post -doc 
at a private institution of higher education, five as a faculty member of a private institution of 
higher education, and 25 a s a faculty member of a public institution of higher education â€”the 
University of Maine.  
LD 1656 is intriguing. While perhaps the most obvious aspect is the sheer number of student 
representatives it proposes for the Board of Trustees. I leave discussion ab out the appropriate 
number to other parties. But there are two other crucial aspects of the bill that I would like to 
highlight and call out for support:  
Specific Constituencies  
The bill recognizes that grad students and undergraduate students have differe nt perspectives 
and needs on the University of Maine System, and it appropriately designates separate student 
representatives from those constituencies. This is an excellent idea, and I hope the Committee 
endorses it .  
Election  
The bill proposes that stude nt representatives be chosen by student election. I strongly support 
democracy, and I endorse this aspect of the bill as well. Elections keep all of you in touch with 
your constituents, and elections hold the promise of keeping the student representatives in 
touch with their constituents.
