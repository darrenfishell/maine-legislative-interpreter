Testimony supporting LD 35, "An Act to Establish Adult Protective Services Training 
Requirements for Professionals Mandated to Report Suspected Abuse, Neglect or Exploitation to 
Enhance Protection of Incapacitated and Dependent Adults" 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and the distinguished members of the Committee on 
Health and Human Services:
My name is Rachel Dyer, and I am the associate director of the Maine Developmental 
Disabilities Council. Councils on Developmental Disabilities were created through the 
Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) in 1970.  Maineâ€™s DD 
Council has been advocating with and for individuals with developmental disabilities for over 50 
years.  The DD Council is a federally funded, independent organization with members from 
across the state, including persons with disabilities, family members, and representatives of 
public and private agencies which provide services and/or funding for services for individuals 
with developmental disabilities.  As required in federal law, we are involved in advocacy, 
capacity building and systemic change activities, with the goal that individuals with 
developmental and other disabilities of all ages are fully included, integrated, and involved in 
their communities and the decisions impacting their lives.  
Individuals with developmental disabilities experience abuse, neglect, and exploitation at 
endemic rates. Mandated reporting is a well-recognized role in identifying and responding to 
abuse. Mandated reporters understanding of the expectations of their role has the potential to 
improve abuse reporting and response. Training is one tool to increase understanding and skills. 
Thank you for this opportunity to testify.
