Sen. Baldacci, Rep. Meyer and distinguished members of the Health and Human Services 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Graham, and I am providing testimony in support for LD 35, An Act To 
Establish Adult Protective Services Training Requirements for Professionals Mandated to Report 
Suspected Abuse, Neglect or Exploitation to Enhance Protection of Incapacitated and Dependent Adults, 
on behalf of Maine Municipal Association which represents the collective interest of municipal 
government. 
Municipal government service provision requires a number of employees to have consistent 
mandated reporter training under existing child protection laws. Employees from codes enforcement 
officers to public safety officials all encounter residents with varying needs and concerns often 
discovered in the course of normal municipal duties. In and aging state, vulnerable adults are a 
frequently encountered, and often there is concern on how to engage best with services that may be 
able to help, particularly when the individual may be under coercive control. Officials feel training and 
understanding of the available reporting avenues would be very beneficial. 
Mandatory reporter training is already required every four years for suspected child abuse and 
neglect and provided by a private company formerly called JPMA for law enforcement, corrections, first 
responders and security officers. This is a subscription service there is a fee to access that training and 
manage the credentialling. Officials ask that should the committee move forward with this bill that they 
also include an option that does not require a subscription service to aid those entities that may not 
have access to the portal. This is done currently for the universal non-LEO standards, under the 
mandated child abuse program via an online portal available here:

Officials hope that the barrier for the new training will be as simple as the child abuse training 
and that the state will have adequate resources to investigate those reports as well.
