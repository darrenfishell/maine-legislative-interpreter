Neither For Nor Against  
LD 1538 , An Act to Provide Tax Benefits to Persons Constructing Accessory Dwelling Units   
 
May 10, 2023  
 
Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Kate Dufour, and I am offering testimony neither for nor against LD 1538  on behalf of 
the 70 municipal leaders who were elected by their peers to serve on the Associa tion’s 
Legislative Policy Committee and directed to establish MMA’s position on bills of municipal 
interest.   
Municipal officials appreciate that LD 1538  presents a housing inventory solution that 
focuses on incentiv es rather than mandates and could assist in the development  of the seasonal  
workforce  housing  that is desperately needed in Maine ’s tourist communities.   
However, local leaders  question what role assess ors might play to support the state’s 
implementation  efforts . As evidenced by  the Sen ior Property T ax Stabilization  program,  the 
devil and work are in the details when it comes  to the implementation  of presumed  straight -
forward proposals .   
  Furthermore , as history is prone to repeat itself, municipal officials are concerned the 
program will suffer the same fate the Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement did when it 
morphed into the Business Equipment Tax Exemption, thereby reducing by 50% the tax revenue 
collected on qualifying bus iness equipment.  Municipalities cannot  afford another reduction in 
property tax reven ue.   
Thank you for considering the municipal perspective on this issue.  If you have any 
questions about our position, please contact me at kdufour@memun.org  or 1-800-452-8786.
