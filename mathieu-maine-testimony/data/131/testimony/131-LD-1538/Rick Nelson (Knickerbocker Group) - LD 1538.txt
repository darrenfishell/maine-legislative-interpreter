Good mormng, Senator Grohowskr, Representatrve Perry, and D1stmgu1shed/ Esteemed Members 
of the Jomt Standmg Oomrmttee on Taxatron, my name 1s Rrck Nelson I am a Mame Lrcensed 
Archrtect and archrtecture practrce leader at the Kmckerbocker Group I am here to speak 1n 
support of LD 1538, “An Act to Provrde Tax Benefrts to Persons Gonstructrng Accessory Dwellmg 
Umts” 
I have been wrth the company for nearly 18 years and we have 120 employees, all contnbutmg to 
housmg m Mame As a 100% employee-owned ﬁrm, our team of year-round 1VIame resrdents 1s 
heavlly rnvested rn 1VIa1ne’s future and the rmpact we have throughout our commumtles 
The combrnatron of mcreased out-of-state buyers, clrmbmg home pnces, rrsrng mterest rates, and 
low housrng rnventory has led to a housmg crrsrs 1n our state that rs predlcted to last for decades As 
demand contmues to nse, Marners wrll rncreasrngly struggle to fmd and afford homes These 
unpacts, coupled wrth the threat of nsrng energy costs and rnflatron (and the ongorng, elevated costs 
m constructron matenal and labor), are dnvrng the need not Just for housmg, but for smart, cost- 
effectrve, and energy-effrcrent housmg solutrons 
For those who already own land m the state, we have an enormous opporttmrty to add housmg 
srmply by mcreasmg densrty wrth ADUs Homeowners 1n rural and semr-rural regrons have the 
space on therr propertres for these smart solutrons Recent bills have allowed for addrtronal densrty 
on these srtes, yet due to regulatory structures and processes (whrch are 1n place for good reason) 
Mame wrll contlnue to have hrgh demand fo' r housrng for many years to come 
Thrs past year, our company decrded to do our part We made a commrtment to mcreasrng the 
number and affordabrlrty of quahty hvrng solutrons for Mamers Kmckerbocker Group now offers 
Prefab Pods - ADUs and hvmg spaces — constructed at our 1n-state prefabrrcatron facrlrty rn 
Vﬁscassett and dehvered m a 5 to 10-week trmeframe Upon launch of our 500 and 800 sq ft models, 
we saw rmmedrate and hrgh demand 
Yet for many Marners, the fmancrals strll do not add up We need rncentrves to help our fellow 
Mamers These rncentrves wrll help our elderly parents, who can move mto an ADU m therr 
backyard to free up therr larger, famrly home for therr adult chrldren and therr krds, who need 
housmg These mcentrves are for new college graduates or young, workrng professronals retumrng to 
Mame to rarse therr famrly here These rncentrves wrll help our workforce housmg, as a leased ADU 
can become a much-needed rncome-stream to help owners keep up wrth our hrgh cost of lrvmg. 
These smart solutrons wrll work for hundreds of Mamers 1n non-urban settrngs, 1f we can support 
them wrth thrs mcentrve Thrs brll wrll make an rmpact by startrng to close the cntrcal housmg gap 
The legrslature has made excellent progress and supportmg thrs measure wrll only brrng our state 
that much closer to provrdmg cost-effectrve, smart housmg solutrons for so many Thank you.
