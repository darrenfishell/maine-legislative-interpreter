Before the J ornt Standrng Comrmttee on Taxatlon 
May 10, 2023 
Senator Grohoskr, Representatlve Perry, and D1st1ngu1shed Colleagues on the J o1nt Standrng 
Commrttee on Taxatron, my name 1s Stacy Brenner I represent Senate D1str1ct 30, whrch rncludes 
all of Gorham and most of Scarborough I am here to rntroduce LD 1538, “An Act to Prov1de Tax 
Beneﬁts to Persons Constructrng Accessory Dwelllng Umts” 
Thrs legrslatron would allow for a rermbursement by the State for a percentage of the property taxes 
pard as a result of the constructlon of an accessory dwellrng unrt, whrch I w1ll refer to as an ADU 
ADUs would be deﬁned as, 1) an attached or detached dwellmg un1t on the same lot or parcel as an 
exrstrng or proposed srngle-famlly or multr-famrly resrdence that allows for, 2) rndependent l1v1ng 
for one or more persons and, 3) contams krtchen and bathroom fac1l1t1es and sleeprng 
accomrnodatrons 
The arm of thrs leglslatlon 1s to help address the lack of affordable hous1ng 1n Marne Th1s b1ll 
would 1ncent1v1ze burlders to construct lower cost, affordable housrng We have the abrlrty to help 
create more supply 1n the current market by encouragrng Marne resrdents to burld ADUs that could 
house fam1l1es 1n need Nat1onw1de, medran rent mcreased by 22 percent between the years of 2016 
and 2021 In that same trme, medran household mcomes have grown by only 15 percent Marne 
Housmg estrmates that 1n 2022, the state gpproxrmately 20.000 to 25 .000 umts short of what 1t 
would take to solve the affordable housrng cr1s1s Incentrvrzmg the constructlon of ADUs would 
allow more resrdents access to housrng 
Th1s b1ll would also help the average Marne famrly partlcrpate more readrly 1n berng a part of the 
solutron to the housmg cr1s1s through a drstrrbuted approach 1n the mvestment and constructron of 
new umts By expandlng access1b1l1ty for resrdents all over the state to bu1ld ADUs, we can work 
together to address thrs mountrng rssue affectmg so many members of our communrtres 
There are two suggestrons for potentral amendments that I belreve are Worth cons1der1ng One came 
ﬁ'om Marne Equal Justrce who proposed mcludmg the chrld, s1bl1ng, or parent of the homeowner 
under the sect1on on requlrements And, the other proposed amendment 1s to lnclude language about 
mcome el1g1b1l1ty of the tenant to qualrfy for the rehef 
Thank you for your trme and consrderatron
