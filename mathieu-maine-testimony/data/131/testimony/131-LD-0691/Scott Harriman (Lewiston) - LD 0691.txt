Good
morning
Senat or
Carne y ,
Repr esentativ e
Moonen,
and
distinguished
members
of
the
Joint
Standing
Committee
on
Judiciar y .
My
name
is
Scott
Harriman
and
I
am
writing
in
suppor t
of
LD
691,
“ An
Act
t o
Reduce
Barriers
t o
Housing
b y
Pr ohibiting
T enant
Application
F ees. ”
Maine ’ s
housing
mark et
is
extr emely
tight
and
people
looking
for
an
apar tment
must
often
apply
t o
many
diff er ent
openings
in
the
hopes
of
hearing
back
fr om
at
least
one
of
them.
Giv en
that
application
f ees
typically
r ange
between
$25
and
$50,
this
quickly
adds
up
t o
an
expense
of
se v er al
hundr ed
dollars.
This
r epr esents
a
r eal
har dship
for
many
people,
especially
coupled
with
the
need
t o
come
up
with
thr ee
months’
r ent
befor e
mo ving
int o
a
new
apar tment.
I
also
ha v e
the
perspectiv e
of
working
as
a
landlor d
her e
in
Lewist on.
Despite
what
is
common
pr actice,
I
do
not
char ge
application
f ees
because
I
don ’t
f eel
lik e
the y
ar e
necessar y .
Monthly
r ental
amounts
pr o vide
mor e
than
enough
for
landlor ds
t o
co v er
this
minor
expense
—
ther e
is
no
need
for
them
t o
collect
hundr eds
of
dollars
mor e
just
t o
e v aluate
r ental
applicants.
Please

Ought

Thank
