To The Distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee 
From Daniel J. Bernier, representing the 
Central Maine Apartment Owners Association working in conjunction with the Rental 
Housing Alliance of Southern Maine, the Greater Bangor Area Owners’ and Managers ’ 
Association, the Capital Area Housing Association, and Lewiston Aubum Landlord 
Association. 
Re: LD 691 An Act to Reduce Barriers to Housing by Prohibiting Tenant Application Fees 
I am submitting this memo in opposition to this legislation. 
On tenant application fees, some apartment owners feel landlords should not charge 
them, some feel it is OK to charge the fee for just what the services charge you, or what it 
would cost you to run a credit report and others are turning a proﬁt on it. The problem is this 
takes the legislature down the road of micromanaging how apartment owners run their 
business. Apartment owners who do not charge application fees will have a competitive 
advantage over those who do. That is how this will be solved. Rather than working of 
inuendo, we need to ﬁnd out more of what is going on with application fees. Are they more 
common in certain areas of the state? Are they more common among larger landlords than the 
smaller local landlords ‘? How prevalent are they? 
We should let the market work this situation out. The legislature starting down the road 
of micromanaging tenant screening is likely to be a big deterrent to investment. Apartment 
owners have the basic property right to screen people before renting to them. They have an 
obligation to their current tenant’s safety to do tenant screening. 
Thank you for your time and I would be happy to answer any questions on this 
legislation. 
Very truly yours, 
Da i J. Bernier
