Julie Moulton
Westbrook
LD 691
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Judiciary Committee: My name is Julie Moulton I am a resident of Westbrook and I am writing
in today to testify in favor of LD 701.
Regretfully, I cannot attend via Zoom or in person due to my work schedule, but feel it is very 
important to speak personally on behalf of many of the families I serve who are experiencing 
homelessness who do not have the extra income to spend up front on application fees in 
order to have a chance at securing a home. It is becoming a huge barrier to equal 
opportunities in housing. As we all know, the housing market is Maine is tight and low-income
Mainers are the hardest hit in the rental market. Yesterday, just one apartment application fee
submitted for a family totaled $120- consisting of a $60 fee for each applicant over the age of 
18 in the household. This is not out of the ordinary. Non-refundable fees such as this offer no 
guarantee the family will be accepted for tenancy. If the unit is then not offered to the family, 
they will have to apply to another unit and pay those fees. This is extremely difficult for many 
and is impossible for others who have no source of income to pay application fees for housing
who become stuck in a discouraging cycle of hopelessness in their search for housing. I 
understand there are background check fees and costs of doing business for landlords, but I 
truly believe application fees should not be charged up front, especially when automatic 
payments are required online and upfront before it is determined whether a tenant is a true 
candidate for the unit. I would also like to take a moment to express gratitude and 
acknowledge the landlords and property managers out there who do not charge application 
fees or are willing to delay application fees until a unit is offered to the tenant and accepted. 
We appreciate and thank you and the committee.
