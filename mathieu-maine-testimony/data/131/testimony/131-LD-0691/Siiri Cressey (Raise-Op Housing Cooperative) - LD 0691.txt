LD 691
Representative Kessler, committee members;
My name is Siiri Cressey. I am a resident of Lewiston. I am testifying in support of LD 691, a 
ban on charging prospective residential tenants application fees.
There are many people in need of a place to live which they can afford. I personally know at 
least one who did not submit an application for a specific apartment because they could not 
afford to pay the application fee. I think responsible, considerate landlords + landladies should
make it easier for those searching for housing to get into an apartment, not harder.
