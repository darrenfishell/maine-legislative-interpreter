LD 1690
LD 1690 - An Act Regarding Ongoing Absentee Voting and Tracking of Absentee 
Ballots, LINDA HASKELL, I oppose the attempt to change LD1690. Another 
attempt to change the strength of our Maine Constitution to have a just and honest 
election. Democrats sponsoring and co-sponsoring this bill, this is a disgrace to the 
legislative branch. The time spent trying to destroy the fair and just election process, 
which we have used for years, SHOULD  be spent on laws beneficial for a more 
productive welfare of this State of Maine and our election integrity.  LINDA 
HASKELL, Garland  Testimony to oppose!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
