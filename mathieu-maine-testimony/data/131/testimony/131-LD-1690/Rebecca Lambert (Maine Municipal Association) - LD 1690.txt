In Opposition to  
 
LD 1690 - An Act Regarding Ongoing Absentee Voting and Tracking of Absentee Ballots  
 
April 26, 2023  
 
 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Rebecca Lambert, and I am providing testimony in opposition to  LD 1 690 on behalf 
of the Maine Municipal Associationâ€™s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legisla tive Policy Committee (LPC). For 
reference , the LPC provides direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills 
of municipal interest.    
The ease with which a voter can obtain an absentee ballot is already available to all voters and 
ongoing absentee status is available for those over the age of 65 and for people with disabilities. 
Furthermore, a tracking system already exists for absentee ballots and the LPC feel that this bill is a solution in search of a problem and essentially unnecessary.  
MMA understands that the Maine Town & City Clerks Association is also opposed to this legislation 
and stand in support of our affiliate group partner.  
Thank  you for your time and considering the municipal perspective on this issue.
