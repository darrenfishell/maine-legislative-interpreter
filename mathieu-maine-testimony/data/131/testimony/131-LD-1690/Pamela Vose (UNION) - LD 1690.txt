UNION
LD 1690
My name is Pamela Vose and I am a resident of Union, Maine.  
I am testifying today in strong support of LD 1690 - An Act Regarding Ongoing 
Absentee Voting and Tracking of Absentee Ballots
As a committed voter, I feel that it is important for every eligible voter to participate 
in the voting process. Throughout different stages of my life I have made every effort 
to vote in every election and I considered it my civic duty.  There were times when it 
was almost impossible to accomplish without a great deal of coordination because of 
circumstances outside of my control.   Once I became old enough to vote by absentee 
ballot; I found out how easy and secure the process was.  It would be a great service 
to allow any voter who wants to receive an absentee ballot automatically to be able to 
do so.
I feel strongly that anything that can be done to make it easier for voters to participate 
in our democracy should be done.   I urge you to vote Ought to Pass on this bill.
Thank you.
