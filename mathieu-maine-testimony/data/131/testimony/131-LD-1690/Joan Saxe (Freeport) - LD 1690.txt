Senator Hickman., Representative  Supica  and members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs 
Committee, my name is Joan B. Saxe. I live Freeport and I am presenting my testimony 
today in support of LD 1690, An Act Regarding Ongoing Absentee Voting and 
Tracking of Absentee Ballots.  
 
I have rarely submitted an absentee ballot, believing that going to the polls in person is an 
important right and privilege of voting in a democracy.   On occasion, I have enjoyed the  
convenience of voting at Freeport’s town hall prior to the stated voting date, as  I am often 
visiting family in Oregon in November.  Oregon by the way has since 1987  
   
 
 
 
Absentee voting is convenient, and allowing voters to receive a ballot in advance of each and 
every election without a separate request would make it even more so. It is an increasingly 
popular option for so many voters — those whose work requires travel, people with mobility 
challenges, busy people juggling work, family, and other demands, people with compromised 
immune systems, and so many of us for whom voting is so important that we just don’t want 
to wait until the last minute. 
 
 
Thank you for your consideration.
