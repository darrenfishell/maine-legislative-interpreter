HE: LD1690: An Act Regarding Ongoing Absentee Voting and Tracking of Absentee 
Ballotsâ€™ 
Good morning Senator Hickman, Representative Supica and members of the 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs. 
My name is Julia Fitz-Fiandolph and l am here today as a volunteer representing the 
Maine Unitarian Universalist State Advocacy Network (known as MUUSAN), which links 
over 500 individuals in 26 churches across the state in faith-based advocacy. I am 
testifying in support of LD1690. 
As one of several Maine faith-based organizations concerned about the protection of 
our democracy, MUUSAN prioritizes legislation that affirms justice and inclusion. 
Democracy is never guaranteed and the people of Maine deserve safe and open 
access to exercising their right to vote. 
In Maine, any voter may request an absentee ballot, however, they must do so every 
time they wish to vote absentee, creating an unnecessary burden on voters. An on- 
going absentee mailing list will increase access to the ballot, especially for voters in 
rural areas, voters with disabilities, and others who struggle to access polling places. 
Absentee voting is on the rise, nationwide and in Maine. l live in Pemaquid and am one 
of them. 
According to the Mainers for Modern Elections Coalition research, mail ballot voters 
turnout at higher rates than polling place voters, participate in off-year elections ata 
higher rate, and on-going absentee mailing lists increased the likelihood that voters will 
participate in the next election._ 
We urge the Committee to vote to Pass LD 1690. 
Thank you
