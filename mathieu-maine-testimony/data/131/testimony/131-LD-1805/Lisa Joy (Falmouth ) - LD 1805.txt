MAGA Nation, which has co-opted the name of the Republican Party thanks to 
billionaires/dark money donors and their well-paid strategic operatives, needs to cease
and desist: excusing the January 6 insurrection by its own members - those elected 
and those armed; gerrymandering districts; spreading 2020 election lies; fomenting 
distrust in federal officers and agencies; spewing hatred towards members of the 
Democratic Party; undoing decades of legal precedents protecting citizens from 
industry corruption, industrial pollution, inequality under the law, rule of White men, 
etc.; seizing control of election processes in “Red” states; banning books; and, 
attempting to exert control over federal election funding after October 1 here in the 
State of Maine.
This Committee should not move this unnecessary bill forward.
Thank you.
