Senator
Ingwersen,
Representative
Plueker
and
members
of
the
Agriculture,
Conservation
and
Forestry
Committee:
My
name
is
Andy
Smith
and
my
partner
Caitlin
Frame
and
I
own
The
Milkhouse,
an
organic
dairy
located
in
Monmouth.
We
farm
around
250
acres
of
hay
and
pasture,
milk
about
40
Jersey
cows,
as
well
as
produce
beef
and
pork.
Our
farm
also
runs
a
state
licensed
creamery,
and
between
the
creamery
and
farm
operation
we
employ
up
to
10
people
during
the
peak
growing
season.
We
are
one
of
only
2
dairies
left
in
Monmouth,
a
town
that
not
too
long
ago
was
home
to
many
family
farms.
I’ve
been
involved
in
the
dairy
industry
in
Maine
for
over
a
decade,
and
now
serve
as
the
president
of
the
Maine
Organic
Milk
Producers.
I
have
never
experienced
the
anxiety
and
despair
that
is
felt
in
our
community
today.
The
dairy
industry
is
in
the
midst
of
an
ongoing
crisis,
including
the
organic
market,
and
without
intervention
I
fear
we
will
see
the
collapse
of
the
Maine
organic
dairy
sector.
While
the
long
term
fixes
lie
in
regulatory
changes
at
the
federal
level,
it
is
my
hope
that
you
all
will
support
issuing
emergency
funds
to
help
buy
our
industry
time.
As
many
of
you
already
know,
most
dairy
farms,
organic
and
conventional
alike,
ship
milk
into
commodity
markets
where
they
have
zero
control
over
the
price
they
are
paid
for
milk.
Don’t
like
the
price
you’re
getting?
That’s
too
bad
because
for
several
years
now
it
has
also
been
nearly
impossible
to
change
buyers
and
the
pool
has
shrunk
to
only
2
organic
buyers
for
all
of
Maine.
Organic
pay
prices
have
been
nearly
stagnant,
well
below
the
cost
of
production,
for
several
years,
while
prices
for
all
inputs
have
soared.
Organic
soybean
prices
have
nearly
doubled
sending
the
cost
of
organic
grain
rations
up
by
more
than
25%.
Electricity
rates
are
up,
at
our
farm
we
now
pay
over
$2,000/month
during
the
winter.
Diesel
has
nearly
doubled
in
price.
Local
labor,
if
you
can
find
it,
now
commands
over
$15/hour.
We
want
to
pay
our
workers
a
living
wage,
but
farm
owners
also
need
to
be
paid
fairly.
Soaring
interest
rates
are
making
financing
investments
and
upgrades
impossible.
Just
affording
basic
maintenance
has
become
a
problem
for
many
producers.
Many
have
stopped
buying
grain
altogether
because
they
can’t
afford
it,
which
negatively
affects
both
their
herd’s
health
and
milk
production
as
well
as
farm
income.
The

region’s
only
organic
feed
mill
has
liens
on
several
New
England
organic
dairies.
Several
Maine
organic
dairies
have
been
forced
out
of
business
in
the
last
two
years,
with
at
least
4
lost
in
2022
alone.
Without
emergency
relief,
more
will
go
under
in
2023.
There
is
great
value
in
the
existence
of
Maine’s
dairies
which
are
a
multibillion
dollar
industry.
They
provide
jobs,
a
product
our
state
can
be
proud
of,
and
they
command
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
of
farmland
which
make
up
an
important
land
base
for
food
production.
Dairies
are
anchors
in
our
agricultural
economy,
keeping
large
animal
veterinarians,
equipment
dealers,
and
feed
mills
operating.
They
contribute
to
the
beauty
of
our
state,
which
is
deeply
valued
by
both
longtime
residents
and
the
millions
of
annual
visitors
who
come
to
experience
the
bucolic
character
of
Maine.
Their
farmland
is
often
used
by
the
public
for
hunting,
hiking,
and
snowmobiling.
Nearly
every
dollar
that
goes
through
our
state’s
dairies
passes
directly
back
into
our
local
communities.
Maine
dairy
farms
need
sustained
support
during
this
current
crisis,
or
our
state
risks
losing
them
forever.
Sincerely,
Andrew
Smith
Caitlin
Frame
