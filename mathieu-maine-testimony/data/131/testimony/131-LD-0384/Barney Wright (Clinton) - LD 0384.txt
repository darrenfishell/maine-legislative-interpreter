Committee members. The challenges of Dairy production have come to more critical and in 
depth situations to remain in this business as post Covid has left its mark on Hopefully 
history.   Business models in every business has had to adjust as supply, labor (and all the 
extra challenges of that), and the qualities of either, and most notably the illusions of Markets 
and Market Demands.   Inflation and the results of that still is working through its details as 
everyone’s pockets have seen more friction in the past year. As dairy farmer markets have all
been sorted through in the past decade, co ops independent, organic and or on farm sale, the
prices set have worked around the federal order pricing structure as go to for setting a value 
for producers hence a forced budget to work from.     Keep in mind to get the best prices to 
grow crop’s commitments are made more than a year in advance. Meaning I had to consider 
and make a commitment to seed in sept of 2022 to plant and harvest in 2023 to feed cattle all
through 2024.  Much risk invested in inventory may be an impact to the bottom line year to 
year.  Just one example of many details of risk to plan for production to keep in line for the big
picture.
 As much has been done to come to protect a dairy producer in Maine, and it has, the current 
market climate has festered its own mutation of challenge and once again we come before 
the committee in leu of outdated federal market order systems that potentially drag a 
producer into the depths of disparity.
 I encourage everyone to consider led 384.
