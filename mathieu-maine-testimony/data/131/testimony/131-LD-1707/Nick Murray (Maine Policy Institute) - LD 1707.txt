to
Ensure
the
Right
to
Work
Without
Payment
of
Dues
or
Fees
to
a

Workers

Senator
Tipping,
Representative
Roeder,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Labor
and
Housing,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LD
1636
and
LD
1707
.
A
right-to-work
law,
which
prohibits
mandatory
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment,
has
the
potential
to
benefit
workers,
businesses,
and
the
overall
economy
of
Maine.
While
unions
have
historically
played
an
important
role
in
protecting
workers'
rights,
the
freedom
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
join
a
union
should
be
left
up
to
individual
employees.
To
date,
26
states
and
Guam
have
adopted
Right-to-Work
legislation.

Though
the
majority
of
southern
and
midwestern
states
have
embraced
the
policy,
no
state
north
of
West
Virginia
has
followed
suit.
With
Maine's
current
economic
struggles,
Right-to-Work
could
help
us
become
a
leader
in
the
region
and
revitalize
the
state's
economy.
First
and
foremost,
a
right-to-work
law
would
protect
workers'
individual
rights.
Employees
should
have
the
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
join
a
union,
without
fear
of
retribution
or
coercion.
By
allowing
workers
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
join
a
union,
a
right-to-work
law
promotes
individual
freedom
and
empowerment.
There
is
little
doubt
that
forced
unionization
has
a
detrimental
impact
on
Maine’s
economy.
A
2014
report
by
the
Competitive
Enterprise
Institute
found
that
“the
compelling
preponderance
of
evidence
suggests
there
is
a
substantial,
significant,
and
positive
relationship
between
economic
growth
in
a
state
and
the
presence
of
a
Right-to-Work
law.”

A
study
published
in
2013
by
the
Mackinac
Center
for
Public
Policy
found
that
from
1947
through
2011,
Right-to-Work
laws
increased
average
real
personal
income

states.

Unions
often
impose
rigid
work
rules
and
seniority-based
promotions
that
can
stifle
business
innovation
and
adaptation.
Under
Right-to-Work,
a
business
would
be
able
to
more
easily
experiment
with
new
work
arrangements
and
employee
incentives,
which
could
lead
to
better
wages
and
a
more
valuable
company.
Finally,
Right-to-Work
would
promote
much-needed
accountability
and
transparency
in
union
activities,
especially
those
serving
the
public
sector.
When
unions
are
able
to
rely
on
mandatory
membership
fees,
they
may
become
less
accountable
to
their
members
and
more
focused
on
political
activities
or
other
priorities.
By
allowing
workers
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
support
a
union
with
their
dues,
unions
would
be
forced
to
become
more
transparent
and
accountable
to
their
members.
If
public
workers
must
join
a
union
as
a
condition
of
employment,
no
union
may
compel
a
worker
to
fund
their
workplace
union,
per
the
United
States
Supreme
Court’s
2018
ruling
in
Janus
vs.
AFSCME.
Workers
must
decide
for
themselves
whether
to
financially
support
a
union.
Contrary
to
existing
state
statute,
public
employees
in
Maine
cannot
be
required
to
pay
dues,
fees,
or
any
other
form
of
payment
to
a
labor
organization
unless
the
employee
affirmatively
consents
to
pay.
This
committee
must
ensure
Maine
law
is
crystal
clear
on
this
point
by
passing
LD
1707.
Please
deem
LD
1636
and
LD
1707
“Ought
To
Pass”
to
protect
workers’
rights,
attract
new
businesses,
grow
Maine’s
economy,
and
increase
union
accountability
to
their
members.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
