Testimony of Senator Cameron Reny 
Introducing LD 1127, “Resolve, Directing the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife to Create a Process for Real-time Confirmation of Live Bait Retailer's 
Licenses by Electronic Means” 
Joint Standing Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
April I9, 2023 
Senator LaFountain, Representative Landry, and honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee 
On Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, l am Senator Cameron Reny, and l represent Senate District 13, 
which includes most of Lincoln County and the towns of Washington and Windsor. Today, I am 
presenting LD 1 127, “Resolve, Directing the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to Create 
a Process for Real-time Conﬁrmation of Live Bait Retailer's Licenses by Electronic Means.” 
This bill was brought to me by a constituent who has identiﬁed a speciﬁc concern with current 
licensing requirements for individuals who assist live bait harvesters and dealers. As an elected 
ofﬁcial, I believe it is important to support and give voice to the concerns and ideas of those I serve. 
While I may not be an expert on the subject matter, I am presenting this bill on his behalf to givea 
platform for further discussion. I have already been in contact with your analyst for help drafting an 
amendment to this bill that will better match the intent of my constituent. He is present today and 
prepared to provide additional information, context, and address any questions you may have. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Cameron Reny 
State Senator, District 13 
Representing Lincoln County and the towns of Washington and Windsor
