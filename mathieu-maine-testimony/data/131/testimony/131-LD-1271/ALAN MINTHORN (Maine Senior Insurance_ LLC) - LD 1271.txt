Committee Members: 
 
First thank you for your service to your constituents, our Maine residents. 
I am not in support of this language and believe it should be referred to the Maine Bureau of Insurance 
for further time and attention to provide complete protection for our residents.  
While LD 1271 is well intentioned, it does not create a mechanism if violations take place. Will there be 
a funded mechanism to collect, process, and enforce complaints in the final law? There are currently 
state and federal laws requiring similar language; but sadly, enforcement is rare, if at all, taking place.  
What constitutes "advertising?"  TV, telephone, social media, newsprint are not mentioned and far more 
widely abused than brochures and mailers, for example.  
Does "private person or entity" include licensed producers (agents) who already have marketing 
regulations to comply with from both Maine BOI and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services?  
Next, why just trigger three words "Medicare, Medicaid, and MaineCare?"  Many other forms of health, 
Final Expense, Long Term Care, home and/or auto extended warranties, and other insurances are 
frequently abused by telemarketing organizations. 
Lastly, there are no cited references to existing ME Bureau of Insurance, Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, or other State and 
Federal regulatory agencies â€“ all having laws addressing unsolicited contact, false advertising, or 
misleading the general public for financial gain.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
