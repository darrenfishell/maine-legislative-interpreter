SUPPORT — LD 603; An Act to Make Electric Breast Pumps More Accessible by Providing for 
MaineCare Reimbursement 
Good afternoon, Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and the members of the Health and 
Human Services Committee. My name is Mikenzie Dwyer, Public Health and Government 
Affairs Associate for the Maine Medical Association and I live in Windham. The MMA 
appreciates the opportunity to come before you today to submit the following comments in 
support of LD 603. This bill would expand access to electronic breast pumps and supply by 
ensuring reimbursement under MaineCare and reducing the administrative burden. 
Reducing administrative burden is one of the Maine Medical Associations priorities to increase 
overall access to quality, timely health care. Excessive physician workloads must be 
addressed by reducing time spent on administrative tasks, such as prior authorizations, and 
utilization review, keys drivers of physician burnout. Policies are needed that streamline and 
reform the way physicians must obtain health coverage approval before they can write 
prescriptions, order procedures, tests, or treatments. Administrative burdens dangerously 
delay needed care and directly contribute to physician and health worker burnout. 
Increasing access to electric breast pumps will help to encourage breastfeeding which has 
been shown to be the preferred food for a growing babies’ health. Compared to formula, the 
nutrients in breastmilk are better absorbed and used by the baby. Breastmilk has the nutrients 
that are best for the baby’s brain growth and nervous system development, as well as 
providing the baby with necessary antibodies to help fight infections and prevent chronic 
disease. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants are exclusively breastfed for 
approximately the first six months of life, after which complementary foods can be introduced, 
and to continue breastfeeding for one year or longer. For many advantaged mothers, this 
recommendation is easy to meet, but for groups with lower levels of income or education 
longer-term breastfeeding may be difficult. Low-income, first-time mothers generally breastfeed 
exclusively and, overall, for a shorter average duration than high-income, multiparous mothers. 
A potential barrier to breastfeeding success is access to a breast pump for home use. 
The Maine Medical Association is a statewide volunteer organization formed in 1853, serving more than 4,300 
current and future Maine physicians in all clinical specialties, organizations, and practice settings.
Additionally, the 2011 US Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding identified 
returning to work as an important barrier to breastfeeding for many women. Mothers who work 
full-time also have a shorter duration of breastfeeding than non-employed mothers. Electric- 
breast pumps enable mothers to provide breastmilk in advance and at their own time. 
The MMA urges the committee to vote ought to pass, as providing reimbursement for electric 
breast-pumps and lowering the administrative burden is an excellent step to supporting 
mothers to chose when and how to breastfeed their babies. 
Thank you for your consideration of this bill and hearing our comments. Please reach out with 
any questions. 
Sincerely, 
Mikenzie Dwyer
