Re: LD 603 — An Act to Make Electric Breast Pumps More Accessible by Providing for MaineCare 
Reimbursement' 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health 
and Human Services: 
This letter is to provide information with regard to LD 603, An Act to Make Electric Breast Pumps 
More Accessible by Providing for MaineCare Reimbursement. 
This bill requires the MaineCare program to reimburse for electric breast pumps and supplies without 
prior authorization or limitation when recommended or prescribed by a physician. The proposed bill 
also speciﬁes the reimbursement rate must be no less than the cost of the equipment. 
MaineCare already reimburses for electric breast pumps and supplies without prior authorization. 
Wholesale cost of electric breast pumps range from approximately $50-$300 per item; MaineCare ’s 
current reimbursement maximum is approximately $200 per item. MaineCare does not have concern 
about codifying coverage for breast pumps in statute. 
However, the Department opposes the section of the bill that changes current rate reimbursement 
methodology. Reimbursing at no less than cost offers no incentive for providers to ﬁnd cost effective 
equipment. Additionally, as this committee is aware, the rate reform process and principles established 
last year in P.L. 2021, Ch. 639, seek to ensure“ ... a rate-setting system for the development and 
maintenance of MaineCare payment models ... to be consistent with efﬁciency, economy, and quality 
of care; that are adequate to support MaineCare member access to services; and that are equitable and 
data-driven. ” The Department has a standard reimbursement methodology for all DME: it is not 
rational nor equitable to reimburse differently for speciﬁc DME codes and would undermine PL21, 
Ch. 639. 
We wanted you to be aware of the above information as you consider this bill going forward. Thank 
you for your consideration of this concern. 
Sincerely,

Michelle Probert, Director 
MaineCare Services
