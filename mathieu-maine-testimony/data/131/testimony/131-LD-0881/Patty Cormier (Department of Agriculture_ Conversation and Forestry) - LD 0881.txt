Dear Senator Rafferty and Representative Brennan, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs, 
I am writing on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) in 
support of LD 881, Resolve, Directing the University of Maine System to Study the Development 
of a Course Regarding the Use of Manufactured Wood Products.  
The Department values the robust forestry curriculum offered by the University of Maine’s 
School of Forest Resources.  In its own words, the School of Forest Resources takes “an 
integrated approach to the management of forests for desired, sustainable conditions that respond 
to society’s demands for a healthy forest environment, wood-based products (emphasis added), 
wildlife habitats, recreational opportunities, and water resources.” 
Contemplating the development of a course on the use of manufactured wood products strongly 
aligns with Maine’s Climate Action Plan Maine Won’t Wait, the State’s comprehensive approach 
to mitigating and adapting to climate change.  Strategy B of the Plan focuses on modernizing 
Maine’s buildings to create energy-efficient, smart, and cost-effective homes and businesses.  
Specifically: 
 
Strategy B.3 states, Advance the Design and Construction of New Buildings.  Enhance 
existing training on building codes and expand these programs to support ongoing 
education of contractors and code-enforcement officials.
 
Strategy B.4 states, Advance the Design and Promote Climate-Friendly Building 
Products.  Develop and enhance innovation support, incentives, building codes, and 
marketing programs to increase the use of efficient and climate-friendly Maine forest 
products, including mass timber and wood-fiber insulation.  
 
And Strategy B.5 states, “Lead by Example” in Publicly Funded Buildings.  Use 
procurement rules and coordinated planning efforts for state government to 
promote…climate-friendly construction materials…
Educating architects and engineers on the safety, beauty, durability, health benefits, and positive 
climate impacts of building with manufactured wood products is an important step to 
establishing an increased market demand for these climate-friendly products.  
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, 
Patty Cormier, Director, Maine Forest Service
