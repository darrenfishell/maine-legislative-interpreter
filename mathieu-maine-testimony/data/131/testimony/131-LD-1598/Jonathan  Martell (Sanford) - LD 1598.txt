LD 1598- An Act to Allow an Exception to Immunization Requirements for Health Care Workers for Vaccines 
Approved Under Emergency Use Authorization 
  
 
Memorandum of Support  
Date:  April 24, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Health and Human Services  
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE:  LD 1598- An Act to Allow an Exception to Immunization Requirements for Health Care Workers for 
Vaccines Approved Under Emergency Use Authorization 
 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Support of LD 1598- An Act to Allow an Exception to 
Immunization Requirements for Health Care Workers for Vaccines Approved Under Emergency Use 
Authorization 
 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell, and I'm from Sanford. 
 
As you may be aware, the COVID vaccine has been shown to not provide immunity to COVID or provide any 
significant benefit. Studies are also showing other negative side effects such as increased rates of myocarditis, 
and other uncommon conditions.  
 
Maine is in dire need of healthcare workers, and over 20% were illegally fired for refusal to take an experimental 
vaccine. Informed consent was not followed, which means workers should have had a choice.  
 
Please support this bill as we need exemptions in place.  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME
