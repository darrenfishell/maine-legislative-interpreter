At a time when we are all coming out of the cold winter months to enjoy the outdoors and mingle with 
friends, family and visitors to our beautiful state, why would some of our elected officials be promoting 
the idea that Maine is somehow immune to communicable diseases?  With 95% of the state’s population 
having received at least one dose of the COVID 19 vaccine, 82% fully vaccinated, and almost half of our 
population having received the booster, lawmakers would give the impression that we are out of the 
woods.  Because of the leadership of Nirav Shah and Anthony Fauci and the tireless work of our nation’s 
doctors, researchers, and healthcare workers, we were able to make intelligent decisions to mask up, 
isolate and vaccinate.  I believe these proposed bills currently under consideration will undermine the 
Maine’s stellar response to the pandemic and confuse the population into a false sense of security, that 
the COVID virus is no longer a threat.   
Specifically,  
 
• WHY would healthcare workers treating sick people be exempt from vaccines (LD 1598) ?  This bill 
seems to undermine the efforts of professionals who work diligently to explain the risks and benefits 
of a vaccine developed in an emerging crisis to a public begging for information.  This is muddy and 
appears to imply that healthcare workers are guinea pigs, and should be exempt from ‘unproven’ 
vaccines.  This would be confusing and frightening if nurses, doctors and other healthcare providers 
choose not to be vaccinated but dispense the very same vaccine to the general public.  
The threat remains.  VOTE NO.
