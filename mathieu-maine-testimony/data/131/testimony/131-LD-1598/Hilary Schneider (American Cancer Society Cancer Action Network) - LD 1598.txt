Senator Baldacci , Representative Meyer , and members of the Health and Human  Services Committee . My name 
is Hilary Schneider, and I am the Regional Government Relations Director of the North Atlantic  Region for the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN).  In this role, I serve as the lead Government 
Relations Director for Maine. ACS CAN, the nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer 
Society, supports evidence -based policy and legislative solutions designed to eliminate cancer as a major health 
problem. As the nation’s leading advocate for public policies that are helping to defeat cancer, ACS CAN ensures 
that cancer patients, survivors, and their families have a v oice in public policy matters at all levels of 
government.  
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to submit the following testimony  in opposition to LDs 59, 172, 
601, 1547, and 1598 .  
ACS CAN represents millions of patients and cancer survivors and  their families nationwide, including the more 
than 10,000 Mainersi who will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Many cancer patients and their families have 
been hard hit by the COVID -19 pandemic , which has placed cancer patients at substantial risk for severe illness. 
Cancer treatments – from chemotherapy to immunotherapy to bone marrow transplants – often weaken a 
patient’s immune system, making cancer patients especially vulnerable to communicable illnesses like COVID -19. 
A survey of cancer patients an d survivors in 2021  found that two -thirds of patients, and many caregivers, were 
worried about protecting their health from COVID -19.ii Those worries, combined with disruptions in health care 
services, led many cancer patients to delay or forego treatment.iii 
 
Fortunately, the availability of a COVID -19 vaccine helped protect many cancer patients  from the contracting the 
virus or from severe illness from COVID -19. The vaccine allowed many cancer patients to resume their normal 
treatments safely. Vaccines hav e been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID -19, 
even among people with cancer. In addition, there is evidence  that the  COVID -19 virus can persist in 
immunocompromised people, which may lead to the rise of new variants. Therefore, vaccinating these

lives.iv 
There is some evidence that cancer patients – or others with weakened immune systems – may not be fully 
protected even if they are vaccinated. A study from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society found that one in four 
blood cancer patients fail to produce detectable antibodies after COVID -19 vaccination.v  This makes it  even 
more critical that as many healthy people as possible are fully vaccinated in order to protect those who are 
unable to be vaccinated or for whom the vaccine may be less effective.   
 
The health and safety of people with cancer as well as our staff is  our top priority.   In order to  protect our  
constituents who are at high risk for the most serious outcomes from COVID -19, the American Cancer Society 
and ACS CAN require  vaccines for  all staff .  The American Cancer Society and ACS CAN also support mandatory 
COVID -19 vaccinations for all health care workers . Prohibitions  from vaccine requirements, like those in LDs 59, 
172, 601, 1547, and 1598  wou ld undermine the ability to protect our  constituents who are already facing a life -
threatening illness.   
 
For the above reasons, we urge you to vote “ought not to pass”  on LDs 59, 172, 601, 1547, and 1598 . We 
appreciate your time and consideration of our comments. I would be happy to answer any questions about this 
testimony.
