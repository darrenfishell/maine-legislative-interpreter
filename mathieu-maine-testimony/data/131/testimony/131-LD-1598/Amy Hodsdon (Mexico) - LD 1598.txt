I have a high school student who is getting her EMT certification at the age of 15 
knowing she cannot practice until she is 18.  Even though highly skilled in outdoor 
emergency care (OEC) she is unable to get her CNA certification due to the 
vaccination requirements. She will not be vaccinated and even though she will make 
an exceptional nurse one day, she will move out of state where she can practice 
without being forced to take vaccinations that are not necessary and strongly 
compromise her religious beliefs.
