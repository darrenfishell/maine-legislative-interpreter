LD 1598
Dear Members of the HHS Committee,  
I am writing in support of~ LD 1598: "An Act to Allow an Exception to 
Immunization Requirements for Health Care Workers for Vaccines Approved Under 
Emergency Use Authorization"
SUMMARY ~  This bill allows an exemption from immunization requirements for 
health care workers if the only available vaccine for a disease is one that is approved 
by the federal Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization 
and provides that an employer of health care workers may not require a vaccine 
approved under an emergency use authorization or retaliate against an employee for 
refusing to obtain a vaccine that is approved by the federal Food and Drug 
Administration under an emergency use
authorization.
I am pretty sure that you all, like myself, do not want things going into our bodies that
are unsafe and untested.  I am also pretty sure that you would not want folks to be 
retaliated against, and even lose their jobs, in a struggling economy, for refusing an 
untested product. 
 Isn't it high time to respect the Constitutional freedoms of the people of Maine.  See 
Articles, 1 and 3 of ME. Constitution and also the preambles, of both ME and U.S. 
Constitutions as.  
Please vote "ought to pass" for LD 1598
