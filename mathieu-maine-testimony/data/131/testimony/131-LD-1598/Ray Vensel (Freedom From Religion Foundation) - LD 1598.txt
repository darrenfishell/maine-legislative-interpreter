LD 1598 
 
Members of the Health and Human Services Committee, this is testimony AGAINST LD 1598.  
LD 1598 directly endangers the public health and makes more deaths from disease inevitable.  
Prohibiting employers from requiring emergency use vaccines, especially employers of health 
care workers, is a barrier to emergency responses to an immediate public health danger. This is 
contrary to accepted science and introduces an unnecessary barrier to emergency response.  
In the event of an emergency, the needs of public health demand that there be no barriers to 
emergency measures. Vaccines approved under emergency use help to prevent deaths.  
Please protect public health, and donâ€™t let this bill pass. Thank you.
