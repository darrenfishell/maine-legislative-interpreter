Dear
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury
and
Members
of
the
Criminal
Justice
&
Public
Safety
Committee:
My
name
is
Kelli
McCannell,
and
I
am
the
Executive
Director
with
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!),
an
education
and
advocacy
or ganization
led
by
grandmothers
and
elders
dedicated
to
advancing
reproductive
health,
rights
and
justice
for
present
and
future
generations.
GRR!
was
founded
in
Maine
in
2013
and
currently
engages
over
500
Maine
activists
in
our
work.
I’m
here
to
testify
on
behalf
of
GRR!
in
opposition
to
LD
761:
An
Act
to
Amend
the
Laws
Governing
the
Crime
of
Endangering
the
W elfare
of
a
Child
and
to
Create
the
Crime
of
Aggravated
Endangering
the
W elfare
of
a
Child
.
Our
or ganization
is
committed
to
ending
the
criminalization
of
pregnancy
and
all
of
its
outcomes,
as
well
as
uplifting
the
Reproductive
Justice
movement’ s
principles
of
providing
all
parents
with
the
power
and
r esour ces
to
raise
children
in
safe,
healthy
&
sustainable
environments.
It
is
from
this
values-based
framework
that
we
call
on
you
to
reject
LD
761.
W e,
like
all
of
you,
want
Maine
children
to
experience
safety .
Unfortunately ,
LD
761
seeks
to
add
punishment
to
tragic
situations,
rather
than
prevent
harm
in
the
first
place
or
provide
healing
resources
and
care
in
the
aftermath
of
the
serious
injury
or
death
of
a
child.
W e
believe
safety
for
children
fundamentally
requires
resourcing
and
supporting
parents,
especially
the
most
economically
and
socially
vulnerable
heads
of
households,
which
are
often
poor
mothers
and
poor
mothers
of
color .
GRR!
believes
compassionate
and
common
sense
policies
that
center
justice
for
vulnerable
communities
must
guide
the
steps
we
take
to
make
Maine
a
safe
place
for
all
children.
A
compassionate
and
common
sense
posture
toward
legislating
in
this
arena
would
assume
that
all
parents
and
guardians
want
to
do
their
best
for
the
children
in
their
care,
and
would
acknowledge
that
we
do
not
all
meet
the
numerous
challenges
of
child
rearing
with
the
same
economic
and
social
resources
at
our
disposal.
Poverty
is
one
of
the
greatest
threats
to
children’ s
safety
and
ability
to
thrive.
Poverty
can
make
leaving
domestic
violence
situations
intimidating
and
even
impossible
for
many ,
even
if
a
parent
recognizes
the
danger
themself
and
their
children
are
in
and
is
motivated
to
act.
Poverty
and
resulting
lack
of
access
to
healthcare
services,
including
mental
health
and
substance
use
treatment,
also
contribute
to
tragic
situations
wherein
children
of
loving
and
well-meaning
parents
are
harmed
or
die.

Poverty
and
other
forms
of
systemic
oppression
foster
a
culture
of
reckless
endangerment,
and
we
thus
ask
our
elected
representatives
to
take
up
the
numerous
public
policy
recommendations
put
forth
by
the
Permanent
Commission
on
the
Status
of
Racial,
Indigenous
and
T ribal
Populations,
especially
those
derived
from
the
report
created
out
of
LD
1 1 13.
Criminalizing
parents
following
the
brutal
loss
of
their
children
will
not
keep
any
of
us
safer .
It
will
not
bring
any
children
back
to
us.
Criminalization
is
not
accountability .
Instead,
we
as
a
collective
can
work
to
pass
policies
that
end
the
preventable
deaths
of
Maine
children
and
build
up
parents
who
struggle,
thereby
fostering
a
culture
of
justice
and
resilience.
W e
ur ge
you
to
vote
Ought
Not
T o
Pass
on
LD
761.
Sincerely ,
Kelli
McCannell,
Executive
Director
Grandmothers
for
Reproductive
Rights
(GRR!)
