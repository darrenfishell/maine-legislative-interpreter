“An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the Crime of Endangering the Welfare of a Child and to 
Create the Crime of Aggravated Endangering the Welfare of a Child” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Public Hearing Date: March 27, 2023 
Testimony in Support of LD 761 
Senator Beebe-Center, Representative Salisbury and members of the Committee on Criminal 
Justice and Public Safety. My name is Chelsea Lynds, and I am a prosecutor in Penobscot and 
Piscatiquis Counties. I am here to represent the Maine Prosecutors Association and the Office of 
the Attorney General and give testimony in support of LD 761. 
There is a disturbing statewide increase in the number of children who overdose on illicit drugs, 
like fentanyl, made accessible to the child by a parent or caregiver. In my own prosecutorial 
experience, these are very near-death experiences. A child who suffers a fentanyl overdose is 
unable to breathe on their own and requires breathing assistance to survive, including at times 
placement on a ventilator. The child also experiences a number of other symptoms, including 
lethargy/lifelessness, seizure behavior, vomiting and loss of consciousness. Survival is often the 
result of timely administration of Narcan. If an overdosing child does not receive Narcan on time 
and suffers a fatal overdose, then the person responsible for exposing that child to the overdose- 
inducing drug is potentially subject to manslaughter and even murder charges. 
Conversely, the statute that best ﬁts the scenario of an" infant or toddler surviving an overdose isa 
class D endangering the welfare of a child carrying a maximum penalty of 364 days in jail, a $2,000 
ﬁne, and no ability to impose probation. In other words, if child A overdoses on her mother’s 
fentanyl and is given a dose of Narcan in time to save her, then that mother is facing a misdemeanor 
endangering charge. If child B overdoses on her mother’s fentanyl, and she is given Narcan one 
minute too late and dies, then that mother is facing charges of manslaughter or murder. The 
position of the Maine Prosecutors Association is that the scenario envisioned above involving child 
A is serious enough to warrant a felony charge that is not currently reﬂected in Maine’s 
endangering the Welfare of a child statute, the statute that best captures the conduct at issue. 
For these reasons, the Maine Prosecutors Association supports LD 761.
