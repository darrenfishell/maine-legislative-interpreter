Dear
Senator
Beebe-Center ,
Representative
Salisbury
and
Members
of
the
Criminal
Justice
&
Public
Safety
Committee:
My
name
is
Cait
V aughan,
and
I
am
a
birthworker
who
focuses
on
accompanying
pregnant
and
parenting
Mainers
who
are
low
income,
have
significant
trauma
histories
and
substance
use
disorder ,
and
who
have
past
&/or
open
cases
with
the
Maine
Of fice
of
Child
and
Family
Services
(OCFS).
I’m
here
to
testify
in
opposition
to
LD
761:
An
Act
to
Amend
the
Laws
Governing
the
Crime
of
Endangering
the
W elfare
of
a
Child
and
to
Create
the
Crime
of
Aggravated
Endangering
the
W elfare
of
a
Child
.
As
a
doula,
I
provide
non-medical,
trauma-responsive
support
and
advocacy
for
such
clients
free
of
char ge,
because
I
view
it
as
a
practice
of
community
care
that
is
vital
to
our
collective
thriving.
It
is
also
a
personal
practice
of
healing
from
my
own
experiences
growing
up
in
an
abusive
home
as
the
eldest
of
five
children
raised
in
poverty
by
adults
with
substance
use
issues.
It
is
people
like
my
clients
who
I
fear
would
be
tar geted
by
this
bill.
One
of
the
greatest
threats
to
children’ s
safety
is
living
in
poverty .
Therefore,
one
of
the
greatest
investments
in
safety
we
can
make
is
resourcing
and
supporting
the
caregivers
who
strive
to
meet
their
needs
each
day .
Instead,
LD
761
heaps
punishment
on
parents
in
cases
of
tragedy ,
rather
than
preventing
harm
in
the
first
place.
This
is
a
wrongheaded
policy
response
that
punishes
individuals
for
systemic
problems.
Who
is
helped
by
legislation
like
this?
Perhaps
it
makes
the
general
public
feel
absolved
of
responsibility .
Perhaps
it
satisfies
a
base
human
desire
for
revenge.
But
it
does
not
achieve
compassion,
accountability ,
nor
solutions
to
the
very
real
problems
families
face.
As
a
birthworker ,
I
have
only
ever
encountered
parents
who
are
driven
to
have
the
healthiest
pregnancies
possible
and
care
for
their
children.
They
also
encounter
a
fair
amount
of
judgment,
discrimination
and
surveillance
compared
to
their
peers
with
economic
security
and
consistent
access
to
health
care.
I
focus
on
low-income
families
because
that
is
overwhelmingly
who
is
caught
up
in
child
welfare
systems.
This
disparity
reflects
systemic
biases,
and
our
solutions
ought
to
focus
on
undoing
these
systemic
barriers
and
creating
pathways
to
health
for
all.
Consciously
or
not,
this
bill
implies
there
is
a
subset
of
parents
who
are
not
punished
enough
by
the
serious
injury
or
death
of
their
own
children.
This
is
not
something
I
have
seen
any
evidence
of.
When
a
parent,
knowingly
or
accidentally ,
contributes
to
the
harm
of
their
child,
they
feel
deep
remorse
and
pain.
Most
people
are
flawed,
not
evil
or
heartless.
However ,
I
have
witnessed
mothers
blamed
by
the
state
for
not
leaving
violent
partners
even
when
they
had
no
safe
way
to
do
so.
I
have
witnessed
parents
trying
their
hardest
to
address
substance
use
and
finding
their
only
options
for
treatment
will
likely
mean
separation
from
the
very
children
who
drive
their
desire
to
recover .
Adding
steeper
sentences
to
Maine’ s
criminal
code
will
not
prevent
tragedy .
It
will
not
resurrect
dead
children.
W e
can
do
better
than
doubling
down
on
punishment.
The
young
people
of
this
state
deserve
better ,
as
do
their
parents,
who
are
struggling
to
meet
the
Herculean
challenges
of
childrearing
with
too
few
resources
at
hand.
I
ur ge
you
to
vote
Ought
Not
T o
Pass
on
LD
761.
Sincerely ,
Cait
