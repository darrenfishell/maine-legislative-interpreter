I am opposed to this bill as it would prevent modest application fees, which allow 
housing providers to limit their tenant screening to only those applicants who are 
seriously interested in the rental unit. This saves the provider significant time and 
money and will result in applicants getting timely responses to their application. IT 
also prohibits additional deposits for pets or other factors which encourage providers 
to accept "riskier" tenants. It interferes with the efficient operations of the housing 
market, which in the end hurts both providers and tenants.
