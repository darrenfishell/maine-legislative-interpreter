•My name is Bruce Blackmer from Dedham, Maine.
•I am on the Executive Committee of the Greater Bangor Apartment Owners and 
Managers Association, GBAOMA.

owners in, but not limited to, Waterville, Augusta, Portland, South Portland, 
Lewiston, Auburn, and the Bangor areas.
•I have been a landlord since 1972.  I have owned a 50-unit trailer park , 
multi-units, and single-family homes.  At one time, I managed 65 units.  I have mostly
provided affordable housing to low-income tenants.
