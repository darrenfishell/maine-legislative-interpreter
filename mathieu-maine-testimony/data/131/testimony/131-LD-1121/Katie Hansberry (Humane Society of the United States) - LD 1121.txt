An Act to Change Responsibility for Animal Control Officer Training  
to the Department of Public Safety  
Committ ee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry  
April 3 , 2023  
 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and honorable members of the Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry , my name is Katie Hansberry and I am the Maine State 
Director of The Humane Society of the United States.  
 
On behalf of HSUS and our Maine supporters, I want to tha nk you for the opportunity to testify today 
in support of LD 1121  and offer a  proposed ame ndment for your consideration , which is attached to 
my testimony  (new language highlighted in yellow and underlined) .  
 
As background , late in 2022 I participated in a meeting with representatives from the Maine Animal 
Control Association, Maine Federa tion of Humane Societies and Maine Municipal Association to 
discuss possible options for  improving animal control officer  training. The attached language  is what 
I drafted based on those discussions. Essentially, it seeks to maintain the existing animal co ntrol 
officer training offerings provided by the Animal Welfare Program  but add an optional advanced 
training to be provided through the Criminal Justice Academy . Due to the cost associated with 
attending training at the C riminal Justice Academy  it was included as an optional training making it 
mandatory would likely  be unfeasible for many municipaliti es.  
 
Maine is a leader in animal protection laws , but there is a need for improved enfo rcement  of strong  
laws. Th is committee recognized this last session  and took an essential  step by passing LD 1744 , 
which provided additional funding for the Animal Welfare Program. It is important that be followed 
up with providing additional res ources  and support,  such as training, for the animal control officers 
doing this  difficult and  life saving work.  
 
Thank you for your time and  consideration .
