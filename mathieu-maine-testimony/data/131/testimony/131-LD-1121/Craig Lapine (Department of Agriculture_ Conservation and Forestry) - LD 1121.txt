TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON 
AGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND FORESTRY 
OPPOSED TO LD 1121 
An Act to Change Responsibility for Animal Control Oﬂicer Training to the Department of 
Public Safety 
April 3, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, my name is Craig Lapine, and I am the Director of the 
Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. I am speaking on behalf of the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) in opposition to LD 1121, An Act to Change 
Responsibility for Animal Control Ofﬁcer Training to the Department of Public Safety. 
DACF is charged with developing, implementing, and administering a comprehensive program 
that upholds the State’s animal welfare laws. As part of that mandate, our Animal Welfare 
Program (AWP) implements training and certiﬁcation requirements for municipal animal control 
officers (ACOs). Historically, Maine’s geography and the funding model for AWP have 
presented challenges to providing robust in-person training. Nevertheless, prior to the pandemic, 
AWP offered a mix of in-person and online training. Post-pandemic, all our offerings have 
remained online, though at least one in-person training —a day-long equine-focused advanced 
training —is planned for late summer or early fall 2023. 
The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC) is made up of animal welfare advocates and 
experts and is charged by law with reviewing and making recommendations on training 
programs for ACOs and AWP’s district humane agents. AWP is currently working with AWAC 
to update the criteria for qualifying training to fulﬁll continuing education credit 
requirements. These trainings will be delivered with a mix of in-person and online options, and 
We expect to have this retooled structure in place by the end of summer. 
In the world of animal welfare, it is best practice to lead with education and assistance and use 
enforcement tools as a last resort. This is the approach demonstrated to create the best outcomes 
for both animals and humans. Moving ACO training to the Department of Public Safety, which 
has neither our animal welfare mandates, nor our institutional knowledge, nor the oversight of 
AWAC, is not advisable.
