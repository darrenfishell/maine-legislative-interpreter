LD 1121: An Act to Change Responsibility for Animal Control Officer Training to the Department of 
Public Safety 
April 3, 2023 
Senator Ingwersen, Representative Pluecker, and Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, my name is Matt Harrington, and I am the State Senator 
from Sanford representing the people of Senate District 33. I am here to introduce LD 1121, “An Act 
to Change Responsibility for Animal Control Officer Training to the Department of Public Safety.” 
This bill requires the Commissioner of Public Safety develop programs to train animal control 
ofﬁcers and to certify all animal control officers who successfully complete the training programs. 
Currently, these responsibilities belong to the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry. 
I submitted this legislation after hearing from a colleague who represents the Maine Animal Control 
Association. The Maine Animal Control Association strives to protect the wellbeing of all animals, 
domestic or wild - a worthy undertaking. When professionals who work in the ﬁeld come to me with 
an idea, I am pleased to bring it forward. After all, it is they who have the knowledge and know 
where the problems are. 
Therefore, I will defer to my colleague today, and ask that you listen intently to her testimony. 
Thank you.
