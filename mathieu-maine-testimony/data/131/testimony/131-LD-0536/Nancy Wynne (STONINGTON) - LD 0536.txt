I’ve long been concerned that disposal of my body would add more trauma to this 
lovely planet, this planet that has supplied me so generously will all my needs.  I want
to nourish it.   
Cremation is responsible for carbon dioxide, and creates sterile ash, too alkaline and 
high in sodium to be used on plants.    I don’t want to  take up space in a cemetery, or 
be buried in a casket within a cement vault or plastic liner, all of which I see as 
assaults on the earth.  
This dear Earth.   I love her.   I want to nurture her as she has so well tended to me.  I 
save every scrap from my kitchen, every plant I need prune, to make compost.   This 
is such visible shapeshifting.   My leftovers  become the next generation of healthy 
beets or lovely lilies in my garden.   I so want the same for my body.   
We witness the everyday miracle of compost.   The tiny dead mouse nourishes the soil 
nematodes that nourish the tree that produces the peach that nourishes my body.   A 
beautiful process.   I want to continue to be part of that cycle.   We are shapeshifters, it’s so 
obvious.  To interrupt that great natural plan is misguided.   I want my body to transform to 
flower, fungus or bear.
