LD 536
Dear Members of the Maine Legislature,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic support for LD 536, "An Act to Provide 
Natural Organic Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for the Conversion of 
Human Remains to Soil."
Return Home is dedicated to providing an environmentally sustainable option for the 
disposition of human remains, and we believe that natural organic reduction is the 
most ethical and responsible way to do so. Our facility uses a carefully controlled 
process that, with very low inputs, transforms human remains into life-giving soil.
One of the key benefits of natural organic reduction is its positive impact on the 
environment. Traditional burial and cremation methods can be incredibly 
resource-intensive and produce large amounts of waste and emissions. NOR not only 
reduces the amount of waste generated by end-of-life practices, but also provides 
valuable nutrients to return to our soil. By supporting natural organic reduction 
facilities, Maine can take a significant step towards a more sustainable and 
environmentally responsible approach to end-of-life practices.
If LD 536 is passed, it will provide an important regulatory framework for natural 
organic reduction facilities in Maine. This will ensure that facilities like ours are held 
to the highest standards of safety, hygiene, and ethical practice. We welcome this 
oversight and believe that it will help to build trust with our clients and the wider 
community.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Brienna Smith
Chief Operating Officer, Return Home
