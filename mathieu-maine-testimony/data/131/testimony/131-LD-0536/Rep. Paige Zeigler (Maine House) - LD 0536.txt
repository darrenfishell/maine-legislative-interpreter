 Testimony of Representative S.Paige Zeigler before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and 
Human Services, in support of LD 536 An Act to Provide Natural Organic Reduction Facilities 
for MaineResidents for the Conversion of Human Remains to Soil 
Good morning, Senator Baldacci and Representative Meyer, and distinguished members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services,. My name is Paige Zeigler, and I represent District 
40 consisting of the towns of Appleton, Islesboro, Liberty, Lincolnville, Montville, Morrill,  and 
Searsmont. I am writing to support LD 536 An Act to Provide Natural Organic Reduction Facilities 
for Maine Residents for the Conversion of Human Remains to Soil 
I simply want to say that as long as I don’t affect public health in a negative manner, ask the State 
to subsidize the disposal of my body or affect any other’s financial well being then I feel the State 
should not decide how I wish to dispose of my body.
