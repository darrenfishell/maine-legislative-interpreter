LD 536
Esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services, 
my name is Deirdre Sulka/Meister I live in Portland Maine.
I’m urging you to vote “Ought to Pass” on LD 536 An Act to Provide Natural 
Organic Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for the Conversion of Human 
Remains to Soil.
I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013 at the age of 42. I am luck and grateful 
to still be alive 10 years later. I didn’t think it would be possible when I was 
diagnosed with cancer but I have seen my child graduate from high school AND 
collage and blossom into a wonderful young adult.  I have shifting list of things I’d 
like to do while I’m still here. Some things on the bucket list  i’ve given up on - I 
don’t think I will ever get that black belt in Aikido and I likely won’t live to see 
grandchildren.  Some things I’ve done - I built a stone wall and am learning to paint,  
And there is one thing on my bucket list that I would like for after I die. To return to 
the earth in the most ecological way possible.  
Living with a terminal illness I have researched the the options available.  Natural 
organic reduction seems like the best option for me from both an environmental and 
spiritual  perspective.   I have seen NOR become legal in other states and hope that i 
live long enough that I can die knowing that my body no longer needed, can be 
transformed into nourishment - feeding the web of life on this planet that has 
sustained me.
Thank you.
