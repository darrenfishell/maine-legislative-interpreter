Dear Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and other members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services: 
I am submitting written testimony on behalf of the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Maine,a 
nonprofit organization founded in 1973. For 50 years FCA Maine has been advocating for 
funeral choice for consumers in Maine. FCA Maine is dedicated to providing education and 
advocacy for the public so they may be informed of the options available for pre-planning the, 
disposition of their remains in a dignified, affordable manner. ,» 
The Funeral Consumer Alliance of Maine supports L.D.536 An Act to Provide Natural Organic 
Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for the Conversion of Human Remains to Soil. 
This bill offers another choice for consumers as they arrange funeral services. We know from 
comments we receive from our members and the public that Mainers are interested in this 
option. |\/lore choices for Maine consumers help the public get the funeral they want at a price 
they can afford. The choice may not be for everyone, but it should be an available option. 
On behalf of our membership, FCA Maine urges you to vote "Ought to Pass" on this bill. 
Thank you for your consideration of our comments.-
Sincerely, 6
