 Testimony of Senator Stacy Brenner in Support of LD 536, “An Act to Provide Natural Organic 
Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for the Conversion of Human Remains in Soil” 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services 
April 4, 2023 
 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and Distinguished Colleagues on the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Stacy Brenner. I represent Senate District 
30, which includes all of Gorham and most of Scarborough. I’m testifying in favor of LD 536, “An 
Act to Provide Natural Organic Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for the Conversion of 
Human Remains in Soil.” 
 
This legislation would allow Mainers to have an alternate choice in how they wish to be buried after 
death. Cremation uses large amounts of fossil fuels that negatively impacts the environment, while 
natural organic reduction only accelerates the decomposition process that happens naturally. This 
process uses one eighth of the energy  required for cremation, saving over one metric ton of CO2. 
Decomposition creates temperatures over 131 degrees Fahrenheit  that kills harmful bacteria, viruses 
and other pathogens, while also stabilizing heavy metals. As a result, the final product is safe to use 
on gardens and trees, providing a natural, and oftentimes comforting way for someone to return to 
the natural elements at the end of their life.  
 
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions.
