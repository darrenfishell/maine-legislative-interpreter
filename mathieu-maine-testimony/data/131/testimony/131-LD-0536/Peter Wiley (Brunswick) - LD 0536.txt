Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Committee on Health and Human 
Services, my name is Peter Wiley, and I've been a resident of Brunswick for the last 15 years. I am here 
in support of LD 536, An Act to Provide Natural Organic Reduction Facilities for Maine Residents for 
the Conversion of Human Remains to Soil, and I urge you to vote "Ought to Pass" on this legislation. 
I had not heard of natural organic reduction until a few months ago, so you're not alone if this seems 
like a new concept. Ifirst heard about it in a newspaper article I read in December. It's really a pretty 
simple concept that is more in line with what humans have done with bodies for thousands of years, 
excluding the last 150 years or so. As the father of three school-aged children, I try to do what I can to 
minimize the impact I have on the environment and believe that collectively, we can act to turn the tide 
on climate change to leave our children and grandchildren with a brighter future. Natural organic 
reduction would be a pretty easy way to reduce carbon emissions. When my wife and I started a family, 
I made up a will and I had noted that I want to be cremated, thinking this was an environmentally 
friendly option—it’s actually not, I've learned recently, at least compared to natural organic reduction. 
Natural organic reduction emits just one-eighth to one-tenthl of the carbon dioxide emitted by 
cremation. Cremation is now the most popular option in the US for putting the dead to rest (with 
cremation accounting for nearly 60%2 of those who die), and lvlaine actually ranks second in the country 
in terms of cremation, with 8O%2 of those who die being cremated. Natural organic reduction would just 
be another consumer choice for folks, and that's all we're asking for here—that it be a choice. I want the 
freedom to decide what happens to my body, and that's what this legislation will support. 
This legislation would also support a potential economic opportunity for Maine for companies that have 
already figured out efficient technology for natural organic reduction. Why not welcome more business 
development in our state? NOR would all take place within a licensed, regulated industry —this isn't 
something anyone can just do in their backyard, and this legislation offers assurance that only 
professionals will handle NOR. 
Also, Maine wouldn't be the first state to make natural organic reduction legal. In fact, six other states 
have already gone before us. As you know well, many Mainers would surely welcome this eco-friendly 
option, wanting to be buried in a way that minimizes environmental impact. 
Finally, on a spiritual level, there's some appealing to me about being folded back into the organic life 
cycle. Maybe that sounds weird and some may say this isn't a "dignified" option, but for me, the idea of 
returning my body to nature is perhaps the most dignified option with respect to this planet. I know 
there are folks who might oppose this bill on religious grounds, but as a Christian, I find comfort in the 
Bible's repeated reminders that we're all just made of this earth, like this one from Genesis 3:19, ”By the 
sweat of your brow, you will eat your bread until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; 
for dust you are and to dust you will return." NOR is very much in line with a Christian view on what 
should happen to our bodies when we die. 
Again, please pass this legislation, and thank you for listening to me today.
