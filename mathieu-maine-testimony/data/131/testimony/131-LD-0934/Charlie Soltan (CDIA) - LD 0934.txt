TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION OF 
L.D. 934 - AN ACT TO AMEND THE LAWS GOVERNING DAMAGES AWARDED 
FOR WRONGFUL DEATH 
. BY 
THE MAINE ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES
& 
MEDICAL MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF MAINE 
, APRIL 6, 2023 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Committee 
on Judiciaiy, my name is Charlie Soltan, a resident of Winthrop, and appear here today 
on behalf of the Maine Association of Insurance Companies (MAIC) and Medical Mutual 
Insurance Company of Maine (Medical Mutual) in opposition to LD 934. 
The members of the MAIC are Maine based property and casualty companies 
writing nearly all lines of personal and commercial insurance, including auto, 
homeowners, commercial risk, workers’ compensation and medical professional liability 
insurance. We employ hundreds of Maine residents in well-paying professional and 
challenging jobs. Our collective mission is to sen/e our customers ’ interests after they 
have purchased our products to protect their homes, families, employees, businesses 
and financial interests from unexpected loss. Medical Mutual Insurance Company of 
Maine provides the vast majority of professional liability coverage for Maine’s medical 
professionals and hospitals. 
The MAIC and Medical Mutual respectfully urge the committee to reject the 
significant and costly expansions proposed in LD 934. The expansion proposed by 
LD 934 impacts virtually every Mainer personally and every Maine business. 
Coverage for wrongful death is provided in all policies that include liability coverage, 
personal auto and home policies, commercial auto policies, professional and medical 
liability policies, business owner’s policies, recreational vehicle policies, commercial 
general liability, and many others. 
Even with insurance available, most Mainers, whether for personal or business 
protection, do not carry policy limits to cover these proposed caps. Many medical 
professionals and their employers, for example, currently tend to have professional

increased costs onto all of us. 
The following illustrates what kind of auto insurance protections Mainers currently 
have. For 1 member insurer, 1% of its insureds carn,/ 50/100 limits, 39% 100/300, 18% 
250/500+ . Another 1% carry 100 CSL (Combined Single limits2), 15% 300 CSL, and 
27% 500+ CSL. Less than 10% of these insureds carry an umbrella policy, with most of 
those at $1 million. 
Another carrier by illustration, has 4% at minimum limits, 27% at 100/300, 14% at 
250/500, and 1‘/2% at 500/500. 13% carry 300 CSL and another 34% carry $500 CSL. 
Of their insured, only 15% carry an umbrella. These 2 examples are representative of 
the level of coverage Mainers purchase. 
What this shows is that an incredibly small number of Mainers carry insurance 
that cover today's current caps for wrongful death, and even fewer could cover the new 
proposed caps. 
The proponents of this legislation may argue that people can secure umbrella 
policies. But umbrella coverage is not available to all applicants as this line is heavily 
reinsured and unden/vriting guidelines imposed by the reinsurers are stricter than for 
primary coverage. ln other words, most Mainers will have no means to financially 
protect themselves through insurance against a wrongful death claim. 
One other point using auto insurance as an example. The State requires all of us 
to carry auto insurance, at least of a minimal level in order to protect others. Why then 
are we considering putting every resident at additional risk by raising the wrongful death 
caps even further? This legislation is increasing the odds that more people's lives will 
be economically destroyed. 
Finally, note section 4 of the wrongful death statute, footnoted above. In that 
section, the Legislature has seen fit to not make the limits of wrongful death apply 
to itself and its employees, as well as all other governmental agencies? ’ We

wonder what makes the State so special to carve itself and its employees out of the 
wrongful death caps. You may respond that it’s just taxpayer money. Well what 
taxpayer is not already a Maine resident that must buy auto insurance, which they 
purchase to protect their personal or business financial wellbeing? 
We urge you to reject LD 943 and leave the wrongful death statute as is. 
4. Apportionment of claims. When the amount awarded to or settled for multiple claimants 
exceeds the limit imposed by this section, any party may apply to the Superior Court for the 
county in which the governmental entity is located to allocate to each claimant his equitable 
share of the total, limited as required by this section. 
A. Any award by the court in excess of the maximum liability limit specified by subsection 1 shall 
be automatically abated by operation of this section to the maximum limit of liability. [PL 1977, c.
