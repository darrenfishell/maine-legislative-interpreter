Making matters worse, we contend that the higherjudgements as a result of the higher 
damage amounts that are being proposed here are likely to rest on industries like ours since 
our “deep pockets” can be on the hook for the entire judgement amount even if our members 
are only 1% responsible due to Maine’s joint and several liability laws. 
ln conclusion, and as cynical as it sounds, we see this as being just as much about 
increasing settlement values as it is about providing greater justice for victims of tragic 
circumstances. A less objectionable approach would be to require any additional increase in 
damages to go directly to the victims and not to line the pockets of personal injury attorneys. 
Obviously, this is not something that can be legislated, but if the arguments for LD 934 is to 
provide additional monetary award for those impacted by the death of a loved one, then make 
sure they are the sole beneficiaries of the additional damage amounts. 
Thank you for your consideration and for allowing me to testify. I would be happy to answer 
any questions the committee has now or at the Work Session.
