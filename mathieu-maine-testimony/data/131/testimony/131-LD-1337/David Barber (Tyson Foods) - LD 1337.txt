Testimony before the 
Taxation Committee 
in Opposition of 
LD l 337, An Act to Require a Corporation that Files a Tax Return in the State to Filea 
Tax Disclosure Statement 
April |3,2023 
Good afternoon, Senator Grohoski, Rep. Perry and Members of the joint Standing Committee on 
Taxation. Thank you for this opportunity to testify in opposition of LD I337. My name is David Barber, 
Former President and CEO of Barber Foods which is now part of Tyson Foods. As a niche product 
producer as part of a much larger corporate parent, Barber Foodsâ€™ stuffed chicken prepared in Portland 
are the only products like it produced in the Tyson network. With only three significant national 
competitors, the disclosures proposed are deeply concerning. These disclosures could give critical 
competitive information on cost of goods, significant capital expenditures, research and development 
spending, revenue and other proprietary along with tax information. Now that we are part of a much 
larger public company, this sensitive information could be very damaging to our competitive position. 
Tyson Foods strongly opposes LD 1337 and what it tries to accomplish. We hope the committee listens 
to the business community and respects the privacy of company information. 
Thank you for considering our point of view.
