 TESTIMONY OF 
MICHAEL J. ALLEN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER FOR TAX POLICY 
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation 
Hearing Date: April 13, 2023 
  
LD #1337 – “An Act to Require a Corporation That Files a Tax Return in the State 
to File a Tax Disclosure Statement” 
 
 
 Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation 
Committee – good afternoon, my name is Michael Allen, Associate Commissioner 
for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.  I am 
providing testimony at the request of the Administration Neither For Nor Against 
LD 1337, “An Act to Require a Corporation That Files a Tax Return in the State to 
File a Tax Disclosure Statement.” 
 Corporate tax transparency bills, such as this one, have recently been in the 
national tax policy discussion.  Arguments in favor of such bills often include the 
idea that some corporations are somehow avoiding the tax that they “should” pay 
or that legislators and public policy analysts need additional information to 
formulate good tax policy proposals.  While there may be some truth to those 
arguments in certain situations, the bill before you now is unnecessarily complex 
and over-broad, raising compliance, administrative, and technical issues.  
Moreover, consideration of the possible benefits of increased corporate tax 
transparency should be balanced with the longstanding importance of 
confidentiality in the tax system and non-confidential information sources should 
be explored.

  We understand that Representative Matlack plans to put forward an 
amendment that would significantly simplify the bill and look forward to 
reviewing that amendment when it is available.  
The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on the 
bill; Representatives from MRS will be here for the Work Session to provide 
additional information and respond in detail to the Committee’s questions.
