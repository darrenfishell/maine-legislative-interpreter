Thank you for your time and I just want to say I envy your voice here today. You all 
have the power of life in your tongue. I just want to say I was a 6 month old 
Premature Twin baby in 1986 and I want to say I am still Alive, Speaking, and 
Voting. I\/Iy life matters. I am against LD 1619. In 1986 the medical Technologies 
and Medical practices were not where we are today and We can save lives. So let's 
save lives today and Vote Ought not to pass on LD 1619 or any of the other 
Extreme bills on abortion.
