Senator Carney, Represenative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Vicki Dearbom and I live in Glenburn. 
I am here to testify in opposition to LD1619. 
I know that the current law already covers medical necessity, so I am perplexed 
as to Why we need to expand the law to aborting a baby that can live outside the Womb. 
This is obviously no longer about the life of the mother. 
My husband and I have 8 grandchildren of which two are adopted. This, by the way, 
is a great option for ALL involved. These two children are a blessing to our entire 
family. We are very thankful to these parents that chose life even though they 
recognized their own inability to raise them. 
I would like to leave you with this: 
For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for 
evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11 
So I ask you, other than God, if our children are not our future and our hope, what is? 
I implore you to vote “ought not to pass” on LD 1619. 
Thank you
