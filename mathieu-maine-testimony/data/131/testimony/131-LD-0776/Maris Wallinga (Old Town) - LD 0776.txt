My name is Maris Wallinga from Old Town, l’m here to represent the 
depopulating youth here in Maine._ 
This bill is barbaric and extreme, it has been made clear tonight that the 
people don’t want this bill. 
Immense tragedies happened to the African Americans and Jews because 
they were looked at as less than human. Nationality and the color of one’s 
skin not making them a human is just as absurd as what side of the birth 
canal they are on. Please be on the right side of history today.
