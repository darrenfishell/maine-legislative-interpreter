Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Kathleen Knight and I am a resident of Belfast. 
I am here to speak in opposition to LD1619 because I believe that we are all created 
in the image and likeness of God, and that life is sacred. 
In the Book of Jeremiah 1:5 God spoke to him saying, “ Before I formed you in the 
womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you, a prophet to the nations I 
appointed you.”_ 
I believe that each human being has a purpose, some very magnificent in the eyes of 
men; others not so obvious, one purpose as important as the other however, “for man 
does not see as God sees." 
The thought of allowing an innocent child to be killed in his or her mother's womb is 
abhorrent to me. Please, please, please search deeply into your conscience when you 
vote on this bill. Know that you are literally voting on life or death for countless numbers 
of children. Not only is the loss of a child devastating, many studies have shown that 
the effect on the mother is also devastating and long lasting. 
We who are here today are fortunate to live in a country whose founding fathers had 
the wisdom to recognize that "We are all endowed with the unalienable rights of LIFE, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Please vote to maintain these rights for everyone 
deserving of them and yet unable to speak for themselves. Please defeat LD1619. 
Thank you.
