My Public Comments on LD1619 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Michael Whitney, and l am a resident of Bath. l am 
here to testify in opposition to LD1619. 
l am here today to strongly urge you to vote “ought not to pass” on LD1619. 
in Exodus 20:13 God says “Do not commit murder.” But if that is not enough for some, 
let's follow the science. 
The baby in the womb feels pain after 24 weeks gestation. To perform an abortion at 
this stage, 24 weeks and beyond, inflicts an agony on this child that we would consider 
reprehensible were it done to a litter of puppies. Please do not let this happen! 
At this stage in the pregnancy there are only two ways to eliminate this baby 1) To take 
him or her apart in the womb, bring out the pieces and count them to make sure the 
whole body has been removed, or 2) Bring the whole child out alive and kill it. 
No one has the right to do this to another human being! No one! This is not the 
"woman's body”! The baby is a separate little human with their own DNA, fingerprints, 
and if given the chance, their own personality, as any parent here can tell you. 
Please vote “ought not to pass” on LD1619! Surely this Committee has more 
compassion than to do this to another human being! 
Respectfully, 
Mike Whitney
