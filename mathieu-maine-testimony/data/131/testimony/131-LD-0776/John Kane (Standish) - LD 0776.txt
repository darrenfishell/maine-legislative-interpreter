Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary, my name is .lohn Kane, and l am a resident of Standish. l arn here to testify in opposition 
to LD 1619." 
I was bom in March of 1950 in Norwich Connecticut, USA. I am the number 2 in a family of 6 children. 
My mother and Father struggled to make ends meet. in 1965 I was 15 years oid when my mother 
conceived my youngest sister, Frances. Mom was very distraught because she did not know how she 
and Dad would provide for another mouth to feed. Consequently, she tried to abort by taking the 
abortion pill. it didn't work and Frances Louise Kane was born November 19, 1966. Mom told me she 
was so grateful that the abortion did not happen as Frances was a blessing beyond measure. 
Everyday thousands of blessings are missed due to abortions and the world is all the poorer because 
of it. l stand against LD 1619 because people are the world's greatest assets, not the world's greatest 
hinderance.
