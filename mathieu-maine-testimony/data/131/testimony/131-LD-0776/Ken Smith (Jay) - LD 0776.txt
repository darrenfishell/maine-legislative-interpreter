Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and distinguished 
members of the Judiciary Committee. 
My name is Ken Smith. I'm a resident oflay Maine. 
I am a devout Catholic and I come to oppose LD1619. 
I can't believe that I am standing here today in front of you 
having to defend the life of a full-term human baby. 
What Have We Become as people of this Civilized Nation. 
thou shall not kill is the commandment of our God, it isn'ta 
suggestion. 
Only if it meets our greedy self-centered excuses. 
We pride ourselves for being so advanced with all the 
technology, gadgets and the permissive lifestyle. 
But if you pass a law that permits the killing of an infant, we are 
still criminals and only barbarians destined to be lost.
