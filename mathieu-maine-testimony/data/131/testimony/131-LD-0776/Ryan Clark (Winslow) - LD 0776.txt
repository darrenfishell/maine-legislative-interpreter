My name is Ryan Clark from Winslow Maine. l have lived in Maine all my life & have lived all 
over the State from Aroostook Country to the Portland area & Central Maine. l thing that is unique 
about the People of Maine is how independent & Moderate we are. Just look at our 2 U.S. Senators. l 
Independent & 1 Very Moderate Republican. 
We Mainers don't put up with Extreme Policies on the Left or the Right. I don't believe you will 
ﬁnd many Mainers who want to make Abortion 100% Illegal in all circumstances & even outlaw birth 
control. I also highly doubt you will ﬁnd many Mainers who Would be in favor of Abortion up to the 
moment or birth. That is Wicked extreme & it is just plain Wicked. 
You might try to make the argument that in this law a Dr. has to say it is necessary but no one 
is this room is Stupid enough to believe that anyone who wants an Abortion for any reason up to full 
term will have any trouble ﬁnding a Dr. who will say it's necessary. Planned Parenthood will quickly 
put together a list of Abortion friendly Doctors who will sign off on Anything. I can't imagine the 
Maine legislature is Extreme enough to pass this bill. Many countries in Europe limit Abortion to 12 or 
14 weeks. We are not a State of Extremists so please don't pass this Extremely Radical Bill. 
The Left & Right in this Country is like a Dysfunctional Marriage. Somewhere along the past 
the stopped listening to each other. The Right went too far in the Iraq war. The left goes too far in this 
bill. I beg you to listen to people you may not like very much. Don't destroy your Heart and Soul by 
voting for this bill.
