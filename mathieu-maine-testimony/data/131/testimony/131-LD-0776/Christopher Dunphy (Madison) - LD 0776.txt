RE: LD1619 
To \/Vhom it May Concern: 
This is a dangerous and unnecessary bill that is being brought to legislature. I would even dare say an 
escalation of a destructive pattern. lt is hard for me to fathom that this bill is even being brought up. It 
feels so evil to even think of. Morality doesn't even equate with the thought of terminating a viable 
newborn baby, It is shameful to think that our women are being told these lies to begin with. Life is 
precious, mothers are so important. We must stand in united to protect the pregnant women. I would 
rather see more funding for unwed mothers caring for a new life then funding for them to kill their viable 
baby and suffer the mental health consequences that surely follow committing such a heinous crime. This 
bill would allow for the termination of a viable baby up to the date of delivery. How is this not being 
spoken as the killing of an innocent life. We must come together and protect the innocent life of the 
unborn. We must stand together and protect the pregnant mother.
