Subject: Testimony for LD 1619 
This messac originates from outside the Maine Le islature. 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Committee on Judiciary, l am writing to express my 
opposition to L.D. 1619, An Act to improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws. l saw on the news that Governor Mills 
has put forward this bill to allow abortion up until the point of birth. ln addition, it is my understanding that the bill takes 
away the crime of an unlicensed individual performing an abortion. 
ls there anything we citizens can do to stop this expansive bill from opening our state up to huge liabilities? Can I count 
on you lawmakers to vote against this bill? 
l believe an amendment should be included to find a way to encourage adoption as an alternative to abortion. 
Please oppose L.D. 1619. 
Thank you for your help. 
Sincerely, 
Wanda O'Brien
