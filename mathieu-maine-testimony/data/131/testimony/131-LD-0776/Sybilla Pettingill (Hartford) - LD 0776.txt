Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Sybilla Pettingill, and l’m a resident of Hartford. l’m here to testify in opposition to 
LD 1619. 
It doesn't seem like killing babies is a good solution for anything. Mothers can still choose how 
to deal with their unwanted pregnancy. There are a few options, but killing a human being 
shouldn't be one of them. Killing a human being is against the law.‘ 
Please vote ought not to pass.
