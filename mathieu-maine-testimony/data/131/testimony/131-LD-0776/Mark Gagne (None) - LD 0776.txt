I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for all life. When I was nineteen-years-old, I madea 
series of bad choices. Unprotected sex, drugs, alcohol, partying, making all the wrong choices. Me anda 
girlfriend had unprotected sex and she ended up getting pregnant . Reality hit us both. Without praying or 
seeking advice, we searched for a place to have an abortion. It was not hard to find. Being young and not 
thinking anything through, I made the biggest mistake of my life by agreeing to have her get an abortion. 
I remember we both looked at each other and just knew we made a horrible decision. Years later, having 
found my true identity in Christ and having 2 amazing kids, I realize how amazing and important life in 
general is. I ask that you just look at your children, nieces, nephews, friendsâ€™ kids, and babies, and see 
how beautiful God's creation is. I pray we love one another. God bless you all. Please vote ought not 
pass.
