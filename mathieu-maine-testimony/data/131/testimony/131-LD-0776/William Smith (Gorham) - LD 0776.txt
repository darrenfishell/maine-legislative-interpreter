Testimony in review of LD 776: “RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the 
Constitution of Maine to Establish the Right to Bodily Autonomy”
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Bill Smith, I live in Gorham and am a strong 
advocate for individual liberty and sovereignty in Maine. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify in review of LD 776.
The proposed bill LD 776 lacks a formal definition of "bodily autonomy". As a result 
the vague nature of the referendum will leave its definition to interpretation by each 
voter. I see the result of this in the confusion declared in the many testimonies 
submitted for that bill at the time I write this. 
The Maine Constitution currently states we have rights from the day we are born. 
Does our Constitution have to be amended due to the miracles of modern medicine? I 
suggest it does.
Additionally in order to perform that change to our Constitution we will need to 
define both "bodily autonomy" and formalize the relation between parents and the 
rights and bodily autonomy of children at the various times surrounding birth.
Thank you.
