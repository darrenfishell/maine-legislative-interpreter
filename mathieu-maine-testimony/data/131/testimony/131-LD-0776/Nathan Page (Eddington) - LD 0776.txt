Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable 
members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
Hello, my name is Nathan Page, l live in Eddington ME. l’m 
here to testify in opposition to LD-1619 because abortion up 
until the point of birth is murder. 
Abortion has always depended on where we draw the line, at 
first planned parenthood said abortions would be safe and 
rare, then as abortion became more and more modern, 
planned parenthood abandonded their original idea of “rare” 
abortion and now they are fighting to make it legal to murdera 
baby at any point until birth. 
Killing a baby is considered murder, why is it not considered 
murder to abort a baby hours before it could be born? People 
keep drawing these inhumane lines of when it’s “socially 
acceptable ” to murder a child. When will it stop? How much 
farther will they take it? What could be next? ln the next 
couple of years we could be fighting against the murder of 
toddlers, murder is murder and right now it seems absurd to 
take the life of a newborn or a toddler but 30 years ago 
abortion was practically unheard of so if we give them an inch, 
they’ll take it a mile. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I urge you to vote 
ought not to pass.
