Good evening Senator Carney and Representative l\/loonen, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Donna Tiemann. I am a 26-year resident of Ellsworth, Maine. l am here to testify 
in opposition to LD 1619. 
Current Maine law already allows for medical intervention in order to save a mother's life 
during stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and other life-threatening conditions. 
LD 1619 would allow a baby who is able to live outside the womb - with or without medical 
assistance - to be murdered. 
A baby is no less a helpless, defenseless human being while in the womb, than a baby after 
birth. 
This legalization of the murder of a baby is an example of the rationalization of 
evil. Rationalization is the effort of anesthetizing or palliating one's awareness of wrong 
with an illusion that some desired gain outweighs the evil ~ in this case the evil is the murder 
of an innocent, defenseless human being - a baby. 
I am also concerned that this expansion of access to abortion up to birth will increasingly 
enable and encourage the murder of babies known or believed to have physical and/or 
mental disabilities. 
Please vote to oppose LD 1619. 
Thank-you.
