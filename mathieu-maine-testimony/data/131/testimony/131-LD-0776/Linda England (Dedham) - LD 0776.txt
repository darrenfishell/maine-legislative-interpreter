Senator Carney and Representative Mooneyi,Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Linda England and l am a resident of Dedham. I have 
never done anything like this in my 65 years, but feel very compelled to speak up today. l am 
here to respectfully testify in opposition of LD1619. As a woman, mother and grandmother I 
cannot fathom that this bill is even being considered. It is purely evil. lnfanticide! Maine already 
has extreme abortion laws that allow abortions up to 24 weeks. Do we, as a state want to pass 
one of the most extreme abortion laws in the nation that would allow abortions up to birth? Our 
law already covers medical necessity abortions, so what purpose would there be to pass 
LD1619? 
Let's look at some statistics. According to Pew Research, less than 20% of voters support the 
right to an abortion in ALL cases, with no limitations. Only 20%. l have seen statistics that 
around 65% of Mainers donâ€™t agree with late term abortions, and this bill would allow full term 
abortions. t am here today testifying before you as our state legislators because you were voted 
in to represent the people of Maine. This bill does not do that. This bill would put the blood of 
innocent lives on your hands. There should be no question. LD 1619 ought not to pass. 
Thank you for your time and your service to the people of the State of Maine.
