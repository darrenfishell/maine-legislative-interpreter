Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Nancy Basham, and l’m a resident of Waldoboro. I’m here to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Life begins at conception. That’s what scienoeyphas proven. 
11' -ak-ing ‘life of -a developing [fetus is murde-r. J-t’s loo different than akriiling 
any human being. 
4 lbelie-v.e ~m.o.st human beings do not believe in »murd.e.r, abut it may bo -easier 
to choose to take the life of a human we cannot see. 
We all know, however, that an ultrasound, even at 3 or 4 months, reveals a 
human baby. There is no doubt that that baby is alive and growing. 
So how can we say that it’s ck to take the life of that growing, developing 
baby? 
But now, in the State of Maine, we are putting into the hands of our 
legislative body the right to vote to murder thousands more babies after 
they have fully developed and are preparing to enter life on earth. 
Many, many women have suffered because they chose to abort their 
babies. Women are being hurt. it’s not natural to kill your own flesh and 
blood. Women are -in a vulnerable position. They suffer from choosing 
abortion even in the earliest state of development. But aborting a FULLY 
developed baby would be devastating. 
l am here, out of my comfort zone, to plead for the life of the unborn, our 
most vulnerable human beings, who have a right to life. 
Please...do not vote for LD 1619. Please vote "ought not to pass".
