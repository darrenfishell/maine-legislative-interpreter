RE: LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
Good morning Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the 
Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Julia Fitz-Randolph and I am here today as a volunteer representing the 
Maine Unitarian Universalist State Advocacy Network (known as MUUSAN), which links 
over 2,300 members in 26 churches across the state in faith-based advocacy. lam 
testifying in support of LD1619. 
Our Unitarian Universalist faith affirms that all of our bodies are sacred and that we are 
each endowed with the twin gifts of agency and conscience. Each of us should have the 
power to decide what does and doesn’t happen to our bodies at every moment of our 
lives because consent and bodily autonomy are holy. And when disparities in resources 
or freedoms make it more difficult for certain groups of people to exercise autonomy 
over their own bodies, our faith compels us to take liberatory action. 
LD 1619 will improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws by: 
- Putting the decisions on abortions later in pregnancy in the hands of patients and 
providers; 
- Removing criminal penalties for medical providers who offer abortion care later in 
pregnancy, and support people who help someone acquire the pills for a medication 
abortion in Maine and 
- Removing antiquated and invasive data collection requirements for abortion patients 
and providers. 
Our faith impels us to advocate for the freedom to choose abortion, as well as 
comprehensive and affirming reproductive health care throughout the lifespan. 
We urge the Committee to vote to Pass LD 1619. Thank you.
