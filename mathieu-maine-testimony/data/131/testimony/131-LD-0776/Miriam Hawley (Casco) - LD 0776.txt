Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Miriam Hawiey. I am a resident of Casco anda 
single, proud mom to 3 amazing teenagers. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
For days my stomach has been in knots in anticipation of speaking before all of you. But 
when l envision the murdering of a baby, especially in his or her last days of being in the 
womb before taking its first breath, I cannot remain silent. If I were in the womb, awaiting 
birth, I would desperately want someone speaking for my life. As I believe each of you 
would. Every unborn life has been created in God’s image, just as yours and mine have 
been. God chooses life over each one of us, including our unborn. In agreement with 
God's design, l ask that you please vote against this late term abortion bill. You will 
receive G‘-od’s blessing as you agree with him in His choice for life. Thank you. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
