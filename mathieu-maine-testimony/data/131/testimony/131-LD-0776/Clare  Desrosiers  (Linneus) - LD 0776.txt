LD 776
To members of the judiciary committee:
I’m writing to ask you to oppose LD 776. By virtue of the fact that it opens a 
Pandora’s box for abuse of the concept of bodily autonomy. Arguments which seek to
enshrine an inalienable right to bodily autonomy fail to acknowledge that all our 
liberties have limits. One standard limit on our liberty is that we aren’t allowed to 
intentionally kill innocent people. Whether those other people are in utero or ex utero,
the same basic principle applies. While the writers of this proposal may be seeking to 
resolve the question of abortion, or other difficult issues like gender transition 
surgeries, they will only be opening the state up to numerous lawsuits which will 
invariably cost to state more money, and ultimately strike down the concept of 
inalienable bodily autonomy. Please save the state and citizens time and money by 
rejecting LD 776.
