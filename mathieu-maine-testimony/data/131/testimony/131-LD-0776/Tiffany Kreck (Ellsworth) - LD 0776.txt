Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, esteemed members of the committee, my name is 
Tiffany Kreck of Hancock County. l am here to ask you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1619. 
The decision to be here today is arguably one of the most difficult decisions I have made in 
some time.Everything is becoming all or nothing, but this is not where life exists. Life does not 
exist in an all or nothing black or white, left or right paradigm. And l am not here to advocate for 
the total abolition of abortion. But just like l wouldn’t want total abolition, we also should not 
support the extremity that this bill allows. 
l know there is so much debate between the two sides on this issue, both equally passionate. I 
know that for most people, they will never know what an infant in the womb looks like in real life, 
at 24 weeks gestation. But l know. And that’s what I am here to share with you today. 
l have a bi-cornuate uterus, which makes pregnancy very hard, and veiy dangerous for me. ln 
2015, l was 23 weeks 6 days pregnant when I started having contractions. My husband andl 
went to the Hospital where my OB worked, but she was not on duty that night. The OB on call 
was cold, dismissive. We were 24 hours out from the Hospital ’s resuscitation policy and to him,l 
was simply losing a fetus. 
After a lot of pushing, the OB agreed to transfer us to Bangor, where 2 neonatal specialists were 
waiting for us. But the OB stalled our transport at every turn. From IV requirements, to 
paperwork that he simply needed to sign, from the time EMS arrived at my Hospital room to the 
time we actually left the Hospital was just under an hour. 
Even in an ambulance running hot, getting from Machias to Bangor isn’t quick. It was just about 
20 minutes outside of Bangor that l gave birth.
