Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Scott Millett and I am a resident of Corinna. I am 
here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
In my shiit pocket, I am carrying a “preemie” diaper that is l % inches wide by 3 ‘/2 
inches long. One of my wife's and my grandchildren, was born ten weeks premature. 
This was the smallest diaper available at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the 
hospital where she was born, right here in Maine. She weighed only one pound, twelve 
ounces. This diaper, as tiny as it is, came up to her chest. Our son-in-law was able to 
slide his wedding ring over her arm, and it went all the way to her shoulder. By God’s 
grace I am happy to say that she is a strong, healthy, vibrant, intelligent and loving child 
that will be celebrating her eighth birthday in just a few days. We are so very thankful 
for the care a11d compassion of the entire team that worked with her, and the wonderful 
advances in medicine that are available. 
In contrast, this bill before you would allow a baby that could survive outside the womb, 
like our granddaughter, to be killed. It would also decrease criminal penalties, which 
would neither protect the child nor the mother. I urge you to consider the consequences of 
this, and also the words of the Psalmist, which reads: “I will praise Thee, for I am 
fearfully and wonderfully made...” (Psalm 139:l4). 
For over two years we have been told to follow the science concerning Covid 19. Why 
then should we ignore the science concerning those most vulnerable? We are talking 
about precious children, created in the image of God, that have no voice, and cannot 
speak for themselves. 
Please oppose this drastic bill. Do not make Maine an abortion destination state. 
Thank you for your time.
