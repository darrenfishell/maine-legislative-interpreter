Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee, 
My name is Kendra Hutchins and I live in Fairﬁeld. I am concerned that you are 
considering such action as LD 1619. l would like to speak for our most vulnerable 
children who do not yet have a voice. 
Our current abortion law already allows abortions until the baby is able to live 
outside the womb, the age of viability. Our laws also have us prosecute those who leave 
infants out in the elements to die of exposure and yet this bill wants to allow the same 
death to occur without prosecution just because of the location of the baby. If abortions 
are allowed up until birth, we will have babies of the same gestational age being given 
totally opposite care. One will receive all life—giving care possible while the other will be 
killed and thrown in the trash. 
Years ago, we lost a baby to miscarriage. At that point we found out she hada 
genetic anomaly that wouldn't let her grow anymore. This was a devastating loss to our 
family. If we had been told from the beginning that this would happen and counseled to 
abort this baby, we would not have done it. Those ﬁve months we had with her as she 
grew in my womb were precious. Life is precious no matter how large or small. 
Expanding our abortion laws in this way doesn't make sense. We protect our 
infants after birth; we should protect them before as well. Embracing death for our 
children is not something we should work towards or be proud of. 
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1619. Thank you.
