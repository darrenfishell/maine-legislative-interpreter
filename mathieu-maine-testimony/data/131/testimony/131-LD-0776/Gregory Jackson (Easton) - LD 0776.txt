Maine Judiciary Committee Hearing, May 1, 2023 
Senator Anne Carney, Representative Matt Moonen and 
Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, my name is Gregory Jackson, I live in Easton. 
I am here to voice my opposition to LD 1619. 
This is a morally, unconscionable law that will literally 
murder the life of a baby that has the right to live. 
A historic King of Israel, David expresses his understanding 
of life to God, his creator in a Psalm he wrote, 
Psalm 139:13,14- “You made all the delicate, inner 
parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s 
womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully 
complex! Your workmanship is marvelous- —and how 
well I know it.” 
What King David knew, you know, I know, as a parent or 
grandparent, at the birth of your baby or a grandchild. The 
Life of the unborn is precious and delicate. 
I appeal to you. Please vote “Qught NOT to Pass” say ‘NO’ to 
LD 1619. Save the Life of the unborn. Thank you.
