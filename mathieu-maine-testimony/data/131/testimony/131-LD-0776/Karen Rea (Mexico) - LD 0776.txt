My name is Karen Rea and I reside in Mexico. l am testifying in opposition to LD 1619 and the 
other 2 bills associated with it. This bill is suppose to improve the reproductive laws for women 
when in fact it will put women's health at a greater risk. With there being no penalty for 
performing abortions under any circumstance, how is this safe for women? Abortions will be 
taken place in unsafe and by anyone who wishes to. There is already a law in place allowing 
termination of pregnancy if the mother's life is at risk. In this state most professions need to be 
licensed. You even need a license to own a dog, but with this bill anyone will be able to perform 
an abortion with no repercussions. Talk about putting people at risk! 
Not long ago Maine celebrated the survival of a 22wk in utero baby girl. On the other hand 
another 22wk old in utero baby is not worth living??? It is ludicrous that you are choosing which 
lives are worth keeping alive. This is a very slippery slope that will lead to people choosing 
whether elderly or the disabled are worth keeping alive. l pray that you are healthy and age 
gracefully because one day someone may decide in this room that your life is not worth being 
kept alive. Thank you for your time today.
