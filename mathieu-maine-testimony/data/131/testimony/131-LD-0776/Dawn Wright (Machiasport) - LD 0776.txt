My name is Dawn Wright and I am a resident of Machiasport, Maine. I oppose LD1619. 
I have always been Pro Life and have had to accept our current laws that make abortion legal, but whenI 
heard about this bill, LD1619, I had to stand up and speak out. I could talk about my 10 kids or my new 
grand baby and how he was born at 37 weeks. I could talk about my adoptions and how that could bea 
viable solution for some mothers. I could talk about many things, but I have a few questions I believe we 
should be asking ourselves. 
How- How is this procedure done? How is a full term baby taken from its mother's womb? Maybea 
detailed description or video should be shown to the public to ensure people are educated in this area? 
Maybe the reality of it would sink in to those in favor of this bill? Why- Why do we need to change the 
laws that are already in place for abortion? Medical necessity is covered in this current law. Why do we 
need to have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the country? When- When did it come to this? 
When did â€œwe the people" decide that it is ok for an adult to end the life of a child? When did we take 
away all responsibility of the adults to the detriment of innocent human life? 
Where- Where does this extreme and scary notion end? Where is the line drawn that determines right 
from wrong? Healthy and sick? Acceptable and unacceptable? Life and death? Where is the moral high 
ground that I know we, as Mainers, strive for? 
Where is our very Lord and Creator in all of this? He is mourning for His people. This is NOT the answer 
from a loving God. This is NOT the answer for Maine! 
I strongly and wholeheartedly oppose LD1619, regarding late-term abortion. Thank you.
