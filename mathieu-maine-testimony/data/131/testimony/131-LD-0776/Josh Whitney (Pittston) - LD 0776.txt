Thank you Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Josh Whitney and I am a resident 
of Pittston. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
First and foremost I stand here according to the Almighty God of the Bible. Because of 
Jesus Christ, of God and being God in the flesh, died and rose again for the sins of 
men and to prove once for all that he is ruler of life and death. I mention all of this to lay 
open my basis for why I stand here today against LD 1619. Unlike you, esteemed 
committee members, I have a foundation for truth that extends beyond my own 
experience. While some of you may want to extend the killing of innocent blood for the 
sake of convenience, I firmly believe in the value and dignity for womenâ€™s lives. It is an 
indisputable fact that children, gestating in the mothers womb are indeed humans, we 
must be consistent in also calling them persons. Unless you want to open up the 
possibility of calling some born people not persons based on dependence. 
My wife and I have been married for 10 years and we have not been blessed with 
children yet and it seems to be medical. We have been available and willing to adopt 
any of these children from women who do not want, or cannot take care of, them. 
However, out of the estimated 2,000 children a year, or 6 children a day, killed in the 
state of Maine every year, none of these women have let us help them. You, as part of 
our representatives, must stop with this bill to expand abortion for any reason up to9 
months, and stop killing all children in the womb, and give these beautiful children a 
chance to live their lives. 
Lastly, I call on all of you, to repent of this wickedness, repent of your sin, and turn to 
Jesus. Who is able to forgive you just as he has forgiven me of all of my sin and 
wickedness. Please, turn away from the death and evil that has been permitted for so 
long, and turn to life. 
Thank you.
