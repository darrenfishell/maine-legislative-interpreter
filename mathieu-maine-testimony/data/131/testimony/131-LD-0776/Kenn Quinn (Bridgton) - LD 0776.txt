Testimony Opposed to LD 1619 
Submitted by Kenn Quinn, Bridgton, ME 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Kenn Quinn, and I am a resident of Bridgton. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence 
"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable Rights," We are not born equal; we are created equal. This unique creation of 
human life needs to be valued by our laws and protected, not destroyed. 
As we all know, the self-evident fact of equality that Jefferson wrote about was not 
automatically a reality for people in our country. We had to ﬁght a Civil War to achieve it 
and defend it years later with the Civil Rights Movement to protect the value of human 
life. The goal of forming a more perfect Union will never be achieved in this country as 
long as we continue to disregard the value of ALL human life. 
I cannot understand how we can pass a law to protect the eggs of our national symbol, the 
American Bald Eagle, the very symbol of Strength, Freedom, and Liberty, a violation of 
which can be a ﬁne of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year, or both, and at the same 
time pass a law that allows the taking of a precious human life up until the day of birth 
Without any penalty and without needing a medical license. 
Have we fallen this far in depravity, where a bird's egg is valued more than a precious 
boy or girl made in the image of God? 
Please do not pass LD 1619. 
Sincerely, 
Kenn Quinn 
Bridgton, Maine
