Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
My name is Linda McMahon. I am a Registered Nurse from Harpswell. 
I am here today to oppose LD 1619 and ask that you please vote. 
“Ought Not to Pass.” 
Until last Thursday I thought that I had a great testimony to present. I was 
talking with my brother about another matter and my polite reaction to it. 
His response shocked me. He said, “The problem is that you are just too 
nice. Quit sugarcoating crap!" So that is what I am doing today, not 
sugarcoating! 
Maine has an abortion law and does not need a new one, especially one as 
extreme as LD 1619. 
Late term abortions are brutal and barbaric. They take days and are neither 
humane nor pain-free. Adults will whine at simple papercuts. What do you 
think these babies feel when their arms and legs are being cut off or when 
their skulls are being crushed during the abortion process? In what way can 
any of these late term abortions be considered healthcare? Does it sicken 
you to hear what I am saying? Well, good. I hope so because abortion is 
sickening. 
If you cast your vote that it is OK to kill a baby until the moment of birth, be 
prepared from that day forward when you look in the mirror every morning 
and every night to remember the consequences of your vote. 
Should you vote “Ought to Pass" LD 1619, from that moment on at every 
birthday party remember your vote. Every time you hear “Happy Birthday ” 
remember your vote. Your legacy now will be- 
Yes, I voted that it is OK to kill children on their birthday. 
Maine has an abortion law-it does not need LD 1619. 
Please do the right thing, the moral thing, the ethical thing, and vote 
“Ought Not to Pass” on LD 1619. 
I thank you for this opportunity to testify.
