My name is Audrey Wimmer, I live in Stockholm, and I’m l6 years old. I am testifying in 
opposition of LD #1619. I believe that it is going to affect my generation greatly. The current 
Maine law states that abortion is legal up to viability when the baby can survive outside the 
mother. If a baby can survive outside its mother, that means that it is alive. It has a life. 
So many people in my generation struggle with their mental health and suicide is a major issue 
among teenagers and young adults. By terminating viable pregnancies, we are being shown that 
life doesn't matter, that it isn't important. This bill is not good for my generation. It’s not only 
about the babies losing their lives even though that is exceedingly important, but it's also about 
the citizens of Maine, teenagers, and adults, seeing that people around them don't value life. 
Life is precious. Your life, my life, and these babies‘ lives. By letting this bill pass, my 
generation is shown that lives are disposable. This isn’t healthy or beneﬁcial to our society. 
Please show my generation that life matters and vote no on this bill.
