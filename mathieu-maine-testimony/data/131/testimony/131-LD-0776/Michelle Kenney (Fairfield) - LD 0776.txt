Testimony LD1619 
May 1, 2023 
Good Afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My name is Michelle Kenney, I live in Fairfield, where I grew up. In 
1990 I was pregnant with twins, my second pregnancy. At 13 weeksI 
had adverse diagnosis and I was advised to abort them as they would 
not survive. I knew their lives were not in my hands or any other 
human hands for that matter. I did not attend church or trust in Jesus 
but I knew only God is the author of life. As the weeks passed by, my 
biweekly ultrasounds showed improvement. I gave birth at 36% 
weeks to two healthy baby boys, who are now 32 going on 33! Years 
later as I got to know Jesus, he revealed how he blessed my labor and 
c-section with little to no pain. I know of two other women who had 
different adverse diagnoses at the same time. One chose the same 
path as I and had a healthy baby. One chose abortion and when the 
lab work returned on the aborted fetus they were told their baby was 
healthy. The doctor thought nothing of how devastating this news was 
to the married couple excited for their first baby. 
John 10:10 states that: "The thief comes only to steal and kill and 
destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the fuII.‚Äù 
Let's be clear here, the thief is the destroyer and Jesus the life giver. 
In the end the blood of the unborn will be on your hands if you support 
expanding abortion. 
Vote ought Not to pass on LD1619 
Sincerely, 
Michelle D~Kenney
