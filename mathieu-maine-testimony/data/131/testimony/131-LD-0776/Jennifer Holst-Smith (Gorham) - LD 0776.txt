Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary.
My name is Jennifer Smith and I live in Gorham and I am here in support of LD776.
Bodily autonomy includes freedom from the imposition or infliction of another’s 
views or beliefs upon our person. We are free to interact with our creator and creation 
as we deem fit as long as no other person’s rights are imposed upon by our actions.
Medical mandates imposing experimental or life altering procedures such as abortions
on viable children in the womb, untested gene therapy mandates or forced mental 
health treatments have no place in our state.
Please vote ought pass for LD776.
Thank you.
