LD 776
I strongly oppose LD 776 as it is nothing more than an attempt to promote depravity 
and unseemly acts against nature and God’s Law.
I remind you that you merely have delegated authority on this earth and do not have 
authority to enact law contrary to God’s Natural Law.
Repent and oppose this proposed bill
