Autonomy 
  
 
Memorandum of Opposition 
Date:  May 12, 2023 
To:  Honorable Members of the Committee On Judiciary. 
From:  Jonathan Martell  
RE: LD 776 RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish the Right to 
Bodily Autonomy 
 
Members of the committee, I would like to express my Opposition  of LD 776 RESOLUTION, Proposing an 
Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to Establish the Right to Bodily Autonomy. 
 
My Name is Jonathan Martell. I am a Sanford City Councilor, and lifelong resident of Maine.   
 
While I believe in personal freedom and bodily rights, the intent of the bill is quite the opposite. I had to look up 
the sponsor, and noticed a D next to their name. That along with the other testimony indicates that this bill will be 
used to further abortion, and child mutilation.  
 
The Maine Constitution states in Article 1. Section 1.  Natural rights.  All people are born equally free and 
independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and 
defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety 
and happiness. 
 
This seems to adequately cover bodily autonomy. It is however ignored by the Mills administration and the 
legislature, when 20% of the medical workforce has been fired in Maine. Again, when unborn babies and 
children are mutilated or killed. Again, when human trafficking is allowed to continue in Maine. Again, when 
infringements on Second Amendment rights are being discussed weekly. Again, when parents are stripped of 
their children because they disagree with school propaganda and brainwashing when it comes go gender.  
 
 
Please recognize this for what it is, and vote ought not to pass.   
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jonathan Martell 
Sanford, ME 
Sanford City Councilor
