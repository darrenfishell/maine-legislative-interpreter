Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, honourable members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary. My name is Elizabeth Cain and I live in Littleton. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619. 
It is not needed because current law already allows for medical necessity and cases of still birth, ectopic 
pregnancy, etcetera. I am opposed to LD 1619 because abortion has been used to cover up the crime of 
rape. I myself was trafficked as a young child. I was below the age of becoming pregnant, but I know girls 
have been coerced and/or forced to have abortion so they can and could be continually abused by their 
perpetrators. I have PTSD, traumatic flashbacks from my childhood, and Dissociative Identity Disorder 
because of the evil done to me. The older girls who became pregnant had more evil done to them 
because of abortion. At the age of 30, I had lost my fourth child because of a miscarriage. I deal with that 
loss and miss that child every day on top of my PTSD. I can't imagine the loss other girls go through who 
are coerced to abort on top of their PTSD from the original crime. Abortion does not help these girls but 
compounds their grief. On another note, I have personally seen the grief of a friend whose teen girlfriend 
had an abortion without telling him beforehand. He has grieved for 30 years. I have a closer friend who is 
grieving the loss of a grandchild through her son's past girlfriend. Potential grandparents and fathers are 
not spoken about enough. Abortion hurts female victims, men, siblings, and grandparents. 
Thank you for listening to me. 
Please vote ought not to pass
