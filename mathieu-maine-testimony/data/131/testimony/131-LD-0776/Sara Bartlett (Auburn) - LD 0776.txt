Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee. l am the 
Rev. Sara Bartlett. I live in Auburn, and the church I serve is in the Oxford Hills area where I am 
an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ. I Urge you to vote for LD 1619 and LD 
1343. 
The ability of a person to access appropriate medical care is most important, yet continually not 
accessible, for those who are low income or for other reasons do not have access to what they, 
and their doctors, deem best practice for their situation. As an ordained pastor, I am called to 
speak on behalf of those who live on the margins of society and for those who cannot speak for 
themselves. I stand before you all to advocate for all persons, and their doctors, to be able to 
have access to what is needed for anyone who needs appropriate reproductive healthcare. 
I first learned about the importance of appropriate reproductive care from my maternal 
grandmother, and my mother; both were nurses in Maine in the mid 20th century and would tell 
stories of patients who found themselves pregnant and unable to access the medical care they 
needed for their own bodies. The results were disastrous; patients died. 
Throughout my life I continue to hear stories of those who have been unable to access 
appropriate reproductive care. This is not what my Christian faith wants for humankind. Jesus 
was one who healed women when they were bleeding, often those women who society ignored 
Today, you have an opportunity to help make sure every Mainer can access the care they need 
and every medical provider can be empowered to give that care. 
I encourage you to support LD1619 and LD 1343.
