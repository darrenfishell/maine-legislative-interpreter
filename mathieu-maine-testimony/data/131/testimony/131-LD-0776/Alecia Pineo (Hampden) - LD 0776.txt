Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Alecia Pineo, and l am a resident of Hampden. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
I am honored to be the mother of Ô¨Åve children. Four of them I carried to term and had 
healthy deliveries. My fourth child, a little boy named Joel, died in the womb during my 
second trimester. I was able to hold him for a while after his delivery. He was beautiful. 
What struck me was how even though he was small, his tiny feet were the exact replica 
of my husband's, his Daddy. He was a dear baby, with all the recognizable features ofa 
full grown human being, and yet under the current law, his life would not be valued. LD 
1619 takes this to an even further extreme. 
Taking the life of an innocent human being is wrong. The only things standing in the way 
of rights for these dear children are size, level of development, environment and 
dependency. l ask you to consider, how long will it be before this same criteria is applied 
to those outside the womb? , 
l am a woman that does not want the right to end the life of another, and l am asking 
you to vote ought not to pass.
