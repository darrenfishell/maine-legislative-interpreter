Hello, Re LD1619 OUGHT NOT TO PASS 
Please seriously consider the following words. I urge you to think hard 
and responsibly about: Life, Family, Basic Biology, Common Sense and 
accountability. Again: Life, Family, Basic Biology, Common Sense and 
accountability. 
Because I still have a little Maine Farmer in my blood, I use this analogy: 
A farmer and his family depend on their animals and care for them, just 
like our society takes care of our people in this life. Back on the farm we 
loved our animals but if we didn't do our chores and harmed the 
animals, trust me, we kids would be made accountable to our father, 
Farmer Brown. As a young boy I learned about the biology of birth, 
witnessing the miracle of a calf being born. My Dad, of course, knew 
our cow was pregnant and knew the birth would take place in God's 
time, not ours. Dad didn't think in terms of the calf's life or it's birth as 
being a burden. Quite the contrary. Sure, farm life is tough but all life is 
tough, isn't it? When the calf would be born, no matter when —- we 
would be inconvenienced but also blessed with new life. 
lt would make absolutely no sense if somebody killed that calf in the 
womb —that viable, blood/heart-pumping, moving, beautiful (to us) 
calf. If someone did, well, there'd be hell to pay because the unborn 
calf had value and would be contributing to our life. That death would 
have had quite an impact on us. 
Friends, you will find accountability, if not in this life, the next. 
We are not calfs. We are more than that. We are living, human souls. 
lf you want to kill somebody — kill this bill instead. Thank you, 
Randy Brown
