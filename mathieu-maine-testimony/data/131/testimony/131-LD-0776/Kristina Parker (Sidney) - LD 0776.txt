Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Kristina C. Parker, and I live in Sidney. I am seventeen years old, and I ama 
Christian conservative activist. I am also the secretary for the Turning Point USA Kennebec 
County Chapter. However, today I am here on behalf of myself, and I am speaking up for the 
unborn children of Maine who cannot speak for themselves. 
Making late-term abortion legal in Maine is too extreme and too cruel for its people. Life isa 
frm morality and it is a right that must not be questioned. 
I hope we can all agree that murder is wrong. Murder being, intentionally taking the life of an 
innocent human being. Abortion kills an innocent, helpless child. Therefore, abortion is wrong. 
There is no reasonable, moral argument to say otherwise. 
Nearly 250 years ago, when our nation was beginning its legacy, our founding fathers said that 
the following truths are self-evident; That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable rights, those rights being Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of 
Happiness. Voting to pass LDl6l9 would be infringing on the rights of unborn Maine citizens. It 
would be taking away their rights for a chance at the American Dream and a life in the land of 
opportunity. 
Please, for the sake of all Maine citizens, born and unborn, reject this drastic bill, LDl6l9. 
Thank you for your time, and l welcome any questions.
