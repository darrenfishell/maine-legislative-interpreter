Senator Carney and Representative Moone, Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciaiy, my name is Aimee Dalton 
and l am a resident of Wilton. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
Maybe you have read the article that circulated on the internet years 
ago, written from the perspective of a neonatal intensive care unit 
nurse. The article mentions several different aspects that the author 
didn’t anticipate as being part of her worksuch as, hearing alarms 
going off in her sleep from her home or willing with every fiber of her 
being that the preemie in her care would survive the night, and the 
pride and sense of accomplishment she feels on the day when one 
that she has worked tirelessly over gets discharged. The author 
begins each line with “They don’t tell you...” l wonder what she would 
add to her list in response to LD 1619. 
After having read this article l can't help but wonder how some babies‘ 
lives are seen as valuable and some are discarded. To the ones 
viewed as valuable, Doctors and nurses are regarded as heroes as 
they fight to maintain the smoldering wick of the tiny life in their care. 
While for the babies whose lives are viewed as worthless, the same 
doctors who have taken the Hippocratic Oath, with one of the 
promises within that oath being "first, do no harm" will snuff out their 
tiny lives in the womb of their mother. lf that wasn’t bad enough, 
Governor Mills‘ radical bill would allow others who are not even 
Medical Dr’s the ability to stop a viable baby's heart and dilate and 
evacuate a mothers womb. How can this be? l beseech you Senator 
Carney and Representative Moone, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, the passing of this bill is in your 
hands but by your vote you can stop this heinous practice from being 
allowed in our state. Please vote No on LD 1619.
