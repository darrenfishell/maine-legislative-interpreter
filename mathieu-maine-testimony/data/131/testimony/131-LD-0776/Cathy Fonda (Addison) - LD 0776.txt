Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary: 
My name is Cathy Fonda, and I'm a resident of Addison. l’m here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
This bill removes the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without being licensed asa 
physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse and for performing an abortion 
after viability of the fetus when it is not necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the 
mother. 
Since the abortion industry wants to claim that abortion is healthcare, why are they removing the 
requirement for licensed personnel to perform the abortion? Most healthcare is carried out by licensed 
personnel and is directed toward returning health to the client. Abortion seems to be the only 
procedure that is aimed at the death of the client. Yet, why should it be considered different relative to 
the licensure of the person performing it, since the health of another person (the mother) is also at 
stake? l personally would not want an unlicensed person to perform any procedure on me or on 
anyone in my family, not even on a pet. This includes medication that would present the same result.

On a different note, the ﬁrst human right is the right to life. The practice of abortion certainly violates 
that right of every person who is aborted. No matter at what stage a person‘is aborted, the entire 
populace suffers due to the loss of that person's personality, gifts, talents, interests, etc. The cultural, 
ﬁnancial, societal, relational abilities of the whole society are diminished by withdrawing that person 
from the society.=

Every baby is placed in a woman’s womb by God and that individual has a plan for his/her life 
assigned by God. Who are we to deny that life? 
Thank you for your time today. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
