Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, My name. is Kelly Danielson_and.l ama resident 
of Buckﬁeld. l am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
I am not one to normally get involved with politics. l have never attended a public 
hearing before to make my voice. known. l am not a. mother. However, I am a.l 
woman who cares deeply about the direction Maine is heading with this proposal 
to expand the current abortion law up to nine months full term. I can not wrap my 
head around terminating the life ofa baby that has reached the point of viability 
outsidethe. womb. That is a. practiceforba rbarians. ltis nota. practice for the 
Maine way of life. The fetus has a right to life. The only difference I see ina 
spontaneous premature birth, where the medical community moves heaven and 
earth to save the newborn, and in the late term abortion of a baby who would be 
prematurely removed from its motherls body is that.one.childis wantedand the 
other is not. l am a nurse. l understand that this is a highly charged emotional 
issue. But for the sake of these children, we cannot be led by emotion. We need 
to follow the medical science we have today. After the point of viability, how can 
we, as a society.in.good.conscience.deny the.science.that.shows us that.these. 
fetuses are indeed viable human beings. To abort them at this point is indeed 
murder in the ﬁrst degree. We in Maine can do better. and it starts with leading by 
example and saying.NO.to. late term. abortions.
