Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Alisha Bragg and I am a resident 
of Sidney. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
The thought of carrying a baby to full term and then not having the reward of 
their presence earth-side is barbaric. 
Before the arrival of my two red-headed daughters, I had two miscarriages. 
The physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual toll that those took on me are hard to 
describe. I got so used to throwing up that I could open a car door quickly and 
continue on my commute without much of a pause. I would vomit a dozen timesa 
day or more. I would say â€œfor the joy set before me" and press on with the dreadful 
pregnancy symptoms. However, when Ih _8d.tQ part with those precious cells at 16 
and then 10 weeks I was left feeling hollow. I would have been able to rationalize the 
suffering if I had a baby in my arms at the end of it all. The grief that enveloped me 
after my miscarriages was a kind of burden that I had never known before. 
Physically, I was so very depleted, and discovered that I had a significant B12 
deficiency and my body was not up taking orabsorbing it as it should due toa 
genetic methylation issue. I am so gratefulfor my two healthy pregnancies that my 
body was able to bring to full-term. Since then I have needed over a 4 year break 
before conceiving again to bring my levels up to a healthy pregnancy place. 
All this to say, in my opinion this bill is not pro-woman. Why would there be 
allowances for women to pour their own bodies nutritional reserves for MONTHS 
into growing a human. Further, the negative impact that this bill will have emotionally 
and mentally if it passes is massive. Please consider the multifaceted and 
unnecessary burden that this would place on the women in Maine. 
Thank you for your time, 
Alisha Bragg 
Sidney
