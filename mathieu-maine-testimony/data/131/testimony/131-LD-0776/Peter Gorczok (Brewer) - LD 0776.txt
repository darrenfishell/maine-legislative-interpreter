LD 776
Life begins at conception. All three bills being proposed (LD 776, LD 1343 and LD 
1619) are heartless, radical and extreme. It is an absolute moral disgrace to the state of
Maine to pass any of these bills. I hope that through this testimony, and the testimony 
of others given today, it is made clear that the people of Maine value life, including 
life in the womb
