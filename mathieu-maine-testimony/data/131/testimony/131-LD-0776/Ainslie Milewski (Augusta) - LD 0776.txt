Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, 
My name is Ainslie Milewski, I am from Augusta, Maine, and I am seventeen years old. I am here before 
you today in respectful opposition to LD 1619, and I urge you to vote ought not to pass. While I stand 
here with no degree, no fully developed frontal lobe, I can also stand here and tell you that this debate 
over LD 1619 is one of morality and ethics rather than politics. 
As a young woman, and a believer in God and the Bible, ﬁrst and foremost I believe that life begins in the 
womb at conception. But if I did not believe that to begin with, I would have needed to ask myself WhatI 
did believe in. And I’ve found that many people believe and agree with science. We have heard from so 
many that these babies, these unbom children, are not alive because they are just mere clumps of cells. 
But what I Would ask in return is, how come cells are considered one of the eight characteristics of life? 
These characteristics, or attributes, of life are what most of us probably learned in biology. I just took this 
class last year myself. But What I learned in that class was this: in order for something to be considered 
living, or alive, they needed eight speciﬁc qualiﬁcations. These included: response, cells, growth and 
change, reproduction, metabolism, homeostasis, energy processing, and organization. When one takes the 
time to look at these attributes and compare them against a child in the Womb, it is noticed that each of 
these characteristics pertains to an unborn child. 
Once again, I am here today to urge you to vote ought not to pass for the LD 1619 bill. I thank you for 
your time and consideration, God bless. _
