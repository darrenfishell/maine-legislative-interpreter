Jennifer  Ruggiero
Portland
LD 776
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Members of the Judiciary Committee, 
my name is Jennifer Ruggiero, I live in Portland, and I urge you to vote Ought to Pass
on LD 1619, LD 1343, and LD 776.
People’s feelings shouldn’t dictate medical decisions. People’s beliefs shouldn’t 
dictate medical decisions. People’s religious convictions shouldn’t dictate medical 
decisions for another person. Another’s worry of the potential regret or emotional 
response someone might have to an action is theirs not mine. Every person must 
manage their own person. A freedom or right doesn’t strip others from abstaining 
from pursuing choice, it only allows those in circumstances that need to make 
decisions the ability to do so.
I want to know that when any person seeks medical attention it is based on science 
and the latest medical research and that it is not based a politician’s platform or 
someone else’s religion. I want to know that medical professionals must provide care 
consistent with standards set by the medical community and care won’t be based on 
the provider’s particular beliefs or a politician’s whim. 
Debates rage about the definition of when life begins, the value of life, the right of 
something currently in progress of being formed. Though there are concrete truths in 
life, these a just social relativities evidenced by the wide-ranging policies present in 
other cultures. One truth is that without bodily autonomy we are not at liberty to make
the best decisions for ourselves. Bodily autonomy should be a guaranteed right, in all 
aspects of life, and particularly with respect to healthcare.
For these reasons, please vote Ought to Pass on LD 1619, LD 1343, LD 776. Thank 
you for your time.
