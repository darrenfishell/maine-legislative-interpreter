Senator Carney, Representative Mooney] and Honorable members of the Judiciary 
committee. 
My name is Daniel Scott, and lam a resident of Eddington. I am here to speak in opposition 
to LD 1619. 
In the past Governor Mills has stated that she didn't feel that Maine's current abortion law 
needed to change. So what’s different now? Currently abortion in Maine is available on 
demand, anytime, without medical reason until a baby reaches viability (approximately 24 
weeks). With the new law, l\/laine would have one of the most extreme abortion laws in the 
entire country. We don’t need Maine abortion tourism. 
According to Pew Research, less than 20% of voters support the right to an abortion in all 
cases, leaving 80% who support abortion with limitations. 
Dr. Jerome Leleune, the father of modern genetics, has said, "biologically, human 
development begins at fertilization" . 
On a more personal note, my son Daniel was born with Down Syndrome. That diagnosis, in 
and of itself, would have beenjustification for having an abortion. instead my son liveda 
very successful, rewarding, and abundant life. l-le became an Eagle Scout, served on the 
State of l\/laine Disability Committee, and learned sign language by attending an adult 
education class. He did this so he could communicate with a friend at his day program who 
was hearing impaired. 
There is no such thing as a "humane" abortion. "ln the Womb" , an article in a 2005 National 
Geographic states, "To deny when life begins, should not be made a basis for legalizing 
abortions" . 
Thank you for your time and careful attention to this very significant issue.

Daniel N. Sco
