Senator.Carney andRepresentative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Judiciary. Committee. My name 
is Isaac Gendron and I'm the baby that was just spoken about. ..t 
Psalms 139:13-16 
“For you created my inmost being, you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am 
fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden 
from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. 
Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of 
them came to be." 
I’m grateful that my family w0uldn’t consider abortion even for a second. It pains me to think that we 
would prioritize women's rights over the basic human right to life. Medical professionals are supposed to 
protect life, not end it. 
Please vote ought not to pass. Thank you.'
