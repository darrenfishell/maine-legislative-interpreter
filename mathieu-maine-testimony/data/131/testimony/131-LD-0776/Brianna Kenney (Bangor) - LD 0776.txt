Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing committee on judiciary: 
My name is Brianna Kenney and I am a resident of Bangor Maine. 
In computer programming, each capability of the system is generated by the 
programmer, using thousands of combinations of zero and one. These 
combinations give the computer instructions on how to complete various complex 
tasks, and are designed for a specific purpose. I use this analogy today to speak 
about the design of the very cells in your body, each cell’s function is instructed 
through the precise and intentional creation of codes in your DNA. Instead of 
zeros and ones, our DNA, and that of our children is a code 3 billions letters long, 
consisting of combinations of A, G, T, and C, or Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and 
Cytosine. Each letter combination instructs our bodies on how to complete 
complex functions, and much like a computer program being designed bya 
programmer, our very cells are brought into being and developed by God. l say 
this to tell you today that every baby inside of a mothers womb is created and 
developed, cell by cell by the very God who breathes life into your body and life 
into every child that He intricately designs and fully loves. The Bible says, in Psalm 
139 verses 13 and 14b, “You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit 
me together in my mothers womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully 
complex. ” 
I wish to end with another piece of scripture found in Deuteronomy 30, verses 19 
and 20 which state... ”Today l have given you the choice between life and death, 
between blessings and curses. Now l call on Heaven to witness the choice you 
make. Oh, that you choose life, so that you and your descendants might livel”. 
Thank you, and please vote ought not to pass.
