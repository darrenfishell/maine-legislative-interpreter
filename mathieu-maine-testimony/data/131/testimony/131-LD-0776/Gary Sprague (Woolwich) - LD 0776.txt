Senator Carney and Representative Mooney, Honorable members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Gary Sprague and I live in 
Woolwich. 
I'm here today to testify in opposition to LD-1619. This is a huge 
expansion of a law that has been on the books for 30 years. The idea of 
allowing abortions at any time for any reason up to the moment of birth is 
unthinkable. This bill would allow a baby that could survive outside her 
mother's womb to be killed. This is just plain wrong and a horrible thing to 
consider. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about it. I've explained 
to a number of people what the viability language in the current law means 
and the ramifications of removing the language and every last person's 
reaction was disbelief that this is even being considered. 
Maine law already allows for intervention if the mother's life or health 
is in jeopardy, as in the case of something like a stillbirth or an ectopic 
pregnancy. 
If passed Maine will have one of the most extreme abortion laws in our 
country.Is this really where we want to go? I don't think so. 
Please vote against LD-1619. 
Thank you! 
Gary Sprague
