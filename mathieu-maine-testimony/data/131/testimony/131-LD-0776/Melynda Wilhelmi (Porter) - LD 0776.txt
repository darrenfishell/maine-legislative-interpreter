LD 1619 Hearing 
Speak Up For Life 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary, my name is Melynda Vlﬁlhelmi and I am a resident of Porter Maine.I 
am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
When I was 20 years old I became pregnant. It was my one and only opportunity to havea 
child. At 34.5 weeks my water broke and I was set to deliver. What happened next was out of 
my control as my son sustained a traumatic brain injury during the birthing process. Here are 
some facts about my son: At 34.5 weeks he weighed 5lbs. 8oz, was 20 ‘A inches long and had 
fully developed lungs. Had he not sustained a brain injury we would have been able to bring him 
home within a few days. We were told that if I had gone full term he would have weighed about 
10 lbs. I 
I have always supported the pro choice movement, however my stance has changed after 
learning about the LD 1619 bill regarding late term/full term abortion. 
Many medical advances have been made since 1973 Roe vs. Wade. Recently I read an article 
about a 22 week (gestation) age child in l\/laine going home. 
Maine already has 24 week abortion on the books, Maine already allows medical reasons to 
terminate after this date. 
I urge you to vote AGAINST this bill as it would make Maine one of the most excessive abortion 
laws in the country. Maine has always been known as “Vacation Land" , allowing on-demand, full 
term abortions is not something I want Maine to be known for. 
Again I urge you to vote against this bill. Thank you for your time and consideration and the 
opportunity to voice my concerns as a lifetime Maine resident.
