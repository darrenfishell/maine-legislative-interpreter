Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Theodore Bragg, and I ama 
resident of Newport. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
As there are many women who regret having an abortion, and would turn 
back the clock if they could, I believe lengthening the amount of time for an 
abortion, up to the time a baby is ready to be born, would only make this 
problem worse, as there is more attachment to the baby over the length of 
the pregnancy, and there are pregnancy resource centers throughout the 
state that offer other options. 
I do believe that lengthening the amount of time for an abortion, up to the 
time a baby is ready to be born, is unnecessary and to the detriment of 
many. 
I therefore ask that you oppose this extreme and unnecessary bill, thank 
you.
