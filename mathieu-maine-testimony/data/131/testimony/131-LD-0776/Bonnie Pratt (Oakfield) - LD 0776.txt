Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the Maine Judiciary 
Committee: 
I am Bonnie Pratt. I live in Oakﬁeld, Maine, and I am here to oppose LD 1619, 
“An Act to Improve Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Laws,” which is sponsored by 
Representative Talbot Ross. 
Mothers get promoted to Grandmothers; Fathers get promoted to Grandfathers, 
and those promotions are celebrated. Those promotions will no longer be given, if 
abortions become even more available. 
My little granddaughter asked, “ Gramma, are you and Grampa going up to God?” 
I said, “Not today, not tomorrow. I want to watch you grow up.” 
The next day she asked me the same question: “ Gramma, are you and Grampa 
going up to God?” 
I said “Not today, not tomorrow, but some day.” Realizing this seemed heavyon 
her, I said, “Do you want to know Whatl am going to do when I go up to God in Heaven? 
I am going to ask God if I can have a job in Heaven rocking babies. Do you thinkI 
would make a good baby-rocker? ” 
She said, Yuh.” It settled her and she has never asked this question again. 
Last week her little pet sheep died. There were tears, grief, and a proper burial. 
Grampa held her, Gramma talked to her. 
Are there tears‘? Is there grief? What about a proper burial? For the ﬁve babies 
aborted every day in Maine? 
Please do not forward LD 1619. 
Thank you for your time and attention.
