TESTIMONY AGAINST LD1619 (2023) 
May 1, 2023 
Senator (Iarney and Representative Mooney, Honorable members of the 
Joint Standing Committee of the Judiciary, my name is Norman Moyer,I 
am a resident of Waterville. I am here today in opposition to LD1619. 
I was reading the other day these words: ”Speak up for those who 
cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. 
Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."1 
These words are one of the reasons I am here today. . 
Our second daughter was born June 26"‘ , 1982. From the beginning of 
contractions to her birth took just 1 hour. We were at our home in Bass 
Harbor. I literally caught her with my hands. She didn't seem to be 
breathing. She would later. At the hospital she was found to have the 
deadly infection, group strep B. By herself, she was poor and needy, 
even destitute. But she had us and a whole medical team supporting 
her. She is now 40 years old. 
However, LD1619 leaves viable humans, who are poor and needy, with 
questionable support. It even opens the door for unlicensed people to 
end their life. I fear what will occur if this bill passes with its current 
wording. I fear for the loss of life and harm to the mother and father. 
Please vote to reject this bill. Thank you for your time.
