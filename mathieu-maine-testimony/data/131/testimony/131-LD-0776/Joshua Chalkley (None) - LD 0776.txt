Fellow Mainers, 
My name is Joshua Chalkley and I am here on behalf of the unborn. I oppose bill LDl6l9 
and I request that you vote against it. Abortion is immoral because it unjustly deprives a human 
being its existence and future. In my own story, I narrowly escaped abortion. My biithmother 
was advised by doctors, friends, and family to get rid of me when I was in the womb. I know that 
she must have suffered from anxiety, insecurity, and depression to bear me into this world, but 
she still decided to give life. I stand in front of you as someone who was given the right to life 
and I will continue to stand up for others who are defenseless. They have no voice, yet there are 
those who are intent on silencing them altogether. Why are you so concentrated on silencing a 
baby? We are their voice, and we stand up for the unborn at all stages. I personally believe that 
life begins at conception. In the womb is a helpless, innocent baby, whose story has just begun. 
The Bible tells us in Psalm 139:13~16 that: “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me 
together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful 
are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was 
being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed 
substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when 
as yet there was none of them.” Each of us has been created for a purpose by God and each of us 
should be allowed the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. In conclusion, I appeal 
again that you will vote against bill LDl6l9. As your constituent and fellow Mainer I hope and 
pray that you will choose the right decision. Thank you for your time.
