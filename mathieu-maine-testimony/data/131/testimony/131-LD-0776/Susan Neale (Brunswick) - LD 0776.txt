Dear Chairs Senator Carney and Representative Moonen and All Judiciary Committee Members 
My name is Susan Neale , and I am a resident of Brunswick, Maine . I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619 
No matter what your opinion on abortion may be, taking the life of a fetus at the time of birth is 
morally wrong. This is not and has never been how we value individual human beings. 
If LD l6l 9 passes, these “could be infants” will have absolutely no say one way or the other if they 
live or die; 
These babies could and should become toddlers who will bring untold happiness to their parents 
while learning to walk and to talk;- 
They will then become youngsters who will be bouncing on fumiture and running around the house; 
They will grow to be young kids who will be playing, giggling and screeching with excitement on 
the playground with others of similar age; 
These will be children who will hopefully emulate their parents as role models all throughout school; 
They will eventually be young adults who will go out into the work force to become productive 
citizens and eventually start a family of their own; 
They will be athletes, doctors, lawyers, scientists, entertainers, business owners or people who build 
things, ﬁx things, grow food and deliver goods and services to your home. 
Then, the cycle begins all over again as it has throughout the course of western civilization. Why are 
a small minority trying to destroy that? , 
Contrary to the current negative accounts, the positives far outweigh the bad when it comes to the 
most precious among us. . 
And, although our country is not perfect, it has been unquestionably the primary country that offers 
the greatest opportunities to all of its children...but, the child deserves to at least FIRST be given that 
chance at life. 
Therefore, I am urging you to vote "Ought NOT to Pass" on LD 1619.
