Senator Carney and Representativeivloonen, Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary, 
My name is Angie Anderson. I am a born and raised i\/lainer and the mother of 
three children. Back in 2015, it was with greatjoy that my husband and i returned 
to Maine to raise our children after he served nine years on active duty in the 
United States Marine Corps. Spotting that sign as we drove over the bridge from 
New Hampshire, seeing it with fresh perspective, "Maine, The Way Life Should 
Be" . There was a hopeful expectation in our hearts as we started fresh in our 
beloved home state. 
As a woman, wife, mother, and ultimately a follower oflesus Christ, it is my duty 
to remind you of the very words in which we greet native and foreigner alike. 
How can we boast about offering a way that LIFE should be when we are gathered 
here today over a bill that reeks of death? The laws of Maine already allow for 
abortion to a certain point of viability and yet that is not enough? Where will the 
depravity end? When huge portions and multiple generations have been deprived 
of LIFE, who will take care of you as you age? It will be someone who was given 
the opportunity to live. There IS a choice to be made here, which is whyl urge you 
to vote OUGHT NOT TO PASS on LD1619. 
Thank you.
