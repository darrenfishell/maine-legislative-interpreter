Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Donna Rush and I am a resident of Hermon, Maine. 
I strongly oppose LD 1619. I believe life begins at conception, that a beating heart is proof of 
life. Godâ€™s word tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made and that children are a gift 
from God. All life is precious, especially the unborn child. I have four children and I can't imagine 
willingly taking their lives from them. 
I strongly emphasize, please Judiciary Committee, please vote ought not to pass. I believe it is 
murder in the first degree and an abomination to our God! 
Thank you.
