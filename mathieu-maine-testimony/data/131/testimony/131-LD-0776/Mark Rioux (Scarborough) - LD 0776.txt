Dear Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee 
on Judiciary, my name is Mark Rioux and I am a resident of Scarborough. l am submitting this testimony 
in opposition to LD 1619. 
I have the following reasons for my opposition: 
1. Abortion is a crime against God. While all of us must comply with the laws of our community, the 
Laws of God supercede and man-made law and it is our Christian responsibility to speak out 
against this abomination LD 1619. 
2. At the time of the Roe v Wade decision in 1973, the supporters repeatedly had mentioned that 
they wanted abortions to be safe, legal and rare. History has shown none of these are true, at 
least where the Federal Government is concerned. Since the decision in 1973, over 63 million 
lives have been aborted just here in the US. By some accounts, over 40% of the Black population 
has been eradicated by abortion as a result of the ruling. This is nothing short of genocide. 
3. LD 1619 would legally allow a baby that could survive outside the womb to be killed. People 
today have become numb against the frequent stories in the news regarding mass shootings and 
yet this bill would result in similar meaningless taking of human life. 
4. Finally, l will close with the commandment that Jesus himself gave us from Matthew 22:39— 
“You Shall Love Your Neighbor as Yourself" 
I ask that you respectfully consider the points l have raised regarding this bill and not allow this to 
become law. Each one of us will face God on the last day and will be asked to account for the decisions 
and actions we took in our lives. 
l apologize as l am not able to testify directly before this committee today but I have submitted my 
testimony to my sister, Jean Hall of Buxton, and asked her to present in person in my place. 
Sincerely, 
r- 
, 
an
