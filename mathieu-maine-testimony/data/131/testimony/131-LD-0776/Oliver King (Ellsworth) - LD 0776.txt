Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Oliver King,, and l am a resident of Ellsworth, Maine. 
Thank you for allowing me a moment to speak. l would like to ask you a few questions. When a person is 
an inconvenience, do we kill them? Even in the case of something as horrible as rape, what part did the 
child in the womb play in that horrible crime that deserves death? 
Many of you silence your conscience's, convincing yourselves it's okay because they arenâ€™t even 
human. So the important question is, when does the child in the womb become human? 
Please consider, this is about more than the children. We all must give an account before God for 
everything we do, including how we vote. l leave you with this, the only hope for us all is Jesus Christ, 
and His atoning sacrifice and resurrection. l urge everyone to repent and turn to Him. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
