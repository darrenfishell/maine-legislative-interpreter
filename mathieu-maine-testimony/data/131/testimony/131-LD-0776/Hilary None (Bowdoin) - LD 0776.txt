"Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Hilary, I ama 
resident of Bowdoin. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619.” 
Public speaking has never been a strength of mine but as a mother of4 
beautiful children whose unique personalities have so much to offer 
this world, I no longer have the choice to be silent as we are called to: 
”Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves to ensure justice 
for those being crushed. Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless, and 
see that they get justice. Proverbs 31:8-9 
And with this bill I believe there is a great injustice being done toa 
whole generation who will never be able to speak up for themselves 
and leave their mark in this world. 
I believe President Ronald Reagan said it well: ”We cannot diminish the 
value of one category of human life—-the unborn—without diminishing 
the value of all human life." 
And that is why I urge you to vote Ought Not to Pass on LD 1619 and 
restore value to ALL human life!!! 
Thank You, 
Hilary
