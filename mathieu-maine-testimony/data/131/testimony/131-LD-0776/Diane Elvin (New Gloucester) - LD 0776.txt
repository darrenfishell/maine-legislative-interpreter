Madame/ Mister Chair & Honorable lvlembers of the Judiciary 
Committee, 
My name is Diane Elvin and I live in New Gloucester. I am 
the mother of 4 grown children and the grandmother of 13. 
As a follower oflesus Christ, I believe that life begins at 
conception and I have been blessed to see several ultrasounds 
of my grandchildren. The technology of today allows us to see 
with such detail the forming of the life within the womb. I was 
always amazed at how ALIVE and perfect these children were 
with all the kicking, sucking of thumbs, etc. 
There are many people in America that would love to 
adopt a child, but it seems that it is near impossible to do that 
unless you go to a foreign country. If LD1619 would allow for 
abortion up to the point of giving birth, why not allow the birth 
to happen, saving a life, and give the children to someone that 
wants them. This seems like common sense to me! 
So, in closing, I would like to ask you all to vote NO on this 
LD1619 Abortion Bill! 
Thank you.
