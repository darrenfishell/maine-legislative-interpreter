Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Ken Dockendorff, and I'm a resident of Dixmont. l’m here to testify in opposition to LD 
1619. 
Sixty-four years ago my Mother gave birth to my half sister Gail who has down-syndrome. 
My Mother was told by her husband and doctors, to give my sister up as she would not live past 
her teenage years. 
My Mother did the right thing and left a good life as the wife of a Naval Officer and kept her 
daughter, whom she still cares for to this day. 
Even with today‘s technology, where you can know everything about the unborn child, my Mother 
would tell you she would still keep the child. Eliminating a child's life is not an option. 
There are plenty of people who will love a child whom others deem unwanted. 
My Mother did the right thing sixty-four years ago and it is my hope that you will do the right thing 
and vote against bill LD1619. 
Please vote ought not to pass
