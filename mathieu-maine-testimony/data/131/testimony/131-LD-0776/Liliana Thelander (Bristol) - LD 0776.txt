Dear Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Judiciary 
Committee: 
My name is Liliana Thelander from Bristol. 
I strongly oppose Bill LD 1619 because, the effect of this bill is to legalize infanticide. The 
proposed law does not require any justiﬁcation to terminate a nine-month pregnancy. LD 1619 
allows the execution of a person merely for being dependent upon another for her or his needs. 
A law that allows dependent people to be legally executed justiﬁes legal euthanasia of the 
incapacitated — the elderly, the disabled, and others. 
Usually when a criminal gets the death sentence it is because the crime requires that punishment, 
but a baby is an innocent human being. Why is the mother allowed to kill her baby? 
This bill will also kill the soul of society. It will say to the world "life has no value and anyone 
who inconveniences someone may be erased, murdered, killed" . The blood will be on the hands 
of all who supports this demonic bill. 
My ﬁrst instinct was to plea to your conscience and for the rights of the unborn, but nowI 
understand that we need to pray for Gov. Mills‘ soul and the souls of the members of this 
committee because when make your decision you need to be able to face God as the judge of 
your actions with a clear conscience. When you make your decision have you really thought 
about when life begins? The baby will ﬁght to stay alive when the doctor tries to terminate it if 
you vote to give him permission to do so. The baby will feel pain and the heart rate will increase 
as this child ﬁghts to stay alive. If the doctor does something to dampen the pain, he is only 
admitting that this is life that will ﬁght for the right to live. Do you really think killing the baby 
inside or outside the womb creates a distinction between murder and a medical procedure? These 
babies are alive, please vote to let them live.I 
This bill LD 1619 ought not to pass.
