Senator Carney and representative Moonen, honorable members of the joint standing 
committee on the judiciary, my name is Joshua La Grange and I am a resident of Veazie 
I am here in opposition, to LD1619. 
I am a 17 year old, who is unable to understand how someone does not value a life, 
many people seem to believe that a fetus is not living yet “doesn’t count” but if that is the 
case, then why, if a pregnant lady is killed it‘s counted as a double homicide, when did 
we decide to play God and pick and choose when a life has value or not based on 
convenience. 
Now l’m sure there are many different reasons someone would want to get an abortion, 
but one of the most common l’ve experienced is, when someone proposes the rape 
argument, can I not say that we've all learned that two wrongs do not make a right, one 
terrible deed does notjustify the termination of a life. 
As the leaders of our nation I hope you choose to pave my future on the love of life and 
not the convenience of death. 
Thank you.
