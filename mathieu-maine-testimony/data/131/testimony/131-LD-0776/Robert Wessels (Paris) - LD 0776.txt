Honorable Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Robert 
Wessels and I am a resident of Paris. l am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619." 
For years the pro-choice argument has focused on making a big deal that it is a “fetus" and 
not a baby in the first trimester. We have been repeating this lie long enough that there are 
many that believe it. lf you are one of those, l won't successfully convince you otherwise in my 
3 minutes, but I will ask you, what has changed? Maine has had an abortion law that has made 
our pro-choice delegates happy enough. What happened? Why do we need to move beyond 
terminating a so-called “fetus” to now legalize terminating the life of what everybody must agree 
is an actual baby? LD 1619 includes any baby up until they are born. This is a radical and 
extreme bill, even for the most devout pro-choicer. This is clearly murder and there is no other 
way to look at it. To confirm this, I was researching and found a survey that an NPR article 
published. I also found a separate survey that was done by Archbalt.org...both sun/eys came to 
the same conclusion. Both sun/eys found that almost 70% of the people surveyed are against 
abortions being done outside of the first trimester. This is not a democrat issue, this is nota 
republican issue. Do not make the mistake of “voting along party lines." This is quite literally a 
life and death issue, and this survey is showing that the American people do not support state- 
sanctioned murder in the United States. You don't need to mess with the current law, so please 
don't. 
One last reason to vote down LD 1619 is because this is a slippery slope. As proven by 
your desire to go from 13‘ trimester to "anytime ” ...the desire for more will never end. Once this 
is approved, what is next? Will we follow Canada into doctor assisted suicides? Will we follow 
previous civilizations into state-sanctioned euthanasia of our elderly? Or our disabled? Once 
you gain a numbness to death and start devaluing human life, these are not far-fetched 
outcomes. Maybe you and l will be elderly by the time that euthanasia starts...it ’s not 
unrealistic. 
l plead with each of you, you have an amazing opportunity to stop the slippery slope now! 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
For Maine, 
Robert Wessels
