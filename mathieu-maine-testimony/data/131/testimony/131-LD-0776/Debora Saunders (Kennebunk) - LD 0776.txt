Augusta, ME 04330 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen and Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Debora Saunders, I am a resident of Kennebunk. I am here today to takea 
stand against LD1619. It is written as An act to improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws, 
however, this bill goes far beyond privacy laws. In the state of Maine we already have an 
abortion bill that allows the life of little humans to be taken up to 24 weeks. This bill would 
amend this current law, allowing a viable human life to be aborted after 24 weeks up to birth for 
any reason. How is this an improvement? 
The irony is that the state of Maine has shot down capital punishment several times for 
the fear of executing an innocent human.1 Yet this bill would end the life of humans who truly 
are completely innocent. 
I am standing here to be a voice for the unborn little humans, whose voices are not able to 
be heard. I am speaking on behalf of the babies because I believe that these little humans would 
be speaking up and crying out for a chance to live. 
Why are they called babies when they are wanted, but fetuses when they are unwanted? 
This dehumanized them. You have a choice today, to bring life or death sentences to potentially 
thousands of fully viable babies. I am asking you to please think about these little babies who 
have feelings and see them as they are, Human. 
I thank you for your valuable time and for your courage in voting ought not to pass. 
Maine Resident, 
Debora Saunders
