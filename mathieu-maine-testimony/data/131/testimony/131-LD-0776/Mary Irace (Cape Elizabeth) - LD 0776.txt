Honorable members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Mary lrace and lam a resident of Cape Elizabeth. 
I have lived in Maine all my life and have never once travelled to Augusta to 
appear to talk about a proposed law, but when i heard of the provisions of the 
proposed law, LD 1619, was so shocked that I felt compelled to come here and 
speak out in opposition to it. 
lt is my understanding that this law would permit abortions at any time prior to 
birth if the abortion is deemed "necessary" by a physician. Necessary is not 
defined and it's pretty clear necessary can be interpreted broadly as ‚Äùfor any 
reason". 
The current law as it exists today only allows for unrestricted abortion prior to 
viability and thereafter only to preserve the life or health of the mother. 
The present law, while l still strongly disagree with it, was adopted, in my view, 
because it was somewhat debatable as to when a developing fetus was 
developed enough to be considered a person having rights and entitled to 
protection under the law. 
There can be no such good faith argument advanced under the proposed law, 
which suggests that a fully developed unborn baby only hours or minutes from 
birth, is somehow not a separate person, and is little more than an appendix. To 
promote such an idea is disingenuous in the least, and in my view immoral and 
barbaric, in that it legitimizes infanticide.~ 
l strongly urge rejection of this proposed law, for this reason but also for your 
own sakes, since I believe future generations will look upon anyone who 
supported this law with the same distain as those who supported slavery, who 
considering African slaves less than human. What's worse, this law can deprive 
persons not just of freedom, but of life itself. 
Please vote ought not to pass. 
Thank you. 
Mary lrace
