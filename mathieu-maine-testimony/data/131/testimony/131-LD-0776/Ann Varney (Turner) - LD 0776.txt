LD 1619 TESTIMONY 
Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Ann Varney and I ama 
resident of Turner. I am here to testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
In 1975, I became an unwed mother. I was 22 years old, when my 
daughter was born. I found motherhood to be the biggest challenge I had 
ever had. I didn’t have family support and I worked full time. She turned 
out to be the biggest blessing that I had ever received. I can’t lie, it was at 
times, frustrating and stressful. On the other hand, she filled me with a love 
that I had never experienced. I wasn’t a perfect mom, but she became an 
amazing young woman. She received a Doctorate from the University of 
Stirling in Scotland and went to work for the University of Oxford. She was 
co-founder and Program Director of one of the most popular special needs 
day camps, called Farm Ability, in Wytham, England. The day camp 
taught life and farm skills to the attendees, who helped plant and weed 
gardens, feed animals, gather chicken eggs, and sell them at a farmers’ 
market. She was an expert in chickens and was writing a book that was 
going to be published in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. 
Without Corri, there may not have been a Farm Ability. She died of cancer 
in 2014, but I had the good fortune to have her as my daughter and best 
friend for almost 38 yrs.
