Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Peter Wannemacher, and I am a resident of Farmington, Maine. 
Thank you for this opportunity to address the proposed bill LD 1619. 
I have been a resident of Maine for more than thirty years. My wife and I raised 6 children here 
and 14 of our 19 grandchildren still live and work in the state. We currently reside in Farmington 
I urge you not to pass LD 1619. In reading it, I observe that medical necessity is already 
covered by existing law. I see that it removes all concern for the life of the child. 
The children who are affected by the changes in legislation are defined as those who could 
survive were it not for this procedure. The State of Maine permits no other circumstance in 
which, aside from saving or defending life, anyone may legally take the life of anyone else. 
Why are these tiniest of humans the only ones ineligible to this most basic legal protection? 
I think the children, mothers, and fathers of Maine deserve better.
