Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and other members of the Judiciary Committee 
My name is Gregory Foster. lam a resident of the town of Raymond, and I am here to speak in 
opposition to L.D. 1619. 
l believe life begins at conception, that a fetus is its own body with its own DNA and should be 
protected. l believe this bill and the general attitude toward women's "reproductive rights" (which do 
not and never existed as rights) excludes the father from the decision to abort the child. I also believe if 
abortion was not used as birth control, we would not be here today. 
Taking the life of an unborn child during any time during a pregnancy is a horrible thing. It is far more 
palatable to leave the law as is, than to legally be able to kill the child up to birth. 
l also believe the legislature's goal regarding abortion should focus on changing the hearts and mind of 
people. Suggestions of how to do that include simpler and less expensive adoption rules and good 
quality council for woman contemplating abortion. 
I urge you to vote ought not to pass on LD 1619, and any other bill that further enhances the ability ofa 
women to abort their child.
