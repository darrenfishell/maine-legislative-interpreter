Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Scott Terry, a resident of the Town of Scarborough. And I’m here to testify in 
opposition to LDl 619. 
I want to share from my heart what I think all Mainers believe, which is that it is wrong to 
intentionally kill an innocent human being. And, what I think, not all, but most Mainers believe, 
which is that abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being. And therefore 
abortion is wrong. 
But, as the exigencies of life become more complex, and human interactions become 
increasingly complicated, elected representatives, like yourselves, must make difficult decisions. 
Decisions like legalizing abortion, which most consider a harm, in order to represent others who 
consider abortion a way of avoiding a harm. 
As a result, Maine’s current laws which legalize abortion position us alongside other states with 
the most liberal laws on abortion. The already existing standard being up to the point of the 
baby’s viability. LDl6l9 would move that standard to the very same minute in which that 
baby’s ﬁrst cry would be heard. That is by any objective measure, an extreme standard. 
Your job is to enact legislation that brings about an intended and preferred outcome for the 
people of Maine. What is the preferred outcome of such a law‘? Is it your intention to reduce the 
population of the state of Maine? Surely not. Is it your intention to increase the median age of 
the population of the good old state of Maine? Surely not. Is it your intention to amend the 
slogan of the state of Maine to say, “Maine, the way death should be?” Surely not. And yet, 
those are the logical, expected outcomes of this bill LDl6l9. 
We want more Maine people, more Maine babies, more life in the state of Maine. Please act in 
opposition to LDl6l9. Thank you for hearing me.
