LD 776 
 
Members of the Committee on Judiciary, this is testimony AGAINST LD 776.  
While I agree with what its language seems to say on the surface, I believe that said language in 
LD 776 is deeply flawed. The phrase “bodily autonomy” is not defined and is broad enough to 
cover many areas that are probably not intended. The broadness of language would spread 
confusion and contradictions all through the areas of law, public health, social policy and others.  
Please don’t let this bill pass. Thank you.
