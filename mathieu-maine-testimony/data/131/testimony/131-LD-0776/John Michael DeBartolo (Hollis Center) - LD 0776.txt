Madam/Mr. Chairperson and honorable members of the Judiciary Committee 
My name is JohnMichae| DeBartolo and I live in Hollis Center ME. I am a great-grandparent, grandparent, 
parent, son and sibling. I am testifying today in opposition of LD 1619, An Act to Improve Maineâ€™s 
Reproductive Privacy Laws 
To begin with, this law is not an improvement. As a person of faith in God I believe that abortion is 
gravely contrary to the moral law and that civil laws must protect human life from the moment of 
conception. 
The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation 
ought to accord them, the state is denying the equality of all before the law. 
This is an extreme bill which will allow abortion up to birth. Please oppose this unnecessary, drastic bill 
that a majority of Mainers do not want to see passed, thank you.
