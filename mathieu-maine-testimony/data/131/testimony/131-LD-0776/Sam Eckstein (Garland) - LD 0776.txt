Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Committee Members, 
My name is Sam Eckstein, and I live in Garland, Maine. I oppose LDl6l9. 
Hello, my name is Sam and I have a chromosomal disorder. If my family believed in abortion, I might not 
be here today. I believe that all life is important and I am thankful my parents believed that too. 
Please vote ought not to pass.
