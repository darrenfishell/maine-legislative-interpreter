Choose life- 
Lawmakers and leaders among us, 
my name is Nathan Rockafellow. I'm a resident of Eliot Maine. I appreciate what you do and am 
greatful that my voice can be a part of this process. l'm here to testify in opposition to LD1619. 
People use laws as a means to an end- a way to safeguard peace and pleasure, a future. 
But laws come and laws go. Civilization do the same. l applaud the lawmakers among us for doing 
their best to safeguard peace and pleasure, our future. “Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," 
in that order. 
l humbly offer this ancient advice as you make weighty decisions. A wisdom passed on from God to 
creation. It's recorded in the book of Deuteronomy. Here are those words: 
“l call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, 
blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live." Deuteronomy 
30119. 
That ancient audience has long since passed and their society with its laws are no more. But we are 
here. Now we decide how we will live. By our own design or by the Designer's plan. We're all 
accountable to this same choice- life or death. 
l beg you, our lawmakers to protect life at all stages and ages. “Choose life that we and our 
offspring may live" . Oppose any law that may take it. Oppose LD1619. 
Heaven and earth will bear witness to the choices we make.
