Tes�mony in Opposi�on to LD 1619 An Act to Improve M aine ’s Reproduc�ve Privacy Laws  
My name is Joyce Thebar ge. I am 73 years old, and I have some  thoughts  to share on the 
upcoming di scussion regarding LD 1619  An Act to Im prove Ma ine’s Reproduc�ve Privacy Laws  and the 
other pendi ng bills to expand abor�on in our State . 
This is a personal tes�mony for me unfortunately,  but it does give me a reason to share on 
behalf of other wom en and children yet  to be b orn.  I have  experienced both  an abor�on and a 
miscarriage .  You might wonder  why I am  bringing miscarriage in to my l eter.  It is because they both  
involve a mother , a baby , and a death .  I also want to talk about  the women —young and old—even 
women  in their  last years.   
At 23 I had an abor�on .  I knew I was carrying a baby —a baby whose eyes and hair color and all 
unique traits already established.  But because of shame and guilt, I c hose the path  to keep my 
pregna ncy secret an d end my baby ’s life .  That  decision pers onally brou ght me pain , grief,  and regret that  
I was not an�cipa�ng .  I will share  that a�er many years of anguish, guilt, and shame, I did ﬁnd 
forgiveness in Jesus’ sacriﬁce and forgiveness and  found grace to forgive myself.  
A decade later,  I was 32 years old —married and very much desiring to be a mother .  I was happy, 
telling everyo ne the wonderful news,  and then I started “ spo�ng ”.  I did not think anything was really 
wrong.  I went to my doctor and had  an ultrasound  at 24 weeks into the pregnancy .  Our baby had died 
in the womb,  and I had to deliver my baby.  Thankf ully, we had a very kind doctor who  sat with us much 
of the �me un�l our baby was born —very much looking lik e a baby.   This was a huge disappointment 
and loss for me and my husband.  We receive d much love and sympathy f rom our  fami ly and friends a t 
the �me.  
Thankfully, I worked where other women had also e xperienced the pain and loss of miscarriage.  
They understood  and provided a lis tening ear and comfort that other family, friends, and even my 
husband could not provide.  Thankfully, I ca n say God allowed me to have three beau�ful and loving 
daughter s—all grown and they have giv en us ﬁve beau�ful grandchildren  that we tr easure. 
  Here is where I would like  to say that I suspect that most people who choose an abor�on never 
experience the love,  sympathy , and understanding t hey may nee d right a�er the abo r�on or maybe 5, 
10, 30, or even 50 years later .  Our culture has come to a place to focus on “the right  to have an 
abor�on ” over the desire to help and care for the youn g or older woman facing a diﬃ cult and probably 
frightening �me in her life.  Is that what you want for the women of our  State? This law will not just 
aﬀect wo men wan�ng an abor �on.  You are  making la ws that aﬀect all of us.  Even men have to deal with 
guilt and sorrow about their decisions  involving  abor�ons .   
The truth (though not easy or convenient) is that there are healthy , life – giving op�on s for 
everyone .  There is help for those in an un�mely pregnancy.  There are s�ll many people desiring to 
adopt babies —even babies with health problems.  Having helped in these situa�ons in the past, I found 
that once the ini�al shock, fears , and unknowns are faced and lived with for a �me, the  child becam e a 
gi� that was treasured, and their birth joyfully an�cipated.  I know this wasn’t easy for them, but it was 
life changing in wonderful ways.  I am not naive to the fact that paren�ng is not easy —especially in those 
early years.  The young girls  and all women deﬁ nitely need support and help to do this,  but we all need 
help in this life when we face challenges.   
I felt to share this tes�mony of why I believe  LD 1619 will not improve things for women or 
children.   It is described as a law to help women.   I see this proposed law to allow abor�on right up to 
the �me of birth  bringing even more pain and devasta�on  to many more women than is already 
happ ening.  This law , as I read it, will allow  abor�on t o be done in a w ay that women  and their husband s 
or boyf riends making  decision s in a perceived cr isis will end the life of a precious child with so much 
poten�al and love to give.  Yes, all lives do mater —even those w e can’t see yet. 
My plea  for each of you is to stop for a few  minutes  to read these words and then think about what you 
are vo�ng on here.  I am asking you to reﬂect on your own life : 
1. You were allowed to  be born  and have a life --not necessarily easy for your mother/father .  Maybe 
life has been hard,  but you are  thankfully  alive . 
2. You or someone you love ha s experienced a miscarriage or had an abor�on.  I bring my story to say 
that if you love and care about a wom an in yo ur life and even children (babie s), plea se have th e 
courage to stand as a leader in our State to suppo rt life —mother and baby.  
I am trying to emphasi ze that this” quick  ﬁx” for an unwanted pregnancy  is not the answer for the 
wom an, man , or baby.  Personally, I have met man y women who have chosen this procedure.  There are 
some my age and younger that would  say it was  the right decision and would not acknowledge the 
impact this decision has  had on their life.  But I hav e met more people  that have sh ared their own pain, 
regret and sorrow.  Two precious women come to m ind as I write this .  I met two women —one 88 and 
one 89.  I shared with each of them my abor�on experience,  not expec�ng this  response from either 
lady.  One to ld me she had polio and  doctors  strongly advised her to abort  the baby for her health.  But 
here she was telling me how much this grieved and bothered her all her life .  Then the other lady I was 
caring for told me that many years  ago she too had an abo r�on and was so very grieved.  I n addi�on to 
her own experience, one of her daughters had an abor�on and later took her life.    
I tell you the se sad stories just to help you realize this could  be your mother, grandmo ther,  wife,  
aunt, sister, daughter , niece  or friend .  True l ove and compassion come  along side someone in a diﬃcult 
situa�on .  They  do not promot e something that will hurt wo men  for the rest of their lives .   I truly tha nk 
you for taking the �me to read and consider my thoughts.  
Sincerely,
