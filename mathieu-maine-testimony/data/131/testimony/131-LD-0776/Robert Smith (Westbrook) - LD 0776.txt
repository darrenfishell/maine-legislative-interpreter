LD 776
I wish to express my opposition to LD 776.  It is not necessary to amend the Maine 
Constitution to establish a Right to Bodily Autonomy.  As to the linkage to the 
question of abortion, it would make sense that the sponsors of this bill should 
specifically include the unborn as being worthy of the protection of their bodily 
autonomy.  Keep in mind that the First Right mentioned in the Declaration of 
Independence, a founding document of these United States, a Declaration made July 
4, 1776 which  proclaims in paragraph two that we" are endowed by our Creator with 
certain Unalienable Rights,", the first being "LIFE."  It is worth pondering if the 
proposed Right of Bodily Autonomy would apply to the unborn and would it protect 
them from the certain harm of abortion.  It should. It is a matter of Life VS Death.
