Abortion is not a single person issue. Life begins at conception, this is confirmed by science. The 
impact of a single abortion has dire and drastic consequences. Please hear my husband's 
testimony. 
One day about 6years ago before he and l met, my husband had a one night stand with an addict. 
A child was conceived from that encounter and my husband knew the unborn baby was his. From 
that came a purpose for him and he wanted to be the best father he could. He quit smoking, 
drinking and doing drugs and started following the Lord Jesus Christ. The woman didn't believe 
that the child was his and didn't want to change and would take him to prenatal appointments 
and seriously discuss abortion options with the physician. As a man my husband had no say in 
whether his child lived or died. He begged and pleaded for his daughter's life and the mother 
finally relented. If that woman had chosen to destroy life, my husband wouldn't have changed, I 
would never have met my wonderful husband (and if I did, we probably wouldn't have liked each 
other) and my beautifu, brilliant daughter. I gladly claim her as my own and we are very blessed 
by God. Abortions not only kill the unborn and traumatize women, it has a disasterous ripple 
effect on everyone. We must be prolife and profanity. Please vote against this radical Bill that 
allows for the greatest genocide of our time
