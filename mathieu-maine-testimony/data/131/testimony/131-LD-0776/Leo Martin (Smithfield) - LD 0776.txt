Statement by 
Leo Martin 
To Members of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary 
Regarding 
LD 1619 An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
May 1, 2023 
Sen. Carney, Rep. Moonen, and members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to present before you. I am Leo Martin, a taxpayer and citizen of Smithfield, Maine. 
lam opposed to LD 1619. 
lfind it contradictory that the Legislature responsible for decimating the lobster industry to SAVE THE 
RiGHT WHALES (NOAA data 9 mortalities world-wide in the last 5 years due to entanglement), is 
evaluating the abortion/murder of viable human beings (Maine.gov data averaging over 2,000 abortions 
per year). 
Approving this bill would be enabling interference with the God given ”Miracle of Life". 
Luke 17:2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and thrown into the sea, 
than that he should offend one of these little ones. 
if either of our parents had chosen abortion — with whom would this discussion take place? 
I urge this committee to vote this heinous L.D. 1619 "ought not to pass."
