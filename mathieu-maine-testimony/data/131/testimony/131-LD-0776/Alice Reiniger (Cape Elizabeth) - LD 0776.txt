This message originates from outside the Maine Legislature.' 
Dear Clerk Pinette,' 
Would you please distribute my opposition testimony to the Judiciary Committee when LD 1619, 
dishonestly titled "An Act to Improve Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws," comes on for hearing? 
We adopted our two sons at birth from a young woman who was brave enough to stand up to forces 
urging her to seek an abortion, as it would be "better for even/one" and she wouldn't even have to 
have her parent's permission, even though she was a minor. Now our boys are 16 and 17 years old 
and we will be forever grateful to their birch mother for bringing both babies to term, delivering 
them, and answering our prayers at the same time. I don't think anyone would say that it would 
have been "better" for our sons if she had terminated their pregnancies. 
It is hideous to think that Maine could be a state where a fetus can be killed right up until birth 
without a medical necessity. That has got to be considered murder as the baby obviously could. 
sun/ive as we have just seen with a 22-week-old! There are so many people desperate to be parents 
that surely we can work to promote life and family, not destroy it. 
Thank you for allowing my voice to be heard. 
Sincerely, 
Alice Reiniger
