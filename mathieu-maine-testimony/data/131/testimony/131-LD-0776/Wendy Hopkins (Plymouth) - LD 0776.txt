I am writing to urge you to vote "ought not to pass" for LD 1619._ 
Besides the fact that abortion at any stage is the taking of a life, the proposed changes are moving Maine even further away from a "safe and rare" situation. 
It is in NO way safe, emotionally or physically, for the mother to abort a baby up to full term. And I do not understand how anyone can say that killing a viable infant is anything but murder. 
Removing "to preserve the life or health of the mother" is further proof that this is NOT about health or safety. 
Removing any penalties for a non-licensed person who knowingly performs or assists in an abortion is akin to saying anyone can perform one without risk of repercussions. What is the point of saying someone has to be licensed to kill a baby if there is 
no penalty for them if they are not? 
Again, l strongly urge you to vote "ought not to pass" for LD 1619 
Thank you for your time! 
Sincerely, 
Wendy Hopkins
