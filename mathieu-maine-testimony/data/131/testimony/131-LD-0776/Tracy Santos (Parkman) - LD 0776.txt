Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and Honorable Members of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary: 
My name is Tracy Santos, and l’m a resident of Parkman. I'm here to 
testify in opposition to LD 1619. 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. 
in thinking about the possibilities connected with the proposed legislation 
of LD 1619, l decided to have a close look at the Constitution of the State of 
Maine. What I found in Section 1 of the Declaration of Rights is, “All people are 
born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and 
unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and 
liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and obtaining safety and 
happiness. ” 
l’m very thankful to be here today to defend life as is my natural right under 
this constitution. l‘m afraid, however, that this proposed legislation, which would 
remove ALL restrictions on abortion up until birth, flies in the face of our own 
state constitution. As was quoted, we are a people who enjoy and DEFEND life. 
ln no way is snuffing out the life of a baby at full term in line with enjoying or 
defending life. 
l believe the majority of Maine’s citizens prefer to uphold these positive 
words from our current constitution but dread to think of how a new one might be 
worded if LD 1619 and other proposed legislation like it were to become law in 
our state. 
For the best future for the citizens of Maine, l’m asking you to please vote 
“ought not to pass” on LD 1619. 
Thank you for your consideration of these comments, 
Tracy Santos
