Senator Carney and Representative Moonen, Honorable Members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Judiciary 
My name is Alana Pineo, and I am a resident of Hampden. I am here to testify in 
opposition to LD 1619. 
I am 15 years old, and I in part, represent the group of people abortion advocates say 
they're trying to protect by allowing these extreme and unnecessary laws. 
I cannot speak for all girls my age, but I do understand that my actions have 
consequences. As a 15 year old, I realize that an unborn babies’ life is a life. And I also 
know that I can rise up from challenges that life throws at me. 
Teen girls like me do not need to be protected by more abortion laws. We need to 
protect those who cannot speak up for themselves - the unborn babies. Maine’s current 
laws are already extreme but LD 1619 would take it to another level. 
Please vote ought not to pass LD 1619.
