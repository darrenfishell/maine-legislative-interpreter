Good afiernoon, Senalor Carney and Represenialive lvloonen, Honorable 
Members of The Joini Sianding Commiilee on Judiciary. Thank you for your 
service. 
My name is Danielle Haggeriy, and l am a residenf of Hermon. I am here lo 
leslify in opposiiion lo LD iél‘? as This bill would allow viable babies io be 
aborled up uniil birih. 
As a molher of 4 and a grandmolher lo a beauliful 3-year-old granddaughler 
who was born when our daughler was T6 years old, my hearl breaks for moms 
considering aboriion. No person considers ending a life unless ihey feel 
hopeless. 
As an elecled official in Hermon, lwas challenged by a resideni saying ihail 
should nol casl my voles based on my beliefs. lvly beliefs are my moral fabric, 
people elecled me because of my characier. This is exacily how elecled 
officials should vole, our founding falhers voied as lhey believed. 
Some of you are silling here knowing ihal you or your signiflcanl olher would 
never aborl a viable baby and 65% of lvlainers agree wlih you. You are being 
pressured lo compromise your moral fabric lo follow pariy lines. l believe lhe 
majorily of people who voied for you, would never, in lheir vvildesl dreams, lhink 
you would vole for someihing as heinous as aboriing a viable baby. Please do 
nol lei ihem down by caving lo pressure in Augusia. 
Please oppose This unnecessary, drasiic bill. Thank you.
