LD776 RESOLUTION' Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine to 
Establish the Right to Bodily Autonomy   LINDA HASKELL, opposition to LD776   
There is absolutely "NO NEED  for this RESOLUTION TO BE ENACTED". This 
State of Maine and the USA are in dire straits for a responsible government , which is 
not what we have in this present lifetime. We are the gift of God and the Word of God
is the path of righteousness. The act to deform ones physical body is a form of mental 
illness.
LINDA HASKELL, Testimony to oppose.
