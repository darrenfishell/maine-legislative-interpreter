Senator Carney and Representative Mooran, Honorable Members of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary, my name is Alice Merritt, 
and I am a resident of Porter. l I am here to testify in opposition to 
LD1619. 
As a woman who has lived forty-nine years with the mental anguish of 
having had an abortion of an embwo of six weeksâ€˜ gestation, l find the 
concept of LD1619 to be abhorrent. This bill would allow a baby that 
could actually survive outside the womb to be killed. l cannot even 
begin to imagine the long-term psychological scarring this would impart 
to those women who might take part in this offering. 
l sincerely believe in live and let live, but if this bill passes, Maine will 
possess one of the most extreme abortion laws in the entire country. 
As a Registered Nurse of more than twenty-two years, l am painfully 
aware of the lack of availability of mental health services within the 
state of Maine. As a survivor of guilt and shame, I know the addictions l 
have lived with and faced as I attempted to drown my sorrow for the 
prior actions of having taken the lifeforce of my own child to be. Asa 
taxpayer of Maine for the past forty-five years, l resent the undue 
burden this will bring against our great state. As medical necessity is 
already covered by the current law within our state, I implore this 
judiciary panel to vote down this bill labeled LD1619.
