LD1619 
TITLE: An Act to lmprove Maine's Reproductive Privacy Laws 
Position: OPPOSE 
Senator Carney, Representative Moonen, and members of the 
Judiciary Committee: 
My name is Christine Webber, from Kennebunk, ME. l come 
before you today to speak in opposition of LD 1619 
l have 4 adult children, 9 grandchildren and 1 great granddaughter. 
l lost my first daughter, because she was born premature 10 weeks early. She 
lived 3 hours. My husband and l never got to see or hold our daughter. This 
was a great sorrow for us and continues to be. 
Each life is precious. Each child has a unique personality, and special God 
given gifts. The LD 1619 bill would allow physicians to conduct an abortion at 
any time during a pregnancy. This bill terminates these precious beautiful 
children, not allowing them their right to live. Please recall in your own lives the 
people you know and love. Each of us here did receive the gift of life. 
Please let all babies have this precious God given gift of life. 
ln conclusion, 
l ask the committee to vote NO on LD 1619. Thank youl 
Christine A, Webber
