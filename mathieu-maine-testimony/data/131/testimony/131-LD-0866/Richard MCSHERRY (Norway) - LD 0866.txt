I am a member of local committees focused on historic preservation and economic 
viability of our downtown. Our town has some requirements regarding signage but 
people have shied away from dealing with so-called temporary signs placed on 
roadsides due to a perception that it is a 'State issue'. There is confusion around how 
existing rules are enforced and who does it, resulting in kind of a 'wild-west' scenario 
of visual clutter that ignores the few guidelines that do exist. If I understand the intent 
of this proposed modification to existing statutory language, responsibility for 
regulating temporary signage would pass to communities who elect to assume the 
responsibility through the adoption of local standards. This welcome expansion of 
local control would enable town governments and citizens to proactively manage the 
dueling interests of free-speech, commerce, politics, and roadway safety and 
aesthetics. I urge your support of this change.
