Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
the
distinguished
members
of
the
Committee
on
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nick
Murray
and
I
serve
as
director
of
policy
for
Maine
Policy
Institute.
We
are
a
free
market
think
tank,
a
nonpartisan,
non-profit
organization
that
advocates
for
individual
liberty
and
economic
freedom
in
Maine.
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
testify
in
support
of
LDs
1231,
1434,
1638,
1651,
and
1671
.
As
you
weigh
these
proposals,
keep
this
in
mind:
Maine
imposes
the
highest
tax
rate
on
income
made
up
to
$100,000
for
a
single
filer
than
any
other
state
in
New
England.
That
undoubtedly
makes
the
state
less
attractive
to
prospective
citizens
in
comparison
to
other
states.
At
some
point,
we
must
come
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
our
economic
policies
are
actively
pushing
away
workers
and
entrepreneurs.
Combined
with
some
of
the
highest
energy
costs
in
the
nation
and
an
aging
population,
several
states
offer
a
more
affordable
landing
pad
for
young
families
and
start-ups
than
Maine
does.
This
is
the
economic
reality
facing
our
state.
In
even
the
most
generous
state
rankings
on
economic
health
and
competitiveness,
Maine
places
in
the
bottom
10.
1
The
cost
of
doing
business
here
is
9%
higher
than
the
national
average;
the
cost
of
living
is
15%
higher.
2
Any
of
these
bills
would
improve
our
relative
economic
situation,
but
LD
1434,
to
abolish
the
income
tax
entirely,
would
provide
the
greatest
boost
to
Mainers
and
help
attract
much-needed
workers
to
the
state.
Recently
inflated
General
Fund
revenues
are
Mainers’
rightful
earnings.
Why
does
the
state
get
to
benefit
while
the
people
are
getting
fleeced
by
inflation?
The
rainy
day
fund
has
hit
its
statutory
maximum.
Mainers
need
and
deserve
a
permanent
tax
cut.

There
may
be
no
truer
adage
in
economics
than,
“when
you
tax
something,
you
get
less
of
it.”
The
income
tax
is
truly
unlike
any
other
tax–it
disincentivizes
work
and
saps
the
value
people
create
for
others.
It
is
the
price
we
pay
for
being
uncivilized.
Think
of
how
dehumanizing
it
is
to
have
the
fruits
of
one’s
labor
taken
before
even
being
able
to
account
for
it.
The
state
should
promote
earnings
instead
of
taxing
them.
Please
deem
LDs
1231,
1434,
1638,
1651,
and
1671
“Ought
To
Pass”
and
work
to
build
a
tax
policy
environment
that
promotes
growth
instead
of
stagnation.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
