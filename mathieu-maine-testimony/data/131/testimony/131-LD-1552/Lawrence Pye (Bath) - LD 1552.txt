LD 1552
Chairman and Members of the Joint Standing Marine Resources Committee,
I am writing to testify in favor of LD 1552, "An Act to Create the Lobster Innovation 
Fund." 
The Lobster Innovation Fund will serve as a critical tool in promoting the 
participation of harvesters in experimental gear trials. As we all know, the lobster 
fishery is a vital industry for the State of Maine, providing jobs and economic 
opportunities for countless Mainers. It is also an industry that faces challenges, 
including potential regulatory changes at the federal level.
To address these challenges, it is critical that we invest in innovative approaches to 
sustainably manage the lobster fishery. One key way to achieve this goal is through 
experimental gear trials, which allow harvesters to test new gear and practices in 
real-world conditions. However, it can be difficult to get enough participation from 
harvesters to make these trials truly successful.
The Lobster Innovation Fund will provide financial incentives for harvesters to 
participate in these trials, which will increase the chances of success for new 
innovations. By fostering collaboration between harvesters, scientists, and other 
stakeholders, the fund will help to ensure that new gear and practices are field-tested 
and workable by the industry. This will ultimately lead to a more sustainable lobster 
fishery for future generations, and help to avoid potentially draconian federal 
regulations that might not be suitable for Maine's lobster fishery.
In conclusion, I urge the members of the Joint Standing Marine Resources Committee
to support LD 1552 and the creation of the Lobster Innovation Fund. By investing in 
innovation and promoting harvester participation in experimental gear trials, we can 
help to sustain the lobster fishery and ensure that this vital industry continues to thrive
for years to come. Thank you for your attention to this important issue
Sincerely,
