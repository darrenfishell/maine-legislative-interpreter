Greetings to the Judiciary Committee,
I am hoping you will vote "ought not to pass" on this legislation. Our resources 
should be focused on the issues that we are facing in this state right now. Hours could 
be spent defining "abnormally" dangerous when we all know that firearms are 
inherently dangerous. Please throw this bill out and focus on what we can do to help 
our children. Let's see legislation that helps make Maine the best state for adoption. 
Or creates a better DHHS system. How can we keep our young people off deadly 
narcotics! Do something productive other than waste precious time!
