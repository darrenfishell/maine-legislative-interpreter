Hello, My name is Guy Austin Woodruff
I am categorically against this blatant attempt to bankrupt the gun industry. This is a 
back door work around the second amendment. I ask that you vote this down and get 
rid of this bill before it even has a chance to do damage.
Allowing this to go into effect would bankrupt the gun industry without even needing 
a cause. I mean this bill would allow someone to attack the industry with multiple 
lawsuits and even if they lose you can not get your legal fees. I believe that this would
open the door to 1 shop being sued by the same person 100 times and costing 
thousands or even millions of dollars in defense costs, and in essence, bankrupting the
business. Why would we allow such a blatant attack on the gun industry? We should 
be strengthening the Second Amendment. 
In addition to the outright contradiction to federal law.
