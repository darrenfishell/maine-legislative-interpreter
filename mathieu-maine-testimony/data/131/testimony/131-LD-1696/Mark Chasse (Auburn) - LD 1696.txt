LD 1696 Ought-NOT-to pass as this is bullsh*t legislation with the bill contents 
designed to end run the constitution. I suspect this bill was fashioned with the help of 
our federal government who wont prosecute a case against Hunter Biden for breaking 
firearm laws.
Laws Already exist that support the purchase of anything from a manufacturer except 
certain experimental vaccines.
Thank you.
