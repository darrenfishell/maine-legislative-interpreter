I oppose LD 1696.
Vehicle manufacturers are not sued when their vehicles are illegally used by drunk 
drivers.
Fast food chains are not sued for an increase in obesity rates.  
Firearms manufacturers should not be sued for the improper use of their products.  
Implementing such a system would be an unfair and egregious overstep by the State 
and would shut down firearm commerce in Maine overnight.
