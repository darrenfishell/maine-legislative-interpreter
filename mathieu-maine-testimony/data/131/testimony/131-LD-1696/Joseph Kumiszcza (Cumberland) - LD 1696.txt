LD 1696
I am writing in opposition to LD 1696, An Act to Create a Civil Cause of Action for 
Persons Suffering Damages Arising from the Sale of Abnormally Dangerous 
Firearms.
This bill was created to add confusion to existing law. Legal firearm businesses and 
individuals should not be held accountable for crimes committed by another person. I 
urge the committee to vote "Out Not to Pass" on LD 1696.
