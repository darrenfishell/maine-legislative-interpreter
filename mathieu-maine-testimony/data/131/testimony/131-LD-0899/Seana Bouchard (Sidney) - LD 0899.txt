Dear Senator Bailey, Representative Perry and members of the Health Coverage and Financial Services 
Committee: 
 My name is Seana Bouchard I’m a pharmacy manager at Shaw’s pharmacy in Augusta. Some of 
you might recognize me since I’ve done the state of Maine flu clinics for the past 3 years. I am a resident 
of Sidney Maine and have been practicing pharmacy for 7 years. I am submitting testimony in support of 
LD 899. Having our technicians become immunizers has been beneficial not only to us as pharmacists 
but to the community as well. We are able to make a larger impact in our community with the added 
support of technician immunizers. Technicians are an essential part of the pharmacy team and having 
them immunize helps with daily workflow of the pharmacy. In my opinion technicians have done an 
amazing job stepping up in the time of need for our community and I would hope they are able to 
continue doing so.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Seana Bouchard
