Vaccine Administration Training Requirements for Pharma cists 
Public Hearing: Thursday, March 16, 2023 1:00 PM,Cross Building, Room 220  
 
Senator  Bailey, Representative  Perry and distingu ished members of the Committee on Health Coverage, 
Insurance and Financial Services , 
 
My name is Adele Carroll , DO and I am re tired Family Medicine Physician living in Eagle Lake, M aine.  
I am please d to provide  testimon y on behalf of the Maine Osteopathic Association  neith er for nor 
against LD 899 .  
 
The Maine Ost eopathic Association (MOA) is a professional organization representing approx imately 
400 osteopathic physicians as well as more t han 700 residents and students. Our missio n is to “ serve the 
Osteopathic profession of the State of Maine through a coordinated  effort of professional education, 
advocacy and member services in order to e nsure the availability of quality osteopathic health  care to the 
people of  this State.”  
 
Make no mistake, I comm end Maine ’s pharmac ists, pharmacy technicians and others  for recognizing the 
immediate need for vaccine administration during the C OVID -19 pandemic. It w as all hands on deck 
during that time in trying to keep people safe. It was a time when all health care professionals needed to 
work t ogether for the common good.  
 
It was during this time that I offered my services to an area pharmacy to assist in giving C OVID -19 
vaccines at pharmacy -sponsored clinics, having over 50 years of experience in giving injections first as a 
nurse, as a n urse practitioner, then as a solo practice physician. I was told that I could not participate 
unless I took a 15-hour didactic cour se on how to give injections sponsored by the Board of Pharmacy, 
even though I was a licensed physician with years of experie nce.  Not only was that insulting, but it was 
a poor use of trained manpower at a time when vaccines needed to be administered as q uickly as 
possible. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were the only people authorized to administer the 
vaccines at these clinics  without the  additional course . 
 
It is unfortunate that many physicians no longer offer vaccines to be administered in their offices. 
Anticipating which v accines might be needed, buying them, storing them, and so on, hoping that they 
would be given before their expiration date t ook significant planning to make the purchases 
economically worthwhile. Now vaccines are bought, stored and administered by the pha rmacists at area 
pharmacies . I can understand the logic in doin g this, but the end result is that pa tients have to make 
separate appointments for vaccines that used to be administered by their primary care providers . 
 

 2 As part of my ongoing medical care as a patient, I have had num erous vaccines administered to me by a 
pharmacist, some of which made me wonder where he/she had learned to do the procedure. I have had a 
few that were well done, but also others that gave me pause. When receiving an injection, I do make it a 
point to all ow the pharmacist to give the injection without any comment or interference on my part, 
trusting that the person knows what he/she is doing.  I have found it difficult to maintain my trust after 
getting a painful injection just bel ow the acromion process ( shoulder bone) where there are numerous 
tendons instead of the deltoid muscle. It was obvious to me that the pharmacist had little knowledge of 
where the deltoid muscle was. Now when I need a vaccine, I put two fingers below the ac romion and 
leave them the re forcing the vaccinator to inject the muscle below the fingers. It would be well for 
pharmacists to encourage the patient to let his/her arm “hang” loosely, thereby making the injection less 
painful when administered, a recommend ation that I did not rece ive. 
 
Based upon these experiences, I  am left to ponder if the training ph armacists and their technicians are 
receiving is robust enough as is. Vaccine  procedure s should be taught by individuals who have 
significant experience in g iving them  and certainly  if physicians who  have been administering  them for 
years need to undergo dozens of  hours of trainin g, then technicians should also have similar 
requirements  if not increased training to ensure that they are capab le and comfortable . 
 
Several of my colleagues als o raise  the issue that pharmacies rarely share patient ’s records with their 
PCPs , which makes it difficult to provide appropriate  follow up care or care following  complications . 
Pharmacies don’t have the capacity to deal with  adverse vaccine reactions or other complications related 
to the administration of vaccines, so follow up and sharing of these r ecords with primary care providers 
is key for appropriate continuity  of care.  
 
Greater access  to vaccinations is crucial  to robust preventive  medicine, but w e would encourage the 
committee to carefully consider the  implicati ons of  letting emergency  provisions continue . Continuity of 
care and robust training are two are as of consideration we think are of utmost importance  here.
