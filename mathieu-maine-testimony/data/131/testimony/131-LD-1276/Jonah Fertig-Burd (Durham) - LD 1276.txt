LD 1276
Dear Members of the Taxation Committee, I am writing in support of LD 1276 as it 
would help preserve and grow jobs, business, farms and affordable housing in Maine. 
I am a worker-owner of a cooperative farm and have seen the benefits of broad based 
cooperative ownership and am excited to see the Maine state government support 
more people in Maine being owners of their own businesses. This will help to 
stabilize and support our economy and keep more jobs in Maine meeting needs in our 
communities. I urge you to support this legislation.
