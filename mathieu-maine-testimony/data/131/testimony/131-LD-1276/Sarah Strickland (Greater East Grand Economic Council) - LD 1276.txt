The Greater East Grand Economic Council (GEGEC) represents the region and serves as a catalyst, convener and project manager for priorities that are critical to the region’s economic recovery and future vitality.  LD1276 is important legislation that will impact a critical project in the region. Danforth as a mini-service center has 1 grocery store, 1 bank, 1 gas station/restaurant, East Grand School, East Grand Health Center, and a handful of small businesses, most notably, Dave’s Hardware Store.   Like many small, family-owned businesses in rural Maine, the hardware store owners have been ready to retire for some time, and the business has been on the market for five years without a buyer. Over the past year, local leadership has been pursuing the idea of whether a community-owned cooperative could be the vehicle to keep this cornerstone business alive and well. LD1276 is exactly the type of business succession legislation needed to help incentivize current business owners and small towns to preserve viable, established businesses that are the life blood of their community.  The people of the Greater East Grand Region hope you will give every consideration to this important economic and community development legislation.
