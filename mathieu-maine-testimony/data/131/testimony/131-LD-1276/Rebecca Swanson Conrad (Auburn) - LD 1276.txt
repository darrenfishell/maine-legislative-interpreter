Auburn
LD 1276
Good afternoon Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry and members of the Taxation
Committee.
My name is Rebecca Swanson Conrad and I live in Auburn. I previously served as 
president and CEO of the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and 
currently work as a consultant addressing community and economic development 
projects across Maine, including worker-owned cooperatives. I am currently advising 
the 6th new cooperative business to open in Androscoggin County in the last 5 years. 
I support cooperative and employee-owned business structures as they reinvest profits
into the communities they serve, have high employee retention rates and generate 
higher wages.
My region’s economy is built on small businesses, many still family owned. As a 
Chamber president, l was often asked to provide resources when business owners had 
no succession plan.  LD 1276 to Create and Sustain Jobs through Development of 
Cooperatives and Employee-owned Businesses would be a very effective tool to 
strengthen local ownership and control, and promote economic and community 
development. Reducing the cost of financing through income tax exemption should 
become a significant incentive to convert business assets to cooperative or employee 
ownership. By passing LD1276 and establishing an Employee Ownership Center, in 
2024, Maine’s access to federal grants and technical assistance will increase 
significantly to support this method of business succession. The concept of 
cooperatives or Employee Stock Ownership Plans is based on retaining talent, in 
Maine's case trained workers, surely able and likely willing to keep successful 
businesses active within the State's economy. LD1276 is smart tax policy that will 
stimulate expansion by preserving and growing jobs. .
Over a dozen states have garnered bi-partisan support to create similar incentives and 
technical assistance programs to increase cooperative and employee ownership. 
I encourage Maine to join this leadership effort to create a pathway toward economic 
sustainability for our small business sector, thereby strengthening Maine’s overall 
economy. 
Respectfully submitted,
