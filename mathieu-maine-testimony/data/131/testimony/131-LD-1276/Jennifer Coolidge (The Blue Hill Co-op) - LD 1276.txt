LD 1276
I support LD 1276 because I'm a Mom of 4 amazing humans. When they graduate 
from school I would love Maine to be a place where they can stay and earn a living. I 
work for a co-op and believe in the long term stability of the co-operative business 
model. LD 1276 will help create employee-owned Maine jobs. Research shows that 
young workers in employee-owned companies are in much better financial shape with
33% higher wages, 92% higher household wealth, and 53% higher job tenure. Please 
pass LD 1276.
