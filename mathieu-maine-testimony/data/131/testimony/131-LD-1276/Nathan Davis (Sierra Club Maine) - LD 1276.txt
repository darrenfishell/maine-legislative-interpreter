Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
members
of
the
Committee
On
Taxation,
my
name
is
Nathan
Davis,
and
I
write
on
behalf
of
Sierra
Club
Maine,
representing
over
22,000
supporters
and
members
statewide.
Founded
in
1892,
Sierra
Club
is
one
of
our
nation’s
oldest
and
largest
environmental
organizations.
We
work
diligently
to
amplify
the
power
of
our
3.8
million
members
nation-wide
as
we
work
towards
combating
climate
change
and
promoting
a
just
and
sustainable
economy.
To
that
end,
we
urge
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
L.D
1276:
An
Act
to
Create
and
Sustain
Jobs
and
Affordable
Housing
Through
the
Development
of
Cooperatives
and
Employee-owned
Businesses.
The
Sierra
Club
has
a
long
history
of
solidarity
with
the
labor
and
economic
justice
movements.
1
In
addition,
an
attitude
towards
economic
justice
is
implicit
in
the
second
line
of
our
mission
statement:
“To
practice
and
promote
the
responsible
use
of
the
earth's
ecosystems
and
resources”.
That
economic
inequality
contributes
to
environmental
destruction
is
well-documented.
A
2018
Scientific
American
article
makes
this
plain:
“Power
imbalances
facilitate
environmental
degradation
-
and
the
poor
suffer
the
consequences.”
2
One
way
to
tilt
this
power
imbalance
back
towards
the
workers
whose
labor
drives
our
economy
is
to
do
what
we
can
to
promote
cooperatives
and
employee-owned
businesses.
The
most
robust
research
of
which
we
are
aware
concerning
the
economic
impact
of
cooperatives
comes
from
a
2009
study
conducted
by
the
University
of
Wisconsin
Center
for
Cooperatives.
3
Even
then,
the
economic
impact
was
enormous:
“Nearly
30,000
U.S.
cooperatives
operate
at
73,000
places
of
business
throughout
the
U.S.
These
cooperatives
own
>$3T
in
assets,
and
generate
>$500B
in
revenue
and
>$25B
in
wages.
Extrapolating
from
the
sample
to
the
entire
population,
the
study
estimates
that
cooperatives
account
for
nearly
$654B
in
revenue,
>2M
jobs,
$75B
in
wages
and
benefits
paid,
and
a
total
of
$133.5B
in
value-added
income.”
L.D.
1276
would
establish
tax
incentives
to
encourage
the
sale
of
businesses
to
employees
and
cooperatives
(including
consumer
cooperatives
and
cooperative
affordable
housing
corporations)
and
assist
in
the
financing
of
such
sales.
It
would
also
create
a

Center
to
advise
and
assist
in
the
formation
and
financing
of
employee-owned
businesses.
Finally,
it
would
establish
policy
objectives
such
as
job
retention
and
the
expansion
of
affordable
housing,
as
well
as
performance
measures
to
ensure
that
the
tax
incentives
achieve
these
policy
objectives.
We
believe
that
this
bill
is
likely
to
increase
the
number
and
strength
of
cooperative
enterprises
in
Maine,
and
we
support
it
strongly.
We
encourage
you
to
vote
“ought
to
pass”
on
L.D.
1276.
Thank
you
for
your
time
and
consideration.
