LD 1276
Dear Members of the Taxation Committee,
I am submitting testimony on behalf of Celebration Tree Farm & Wellness Center, 
LLC.  We are a cooperative Christmas tree farm and wellness center in Durham.  We 
converted to a cooperative from a sole propiertorship and worked with Land in 
Common Community Land Trust to purchase 110 acres of land where we currently 
have our tree farm.  We utilize ecological forestry practices that work to sequester 
carbon and increase forest biodiversity.  We are in support of LD 1276 because we 
see how this legislation could have been helpful for us when we purchased our farm 
and business and we see how this legislation can help secure more farms, housing, 
and businesses for the future of Maine.  Cooperatives can help build community 
wealth, good jobs, and secure affordable housing for our neighbors.  LD 1276 will 
help more people in Maine to have agency, ownership, and security.
