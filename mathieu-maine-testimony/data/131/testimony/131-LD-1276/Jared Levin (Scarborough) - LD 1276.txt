Jared Levin
Scarborough
LD 1276
Hello, my name is Jared Levin and I am the President and CEO of a 100% 
employee-owned ESOP called Mainely Tubs--a retailer and servicer of Hot Tubs, 
Swim Spas and Saunas based in Scarborough, Maine.  Mainely Tubs currently has 
just over 110 team members, up from approximately 40 when we became employee 
owned in 2016.
We at Mainely Tubs strongly support LD 1276 because we have seen the wonderful 
impact that employee ownership has had on our business and on each team member.  
Team members throughout the organization have built up meaningful savings for 
retirement, and unwanted turnover has been exceptionally low, despite low 
unemployment.  Once team members have been with us for 18 months (enough time 
to qualify for our ESOP), they rarely leave.  Morale is high, as measured by internal 
surveys, and for two years in a row we have also been named a Best Place to Work in 
Maine.  
We strongly believe that all members of ESOP's (rather than just a single owner) will 
be substantially better off in their retirement than they would have been at a 
comparable business that was not employee owned, and are also likely to be stronger 
businesses as a result of lower turnover and higher morale.  This is a wonderful way 
to broaden the distribution of wealth among greater numbers of Mainers, and to 
strengthen our local businesses.
