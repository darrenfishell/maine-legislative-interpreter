LD 1276
I have spent the last twelve years of my life in the cooperative world. I have learned 
that cooperative ownership is a fantastic alternative to sole proprietorship/LLCs, etc. 
Cooperatives put their employees first, they keep their profits local which benefits 
their communities, and they are supported by the people who use their services, as 
well as employed and run by the people who OWN the co-op.
When employees own their businesses collectively, as is the case with a cooperative, 
they are incentivized to be better, often creating an atmosphere where the whole is 
greater than the sum of the parts.
 
LD1276 would make these types of situations more likely and will serve to strengthen
communities throughout the state of Maine. Maine can also be at the forefront of this 
movement and show the rest of the country that cooperatives are a sound business 
model with huge impacts for communities, both rural and non.
Thank you.
