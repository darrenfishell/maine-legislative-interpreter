Senator
Grohoski,
Representative
Perry,
and
members
of
the
Committee,
my
name
is
Kate
Ahlefeld
and
I
am
the
Secretary
of
the
Board
of
the
Liberty
Graphics
Employee
Cooperative.
I
am
testifying
in
support
of
LD
1276,
An
Act
to
Create
and
Sustain
Jobs
and
Affordable
Housing
through
Development
of
Cooperatives
and
Employee-owned
Businesses.
Since
1977,
Liberty
Graphics
has
flourished
in
the
rural
village
of
Liberty,
Maine.
Founder
Tom
Opper
and
his
partner,
artist
Beverly
Kocenko,
created
the
company
in
a
tiny
trailer
on
his
property
and
began
producing
small
batches
of
T-shirts
silk-screened
by
hand.
Over
the
years,
appreciation
for
the
art
and
process
grew
in
the
community
and
beyond.
We
began
selling
to
national
and
international
customers,
and
our
company
became
known
as
Maine’s
original
water-based
ink
T-shirt
printer.
After
many
successful
years,
Owner
Tom
Opper
was
looking
for
a
way
to
step
back
from
the
day-to-day
obligations
of
running
a
business.
In
2019,
Liberty
Graphics
employees
began
talking
to
Opper
about
the
potential
of
buying
the
company
through
a
worker
cooperative.
Most
of
our
employees
have
been
with
the
company
for
decades,
and
they
wanted
to
see
the
business
remain
in
Liberty
and
continue
the
momentum
that
was
started
in
the
late
70’s.
It
took
more
than
two
years
of
careful
planning
to
bring
the
Liberty
Graphics
Employee
Cooperative
to
fruition.
We
now
have
22
member-owners
with
another
8
likely
to
join
on
June
1,
2023
out
of
a
total
of
35
employees.
The
employees
are
truly
invested
in
their
work,
and
enjoy
having
a
say
in
the
direction
of
the
company.
The
Bangor
Daily
News
ran
a
front-page
article
on
May
12,
2021,
chronicling
our
transition
from
private
to
cooperative
ownership:

conic-maine-t-shirt-company/
This
cooperatively-owned
business
model
has
also
helped
us
to
attract
new
employees
who
are
excited
about
being
a
part
of
a
cooperatively-owned
enterprise.
We
are
thrilled
to
keep
the
business
in
rural
Liberty,
Maine,
where
there
aren’t
a
lot
of
good
job
prospects.
Liberty
has
a
vibrant
community
though,
and
living
close
to
work
allows
us
more
time
to
engage
in
local
affairs.
We
believe
strongly
that
LD1276
should
be
made
into
law.
Cooperative
ownership
has
benefitted
Liberty
Graphics
and
allowed
our
business
to
continue
and
thrive.
We
hope
that
other
businesses
in
Maine
will
have
the
same
opportunity
when
the
time
comes.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration.
Sincerely,
Katharine
H.
Ahlefeld,
Board
Secretary
