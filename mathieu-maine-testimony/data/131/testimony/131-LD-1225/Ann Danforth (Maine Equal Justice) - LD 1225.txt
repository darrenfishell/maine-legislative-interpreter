Testimony on Behalf of Maine Equal Justice in support of LD 1225, An Act to Protect Housing by 
Increasing the Property Tax Fairness Credit 
April 11, 2023 
Good afternoon Senator Grohoski, Representative Perry, and members of the Taxation Committee. My 
name is Ann Danforth and I use she/her pronouns. l'm a Policy Advocate at Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit 
legal aid provider working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for people in Maine. 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in support of LD 1225. 
The property tax fairness credit provides real estate tax relief to both renters and homeowners. LD 1225 
would increase the maximum property tax fairness credit from $1,000 to $1,500 for residents under 65 
years of age and from $1,500 to $2,000 for residents 65 years of age or older. 
Low income Mainers are struggling with housing and rental costs 
Tax relief programs that provide relief to renters, as opposed to just homeowners, are particularly 
important because of Maine's existing housing crisis, which is disproportionately harming renters. The 
pandemic has pushed Maine’s housing affordability problems to a crisis point. While Maine's low-income 
residents have been suffering in the recession and the pandemic, business has been booming in Maine’s 
real estate market. Property values have increased during the pandemic in every county across the State. 
The Maine Association of Realtors reported a 22% increase in median sales price between Fall 2019 and 
Fall 2020, with a 27% increase in the number of units sold.‘ Gains are expected to continue, fueled in 
part by out-of-state buyers moving to Maine? Rent costs in Maine increased 13% from June 2021 to 
2022. Maine has also seen a 39% increase in rent since the COVID-19 pandemic started? 
While so many people are buying new Maine homes, many Mainers are struggling to stay in theirs. 
Increasing property values are linked to gentrification. Gentrification is a process which displaces

low-income community members, usually renters, when more affluent people move in. Gentrification is 
spurred by speculation in the real estate market which incentivizes landlords to raise rents and/or evict 
tenants to pursue higher-end development. This is occurring not only in Maine's cities, but also in rural 
parts of the State.‘ We must confront the fact that gains for some result in losses for others and take 
steps to end the rental housing crisis, while at the same time, providing targeted relief for renters 
through existing programs like the PTFC. 
Maine's housing crisis disproportionately affects renters. With the end of rental assistance, with 
average rents increasing more than 14% year to year,5 with housing prices soaring, and with the 
seventh highest in-migration in the country between April 2020 and July 2O22,6 the ingredients for 
housing crisis are being mixed together. As of 2022, nationwide, at least 20% of renters are currently 
behind on payments. ’ From 2001 to 2018, ”renter incomes grew by 0.5 percent” while "rents 
increased by 13 percent. ”8 The end of rental assistance and the rises in rental costs has led to at least 
41% of tenants in Maine being ”cost-burdened" (spending more than one-third of their gross income 
on rent) and 20% of those being "severely" cost-burdened (spending more than half of their income 
on rent).9 These rent burdened Mainers are some of the people most directly harmed by Maine's 
housing crisis and the people most desperately in need of the relief provided by the Property Tax 
Fairness Credit. 
The Property Tax Fairness Credit provides targeted relief to low income renters and homeowners 
The Property Tax Fairness Credit seeks to take steps to provide relief to people paying a disproportionate 
portion of their income towards property taxes by providing a portion of the property tax or rent paid 
during the tax year back to the tax filer. 
Unlike some of the other programs and proposals this committee has and will consider, such as the 
Property Tax Freeze, Homestead Exemption, and the Property Tax Deferral Program, the PTFC provides 
targeted relief to both renters and homeowners. This makes it a program that better serves people with 
low-income, targeting our resources and with the recognition that renters are facing a property tax

burden as well, and are typically less wealthy than homeowners. Furthermore, the credit is income 
targeted, available to people with low to moderate incomes only. And lastly, the credit is fully 
refundable, meaning it is available to people with the lowest income who are in greatest need of 
financial support. 
Expanding the maximum amount of the PTFC will build on an established and effective program. 
We applaud the fact that over the past few years, the Administration and legislature have taken steps to 
expand the PTFC” , recognizing its value to Maine people: 
Tax Year Income Threshold Credit Maximum (Und er E5 I 65 and elder} 
2019 _ 6% $150 I $1.200 
2020 5% $150“; $1,200 
20210 
5% $1,000 /$1,500 
2022 and later $1,000/$1,500 
Approximately 54,000 taxpayers received the PTFC based on the 2022-2023 Maine Tax Expenditure 
Report“ , a number that grew to approximately 87,000 taxpayers in tax year 2021 according to the 
2023-2024 Maine Tax Expenditure Report”. 
LD 1225 would build on this progress to further improve a proven effective program by increasing the 
maximum amount people are eligible for by $500. 
Conclusion 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on these bills. l am happy to answer any questions you might 
have.
