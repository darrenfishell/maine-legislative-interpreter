Jess Maurer
Maine Council on Aging
LD 1225
Esteemed members of the Taxation Committee:
My name is Jess Maurer, and I am the Executive Director of the Maine Council on 
Aging (MCOA). The MCOA is a broad, multidisciplinary network of over 135 
organizations, businesses, municipalities, and older community members working to 
ensure we can all live healthy, engaged and secure lives with choices and 
opportunities as we age at home and in community settings.
Please accept my apologies for the informality of this testimony - we wanted to make 
sure you know of our support, but have limited ability to provide formal testimony on 
all of the bills that impact older Mainers.   We fully support LD 1225 and all other 
efforts to address the economic insecurity of older Mainers.  As you may know, about
a third of people over 65 in Maine live on social security alone, with an average 
income of about $22,000 - $6,000 less than what our state has determined is the 
minimum wage in this state.  
It is impossible for an older person to live on this limited fixed income while prices 
for everything go up exponentially.  This means older folks have to make hard 
decisions between buying food, heating their homes, paying for healthcare and 
prescription drugs, and still meeting their obligations for property taxes and other 
expenses.  
We encourage the Committee to vote in favor of LD 1225 to provide much needed 
economic relief to older Maine residents.  Thank you.
