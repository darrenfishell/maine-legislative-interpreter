Testimony  in Support  of LD 1225   
(“An Act to Protect  Housing  by Increasing  the Property  Tax Fairness  Credit”) 
J. Andrew  Cashman  on behalf  of the Maine  Association  of REALTORS®  
April  11, 2023 
 
Senator  Grohoski , Representative  Perry  and members  of the Joint  Standing  Committee  
on Taxation , my name  is Andy  Cashman.   I am the Founder  of Resolve  Government  
Relations , and we represent  the Maine  Association  of REALTORS®,  a professional  trade  
association  established  in 1936  with over 6,500  members  statewide.  REALTORS®  grow  
Maine’s  economy  and build  Maine  communities.  Our members  represent  buyers  and 
sellers  involved  in both residential  and commercial  real estate  transactions.  Our 
membership  also includes  industry  affiliates,  such  as lenders,  closing  agents,  title 
agents,  appraisers,  building  inspectors,  surveyors,  etc. The Maine  Association  is 
chartered  by the National  Association  of REALTORS®  (NAR),  the largest  trade  
association  in the country.   
The Maine  Association  of REALTORS®  supports  LD 1225 . The bill would  increase  the 
property  tax fairness  credit  from $1000  to $1500  for residents  under  65 years  of age, 
and from $1500 to $2000  for residents  over 65. 
This credit  is another  policy  to help make  housing  slightly  more  affordable  for 
homeowners . This modest  increase  proposed  by the bill could  allow  for some  people  
to stay in their homes , and for those  over the age of 65, the ability  to age in place  on a 
fixed  income.  We face unprecedented  inflation  and economic  pressures  that are 
causing  many  to encounter  financial  hardship  and this exacerbat es housing  
affordability . Rising  property  taxes only compound  these  pressures.  For this reason,  
we believe  this is the right time to increase  this credit.  
For these  reasons,  we urge you to vote Ought  to Pass  on LD 1225 . Thank  you for your 
time and consideration.
