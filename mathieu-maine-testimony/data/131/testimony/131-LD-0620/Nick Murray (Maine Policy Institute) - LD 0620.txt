Testimony in Support of LD 620,
“An Act to Promote
Free Trade by Preventing
Municipalities from Prohibiting the Sale of Legal Goods”
Senator Nangle, Representative Stover, and the distinguished members of the
Committee on State and Local Government, my name is Nick Murray and I serve as
director of policy for Maine Policy Institute. We are a free market think tank, a
nonpartisan, non-profit organization that advocates for individual liberty and economic
freedom in Maine. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on LD 620.
While this bill should not be necessary today, it is. Entities funded by the State of
California advocate in communities all across the state to ban flavored tobacco at the
local and state level. Advocates push these misguided policies, ignoring the disastrous
consequences that it had on Massachusetts business, as well as state coffers.

Business owners should not be subject to the whims of their local officials as to
the products they are allowed to sell to willing customers, as long as they are not
prohibited by state law from doing so. Maine lawmakers should step in to protect
business owners and consumers alike.
Please deem LD 620 “Ought To Pass” and ensure municipalities do not overstep
their role to overregulate and prohibit state-legal commerce. Thank you for your time
and consideration.
