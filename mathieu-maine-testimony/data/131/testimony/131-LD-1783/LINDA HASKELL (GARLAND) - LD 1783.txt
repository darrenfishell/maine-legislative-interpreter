LD 1783 - An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Governor's Advisory 
Council on Military Sexual Trauma  LINDA HASKELL Testimony opposing LD 
1783
Chairman Supica, Senator Hickman and committee members. This is just an addition 
to Acts being proposed for the benefit of LGBQ and what not, that are trying to make 
it their place to have any and all "special" recognition. This is already covered in the 
Constitution to without going to this far reaching proposed Act. The Legislature and 
Senate were organized to protect and govern "the people", not for the benefit of "soft 
shelled individuals with a chip on their shoulders" and their choice to become 
unnatural to the God Given form of a human being. The National Guard is to protect 
the State and Union. Is the legislature going to lie down and cry every time an 
individual cries "my feelings are hurt"?  What happened to the "don't ask and don't 
tell". I see individuals that are transforming their gender, splashing it in other faces, 
unnecessarily. Ought not to pass. LINDA HASKELL, Testimony to oppose.
