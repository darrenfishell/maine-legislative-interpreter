LD 1783
As a current member of the Maine Army National Guard, and one who has tracked 
this issue from the time I transferred from Pennsylvania, I fully believe that LD 1783 
should be passed.  While I see a sea change in the Guard since coming back on duty 
in September, the recommendations of the Advisory Council will build towards an 
institutional embrace, not just the near-term action we've seen as a result of the 
publicized details of recent investigative reporting.
I only have one suggestion with regards to the legislation, and that is within Sec. 4. 
37-B MRSA ยง390-D.  It is very important to note that "full-time member" of the 
National Guard holds a variety of connotations.  A federal technician, while wearing a
uniform full-time, can only be placed on leave by state law while serving on their drill
weekends or other state duty.  While it's unlikely, other full-time Guard members on 
"Active Guard and Reserve" status may actually be on Title 32 status.  Additionally, 
there are "short tour" full-time positions known as Active Duty for Operational 
Support, Reserve Component (ADOS-RC) that can be either Title 10 or Title 32 
status.  It may be important to clarify, as this law could not apply to Guard members 
in a Title 10 or federal employment status.
