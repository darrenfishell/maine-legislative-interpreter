ON LD 1455, "An Act to Establish the We ighing Point Preclearance Program" 
 
 
Good afternoon, Senator Chipman, Representative Williams, and distinguished members of 
the Committee on Transportation. My name is Steve Vaughn, Senior Vice President at PrePass Safety Alliance. I'm here today to prov ide testimony on our support of LD 1455. 
 PrePass Safety Alliance (Alliance)  is a non-profit public-private partnership devoted to the 
safe, secure, and efficient use of North America’s highway system. Through the widespread deployment of PrePass advanced technologies, the Alliance works with government agencies 
to increase regulatory compliance in commerc ial vehicle operations and reduce congestion 
and emissions on our roadways. Through the PrePass program, the Alliance keeps qualified fleets of all sizes safely on the move by enabling them to bypass hundreds of weigh stations and ports of entry across the country, helping them save time, fuel, and money.   The Alliance Membership and Board of Directors are comprised of equal representation from state commercial vehicle compliance agencies and the trucking industry. The Board fulfills the 
critical role of developing PrePass operatio nal policies and best practices, vetting and 
authorizing new products and services, and ensuring that safety and regulatory compliance remain the Alliance’s principal focus.  The Alliance owns and operates PrePass, Nort h America's leading truck safety bypass and 
data platform and the only preclearance service developed, owned, and operated in the United States. States rely on PrePass to precle ar qualified commercial motor carriers to safely 
bypass ports of entry and weigh station facilities at highway speeds. More than 105,000 
qualified fleets subscribe over 750,000 commerc ial vehicles to PrePass services, including 
Knight-Swift Transportation, UPS, Walmart, Estes Express Lines, Old Dominion, and R.C. 
Moore. In Maine and nearby states, PrePass has 1,624 carriers that subscribe 9,383 trucks in our program who would benefit from the Allianc e being allowed to offer the PrePass program 
in the state.  The Alliance provides PrePass and any necessary infrastructure installation and maintenance 
at no cost to the states it serves. The Allianc e has invested over $900 million in developing 
and deploying PrePass infrastructure and services that improve safety, reduce truck-related emissions, and preserve highway infrastructure in 44 states.   Although PrePass Safety Alliance came into exis tence in 1993, PrePass traces its origins to a 
multi-year truck safety demonstration program that began in the mid-1980s. A group of innovative state Department of Transportation (DOT) directors and trucking executives 
sought a way to pre-screen and weigh safe and compliant commercial trucks at highway 
 
speeds. Pre-screening trucks would provide efficiencies to the industry and state enforcement 
agencies, focusing weigh station inspections on  carriers that needed attention, while safe 
trucks with solid safety scores and valid credentials bypass saving time, fuel, and money.  Known as the Crescent Project, the demonstration program brought together innovative 
representatives from British Columbia, Washingt on, Oregon, California, Arizona, New Mexico, 
and Texas. One of the hurdles facing the Crescent Project was overcoming an inherent distrust between public agencies (operators of the infrastructure, such as DOTs) and industry (trucking companies and drivers). The answer: create an independent third-party entity to provide a balanced perspective and ensure strict adherence to safe and efficient operation standards. Thus, PrePass Safety Alliance (FKA Heavy-vehicle Electronic License Plate, Inc.) was 
born.  PrePass Safety Alliance’s uniqu e public-private partnership (P3) bridges the gap between 
industry and government, promoting the highest level of cooperation. This unique collaboration enables the Alliance to deliver ad vanced safety transportation technologies 
developed with input from private and public sector stakeholders at no cost to our state partners. As a non-profit, all proceeds from the PrePass program are required to be reinvested in the program to further advance safe ty and efficiency on the nation’s highways.   
 
The Alliance is a member of all 50 state truc king associations, and the American Trucking 
Associations only Endorsed Featured Product. As part of our non-profit mission, the Alliance 
provides tremendous support to industry trade associations and organizations such as the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance to advance and recognize achievements in commercial 
vehicle safety.  At a time when many jurisdictions are experiencing a reduction in enforcement personnel, PrePass benefits provide great value.  Some of these benefits include:

The PrePass bypass system also provides benefits to carriers which include: 
 Drivers save time with PrePass, providing more hours on the road while improving 
compliance with hours-of-service requirements. 
 Allows for more reliable delivery times, reducing driver stress and improving route 
planning. 
 Helps better manage truck maintenance costs by reducing wear and tear on vehicles. 
 Drivers report the availability of weigh station bypass as a top consideration in 
choosing a motor carrier, making PrePass an excellent recruiting tool. 
 Improves safety around weigh stations – by reducing the number of slow-moving 
vehicles exiting and entering the highway. 
 Helps carriers meet environmental responsibilities through reduced truck emissions. 
 Real-time driver safety ALERTS™ keep drivers aware of dangerous road conditions. 
 Since The Alliance began compiling data in 1997, the PrePass® weigh station bypass program has provided: 
 Over 565 operational sites 
 85 million driver hours saved 
 415 million gallons of fuel saved 
 $8 billion in operational cost savings 
 935,000 metric tons of emissions reductions 
 Over one billion bypasses since 1997 
 The Alliance has made numerous attempts to work with Maine State Police to gain authorization to provide PrePass weigh station bypass in Maine since 2014. I have made five separate trips to Maine since 2014 to engage with the State Police to discuss the benefits of PrePass in hopes of identifying a mutually agreed upon path to provide PrePass in Maine. In addition to those visits, Alliance staff and I have discussed PrePass with Maine State Police 
officials at events such as the Commercial Ve hicle Safety Alliance (C VSA) Spring Workshop 
and Fall Conferences within that same time period. Each offer has been declined without explanation other than they alre ady have a bypass service.  
 If bypass services are provided at no cost to Maine, why would K Troop choose one over the 
other? Particularly when the ch oice is a foreign for-profit company over a U.S. based non-
profit organization like the Alliance. That choi ce stifles competition and forces motor carriers 
to subscribe to Drivewyze to bypass in Maine even though they might use PrePass to bypass 
everywhere else in the country. That added cost is passed on to Maine consumers.   
 
The Alliance prefers to come into the state as a valued partner, as we have done in nearly 
every other state in the country. However, with continued requests from PrePass customers and in the interest of providing carriers with a choice in bypass provider, we have elected to strongly support LD 1455. We do not wish to su pplant existing bypass providers or systems. 
The fact is that bypass systems can and do peac efully operate side by side while delivering a 
service that improves highway safety, reduce s harmful emissions, and protects taxpayer-
funded infrastructure.       LD 1455 is common sense legislation that affords bypass options for carriers and promotes safety and efficiency on Maine’s highways wh ile reducing harmful emissions.  The PrePass 
Safety Alliance appreciates the Committee on Transportation holding this Public Hearing and considering LD 1455. It signals the Committee’s commitment to building a safer and more efficient roadway system in the State of Ma ine for it’s citizens and more welcoming 
environment for commercial motor vehicle comp anies to operate in a safer, efficient and 
more economical fashion.
