Honorable legislators-
My name is Wendy Schlotterbeck and I have lived in Auburn, Maine for 31 years.
I am writing as a retired high school teacher, former youth minister, active community 
volunteer and concerned citizen
Two weeks ago I was shopping in our local Target store. I saw a former student of mine who 
was clearing food shelves and I stopped to say hi and ask what he was doing.
He said he started working at this store a few months ago and that this was the fourth time he
was instructed to completely clear the refrigerated case of vacuum sealed packages of 
cheeses, salamis, hummus... and take to the dumpster. The "sell by"dated indicated that 
these items needed to be dumped!
I asked who told him to dump the food and he said it was the manager. He said it was difficult
for him to do because he knew many in our community are going hungry and the food was 
still good. All the food was packaged in plastic and kept cold. 
The shopping cart with "expired" food was filled to overflowing and headed to the big 
dumpster out back.
This is outrageous!! Please pass LD 959  so this nutritious food can feed the hungry!
