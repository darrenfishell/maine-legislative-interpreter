Testimony in Support of LD 208: An Act Concerning Home Care Services  
 
Greetings Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services. I am Bridget Quinn, Associate State Director of 
Advocacy and Outreach for AARP Maine.  
 
AARP is the nation’s largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering 
Americans 50 and older t o choose how they live as they age. On behalf of our more than 
200,000 members statewide, thank you for the opportunity to share testimony. Today, I am 
sharing testimony in support of LD 208: An Act Concerning Home Care Services.  
 
Availability of home and  community -based services  (HCBS)  is a critical part of Maine’s 
long -term  services and supports system. Long -term services and supports (LTSS) provide 
help  with day -to-day tasks that support people with functional  limitations and/or cognitive 
impairments .1 HCBS is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of services that help 
people remain in their homes with the supports they need. Paid HCBS often complements 
the work family caregivers perform, which could also be considered HCBS.  
 
AARP’s 2021 Home and  Community Preferences survey found that over three -quarters 
(77%) of adults aged  50 and older want to remain in their homes as they age.2 In order to 
age in place many of Maine’s older adults will need support from a loved one and/or to 
access HCBS servi ces at some point. In fact, currently in Maine we have nearly 166,000 
unpaid family caregivers who are already supporting a loved one and allowing them to 
remain at home, where they want to be.3 
 
LD 208 directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a waiting list of 
individuals eligible for home care services . At AARP Maine we have heard stories and

anecdotes from individuals who have told us they are eligible for services but are not 
receiving them. To fully understand and then  address this issue Maine needs to understand 
how great the need is. LD 208 will provide a critical tool in understanding how many 
Mainers need service.  
 
I urge the members of this Committee to support LD 208. Thank you for the opportunity to 
provide test imony.  If you have questions for me, I can be reached at bquinn@aarp.org  or at
