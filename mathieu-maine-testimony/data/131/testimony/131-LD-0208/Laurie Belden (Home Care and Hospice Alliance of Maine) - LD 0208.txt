> Testimony in Support of 
April 10, 2023 
Senator Baldacci, Representative Meyer, and members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Health and Human Services, my name is Laurie Belden, a resident 
of Durham and the Executive Director of the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of 
Maine (Alliance). The Alliance is a network of home health care, hospice, home 
care and personal care providers across our State delivering in-home care to older 
adults and disabled individuals of all ages, allowing them to stay in their home 
and community. 
l'm here today to testify in support of LD 208, An Act Concerning Home Care 
Services. l wish to thank Representative Craven for sponsoring the bill. 
Waiting Lists for Home Care Services: 
The goal of LD 208 is to gain a better understanding of the outstanding need for 
home care services across the State, to aid providers and State agencies is their 
efforts to increase services and meet the needs of patients. As it stands, there are 
many children and adults across Maine going without the full home care services 
for which they are eligible under MaineCare Sections 19 and 96. However, it's 
challenging for providers to understand the scope of this problem — how many 
people are going without services, how many eligible hours are unstaffed, and the 
geographic distribution of those patients — given the current information 
collected and shared by the department. 
Currently, the Department does not keep waitlists for MaineCare Sections 19 and 
96. ln February, the Department released their Second Annual Report on "Efforts 
and Progress in Implementing the Recommendations of the Commission to Study 
Long-term Care Workforce lssues" pursuant to PL 2021, c. 398, Section AAAA-7. 
Table 3 in that report shows zero people on the waitlist for Sections 19 and 96; 
however, as we understand it, the Department does not keep a waitlist for these 
Sections and in fact there are many people waiting for these services. ln looking 
at that report, one might mistakenly believe that beneficiaries of all ages are 
receiving their full complement of care for which they have been deemed eligible. 
Upon closer inspection, however, over one-third of beneficiaries are receiving 
partial or no care at all under Section 19; and, even more alarming is the near fifty 
percent of Section 96 beneficiaries only receiving partial or no care at all. 
Individuals receiving care under these sections of MaineCare require care ranging 
from basic activities of daily living such as toileting and bathing, to more skilled 
care such as seizure management, feeding tube maintenance, medication 
administrations, airway/ ventilation care, as well as a number of other

interventions that are customarily delivered in acute, institutional settings by professional RNs and/or LPNs. 
Why are there so many people waiting for home care services across the state? There are two primary and 
related reasons — low MaineCare reimbursement rates and a shortage of workers. Recruiting and retaining 
clinical staff is essential to our industry to be able to fulfil the needs of this population of Mainers. 
Reimbursement rates for home care nursing services are significantly lower than market rates, at the same 
time that our state is struggling with a nursing shortage. While the Department has scheduled RN/LPN rates to 
be reviewed this calendar year, the process hasn't begun and we have concerns that we are realistically 
looking at 2024 or later for any implementation of rate relief. With the recent behavioral health rate 
adjustments, a certified behavioral health professional is now being reimbursed at a significantly higher level 
than RNs and LPNs in home care. 
The Alliance is supporting LD 208 in hopes that, while we wait for the increased reimbursement rates we so 
desperately need, we can get a more comprehensive picture of the service gaps and the volume of staff 
needed to deliver care to those all those that are eligible. 
l have included in my testimony an example of information the Department is sharing with the public in the 
area of children's behavioral healthl — we think a similar model could be used for home care services. 
Providers and patients would benefit from additional information, shared on an ongoing basis, related to how 
many people are waiting for services and where these patients reside. Geographic data is important for us to 
pinpoint ”care deserts” —those parts of Maine where there are little or no healthcare services. 
Assessments for medically-complex (Section 96) children: 
For MaineCare Section 96 in particular, in order to keep an accurate waitlist, it will be important for the State 
ensure that everyone who is in need of services receives an assessment. OADS has contracted with MAXIMUS 
Ascend to manage its Statewide Assessing Services, however lVlAXll\/lUS determines eligibility for programs 
and services only for adults age 21 or older. Assessments for disabled infants and children under the age of 21 
are conducted at the discretion of home health care providers. 
The Department has directed providers to conduct an assessment only if they have staff to meet the needs of 
the child. Given the shortage of home care nurses, many children who are eligible for services are not even 
being assessed. How many kids are falling through the cracks? Not getting the necessary care, not even getting 
noticed. We literally don't know — and we need to do better. 
By including this population in the State's Statewide Assessing Services, we can be better informed about the 
number of disabled children receiving care and those awaiting services. These children could then be 
incorporated into the wait list and the publicly-reported information that this bill calls for, as well. 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of this important legislation to ensure the safety 
and wellbeing of our fellow Mainers.
