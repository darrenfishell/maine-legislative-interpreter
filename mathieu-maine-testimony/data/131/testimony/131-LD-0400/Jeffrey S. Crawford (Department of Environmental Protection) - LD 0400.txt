In June 2007, the Maine Legislature enacted LD 1824, An Act To Regulate Outdoor 
Wood Boilers. This legislation established emission standards for new outdoor wood 
boilers (OWB) and directed the Department to adopt rules related to them stating, “The 
rules must include provisions relating to siting, operation and labeling requirements, 
stack heights, dealer and manufacturer reporting, public notification of emission 
standards and operation and siting requirements, code enforcement ofﬁcer training, 
nuisance conditions and existing inventory issues.” In response, the Department 
adopted Chapter 150, Control of Emissions From Outdoor Wood Boilers later that year. 
As background, when LD 1824 was enacted in 2007, outdoor wood boilers were 
unregulated by either the Department or the US EPA. At the time, the Department 
estimated that between 1990 and 2005, about 1900 outdoor wood boilers were installed 
in Maine, with an additional 500 installations forecast for 2006 alone. Although they 
provide a cost-effective means of providing residential and small commercial heating, 
most outdoor wood boilers produce significantly more particulate emissions than EPA 
certified wood stoves and are less efficient at delivering heat. The smoke contains 
potentially toxic organic pollutants and fine particulates which are emitted near ground 
level, and state agencies and municipal officials have dedicated significant resources to 
deal with complaints about outdoor wood boiler smoke causing a nuisance for residents 
of neighboring buildings. 
Chapter 150 establishes requirements for the sale and installation of new outdoor wood 
boilers, including particulate emission standards and requirements for setback and 
stack height, certiﬁcation, sell-through of existing inventory, and labeling. The rule also 
contains general provisions which apply to all OWB. These provisions include 
prohibited and allowed fuels, visible emissions standards, notice to buyers, and owner 
manual requirements. In addition, pursuant to the new legislation, for the purpose of 
this rule, the Department included a definition of “nuisance ” and a method by whicha

nuisance condition can be identiﬁed. Chapter 150 was adopted as an emergency major 
substantive rule and subsequently approved by the Legislature in 2008. 
Chapter 150 currently requires setbacks for outdoor wood and outdoor pellet boilers of 
250 feet from the nearest property line and 270 feet from the nearest neighboring 
dwelling for the highest emitting units (particulate emissions greater than 
0.60 lb/MMBtu) to as little as 20 feet from the nearest property line and 40 feet from the 
nearest neighboring dwelling for units meeting a lower 0.06 lb/MMBtu particulate limit. 
Although a number of states have enacted laws regulating OWBs, it wasn't until 2015 
that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated nationwide emission 
standards for new wood and pellet boilers. The new regulations, known as New Source 
Performance Standards (NSPS), phased in emission limits over a ﬁve-year period. 
Beginning in 2020, all new outdoor wood and pellet boilers must meeta 
0.10 lb/MMBtu emission limit.‘ 
In recognition of these newest standards, the Department appreciates the 
opportunity to provide the Legislature with an overview of current technology for 
wood and pellet boilers, their environmental and health impacts, and setback 
recommendations for the newest generation of boilers. At the same time, we have 
signiﬁcant concerns regarding the proposed December 6, 2023, submission 
deadline. Completion of a rigorous analysis by this date will strain the Bureau of Air 
Quality’s very limited resources and negatively affect our ability to effectively 
implement our core programs.

There is an alternative 0.15 lb/MMBtu limit for units tested with cordwood.
