Subject:  In favor of the LD1367 proposal to increase funding in subsidy to adult education programs  
 
Dear Education and Cultural Affairs committee members,  
 
It is my pleasure to enthusiastically recommend Lewiston Adult Education for the career programs they 
offer. This place has been and still is such a blessing to me.  
I arriv ed in the US about 2 years ago and had the amazing opportunity to start work ing as a volunteer at 
the center 6 months after my arrival. It was an enriching experience to be able to greet the students and 
the visitors, welcome and direct them depending on their needs. I later became a student myself when I 
joined the “ Applied Technology in the Workplace ” program.  
A month and a half of training paired with 10 months of volunteering at the Lewiston Adult Educatio n 
was all I needed to be noticed by  great companies and local administration s. I ended up working a t the 
Lewiston DHHS office . In my turn, I am able to give back to the State of Maine and spread the warm 
welcome I received when I first arrived.  
The State o f Maine does not only invest in the development of current a nd new programs at the Adult 
Education Centers across Maine but also in people’ s lives and their integration into the local society.  
 
Kind regards,  
Urgele Reningot
