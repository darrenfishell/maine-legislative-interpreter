Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan, and Distinguished Members of the Education  and 
Cultural Affairs Committee:  
LD 1367, An Act Regarding the Funding Formula for Adult Education  seeks to examine and 
revise the state subsidy formula for adult education. This bill asks for an increase of $1.5 million 
in adult education subsidy and would require the state office of adult education to notify the 
Governor and Legislature if adult education allocations drop below 95% of the year before. In 
such a case the Notif ication must indicate the total amount necessary to fulfill the state’s 
obligation for reimbursement and the total amount that is available. The total amount necessary 
to fulfill the state’s obligation for reimbursement has been $11 million for the last 3 years while 
the total amount available has been $5.2 million. The reimbursement amount  is unique for  each 
adult education program. However, no program is receiving their full reimbursement amount.  
Additionally, the bill requires the Department of Education  to convene a workgroup of 
stakeholders to examine the current state funding formula to ensure it meets a set of criteria 
established in the bill. Adult education subsidy  as outlined within  Title  20-A, §8607 -A was last 
examined in 2007. T he current state formula  calculate s the amount of adult education subsidy 
reimbursement programs are eligible to receive . Financial expenditures and revenue figures are 
collected  at the state level. To apply for adult education subsidy , adult education programs must 
submit  three documents from three different sources; 1) a completed EF -X-132 form; 2) a copy 
of FY22 local warrant(s) that include the date and the local share amount for adult education; 3) 
the FY22 EF -X-174 Course summary report from the adult education studen t information system 
(MaineSTARS) . 
The Department will be available to provide additional information  on LD  1367  and respond to  
any questions during the upcoming work session.  
 
 
Sincerely,

State Director of Adult Education
