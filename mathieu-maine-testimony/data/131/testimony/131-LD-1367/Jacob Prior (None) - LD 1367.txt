To Whom it May Concern, 
My name is Jacob Prior. lam unable to attend this event in person, but l would like to share my 
experience. I am a second-year apprentice with UA Local 716 Maine Plumbers and Pipeﬁtters. 
My trade of choice uses math all the time especially when reading or creating blueprints. l was 
never very good with paper tests or schoolwork in general so l knew l was eventually going to 
need some help with the ”book work" part of my program. l ended up struggling to pass a math 
ﬁnal which stopped me from being able to move forward despite doing well in all other areas. 
Not being in school for the past ten years did not help matters. l was in special education classes 
all throughout school and have been diagnosed with dyslexia and other learning difficulties that 
only affect me in school. All of the private math tutors that l spoke to when looking for help with 
my math wanted $50 dollars an hour. Liz, the math teacher has been beyond helpful. She is 
helping me become more comfortable and conﬁdent in my ability to pass my math ﬁnal whenI 
have the opportunity to retake it. l am very grateful to have access to the people and resources 
in this facility. lt’s a very useful program that has the right people running it. They deserve all 
the help they can get so we can as well. 
Please contact me if you have any questions about my experience. My phone number is 
(207)485-6609
