Senator Rafferty, Representative Brennan and Members of the 131st Legislature ’s Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs: 
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in favor of LD 1367. My name is Shirley Wright and I am the Executive 
Director of Maine Adult Education Association (MAEA). To say that I feel passionate about an increase in state subsidy 
for Maine Adult Education programs would be an understatement! This increase has been due for many years. Before 
2019, the subsidy remained stagnant at 4.9 million dollars. There was one increase of $300,000 to bump that up to 5.2 
million dollars but nothing since. This amount doesn’t even cover basic overhead or cost of living increases. l urge you to 
support this bill as it moves through the legislative process. 
Adult education is a separate line in each school budget. Schools develop their EPS budgets line by line and then adult 
education is added in as one sum (local share) each year to the local warrant. The adult education budget does increase 
the bottom line of school budgets but the subsidy that comes back to programs does not come via the ED 279. lt is 
calculated separately and sent separately. There is no mandatory match that towns make to adult education local share. 
Every penny they allocate is done voluntarily. Currently local communities are paying nearly three times what the state is 
supporting in subsidy dollars. 
The adult education subsidy formula defines a “ceiling” that is the maximum amount on which programs can be 
subsidized. The ceiling is calculated using the sum of the local share and the state subsidy in the same fiscal year, 
knowing that the actual subsidy payment will arrive two years later than when it is computed. From this ceiling, programs 
submit their expenditures in three broad categories - Instruction (subsidized at 75%), Administration (subsidized at 70%) 
and Supplies (subsidized at 50%.) Expenditures work through those categories, in that order, until the ceiling is reached. 
At that point, the calculation stops. in a best-case scenario, a program would only be entitled to receive 75% of their 
ceiling. Each of these categories is further defined in state law and guidance. 
Programs have received their estimated subsidy for 2023-2024 and it is approximately 47.5% of the total of what they 
should receive. if a program works through the subsidy process and should receive $75,000 in subsidy, this year, their 
estimate of what they will actually receive would be $35,250 orjust 47% of the total they should receive. Programs have 
been receiving approximately 50% of their subsidy for more than ten years and are charged with running a well rounded 
program with that amount. As far as we know, the Governor and the legislature have not been notified when funds dip 
this low. MAEA is asking that each be notified when this happens in this bill. MAEA would also like to see the subsidy 
letters to programs enhanced to add the total amount the program is eligible for, the amount they will actually receive and 
the percent of the prorate clearly noted on the subsidy letter. 
Because the total dollars available has stayed the same over the past ten plus years, It is virtually impossible to increase 
the subsidy received by a program unless the local share increases. And, when this happens, if one program goes up, 
others have to go down because there is only so much money. This seems counterproductive. 
Some amounts of funding have been added to the adult education state budget but they have been developed to support 
special projects and often some with many stipulations. This money is allocated through a grant process by Hub or 
region, not by program. Often programs can’t spend the money because it has to be spent in certain ways. Right now, 
there is a special project for Maine College and Career Access (MCCA) that must be spent only on that project. Ifa 
program has infrastructure needs like a basic literacy teacher or help to support teaching at the local corrections facility,
1. 
that need may not meet the criteria for MCCA and that need will go unmet unless the local taxpayers invest more money 
Adding money to the subsidy will allow each program to address their unique infrastructure needs in a fair manner. 
What would MAEA like to see change in the subsidy calculation/process? 
o MAEA would like to see subsidy fully funded on the state side. To do that, the amount of 5.2 million would need 
to double to 10.4 million and then a cost of living adjustment would need to be added each year. (This bill would 
start that process with an initial investment of 1.5 million dollars.) 
0 MAEA would like the concept of “volunta|y" contribution to adult education by town to be reviewed. All towns 
have adult learners in need. Those without programs now send their learners to the closest town without 
supporting that learning with tax dollars. 
0 MAEA would like a review of those areas covered by subsidy. For example, facility costs are not subsidized at 
this time. MAEA feels there are costs incurred by programs that should be subsidized. 
0 At this time, 75% of adult education teachers are part time. MAEA and program directors would like to see that 
number change so that more adult education teachers are full time with benefits. 
o MAEA would like to see local communities have incentives for investing in adult education. 
Adult education programs provide basic literacy (reading, writing, mathematics and digital), high school completion 
including the HiSET, English language learning, workplace training and so much more. Investing in these programs can 
only be a win for Maine to support more adults to enter work and/or post secondary education. Adult education isa 
critical part of any beginning educational pathway for adults. 
Attached please find a comparison spreadsheet that lists subsidy by program for the last year paid out, what that subsidy 
would look like with an additional 1.5 million dollars, what full funding would look like, and then, the local share in each 
program. As you can see, the local share is more than double that of the state share. 
Thank you for your time today. 
Sincerely, 
Shirley Wright, Executive Director 
Maine Adult Education Association
