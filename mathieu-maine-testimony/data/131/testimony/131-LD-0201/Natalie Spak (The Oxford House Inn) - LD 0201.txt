The Oxford House Inn
LD 201
We have owned The Oxford House Inn in Fryeburg Maine for 15 years and have 
found the opportunity to sell alcohol for guests to purchase to bring home (with a food
sale) to be very positive for our business over the last 3 years.  We find many people 
are still anxious to dine indoors with COVID-19 still prevalent an greatly appreciate 
being able to take home a restaurant quality meal and cocktail they would have 
otherwise not have been able to.  We have guests that will pick up food and a nice 
bottle of wine for elderly neighbors that are not able to get out of there house when 
we have winter temperatures in the 20's and 2 feet of snow & ice on the ground.  
Some of our guests don't see well at night, and have made a nice dinner w/ cocktail 
purchased before dark and then enjoyed in the comfort of their own home a weekly 
routine to look forward to.  I have also spoken to guests that will not drive after 
drinking any amount of alcohol, so being able to take a dinner,  cocktail and bottle of 
wine home allows them this pleasure.  I have not witnessed anything negative about 
the ability to legally sell alcohol to go when done in a responsible manner following 
the state of Maine's legal requirements.  I only see it as added revenue for both our 
business and the state of Maine and would like to see it continue.
