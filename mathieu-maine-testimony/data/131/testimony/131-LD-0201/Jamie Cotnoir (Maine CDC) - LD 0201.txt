Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs  
 
In Opposition to LD 201 
An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers and Distilleries to Sell Liquor for 
Off-premises Consumption and Cocktails for On- premises Consumption 
 
Sponsored by:  Senator Bradlee Farrin  
Hearing Date:  January 30, 2023 
 
Senator  Hickman , Representative  Supica , and members  of the  Joint Standing Committee on  
Veterans and Legal Aff airs, my name is Jam ie Cotnoir. I am the division director  for Disease 
Prevent ion at the  Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. I am here today to provide 
testimony on behalf of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to express our concerns with LD 201, An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers  and 
Distilleries to Sell Liquor for Off- premises Consumption and Cocktails for On- premises 
Consumption.  
 This bill makes permanent the changes to the liquor laws amended  by Public Law 2021, chapters 
3 and 91, allowing qualified on- premises retailers and qualified distilleries to sell liquor for off -
premise consumption under certain conditions and the sale of cocktails for on- premise 
consumption at distilleries and small d istilleries . LD 201 removes the 2025 effective date of the 
repeal  of certain provisions  authoriz ed by these laws for  take -out and delivery sales of liquor . 
(P.L. 2021 chapter 514.)  The following comments are offered for your consideration. 
 Evidence show s that when access to age- restricted products like alcohol increases, misuse and 
underage use increase, too. It is also known that the less effort an individual must put in to obtaining a substance such as alcohol, the more likely they are to use it.
i Alcohol misuse is 
already a longstanding public health concern, with Maine’s binge drinking rates among the highest in the nation,
ii and we have observed that the COVID -19 stay at home orders made it 
worse. Initial studies and data from 2020 show increased da ily and risky alcohol use, increased 
rates in alcohol related injuries, emergency room visits, deaths, and increased alcohol sales.iii 
Younger adults, minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers experienced disproportionately worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use, and higher rates of suicide ideation as a result of COVID -19.
iv Additional data also shows the  following:  
• In 2021, 667 Mainers died due to an alcohol related cause (disease or poisoning); this is a 
47% increase since 2019. There were 88 more alcohol related deaths in 2021 than 
reported in 2020, and 295 more deaths than in 2016; a 79% increase.v 
 
 • April 2020, shortly af ter COVID -19 began, the percentage of crashes related to impaired 
driving in Maine peaked at 50% higher than they had been in April 2019. Rates of 
impaired driving crashes remained consistently higher in 2021, with adults ages 21 – 44 representing impaired  crashes  roughly 25% higher than they were before the pandemic.
vi 
• According to a national study, 32% of participants reported binge drinking during stay- at-
home orders, with 60% of those indicating they had increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic . Non -binge drinkers increased their consumption by 28%. 
vii 
As has been discussed in several forums in regard to this policy, we do not yet have a solid bank 
of enforcement data on whether our liquor license agencies, law enforcement teams working on 
the E nforcement of Underaged Drinking Laws (EUDL) , or even liquor licensees themselves 
have the training and capacity to maintain liquor laws as intended to safeguard youth and the 
general public from misuse, tragedy, cancer, fetal alcohol exposure, addiction, and other consequences from unchecked and unmonitored use of this substance. Last year , the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs  committee voted to amend the  date that would repeal sections of Title 28  to 
give BABLO and i ts affiliates until 2025 to collect data and truly report on the magnitude of 
harms this increased access could cause. This breathing room to gain a more robust understanding of the  public health  impact s of increased access  would benefit the health and 
wellb eing of every single Mainer.  
 Weakened restrictions are undeniably linked to increased underaged alcohol use. Alcohol use before reaching the minimum age of 21 disrupts brain development, can cause social and family issues, and significantly increases the  chance to develop alcohol use disorder in their lifetime. 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health data indicates that underaged alcohol use in Maine is higher than the national average. One in five Maine high school students report using alcohol in the las t 30 days.
viii More than one in ten high schoolers reported driving after they had used 
alcohol. One third of Maine middle schoolers and six out of ten Maine high schoolers report that alcohol would be easy to get if they wanted it, which we know makes those  youth as much as 
three times more likely to consume alcohol
ix. The factors of the pandemic have unsteadied the 
mental health of most, and there is a statistical link between poor mental health and a risk for substance use, especially for individuals who a re in recovery or are underaged. Increasing access 
to alcohol through home delivery and take -out options at a time of declining mental health has 
the potential to worsen alcohol use consequences, relapses , and inhibited brain development.  
 In the short ti meframe that these changes to alcohol policy have been in place, they have proven 
challenging if not impossible to enforce. Curbside and home delivery of alcohol has limited infrastructure in place to ensure that IDs are being checked and alcohol is not be ing provided to 
minors. Youth are as much as three times more likely to attempt drinking alcohol if they do not believe they will be caught.
x Even before the pandemic, non- compliance with home delivery was 
documented by researchers as a serious concern fo r increased youth access to alcohol. In one 
study, almost half of underage buyers were able to order and receive alcohol with age 
verification being conducted inconsistently or ineffectively.xi The National Liquor Law 
Enforcement Association reports that l ow compliance for checking ID in alcohol sales was a 
nationwide concern before the pandemic, and Maine BABLO currently has only 7 liquor law 
enforcement agents to enforce liquor  laws across Maine’s thousands of liquor licensees. A level 
of enforcement supports this low guarantees that some public health risks go without 
 
 interception. Compliance check data from 2021/2022 suggest that sales to minors from licensed 
establishments are continuing to occur at a rate higher than pr e – pandemic levels . 
 It is our understanding that there is a request to carry this bill over until next year. We support this proposal, as it will give us additional information and data related to enforcement.   Thank you for your consideration of this matter and for the opportunity to provide testimony today. I can address questions from Committee and I will be available to participate in the work session.

Statewide Alcohol Retail Licensee Compliance Checks   
FY18 -FY23  
 
This program is funded  through  Maine  CDC’s Enforc ing Underaged Drinking Laws  (EUDL) Contract  and 
allows law enforcement officers through contracts with a vendor ( currently Dirigo Safety LLC, with CEO 
Scot Mattox) to earn overtime pay conducting important retail compliance checks in accordance with 
liquor law . Officers follow an order of operation s to select a youth volunteer who meet s the 
requi rements and attempt s to purchase alcohol from a randomly selected licensee under law 
enforcement supervision. Data presented in the table below show the outcomes  of these checks from 
fiscal years 2018 – 2023; fiscal years run July 1 to June 30 .   
 
 LICENSEES CHECKE D VIOLATIONS  FAILURE RATE  
FY2018  1,767   162 9.2%  
FY2019  1,911   122 6.4%   
FY2020  807  238  29.5%  
FY2021  1737  285  16.4%  
FY2022  2,728  381  14.6% 
FY2023  (July - Dec)  821 118 14.4%  
 
It should be noted th at no compliance checks were conducted  in April, May, and most of June  of FY2020  
due to shutdowns of non -essential businesses . The failure rate has increased markedly since the 
pandemic, with nearly 30% of  sales in FY2020 found to not properly check youth for ID. While things 
have improved since FY2020 , there are still  almost  three times as many failures as there were pre-
pandemic .  
 
One significant change in alcohol sales occurred in FY2020 when an Executive Order all owed 
establishments to sell cocktails to -go and to conduct retail sales curbside.  This was in response to the 
COVID -19 pandemic to help businesses economically as well as to limit contact to prevent the spread of 
COVID -19.  Compliance checks conducted in FY2020 through current  fiscal year  investigate both more 
traditional alcohol sales as well as expanded sales options.  
 
In FY2020, compliance checks  were conducted  on seven licensees operating under the expanded 
authority allowed by the Executive Order.  T hree of the seven checks uncover ed an ID violation , making 
the failure rate in curbside /to-go sales nearly 43%. In FY2021, a  total of 27 curbside/ to-go compliance 
checks  were done. Five of the 27 uncovered an ID violation for a failure rate of 18.5 %. In FY202 3, a total 
of 2 curbside/to -go compliance checks have been conducted , with no failed inspection s yet .
