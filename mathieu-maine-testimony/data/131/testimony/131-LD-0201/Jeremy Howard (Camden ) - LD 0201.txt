LD 201
Barren's Distillery is in favor of L.D. 201. It's a simple measure to help Craft 
Distilleries such as ours to keep pace with other beverage producers. Our location is 
on the docks of Camden Harbor where we have a high volume of boaters who enjoy 
the option of cocktails to-go to enjoy at their next destination. It increases our revenue
stream but more importantly, allows us to showcase our Maine-Grown spirits and 
mixers instead of these customers purchasing 'Ready-to-drink' (RTD's) canned 
cocktails at any liquor outlet.
