Dear Senator Craig Hickman  and Representative Christopher Caiazzo ,  
 
 Sonder & Dram, a small, upscale cocktail bar in Lewiston, is in support of enacting LD 201.  This 
liquor legislation would enable our small  business to continue  offering  to-go cocktail sales, and in turn, 
benefit the community we serve here in the second -largest metro area in Maine and be yond  
communities .  
Sonder & Dram creates high -end, craft cocktails . The demand for craft cocktails is currently 
booming and continues to grow across Maine and across the country. With the increase of work -from -
home lifestyles  from COVID, more and more peop le are still looking for ways to enjoy  cocktails at home. 
Supporting this demand is only possible if the legislature supports LD 201 in favor of Maine businesses.  
In addition to to -go cocktail  consumption, this legislation supports the growth of beverage 
industry businesses across Maine. Offering to -go cocktails to  our loyal customer base is an opportunity 
to support our business, enjoy a craft cocktail in many of the great places across Maine.  
By supporting this legislation, the committee would continue to support  businesses across 
Maine and ensure they continue  to make revenue that is otherwise missed. We ask that you vote in 
favor of this bill, and in favor of Maine service industry businesses.  
 
Signed,  
Blaine Flanders, Operations Director
