Testimony of Maine Public Health Association  in Opposition to : 
LD 201: An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers and Distilleries to Sell Liquor for 
Off-premises Consumption and Cocktails for On- premises Consumption  
 
Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs  
State House, Room 437 Monday, January 30, 202 3 
 Good morning, Senator Hickman , Representative Supica , and distinguished members of the Joint Standing 
Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs . My name is Rebecca Boulos . I am a resident of South Portland and 
executive director of Maine Public Health Association.  MPHA is the state’s oldest, largest, and most diverse association for public health professionals. We represent more than 700 individual members and 60 organizations a cross the state. The mission of MPHA is to improve 
and sustain the health and well -being of all people in Maine through health promotion, disease prevention, and 
the advancement of health equity. As a statewide nonprofit association, we advocate, act, and advise on critical 
public health challenges, aiming to improve the policies, systems, and environments that underlie health 
inequities – but  which also have potential to improve health outcomes for all people in Maine. We are not tied 
to a national agenda,  which means we are responsive to the needs of Maine’s communities , and we take that 
responsibility seriously.  MPHA opposes LD 201: “ An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers and Distilleries to Sell 
Liquor for Off -premises Consumption and Cocktails for On- premises Consumption.” This bill would make  
permanent pandemic- related provisions that allow qualified retailers  to sell beer, wine, and cocktails for off -
premise s consumption. While we realize these provisions were made to support businesses during the 
pandemic , we have concerns about the public health impacts of maintaining this provision, including direct 
associations with  alcohol consumption and consequential health effects, and enforcement limitations . 
 Alcohol Use During the Pa ndemic  
Nationwide, t otal alcohol sales outside of bars and restaurants increased by 24% during the pandemic , with 
sales of spirits with higher alcohol content rising  fastest (greater  than 27% increase over the last year ). In the 
month of September 2020, na tionwide online alcohol sales were up 256% compared to 2019.
1 In Maine, 
according to data from the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) , alcohol  sales increased 17 % 
from 2019 to 2021 and 42% since 2016 (i n contrast, the estimated economic burden of excess alcohol use in 
Maine was nearly $1 billion dollars in 2010) . 
 These increased sales translate to increased consumption. N ational study data show 32% of participants 
reported binge drinking during stay- at-home orders, with 60% of those  indicating they increased alcohol 
consumption during the pandemic. Non- binge drinkers increased their consumption by 28%.
2 In Maine, data 
show that a lcohol is the substance most often used across the lifespan, especially in youth and young adults. 
Accord ing to recent survey data, nearly one third (32.4%) of Maine people  ages 18 -25 years report binge 
drinking in the past 30 days – one of the highest rates in the nation.3 Moreover , 1 in 2 high school students feel 
122 State Street, Augusta, ME 04330 • 207- 808-0487 • mainepublichealth.org  it is easy to get alcohol. High school students that thought alcohol was easy to obtain were nearly 4x as likely to 
drink alcohol within the past month.4 
 
According to the SEOW , there has been increased daily and risky alcohol use, increased  rates in alcohol -related 
injuries, emergency room visits, and deaths  (see at tached fact sheet) . The  immediate consequences of changing 
alcohol use patterns include  increases in alcohol -related emergencies such as alcohol withdrawal, withdrawal -
related suicides, methanol toxicity, and alcohol -related motor vehicle crashes.5 Moreover, data suggest people 
with alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk of developing severe COVID -19, compared to people 
without AUD.6 
 Enforcement  
In the short timeframe that these changes to alcohol policy have been in place, they have proven challenging, if 
not impossible, to enforce. Existing  enforcement infrastructure for curbside and home delivery i s limited for 
ensuring IDs are checked and alco hol is not being provided to minors . Currently, Maine has seven  liquor 
enforcement agents to  cover the entire state. In 202 1, there were 4,625 retailers in Maine with liquor licenses – 
representing a 117% increase since 2013. The most common types of complaints from states that have conducted compliance checks on home delivery include : Alcohol left on doorstep; delivered to minor; did not 
check ID; checked ID but provided alcohol anyways; delivery driver swiped own ID to bypass the system; did not know alcohol was in order. These complaints are indicative of a market that has potential for reduced regulation and increased access, specifically among young people in Maine. 
 
Even before the pandemic, non- compliance with home delivery was documented by researchers as a serious 
concern for increased youth access to alcohol. In one study, almost half of underage buyers were able to order 
and receive alcohol with age verification being conducted inconsistently or ineffectively.7 When access to age-
restricted products like alcohol increases,  misuse , and underage  use increase, too.8 
 Recommendations  
To date, t hese changes to the law have been  associated with an increase in consumption, alcohol -related 
damages, and increased pressure on very limited enforcement capacity. The public health effects of the changes proposed in this bill increase soc ial and health care costs, which effectively erase the tax revenue gained from 
product sales.9 Indeed, t here are no data to  suggest that increasing sales of and access to alcohol confers 
economic gains to Maine. Conducting an analytic review of which  state service resources are expended in 
response to alcohol use outcomes, such as response from law enforcement, EMS, OCFS intervention, calls to 
the crisis hotline, charges to  MaineCare, and others, would be helpful for determ ining the actual cost -benefit to 
the state . 
 We understand there has been a request to carry over this bill  until next year ; we are supportive  of that request. 
Thank you for your consideration.

The p roportion of 
emergency department 
(ED) visits related to alcohol 
steeply increased at the 
start of the pandemic  and 
peaked between April and 
June of 2020 (4.0 %). The 
overall number of alcohol 
related ED visits remains 
high with 19, 602 in 2020  
and 19,480 in 2021 ; this 
equates to more than two  
alcohol -related ED  visits 
every hou r.6 
 
 Alcohol misuse is a public health concern  that became  worse  
during the COVID -19 pandemic . Data show that access to alcohol in  
Maine has steadily increased along with associated death, injuries , 
and diseases. This brief provides information and context for  
alcohol use  in Maine during  the pandemic and beyond .

Preliminary data from 2021  show that 667 Mainers d ied due to an alcohol 
related cause  (disease or poisoning) ; this is a 47% increase since 2019 . 
There were 88 more alcohol related deaths in 2021 than reported in 2020, 
and 295 more deaths than in 2016 ; a 79% increase.5  
Alcohol is the most widely used substance in Maine  and can have 
harmful impact s on society, including motor vehicle crashe s, 
crime,  chronic disease,  straining health/medical resources, and 
lowering work productivity. It is the manner and frequency with 
which people use alcohol and/or  other substances  that are often 
linked to substanc e-related consequences.3 
 
 A study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
found that d eaths due to alcohol increase d 25% between 2019 and 
2020.1 It is projected that around 8,000 additional deaths will occur 
nationally  due to increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic , 
however t he full impact of increased alcohol consumption during the 
pandemic is  currently  unknow n. Projected d eaths are attributed  
 to 18,700 more  cases of liver failure and 1,000 more
