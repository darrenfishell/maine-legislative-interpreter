Nina June Restaurant
LD 201
As a restaurant owner who has so far made it through COVID I would just like to 
affirm the general helpfulness of being able to sell cocktails and wine at retail to my 
customers.  While its not a huge source of income it is yet another source which is 
helpful especially during the winter months.  It seems obvious that since 2020 when 
this was first allowed there have been no great problems  with allowing retail sales 
with a food purchase
