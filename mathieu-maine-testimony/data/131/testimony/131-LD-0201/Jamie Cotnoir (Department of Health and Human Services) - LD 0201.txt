Testimony of the

Department of Health and Human Services 
Before the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 
In Opposition to LD 2014 
An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers and Distilleries to Sell Liquor for 
Off-premises Consumption and Cocktails for On-premises Consumption 
Sponsored by: Senator Bradlee Farrin 
Hearing Date: January 30, 2023 
Senator Hickman, Representative Supica, and members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs, my name is Jamie Cotnoir. l am the division director for Disease 
Prevention at the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. I am here today to provide 
testimony on behalf of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to express our 
concerns with LD 201, An Act to Make Permanent the Ability of Certain Retailers and 
Distilleries to Sell Liquor for Oﬂ-premises Consumption and Cocktails for On-premises 
Consumption. 
This bill makes permanent the changes to the liquor laws amended by Public Law 2021, chapters 
3 and 91, allowing qualiﬁed on-premises retailers and qualiﬁed distilleries to sell liquor for off- 
prernise consumption under certain conditions and the sale of cocktails for on-premise 
consumption at distilleries and ‘small distilleries. LD 201 removes the 2025 effective date of the 
repeal of certain provisions authorized by these laws for take-out and delivery sales of liquor. 
(P.L. 2021 chapter 514.) The following comments are offered for your consideration. 
Evidence shows that when access to age-restricted products like alcohol increases, misuse and 
underage use increase, too. It is also known that the less effort an individual must put in to 
obtaining a substance such as alcohol, the more likely they are to use it.i Alcohol misuse is 
already a longstanding public health concern, with Maine’s binge drinking rates among the 
highest in the nation)‘ and we have observed that the COVlD- 19 stay at home orders made it 
Worse. Initial studies and data ﬁrom 2020 show increased daily and risky alcohol use, increased 
rates in alcohol related injuries, emergency room visits, deaths, and increased alcohol sales.“ 
Younger adults, minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers experienced 
disproportionately Worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use, and higher rates of 
suicide ideation as a result of COVTD-19.i" Additional data also shows the following: 
0 In 2021, 667 Mainers died due to an alcohol related cause (disease or poisoning); this isa 
47% increase since 2019. There were 88 more alcohol related deaths in 2021 than 
reported in 2020, and 295 more deaths than in 2016; a 79% increase."
0 April 2020, shortly after COVID-19 began, the percentage of crashes related to impaired 
driving in Maine peaked at 50% higher than they had been in April 2019. Rates of 
impaired driving crashes remained consistently higher in 2021, with adults ages 21 — 44 
representing impaired crashes roughly 25% higher than they were before the pandemic. “ 
~ According to a national study, 32% of participants reported binge drinking during stay-at- 
home orders, With 60% of those indicating they had increased alcohol consumption 
during the pandemic. Non-binge drinkers increased their consumption by 28%. vii 
As has been discussed in several forums in regard to this policy, We do not yet have a solid bank 
of enforcement data on Whether our liquor license agencies, law enforcement teams Working on 
the Enforcement of Underaged Drinking Laws (EUDL), or even ‘liquor licensees themselves 
have the training and capacity to maintain liquor laws as intended to safeguard youth and the 
general public from misuse, tragedy, cancer, fetal alcohol exposure, addiction, and other 
consequences ﬁ'om unchecked and unmonitored use of this substance. Last year, the Veterans 
and Legal Affairs committee voted to amend the date that would repeal sections of Title 28 to 
give BABLO and its affiliates until 2025 to collect data and truly report on the magnitude of 
harms this increased access could cause. This breathing room to gain a more robust 
understanding of the public health impacts of increased access would beneﬁt the health and 
Wellbeing of every single Mainer. 
Weakened restrictions are undeniably linked to increased underaged alcohol use. Alcohol use 
before reaching the minimum ageof 21 disrupts brain development, can cause social and family 
issues, and signiﬁcantly increases the chance to develop alcohol use disorder in their lifetime. 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health data indicates that underaged alcohol use in Maine is 
higher than the national average. One in ﬁve Maine high school students report using alcohol in 
the last 30 days.”iﬁ More than one in ten high schoolers reported driving after theyhad used 
alcohol. One third of Maine middle schoolers and six out of ten Maine high schoolers report that 
alcohol would be easy to get if they Wanted it, which We know makes those youth as much as 
three times more likely to consume alcoholix . The factors of the pandemic have unsteadied the 
mental health of most, and there is a statistical link between poor mental health and a risk for 
substance use, especially for individuals Who are in recovery or are underaged. Increasing access 
to alcohol through home delivery and take-out options at a time of declining mental health has 
the potential to worsen alcohol use consequences, relapses, and inhibited brain development. 
In the short timeframe that these changes to alcohol policy have been in place, they have proven 
challenging if not impossible to enforce. Curbside and home delivery of alcohol has limited 
infrastructure in place to ensure that lDs are being checked’ and alcohol is not being provided to 
minors. Youth are as much as three times more likely to attempt drinking alcohol if they do not 
believe they will be caught." Even before the pandemic, non-compliance with home delivery was 
documented by researchers as a serious concem for increased youth access to alcohol. In one 
study, almost half of underage buyers were able to order and receive alcohol with age 
veriﬁcation being conducted inconsistently or ineffectivelyfd The National Liquor Law 
Enforcement Association reports that low compliance for checking ID in alcohol sales Wasa 
nationwide concern before the pandemic, and Maine BABLO currently has only 7 liquor law 
enforcement agents to enforce liquor laws across Maine’s thousands of liquor licensees. A level 
of enforcement supports this low guarantees that some public health risks go Without
interception. Compliance check data ﬁtom 2021/2022 suggest that sales to minors from licensed 
establishments are continuing to occur at a rate higher than pre — pandemic levels. 
It is our understanding that there is a request to carry this bill over until next year. We support 
this proposal, as it will give us additional information and data related to enforcement. 
Thank you for your consideration of this matter and for the opportunity to provide testimony ’ 
today. I can address questions from Committee and I will be available to participate in the Work 
session.

Statewide Alcohol Retail Licensee Compliance Checks 
FY18-FY23 
This program is funded through Maine CDC’s Enforcing Underaged Drinking Laws (EUDL) Contract and 
allows law enforcement officers through contracts with a vendor (currently Dirigo Safety LLC, with CEO 
Scot Mattox) to earn overtime pay conducting important retail compliance checks in accordance with 
liquor law. Officers follow an order of operations to select a youth volunteer who meets the 
requirements and attempts to purchase alcohol from a randomly selected licensee under law 
enforcement supervision. Data presented in the table below show the outcomes of these checks from 
fiscal years 2018 — 2023; fiscal years run July 1 to June 30.

lt should be noted that no compliance checks were conducted in April, May, and most of June of FY2020 
due to shutdowns of non—essential businesses. The failure rate has increased markedly since the T " __“ 
pandemic, with nearly 30% of sales in FY2020 found to not properly check youth for ID. While things 
have improved since FY2020, there are still almost three times as many failures as there were pre- 
pandemic. 
One significant change in alcohol sales occurred in FY2020 when an Executive Order allowed 
establishments to sell cocktails to-go and to conduct retail sales curbside. This was in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic to help businesses economically as well as to limit contact to prevent the spread of 
COVID-19. Compliance checks conducted in FY2020 through current fiscal year investigate both more 
traditional alcohol sales as well as expanded sales options. 
In FY2020, compliance checks were conducted on seven licensees operating under the expandedmms 
authority allowed by the Executive Order. Three of the seven checks uncovered an ID violation, making 
the failure rate in curbside/to-go sales nearly 43%. ln FY2021, a total of 27 curbside/to-go compliance 
checks were done. Five of the 27 uncovered an ID violation for a failure rate of 18.5%. In FY2023, a total 
of 2 curbside/to —go compliance checks have been conducted, with no failed inspections yet.
