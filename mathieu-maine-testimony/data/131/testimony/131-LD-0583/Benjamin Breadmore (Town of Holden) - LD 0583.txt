RE: LD 583 
To Whom It May Concern, 
I Write to you today in support of LD5 83, this is a recurring request from resident 
owner/ operators within our community. There is time for tradition to be respected and 
upheld and a time to think to the future. If our state has employees that are willing to 
work and provide a service to the residents of Maine, why would we wish to stand in 
their way. A holiday shift could pay for a child’s birthday party, extra heating oil, 
groceries, or even the ability to squirl away for a rainy day we all know is coming. 
I humbly request you support this initiative and my apologies for not being in person to 
relay this sentiment. 
Tharrleyo ,
