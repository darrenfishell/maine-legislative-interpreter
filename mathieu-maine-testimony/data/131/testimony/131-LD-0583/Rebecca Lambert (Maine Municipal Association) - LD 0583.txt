Neither for Nor Against   
LD 583 - An Act To  Provide for Municipalities To Allow Grocery Stores up to 10,000 Square Feet 
To Open on Thanksgiving, Easter and Christmas  
February 28, 2023  
 
 
Senator Curry , Representative Roberts  and members of the Innovation, Development, 
Economic Advancement and Business Committee , my name is Rebecca Lambert and I am 
providing testimony neither for nor against LD 583 on behalf of Maine Municipal Association’s (MMA) elected 70 -member Legislative Policy Committee (LPC). For clarity, the LPC provides 
direction to the advocacy team at MMA and establishes the position on bills of municipal interest.    
 Since 2003, retailers with fewer than 5,000 square feet of interior space have had the 
ability to open their doors on Sundays and holidays. To members of the LPC , this square footage -
based distinction seems arbitrary and unnecessary , particularly when applied to grocery stores 
of less than 10,000 (and as amended 12,000) square feet .  
 
Simply put, the LPC believes  state statutes should be modernized to fit with today’ s reality 
more appropriately , rather than leaving it to each community to resolve the discrepancy via the 
adoption of ordinances.   
 
Thank you for your time and consideration of the municipal perspective on this issue.
