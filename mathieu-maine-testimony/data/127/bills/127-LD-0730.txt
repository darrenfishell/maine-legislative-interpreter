 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes several technical and clarifying changes to Maine's marine resources 2 
laws.  The bill:  3 
1. Elim inates the requirement to record a research or aquaculture lease in the county 4 
registry of deeds;  5 
2. Clarifies that a student lobster and crab fishing license holder may designate up to 6 
3 sponsors;  7 
3. Deletes the Kittery lobster trawl limit from statute.  All other trawl limits are in 8 
department rule;  9 
4.  Clarifies that a student lobster and crab fishing license holder must declare a 10 
lobster management zone and may not fish a majority of the license holder's gear outside 11 
the declared zone;  12 
5.  Provides that  the coordinates for the Swans Island Lobster Conservation Area are 13 
presented in latitude and longitude format and not Loran format;  14 
6.  Allows nonresidents who hold aquaculture leases or limited -purpose aquaculture 15 
licenses to be issued commercial shellfi sh licenses. Current law restricts commercial 16 
shellfish licenses to Maine residents;  17 
7. Eliminates the limited wholesale shellfish harvester's license; and  18 
8.  Clarifies the method for closing a municipal flat to depuration harvesting when the 19 
municipality  is conducting pollution abatement activities.  20
