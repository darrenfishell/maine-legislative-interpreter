This bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Judicial Department of $460,868 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$614,492 in fiscal year 2016-17 to increase juror mileage reimbursement froni 15¢ per mile to the rate specified for 
state employees, currently 44¢ per mile, and to increase the per diem rate paid to jurors from $10 to $20. 
The Governor's proposed biennial budget for 2016-2017 contains $160,312 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $454,179 in 
fiscal year 2016-17 to increase juror mileage reimbursement from 15¢ per mile to the rate specified for state 
employees, currently 44¢ per mile, beginning in the 2nd year of the biennium, fiscal year 2016-17, and to increase the 
per diem rate paid to jurors from $10 to $15. This bill is in conflict with the proposed biennial budget and may need to 
be revisited after final legislative action on that budget.
