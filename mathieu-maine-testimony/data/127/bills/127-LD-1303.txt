determination of the amount of the claim and award is binding in any subsequent 29 
action for reimbursement to the fund.  If a claimant has not been compensated for 30

E.  Awards from the fund on damage claims may not include any amount the 8 
claimant has recovered, on account of the same damage, by way of settlement with 9

of competent jurisdiction against the responsible party to the extent these amounts are 11

suffered by the claimant as a result of a discharge of oil.  Reasonable measures 14 
include title searches and site assessments for the acquisition of commercial or 15 
industrial properties.  16 
G.  The remedies provided for 3rd -party damage claims compensated under this 17

when the claimant is a publicly owned or operated public water system . 24 
I.  A 3rd -party damage claim for damages to real estate may not include the 25 
devaluation of the re al estate associated with the loss of a water supply if the 26 
commissioner finds under section 548 or section 568, subsection 2  that a public or 27 
private water supply is available and if that water supply best meets the criteria of 28 
that section and the proper ty owner did not agree to be served by that public or 29 
private water supply.  If a water supply well is installed after October 1, 1994 to serve 30 
a location that immediately before the well installation was served by a viable 31 
community public water system, a nd the well is or becomes contaminated with oil:  32 
(1)  A 3rd party may not recover damages under this subchapter for expenses 33 
incurred in treating or replacing the well if the well is installed in an area 34 
delineated as contaminated as provided in section 54 8, subsection 1; and  35 
(2)  A 3rd -party damage claim under this subchapter with regard to treatment or 36 
replacement of the well is limited to reimbursement of the expense of installing 37 
the well and its proper abandonment if the well is installed in any other area.  38 
For purposes of this paragraph, "viable community public water system" has the same 39 
meaning as in section 548.  40 
J.  A claimant is not eligible for compensation under this subsection for costs, 41 
expenses or damages related to a discharge if the commissi oner determines that the 42 
claimant is a responsible party as defined under section 542, subsection 9 -C. 43 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR0536(01) -1 
 K.  Prior to forwarding a claim to the hearing examiner under subsection 3 -A, the 1 
commissioner may require that the amount of the claim be finalized.  2 
L.  Third -party damage claims may not include expenditures for the preparation and 3 
prosecution of the damage claim, such as legal fees or real estate appraisal fees.  4 
M.  The commissioner may dismiss a 3rd -party damage claim for untimely filing, for 5 
failure by  the claimant to provide the information necessary to process the claim 6 
within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice that the claim is insufficient 7 
for processing or for ineligibility as determined by the commissioner under paragraph 8 
J.  A dis missal may be appealed to Superior Court in accordance with Title 5, chapter 9 
375, subchapter 7.  10 
2-B.  Claimant contact.   When the commissioner becomes aware of a claimant 11 
under subsection 2, the commissioner shall send a letter by certified mail to inform that 12 
person of the 3rd -party damage claims process under subsection 2.  The letter must 13 
contain the name and telephone number of a contact person available to explain the 14 
claims procedure.  15 
3-A.  Determination of disputed 3rd -party damage claims.   The commi ssioner 16 
shall establish a disputed claims processing capability within the department to hear and 17 
determine claims filed under this subchapter that are not agreed upon by the claimant and 18 
the commissioner and any responsible party who has joined as an inte rested party.  19 
A.  An independent hearing examiner appointed by the commissioner shall hear and 20 
determine any disputed 3rd -party damage claims.  The parties to the hearing are the 21 
commissioner and the claimant.  22 
B.  To the extent practical, all claims arisin g from or related to a common discharge 23 
must be heard and determined by the same hearing examiner.  24 
C.  Hearings before the hearing examiner are informal and the rules of evidence 25 
applicable to judicial proceedings are not binding.  The hearing examiner may  26 
administer oaths and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses 27 
and the production of books, records and other evidence relative or pertinent to the 28 
issues presented to the hearing examiner for determination.  29 
D.  Determinations made by the hearing examiner are final and those determinations 30 
may be subject to review by a Justice of the Superior Court, but only as to matters 31 
related to abuse of discretion by the hearing examiner.  The party seeking review of a 32 
hearing examiner's determinat ion must file an appeal in the Superior Court within 30 33 
days of the determination.  Determinations made by the hearing examiner must be 34 
accorded a presumption of regularity and validity in a subsequent reimbursement 35 
action, but this presumption may be rebu tted by responsible parties.  36 
E.  The commissioner shall certify the amount of the damage award, if any, after 37 
determination by the hearing examiner and shall certify the name of the claimant to 38 
the Treasurer of State.  39

computed at 15% a year from the date of ex penditure, unless the department finds the 24 
amount involved too small, the likelihood of success too uncertain or that recovery of 25 
costs is unlikely due to the inability of the responsible party to pay those costs, provided  26 
except  that recoveries resulting from damage due to an oil pollution disaster declared by 27 
the Governor pursuant to section 547 must be apportioned between the Maine Coastal 28 
and Inland Surface Oil Clean -up Fund  fund and the General Fund so as to repay the full 29 
costs to the General Fund of any bonds issued as a result of the disaster:  30 
A.  All disbursements made by the fund pursuant to subsection 5, paragraphs A, B, D, 31

Requests for reimbursement to the fund, if not paid within 30 days of demand, may be 3 
turned over to the Attorney G eneral for collection or may be submitted to a collection 4 
agency or agent or an attorney retained by the department with the approval of the 5 
Attorney General in conformance with Title 5, section 191, or the department may file 6 
suit in District Court.  The commissioner may file claims with appropriate federal 7 
agencies to recover for the use of the fund all disbursements from the fund in connection 8 
with a prohibited discharge.  9 
Requests for reimbursement to the fund for disbursements pursuant to subsection 5, 10 
paragraph B, if not paid within 60 days of demand, are subject to a penalty not to exceed 11 
twice the total amount of reimbursement requested.  This penalty is in addition to the 12

6-A.  Lien.   All costs incurred by the State in the removal, abatement and 14 
remediation of a prohibited discharge of oil , all costs incurred by the State in the 15 
abandonment of an underground oil storage facility or tank under section 566 -A, 16 
subsec tion 4  and interest are a lien against the real estate of the responsible party.  The 17 
lien does not apply to the real estate of a licensee if the discharge was caused or suffered 18 
by a carrier destined for the licensee's facilities.  For a responsible party  determined 19 
eligible for coverage under section 568 -A, subsection 1, the lien is for the amount of any 20 
unpaid deductible assigned under section 568 -A, subsection 2 and any eligible clean -up 21 
costs and 3rd -party damage claims above $750,000, or above $1,000, 000 for underground 22 
oil storage facilities.  23 
A certificate of lien signed by the commissioner must be sent by certified mail to the 24 
responsible party prior to being recorded and may be filed in the office of the clerk of the 25 
municipality in which the real e state is located.  The lien is effective when the certificate 26 
is recorded with the registry of deeds for the county in which the real estate is located.  27 
The certificate of lien must include a description of the real estate, the amount of the lien 28 
and the name of the owner as grantor.  29 
When the amount for which a lien has been recorded under this subsection has been paid 30 
or reduced, the commissioner, upon request by any person of record holding interest in 31 
the real estate that is the subject of the lien, sha ll issue a certificate discharging or 32 
partially discharging the lien.  The certificate must be recorded in the registry in which 33 
the lien was recorded.  Any action of foreclosure of the lien must be brought by the 34 
Attorney General in the name of the State in the Superior Court for the judicial district in 35 
which the real estate subject to the lien is located.  36 
7.  Waiver of reimbursement.   Upon petition of any licensee, the board may, after 37 
hearing, waive the right to reimbursement to the fund if it finds tha t the occurrence was 38 
the result of any of the following:  39 
A.  An act of war;  40 
B.  An act of government, either state, federal or municipal, except insofar as the act 41 
was pursuant to section 548; or  42 
 
 Page 13 - 127LR0536(01) -1 
 C.  An act of God, which means an unforeseeable act exclusi vely occasioned by the 1 
violence of nature without the interference of any human agency.  2 
Upon such finding by the board, immediate credit therefor must be entered for the party 3 
involved. The findings of the board are conclusive as it is the legislative inte nt that waiver 4 
provided in this subsection is a privilege conferred, not a right granted.  5 
8.  Disbursements to state agencies.   A state agency that seeks reimbursement from 6 
the Maine Coastal and Inland Surface Oil Clean -up Fund  fund for costs incurred in 7 
undertaking oil spill response activities shall keep time records demonstrating the amount 8 
of spill response activities performed for which reimbursement is sought.  A state agency 9 
may establish a dedicated account for receipt of disbursements from the fund .  10 
Disbursements from the fund to a state agency pursuant to subsection 5, paragraph B 11 
must be deposited in that account, if it has been established, and may be used by the 12 
agency to support its activities.  13
