 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the enactment of unfunded education mandates and other provisions of 3 
federal and state edu cation laws may result in adverse fiscal effects on school 4 
administrative units in the State, which are obligated to implement the new federal or 5 
state requirements without receiving the funding necessary to do so; and  6 
Whereas, the economic consequences of  the recent economic recession have 7 
reduced the amount of Federal Government and State Government revenues that are 8 
available to support the operations of public schools in the State and have affected the 9 
ability of local property taxpayers to bear the fin ancial burden of unfunded education 10 
mandates on school administrative units in the State; and  11 
Whereas, the work group established in this resolve must begin its work as soon as 12 
possible in order to examine unfunded mandates and bureaucratic impediments ide ntified 13 
in a number of reports and determine which ones should be addressed as a matter of 14 
priority; and  15
