terms have the following meanings.  6 
(1)  "Maximum allowable cost" means the maximum amount that a pharmacy 7 
benefits manager pays toward the cost of a prescripti on drug.  8 
(2)  "Nationally available" means available to all pharmacies in this State for 9

obsolete or temporarily available.  11 
(3)  "Therapeutically equivalent drug substitute" means a prescription drug 12 
identified as therapeutically or pharmaceutically equivalent to another 13 
prescription drug as evidenced by an "A" code in the most recent version of the 14 
United States Food and Drug Administration's "Approved Drug Products with 15 
Therapeuti c Equivalence Evaluations," also known as "the Orange Book," or an 16 
equivalent rating from a successor publication.  17 
B.  A pharmacy benefits manager may set a maximum allowable cost for a 18 
prescription drug, or allow a prescription drug to continue on a maxim um allowable 19 
cost list, only if that prescription drug is nationally available and has 3 or more 20 
nationally available therapeutically equivalent drug substitutes with a significant cost 21 
difference.  22 
C.  A pharmacy benefits manager shall remove or modify a m aximum allowable cost 23 
for a prescription drug as necessary for the cost of the prescription drug to remain 24

timely fashion.  27 
D.  A pharmacy benefits manager shall disclose to a pharmacy for which the 28

and 5 
(4)  Whether the pharmacy benefits manager bills the carrier for a prescription 6 
drug an amount consistent with the maximum allowable cost for that drug used 7 
for reimbursing a pharmacy and, if the pharmacy benefits manager does not bill 8 
and reimburse consistent amounts, the difference between the amount billed and 9 
the amount reimbursed.  10 
F.  A pharmacy benefits manager shall provide a reasonable administrative app eal 11 
procedure, including a right to appeal that is limited to 60 days following the initial 12

(2)  The maximum allowable cost is below the pharmacy's acquisition cost.  16
