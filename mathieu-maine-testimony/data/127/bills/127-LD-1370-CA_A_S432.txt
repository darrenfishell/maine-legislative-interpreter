This amendment 
is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Education 
and Cultural Affairs and, like the bill, proposes to improve teacher quality in the State by 
amending the current statutes related to programs involving teacher preparation, support 
systems for provisional teachers, teacher certification, teacher salaries and college loans 
for students enrolled in a program of study leading to certification as a teacher. 
The amendment amends the provisions of the bill that expand the student teaching 
experience and academic achievement requirements for a provisional teacher certificate. 
The amendment specifies the number of hours of practicum an applicant must complete, 
clarifies the time frame during which the student teaching experience must occur and 
specifies that the grade point average requirement applies only to an applicant's teacher 
preparation course work. The bill increases to 24 the minimum number of weeks of 
student teaching experience an applicant must complete; the amendment retains the 
current requirement of 15 weeks. The amendment enacts a grade point average 
requirement with respect to applicants recommended by educational institutions offering 
teacher preparation programs.

31 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 502, L.D. 1370 
The amendment retains the provisions of the bill that strengthen the support systems 
required to provide assistance for provisional teachers during each year of their 
probationary period and that require the Commissioner of Education to pay salary 
supplements to teachers who are involved in the operation of such systems. 
The amendment removes the provision of the bill that requires an individual who is 
issued a teacher certificate on or after July 1, 2015 and has not completed a master's 
degree program to complete a master's degree program before the individual may have 
the individual's certificate renewed or be issued another certificate. 
The amendment provides that the provisions of the bill increasing the minimum 
salary for certified teachers to $40,000 apply beginning with the 2017-2018 school year 
and that the provisions of the bill that include in the school funding formula the state 
funding for the incremental costs of meeting this minimum apply beginning in fiscal year 
2017-18. The amendment removes the provision of the bill requiring the Commissioner 
of Education to pay the increased teacher retirement contributions resulting from the 
increase in minimum salary. 
The amendment removes the provision of the bill that requires the Department of 
Education to increase the qualifying scores for the standardized qualifying examinations 
for initial teacher certification. 
The amendment requires the State Board of Education to amend its rule Chapter 114: 
Purpose, Standards and Procedures for the Review and Approval of Preparation Programs 
for Education Personnel to articulate and outline clear standards for the memorandum of 
understanding between student teachers, teacher preparation programs and participating 
school administrative units. 
The amendment directs the Governor to appoint members to vacant positions on the

This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $250,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 to the 
Student Financial Assistance Program within the Finance Authority of Maine for the costs of doubling the amount of 
loans awarded to eligible students in the Educators for Maine Program. 
This legislation requires local school adminstrative units to increase the minimum salary for certified teachers to 
$40,000 beginning in the 2017-2018 school year. Although the actual cost can not be determined at this time, the 
estimated cost is expected to be approximately $12.2 million in fiscal year 2017-18 and $11.0 million in fiscal year 
2018-19. This estimate is derived by adjusting teacher salary data provided by the Department of Education for the 
2015-2016 school year for assumed cost-of-living increases of 1.6% per year and an estimated 75 new teachers hired 
at the current minimum salary of $30,000 per year. Because the language in the bill is not clear as to how salaries for 
part-time teachers is to be addressed, this fiscal note does not provide an estimated cost for these teachers. It also 
does not address the additional costs to local school administrative units to adjust salary schedules for certified 
teachers whose salaries will be above the $40,000 minimum in fiscal year 2017-18 when teachers whose salaries are 
below the $40,000 threshold will be increased to $40,000. 
Additionally, this requirement will increase the employer contribution for the normal cost component of the Maine 
Public Employers Retirement System (MainePERS) due to the increase in salaries. Because the contribution rate for 
the normal cost component for teachers for fiscal year 201 7-18 is not yet known, this fiscal note utilizes the rate for 
the 2016-2017 biennium of 3.36%. When this rate is applied to the projected increase in teacher salaries, the 
additional amount local school administrative units will have to pay to MainePERS for the normal cost of teacher 
retirement is estimated to be $409,880 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $370,225 in fiscal year 2018-19. 
LR0891(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
CA (~-lt32J 
This bill requires the Department of Education to determine the amount of state funds necessary to fund the increase 
in the minimum salary for teachers and report that amount to the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural 
Affairs no later than December 15, 2016 and provides that the committee shall report out a bill to the First Regular 
Session of the 128th Legislature to provide the necessary funding. Unless this funding is approved and enacted by the 
I 28th Legislature during the 1st Regular session, the full cost of this measure will be borne by local school 
administrative units. For any future fiscal year that the State chooses not to fund the additional cost of this minimum 
salary requirement, local school administrative units will be required to fund 100% of the cost.
