Amend the bill by striking out all of section 6 (page 4, lines 16 to 40, page 5, lines 1

§15683-B. Public charter schools; calculation of total allocation and state 
contribution 
I , 
Beginning with fiscal year 2015-16, this section applies to public charter schools 
authorized by the Maine Charter School Commission, established under Title 5, section 
12004-G, subsection 10-0, in accordance with the funding provisions established in 
section 2413-A. 
1. Calculation of EPS per-pupil rates. If there is only one school administrative 
unit sending students to a public charter school in a school year. the commissioner shaH 
use that resident school administrative unit's EPS per-pupil rate. If there is more than one 
school administrative unit sending students to the public charter school, the commissioner 
shall calculate a public charter school's EPS per-pupil rate for each year as follows. 
A. When there are elementary studl~nts from outside of a single resident school 
administrative unit sending students to an elementary public charter school. the EPS 
per-pupil rate for elementary grades is calculated by multiplying the number of 
students from a resident school administrative unit attending the public charter school 
by that resident school administrative unit's elementary EPS per-pupil rate to find the 
total cost for elementary students enrolled in the public charter school in that resident 
school administrative unit, then adding: the total cost for elementary students enrolled

I in the public charter school from each resident school administrative unit. The result 
2 is divided by the total number of elementary students in the public charter school. 
3 B. When there are secondary students from outside of a single resident school 
4 administrativ,e unit sending students to a secondary public charter school, the EPS 
5 per-pupil rate for secondary grades is calculated by mUltiplying the number of 
6 students from a resident school administrative unit attending the public charter school 
7 by that resident school administrative unit's secondary EPS per-pupil rate to find the 
8 total cost for secondary students enrolled in the public charter school in that resident 
9 school administrative unit, then adding the total cost for secondary students enrolled 
10 in the public charter school from each resident school administrative unit. The result 
11 is divided by the total number of secondary students in the public charter school.

17 school is determined by multiplying the number of students at the public charter 
18 school by the most recent available elementary free or reduced-price meals 
19 percentage for that public charter school. The elementary free or reduced-price meals 
20 percentage may be applied to determine the number of economically disadvantaged 
21 students in the public charter school secondary grades. If the public charter school 
22 does not operate elementary grades, the most recent available secondary free or 
23 reduced-price meals percentage must be used in place of the elementary free or 
24 reduced-price meals percentage. 
25 C. The number of limited English proficiency students for each public charter school 
26 is the number of limited English proficiency students from the most recent October 
27 count prior to the year of funding.

29 number of special education students from the most recent October count prior to the 
30 year of funding.

32 school's operating allocation for each year as the sum of: 
33 A. The base allocation, which is the pupil count pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph 
34 A multiplied by the public charter school's EPS per-pupil rates calculated pursuant to 
35 subsection I; 
36 B. The economically disadvantaged student allocation, which is the pupil count

An Act To Amend the Laws Related 1to Public Funding of Charter Schools 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 'A, (H-ag) 
Committee: Education and Cultural Affairs 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill changes the way funding for students who attend authorized public charter schools is provided beginning in 
the 2015-2016 school year. Current law requires the school administrative unit (SAU) in which the student resides to 
forward the per-pupil allocation to the public charter school that the student is attending pursuant to Title 20-A, 
§2413. This legislation proposes to include the cost for authorized public charter schools in the total cost of funding 
public education from kindergarten to grade 12 with the State providing payments for the public charter schools total 
allocation directly to the charter school. This change in methodology shifts the responsibility for funding the local 
share of the cost of sending students to charter schools from the resident school administrative unit to all school 
administrative units. 
The provision in section 6, sub-section 9 of this legislation, which requires a preliminary calculation of the total 
allocation for charter schools based on estimated student COtlJ;lts, increases the total state and local cost of funding 
public education beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 due to those students being included in student counts for both a 
publjc school and a charter school. The Department ofEduc.ation estimates the total state and local cost of this 
provision to be approximately $12.0 million in fiscal year 20115-16 and $13.8 million ,in fiscal year 2016-17. ' 
The Governor's proposed budget for the 2016-2017 biennium includes additional General Fund appropriations of 
$17.9 million in fiscal year 2015-16 and $19.9 million in fiscal year 2016-17 and additional Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocations of $2.4 million and $2.6 million in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively, for the General 
Purpose Aid for Local Schools program. Of these amounts, approximately $14.5 million in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$15.8 million in fiscal year 2016-17 are targeted for specific initiatives, leaving approximately $5.7 million in fiscal 
year 2015-16 and $6.7 million in fiscal year 2016-17 to be distributed as subsidy to local school administrative units. 
According to the Department of Education, these funds will be used to support the State's share of the increased costs 
associated with changing the way funding for authorized public charter schools is determined. 
This fiscal note assumes that funding for this legislation will be approved as part of the Governor's proposed 2016-
2017 biennial budget and, therefore, no General Fund appropriations are included in this bill. This fiscal note may 
need to be adjusted based on final legislative actions of the 127th Legislature, 1st Regular Session. 
All MaineCare school-based costs are reimbursed by Department of Education, based on an agreed upon schedule. 
This bill changes who may be submitting some of the claims, but does not change the basics of this arrangement.
