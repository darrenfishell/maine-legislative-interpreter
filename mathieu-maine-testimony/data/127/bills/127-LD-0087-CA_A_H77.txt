25 This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, strikes the 
26 emergency preamble and emergency clause. It requires the Department of Health and 
27 Human Services to amend the rules on principles of reimbursement for nursing facilities 
28 in the MaineCare Benefits Manual by January 1, 2016. The amendment removes the 
29 provision of the resolve that requires the rules to be amended to restore the crossover 
30 payments to nursing facilities related to nondual qualified Medicare beneficiaries because 
31 the crossover payments are not part of the principles of reimbursement. The amendment 
32 also adds an appropriations and allocations section. The appropriations and allocations 
33 section includes an appropriation and an allocation to restore the crossover payments.
