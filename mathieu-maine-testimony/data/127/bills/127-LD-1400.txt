emissions, as long as the total amount of energy purchased from all long -term contracts 36 
does not exceed 20% of the State's annual retail electricity load.  37 
4.  Priority of long -term contracts.  In selecting energy, capacity or other products 38 
for contracting pursuant to subsection 3, the commission shall prioritize long -term 39 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR1987(01) -1 
 contracts that the com mission determines will maximize financial benefits to electricity 1 
customers.  2 
5.  Contract term.  A contract entered into pursuant to subsection 3 may not be for a 3 
term of more than 10 years, unless the commission finds a contract for a longer term 4 
would p rovide significantly greater ratepayer benefits.  5

and distribution utilities to enter into contracts under this section only a s agents for their 25 
customers and only when such contracts are in the best interest of customers and in 26 
accordance with this subsection. The commission shall adopt rules to ensure that:  27 
A.  To the extent the benefits to ratepayers of a long -term contract ar e projected to 28 
occur in the later years of the contract term, adequate financial security is in place so 29 
that it is reasonably likely ratepayers will obtain the projected benefits of the long - 30 
term contract; and  31 
B.  To the extent practicable, ratepayers obt ain the benefit of any reduction in the cost 32 
of energy, capacity or other products after the term of primary financing or 33 
subsequent replacement financing necessary for the development and construction of 34 
a generation project is completed.  35 
11.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section. In adopting 36

 credits.  Effective January 1, 2016, the bill repeals the renewable portfolio standard, 1 
which requires competitive electrici ty providers to demonstrate to the Public Utilities 2 
Commission that a certain percentage of their portfolio of supply sources for retail 3 
electricity sales comes from renewable resources, new renewable capacity resources and 4 
efficient resources.  The bill r epeals the provision governing net energy billing, which is a 5 
billing and metering practice under which a customer is billed on the basis of net energy 6 
over the billing period taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt -hour credits from 7 
the previous b illing period.  The bill changes the long -term contracting authority of the 8 
Public Utilities Commission and specifies that it is the policy of the State with respect to 9 
long-term contracts to reduce electricity rates and costs for the State's residential a nd 10 
business customers and reduce pollution.  11
