SUMMARY  3 
This bill proposes several changes to Maine law relating to the licensing of insurance 4 
producers, consultants and adjusters.  The bill requires that biennial resident insurance 5 
consultant fees be due at the same time as the biennial continuing education requirement 6 
is due. It adds a provision for insurance adjusters that allows those individuals who live in 7 
a state that does not license adjusters to obtain reciprocal licensing based on their 8 
qualifications in  another state. This bill requires producers to keep both their contact 9 
information up to date, including their e -mail address, in the records of the Department of 10 
Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance.  11
