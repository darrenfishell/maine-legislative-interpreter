The required local activities in this bill may represent a State mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. Unless 
General Fund appropriations are provided to fund at least 90% of the additional costs or a Mandate Preamble is 
amended to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt this mandate from the funding 
requirement, municipalities may not be required to implement these changes. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $73 ,004 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $101,793 in fiscal year 2016-17 
to the Special Services Team program within the Department of Education for the personal services and all other costs 
for one Education Specialist III position to serve as a dyslexia coordinator within the department effective October 1, 
2015. 
Although this bill contains General Fund appropriations to fund the dyslexia coordinator position, the Department of 
Education has indicated that a "change package" to the Governor's proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget will include 
an initiative to create a federally funded Education Specialist III position as part of a proposal to reorganize the 
Special Services Team. According to the department this position, if approved, can be used for the dyslexia 
coordinator and the General Fund position included in this bill will not be needed. Depending on the final actions of 
the Legislature on the'2016-2017 biennial budget, this fiscal note may need to be adjusted.
