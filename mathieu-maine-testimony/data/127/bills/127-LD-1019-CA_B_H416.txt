awarding of diplomas based on student demonstration of proficiency as described in this 24 
section is extended one year for each year for which transition grants are not made 25

school year, the department, if funds are available, shall make annual transition grants to 28

allocating funds, shall make this increase in funding a priority.  For those fiscal years that 41

revenues must be distributed by the department to provide start-up funds for approved 15 
public preschool programs for children 4 years of age in accordance with chapter 203, 16

Council and to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 21

those individuals who qualify for TANF under the United States Social Security 23 
Act, except that they fail to meet the age requirement, and is also operated for the 24
