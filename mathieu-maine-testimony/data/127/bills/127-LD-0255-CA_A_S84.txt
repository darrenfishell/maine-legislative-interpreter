COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" 11 "to S.P. 93, L.D. 255 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill. Unlike the bill, it excludes the designee of a holder 
3 of a municipal shellfish aquaculture permit from potential liability for taking, disturbing 
4 or molesting any shellfish on the permit site. This amendment reduces the maximum 
5 penalty for a person who interferes with the ability of a permittee to carry out the 
6 privileges granted under the permit from $2,000, as provided in the bill, to $1,000 and 
7 provides restitution by that person to the permittee in an amount equal to twice the 
8 replacement value of any damaged equipment on the permit site.
