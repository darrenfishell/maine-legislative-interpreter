Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90 -day period 3 
to provide fo r the filling of any vacancies on the board of trustees of the Hampden Water 4 
District; and  5 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 6 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as  7 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 8 
therefore,  9 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  10 
Sec. 1.  P&SL 1937, c. 34, §8, 4th and 5th ¶¶, as enacted by P&SL 2001, c. 5, 11

The term of office of the trustees begins on the 3r d Thursday of January.  In the event 16 
a vacancy arises in the membership of the board of trustees, the unexpired term of the 17 
vacant office must be filled by the Town Council of the Town of Hampden  trustees may 18 
call and hold a special election to fill the va cancy in the same manner as elections are 19

may, in their discretion, excuse a trustee's failure to attend a meeting or meetings.   All 26 
trustees are eligible for reelection, but a person holding the office of town councilo r or 27 
road commissioner in the Town of Hampden is not eligible for nomination or election as 28 
trustee.  The trustees may procure an office and incur expenses as may be necessary.  29 
Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, section 6410, subsecti on 7, the 30

report of their doings, of the receipts and expenditures of the water district, of its financial 33 
and physical condition and of any other matters and things pertaining to the district that 34 
will show the inhabitants of the district how the trustees are fulfilling the duties and 35 
obligations of their trust, such report to be made and filed with the Town Council of the 36
