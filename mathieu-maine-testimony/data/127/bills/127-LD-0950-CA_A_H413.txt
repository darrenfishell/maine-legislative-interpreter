SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It amends the Maine Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of vaccination status in employment, housing, public 
accommodations, education and credit. 
This amendment provides that, although the vaccination status of an individual is not 
a physical disability, the legal analysis applied to discrimination claims based on the 
vaccination status of an individual or the vaccination status of an individual's minor child 
is the same as that applied to physical disability claims.
