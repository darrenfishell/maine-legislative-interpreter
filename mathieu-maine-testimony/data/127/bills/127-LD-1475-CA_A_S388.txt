21 This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. The bill authorizes a regional school 
22 unit to include an article in the warrant for its annual budget meeting providing that, in 
23 the event that the regional school unit receives more state education subsidy than the 
24 amount included in its budget, the regional school unit board is authorized to increase 
25 expenditures for school purposes in cost center categories approved by the regional 
26 school unit board, without a special budget meeting and budget validation referendum. 
27 The amendment retains that provision and allows a regional school unit to include such 
28 articles for the purposes of increasing the allocation of finances in a reserve fund and 
29 decreasing the local cost share expectation for local property taxpayers for funding public 
30 education.

Fiscal Note 
No State fiscal impact 
Allowing a Regional School Unit (RSU) to include in the warrant for its annual budget meeting an article or articles 
authorizing the RSU Board to take certain actions in the event that additional state subsidy for K-12 public education 
is received above the amount in it's current budget will have no fiscal impact on the State. However, to the extent that 
these additional funds result in increased spending by school units, the calculation of the RSU's future state subsidy 
may be impacted.
