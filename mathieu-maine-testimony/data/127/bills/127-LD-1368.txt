SUMMARY  25 
This bill provides for the notice, reporting and documentation of the u se of restraint 26

incidents involving a client in a one -year period to determine how to reduce the use of 31 
restraint or seclusion with that client.  This bill req uires the chief administrative officer of 32 
each institution under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services 33 
annually to report the aggregate number of incidents of restraint and seclusion for that 34 
institution to the Commissioner of Hea lth and Human Services and for the commissioner 35
