implementation of a universal health care plan that complies with the requirements for 5 
innovation waivers available to states pursuant to the federal Patie nt Protection and 6 
Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111 -148, as amended by the federal Health Care and 7 
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Public Law 111 -152, referred to in this resolve as 8

Sec. 2.  Consultant; proposal.  Resolved:  That the joint standing committee of 10 
the Legislature having jurisdiction over insurance and financial services matters, referred 11 
to in this resolve as "the committee," shall solicit the services of one or more outside 12 
consultants to w ork with the committee to propose to the Legislature at least 3 design 13 
options, including implementation plans, for creating a universal system of health care 14 
that ensures all residents of the State have access to and coverage for affordable, quality 15 
healt h care services that meet the principles and goals outlined in this resolve.  By 16 
October 15, 2016, the consultant or consultants shall release a draft of the design options 17 
to the public, including the data used by the consultant or consultants to develop the 18 
design options, and provide 30 days for public review and the submission of comments 19 
on the design options. The consultant or consultants shall review and consider the public 20

Sec. 3.  Design options.  Resolved:  That the proposal under section 2 must 23 
contain the analysis and recommendations as provided for in this section.  24 
1.  The proposal must include the following design options:  25 
A.  A design for a government -administered and publicly financed unified payer 26 
health benefits system that is decoupled from employment, that prohibits insurance 27 
coverage for the health services provided by the system and that allows for private 28 
insurance  coverage of only supplemental health services;  29 
B.  A design for a universal health benefits system with integrated delivery of health 30 
care and integrated payment systems for all individuals that is centrally administered 31 
by State Government or an entity under contract with State Government; and  32 
C.  A design for a public health benefit option administered by State Government or 33 
an entity under contract with State Government that allows individuals to choose 34 
between the public option and private insurance c overage and allows for fair and 35 
robust competition among public and private plans.  36 
Additional options may be designed by the consultant or consultants, in consultation with 37 
the committee, taking into consideration the parameters described in this section.  38 
Each design option must include sufficient detail to allow the Legislature to consider the 39 
adoption of one design and to determine an implementation plan for that design during 40 
the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature and to initiate implementati on of the 41
