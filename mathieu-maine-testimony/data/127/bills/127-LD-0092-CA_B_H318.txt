This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $16,500 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Bureau of Labor Standards 
within the Department of Labor for the administrative costs associated with increasing the minimum wage. Of this 
amount, $3,500 per year is for updating the minimum wage poster and other related publications, $5,000 per year is 
related to postage costs to distribute the updated poster and publications to all employers in Maine and $8,000 per 
year is for travel costs associated with compliance, education and outreach. 
The first step on the lowest salary rate schedule in State Government is $8.43 per hour. Currently there is no one 
being paid at that level. There are currently 2 employees being paid $9.41 per hour. The 3-step increase in the 
minimum wage in the minority report will not increase salary costs to the State.
