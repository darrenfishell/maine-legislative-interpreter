127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 463, L.D. 682, Bill, "An Act To 
Ensure the Administration of Written Driving Tests" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. 29-A MRSA ยง1304, sub-ยงl-A, ~C, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 493, ยง1, is 
amended to read: 
C. Anyrequired examination for a learner's permit may be administered only by the 
Secretary of State except that the Secretary of State may waive this requirement on 
receipt ofa course completion certificate under section 1351, subsection 3.' 
SUMMARY 
Current law provides that any required examination for a learner's permit may be 
administered only by the Secretary of State, and the bill clarifies the Secretary of State's 
authority regarding these examinations. This amendment, which strikes and replaces the 
bill, provides that the Secretary of State may waive this requirement on receipt of a Maine 
driver education course completion certificate. The amendment also strikes the 
emergency preamble and emergency clause from the bill.
