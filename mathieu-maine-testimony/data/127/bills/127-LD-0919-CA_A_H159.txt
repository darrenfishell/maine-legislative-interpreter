127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 638, L.D. 919, Bill, "An Act To 
Provide Access to Opioid Analgesics with Abuse-deterrent Properties" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in ยง4320-J by striking out all of subsections 2 and 3 (page 
1, lines 16 to 31 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'2. Required coverage. A carrier offering a health plan in this State shall provide 
coverage for abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products listed on any fonnulary, 
preferred drug list or other list of drugs used by the carrier on a basis not less favorable 
than that for opioid analgesic drug products that are not abuse-deterrent and are covered 
by the health plan. An increase in enrollee cost sharing to achieve compliance with this 
section may not be implemented.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment requires all health insurance carriers offering individual and group 
health plans to provide coverage for abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products on a 
basis not less favorable than that for other opioid analgesic drug products, instead of other 
prescription drugs as specified in the bill, on any fonnulary, preferred drug list or other 
list of drugs used by the carrier. 
This amendment removes the prior authorization requirements specified in the bill.

Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium cost increase -All Funds [ H-J59) 
The proposed law would not have any fiscal impact in the current biennium to the state employee health plan because 
non-abuse-deterrent opioids and abuse-deterrent opioids are currently on the same tiers in the formulary for the plan, 
so there is no cost differential. 
To the extent that the State Employee Health Commission (SEHC) might want to adjust formularies in the future to 
guide members toward lower cost generic non-abuse-deterrent opioids, the SEHC would be precluded from doing so 
by this legislation. That could lead to future increased costs due to an inability to utilize that option to achieve 
savings.
