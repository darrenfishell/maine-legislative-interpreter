SUMMARY  15 
Current law allows a municipality to impose service charges on the owner of 16 
residential property that is totally exempt from property taxes, except for student housing 17 
and parsonages, that is used to provide rental income.  18 
This bill instead provides that a municipality may impose service charges on property 19 
that is exempt from taxation because it is o wned or used by entities in the following 20 
categories: benevolent and charitable institutions; literary and scientific institutions; 21 
chambers of commerce and boards of trade; fraternal organizations operating under a 22 
lodge system; and property jointly owned  or used by those entities.  Service charges may 23 
not be imposed on property exempt as a house of worship or parsonage or a veterans' 24 
organization.  25 
Service charges must meet the following conditions:  26 
1.  The property must be owned by an entity that owns exe mpt property in the 27 
municipality that would have a total assessed value of at least $1,000,000 if assessed for 28 
property tax purposes and the property must be owned by, rented to or otherwise 29 
occupied by a person or entity that provides any employee or inde pendent contractor 30 
engaged to provide professional management services with compensation, exclusive of 31 
health benefits, in excess of 4 times the median household income for the county in which 32 
the property is located;  33 
2.  The municipality must adopt an ord inance imposing service charges approved by 34 
the voters through a referendum process;  35 
3.  The municipality may not impose a service charge on individual properties 36 
without imposing service charges on all other property in that municipality that is within 37 
the same category of exempt property;  38 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR0469(01) -1 
 4.  The calculation of service charges imposed by municipalities must be based on the 1 
square footage of building space that is exempt from taxation unless the municipality 2 
determines that a different measure more accurat ely represents the cost of services for 3 
which the service charges are imposed; and  4 
5.  Service charges must be reduced by any payments made or services provided to 5 
the municipality by the exempt entity in lieu of taxes.  6 
The bill provides that municipal ord inances adopted before the effective date of the 7 
legislation remain valid even if they do not comply with the new requirements.  The bill 8 
retains the requirement in current law that service charges may not exceed 2% of the 9 
entity's gross annual revenue.  10
