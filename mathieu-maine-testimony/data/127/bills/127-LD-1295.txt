applicant's eligibility for licensure, th e department is authorized through its rules to 25 
charge an additional fee not to exceed $100 to cover the costs of each additional 26 
inspection or visit. Failure to pay such charges within 30 days of the billing date 27

§275.  Issuance of licenses  30 
The department shall, within 30 days following receipt of an application, issue an 31 
annual license to operate any eating e stablishment that is found to comply with this 32

by municipal inspection made according to section 279, not in compliance with  the 35 
requirements of this chapter or department rules adopted and approved pursuant to 36 
section 276 or section 279, subsection 1, the department may refuse issuance of the initial 37 
license, but shall issue a conditional license, except when conditions are fo und that 38 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1770(01) -1 
 present a serious danger to the health and safety of the public. A conditional license may 1 
not exceed 90 days. Failure by the conditional licensee to meet the conditions specified 2 
by the department permits the department to void the conditional li cense.  3 
The conditional license is void when the department has delivered in hand or by 4 
certified mail a written notice to the conditional licensee or, if the licensee cannot be 5 
reached for service in hand or by certified mail, has left notice thereof at th e facility.  6 
The department may redistribute expiration dates for new and renewed licenses to 7 
provide for comparable distribution of licenses on a quarterly basis throughout the year 8 
and shall prorate the fees for licenses with a term less or more than one year. The 9 
prescribed fee must accompany the application for a new license or the renewal of a 10 
license.  11 
Licenses must be renewed upon application and upon payment of the prescribed fee 12 
and subject to compliance with department rules and with this chapter. T he department 13 
shall provide licensees with notice of the need for renewal and necessary forms no less 14 
than 30 days prior to the expiration of the license.  15 
The issuance of a license under this chapter does not provide exemption from other 16 
state or local law s, ordinances or rules, notwithstanding any other provision of law.  17

department on demand in a notice delivered by hand or by certified mail to the licensee. 19 
For cause, the d epartment may revoke or suspend any license pursuant to section 280.  20 
§276.  Rules and policies  21 
The department is authorized and empowered to make and enforce all necessary rules 22 
for the administration of this chapter and may rescind or modify such rules fr om time to 23 
time as may be in the public interest, insofar as such action is not in conflict with any of 24 
the provisions of this chapter. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical 25 
rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 26 
§277.  Right of entry, inspection and determination of compliance  27 
The department and any duly designated officer or employee of the department have 28 
the right, without an administrative inspection warrant, to enter upon and into the 29 
premises of any eating es tablishment licensed pursuant to this chapter at any reasonable 30

without first obtaining a license as required by this chapter must be punished, upon 16 
adjudication of unlicensed operation, by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than 17 
$200 and, upon a 2nd or sub sequent adjudication of unlicensed operation, must be 18 
punished by a fine of not less than $200 nor more than $500. Each day any such 19 
person, corporation, firm or copartnership operates without obtaining a license 20 
constitutes a separate offense.  21

the Attorney General may seek to enjoin a further violation, in addition to any other 23 
remedy.  24

establishment on the basis of an inspection perf ormed by a health inspector who works 13 
for and is compensated by the municipality in which the eating establishment is located, 14 
but only if the following conditions have been met.  15

shall furnish electronic copies of its inspection reports in a format a nd on a schedule 27 
determined by the department.  28 
5.  Charge.   A municipality may not charge the department for performing 29 
inspections under this section.  30 
6.  License fee.   When a license is issued to an eating establishment located in a 31 
municipality to which  authority to conduct inspection has been delegated by the 32 
department as specified in this section, the requirement for payment of a license fee by 33 
the eating establishment to the department as set forth in section 274 must be waived. 34

support the costs of mailing and handling.  36

complaint with the Dis trict Court in conformity with the Maine Administrative Procedure 13 
Act. A person aggrieved by the refusal of the department to issue a license may request a 14 
hearing in conformity with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  15 
Whenever, upon inspection, condit ions are found that violate this chapter or rules 16 
adopted under this chapter, or that may endanger the life, health or safety of persons 17 
living in or attending any licensed eating establishment under this chapter, the department 18 
may request an emergency su spension of license of the District Court pursuant to Title 4, 19 
section 184, subsection 6, and the court may grant suspension subject to reinstatement 20 
following a hearing before the court if cause is not shown.  21 
§281.  Menu labeling for chain restaurants  22 
The provisions of this section apply to chain restaurants that are located in the State.  23 
1.  Caloric information.   A chain restaurant shall state on a food display tag, menu 24 
or menu board the total amount of calories per serving of each food and beverage item  25 
listed for sale on the food display tag, menu or menu board. The statement of calories 26 
required in this subsection must be:  27 
A.  Clear and conspicuous;  28 
B.  Adjacent to or in close proximity and clearly associated with the item to which the 29 
statement refers ; and  30 
C.  Printed in a font and format at least as prominent in size and appearance as the 31 
name or the price of the item to which the statement refers.  32 
As the statement of calories pertains to beer, wine and spirits, the statement must also 33 
meet the requir ements of subsection 6.  34 
2.  Determining caloric content.   The caloric content information required by 35 
subsection 1 must be determined on a reasonable basis and may be determined only once 36 
per standard menu item if the chain restaurant follows a standardize d recipe, trains to a 37 
consistent method of preparation and maintains a reasonably consistent portion size.  For 38 
the purposes of this subsection, a reasonable basis for determining caloric content means 39 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR1770(01) -1 
 use of a recognized method for determining caloric con tent, including, but not limited to, 1 
nutrient databases, laboratory testing and other reliable methods of analysis. Caloric 2 
content may be rounded to the nearest 10 calories for caloric content above 50 calories 3 
and to the nearest 5 calories for caloric co ntent of 50 calories and below.  4 
3.  Required statement.   A menu or menu board or written nutrition information 5 
provided to a customer by a chain restaurant must contain the following statement in a 6 
clear and conspicuous manner and in a prominent location: "To maintain a healthy 7 
weight, a typical adult should consume approximately 2,000 calories per day; however, 8 
individual calorie needs may vary." A menu, menu board or written nutrition information 9 
provided to a customer by a chain restaurant may include th e following statement or a 10 
statement similar to the following: "Nutrition information is based upon standard recipes 11 
and product formulations; however, modest variations may occur due to differences in 12 
preparation, serving sizes, ingredients or special ord ers." 13 
4.  Different varieties.   For a food or beverage item that is listed as a single item but 14 
includes more than one variety, the caloric information required under subsection 1 for 15 
that item must be the median value of calories for all varieties offered  for that item if the 16 
caloric information for each variety of the item is within 20% of the median for that item. 17 
If the caloric information required by subsection 1 for a variety of a food or beverage 18 
item is not within 20% of the median for that item, th e caloric information must be stated 19 
for each variety of that item. If a food display tag is used to identify a specific variety of a 20 
food or beverage item, the caloric information required by subsection 1 must be for that 21 
specific variety of the item.  22 
5.  Exceptions.   A chain restaurant is not required to provide information pursuant to 23 
subsection 1 for:  24 
A.  Food items served at a self -service salad bar or buffet;  25 
B.  An item offered for a limited time that appears on a menu, menu board or food 26 
display tag  for less than 90 days per year;  27 
C.  A condiment or other item offered to a customer for general use without charge;  28

board or food display tag.  32

or menu board the average caloric value for beer, wine an d spirits as established by the 34 
United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service in the National 35 
Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. A food display tag, menu or menu board for 36 
beer, wine and spirits may include the following stat ement: "Signature drinks or liqueurs 37 
with added ingredients may contain increased caloric content."  38 
7.  Compliance; enforcement.   The department or an agent authorized to inspect an 39 
eating establishment under section 279 shall ensure compliance with the pr ovisions of 40 
this section but is not required to verify the accuracy of the caloric information required 41 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR1 770(01) -1 
 by this section. Upon request a chain restaurant shall provide to the department 1 
documentation of the accuracy of the information required by subsection  1. A violation of 2 
this section is a violation of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, enforceable against the 3 
owner or franchisee of the chain restaurant, except that no private remedies exist under 4 
Title 5, section 213. This section may not be construed  to create or enhance any claim, 5 
right of action or civil liability that did not exist under state law prior to the effective date 6 
of this subsection or limit any claim, right of action or civil liability that otherwise exists 7 
under state law. No private r ight of action arises out of this section. The only mechanism 8 
for enforcing this section is as provided in this subsection.  9 
8.  Uniformity of regulation; preemption.   To the extent consistent with federal 10 
law, the regulation of disclosure of caloric and nu trition information is a matter of 11 
statewide concern, and state law governing that disclosure occupies the whole field of 12 
regulation regarding disclosure by chain restaurants of nutrition information and 13 
requirements regarding the content required to be po sted on menus, menu boards and 14 
food display tags. A local government may not adopt an ordinance regulating the 15 
dissemination of caloric or nutrition information or requiring information to be placed on 16 
menus, menu boards or food display tags by a chain res taurant, and any ordinance or 17 
regulation that violates this subsection is void and has no force or effect.  18 
§282.  Exceptions  19 
A license is not required for temporary eating establishments or for railroad dining or 20 
buffet cars.  21 
Stores or other establishments  where bottled soft drinks or ice cream is sold for 22 
consumption from the original containers only and where no tables, chairs, glasses or 23 
other utensils are provided in connection with such sale are not considered eating 24 
establishments. At such establishme nts, straws or spoons may be provided to aid in the 25 
consumption of such bottled soft drinks or ice cream, as long as they are supplied in 26 
original individual single service sterile packages.  27 
Nonprofit organizations including, but not limited to, 4 -H Clubs,  councils and local 28 
units of incorporated nonprofit national scouting organizations and agricultural societies 29

beverages at not more than 12 public events or meals within one ca lendar year.  31 
§283.  Transaction fee for electronic renewal of license  32

electronically under this chapter. The fee may not exceed the cost of providing the 34 
electronic license r enewal service. The department may adopt rules necessary to 35 
implement this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are routine technical rules 36 
as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 37
