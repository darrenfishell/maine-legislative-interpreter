11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
12 inserting the following: 
13 'Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
14 Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §10109, sub-§3-A is enacted to read: 
15 3-A. Payments. The trust shall transfer to the commission $3,000,000 per year 
16 during fiscal years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 to be used by the commission for 
1 7 disbursements to affected customers. Affected customers who use the disbursement 
18 toward an efficiency measure approved by the trust in the fiscal year in which it is 
19 received must receive $1 of assistance from the trust for every $3 that is applied by the 
20 affected customer toward the cost of the approved efficiency measure as long as the total 
21 of assistance from the trust and the disbursement allocated by the commission under this 
22 subsection for that customer for that fiscal year does not exceed 65% of the total measure 
23 cost. 
24 For the purposes of this subsection, "affected customer" means a customer who is not 
25 primarily in the business of selling electricity, is receiving service at a transmission or 
26 subtransmission voltage level as defined in section 10110, subsection 6 within the 
27 electrical utility transmission system administered by an independent system operator of 
28 the New England bulk power system or a successor organization and is an energy-
29 intensive manufacturer, as defined in reports prepared by the U.S. Energy Information 
30 Administration. The commission may also determine that a manufacturer not defined as 
31 an energy-intensive manufacturer in reports prepared by the U.S. Energy Information 
32 Administration is an affected customer if that manufacturer meets the other requirements 
33 of the definition under this subsection. 
34 A. No later than November 1st of each applicable fiscal year, the commission shall 
35 direct funds totaling $3,000,000 per year during fiscal years 2016-17, 2017-18 and

B. Expenditures from the trust fund relating to conservation of electricity and 
mitigation or reduction of greenhouse gases must be made predominantly on the basis 
of a competitive bid process for long-term contracts, subject to rules adopted by the 
board under section 10105. Rules adopted by the board to implement the competitive 
bid process under this paragraph may not include an avoided cost methodology for 
compensating successful bidders. Bidders may propose contracts designed to 
produce greenhouse gas savings or electricity conservation savings, or both, on a unit 
cost basis. Contracts must be commercially reasonable and may require liquidated 
damages to ensure performance. Contracts must provide sufficient certainty of 
payment to enable commercial financing of the conservation measure purchased and 
its installation. 
C. The board may target bid competitions in areas or to participants as they consider 
necessary, as long as the requirements of paragraph A are satisfied.·

fully implement the triennial plan. 
F. No more than $800,000 of trust fund receipts in any one year may be used for the 
costs of administering the trust fund pursuant to this section. The limit on

monitoring of allowance trading activity and managing and evaluating the trust's 
funding of conservation programs. 
G. In order to minimize administrative costs and maximize program participation 
and effectiveness, the trustees shall, to the greatest extent feasible, coordinate the 
delivery of and make complementary the energy efficiency programs under this 
section and other programs under this chapter. 
H. The trust shall consider delivery of efficiency programs by means of contracts 
with service providers that participate in competitive bid processes for reducing 
energy consumption within individual market segments or for particular end uses. 
I. A trade association aggregator is eligible to participate in competitive bid 
processes under this subsection.

33 This amendment is the majority report and it strikes and replaces the bill. This 
amendment provides that $3,000,000 of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust 
Fund revenue is to be returned to certain affected customers in the form of an annual 
disbursement during fiscal years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The amendment 
requires that the Public Utilities Commission determine the allocation of disbursements 
based on an affected customer's proportion of the customer's retail purchase of electricity 
as measured in kilowatt-hours for the prior calendar year. This amendment defines 
"affected customer." Affected customers that elect to use the disbursement toward an 
efficiency measure approved by the Efficiency Maine Trust would receive $1 of 
assistance from the trust for every $3 that is applied toward the measure by the affected 
customer as long as the total of assistance from the trust and the disbursement allocated 
by the commission does not exceed 65% of the total cost of the measure. This 
amendment also specifies that, other than the $1 for every $3 invested assistance, during 
the fiscal years in which the disbursements are allotted an affected customer is not 
eligible to receive financial or other assistance from the trust fund, except in relation to 
program opportunities noticed prior to July 1, 2016. This amendment requires that the 
commission include in the commission's annual report a description of its activities in 
relation to the disbursement process, a list of affected customers receiving disbursements 
and those affected customers who elect to use the disbursement toward efficiency 
measures and the results of the program. 
34 This amendment requires that any revenue remaining after providing disbursements 
35 and accounting for other costs authorized be allocated in a proportional share to 
36 residential programs and commercial and industrial programs. This amendment adds that 
37 the remaining money be allocated to measures that also increase energy efficiency and 
38 that measures to reduce the cost of residential heating are available to low-income 
39 households. It also allows the trust to consider measures at commercial and industrial 
40 facilities that lower peak capacity demand when promoting electricity savings.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill transfers $3,000,000 in each of fiscal years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 from the Regional Greenhouse 
Gas Initiative Trust Fund (RGGI Fund) within Efficiency Maine Trust to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to be 
used for disbursements to certain customers. The RGGI Fund has sufficient resources to make these transfers. This 
bill also directs the RGGI Fund to expend 50% of its funds for residential programs and 50% for commercial and 
industrial programs. There is no estimate at this time on the amount of funds to be expended from the RGGI Fund. 
The bill also requires the PUC to conduct an expedited proceeding to determine the inital allocation of disbursements 
to certain customers. The PUC has sufficient budgeted resources to conduct a proceeding and make disbursements to 
customers.
