'§3477. Municipal solar procurement 
1. Procurement. The commission shall conduct a competitive solicitation as 
frequently as the commission determines reasonable but no less than once per year for 
long-term contracts for the output of solar distributed generation resources of up to 5 
megawatts associated with a single municipal customer account. In each calendar year, 
the commission shall seek to procure approximately 20% of the capacity needed to meet 
the procurement target in section 3475, subsection 1; except that the commission may 
modify this annual allocation if it concludes that doing so would be in the best interests of 
all ratepayers. Prior to a solicitation, the commission shall develop, in consultation with 
the standard buyer, a standard contract that commits all parties to commercially 
reasonable behavior and includes provisions to ensure that projects proceed to 
commercial operation on a reasonable timeline. 
2. Bidder eligibility. The commission may establish minimum requirements for 
bidders in a solicitation under subsection 1, including but not limited to site control, 
completion of an interconnection application and system details for potential bidders. The 
commission may require bidders to pay an application fee to defray administrative costs. 
3. Ensuring competition. Prior to each solicitation under subsection 1, the 
commission shall establish standards to ensure that the solicitation has a sufficient 
number of unique bidders and quantity of offered capacity to be determined competitive. 
If the commission concludes based on these standards that a solicitation is not 
competitive, no bidders may be selected and the capacity available in that solicitation 
must be deferred to a subsequent solicitation. The commission may adjust the maximum 
project size eligible for a solicitation to ensure that there is more than one bid selected. 
4. Bid selection. Following review of bids, if the commission determines that the 
solicitation under subsection 1 is competitive, the commission shall select one or more 
winning bidders and direct the standard buyer to negotiate and enter into a contract with 
the winning bidder or bidders for a term of 15 years at a specified contract rate. When 
selecting bids, the commission shall consider the geographic distribution of solar 
distributed generation resources in the State, grid reliability and overall economic

to be built on farmland designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland of statewide 
importance" by the United States Department of Agriculture is designed and built in a 
manner that does not remove topsoil or otherwise permanently impair the suitability of 
that land for future agricultural use. The report must also include an evaluation of what 
actions can be taken to ensure that the decommissioning of solar distributed generation 
resources procured pursuant to Title 35-A, sections 3477 to 3479 on farmland that is 
designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland of statewide importance" occurs in a 
manner that enables the farmland to be returned to agricultural use. The report may 
include recommendations for legislation that may be necessary to address these issues. 
The joint standing committees may each report out a bill to the First Regular Session of 
the 128th Legislature based on the report. The Public Utilities Commission may not 
contract for a new solar distributed generation resource pursuant to Title 35-A, sections 
3477 to 3479 if it is to be sited on farmland designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland 
of statewide importance" by the United States Department of Agriculture until 90 days 
after the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature. 
Sec. 9. Reports. By February 1, 2019 and again by February 1, 2021, the Public 
Utilities Commission shall submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
having jurisdiction over utilities and energy matters a report on the status of solar 
distributed generation resource procurement. Each report must include the level of 
procurement for each solar distributed generation resource segment and how that 
compares to the procurement targets for those segments established in the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3475. If the commission determines that procurement targets 
are unlikely to be met, the report must include recommendations to achieve procurement 
targets. The report may also include other recommendations as they relate to Title 35-A, 
chapter 34-B. The joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
utilities and energy matters may report out a bill relating to solar distributed generation 
resource procurement to the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature and may also 
report out a bill relating to solar distributed generation resource procurement to the First
