COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to H.P. 682, L.D. 987

2 apply to a notice of suspension issued pursuant to this subsection.'

6 This amendment removes from the bill the language that provides that if the motor 
7 vehicle involved in a toll violation is registered in another jurisdiction and the registered 
8 owner's address is not known by the Maine Turnpike Authority, the notice may be sent to 
9 the motor vehicle registry of the jurisdiction that issued the registration. Instead, the 
10 amendment provides that the notice may be sent to an address for the registered owner 
11 obtained by the Maine Turnpike Authority through other reasonable means, including but 
12 not limited to through databases compiled by law enforcement or other government 
13 agencIes. 
14 The amendment also removes from the bill section 3 and the cross-reference in 
15 section 4 to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 2482, which relates to notice 
16 of suspension or revocation of a license, and replaces it with language that provides that 
17 the suspension takes effect on the date specified in the notice, which may not be less than 
18 10 days after the mailing of the notification.
