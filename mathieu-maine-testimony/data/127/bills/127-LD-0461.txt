 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §13201, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2011, c. 420, Pt. F, §1 2 
and affected by §2, is further amended to read:  3 
After a probationary period of 3 years, subsequent contracts of duly ce rtified teachers 4 
must be for not less than 2 years.  Unless a duly certified teacher receives written notice 5 
to the contrary at least 6 months  before the terminal date of the contract, the contract must 6 
be extended automatically for one year and similarly in subsequent years.  The 7 
superintendent shall notify the teacher in writing of the superintendent's decision not to 8 
renew the teacher's contract at least 90 days before the terminal date of the contract. If, 9 
after receiving a complaint from a teacher, the  commissioner finds that notice of 10 
nonrenewal was given less than 90 days before the terminal date of the contract, the 11 
school administrative unit shall pay a forfeiture to the teacher equal to the teacher's per 12 
diem salary rate times the number of days be tween the terminal date of the contract and 13 
90 days after the date written notice is given.   The right to an extension for a longer 14 
period of time through a new contract is specifically reserved to the contracting parties.  15
