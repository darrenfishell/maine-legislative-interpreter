 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, effective July 8, 2015, Maine law will require that a commercial learner's 3 
permit holder m ust be 18 years of age or older, a change made to conform to a federal 4 
regulation change; and  5 
Whereas, recently enacted federal legislation, the Consolidated and Further 6 
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law No. 113 -235, provides that specified 7 
federal funds may not be used to enforce that change in regulation in a state that, like 8 
Maine, allowed issuance of a commercial learner's permit to the state's residents under 18 9 
years of age prior to May 9, 2011; and  10 
Whereas, many of the State's vocationa l and technical schools provide commercial 11 
driver education instruction and programs to residents under 18 years of age, which 12 
allows them to obtain their commercial license upon reaching 18 years of age and which 13 
allows them to gain employment in the truc king industry upon reaching the age of 14 
majority; and  15 
Whereas, the State's economy benefits by having a pool of licensed commercial 16 
drivers to meet the needs of the trucking industry; and  17 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an em ergency within 18 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 19 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 20 
therefore,  21 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows : 22 
Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §1304, sub -§4-A, ¶D, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 381, Pt. B, 23 
§16, is repealed.  24 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 25 
legislation takes effect when approved.  26 
SUMMARY  27 
This bill repeals the requirement that  limits eligibility for a commercial learner's 28 
permit to an applicant 18 years of age or older in a section of law that takes effect July 8, 29 
2015.  30
