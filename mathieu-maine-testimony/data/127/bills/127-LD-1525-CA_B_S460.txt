Printer Service Contracts over $5,000' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the

'Sec. 1. 5 MRSA ยง1825-B, sub-ยง15 is enacted to read: 
15. Economic impact considerations. The following service contracts established 
under this subchapter and advertised for competitive bid must include scoring criteria to 
evaluate a bidder's economic impact on the State's economy and revenues: 
A. Service contracts expected to exceed $100,000 in total value; and 
B. Printing service contracts expected to exceed $5,000 in total value.'

This amendment is the minority report of the committee. It requires the use of scoring 
criteria on service contracts expected to exceed $100,000 and printing service contracts 
expected to exceed $5,000 to evaluate a bidder's economic impact on Maine's economy 
and state revenues.
