SUMMARY  7 
This bill provides Maine consumers with an opportunity to avoid home mortgage 8 
foreclosure by participating in mediation at an early stage of default before foreclosure 9 
has commenced.  A mortgagee may request a  mortgagor to participate in preforeclosure 10 
mediation if the property subject to the mortgage is owner -occupied residential property 11 
of 4 or fewer units, and the mortgage payment is at least 35 days late.  A mortgagor who 12 
participates or who fails or refus es to participate in the preforeclosure mediation program 13 
is not entitled to participate in the existing foreclosure mediation program.  Current law 14 
provides for foreclosure mediation only after a foreclosure has been filed in court.  15
