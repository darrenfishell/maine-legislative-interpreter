Fiscal Note for Original Bill
This legislation provides that, beginning in fiscal year 2016-17, the department shall consider providing state grants 
from the Fund for the Efficient Delivery of Educational Services to support qualified school leadership academies.  
Public Law 2015, Chapter 267, Part T, the 2016-2017 biennial budget enacted on June 30, 2015, transferred $750,000 
in each year of the biennium from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the Fund for the Efficient 
Delivery of Educational Services which, at the time had a zero balance.  That provision was repealed, however, as part 
of Public Law 2015, Chapter 388, An Act To Provide for Tax Conformity and Funding Methods, enacted on March 
16, 2016, bringing the balance in the Fund back to zero.  Unless funding is provided in this or future legislation, no 
monies will be available in the Fund to provide the grants.
This legislation also allows for the Commissioner of Education to expend and disburse funds to support the 
establishment of regional school leadership academies from the enhancing school performance and opportunity cost 
component within the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools account.  There currently are no funds budgeted for this 
purpose in either year of the 2016-2017 biennium.This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $148,075 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the General Purpose Aid for 
Local Schools program within the Department of Education for one Education Specialist III position and one Office 
Associate II position and related All Other costs associated with providing services and resources to school 
administrative units that form regional school leadership academies.  The General Fund cost to support the 2 positions 
in the 2018-2019 biennium is estimated to be $153,666 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $159,481 in fiscal year 2018-19.Committee: Education and Cultural Affairs
