SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, adds high school 
seniors to the definition of "STEM student" under the Maine Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics Loan Program and requires that the institution of higher 
education be in this State. The amendment changes the maximum loan term from 4 years 
to 5 years and strikes a reference to loans bearing an annual interest rate of 8% being 
available to students who, upon graduation, are not employed in the field of science, 
computer science, technology, engineering or mathematics. This amendment allows a 
person who is working as an educator in the field of science, computer science, 
technology, engineering or mathematics to qualify for a 0% interest rate. This 
amendment removes the authority for the Commissioner of Education to grant funds to 
the Maine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Loan Fund. This 
amendment adds a requirement that the Finance Authority of Maine submit a report 
regarding the effectiveness of the program to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over education and cultural affairs by January 15th of the 
5th year after the loan program begins awarding loans.
