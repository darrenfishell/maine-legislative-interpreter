Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -School Administrative Units 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Adding unapproved major capital projects to the definition of debt service costs for school subsidy purposes will 
increase the total cost of funding public education from kindergarten to grade 12 beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 by 
increasing the total debt service allocation, a component of the essential programs and services model. The cost of 
this requirement in fiscal year 2016-17 is not available. Since no additional state funds are being provided in this 
amendment, the total cost of this provision will be shared entirely by local school administrative units. 
Part C of Public Law 2015, c. 389, which was signed into law on March 10, 2016 as an emergency measure, sets the 
mill expectation and establishes the state and local contributions for funding the total cost of funding K-12 public 
education for fiscal year 2016-17. This amendment does not address how the Department of Education will amend PL 
2015, c. 389, Part C to incorporate the changes to the debt service allocation, the local contribution amount and the 
mill expectation if this amendment is incorporated into the bill and enacted into law.
