further amended to read:  3 
C.  For the privilege of operating a motor vehicle or camper trailer on the public 4 
ways, each m otor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or each camper trailer to be so 5 
operated is subject to excise tax as follows, except as specified in subparagraph (3), 6 
(4) or, (5) or (6) :  a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for 7 
the first or current year of model, 17 1/2 mills for the 2nd year, 13 1/2 mills for the 8 
3rd year, 10 mills for the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 5th year and 4 mills for the 6th 9 
and succeeding years.  The minimum tax is $5 for a motor vehicle other than a 10 
bicycle with motor attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with motor attached, $15 for a 11 
camper trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent trailer.  The excise tax on a 12 
stock race car is $5.  13 
(1)  On new registrations of automobiles, trucks and truck tractors, the excise tax 14 
payment must be made prior to registration and is for a one -year period from the 15 
date of registration.  16 
(2)  Vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan are subject to an 17 
excise tax determined on a monthly proration basis if  their registration period is 18 
less than 12 months.  19 
(3)  For commercial vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after, the 20 
amount of excise tax due for trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 21 
26,000 pounds and for Class A special mobile equip ment, as defined in Title 22 
29-A, section 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original 23 
year of title rather than on the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the 24 
application of excise tax is determined by the initial bill of s ale or the state sales 25 
tax document provided at point of purchase.  The initial bill of sale is that issued 26 
by the dealer to the initial purchaser of a new vehicle.  27 
(4)  For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise 28 
tax due is b ased on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on 29 
the list price.  Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is 30 
determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided at 31 
point of purchas e.  The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 32 
purchaser of a new vehicle.  33 
(5)  For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have 34 
been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, fro nt axle 35 
or body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new 36 
certificate of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based 37 
on the maker's list price of the prepackaged kit.  38 
(6)  A motor vehicle in its first or cur rent year of model that has been previously 39 
registered by a different owner or that is not covered by a manufacturer's new car 40 
warranty is considered a used vehicle, and the excise tax must be determined as if 41 
the motor vehicle was in its 2nd year of model . 42 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0732(01) -1 
 For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29 -A, section 405, subsection 1, 1 
paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 2 
registration.  3 
SUMMARY  4 
Current law requires the excise tax on a motor vehicle to be based o n the maker's list 5 
price and model year.  If a vehicle is registered by a different owner during the first 6 
model year, the excise tax is still based on the first model year.  7 
This bill specifies that a motor vehicle being registered for a 2nd time during th e first 8 
model year of that motor vehicle or a motor vehicle that is still in its first model year but 9 
is not covered by a manufacturer's new car warranty is considered a used vehicle and 10 
requires the excise tax to be based on the 2nd model year.  11
