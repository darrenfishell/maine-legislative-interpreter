24 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 300, L.D. 856 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes and replaces the bill. Like the bill, the amendment expands 
the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program to include participants who are under 18 
years of age if they are full-time students at a public secondary school and enrolled in a 
career and technical education program at a career and technical education center or a 
career and technical education region. The amendment requires these participants to meet 
the other eligibility criteria of the program, which require that participants: 
1. Not have a marketable postsecondary degree; 
2. Have family income less than 200% of the federal poverty level; 
3. Be applying for education or training for a job in an approved industry; and 
4. Have the aptitude to undertake and complete education or training as determined 
by the institution providing the education or training. 
The amendment caps program expenditures for these students, including 
administrative and case management costs and the costs for these students if they 
continue in the program after reaching 18 years of age, at 15% of the annual revenue of 
the Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund. 
The amendment provides that these provisions are repealed January 1, 2020. The 
Department of Labor must submit a report to the Legislature regarding these changes to 
the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program, and the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over workforce training matters is authorized to report out 
a bill to the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature. 
This amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section to the bill.

management related to this provision at no more than 15% of the annual revenue deposited into the Competitive Skills 
Scholarship Fund. Had this legislation been in place during fiscal year 2013-14 the cap on expenditures would have 
been approximately $500,000.
