19 SUMMARY 
20 This amendment establishes a competitive bid process for a casino in either 
21 Washington County or Aroostook County, the operation of which is to maximize 
22 economic and employment benefits for the 4 federally recognized Indian tribes in the 
23 State, !mown as the northern casino. The Casino Development Commission is directed to 
24 develop a request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the 
25 Department of Public Safety, Gambling Control Board for a casino operator license. Prior 
26 to the commission's submitting a request for proposals for a northern casino operator 
27 license, voters would have to approve the operation of a casino by a countywide 
28 referendum. The referendum must be held on the same date as a statewide election and no 
29 sooner than June 1, 2017 and no later than July 1, 2018. The fee to submit a bid to the 
30 commission is $100,000 for a northern casino. It provides for specific supporting 
31 information to be submitted by the bidder and considered by the commission including 
32 the bidder's ability to make a minimum capital investment of $20,000,000 for a northern 
33 casino. The bid for a noi;them casino requires a partnership with at _least 2 federally 
34 recognized Indian tribes in the State. 
35 For the northern casino, the commission is directed to develop a point system for the 
36 factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and give priority to proposals that 
3 7 maximize the employment and economic benefits to federally recognized Indian tribes in 
38 the State. The winning bidder must enter into a contract with the commission that 
39 obligates the casino operator to abide by the proposals made in the winning bid. Failure to 
40 abide by the terms of the contract could result in financial penalties to the operator. 
41 The license fee for a northern casino under the amendment is $1,000,000 for a 5-year 
42 term with a renewal fee of $100,000.

15 SENATE AMENDMENT" B" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "E" to H.P. 876, L.D. 1280 
The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine revenue for the northern 
casino at 46% and sets the distribution of net table game revenue for the casino at 16%. 
The bill authorizes the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs to submit 
legislation establishing a distribution of the slot machine and table game revenue required 
to be paid by the casino. 
Under current law, 4% of net slot machine income must be forwarded to the tribal 
governments of the Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe, unless those tribal 
governments own or receive funds from a slot machine facility or casino, other than the 
casino located in Oxford County or the slot machine facility in Bangor, in which case the 
tribal governments are not due any of the net slot machine income. This amendment 
removes that disqualification, allowing those tribal governments to receive net slot 
machine income even if they own or receive· funds from a slot machine facility or casino.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
If Washington and Aroostook counties choose to hold referendums during the state primary election in June 2016, the 
Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $11, 772 for ballot printing costs and 
postage. If the counties elect to hold referendums during the general election in November 2016, the Department of 
Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $14,464 for ballot printing. costs and postage only if the . 
questions require printing a separate ballot. 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for a casino to a single 
applicant. Bidders will pay a $100,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. Any bidding fees will be 
credited to the General Fund. The Gambling Control Board will accept an application for a casino license in either 
Aroostook County or Washington County from the winning bidder as long as the voters of the county where the 
proposed casino will be.located have voted to approve a casino. Only one casino, in either Aroostook or Washington 
County, may be licensed. The Department of the Attorney General will also require a General Fund appropriation of 
$63 ,3 54 in fiscal year 2016-17 for one part-time Assistant Attorney General position dedicated to the Casino 
Development Commission. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 46% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill requires a 
casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital improvements to the casino 
using 2% to 3% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct those funds to the Gambling Control 
Board. This fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the Gambling Control Board. The bill 
limits the number of slot machines to 250 for the first 3 years of the casino's operation, then allows 350 slot machines 
after that. 250 slot machines and 10 table games for the first 3 years of the casino's operation would generate estimated 
annual revenue of $7,1~6,711 credited to the Gambling Control Board. 350 slot machines and 10 table games starting 
in the fourth year of the casino's operation would generate estimated annual revenue of $9 ,804,000 for the Gambling 
Control Board. This revenue will be retained within the board until the Legislature decides on a distribution.

SB(s-~Y2) 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $100,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license will 
bring in General Fund revenue of $1,000,000 in the first year and registration fees of $iOO per slot machine and per 
table game will generate Other Special Revenue Ftmds revenue of $36,000 annually. A one-time renewal fee due five 
years after the casino begins operating will generate Other Special Revenue Funds revenue of $100,000. Annual State 
costs associated with 5 inspectors, an auditor and other related expenses are estimated to be $523,510. The Department 
of Public Safety will require Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $523 ,510 to cover the annual state costs. 
Under current law, 4% of net slot machine income from Oxford Casino is directed to the Penobscot Nation and the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe unless they receive funds from a slot machine facility or casino other than Oxford Casino or 
Hollywood Casino, in which case Oxford Casino would retain the 4% of net slot machine income. This amendment 
allows the Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe to receive the 4% regardless of whether they receive 
revenue from casinos other than Oxford or Hollywood. This results in an estimated annual revenue increase of 
$2,527,134 to the tribes. 
This legislation is expected to have only a minor impact on revenues generated by the Hollywood and Oxford casinos.
