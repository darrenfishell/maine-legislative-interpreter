FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 323, L.D. 484, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding the Confidentiality of Railroad Carrier Cargo" 
Amend the bill in section 3 by striking out all of paragraph V (page 1, lines 14 to 16 
in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'V. Records provided by a railroad company describing hazardous materials 
transported by the railroad company in this State, the routes of hazardous materials 
shipments and the frequency of hazardous materials operations on those routes that 
are in the possession of a state or local emergency management entity or law 
enforcement agency, a fire department or other first responder. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, "hazardous material" has the same meaning as set forth in 49 Code of 
Federal Regulations, Section 105.5.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that the exception to the definition of "public record" 
proposed in the bill is limited to records provided by a railroad company that describe 
hazardous materials that are transported by the railroad company, the routes of the 
hazardous materials shipments and the frequency of the hazardous materials operations 
on those routes when those records are in the possession of state or local emergency 
management entities or law enforcement agencies, fire departments or other first 
responders. The amendment also provides that "hazardous material" has the same 
definition as in 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 105.5.
