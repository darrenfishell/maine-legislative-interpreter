(8) Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise settlement

(9) The identity of a complainant or a 3rd-party witness who has established a 
compelling and immediate need to proceed with or participate in an investigation

B. Information designated as confidential in paragraph A may not be released 
without the written authorization of the person who is the subject of the information, 
except that during an investigation conducted pursuant to subsection 1, if the case 
relates to the complainant's medical diagnosis or disability, the respondent is entitled 
to receive unredacted copies of the complainant's medical records, medical diagnoses, 
medical information and information regarding any disability experienced by the

C. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to limit the ability of the commission 
during the pendency of an investigation or during its deliberations in a complaint at a 
public hearing to consider or discuss information designated confidential under this 
subsection, if that information is relevant to consideration of and deliberation in the 
complaint. 
D. At the close of the investigation, the signed report of the investigator is a public 
record. Drafts of the report of the investigator are not public records except that if the

process, the [mal draft containing the earlier recommendation is a public record. 
E. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to limit the ability of a person to 
provide written authorization to disclose information about that person that is 
designated confidential by this section.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. It replaces section 2 of the 
bill but, like the bill, it revises the confidentiality provisions of the Maine Human Rights 
Act. This amendment protects from public disclosure information in the records of the 
Maine Human Rights Commission that identifies a minor, a person's medical condition or 
disability, the identity of a person not a party to a complaint at the commission, personnel 
records, social security numbers, residential addresses and personal phone numbers,
