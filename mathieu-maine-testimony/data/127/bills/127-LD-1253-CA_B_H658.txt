Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The legislation requires the Department of Education to develop and implement a school accountability system to 
measure school performance and student proficiency beginning with the 2018-2019 school year and to provide an 
annual report of the statewide and school-level results ofthe performance of schools and proficiency of students in 
each of the State's elementary and secondary schools that meet the reporting requirements of the federal Every Studer, 
Succeeds Act of 2015, 20 United States Code, Chapter 70 and related regulations. According to the Department, 
accountability reporting requirements for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) have not yet been established so the 
department does not know if the requirements in this legislation exceed what will be required on the federal level. 
Any requirements that go beyond what is required under ESSA can not be funded with federal dollars and will require 
General Fund support in order to be completed.
