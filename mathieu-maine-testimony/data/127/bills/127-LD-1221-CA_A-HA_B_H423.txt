funds are adequate to meet the funding needs of the office. The committee amendment had limited these transfers to a 
total of $300,000 over time. The amendment adds Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the MEO of $232, 138 
and $207,660 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively, to fund certain activities related to energy resources, 
planning and development. The amendment also adds Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of$67,862 and 
$92,340 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively, to establish a deputy commissioner position within the 
MEO. The amendment removes the emergency preamble and clause from the bill and this fiscal note assumes that the 
bill will become law on October 1, 2015.
