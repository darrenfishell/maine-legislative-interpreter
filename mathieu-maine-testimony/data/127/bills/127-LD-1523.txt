 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, under the current salary schedules, persons who supervise law 3 
enforcement officers are not  adequately paid for the additional responsibilities and duties 4 
arising from their supervisory positions; and  5 
Whereas, this deficiency in compensation has the effect of discouraging law 6 
enforcement officers from seeking supervisory positions and makes it h arder for law 7 
enforcement agencies to recruit qualified candidates to fill those positions; and  8 
Whereas, it is important that this deficiency in compensation be corrected as soon 9 
as possible to ensure that law enforcement supervisors are of the best qualit y; and  10 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 11 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 12 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 13 
therefore, be it  14 
Sec. 1.  Salary schedule for law enforcement supervisors changed. 15 
Resolved:   That the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 16 
Human Resources shall amend by August 1, 2016 its rules regarding compensation to 17 
ensure that the fixed salary schedule for positions classified as law enforcement 18 
supervisors is increased by 5%; and be it further  19
