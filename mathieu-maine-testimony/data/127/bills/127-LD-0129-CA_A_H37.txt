127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,: A "to H.P. 87, L.D. 129, Bill, "An Act To Provide 
Options to Schools for Making Up School Days" 
Amend the bill after the title and before the enacting clause by inserting the 
following. 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, last winter's weather conditions included blizzards and snowstonns that 
set records for the amount of snowfall in many regions of the State, which caused the 
cancellation of a significant number of school days in many school administrative units 
due to dangerous road and travel conditions; and 
Whereas, Department of Education Rule Chapter 125 provides that a school board 
may reschedule cancelled school days by conducting classes on the weekend, 
rescheduling or shortening scheduled vacation periods or postponing the scheduled 
closing date of the school year; and 
Whereas, providing school administrative units with the additional option of adding 
make-up instructional time during existing school days would provide school boards with 
greater flexibility in determining how to meet the minimum school year calendar 
requirements; and 
Whereas, because Rule Chapter 125 is a major substantive rule, changes to the rule 
require legislative review before the changes may be made; and 
Whereas, the Legislature has the authority to direct the Department of Education to 
amend its rule to reflect legislative policy determinations; and 
Whereas, the Department of Education and school boards need statutory and rule 
revisions for the acceptable methods established for rescheduling cancelled school days 
in order for school administrative units to have another option to meet the minimum 
school year calendar requirements for this school year; and

Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase .-General Fund " 
Allowing school administrative units to extend a school day by one hour each day for up to 25 school days missed 
each school year due to weather or emergency closures may result in increased costs to local school administrative 
units. Because this provision is permissive, any additional costs will be paid as part of the budgeted resources of each 
individual school administrative unit. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with the rulemaking process can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
