Fiscal Note 
Easing of mandated requirement -alignment of calendar days 
Current law requires that there be no more than 5 instructional days in which one or more of the school calendars of 
school administrative units (SAO's) affiliated with a career and technical education (CTE) center or within a CTE 
region are not aligned with the regional school calendar. This legislation eases that mandated requirement, possibly 
reducing related planning and coordinating costs to SAO's, by increasing the number of days that calendars of the 
SAO's need not be aligned with their affiliated CTE center or CTE region and with the regional school calendar from 
no more than 5 days to no more than 7 days, depending on the number of schools sending students to a CTE school.
