SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. This amendment reduces 
3 the amount of the unappropriated surplus transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization 
4 Fund in fiscal year 2015-16 to $55,500,000 and eliminates the transfer in fiscal year 
5 2016-17. This amendment also establishes a priority for the transfer of the uncommitted 
6 balances after all required deductions of appropriations, budgeted financial commitments 
7 and adjustments considered necessary by the State Controller have been made in fiscal 
8 year 2015-16. The first priority is that 90% of the unappropriated surplus is transferred to 
9 the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund; the remaining 10% is distributed on a priority basis 
10 in the same manner as specified in the so-called cascade established in the Maine Revised 
11 Statutes, Title 5, section 1536, including requiring 80% of the funds remaining after those 
12 distributions to be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund and 20% 
13 transferred to the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents.
