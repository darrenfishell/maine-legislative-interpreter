section  sections  17806 and 17806 -A. 18 
Sec. 2.  4 MRSA §1358, sub -§1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 380, Pt. 19 
T, §9, is amended to read:  20 
1.  Cost -of-living adjustment s.  Except as provided in subsection 2, paragraph A, 21

for members of the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program by Title 5, section  23 
sections  17806 and 17806 -A. 24 
Sec. 3.  5 MRSA §17806 -A is enacted to read:  25 
§17806 -A.  Cost -of-living adjustment to retirement benefits for retirees who are 26 
surviving members  27 
Notwithstanding section 17806, cost -of-living adjustments to the retirement benefits 28

1.  Determination of adjustment.  The cost -of-living adjustment is determined as 32 
follows.  33 
A.  Except as provided in paragraph B, whenever there is a percentage increase in the 34 
Consumer Price Index from July 1st to June 30th, the board shall automatically make 35 
an equal percentage increase in retirem ent benefits, beginning in September, up to a 36 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0145(01) -1 
 maximum annual increase of 4%.  The increase applies to that portion of the 1 
retirement benefit up to $20,000, which amount must be indexed in subsequent years 2 
by the same percentage adjustments granted under th is paragraph.  3 
B.  If there is a percentage decrease in the Consumer Price Index from July 1st to 4 
June 30th, the board shall set the percentage change at 0% for that September.  The 5 
adjustment for the following year must be set based on the actuarially comp ounded 6 
Consumer Price Index for both years in a cost -neutral manner.  If the Consumer Price 7 
Index in the subsequent year or years is not sufficient to allow for the adjustment to 8 
be cost -neutral for the 2 years, then the adjustment needed for cost -neutrali ty must 9 
continue to be applied to following years until such time as the cost -neutrality 10 
requirement is met.  11 
C.  Whenever the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from July 12 
1st to June 30th exceeds 4%, the board shall make whatever adjust ments in the 13 
retirement benefits are necessary to reflect an annual increase of 4% and shall submit 14 
a supplemental budget request to the Governor for the additional funds that would be 15

in the Consumer Price Index.  The request must include a report stating the cost of the 17 
4% increase, the actual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index and the 18 
percentage adjustments granted during the previous 5 years.  The board s hall make an 19 
additional adjustment in the retirement benefits in the month following the 20 
appropriation only in that amount.  21 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the amount of annual 22 
retirement benefit otherwise payable under this Part m ay not be less than the 23 
retirement benefit the surviving member received on the effective date of that 24 
surviving member's retirement or on July 1, 1977, whichever amount is greater.  25
