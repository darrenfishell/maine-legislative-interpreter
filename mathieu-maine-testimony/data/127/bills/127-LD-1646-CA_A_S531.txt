A dispenser who violates this provision is subject to a fine of $250 per incident, not to 
exceed $5,000 per calendar year. 
7. It provides that the failure of a health care provider who is a prescriber or 
dispenser to check the prescription monitoring information or to submit prescription 
monitoring information to the Department of Health and Human Services as required by 
law is grounds for discipline of that health care provider. 
8. It requires that a health care provider who is a prescriber of opioid medication or a 
veterinarian who is a prescriber of opioid medication must complete 3 hours every 2 
years of continuing education related to opioid medication prescribing practices. 
9. It sets limits on the supply of opioid medication that may be prescribed to a patient 
to 7 days for acute pain and 30 days for chronic pain beginning January 1, 2017. 
10. It sets limits on the amount of opioid medication that may be prescribed to no 
more than 100 morphine milligram equivalents for new prescriptions beginning on the 
effective date of this legislation. For patients who have prescriptions that total over 100 
morphine milligram equivalents on the effective date of this legislation, the prescribing 
limit is 300 morphine milligram equivalents; those patients must be tapered to a level of 
no more than 100 morphine milligram equivalents by July 1, 2017. 
11. It establishes statutory exceptions to opioid medication limits and requires the 
Department of Health and Human Services to adopt rules for other exceptions. The rules 
must be adopted by January 1, 2017.

directly administering medication to a patient in an emergency room setting, inpatient 
hospital setting, long-term care setting or residential care setting. 
13. It provides immunity for pharmacists who dispense opioid medication over 100 
morphine milligram equivalents in accordance with a prescription. 
14. It requires prescribers to electronically prescribe opioid medication if the 
capability exists. A prescriber who does not have the capability for electronic prescribing 
must seek a waiver from the Commissioner of Health and Human Services listing the 
reasons why the prescriber is unable to electronically prescribe. Pharmacists must be able 
to receive electronic prescriptions of opioid medication or seek a waiver. 
15. It requires pharmacists and veterinarians who prescribe opioid medication to 
register with the Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program. 
16. It authorizes pharmacists to partially fill prescriptions of schedule II controlled 
substances upon request from the patient.

Insurance to evaluate the effect of prescription limits on out-of-pocket costs and report on 
options to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health 
and human services matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having
