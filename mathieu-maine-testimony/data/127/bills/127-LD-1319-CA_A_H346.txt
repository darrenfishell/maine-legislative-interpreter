FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 897, L.D. 1319, Bill, "An Act To 
Ensure That Wages and Benefits of Maine State Employees Serve a Public Purpose" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Study the Effect of Compensated Union Leave in State Collective 
Bargaining Contracts' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the State is party to collective bargaining contracts that allow employees 
the right to compensated leave for activities involving the employees' collective 
bargaining agent, also known as union leave or organizational leave; and 
Whereas, these collective bargaining agent activities have no bearing on the tasks 
for which such state employees have been hired by the State; and 
Whereas, it is currently unclear the extent of the impact of compensated union leave 
on state resources and the benefit of such leave to the State; and 
Whereas, state resources are extremely limited and it is in the best interest of the 
citizens of the State that state resources are spent as efficiently as possible; and 
Whereas, the study authorized by this resolve must be initiated before the 90-day 
period expires in order that the study may be completed and a report produced in time for 
submission to the next legislative session; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it
