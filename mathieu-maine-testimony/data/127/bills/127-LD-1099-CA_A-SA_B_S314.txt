This floor amendment repeals the fee effective 5-1-17 and would result in a decrease in General Fund revenue ill the 
next biennium as compared to the committee amendment. 
The amendment requires the Pesticides Control Board within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry (ACF) to provide certain retail stores with product codes for evelY type of pesticide container that may be 
sold by that store by January 1, 2016. The committee amendment required ACF to perform this annually. This 
amendment removes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $78,855 in fiscal year 2016-17 to hire a contractor to 
assist ACF in providing product codes and for other related costs due to this now being a one-time activity. The 
amendment removes the transfer from the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund to ACF for reimbursing 
costs to provide product codes for pesticide containers. ACF will administer this fund beginning May 1,2017. 
As amended, this bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of 192,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$340,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund at the University of Maine 
Cooperative Extension for outreach and education initiatives on pest management and pest safety and for non~ 
administrative costs related to its animal and plant disease and insect control laboratory.
