6 Sec. 20. Application. That section of this Act that amends the Maine Revised

10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment is the minority report the committee. It provides conformity with 
12 the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the same manner as the majority report but only for 
13 tax years beginning in 2015. 
14 This amendment decouples the Maine individual and corporate income taxes from the 
15 federal bonus depreciation deductions for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 
16 2015. In addition, it provides a Maine capital investment credit for taxable years 
17 beginning in 2015 with respect to depreciable property placed in service in Maine. The 
18 credit is equal to 9% of the amount of the net increase in depreciation attributable to the 
19 depreciation deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the United States Internal Revenue 
20 Code of 1986, Section l 68(k) with respect to property placed in service in the State 
21 during the taxable year for taxable corporations; for individuals the credit is 8% of such 
22 amount for tax years beginning in 2015. 
23 The amendment also decouples Maine's individual and corporate income tax from 
24 the Code, Section 179 expensing deductions for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 
25 2016. It enacts addition and subtraction modifications to reverse any increase allowed at 
26 the federal level for the first year the property is placed in service, and then to allow 
27 depreciation deductions for the remainder of the asset's life. 
28 The amendment decouples Maine's individual income tax from the teacher expense 
29 deduction under the Code, Section 62(a)(2)(D) by requiring an addition modification in 
30 the amount of the federal deduction. 
31 The amendment disallows for Maine itemized deduction purposes the federal 
32 deduction for mortgage insurance premiums treated as qualified residence interest. 
33 For taxable years beginning after 2017, the amendment decouples the Maine earned 
34 income tax credit from the increased federal 45% earned income tax credit rate for 
35 taxpayers with 3 or more qualifying children and from the higher phase-out thresholds for 
36 married individuals filing joint returns.
