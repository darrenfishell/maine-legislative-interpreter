127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 625, L.D. 1574, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Maine Voters from Intimidating Videotaping at the Polls" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Protect Maine Voters from Intimidating Video Recording at the Polls' 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 4 (page 1, lines 4 to 11 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'4. Outside the guardrail enclosure. If sufficient space exists, party workers and 
others, in addition to the pollwatchers allowed pursuant to section 627, may remain in the 
voting place outside the guardrail enclosure as long as they do not attempt to influence 
voters or interfere with their free passage. If a person attempts to influence voters or 
interfere with their free passage, the warden shall have the person removed from the 
voting place. A person video recording in the voting place must remain outside the 
guardrail and may not conduct video recording closer than 15 feet from a voter being 
recorded, including when a voter is where a person is collecting voters' signatures. A 
person who video records a voter in violation of this subsection may be removed from the 
voting place at the direction of the warden as provided in section 662, subsection 2.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the term 
"videotaping" with "video recording." It also clarifies that video recording a voter in 
violation of the 15-foot buffer established by the bill may result in the person's being 
removed from the voting place at the direction of the warden.
