statewide 
The required local activities in this bill may represent a State mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. Unless 
General Fund appropriations are provided to fund at least 90% of the additional costs or a Mandate Preamble is 
amended to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt this mandate from the funding 
requirement, municipalities may not be required to implement these changes. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The Department of Education has indicated that it does not have the resources available to support local school 
administrative units with the transition to a blended system of graduation requirements. The ability of the department 
to implement the requirements of this legislation without impacting other programs and services it already provides 
can not be determined at this time.
