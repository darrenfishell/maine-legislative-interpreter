SUMMARY  13 
Under current law, the excise tax imposed on the sale of motor vehicles, except for 14 
commercial motor vehicles manufactured in model year 1996 and after and buses 15 
manufactured in model year 2006 and after, and camper trailers is based on the maker's 16 
list price of the motor vehicle or camper trailer.  17 
This bill requires the excise tax on motor vehicles  and camper trailers to be based on 18 
the purchase price of the motor vehicle or camper trailer.  The purchase price is 19 
determined for new motor vehicles and camper trailers based on the initial bill of sale or 20 
state sales tax document.  For used motor vehic les and camper trailers, if the initial bill of 21 
sale or state sales tax document is not available, the excise tax is based on the maker's list 22 
price.  23 
Current law requires the State to reimburse a municipality for the difference in excise 24 
tax collected due to the tax being imposed on the purchase price, rather than the maker's 25 
list price, of a commercial motor vehicle or bus.  This bill extends that reimbursement 26 
requirement to the difference in excise tax collected on all motor vehicles based on the 27 
purchas e price.  28
