 employees for the same job  classification.  A part -time employee's eligibility for 1 
employer -provided paid or unpaid time off may be prorated based on the number of hours 2 
that the part -time employee works.  3 
3.  Eligibility for promotions.   Employers shall provide part -time employees with 4 
the same eligibility for promotions as that afforded to full -time employees for the same 5 
job classification, except that an employer may condition eligibility for promotion on the 6 
employee's availability for full -time employment and on reasons other t han the part -time 7 
status of the employee, such as the nature and amount of the employee's work experience.  8 
§3504.  Offering additional work to part -time employees  9 
1.  Offer required.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, before hiring new 10 
employee s or using contractors or workers from a temporary services or staffing agency 11 
to perform work in a retail establishment, an employer must first offer the additional 12 
work to an existing part -time employee or employees if:  13

reasonably determined by the employer; and  15 
B.  The additional work is the same or similar to work the part -time employee or 16 
employees have performed for the retail establishment.  17 
An employer is required to offer to a part -time employee only the number of hours 18 
required to give the employee more than 30 hours of work in a week.  19 
2.  Employer discretion.   An employer has discretion to divide the additional work 20 
hours among part -time employees consistent with th is section.  21 
3.  Acceptance not required.   A part -time employee is not required to accept the 22 
employer's offer of additional work hours under this section.  23

a part -time emp loyee, the employer shall make the offer in writing and shall retain each 25 
written offer for no less than 3 years as required under section 3506.  26 
§3505.  Notice of employee rights  27 
1.  Notice.   The bureau shall publish and make available to employers, in Eng lish, 28 
Spanish, French and all languages spoken by more than 5% of the workforce in this State, 29 
a notice suitable for posting by employers in the workplace informing applicants and 30 
employees of their rights under this chapter.  The bureau shall update this notice on 31 
December 1st of any year in which there is a change in the languages spoken by more 32 
than 5% of the workforce of this State.  33 
2.  Posting of notice.   An employer shall post the notice described in subsection 1 in 34 
a conspicuous place at every workpl ace, job site or other location in this State under the 35

 Page 5 - 127LR0979(01) -1 
 §3506.  Requirements governing retention of records  1 
An employer shall retain work schedule and payroll records pertaining to employees 2 
for 3 years and shall allow the bureau access to the records, with appropriate notice and 3 
during business hours, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this chapter.  4 
The bureau may have access to all places of labor subject to this chapter during 5 
business hours to inspect books and records, interview employees and investigate such 6 
matters necessary or appropriate to determine whether an employer has violated any 7 
provisions of this chapter.  If an employer does not maintain or retain adequate records 8 
documenting compliance with this chapter or does not allow the bureau reasonable acce ss 9 
to the records, it must be presumed that the employer did not comply with this chapter, 10 
absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  11 
§3507.  Exercise of rights protected; retaliation prohibited  12 
1.  Rights.   An employer or any other person may n ot interfere with, restrain or deny 13 
the exercise or the attempt to exercise any right protected under this chapter.  An 14 
employer or any other person may not discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend 15 
or otherwise take adverse employment action again st any employee in retaliation for 16 
exercising rights protected under this chapter.  These rights include but are not limited to:  17 
A.  The right to request a modification to the initial proposed work schedule provided 18 
under section 3502;  19 
B.  The right to inf orm any person about an employer's alleged violation of this 20 
chapter;  21 
C.  The right to file a complaint with the bureau alleging a violation of this chapter;  22 
D.  The right to cooperate with the bureau or other persons in the investigation or 23 
prosecution of  any alleged violation of this chapter;  24 
E.  The right to oppose any policy, practice or act that is unlawful under this chapter; 25 
and 26 
F.  The right to inform any person of the person's rights under this chapter.  27 
2.  Retaliation.   Taking adverse action again st an employee within 90 days of the 28 
employee's exercise of rights protected under this chapter raises a rebuttable presumption 29 
that the party taking the adverse action did so in retaliation for the exercise of those 30 
rights.  31 
§3508.  Investigation and compl aints  32 
1.  Investigation.   The bureau may investigate possible violations of this chapter.  33 
2.  Complaints.   An employee or other person may report to the bureau any 34 
suspected violation of this chapter.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, the name 35 
and o ther identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation is 36 
confidential except that, with the authorization of the employee or person reporting the 37 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0979(01) -1 
 violation, the bureau may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying 1 
information as necessary to enforce this chapter or for other appropriate purposes.  2 
3.  Bureau discretion.   The bureau's decision to investigate or pursue a violation of 3 
this chapter is solely at the bureau's discretion.  The filing of a report of a suspecte d 4 
violation by an employee does not create any right of appeal to the bureau by the 5 
employee.  6 
§3509.  Penalties  7 
1.  Civil violation.   An employer that violates any provision of this chapter commits 8 
a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $50 pe r day for each day or portion of a 9 
day that the violation occurred or continued may be adjudged.  10 
2.  Civil action.   The Attorney General may bring an action to enjoin violations of 11 
this chapter and for any other available remedy, including, but not limited  to, the payment 12 
of lost wages and payment of an additional sum as liquidated damages in an amount not 13 
to exceed lost wages, reinstatement and reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  This action 14 
and an action to prosecute the civil violation pursuant to sub section 1 may be joined in 15 
the same proceeding.  Notwithstanding Title 14, section 1602 -C, the court shall award 16 
interest at a rate of 10% per annum on all amounts due and unpaid.  17 
§3510.  No limitation of other rights and remedies  18 
This chapter does not in any way limit the rights and remedies that the law otherwise 19 
provides to employees, including, but not limited to, the rights to be free from wrongful 20 
termination and unlawful discrimination.  21 
§3511.  Rules  22 
The Department of Labor may adopt routine technica l rules, as defined in Title 5, 23 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, to implement the provisions of this chapter.  The rules must 24 
be consistent with this chapter and may establish procedures for ensuring fair, efficient 25 
and cost -effective implementation and enforc ement of this chapter, including procedures 26 
for helping to inform employees of their rights under this chapter and for monitoring 27 
employer compliance.  28 
§3512.  Report  29 
By no later than January 1, 2016, January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018, and no later 30 
than J anuary 1st of every even -numbered year thereafter, the bureau shall provide a 31 
written report regarding this chapter to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 32 
having jurisdiction over labor matters.  The report must include, but not be limited to, a 33 
discussion of the implementation and enforcement of this chapter, including the number 34 
of violations and the penalties assessed in the prior year, or prior 2 years starting with the 35 
report due by January 1, 2020.  The report may also include recommendati ons for 36 
possible improvements to this chapter.  37
