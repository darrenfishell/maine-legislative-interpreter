Like the bill, this amendment implements recommendations of the Commission To 
Strengthen and Align the Services Provided to Maine's Veterans. This amendment also 
combines proposals from 5 Legislative Documents, L.D. 1343, L.D. 1590, L.D. 1611, 
L.D. 1612 and L.D. 1625, that improve the delivery of services and benefits to Maine 
veterans and provide tuition assistance to members of the Maine National Guard. 
Part A requires the Director of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' Services within the 
Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management to include marketing and 
outreach objectives as a core function of the bureau. The marketing and outreach 
objectives are intended to identify residents in the State who are veterans and also to 
maximize awareness of benefits and services available to veterans and family members of 
veterans. Part A also directs the bureau to acquire and implement an electronic records 
management system to create efficiencies and provide timely and effective customer 
service to veterans seeking assistance from the bureau. The bureau is required to serve as 
the primary source of information for veterans regarding the services, benefits and honors 
provided to veterans. Part A requires the director to employ 2 additional veteran service 
officers who are not assigned to a particular region but who will be directed to where the 
service needs of veterans are greatest and makes a current temporary position of outreach 
coordinator permanent. 
Part B proposes changes to current law to address homelessness among veterans by 
requmng coordination of agencies that provide services to veterans to maximize 
resources available to support stable, permanent housing for veterans at risk of

homelessness. Part B requires that the Director of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' 
Services within the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management be 
appointed to an existing entity, the Statewide Homeless Council. Part B requires the 
Statewide Homeless Council to develop a strategic plan to maximize existing services, 
enhance communication among providers and improve access to services that support 
permanent and stable housing for veterans. The director is required to report annually to 
the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over veterans affairs 
regarding the implementation of the plan and its effect on homelessness among veterans. 
Part B authorizes the director to employ a veteran service officer whose duties include 
working on tasks relative to homelessness among veterans. 
Part C provides a sales tax exemption to all federally chartered veterans' service 
organizations, beginning August 1, 2016. 
Part D establishes the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund to provide for a 
100% tuition waiver at any state postsecondary education institution for qualified 
members of the Maine National Guard. Part D also transfers funds to the new fund for 
the costs of the tuition waiver program. 
Part E directs the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College 
System to identify the needs of student-veterans on their campuses, including needs 
related to admission, degree completion, transitioning to civilian life and meeting 
personal and financial obligations, and directs the University of Maine System and the 
Maine Community College System to identify existing services that meet the needs 
identified, assess the effectiveness of those services, determine what services are not 
being offered that, if offered, would meet those needs and propose services and solutions 
that fulfill those needs across campuses that are based upon best practices. 
Part F provides for allocations to fund the initiatives proposed in this amendment 
including deappropriating debt service funds from the University of Maine in order to 
fund the tuition waiver for qualified members of the Maine National Guard and 
transferring funds from the Gambling Control Board necessary to offset the costs of the 
other initiatives.

This amendment deappropriates $2,500,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 from the Debt Service -University of Maine 
System program within the University of Maine System on a one-time basis due to a delay in the issuance of an 
estimated $21,000,000 university revenue bond. The delay will move the debt service payments approved in Public 
Law 2015, Chapter 267 forward by one year and will end in fiscal year 2025-26. It also transfers the $2,500,000 to 
the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund to 
increase access to postsecondary education for National Guard members. 
The amendment transfers $628, 720 from the Gambling Control Board administrative expenses, Other Special 
Revenue Funds account within the Department of Public Safety to the General Fund unappropriated surplus in fiscal 
year 2016-17. This account has sufficient resources to accommodate this transfer. 
The amendment adds a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
Management for one Veterans Service Officer position and related costs. 
This bill provides a sales tax exemption to all federally-chartered veterans' service organizations. It would result in a 
loss of General Fund revenue of $80,546 in fiscal year 2016-17 and a loss to the Local Government Fund of $1,643 in 
fiscal year 2016-17.
