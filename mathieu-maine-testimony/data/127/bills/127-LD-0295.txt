 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §636 -A, sub -§1, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 270, Pt. D, §8, 2 
is amended to read:  3 
A.  "Tidal energy demonstration project" or "project" means a hydropower project 4 
that uses either in-stream  tidal action or the difference between water levels on either 5 
side of a marine enclosure  as a source of electrical power and that:  6 
(1)  Has a total net installed generating capacity of 5 25 megawatts or less; and  7 
(2)  Is proposed for the prima ry purpose of testing new or advanced  tidal energy 8 
generation technology  technologies , which may include a mooring or anchoring 9 
system and, transmission line, turbine designs and construction techniques,  and 10 
collecting and assessing information on the envi ronmental and other effects of 11 
the technology  technologies . 12 
Sec. 2.  PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. A, §6, 3rd ¶  is amended to read:  13 
Subject to the requirements of this section, the commission may direct one or more 14 
transmission and distribution utilities, as approp riate, to enter into a long -term contract 15 
for an initial term  of up to 20 years and with an option, exercisable at the commission's 16 
discretion, for one or more renewal terms up to a maximum aggregate extension period of 17 
25 years  for the installed capacity and associated renewable energy and renewable energy 18 
credits of one or more deep -water offshore wind energy pilot projects or tidal energy 19 
demonstration projects.  20 
Sec. 3.  PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. A, §6, sub -§1, first sentence is amended to read:  21 
Following rev iew of proposals submitted in response to the a competitive solicitation, the 22 
commission may negotiate with one or more potential suppliers to supply an aggregate 23 
total of no more than 30 45 megawatts of installed capacity and associated renewable 24 
energy a nd renewable energy credits from deep -water offshore wind energy pilot projects 25 
or tidal energy demonstration projects as long as no more than 5 30 megawatts of the total 26 
is supplied by tidal energy demonstration projects.  27 
Sec. 4.  Competitive solicitation  of proposals for tidal energy 28 
demonstration projects.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Public 29 
Utilities Commission shall conduct an additional competitive solicitation of proposals as 30 
described in Public Law 2009, chapter 615, Part A, sect ion 6, as amended, for tidal 31 
energy demonstration projects as soon as practicable after the effective date of this 32 
section.  The commission shall make all reasonable efforts to complete its review of 33 
proposals under this solicitation and finalize a long -term contract as soon as practicable 34 
after initiating this solicitation.  The long -term contract may not result in an increase in 35 
electric rates in any customer class that is greater than the amount of the assessment 36 
charged under the Maine Revised Statutes,  Title 35 -A, section 10110, former subsection 37 
4 at the time the long -term contract is entered into, after taking into account any increase 38 
in those electric rates from the sale of energy under any other long -term contract entered 39 
into with a tidal energy d emonstration project or deep -water offshore wind energy pilot 40 
project finalized prior to the long -term contract finalized pursuant to this section.  41

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill expands the definition of "tidal energy demonstration project" under the 2 
laws governing ge neral permits for tidal energy demonstration projects to cover so -called 3 
tidal range projects, which extract energy from the differential head across a marine 4 
enclosure.  The bill further directs the Public Utilities Commission to conduct an 5 
additional com petitive solicitation of proposals for tidal energy demonstration projects 6 
and increases the allowed capacity derived from tidal energy demonstration projects to 30 7 
megawatts and total allowed capacity contracted for by the commission to 45 megawatts.  8
