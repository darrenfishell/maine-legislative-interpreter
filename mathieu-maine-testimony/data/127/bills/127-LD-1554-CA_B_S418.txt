SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment repeals 2 
conflicting versions of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1107-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph B, which was amended by Public Law 2015, chapter 308, section 
2 and chapter 346, section 6. The amendment resolves the conflict and enacts a new 
version of Title 17-A, section 1107-A, subsection 1, paragraph B. Under this 
amendment, and subject to other provisions of law that address the quantities of drugs 
possessed: 
1. The first offense of possession of heroin, methamphetamine, oxycodone, 
hydrocodone, hydromorphone or fentanyl powder, or cocaine in the form of cocaine base 
if the quantity possessed is 2 grams or more, is a Class D crime; 
2. The 2nd and subsequent offenses of possession of heroin, methamphetamine, 
oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone or fentanyl powder, or cocaine in the form of 
cocaine base if the quantity possessed is 2 grams or more, is a Class C crime; 
3. The first offense and the 2nd and subsequent offenses of possession of cocaine in 
the form of cocaine base if the quantity possessed is less than 2 grams is a Class D crime; 
and 
4. By the interaction of Title 17-A, section 1107-A, subsection 1, paragraphs A, B 
and C, the possession of cocaine in any quantity of 14 grams or less regardless of whether 
the offense is a first or subsequent offense is a Class D crime.
