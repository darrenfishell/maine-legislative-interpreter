SUMMARY  18 
This bill clarifies and strengthens the laws governing severance pay.  It adds 19 
definitions for "closing," "mass layoff," "part -time employee," "employme nt loss" and 20 
"gross earnings."  It provides that ambiguous language of an employer regarding the 21 
duration and nature of an employment loss may not be construed to prevent potential 22 
liability for payment of severance.  The bill changes the circumstances tha t mitigate 23 
liability for severance pay by adding the closing of a covered establishment that is 24 
necessitated by the final order of a federal, state or local government agency, including an 25 
adjudication of bankruptcy.  It amends the laws governing advance n otice of a closing so 26 
they conform to the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also 27 
known as the WARN Act, 29 United States Code, Sections 2101 to 2109 (2014) and 28 
changes the designation of rules from major substantive to routine tech nical.  29
