environmental impacts.  The criteria are as follows:  19 
A.  A municipal planning board or reviewing authority is established and the 20 
municipality has adequate resources to administer and enforce the provisions of its 21 
ordinances.  In determining wh ether this criterion is met, the commissioner may 22 
consider any specific and adequate technical assistance that is provided by a regional 23 
council;  24 
B.  The municipality has adopted a site plan review ordinance.  In determining the 25 
adequacy of the ordinance, the commissioner may consider model site plan review 26 
ordinances commonly used by municipalities in this State that address the issues 27 
reviewed under applicable provisions of this article prior to July 1, 1997;  28 
C.  The municipality has adopted subdivision r egulations.  In determining the 29

regulations commonly used by municipalities in this State; and  31 
D.  The former State Planning Office or the Department of Agriculture, Conservatio n 32 
and Forestry has determined that the municipality has a comprehensive land use plan 33

that a municipality has capacity pursuant to this subsection  is exempt as long as the  8 
modification will not cause the total area of the development to exceed the maximum 9 
acreage specified in this subsection for that type of development or, based upon 10

the department determines that the modification may be adequately reviewed by the 12 
municipality.  13
