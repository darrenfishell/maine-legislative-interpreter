This bill authorizes the establishment of marijuana testing facilities which would be licensed by the Department of 
Health and Human Services. Depending on the number of such facilities that get established, the department may 
require additional staff to provide oversight and conduct additional on-site visits. The Medical Use of Marijuana Fund 
currently has sufficient funding to accommodate some additional expenditures and the department may acquire 
additional revenue from establishing licensing fees. No estimate is made of the number of facilities that will be 
established.
