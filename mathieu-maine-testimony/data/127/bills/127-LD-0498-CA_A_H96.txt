127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 337, L.D. 498, Bill, "An Act To 
Restore the Super Credit for Substantially Increased Research and Development" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 36 MRSA ยง5219-L, sub-ยงl, as amended by PL 2013, c. 502, Pt. J, ยง1 
and affected by ยง3, is further amended to read: 
1. Super credit allowed for substantial expansions of research and development. 
For tax years beginning before January 1, 2014, a A taxpayer that qualifies for the 
research expense tax credit allowed under section 5219-K is allowed an additional credit 
against the tax due under this Part equal to the excess, if any, of qualified research 
expenses for the taxable year over the super credit base amount. For purposes of this 
section, "super credit base amount" means the average amount spent on qualified research 
expenses by the taxpayer in either the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the effective 
date of this section, increased by 50%, or, if the taxpayer has not claimed a credit under 
this section for the 3 consecutive taxable years immediately preceding January 1, 2014, 
the 3 taxable years immediately preceding January 1, 2014, increased by 50%. For 
purposes of this section, "qualified research expenses" has the same meaning as under the 
Code, Section 41 but applies only to expenditures for research conducted in this State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the definition of "super credit base amount" to provide that 
the base amount is reset if the taxpayer did not claim the super credit for 3 consecutive 
taxable years immediately prior to January 1, 2014.
