SUMMARY  17 
Current law regarding the physical examination and psychological assessment of 18 
children entering st ate custody requires the physical examination of a child within 10 19 
working days after the child enters into the custody of the Department of Health and 20 
Human Services and a psychological assessment within 30 days of the examination if an 21 
assessment is dete rmined appropriate by the doctor or nurse practitioner performing the 22 
physical examination.  This bill shortens the time requirement for the physical 23 
examination to 3 working days and replaces the language regarding the psychological 24 
examination with langu age requiring a comprehensive medical, dental, behavioral and 25 
educational assessment meeting the standards of a national academy of pediatrics within 26 
30 days after the department's custody of the child commences.  27
