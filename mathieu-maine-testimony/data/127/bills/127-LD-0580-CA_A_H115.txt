Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to pay 75% of the costs incurred before 
December 31, 2015 of closing municipal landfills that meet certain criteria. This bill extends that deadline to 
December 31, 2025. The DEP has indicated that there are at least two active landfills that are contemplating closure 
due to groundwater contamination indicators and that it would incur costs totaling $400,000 to $800,000 to close 
them. All costs to DEP will be funded by the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund within DEP. The fund has 
sufficient resources to absorb these costs from a $2 per ton fee on construction and demolition debris and residue.
