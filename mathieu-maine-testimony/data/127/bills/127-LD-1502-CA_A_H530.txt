SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. This amendment allows a 
license holder in the elver fishery to choose which type of elver fishing gear the license 
holder employs. This amendment allows the Commissioner of Marine Resources to enter 
into an agreement with a federally recognized Indian tribe that does not require allocation 
of individual quota, as long as all elvers caught by the tribe, nation or band with whom 
the commissioner has entered into the agreement are tracked using elver transaction cards 
and reporting requirements are met. This amendment provides that, in the absence of an 
agreement between the commissioner and a federally recognized Indian tribe, individual 
allocations of elver fishing quota are required. This amendment provides that the 
commissioner may adopt emergency rules to close the elver fishery to a federally 
recognized Indian tribe if the commissioner finds that the tribe, nation or band has 
authorized fishing under a license issued under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12 that 
will cause the tribe, nation or band to exceed its overall annual elver fishing quota. This 
amendment extends the end of the elver fishing season from May 31st to June 7th. This 
amendment removes the provision of law that prohibits the taking of elvers from noon 
Friday to noon Sunday. It also removes the prohibition on the use of an elver fyke net to 
take elvers from the St. Croix River and its tributaries.
