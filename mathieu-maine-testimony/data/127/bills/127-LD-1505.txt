Whereas, in ord er to meet the purpose of the tax credit and provide some relief to 8 
graduates with eligible student loans, it is imperative that any delays in providing this 9

Be it enacted by the People of the State o f Maine as follows:  15

Statutes, Titl e 36, section 5217 -D, subsection 2, paragraph B applies to tax years 19

Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 21 
legislation takes effect when approved.  22 
SUMMARY  23 
Currently, under the tax cre dit for educational opportunity, an individual is allowed a 24 
credit against income tax owed by that individual for payments made on qualified student 25 
loans used to obtain a postsecondary degree.  Prior to tax years beginning January 1, 26 
2016, however, if a s tudent loan eligible for the tax credit is consolidated with an 27 
ineligible loan, the otherwise eligible student loan is rendered ineligible by the 28 
consolidation.  Public Law 2015, chapter 267 allows an eligible student loan consolidated 29 
with an ineligible loan to be eligible for the tax credit, but only for tax years beginning on 30 
or after January 1, 2016.  31 
This bill provides that the change made by Public Law 2015, chapter 267 regarding 32 
consolidated student loans applies to tax years beginning on or after Ja nuary 1, 2015.  33
