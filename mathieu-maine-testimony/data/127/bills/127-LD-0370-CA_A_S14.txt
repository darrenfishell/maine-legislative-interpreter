Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill directs that 100% of registration fees from lobbyists and lobbyist associates be deposited into an Other 
Special Revenue Funds account within the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices 
(Commission). Under current law, 50% of these fees goes into the Commission's Other Special Revenue Funds 
account and 50% goes to the General Fund. This will reduce General Fund undedicated revenue and increase Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue credited to the Commission by an estimated $59,900 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$65,600 in fiscal year 2016-17.
