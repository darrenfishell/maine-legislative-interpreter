9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 'it " to S.P. 55, L.D. 122, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Standardize Pints of Beer Sold in Maine" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 28-A MRSA ยง1051, sub-ยง9 is enacted to read: 
14 9. Malt liquor sales in standardized pints. An on-premises retail licensee may not 
15 sell or offer for sale malt liquor in a container represented in any written form to patrons 
16 of the licensee as a pint, unless that container can hold at least 16 fluid ounces.' 
17 SUMMARY 
18 This amendment makes a technical change to the bill by placing it in the section of 
19 statute that applies to on-premises licensees specifically. It also clarifies that the 
20 requirement to have a container that holds 16 fluid ounces applies when the licensee 
21 represents in written form to patrons that the licensee sells malt liquor by the pint.
