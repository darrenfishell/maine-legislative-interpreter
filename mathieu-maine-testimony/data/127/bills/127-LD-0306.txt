38 Whereas, the current essential programs and services funding model for virtual 
public charter schools overpays for services, teachers and facilities that are not actually provided by the virtual public charter schools; and 
Whereas, further taxpayer money will be needless ly spent on overpayments if the 
current funding model for virtual public charter schools is not changed before the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year; and 
Whereas, the 2015-2016 school year will likely be gin before the expiration of the 
90-day period; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it 
Sec. 1.  Department of Education to design a different essential programs 
and services funding model for virtua l public charter school educational 
services.  Resolved:  That the Department of Educati on, in conjunction with the Maine 
Education Policy Research Institute, shall design an essential programs and services 
funding model for virtual public charter sc hool educational services different from the 
current model in that it must reflect eviden ce-based, appropriate costs, such as current 
staffing ratios, to determine the proper calculated per-pupil funding paid to a virtual 
public charter school; and be it further 
Sec. 2.  Report.  Resolved:  That the Department of Education shall report the 
revised funding model for virtual public ch arter schools and any recommended legislation 
to the Joint Standing Committee on Education a nd Cultural Affairs by June 1, 2015.  The 
Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs may report out a bill based on the report and recommended legislation to the First Regular Session of the 127th 
Legislature. 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved. 
SUMMARY 
This resolve requires the Depart
ment of Education in conjunction with the Maine

teachers and facilities that are not actually provided by the virtual public charter schools.  
This resolve requires the Department of Education to report the new funding model for 
virtual public charter schools to the Legislature by June 1, 2015.
