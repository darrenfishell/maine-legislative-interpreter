9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 487, L.D. 711, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Provide for a Later Starting Time for High Schools" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 20-A MRSA ยง4801, sub-ยง2-B is enacted to read: 
14 2-D. Start time. Beginning in school year 2017-2018, a school administrative unit

17 SUMMARY 
18 This amendment changes the earliest allowed school day start time for secondary 
19 schools proposed in the bill from 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and eliminates the requirement in 
20 the bill that a secondary school within a school administrative unit must allow 11 
21 consecutive hours between school activities and the next school day. This amendment
