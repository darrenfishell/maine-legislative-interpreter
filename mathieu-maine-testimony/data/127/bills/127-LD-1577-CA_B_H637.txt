The Commissioner of Health and Human Services shall without delay file the report 
with the court having jurisdiction of the case. The court shall hold a hearing on the 
question of the defendant's competence to stand trial and receive all relevant 
testimony bearing on the question. If the State Forensic Service's report or the report 
of another appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services to the 
court states that the defendant is either now competent or not restorable, the court 
shall within 30 days hold a hearing. If the court determines that the defendant is not 
competent to stand trial, but there does exist a substantial probability that the 
defendant will be competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future, the court shall 
recommit the defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human 
Services for placement in an appropriate program for observation, care and treatment 
of people with mental illness or persons with intellectual disabilities or autism. An 
appropriate program may be in an institution for the care and treatment of people 
with mental illness, an intermediate care facility for persons who have intellectual 
disabilities or autism, a crisis stabilization unit, a nursing home, a residential care 
facility, an assisted living facility, a hospice, a hospital, an intensive outpatient 
treatment program or any program specifically approved by the court. An appropriate 
program may be in a mental health unit of a correctional facility if, based upon a 
consensus recommendation of a panel, the Commissioner of Health and Human 
Services or the commissioner's designee determines that there is a therapeutic 
treatment advantage to placing the person in a mental health unit of a correctional 
facility. Placement of a person in a mental health unit of a correctional facility must 
be reviewed by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the 
commissioner's designee at least every 6 months and may not continue beyond 6 
months unless, based upon a subsequent review and consensus recommendation of a 
panel, the Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the commissioner's 
designee determines that there is a therapeutic treatment advantage to the continued 
placement of the person in a mental health unit of a correctional facility. When a 
person who has been evaluated on behalf of the court by the State Forensic Service or 
other appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services is 
committed into the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services 
under this paragraph, the court shall order that the State Forensic Service or other 
appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services share any 
information that it has collected or generated with respect to the person with the 
institution or residential program in which the person is placed. If the defendant is 
charged with an offense under Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11 or 13 or Title 17-A, section 
506-A, 802 or 803-A and the court determines that the defendant is not competent to 
stand trial and there does not exist a substantial probability that the defendant can be 
competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall dismiss all charges against the 
defendant and, unless the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of 
imprisonment, order the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to commence 
proceedings pursuant to Title 34-B, chapter 3, subchapter 4. If the defendant is 
charged with an offense other than an offense under Title 17-A, chapter 9, 11 or 13 or 
Title 17-A, section 506-A, 802 or 803-A and the court determines that the defendant 
is not competent to stand trial and there does not exist a substantial probability that 
the defendant can be competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall dismiss all 
charges against the defendant and, unless the defendant is subject to an undischarged 
term of imprisonment, notify the appropriate authorities, who may institute civil

8 this placement option to the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, at which time 
9 the law will revert to the previous version of statute, which does not offer such an option.
