 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1932, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 2015, c. 296, Pt. A, §1 and 2 
affected by Pt. D, §1, is amended to read:  3 
4.  Reasonable expenses.  A Except as provided in section 1939, a  gestat ional carrier 4 
agreement may provide for payment of reasonable expenses, which, if paid to a 5 
prospective gestational carrier, must be negotiated in good faith between the parties.  6 
Sec. 2.  19-A MRSA §1939 is enacted to read:  7 
§1939.  Liability for payment of  gestational carrier and child's medical expenses  8 
1.  Joint and several liability for medical expenses.  The gestational carrier and 9 
each intended parent are jointly and severally liable for the medical expenses of the 10 
gestational carrier and, notwithstand ing section 1932, subsection 3, paragraph J, 11 
subparagraph (4), division (b) and section 1933, of the resulting child.  As used in this 12 
section, "medical expenses" means all medical care provided for assisted reproduction, 13 
prenatal care, labor and delivery and 60 days of postpartum medical care related to the 14 
pregnancy and the health of the resulting child.  15 
2.  Effect of conflicting terms or breach of agreement.  If a term of a gestational 16 
carrier agreement is in conflict with the requirements of subsection 1, that term of the 17 
gestational carrier agreement is void and unenforceable.  The breach of a gestational 18 
carrier agreement by a party to the agreement does not relieve the gestational carrier or an 19 
intended parent from the liability for medical expenses i mposed pursuant to subsection 1.  20 
3.  Effect on insurance coverage.  This section is not intended to supplant any 21 
insurance coverage that is otherwise available to the gestational carrier or an intended 22 
parent for the coverage of medical expenses.  23 
SUMMARY  24 
Under the Maine Parentage Act, immediately upon the birth of a child that is the 25 
result of a gestational carrier agreement, all parental rights and responsibilities vest 26 
exclusively in the intended parent or parents.  27 
This bill specifies that medical costs o f the gestational carrier and the child, including 28 
the costs related to assisted reproduction and the pregnancy, including labor and delivery, 29 
and postpartum pregnancy -related medical care for 60 days following the birth, are 30 
jointly and severally the resp onsibility of the gestational carrier and each intended parent.  31 
The bill prohibits the waiver of this responsibility and specifies that a breach of the 32 
gestational carrier agreement does not change the status of the responsibility.  Finally, 33 
this bill spe cifies that these provisions are not intended to relieve insurance carriers of 34 
their obligation to provide coverage for their insureds.  35
