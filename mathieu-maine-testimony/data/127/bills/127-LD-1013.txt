 SUMMARY  1

clarifies that when a pregnant prisoner or detainee is admitted to a medical fac ility or 5 
birthing center, a corrections officer may not be present in the room during labor or 6 
childbirth unless specifically requested by medical personnel. The bill also requires the 7 
adoption of policies on the treatment of pregnant prisoners and detaine es and requires that 8 
information about those policies be disseminated to all prisoners and detainees.  9
