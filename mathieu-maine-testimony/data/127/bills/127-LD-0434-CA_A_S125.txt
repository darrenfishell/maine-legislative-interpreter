10 COMMTTIEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 163, L.D. 434 
The bill eliminates joint and several liability for a defendant who is less than 50% at 
fault while this amendment retains joint and several liability for pecuniary damages and 
in certain circumstances. This amendment provides that, if 2 or more defendants are 
found to be liable for a plaintiffs injury, then the defendants are jointly and severally 
liable for the plaintiffs pecuniary damages, but each defendant is only severally liable for 
nonpecuniary damages proportionate to the percentage of fault attributable to that 
defendant. If the defendants acted in concert, they are jointly and severally liable for the 
nonpecuniary damages as well.
