SUMMARY  8 
This bill changes the determination for property fiscal capacity as used to determine 9 
the amount of state aid a school administ rative unit receives under the school funding 10 
formula if a municipality has experienced a decline in state valuation of at least 4.5% 11 
attributable to one taxpayer.  Under this bill, the State Tax Assessor is required to certify 12 
to the Commissioner of Educa tion when a municipality's state valuation has declined by 13 
at least 4.5% from the previous year's certified state valuation and the decline is due to 14 
the loss in value attributable to a single taxpayer.  When those conditions have been met, 15 
the property fi scal capacity for that municipality is the average of the most recently 16 
certified state valuation and the certified state valuations for the 3 years prior to the most 17 
recently certified year.  18 
This bill requires the Commissioner of Education to identify sav ings from unused 19 
debt service in order to maintain the mill rate expectation of 8.30 for fiscal year 2016 -17. 20
