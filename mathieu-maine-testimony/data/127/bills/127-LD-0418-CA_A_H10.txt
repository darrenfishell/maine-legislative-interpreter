Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Requiring the University of Maine System's Education Research Institute to study the use of social impact bonds to 
fund extended learning programs and prekindergarten programs and to submit a report to the Joint Standing 
Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs by December 2,2015 is estimated to cost $18,750 in fiscal year 2015-
16. 
The Governor's proposed budget for the 2016-2017 biennium includes funding within the Department of Education's 
General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program of $250,0010 in both fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 to support the 
work of the institute which was established by the Legislature in Public Law 1995, c. 395, Part J to collect and 
analyze education information and perform targeted education research for the Legislature. 
This preliminary fiscal impact statement assumes that funding for the Education Research Institute in the 2016-2017 
biennial budget will be sufficient to support the costs of this legislation and the study will be included in the 2015-
2016 workplan approved by the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs and, therefore, no 
General Fund appropriation is required. This estimate of fiscal impact may need to be revised based on the final 
legislative actions in the first regular session of the 127th Legislature.
