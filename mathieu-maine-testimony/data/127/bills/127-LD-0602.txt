other states or a n umber of states with a collective population of 30,000,000  have enacted 5

SUMMARY  11 
Current law provides that the prohibition on the sale of motor fuel containing corn - 12 
based ethanol does not take effect until at least 10 other states or a number of states with a 13 
collective population of 30,000,000 have enacted laws that prohibit the sale of motor fuel 14 
containing corn -based ethanol.  This bill amends the law to provide that  this prohibition 15 
takes effect only if at least 3 other states have enacted laws that prohibit the sale of motor 16 
fuel containing corn -based ethanol.  17
