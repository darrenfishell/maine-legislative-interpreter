26 SUMMARY 
27 This amendment strikes the provision of the bill that clarifies that a registration plate 
28 may not be obscured by a plate frame or covering or other device that prevents the plate 
29 from being read visually or electronically. 
30 This amendment strikes from the bill the repeal of the provision of law that allows a 
31 person who has reached 15 years of age to obtain a special restricted license based on 
32 educational, employment or medical need without having held a learner's permit for a 
33 period of 6 months. Under current law, a person who is 15 years of age to 20 years of age 
34 can obtain a special restricted license. The amendment instead limits the special 
35 restricted license only to a person who is 15 years of age. Current law provides that a 
36 person seeking to qualify for a special restricted license based on educational or 
37 employment need must complete a minimum of 70 hours of driving, including 10 hours 
38 of night driving. The amendment increases the minimum driving time required of a

27 COMMIITEE AMENDMENT .. p. "to S.P. 581, L.D. 1483 
person who is seeking to qualify for a special restricted license based on medical need 
from 35 hours to 70 hours, including 10 hours of night driving instead of the current 5 
hours. The amendment gives the Secretary of State discretion to reduce the required 
minimum hours of driving for a person seeking to qualify for a special restricted license 
based on medical need. 
The amendment also strikes from the bill the provisions that require antique autos and 
antique motorcycles manufactured after 1991 to be subject to biennial inspection. 
The amendment strikes the requirement in current law that the Secretary of State may 
not issue a certificate of title or certificate of salvage for a vehicle reported stolen or 
converted until the Secretary of State learns of that vehicle's recovery or that the report of 
theft or conversion was erroneous. This is an obsolete requirement as the Department of 
the Secretary of State, Bureau of Motor Vehicles works with insurance companies and 
salvage companies when issuing certificates on vehicles reported stolen. 
The amendment changes the year the Department of Transportation is reviewed 
pursuant to the State Government Evaluation Act from 2015 to 2017. 
Current law provides that the excise tax on a motor vehicle owned by a nonresident 
with no temporary or occasional residing place in the State must be paid to the Secretary 
of State. This amendment provides that the excise tax paid to the Secretary of State by a 
nonresident with no temporary or occasional residing place in the State must be credited 
to the Highway Fund. 
The amendment clarifies that the term "IFTA governing documents" under the 
Special Fuel Tax Act refers to International Fuel Tax Agreement documents amended as 
of July 15, 2015 rather than December 31, 2011. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section and an 
emergency preamble and emergency clause.

The bill includes a Highway Fund allocation of $12,695 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $39,700 in fiscal year 2016-17 to 
the Department of Secretary of State for position reorganizations. The bill also proposes to change the crediting of 
excise tax from nonresidents from the General Fund to the Highway Fund and would increase Highway Fund revenue 
by $3 8 ,428 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $230,568 in fiscal year 2016-17 with a c01Tesponding decrease in General Fund 
revenue.
