 CONCEPT DRAFT  1 
SUMMARY  2 
This resolve is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  3 
This resolve proposes to require the Department of Education to analyze the data for 4 
the last 3 academic years from public and private secondary schools regarding the 5 
number of students needing remedial education at the postsecondary level and the 6 
graduation rates of those students from postsecondary programs.  The department is 7 
required to determine what methods are used by those schools with high graduation rates 8 
among stude nts requiring remedial education and determine how to use those methods in 9 
other schools that do not have graduation rates as high.  This resolve provides 10 
$1,000,000, disbursed by the department, to assist schools with low rates of graduation 11 
among its rem edial education students to adopt methods of increasing the graduation rates 12 
of those students.  13
