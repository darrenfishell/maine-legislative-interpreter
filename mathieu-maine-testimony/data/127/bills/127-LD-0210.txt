use of criminal history record information about an eligible criminal conviction.  To be 19 
eligible for the special restrictions, a person must file a motion with the court in the 20 
underlying criminal proceeding.  21 
The Department of Public Safety, Bureau of State Police, State Bureau of 22 
Identification upon receipt of a court order must promptly alter its re cords relating to the 23 
person's qualifying criminal conviction to reflect that future dissemination of this criminal 24 
history record information must be pursuant to the new procedure and is required to 25 
notify all prior recipients who have received that infor mation within the year prior to the 26 
court order of the change. It must also notify the person of compliance with that 27 
requirement and of the prior recipients notified.  28 
If the person is convicted of a subsequent crime, the person is required to file a 29 
writt en notice in the underlying criminal proceeding.  30 
The criminal history record information relating to the eligible criminal conviction is 31 
confidential and may not be disseminated by a criminal justice agency, whether directly 32 
or through any intermediary, ex cept to the person and to a criminal justice agency for the 33 
purpose of the administration of criminal justice and criminal justice agency employment.  34 
Unlawfully releasing the restricted information is a violation of the release of confidential 35 
information  under the criminal history record information laws.  36
