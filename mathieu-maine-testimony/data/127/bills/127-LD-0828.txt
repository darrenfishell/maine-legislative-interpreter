 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
PART A  2 
Sec. A -1.  12 MRSA §685 -A, sub -§13, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. C, §1, 3 
is amended to read:  4 
13.  Additions to and removals from the expedited permitting area and the 5 
provisional exp edited permitting area for wind energy development.  The 6 
commission may add areas in the State's unorganized and deorganized areas  specified 7 
places  to the expedited permitting area and remove specified places from the provisional 8 
expedited permitting area  for wind energy development in accordance with Title 35 -A, 9 
section 3453.  10 
Sec. A -2.  35-A MRSA §3402, sub -§2, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §5 11 
and amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended to read:  12 
2.  Need for modification of regulatory process for siting wind energy 13 
developments.  The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to reduce the 14 
potential for controversy regarding siting of grid -scale wind energy development by 15 
expediting development in places where it is most compat ible with existing patterns of 16 
development and resource values when considered broadly at the landscape level.  17 
Accordingly, the Legislature finds that certain aspects of the State's regulatory process for 18 
determining the environmental  acceptability of win d energy developments should be 19 
modified to encourage the siting of wind energy developments in these areas.  Such 20 
changes include, but are not limited to:  21 
A.  Making  Establishing a participatory process for making  wind energy development 22 
a permitted use w ithin certain parts of the State's unorganized and deorganized areas;  23 
B.  Refining certain procedures of the Department of Environmental Protection and 24 
the Maine Land Use Planning Commission; and  25 
C.  Because the Legislature recognizes that wind turbines ar e potentially a highly 26 
visible feature of the landscape that will have an impact on views, judging the effects 27 
of wind energy development on scenic character and existing uses related to scenic 28 
character based on whether the development significantly compr omises views from a 29 
scenic resource of state or national significance such that the development has an 30 
unreasonable adverse effect on the scenic character or existing uses related to the 31 
scenic character of that resource.  32 
The Legislature further finds that , while wind energy may be developed at many sites 33 
with minimal site -specific environmental impacts, wind energy developments may have, 34 
in addition to their beneficial environmental effects and potential scenic impacts, specific 35 
adverse environmental and l ocal community  effects that must be addressed in state 36 
permitting  regulatory  decisions pursuant to approval criteria tailored to address issues 37 
presented by wind energy development.  Nothing in this section is meant to diminish the 38 
importance of addressing , as appropriate , site-specific impacts on persons, property and  39 
natural values, including, but not limited to, wildlife, wildlife habitats and other 40 
ecological values.  41 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1175(01) -1 
 The Legislature further finds that development of the State's wind energy resources 1 
should be undertaken in a manner that ensures consideration of, and participation by, 2 
persons within communities where wind energy facilities are proposed and  that ensures 3 
significant tangible benefits to the people of the State, including, but not limited to , 4 
residents of communities that host wind energy facilities ;, and that the State should seek 5 
to host a substantial amount of wind energy as part of a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas 6 
emissions and meet the goals established in the state climate action pla n developed 7 
pursuant to Title 38, section 577.  8 
Sec. A -3.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§3, ¶B, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, 9 
§7 and amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended to read:  10 
B.  Specific  Specified  places within the State's  unorganized an d deorganized areas , as 11 
defined by Title 12, section 682, subsection 1,  that are identified by rule by the Maine 12 
Land Use Planning Commission in accordance with this chapter.  13 
Sec. A -4.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§8, ¶B, as amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §26, 14 
is further amended to read:  15 
B.  The Maine Land Use Planning Commission, in the case of a community -based 16 
offshore wind energy project as defined in Title 12, section 682, subsection 19 and a 17 
wind energy development in the unorganized and deorganized areas as de fined in 18 
Title 12, section 682, subsection 1  that is not grid -scale wind energy development.  19 
Sec. A -5.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§8-B is enacted to read:  20 
8-B.  Provisional expedited permitting area.   "Provisional expedited permitting 21 
area" means specified plac es within the unorganized and deorganized areas that are 22 
identified by rule by the Maine Land Use Planning Commission.  23 
Sec. A -6.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§9-A is enacted to read:  24 
9-A.  Specified place.   "Specified place" means the entirety or a portion of a 25 
township or plantation in the unorganized and deorganized areas.  26 
Sec. A -7.  35-A MRSA §3451, sub -§10-A is enacted to read:  27 
10-A.  Unorganized and deorganized areas.   "Unorganized and deorganized areas" 28 
has the same meaning as in Title 12, section 682, subse ction 1.  29 
Sec. A -8.  35-A MRSA §3453, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7 and 30 
amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended to read:  31 
§3453.  Additions to the expedited permitting area  32 
The Maine Land Use Planning Commission may, by rule adopted in  accordance with 33 
Title 5, chapter 375, add a specified place in the State's  unorganized or and deorganized 34 
areas , including specified places within the provisional expedited permitting area,  to the 35 
expedited permitting area.  In order to add a specified pl ace to the expedited permitting 36 
area, the Maine Land Use Planning Commission must determine that the proposed 37 
addition to the expedited permitting area:  38 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR1175(01) -1 
 1.  Geographic extension.  Involves a logical geographic extension of the currently 1 
designated expedite d permitting area , except that the addition of a specified place from 2 
the provisional expedited permitting area does not require that it involve a logical 3 
geographic extension of the expedited permitting area ; 4 
2.  Meets state goals.  Is important to meetin g the state goals for wind energy 5 
development established in section 3404; and  6 
3.  Principal values and goals.  Would not compromise the principal values and the 7 
goals identified in  be consistent with  the comprehensive land use plan adopted by the 8 
Maine La nd Use Planning Commission pursuant to Title 12, section 685 -C and would be 9 
consistent with statutory purpose and scope pursuant to Title 12, section 681 .  10 
The addition of a specified place within the provisional expedited permitting area to 11 
the expedited permitting area constitutes its removal from the provisional expedited 12 
permitting area.  13 
If the Maine Land Use Planning Commission receives written requests from 5 or 14 
more persons requesting a public hearing be held in relation to a petition to add a 15 
specif ied place to the expedited permitting area, a public hearing must be held.  16 
Rules adopted by the Maine Land Use Planning Commission pursuant to this section 17 
are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 18 
PART B  19

SUMMARY  4 
This bill amends legislative findings of the Maine Wind Energy Act, adding emphasis 5 
to public consid eration and participation in decisions related to expedited wind energy 6 
development siting. It directs the Maine Land Use Planning Commission, through 7 
rulemaking, to create a provisional expedited permitting area comprised of unorganized 8 
and deorganized ar eas of the State, which were previously included in the expedited 9 
permitting area, with specific exceptions to recognize existing expedited wind energy 10 
developments. It amends the statutory criteria for adding specified places to the expedited 11 
permitting a rea and adds a requirement that a petition to add a specified place to the 12 
expedited permitting area must involve a public hearing if written requests for a public 13 
hearing are received from 5 or more persons.  14
