that operation of these technical components of the exchange are self -sustaining under 18 
Section 1311(d)(5) of the federal  Affordable Care Act.  19

Affordable Care Act.  25 
3.  Operation of certain exchange fun ctions.  A state agency or department may 26 
operate any exchange function consistent with this section to enable the continuation of 27 
traditional areas of state regulation and authority.  Under Section 1311(d)(4)(A), (D), (F) 28 
and (K) of the federal Affordable  Care Act, a state agency may perform plan management 29

facilitated exchange for the State and to perform any exchange functions necessary to 22 
ensure that State residents have continued eligibility for premium tax cred its and cost - 23

with all applicable health insurance laws of this State and rules adopted and orders issued 28 
by the superintendent.  29 
The provisions of this bill take effect only if the Federal Government notifies the 30 
State that premium t ax credits will become unavailable to people purchasing health 31 
insurance through the federally facilitated marketplace.  32
