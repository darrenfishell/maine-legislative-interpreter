This amendment removes the General Fund appropriations of $90,483 and $92,340 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-
17, respectively, that were in the committee amendment. It requires $300,000 to be transferred annually from 
Efficiency Maine Trust's (EMT) conservation program fund for electric efficiency and conservation programs to the 
Maine Energy Office (MEO). EMT has indicated that this fund has sufficient resources to absorb this annual transfer. 
The committee amendment had limited these transfers to a total of $300,000 over time. The amendment adds Other 
Special Revenue Funds allocations to the MEO of $232, 13 8 and $207,660 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, 
respectively, to fund certain activities related to energy resources, planning and development. The amendment also 
adds Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of$67,862 and $92,340 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, 
respectively, to establish a deputy commissioner position within the MEO. The amendment removes the emergency 
preamble and clause from the bill and this fiscal note assumes that the bill will become law on October 1, 2015.
