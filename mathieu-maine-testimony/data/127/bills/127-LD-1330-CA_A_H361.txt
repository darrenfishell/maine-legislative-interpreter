SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the time frame in which a primary care provider of a child 
is deemed to be unavailable for employment for the purposes of the laws governing the 
collection of child support obligations from 3 years to the first 24 months of the child's 
life. The bill proposes changing it to the first 6 months.

6 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "/+,, to H.P. 905, L.D. 1330 
This amendment also removes the requirement that the Department of Health and 
Human Services include blank forms for modification along with the notice that the child 
support obligation is suspended while the obligor is receiving public assistance. These 
forms are available online, and upon request, and are used by very few recipients of the 
notice. Elimination of this requirement will save close to $3,000 per year in printing and 
mailing costs to the department.
