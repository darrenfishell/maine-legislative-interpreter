SUMMARY  8 
This bill allows a modified utility vehicle, commonly known as a utility vehicle, 9 
recreational utility vehicle o r multipurpose utility vehicle, to be registered and operated 10 
on a public way in Maine with certain limitations.  11 
A modified utility vehicle that meets specified equipment requirements may be 12 
operated on Maine roads with a posted speed limit of 45 miles per  hour or less to go from 13 
an all -terrain vehicle trail to a gasoline station or an establishment selling prepared food 14 
and return to the all -terrain vehicle trail.  Like a low -speed vehicle, a modified utility 15 
vehicle is exempt from inspection requirements and is registered by application to the 16 
Secretary of State, which application must be accompanied by proof of ownership, proof 17 
of insurance and proof of payment of excise tax.  18 
In order to avoid the cost of printing a new registration plate specifically for  modified 19 
utility vehicles, a modified utility vehicle is issued a motorcycle registration plate.  20
