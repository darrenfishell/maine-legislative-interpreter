This amendment removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause from the bill and adjusts the total funding to 
$10,000,000 for the services provided under Section 29: Home and Community Benefits for Members with 
Intellectual Disabilities or Autistic Disorder. In accord with a later start date, this amendment removes the General 
Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of $412,856 in fiscal year 2015-16. 
Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations in fiscal year 2015-16 are also removed. To 
adjust total funding for Section 29 services, this amendment also reduces the General Fund appropriation to DHHS by 
$1,746,713 in fiscal year 2016-17. Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations in fiscal 
year 2016-17 are also reduced. Furthermore, this amendment reduces the General Fund appropriation by $4,807,600 
for the removal of the funding for the services provided under Section 21: Home and Community Benefits for 
Members with Intellectual Disabilities or Autistic Disorder. Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocations in fiscal year 2016-17 are also reduced for the removal of Section 21 services funding. Finally, this 
amendment reduces the General Fund appropriation to Medical Care -Payments to Providers by $3,004,750 in fiscal 
year 2016-17 as a result of the ability to use increased funding available in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage 
in fiscal year 2016-17. As amended, the bill has no net General Fund cost in the 2016-2017 biennium.
