9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 139, L.D. 181, Bill, "An Act To Create 
10 Efficiencies in Court Process" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 4 MRSA ยง8-C is enacted to read: 
14 ยง8-C. Rules concerning electronic records and filing 
15 1. Rules and orders; processes and procedures. Notwithstanding any other 
16 provision of law, the Supreme Judicial Court may adopt rules and issue orders to pennit 
17 or require the use of electronic forms, filings, records, e-mail and electronic signatures 
18 whenever paper forms, filings, records, written notice, postal mail and written signatures 
19 are required for judicial, legal or any other court-related process under the Maine Revised 
20 Statutes. 
21 The Supreme Judicial Court, by rule, may determine any other processes or procedures 
22 appropriate to ensure adequate preservation, disposition, integrity, security, appropriate 
23 accessibility and confidentiality of the electronic records. 
24 2. Electronic signatures. An electronic signature may be accepted as a substitute 
25 for and, if accepted, has the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature. The 
26 Supreme Judicial Court shall determine the type of electronic signature required, the 
27 manner and format in which the signature is affixed to the electronic record and the 
28 criteria that must be met by a party, including attorneys, filing a document.' 
29 SUMMARY 
30 This amendment replaces the bill but retains the provision of the bill that provides the 
31 Supreme Judicial Court the authority to adopt rules governing the use of electronic forms 
32 and filing processes. This amendment authorizes the judicial branch to accept electronic 
33 signatures, which is already authorized for executive branch agencies under the Maine 
34 Digital Signature Act.
