SUMMARY  7 
This bill,  which is based on Montana law, allows the caretaker relative, including a 8 
grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother, sister and cousin, of a minor voluntarily left by the 9 
minor's parent with the caretaker relative to exercise limited authority to make medical 10 
and educational decisions for the minor in place of the parent.  It provides for 11 
authorization of the caretaker relative by a notarized affidavit and sets out the content and 12 
form of the affidavit.  It provides immunity from criminal and civil liability and 13 
professional discipline for persons, including health care providers and school officials, 14 
relying on the affidavit in the absence of the person's knowing facts contrary to the 15 
affidavit or knowing that the parent has made a decision that supersedes the car etaker 16 
relative's decision.  17
