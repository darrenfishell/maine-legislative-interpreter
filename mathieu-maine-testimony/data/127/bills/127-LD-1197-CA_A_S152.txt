10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment provides examples of charitable 
12 or civic purposes within the definition of "incorporated civic organization." Like the bill, 
13 the amendment provides that manufacturers and wholesalers may donate malt liquor, 
14 wine or spirits to be used as prizes or for auctions to public broadcasting stations, 
15 incorporated civic organizations and national organizations with similar purposes to an 
16 incorporated civic organization that are 50 I (c )(3) organizations. Unlike the bill, the 
17 amendment provides that these donations may be made without having to provide the 
18 donation in the form of a gift card good for the purchase of the alcoholic beverage. The 
19 amendment also changes current law by stating that donations may be made to a person 
20 who is licensed to serve alcohol for on-premises consumption when the alcohol is being 
21 served at an event to benefit an incorporated civic organization in the State or a similarly 
22 purposed national 501(0)(3) organization. Current law allows for those donations only to 
23 a public broadcasting station or an incorporated civic organization in the State. 
24 The amendment also provides that a manufacturer or wholesaler licensed by the 
25 Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages 
26 and Lottery Operations to conduct a special taste-testing event may donate its own 
27 product to be served at the event. 
28 Finally the amendment provides that when a manufacturer or wholesaler licensed by 
29 the bureau provides product to be served at an event for a licensed incorporated civic 
30 organization where alcohol will be consumed on the premises, the manufacturer or 
31 wholesaler may serve the product that the manufacturer or wholesaler provided for the 
32 event.
