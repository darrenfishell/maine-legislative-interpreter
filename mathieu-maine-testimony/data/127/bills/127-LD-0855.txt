 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  17 MRSA §3204, sub -§2, ¶¶GG and HH, as enacted by PL 2003, c. 2 
452, Pt. I, §55 and affected by Pt. X, §2, are amended to read:  3 
GG.    Stores that have no more than 5,000 square feet of i nterior customer selling 4 
space, excluding back room storage, office and processing space; and 5 
HH.    Stores with more than 5,000 square feet of interior customer selling space that 6 
engage in retail sales and that do not require, as a condition of employmen t, that their 7 
employees work on Sundays.  If an employer decreases the average weekly work 8 
hours of an employee who has declined to work on Sundays, it is prima facie 9 
evidence that the employer has required Sunday work as a condition of employment 10 
in viola tion of this section, unless the employer and employee agreed that the 11 
employee would work on Sundays when the employee was initially hired.  In no 12 
event, however, may any store having more than 5,000 square feet of interior 13 
customer selling space be open on Easter Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas 14 
Day.; and  15 
Sec. 2.  17 MRSA §3204, sub -§2, ¶II is enacted to read:  16 
II.  Grocery stores that have no more than 10,000 square feet of interior customer 17 
selling space, excluding back room storage, office and proces sing space.  18 
SUMMARY  19 
This bill exempts grocery stores that have no more than 10,000 square feet of interior 20 
customer selling space, excluding back room storage, office and processing space, from 21 
the law prohibiting a place of business from being open on Sun days.  22
