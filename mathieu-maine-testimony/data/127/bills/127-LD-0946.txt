2.  Funding level.   The natural gas conservation fund, which is a nonlapsing fund, is 4 
established to carry out the purposes of this section.  The commission shall assess each 5 
gas utility, in accordance with the triennial plan, an amount necessary to capture all cost - 6 
effective energy efficiency that is achievable and reliable for consumers who  are eligible 7 
to receive funds from the natural gas conservation fund .  All amounts collected under this 8 
subsection must be transferred to the natural gas conservation fund.  Any interest on 9 
funds in the fund must be credited to the fund.  Funds not spent in any fiscal year remain 10 
in the fund to be used for the purposes of this section.  11 
The assessments charged to gas utilities under this section are just and reasonable costs 12 
for rate -making purposes and must be reflected in the rates of gas utilities.  Only  those 13 
consumers whose rates reflect an assessment charged to a gas utility under this section are 14 
eligible for funding from the natural gas conservation fund.  A large volume commercial 15 
or industrial customer, as defined by the commission by rule, may not  be assessed under 16 
this subsection, except through a voluntary arrangement with the commission and the gas 17 
utility that serves that large volume commercial or industrial customer.  18 
All funds collected pursuant to this section are collected under the authori ty and for the 19 
purposes of this section and are deemed to be held in trust for the purposes of benefiting 20 
natural gas consumers served by the gas utilities assessed under this subsection. In the 21 
event funds are not expended or contracted for expenditure wi thin 2 years of being 22 
collected from consumers, the commission shall ensure that the value of those funds is 23 
returned to consumers.  24 
Rules adopted by the commission under this subsection are routine technical rules as 25 
defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subcha pter 2 -A. 26 
Sec. 2.  PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. A, §6, 3rd ¶ from the end, as amended by PL 27 
2013, c. 369, Pt. H, §1 and c. 378, §5, is further amended to read:  28 
The commission may not approve any long -term contract under this section that 29 
would result in an increas e in electric rates in any customer class that is greater than 30 
$1.45 per megawatt hour and may not approve any contract that assesses any amount 31 
from transmission voltage level customers and subtransmission voltage level customers 32 
under this section.  As u sed in this section, "transmission voltage level" and 33 
"subtransmission voltage level" have the same meaning as in Title 35 -A, section 10110, 34 
subsection 6 . 35
