this chapter.  The triennial plan must include provisions for the application of appropriate 16 
program funds to support workforce development efforts that are consistent with and 17 
promote the purposes of the trust.  Beginning January 1, 2011, the triennial  plan must 18 
specify the appropriate participation of the State in national and regional carbon markets.  19 
The plan must be consistent with the comprehensive state energy plan pursuant to Title 2,  20 
section 9 10205 , subsection 3, paragraph C  2. 21 
A.  The triennia l plan must be developed by the trust, in consultation with entities and 22 
agencies engaged in delivering efficiency programs in the State, to authorize and 23 
govern or coordinate implementation of energy efficiency and weatherization 24 
programs in the State.  T he triennial plan must identify all achievable cost -effective 25 
energy efficiency savings and related programs that could be implemented pursuant 26 
to sections 10110 and 10111, the costs and benefits of such programs and the basis 27 
and support for such identifi ed costs and benefits. The trust shall conduct an 28 
evaluation of all cost -effective potential for electrical and natural gas energy 29 
efficiency savings in the State at least once every 5 years.  30 
(1)  Transmission and distribution utilities and natural gas uti lities shall furnish 31 
data to the trust that the trust requests under this subsection to develop and 32 
implement the triennial plan or conduct the evaluation of all cost -effective 33 
potential for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency savings subject to s uch 34 
confidential treatment as a utility may request and the board determines 35 
appropriate pursuant to section 10106.  The costs of providing the data are 36 
deemed reasonable and prudent expenses of the utilities and are recoverable in 37 
rates.  38

 Page 3 - 127LR0207(01) -1 
 C.  The board shall review and approve the triennial plan by affirmative vote of 2/3 of 1 
the trustees upon a finding that the plan is consistent with the statutory authority for 2 
each source of funds that will be used to implement the plan, advances the state 3 
energy efficiency targets in paragraph F and reflects the b est practices of program 4 
administration under subsection 2. The plan must include, but is not limited to, 5 
efficiency and conservation program budget allocations, objectives, targets, measures 6 
of performance, program designs, program implementation strategi es, timelines and 7 
other relevant information.  8 
D.  Prior to submission of the triennial plan to the commission, the trust shall offer to 9 
provide a detailed briefing on the draft plan to the joint standing committee of the 10 
Legislature having jurisdiction ove r energy matters and, at the request of the 11 
committee, shall provide such a briefing and opportunity for input from the 12 
committee.  After providing such opportunity for input and making any changes as a 13 
result of any input received, the board shall deliver  the plan to the commission for its 14 
review and approval.  The commission shall open an adjudicatory proceeding and 15 
issue an order either approving the plan and issuing the appropriate orders to 16 
transmission and distribution utilities and gas utilities or r ejecting the plan and stating 17 
the reasons for the rejection.  The commission shall reject elements of the plan that 18 
propose to use funds generated pursuant to sections 3210 -C, 10110, 10111 or 10119 19 
if the plan fails to reasonably explain how these elements  of the program would 20 
achieve the objectives and implementation requirements of the programs established 21 
under those sections or the measures of performance under subsection 3.  Funds 22 
generated under these statutory authorities may not be used pursuant to the triennial 23 
plan unless those elements of the plan proposing to use the funds have been approved 24 
by the commission.  The commission shall approve all elements of the triennial plan 25 
it determines to be cost -effective, reliable and achievable and shall inc orporate into 26 
gas utility and transmission and distribution rates sufficient revenue to provide for the 27 
procurement of energy efficiency resources identified within the plan pursuant to 28 
section 10110, subsection 4 -A and section 10111, subsection 2. The com mission shall 29 
approve or reject the entire plan or elements of the plan within 120 days of its 30 
delivery to the commission.  The board, within 30 days of final commission approval 31 
of its plan, shall submit the plan to the joint standing committee of the Leg islature 32 
having jurisdiction over energy matters together with any explanatory or other 33 
supporting material as the committee may request and, at the request of the 34 
committee, shall provide a detailed briefing on the final plan.  After receipt of the 35 
plan, the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 36 
matters may submit legislation relating to the plan.  37 
E.  The trust shall determine the period to be covered by the triennial plan except that 38 
the period of the plan may not int erfere with the delivery of any existing contracts to 39 
provide energy efficiency services that were previously procured pursuant to 40 
efficiency and conservation programs administered by the commission.  41 
F.  It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 42 
energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 43 
consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 44 
and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advan ce the following goals, and 45 
funding necessary to meet those goals:  46 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR0207(01) -1 
 (1)  Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;  1 
(2) Weatherizing substantially all homes whose owners or occupants are willing 2 
to participate in and share the costs of cost -effective home weatherization to a 3 
minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030;  4 
(3) Reducing peak -load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 5 
megawatts by 2020;  6 
(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas prog ram savings of at least 7 
20% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 8 
pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 9 
section 10120;  10 
(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 11 
efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and  12 
(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 13 
in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals established in Title 38, 14 
section 576.  15 
The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 16 
emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 17 
program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 18 
may not constitute  a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 19 
generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market.  20 
Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 21 
trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 22 
as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 23 
low-income weatherization programs.  24 
As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene  or 25 
#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing 26 
processes.  27 
Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub -§4-A, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. A, 28 
§20 and affected by §30, is amended to read:  29 
4-A.  Procurement of cost -effective energy efficiency resources.   The commission 30 
shall ensure that transmission and distribution utilities on behalf of their ratepayers 31 
procure all electric energy efficiency resources found by the commission to be cost - 32 
effective, reliable and achievable purs uant to section 10104, subsection 4, except that the 33 
commission may not require the inclusion in rates under this subsection of a total amount 34 
that exceeds 4% of the total retail electricity supply and  transmission and distribution 35 
sales in the State as de termined by the commission by rule.  The cost of procurement of 36 
cost-effective electric energy efficiency resources is a just and reasonable element of 37 
rates.  The commission may issue any appropriate orders to transmission and distribution 38 
utilities neces sary to achieve the goals of this subsection.  When determining the amount 39 
of cost -effective electric energy efficiency resources to be procured under this subsection, 40 
the commission shall:  41 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0207(01) -1 
 A.  Consider electric energy efficiency resources that are reasona bly foreseeable to be 1 
acquired by the trust using all other sources of revenue, including, but not limited to, 2 
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 10109;  3 
B.  Ensure that calculations of avoided energy costs and the budget identi fied by the 4 
trust in its triennial plan as needed to capture all cost -effective electric energy 5 
efficiency resources are reasonable, based on sound evidence and make use of best 6 
practices across the region; and  7 
C.  Maximize total electricity savings for al l ratepayers.  8 
The commission shall consider gross efficiency savings for the purpose of determining 9 
savings that are cost -effective, reliable and achievable and shall consider both net and 10 
gross efficiency savings for the purpose of determining the appropr iateness of the amount 11 
identified by the trust in its triennial plan as needed to capture all cost -effective electric 12 
energy efficiency resources.  13 
Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules under Title 5, chapter 375, 14 
subchapter 2 -A. 15
