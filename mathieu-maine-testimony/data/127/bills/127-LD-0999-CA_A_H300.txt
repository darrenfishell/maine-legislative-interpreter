The general operating expenses of this stUdy are projected to be $4,250 in fiscal year 2015-16. The Legislature's 
proposed budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 for legislative studies. Whether this amount is sufficient to

budgeted staff resources. If more than 4 meetings are held during the interim the estimated cost for each additional 
meeting is projected to be $1,000 for legislative per diem and expenses.

expected to be minor and can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted resources.
