 SUMMARY  1 
This initia ted bill requires a background check before a firearm sale or transfer 2 
between individuals not licensed as firearm dealers. If neither party to a sale or transfer 3 
has a federal firearms license, the parties meet at a licensed firearm dealer, who conducts 4 
a background check on the transferee and completes the sale or transfer as though selling 5 
or transferring from the dealer's own inventory. Exceptions to the background check 6 
requirement are made for transfers between family members, while the parties are 7 
hunting or sport shooting, for emergency self -defense, in the presence of the transferor 8 
and in other circumstances.  9
