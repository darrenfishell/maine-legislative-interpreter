127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 1154, L.D. 1689, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Children in the State from Possible Sexual, Physical and Emotional Abuse by 
Persons Who Have Been Convicted of Crimes" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the safety of children cared for and supervised by child care providers in 
this State is of the utmost importance; and 
Whereas, child care facilities and family child care providers, as well as the families 
who rely on them, need to know that the providers of care and staff members do not have 
disqualifying criminal records from other states; and 
Whereas, the 2014 reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Fund 
program through the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 has 
identified that best practices for background checks include fingerprint-based national 
criminal background checks for all child care providers who supervise children and all 
persons who have unsupervised access to children who are cared for or supervised by a 
child care provider; and 
Whereas, the transition to the criminal background check process required by 
federal law raises significant questions, not the least of which are the employment needs 
of child care providers while waiting for background check results and the costs involved 
in the more rigorous criminal background checks than the checks currently required under 
state law; and 
Whereas, it is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that the additional criminal 
background check process will be cost-effective and will not create an undue burden on 
parents or child care providers; and
