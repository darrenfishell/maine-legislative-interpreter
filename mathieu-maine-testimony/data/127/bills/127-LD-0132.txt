SUMMARY  2 
This bill removes the 100 -megawatt maximum capacity limit for a hydroelectric 3 
generator that meets all state and federal fish passage requirements applicable to 4 
generators to qualify as a renewable  capacity resource and for a hydroelectric generator to 5 
qualify as a renewable resource for the purpose of meeting the State's renewable resource 6 
portfolio requirement.  7
