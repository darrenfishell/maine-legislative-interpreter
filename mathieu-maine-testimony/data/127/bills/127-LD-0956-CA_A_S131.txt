This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $150,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the General Purpose Aid for 
Local Schools program for 3 community schools to be part of a 5-year pilot project to be administered by the 
Department of Education. 
This legislation provides that the department may employ a state community school coordinator to implement the pilot 
project. However, the department is uncertain as to whether or not additional staff will be needed for this purpose. If 
the need for additional resources becomes evident, the department will submit a budget request.
