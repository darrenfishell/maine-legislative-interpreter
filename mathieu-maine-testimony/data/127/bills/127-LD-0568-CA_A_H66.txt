FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 392, L.D. 568, Bill, "An Act To 
Protect Maine Lakes" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 38 MRSA ยง418-B is enacted to read: 
ยง418-B. Prohibition on application of fertilizers near great ponds 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person may not apply a fertilizer 
containing phosphorus or nitrogen within 25 feet of the normal high-water line of a great 
pond, except that a person may apply a fertilizer containing phosphorus or nitrogen 
within 25 feet but not closer than 10 feet of the normal high-water line of a great pond if 
applying the fertilizer using a drop spreader, rotary spreader with a deflector or targeted 
spray liquid. As used in this section, "fertilizer" has the same meaning as in section 419, 
subsection 1, paragraph A-3.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and creates a prohibition on the application of 
fertilizers containing phosphorus or nitrogen within 25 feet of the normal high-water line 
of a great pond, except that a person may apply a fertilizer within 25 feet but not closer 
than 10 feet of the normal high-water line of a great pond using a drop spreader, rotary 
spreader with a deflector or targeted spray liquid.
