Current biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will require additional positions for laboratory inspecting, 
licensing and certifying of marijuana testing facilities and funding for enhancements to the Automated Licensing 
Management System for a new license type. This will increase costs to the DHHS but sufficient information is not 
currently available to assess the actual impact. The DHHS does have the ability to impose licensing fees and the fiscal 
note assumes the fees generated will be sufficient to cover these new costs without additional appropriation from the 
General Fund.
