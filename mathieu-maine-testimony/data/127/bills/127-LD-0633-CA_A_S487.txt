health coverage under Title 22, section 3174-G, subsection 1, paragraph H and may 
request further review by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability. If the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
over government oversight matters makes a request to the Office of Program Evaluation 
and Government Accountability, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability shall conduct an independent, objective review of the report provided by 
the fiscal office and of the information provided to the fiscal office by state agencies. 
The Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability may request 
additional information from any state agencies as appropriate to evaluate the 
effectiveness of providing health coverage under Title 22, section 3174-G, subsection 1, 
paragraph H. In its review, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability shall take into consideration revenues generated as a result of providing 
health coverage under Title 22, section 3174-G, subsection 1, paragraph H, savings to 
state-funded programs including Maine's criminal justice programs, savings to the 
counties from health care costs associated with the operation of the county jails and 
regional jails, savings in reimbursement to cities and towns for general assistance 
provided under Title 22, chapter 1161 and other factors including: the effectiveness of 
coverage in reducing uncompensated care provided by hospitals and federally qualified 
health centers; the reduction in the State's rate of uninsured persons; and increased access 
to preventive care and treatment services that help to reduce cancer risks and chronic 
disease, substance use disorder and mental health disorders, obesity and heart disease. If 
the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability conducts a review 
pursuant to this section, the report must be completed by June 30, 2018.

line and up to 138% of the federal poverty line would receive coverage through private 
health insurance plans, through premium assistance at the same level that would be 
provided through advanced premium tax credits. Individuals within this group defined as 
"medically frail" in accordance with 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 440.315(f) 
are exempt from mandatory enrollment in a private individual or group qualified health 
plan. 
The amendment requires MaineCare members with incomes over 100% and equal to 
or below 138% of the federal poverty line who are receiving private health coverage 
through a private individual or group qualified health plan to pay premiums and cost 
sharing up to a maximum of 5% of the household's income. The amendment provides for 
termination of coverage for nonpayment of premium without good cause. Good cause 
must be defined by rules adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The amendment authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to contract 
with health insurance plans to provide coverage in order to maximize savings and to 
ensure access to and quality of services. 
The amendment repeals the expanded coverage if the enhanced federal medical 
assistance percentage is reduced below that specified in the federal law or if expanded 
coverage is not reauthorized by the Legislature by June 30, 2019. 
The amendment requires the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare 
and submit to the Federal Government any state plan amendments and federal waivers by 
January 1, 2017 necessary to implement the program. 
The amendment authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to apply 
for and accept private foundation grants to b1~ used to cover the cost of preparing and 
submitting any waivers and state plan amendments to the Federal Government required as 
a result of expanding coverage. It requires the department to develop mechanisms to 
create a seamless system for determining eligibility for the MaineCare program and for 
premium assistance for those who are already enrolled in a group or individual qualified 
health plan, using the federally facilitated marketplace to determine eligibility for the 
MaineCare program and for individuals in a private individual or group qualified health 
plan if it is determined to be more efficient. The amendment also requires the 
department, after consultation with a stakeholder group, to file a waiver to test a full 
continuum of substance use disorder treatment that will, among other things, authorize 
Medicaid coverage for services provided in inpatient and short-term residential facilities. 
The amendment requires monthly reporting to the committees of jurisdiction on the 
status of waiver submission until the disposition of such a waiver is determined, and on 
the status of implementation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 3174-G, 
subsection 1, paragraph H no later than June 1, 2017 and by April 30, 2017, April 30, 
2018 and April 30, 2019 on savings generated for state-funded programs as a result of 
implementation. It requires the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Maine Revenue Services to report by April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018 on revenues 
generated as a result of expanded coverage. It requires that savings and revenues be 
verified by the Office of Fiscal and Program Review by May 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018. 
It transfers any savings to the MaineCare Stabilization Fund prior to the next fiscal year. 
It requires the Office of Fiscal and Program Review to report its findings to the joint

Part A of this bill expands medical coverage under the MaineCare program to adults who qualify under federal law 
with incomes up to 133% of the nonfarm income official poverty line (FPL), with the 5% federal income adjustment 
for family size. Individuals with income equal to or below 100% FPL would receive coverage through MaineCare. 
Individuals with income over 100% FPL through 138% FPL would receive coverage through private health insurance 
plans, through premium assistance at the same level that would be provided through advanced premium tax credits. 
Part A also requires those with income over 100% and equal to or below 138% FPL who are receiving private health 
coverage through the Maine Private Health Insurance Protection Program to pay premiums and cost sharing up to a 
maximum of 5% of household income. Part A also allows for the tennination of the program under two scenarios: 1) If 
the federal share for individuals eligible under this paragraph is reduced below the amounts specified in 42 United 
States Code, Section 1396d(y)(l) or 2) if expanded coverage is not reauthorized by the legislature by June 30, 2019. 
The Department of Health and Human services (DHHS), after consultation with a stakeholder group, is required to file 
a waiver to test a full continuum of substance use disorder treatment. This part also authorizes the DHHS to apply for 
and accept private foundation grants to be used to cover the cost of preparing and submitting any waivers and state 
plan amendments to the federal government required as a result of expanding coverage. The DHHS will report monthly 
on the status of the waiver and will report no later than June 1, 2017 on the status of implementation of the program. 
LRl 188(02) -Fiscal Note: -Page 1 of 3 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $1,933,957 in fiscal year 2016-2017 to the Office ofFamily 
Independence -District program in the DHHS for the State share of the costs of 103 new positions to administer the 
eligibility expansion. Funding for the new positions reflects a 75% federal match for the 79 Eligibility Specialist 
positions and a 50% federal match for other new positions. The funding for the Eligibility Specialist positions assumes 
a 700 person caseload for each new position. This is the target caseload the DHHS has identified for the Eligibility 
Specialist positions. Although this bill allows for the DHHS to utilize the federally facilitated marketplace for 
eligibility determinations, this estimate assumes that will not occur in the current or next biennium. 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $4,422,964 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the DHHS for medical costs for 
the newly eligible childless adult population at or below 100% of the federal poverty level and a Federal Expenditures 
Fund allocation of $84,036,307 in fiscal year 2016-17, as shown below. The estimated costs assume 95% enhanced 
federal matching funds through December 31, 2017, 94% enhanced federal matching funds through December 31, 
2018 and 93% enhanced federal matching funds through December 31, 2019 for the childless adult population with 
incomes less than 100% of the federal poverty level.

coinsurance costs for the newly eligible childless adult population from 101 % to 13 8% of FPL on the Private Health

The bill also includes a General Fund appropriation of $20,475,789 in fiscal year 2016-17 for the DHHS for premium 
and coinsurance costs for the parent population from 101 % to 138% of the federal poverty level on the Private Health 
Insurance market, as shown below. The below table assumes 15,455 parents who lost coverage and an additional 4,565 
parents who have not had MaineCare in the past, but will opt for this expansion coverage. Since this group was eligible 
under previous rules, they will not be considered newly eligible and the State will receive the regular Federal Medical 
Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The bill also includes a Federal Expenditures Fund allocation for the parents totaling 
$36,943,699 in fiscal year 2016-17, as shown below, for the regular FMAP matching funds.

for the children who have not had MaineCare in the past, but whose family will opt for MaineCare coverage after 
expansion. Since these children were eligible under previous rules, they will not be considered newly eligible and the 
State will receive the enhanced Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) FMAP. The bill also includes Federal 
Expenditures Fund allocations for children totaling $9,843,135 in fiscal year 2016-17, as shown below, for the

The bill also includes deappropriations for the remaining funding in the MaineCare baseline for the costs of coverage 
for the parents population from 101 % to 138% of the FPL. This group was covered through December 31, 2013, with 
the possibility of transitional coverage extending through December 31, 2014. The DHHS identified, as of May 2014, 
an annual General Fund total in the baseline for spending on this population of$16,936,665. Of this amount, 
$10,000,000 was deappropriated in PL 2013, c. 595 to fund Sections 21 and 29 waitlist members and to increase 
nursing facility reimbursement rates. Since there were no subsequent MaineCare appropriations or deappropriations 
affecting this population during the 126th Legislature or the 1st Regular Session of the 127th Legislature, continued 
funding for this population is included in the 2016-2017 MaineCare biennial budget baseline. This bill deappropriatr 
the remaining $6,936,665 that is in the baseline. 
Part B of the bill includes a General Fund deappropriation of $13,000,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 in the Executive 
Branch Departments and Independent Agencies -Statewide program in the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services for savings to be identified by the State Budget Officer in existing programs as a result of the expansion of 
eligibility. Part B also requires Maine Revenue Services to report by April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018 regarding 
revenues generated as a result of expanded coverage. It requires that savings and revenues be verified by the Office of 
Fiscal and Program Review by March 15, 2017 and May 15, 2018. It also requires the Office of Fiscal and Program 
Review to report its findings to the joint standing c01mnittee having jurisdiction over appropriations and financial 
affairs and to the joint standing committee having jurisdiction over government oversight and authorizes the latter 
committee to request further review and reporting by the Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability on the effectiveness of providing coverage through expanded MaineCare coverage. The specific 
programs and amount of savings that will be realized and distributed to each program cannot by detennined at this 
time. As a benchmark, a review was done of a report on potential savings created by an outside consulting group 
familiar with Medicaid expansions. While that group's overall savings identified appear to be on the high side, the 
review does support a reasonable expectation of greater than $20,000,000 million in savings annually with the full 
implementation of the expansion. 
Additional costs for the Legislature's Office of Fiscal and Program Review can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources. Additional costs for the Legislature's Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability to 
conduct a review can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources but may affect the resources available to perfonn 
other assigned reviews.
