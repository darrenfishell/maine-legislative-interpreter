Fiscal Note 
Minor revenue decrease -General Fund 
Under current law, manufacturers and importing wholesale licensees pay an excise tax of 60 cents per gallon of 
kombucha manufactured in or imported into the State. Any additional revenue loss to the Bureau of Alcoholic 
Beverages and Lottery Operations within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services from having an 
excise tax on kombucha at 35 cents per gallon is expected to be minor.
