 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill would require that, beginning with the 2016 -2017 school year and only after 5 
the adoption of major substan tive rules by the Department of Education, the 6 
Commissioner of Education implement a school assessment system to measure school 7 
performance and student proficiency.  The system implemented must include multiple 8 
measures of student achievement and may inclu de, but is not limited to, the use of:  9 
1.  Summative assessments aligned with the grade level expectations of the 10 
parameters for essential instruction and graduation requirements established under the 11 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20 -A, section 6209, subse ction 2 and Department of 12 
Education Rule Chapter 132: Learning Results: Parameters for Essential Instruction;  13 
2.  Formative assessments that measure student growth over time; and  14 
3.  Information of the state assessment program under Title 20 -A, section 620 4 on 15 
student achievement reported by the department in compliance with applicable federal 16 
statutes and regulations regarding student assessment as required by the federal No Child 17 
Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 United States Code, Chapter 70.  18 
The bill would r equire the commissioner to annually report the statewide and school 19 
level results of the school assessment system with regard to the performance of schools 20 
and the proficiency of students in each of the State's elementary and secondary schools 21 
and to provi de each participating school with a profile of school performance and student 22 
proficiency based upon data from the school assessment system. The reporting 23 
mechanisms and the categories reported must be uniform for each school compared at the 24 
elementary lev el or the secondary level.  25 
The bill would also require the Commissioner of Education to convene a task force to 26 
develop a system to evaluate or rate the performance of public schools in the State and to 27 
incorporate the recommendations of the task force in the adoption of major substantive 28 
rules under this bill. The task force must include, but is not limited to, representatives of 29 
the following entities and stakeholder groups:  30 
1. The Department of Education;  31 
2. The State Board of Education;  32 
3. Teachers;  33 
4. Principals;  34 
5. Parents;  35 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1798(01) -1 
 6. The Education Research Institute under Title 20 -A, section 10; and  1 
7. Students.  2 
The school assessment system developed by the task force must include, but is not 3 
limited to, the following elements:  4 
1. Accurate measures of student  progress over at least 3 years;  5 
2. Rates of postsecondary school attendance and enlistment in the United States 6 
Armed Forces over at least 3 years;  7 
3. A peer group comparison that takes into account, but is not limited to, use of 8 
special education service s, the number of students eligible for free or reduced -price 9 
meals, local and county unemployment data and median household income;  10 
4. School attendance rates;  11 
5. Graduation rates;  12 
6. Procedures to address specific challenges unique to a municipality, coun ty or 13 
school administrative unit; and  14 
7. Interviews with parents of students, members of governing boards of school 15 
administrative units, teachers and other education leaders about the overall school 16 
environment.  17 
The bill would require the task force to re view the requirements of Title 20 -A, 18 
chapter 222 and the school assessment systems that have been implemented in other 19 
states and jurisdictions and develop a school assessment system that will best serve the 20 
academic and developmental needs of students in this State. The school assessment 21 
system may not use a bell curve, and a school may not be penalized because of the failure 22 
of students to take certain standardized tests. The task force would be required to provide 23 
opportunities for the public and interes ted parties to provide input regarding the 24 
development of the school assessment system and give notice to the public and interested 25 
parties of the task force's meetings during which the public may provide testimony or 26 
feedback on the proposed models under consideration by the task force.  27
