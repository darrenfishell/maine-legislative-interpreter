use. The amendment reduces the maximum rate differential that may be applied by a 
carrier for tobacco use in individual and small group health insurance policies from 1.5 to 
1 to 1.2 to 1 and makes the changed rate differential apply to all policies, contracts and 
certificates issued or renewed on or after January 1,2017.
