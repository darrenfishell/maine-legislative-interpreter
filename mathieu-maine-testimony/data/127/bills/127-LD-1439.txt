SUMMARY  18 
This bill establishes an interagency comprehensive background check program to 19 
protect Maine citizens vulnerable to abuse, neglect or exploitation by individuals in 20 
positions of trust who are charged with the physical and financial care of these 21 
individuals. Providers are required to perform background checks prior to hiring new 22 
direct care workers as well as current on direct access personnel.  23 
The bill creates the Background Check Center, which allows direct access care 24 
providers to secure backgr ound information from abuse and neglect databases, sex 25 
offender registries, the registry of certified nursing assistants and direct care workers, 26 
professional licensing authorities, Medicare and Medicaid exclusion databases and 27 
criminal history record repo sitories.  28 
The bill enables the Background Check Center to provide a report that identifies 29 
offenses that disqualify an individual from employment as a direct access worker.  30 
The bill authorizes a system of continued criminal record monitoring through a ra p 31 
back program to ensure that employers are informed of any new disqualifying criminal 32 
offense that may occur after a direct access worker's initial background check.  33 
The bill provides for a conditional employment process that allows direct access 34 
workers to correct inaccurate background check report records and procedures to 35 
gradually implement background checks for current employees.  36 
The bill outlines compliance requirements including penalties and the impact of 37 
violations on provider licensing for noncom pliance with the requirements.  38
