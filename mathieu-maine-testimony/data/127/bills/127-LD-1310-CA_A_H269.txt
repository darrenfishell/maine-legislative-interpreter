9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "11" to H.P. 888, L.D. 1310, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend the Community-based Renewable Energy Program" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3602, sub-§3-A is enacted to read: 
14 3-A. Net generating capacity. "Net generating capacity" means the output of a 
15 generating facility delivered to the transmission and distribution utility system. "Net 
16 generating capacity" does not include any energy consumed by the generator to operate 
17 the electricity generating facility and energy consumed for plant lighting, power and 
18 auxiliaty facilities. 
19 Sec. 2. 35-A MRSA §3603, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 454, §3, is 
20 further amended to read: 
21 2. Program scope; limits on generating capacity. The commission shall limit 
22 participation in the program in accordance with this subsection. 
23 A. The metalled net generating capacity of a program participant may not exceed 10 
24 megawatts. 
25 B. The total metalled net generating capacity of all program participants combined 
26 may not exceed 50 megawatts. 
27 D. Of the 50-megawatt limit on total net generating capacity under paragraph B,.w.2 
28 megawatts must be reserved at the outset of the program for program participants 
29 that: 
30 (1) Have aft metalled a net generating capacity of less than 100 kilowatts; or 
31 (2) Are located in the service territory of a consumer-owned transmission and 
32 distribution utility. 
33 The commission may modify the amount of net generating capacity reserved under 
34 this paragraph based on program experience.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 888, L.D. 1310 
1 E. The total installed net generating capacity of program participants that receive the 
2 renewable energy credit multiplier incentive under section 3605 may not exceed 10 
3 megawatts. 
4 Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3609, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 329, Pt. A, §4, is repealed. 
5 Sec. 4. 35-A MRSA §3610 is enacted to read: 
6 §3610. Project deadline; completion deadline 
7 The commission may not issue an order after December 31. 2015 directing an 
8 investor-owned transmission and distribution utility to enter into a long-term contract 
9 under this chapter nor allow a consumer-owned transmission and distribution utility to 
10 enter into a long-term contract under this chapter. All community-based renewable 
11 energy projects that have been selected for a long-term contract must become operational 
12 and commence generating electricity by December 31, 2018. 
13 Sec. 5. Viability assessment; request for proposals. The Public Utilities 
14 Commission shall review all certified program participant projects under the Maine 
15 Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3603 that have not yet reached commercial 
16 operations to determine whether the projects are reasonably likely to achieve commercial 
17 operations within a 3-year period. For those projects the commission determines will not 
18 be viable within a 3-year period, the commission must revoke any contract awarded, but 
19 the project may still remain certified. To the extent there is less capacity remaining than is 
20 allowed under Title 35-A, section 3603, subsection 2 after the removal of nonviable 
21 projects, the commission shall conduct an expedited request for proposals to select 
22 community-based renewable energy projects to become program participants and enter 
23 into long-term contracts. A project under this process may not elect to choose the 
24 renewable energy credit multiplier incentive under Title 35-A, section 3605, and those 
25 projects that are operational and have elected the renewable energy credit multiplier do 
26 not count towards the 50-megawatt cap on net generating capacity under Title 35-A, 
27 section 3603, subsection 2. The commission shall select the projects that provide the most 
28 benefit to ratepayers and that have contract pricing levels below 10¢ per kilowatt hour 
29 within each contract year. To the maximum extent practicable, the commission must 
30 select projects to provide for a total net generating capacity for all projects to meet the 
31 maximum allowance under Title 35-A, section 3603, subsection 2 of 50 megawatts.' 
32 SU~Y 
33 This amendment is the majority report of the committee and strikes and replaces the 
34 bill. The amendment provides a definition for the term "net generating capacity." The 
35 amendment changes the limits on generating capacity from installed generating capacity 
36 to net generating capacity. The amendment reduces the reserved amount of megawatts 
37 from 10 to 2 for program participants that have a net generating capacity of less than 100 
38 kilowatts or are located in the service territory of a consumer-owned transmission and 
39 distribution utility. The amendment removes the scheduled repeal of the law regulating 
40 community-based renewable energy and clarifies that the Public Utilities Commission 
41 may not issue an order after December 31, 2015 directing an investor-owned transmission 
42 and distribution utility to enter into any long-term contract or allow a consumer-owned 
43 transmission and distribution utility to enter into any long-term contract. The amendment

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMlTTEE AMENDMENf "A "to H.P. 888, L.D. 1310 
1 specifies that all community-based renewable energy projects that have been selected for 
2 a long-tenn contract must become operational and commence generating electricity by 
3 December 31,2018. 
4 The amendment requires the commission to review all certified program participant 
5 projects that have not yet reached commercial operations to determine whether projects 
6 are reasonably likely to achieve commercial operations within a 3-year time period. This 
7 amendment provides that those projects determined not viable remain certified, but any 
8 contract that had been issued is to be revoked. The amendment allows the commission to 
9 conduct an expedited request for proposals to select community-based renewable energy 
10 projects to become program participants and enter into long-tenn contracts, if there is 
11 capacity remaining after the removal of nonviable projects. The amendment specifies 
12 that only those projects that provide the most benefit to ratepayers and have contract 
13 pricing below 10¢ per kilowatt hour within each contract year may be chosen. Lastly, this 
14 amendment prohibits a project under this process from choosing the renewable energy 
15 credit multiplier incentive. Those projects that are operational and have elected the 
16 renewable energy credit multiplier do not count towards the 50-megawatt cap on net 
17 generating capacity.

Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
The bill eliminates the December 31, 2015 repeal date for the Community-based Renewable Energy Act and requires 
the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to review certain certified program participant projects to determine whether 
they are reasonably likely to achieve commercial operations within a 3-year time period. Any additional costs to the, 
PUC are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. .
