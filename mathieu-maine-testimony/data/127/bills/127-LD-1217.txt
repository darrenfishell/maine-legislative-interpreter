a notice suitable for posting by employers in the workplace in forming applicants and 14 
employees of their rights under this subchapter.  The bureau shall update this notice on 15

workplace, job site or other location at which it is posted.  22 
§617.  Requirements governing retention of records  23 
An employer shall retain work schedule and payroll records pertainin g to employees 24 
for 3 years and shall allow the bureau access to the records, with appropriate notice and 25 
during business hours, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subchapter.  26 
The bureau may have access to all places of labor subject to thi s subchapter during 27 
business hours to inspect books and records, interview employees and investigate such 28 
matters necessary or appropriate to determine whether an employer has violated any 29 
provisions of this subchapter.  If an employer does not maintain or  retain adequate 30 
records documenting compliance with this subchapter or does not allow the bureau 31 
reasonable access to the records, it must be presumed that the employer did not comply 32 
with this subchapter, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contr ary. 33 
§618.  Exercise of rights protected; retaliation prohibited  34 
1.  Rights.  An employer or any other person may not interfere with, restrain or deny 35 
the exercise or the attempt to exercise any right protected under this subchapter.  An 36 
employer or any ot her person may not discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend 37 
or otherwise take adverse employment action against any employee in retaliation for 38 
exercising rights protected under this subchapter.  These rights include but are not limited 39 
to: 40 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR0474(01) -1 
 A.  The right to request a modification to the initial proposed work schedule provided 1 
under section 615;  2 
B.  The right to inform any person about an employer's alleged violation of this 3 
subchapter;  4 
C.  The right to file a complaint with the bureau alleging a vi olation of this 5 
subchapter;  6 
D.  The right to cooperate with the bureau or other persons in the investigation or 7 
prosecution of any alleged violation of this subchapter;  8 
E.  The right to oppose any policy, practice or act that is unlawful under this 9 
subchap ter; and  10 
F.  The right to inform any person of the person's rights under this subchapter.  11 
2.  Retaliation.  Taking adverse action against an employee within 90 days of the 12 
employee's exercise of rights protected under this subchapter raises a rebuttable 13 
presumption that the party taking the adverse action did so in retaliation for the exercise 14 
of those rights.  15 
§619.  Investigation and complaints  16 
1.  Investigation.  The bureau may investigate possible violations of this subchapter.  17 
2.  Complaints.  An employ ee or other person may report to the bureau any 18 
suspected violation of this subchapter.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, the 19 
name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation 20 
is confidential except that, with the authorization of the employee or person reporting the 21 
violation, the bureau may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying 22 
information as necessary to enforce this section or for other appropriate purposes.  23 
3.  Bureau discretion.  The bur eau's decision to investigate or pursue a violation of 24 
this subchapter is solely at the bureau's discretion.  The filing of a report of a suspected 25 
violation by an employee does not create any right of appeal to the bureau by the 26 
employee.  27 
§620.  Penalties  28 
1.  Civil violation.  An employer that violates any provision of this subchapter 29 
commits a civil violation for which a fine of not more than $50 per day, for each day or 30 
portion of a day that the violation occurred or continued, may be adjudged.  31 
2.  Civil  action.  The Attorney General may bring an action to enjoin violations of 32 
this subchapter and for any other available remedy, including, but not limited to, the 33 
payment of lost wages and payment of an additional sum as liquidated damages in an 34 
amount not to exceed lost wages, reinstatement and reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  35 
This action and an action to prosecute the civil violation pursuant to subsection 1 may be 36 
joined in the same proceeding.  Notwithstanding Title 14, section 1602 -C, the court sh all 37 
award interest at a rate of 10% per annum on all amounts due and unpaid.  38 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0474(01) -1 
 §620 -A.  No limitation of other rights and remedies  1 
This subchapter does not in any way limit the rights and remedies that the law 2 
otherwise provides to employees, including, but not limited to, the rights to be free from 3 
wrongful termination and unlawful discrimination.  4 
§620 -B.  Rules  5 
The Department of Labor may adopt routine technical rules, as defined in Title 5, 6 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A, to implement the provisions of this s ubchapter.  The rules 7

efficient and cost -effective implementation and enforcement of this subchapter, including 9 
procedures for helping to inform employees of their righ ts under this subchapter and for 10 
monitoring employer compliance.  11

January 1st of every even -numbered year thereafter, the bureau shall provide a written 14 
report regarding this subchapter to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 15

number of violations and the penalties assessed in the prior year, or prior 2 years starting 18 
with the report due by January 1, 2020.  The report may also include recommendations 19 
for possible improvements to this subchapter.  20
