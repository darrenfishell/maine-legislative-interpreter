 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2513, as amended by PL 2011, c. 331, §12 and affected by 2 
§§16 and 17, is further amended to read:  3 
§2513.  Tax on premiums and annuity considerations  4 
Every insurance company or association that does business or collects premiums or 5 
assessments including annuity considerations in the State, including surety companies 6 
and companies engaged in the business of credit insurance or title insurance, shall, for the 7 
privilege of doing bus iness in this State and in addition to any other taxes imposed for 8 
that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct premiums including annuity considerations, 9 
whether in cash or otherwise, on contracts written on risks located or resident in the State 10 
for insurance of life, annuity, fire, casualty and other risks at the rate of 2% a year.  Every 11 
nonadmitted insurer that does business or collects premiums in the State shall, for the 12 
privilege of doing business in this State and in addition to any other taxes imposed for 13 
that privilege, pay a tax upon all gross direct premiums, whether in cash or otherwise, as 14 
provided in section 2531.  For purposes of this section, the term "annuity considerations" 15 
includes amounts paid to an insurance company for the purchase  of a contract that may 16 
result in an annuity, even if the annuitization never occurs or does not occur until some 17 
time in the future and the amounts are in the meantime applied to an investment vehicle 18 
other than an annuity.  This section does not apply to  mutual fire insurance companies 19 
subject to tax under section 2517 or to captive insurance companies formed or licensed 20 
under Title 24 -A, chapter 83 or under the laws of another state.  21 
Notwithstanding this section, annuity considerations received in tax ye ars ending 22 
prior to January 1, 1999 upon which no tax was paid in the year received must be taxed in 23 
the year in which an annuity is actually purchased.  24 
Notwithstanding this section, for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 25 
1989, the tax impo sed by this section upon all gross direct premiums collected or 26 
contracted for on long -term care policies, as certified by the superintendent pursuant to 27 
Title 24 -A, section 5054, must be at the rate of 1% a year.  28 
Notwithstanding this section, for tax year s commencing on or after January 1, 1997, 29 
the tax imposed by this section with respect to premiums on qualified group disability 30 
policies written by every insurer, except a large domestic insurer, must be at the rate of 31 
1% and must be at the rate of 2.55% with respect to those premiums written by every 32 
large domestic insurer.  For the purposes of this section, the term "qualified group 33 
disability policies" is limited to group health insurance policies properly reported as such 34 
in the insurer's annual statem ent and whose sole coverage is the full or partial 35 
replacement of an individual's income in the event of disability.  Policies that contain 36 
coverages in addition to replacement of income coverage are considered to solely provide 37 
that coverage as long as th e premium related to the additional coverages is not more than 38 
10% of the total premium charged.  The term "qualified group disability policies" does 39 
not include workers' compensation insurance policies, policies that include coverages that 40 
are collectivel y renewable, policies that provide for credit disability insurance or policies 41 
that pay benefits only upon the occurrence of hospitalization.  For purposes of this 42

 section, a "large domestic insurer" is any insurer domiciled in this State with assets in 1 
excess of $5,000,000,000 as reported on its annual statement.  2 
Notwithstanding this section, for income tax years commencing in 2016 the tax 3 
imposed by this section upon annuity considerations must be at a rate of 1.5%.  4 
Notwithstanding this section, for incom e tax years commencing in 2017 the tax 5 
imposed by this section upon annuity considerations must be at a rate of 1%.  6 
Notwithstanding this section, for income tax years commencing in 2018 the tax 7 
imposed by this section upon annuity considerations must be at  a rate of 0.5%.  8 
Notwithstanding this section, for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 9 
2019 annuity considerations are exempt from the tax imposed by this section.  10 
SUMMARY  11 
This bill phases out the tax imposed upon annuity considerations.  Th e current tax of 12 
2% is decreased by 0.5% each year beginning in 2016 until it is eliminated beginning 13 
January 1, 2019.  14
