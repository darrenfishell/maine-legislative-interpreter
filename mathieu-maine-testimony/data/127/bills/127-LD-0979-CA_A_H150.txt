This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $132,235 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $143,513 in fiscal year 
2016-17 to the Employment Services Activity program within the Department of Labor for the Bureau of Employment 
Services to conduct a forest products workforce development pilot program. Of this amount, $100,000 per year is 
appropriated to provide funding to employers in the forest products industry who hire high schools graduates or 
holders of general equivalency diplomas who are between 18 and 20 years of age. An additional $32,235 in fiscal 
year 2015-16 and $43,513 in fiscal year 2016-17 is appropriated for one half-time CareerCenter Consultant position 
and related all other costs to administer the pilot program. Because this legislation does not provide an end date for 
the pilot program, this fiscal note assumes that the program will extend at least through the 2018-2019 biennium.
