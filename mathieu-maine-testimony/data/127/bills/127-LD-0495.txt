assessments and language regarding reporting of fees to the State Auditor by clerks of 32 
judicial courts.  It restricts the permanent employment of certain officers in the Offi ce of 33 
the State Auditor, including the State Auditor, to certified public accountants, certified 34 
information systems auditors and certified internal auditors.  It updates references to 35 
public accountants.  It removes language regarding forms prescribed by the Office of the 36 
State Auditor that are to be used by clerks of the Superior Court to record certain fines, 37 
costs and forfeitures and language regarding the auditing of certain bills and accounts of 38 
counties.  It repeals language regarding the State Audit or's establishing a process for 39

 funds and removes language regarding the Office of the State Auditor's receiving by mail 1 
copies of certain notices to municipalities.  It changes language regarding the auditing 2 
standards of municipal postaudits to replace a reference to the State Auditor, who does 3 
not establish auditing standards, with a reference to the United States Government 4 
Accountability Office, which does.  It makes further changes to the law regarding 5 
municipal postaudits to reflect that the Office of the State Auditor is usually not involved 6 
with municipal audits, including audits regarding jail supplies.  It repeals a provision 7 
regarding the State Auditor's reporti ng of the financial matters of municipalities and 8 
quasi -municipal corporations.  It changes the laws governing the Board of Emergency 9 
Municipal Finance to remove language requiring the State Auditor to determine whether 10 
a municipality or unorganized territ ory is unable to provide for its direct relief and work 11 
programs.  12
