SUMMARY  4 
This bill authorizes the Department of Public Safety, Gambling Cont rol Board to 5 
issue 2 casino licenses, one in the southern region of the State, which includes York 6 
County and Cumberland County, and one in the northern region of the State, which 7 
includes Penobscot County, Washington County and Aroostook County.  In order  to be 8 
eligible to apply for a casino license, an applicant must be awarded the privilege to 9 
submit an application pursuant to a competitive bidding process.  The competitive 10 
bidding process is administered by a site location commission established by this  bill.  11 
The Casino Site Location Commission consists of 5 members appointed by the Governor 12 
subject to review by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 13 
over casino gaming and confirmation by the Senate.  The bill provides that commission 14 
members may not have a conflict of interest and are prohibited from representing or being 15 
employed by gambling interests during their term on the commission and for 5 years after 16 
their term ends.  17 
Under the bill, a successful bidder for a casino in the southern region of the State 18 
must propose a capital investment of at least $250,000,000 exclusive of license fees, land 19 
acquisition and off -site improvements.  The initial fee for a southern region casino is 20 
$5,000,000 for a 5 -year license term in a ddition to a $250,000 application fee and 21 
$100,000 investigative fee.  The renewal fee for a southern region casino is $250,000.  22 
A successful bidder for a casino in the northern region of the State must propose a 23 
minimum capital investment of $25,000,000 e xclusive of license fees, land acquisition 24 
and off -site improvements.  The initial fee for a northern region casino is $1,000,000 for a 25 
5-year license term in addition to a $100,000 application fee and a $100,000 investigative 26 
fee.  The renewal fee for a n orthern region casino is $100,000.  27 
The bill provides factors that the commission is directed to consider when reviewing 28 
bids for the privilege to submit an application to operate a casino.  Examples of those 29 
factors include: how the proposal from a bidder will result in the highest potential benefit 30 
to the State based on documented, expert market analyses, the potential of the proposed 31 
facility to serve as a tourism destination and how the proposal will preserve existing jobs 32 
and create new full -time jobs i n the State.  For the casino bid in the northern region, the 33 
commission is directed to consider how the proposal will provide the greatest benefit to 34 
one or all of the federally recognized Indian tribes in the State, particularly by proposing 35 
operation and  ownership by one or more of the tribes.  36 
Finally, the bill authorizes the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal 37 
Affairs to submit a bill establishing a  uniform distribution structure for slot machine and 38 
table game revenue to the Legislature.  39
