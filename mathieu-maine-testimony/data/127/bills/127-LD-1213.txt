SUMMARY  33 
This bill eliminates the deadline f or local approval of the operation of slot machines 34 
or a casino at a commercial track in the State and allows the commercial track greater 35 
latitude in relocating to a municipality that supports the commercial track and harness 36 
racing as long as the commerc ial track does not relocate closer to any existing casino or 37 
slot machine facility.  The bill also requires that gaming operations be located at the 38 
racetrack as part of a fully integrated destination resort and also requires a one -time 39 
competitive bidding  and fair market value license fee to be determined by the 40 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1174(01) -1 
 Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services.  The bill provides that most of 1 
the revenues distributed from the commercial track are credited to the General Fund.  2
