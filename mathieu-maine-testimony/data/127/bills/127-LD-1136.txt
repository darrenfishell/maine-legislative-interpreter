SUMMARY  21 
This is a periodic update of the Maine Business Corporations Act to reflect recently 22 
adopted changes to the Model Business Corporations Act.  23 
This bill extends the existing ability of a co rporation to reduce or eliminate certain 24 
fiduciary duties owed by directors to Maine corporations and their shareholders by means 25 
of provisions in the corporation’s articles of incorporation to situations involving business 26 
opportunities that could be of i nterest to the corporation.  27 
This bill makes minor clarifying changes to existing provisions relating to the 28 
signatures on share certificates, the right of shareholders to call special shareholders’ 29 
meetings and the permitted duration of voting trusts, pros pectively eliminating a 30 
restriction limiting such trusts to 21 years.  31 
This bill clarifies existing provisions relating to the duration of proxies to vote shares 32 
in Maine corporations and the effectiveness of irrevocable proxies.  33 
This bill clarifies and exp ands upon existing provisions relating to inspectors of 34 
elections, including provisions regarding the appointment, roles, duties and procedures of 35 
inspectors and judicial review of their actions and decisions.  36 
This bill contains detailed provisions relatin g to judicial review of disputes 37 
concerning elections and appointments of directors and officers of Maine corporations, 38 
 
 Page 12 - 127LR1373(01) -1 
 including the matters as to which the judiciary may issue rulings, the persons who may 1 
commence such proceedings, the persons who must b e named as defendants in such 2 
proceedings, service of process and the scope and types of remedies that may be granted 3 
in such actions.  4 
This bill clarifies when and in what manner qualifications for service as a director of 5 
a Maine corporation, or to be nom inated as such, may become applicable relative to the 6 
time of nomination or time of election or during such person's tenure as a director.  7 
This bill provides that Maine’s existing statutory provision allowing judicially 8 
mandated dissolution of a Maine corp oration in cases involving "oppression" of one or 9 
more shareholders is applicable to corporations whose securities are publicly traded.  10
