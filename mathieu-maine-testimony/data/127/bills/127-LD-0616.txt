 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA ยง1355 -A, sub -ยง4, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 629, ยง22, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
4.  Wineries; small wineries.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 4 
following provisions apply to wineries and small wineries.  For the purposes of this 5 
subsection, wineries and small wineries include manufacturers of hard cider licensed by 6 
the bureau as wineries and small wineries in accordance with this section.  7 
A.  A holder of a winery lice nse may produce more than 50,000 gallons per year of 8 
wines, sparkling wines and fortified wines.  9 
B.  A holder of a small winery license may produce not more than 50,000 gallons per 10 
year of wines, sparkling wines and fortified wines.  11 
(1)  A holder of a smal l winery license may sell or deliver its products to licensed 12 
retailers or wholesalers.  The licensee may sell, on the premises for consumption 13 
off the premises, wine produced at the licensed premises by the bottle, by the 14 
case or in bulk to licensed retai lers, including, but not limited to, off -premises 15 
retail licensees, restaurants and clubs.  Notwithstanding section 1361, the licensee 16 
may sell its products directly to a retail licensee under this paragraph without 17 
selling to a wholesale licensee.  18 
(2)  A holder of a small winery license, upon application to and approval of the 19 
bureau and payment of the license fees, may obtain licenses for off -premises 20 
consumption for up to 2 additional locations other than the location of the in -state 21 
manufacturer license d under this section.  The holder of the licenses is not 22 
required to conduct any bottling or production at the additional licensed locations 23 
but may conduct all activities permitted by this section at the additional licensed 24 
locations.  For the holder of a  small winery license who manufactures only hard 25 
cider, one of the additional locations may be at the site of the orchard or farm 26 
from which fruit is harvested in the production of the hard cider.  The orchard or 27 
farm must be owned by the holder of the sma ll winery license who produces hard 28 
cider, but the orchard or farm may be a corporation that is separate from the small 29 
winery.  30 
C.  A holder of a winery or small winery license may fortify wine produced by the 31 
winery license holder and import spirits solel y for this purpose.  32 
(1)  If a small winery license holder produces fortified wine pursuant to this 33 
paragraph, the combined total of wine, sparkling wine and fortified wine 34 
produced at the small winery may not exceed 50,000 gallons per year.  35 
For purposes of  this subsection, "fortified wine" means wine to which spirits have been 36 
added as long as the resulting liquor does not exceed 24% alcohol by volume.  37 
SUMMARY  38 
This bill clarifies that hard cider manufactured by the holder of a winery or small 39 
winery license  is subject to the same provisions as wine.  The bill provides that one of the 40

 additional locations where a small winery may sell its product, including hard cider, may 1 
be at the farm or orchard where the fruit used to make the cider was harvested.  It als o 2 
provides that the farm or orchard must be owned by the license holder but may be a 3 
corporation that is separate from the winery.  4
