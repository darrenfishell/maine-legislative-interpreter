D. The registered tenant of the club suite or individual specifically granted access to 
the club suite by the civic auditorium signs a contract with the civic auditorium

For purposes of this subsection, "club suite" means a designated area within a civic 
auditorium designed to provide premium viewing of an event in the auditorium and to 
which access is limited to registered tenants, invited guests and those who have been 
specifically granted access by the operator of the civic auditorium and is not accessible to 
the general public or civic auditorium patrons with tickets that provide for general 
admission to that event at the auditorium. A club suite must have a clearly designated

years of age to be present at a Class A restaurant, club, civic auditorium or hotel function 
room when part of an entertainment perfonnance group and may require that a person 
under 17 years of age when part of an entertainment perfonnance group be supervised by 
a parent or legal guardian or by a responsible adult designated as a guardian.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment clarifies that a license to serve 
alcoholic beverages under a civic auditorium license may be issued to the owner of the 
auditorium, a contracted operator or the vendor who provides alcoholic beverages to 
patrons of the auditorium. The amendment, like the bill, repeals the requirement that a 
civic auditorium provide at least 24 hours' notice prior to holding any event where 
alcoholic beverages will be served. The amendment also provides for a definition of 
"club suite" and establishes limitations under which spirits may be sold in original 
containers for service within the suite, including a limit of 6 containers of spirits products. 
Finally, the amendment directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations to amend rules governing the 
presence of persons 18 years of age or younger at a venue where they are part of a 
perfonnance group providing entertainment where alcoholic beverages may be sold.
