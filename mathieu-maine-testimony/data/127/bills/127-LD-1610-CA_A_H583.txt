The bill entitles a spouse, and children under 21 years of age, of certain veterans to free admission to all state parks 
and historic sites, resulting in a reduction in General Fund revenue of $154,776 in fiscal year 2016-17. 
This legislation removes the $25 annual service fee on veterans vanity license plates and would result in a reduction in 
Highway Fund revenue of $78,360 beginning in fiscal year 2016-17. 
The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds deallocation of $52,240 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Municipal 
Bond Bank to reflect the loss of $10 of the annual service fee transferred to the Trans Cap Trust Fund.
