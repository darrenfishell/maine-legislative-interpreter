COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT"~" to H.P. 898, L.D. 1320 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment strikes from the bill the provisions that apply the same requirements 
3 of driving time needed in order to be eligible for a special restricted license for education 
4 and employment needs as exists in current law for medical needs. 
5 The amendment revises language in current law that gives the Secretary of State 
6 discretion to reject or recall a vanity plate that consists of or comprises language that is 
7 obscene, contemptuous, profane or prejudicial and replaces it with language that gives the 
8 Secretary of State discretion to reject or recall a vanity plate that consists of language that 
9 encourages violence or may result in an act of violence or other unlawful activity because 
10 of the content of the language requested by the registrant. 
11 The amendment clarifies that reports made or received in determining whether a 
12 person is qualified to be issued a driver's license may be used by the medical personnel 
13 treating the person. 
14 The amendment requires that a form created by the Commissioner of Public Safety 
15 must be used by scrap metal processors to collect and keep certain information when a 
16 scrap metal transaction occurs. 
17 The amendment strikes from the bill provisions that make operation of a motor 
18 vehicle while having a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, level of 5 nanograms or 
19 more per milliliter of blood a criminal offense .. The amendment also strikes provisions 
20 that authorize the Secretary of State to suspend administratively the license of a person 
21 who with a THC level of 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of blood operates a motor 
22 vehicle and that sanction the use of approved preliminary breath test devices by law 
23 enforcement officers in determining whether a person operated a motor vehicle while 
24 under the influence of intoxicants.
