Fiscal Note 
Minor savings -General Fund 
Removing requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services to educate recipients of Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families on appropriate uses of the benefits and to track the cost of implementing and enforcing 
the prohibitions in this bill will create some minor savings to the department. Removing the penalties for certain 
violations that were added by the bill will have no fiscal impact because existing federal penalties are more stringent.
