telecommunications services providers used to make a determination under paragraph 
A is confidential and is not a public record under Title 1, section 402, subsection 3 
and may not be disclosed to any person outside the commission. In developing the 
methodology under this paragraph, the commission may allow for reasonable 
adjustments to the information it receives if it is aware that actual availability of 
competitive services differs from what is reflected in the information. If the

application of the commission's methodology results in a finding that the standards in 
paragraph A, subparagraph (1) have been met, there is a rebuttable presumption of 
sufficient competition in a municipality to ensure access to affordable telephone 
service by households in the municipality, 
C. Ninety days prior to filing a petition under this subsection, a price cap ILEC shall 
notify the commission and the Office of the Public Advocate of the price cap ILEC's 
intent to file a petition. The price cap ILEC shall also give advance notice of its 
intent to file a petition in its monthly billing statement to each customer in the 
municipality in which it will be seeking relief from the obligation to provide provider 
of last resort service. 
The commission shall hold a public hearing in each affected municipality to allow 
customers of the price cap ILEC as well as other residents of the affected 
municipality to testify. The price cap ILEC shall give advance notice of the hearing 
to each customer in the municipality in its monthly billing statement and publish this 
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in that municipality. 
D. The commission shall issue an order granting or denying a petition within 180 
days of receiving a petition under this subsection, except that the commission, at its 
discretion, may extend this period for up to an additional 30 days. 
E. For 5 years from the date the commission issues an order granting a price cap 
ILEC relief from the obligation to provide provider of last resort service in a 
municipality, the price cap ILEC shall continue to offer to each provider of last resort 
service customer in that municipality to whom it was providing the service on the 
date of that order a telephone service with the same rates, terms and conditions as it 
provides to provider of last resort service customers to whom it is obligated to 
provide provider of last resort service. 
For purposes of this subsection, "voice network service provider" has the same meaning 
as in section 7104. 
6. Abandonment. A price cap ILEC may not discontinue, reduce or impair the 
service that it provides in a municipality, or part of a municipality, where it has 
previously served as the provider of provider of last resort service unless the commission 
approves the discontinuance, reduction or impairment. The commission may approve the 
discontinuance, reduction or impairment only if it finds that neither the present nor future 
public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected by such discontinuance, 
reduction or impairment of service. 
In granting its approval under this subsection, the commission may impose such terms, 
conditions or requirements as in its judgment are necessary to protect the public interest. 
A price cap ILEC abandoning all or part of its plant, property or system or discontinuing 
service pursuant to authority granted by the commission under this subsection is deemed 
to have waived all objections to the terms, conditions or requirements imposed by the 
commission in its approval. A discontinuance approved under this subsection is not 
subject to further approval under section 1104. 
7. Rules. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are major substantive rules as

6 conditions for provider of last resort service. Rates for provider of last resort service 
7 provided by the price cap ILEC are governed by the following:

23 or require a service provider to provide rebates or rate reductions if the commission finds, 
24 after investigation, that a service provider has failed to meet service quality standards. If 
25 a price cap ILEC fails to meet any service quality standard and the commission concludes 
26 after investigation that the failure to meet the service quality standard is due to factors 
27 within the control of the price cap ILEC, the commission shall, by order, direct the price 
28 cap ILEC to take such steps as the commission determines necessary to improve service 
29 to the level needed to meet the standard. If the provider fails to comply with the 
30 commission's order, the commission shall impose a penalty in accordance with section 
31 1508-A, subsection 1, paragraph A in an amount sufficient to ensure compliance with that 
32 order. Nothing in this section limits the commission's authority to direct a price cap 
33 ILEC to act to improve service under any other provision of this chapter.

35 substantive rules, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375,
