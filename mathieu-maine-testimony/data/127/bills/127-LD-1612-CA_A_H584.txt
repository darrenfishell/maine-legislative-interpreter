14 This amendment specifies the agencies with which the Director of the Bureau of 
15 Maine Veterans' Services within the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
16 Management is authorized to enter into memoranda of understanding to help achieve the 
17 marketing and outreach program objectives outlined in the bill. The amendment specifies 
18 that the records management system is intended to help the bureau meet certain 
19 outcomes. The bill states that the system itself must be capable of meeting those 
20 outcomes. It also removes the requirement that the records management system be 
21 capable of identifying burial locations on maps of the Maine Veterans' Memorial 
22 Cemetery System. The amendment strikes the provision in the bill that requires a 
23 veterans' service organization that receives funds from the Coordinated Veterans 
24 Assistance Fund to provide the Director of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' Services with 
25 data demonstrating that the funds are being used to assist veterans in filing claims with 
26 the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. It also strikes the provision in the bill 
27 that requires the director to regularly conduct an assessment of the number and 
28 geographic distribution of veteran service officers employed by the bureau. Finally, the 
29 amendment adds an appropriations and allocations section that provides for funding for 
30 the records management system required by the bill, 2 additional veterans service officers 
31 to be employed by the bureau and funding to make permanent the position of Veterans 
32 Outreach Specialist, which is currently a 2-year contracted position.
