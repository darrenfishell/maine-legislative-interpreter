(4)  Whether the individ uals occupying beds that are proposed to be relocated are 7

SUMMARY  10 
This bill requires the certificate of need process to take into account the effect of the 11 
loss of nur sing facility beds on the community's health and economy and on family 12 
members and the individuals occupying the beds.  The existing process examines only the 13 
need for new beds in an area where beds have been proposed.  14
