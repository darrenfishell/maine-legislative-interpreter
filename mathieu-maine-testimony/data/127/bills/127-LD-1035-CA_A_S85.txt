Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium savings -General Fund 
Limiting the number of days a person capable of working and who does not have any dependents may receive general 
assistance benefits to 275 days every 5 years may produce savings to the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS). Since General Assistance is administered by municipalities, DHHS does not have client specific data to 
detennine how long recipients have received benefits. If implemented, municipalities would manage the new 
limitation and lower their requests for reimbursement by the State. The number of clients who currently exceed the 9-
month time limit is not estimated to be a significant percentage of all clients.
