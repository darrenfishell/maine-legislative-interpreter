SUMMARY  7 
This bill strengthens the restrictions on a driver of a motor v ehicle under a learner's 8 
permit by increasing the requirements regarding the age of the accompanying licensed 9 
driver and the length of time that driver has held a driver's license and increasing the 10 
length of time a permit holder is required to have a lear ner's permit before obtaining a 11 
driver's license.  The bill also expands the definition of "mobile telephone" to include 12 
devices providing access to voice, text messaging or Internet service as it applies to a 13 
driver with a learner's permit or a driver ope rating under a restricted license.  This bill 14 
also strengthens the restrictions on a driver of a motor vehicle who is under 18 years of 15 
age operating under a restricted license by prohibiting the driver from carrying immediate 16 
family members without an acc ompanying licensed driver, decreasing the time period 17 
during which a driver with a restricted license may operate a motor vehicle unless 18 
traveling to and from work and requiring the driver to display decals in the motor vehicle 19 
indicating that the driver m ay be a holder of a restricted license.  Finally, the bill changes 20 
the fine for using a mobile telephone while driving under a restricted license to $500 and 21 
sets the fine for failing to display a restricted license reflective decal at $100.  22
