SUMMARY  13 
This bill authorizes law enforcement officers and juvenile community corrections 14 
officers to refer juveniles w ho commit minor offenses to diversion or restorative justice 15 
programs.  In order to facilitate the effectiveness of these programs, the protection 16 
provided against admissibility in evidence for admissions made at other early stages of 17 
the juvenile justice process is provided for admissions made in connection with these 18 
diversion and restorative justice programs.  An outdated reference to "community 19 
resolution teams" is also removed.  20 
The bill adds to the protections of the victim notification statute by requ iring victim 21 
notification of funeral and deathbed visits by prisoners, by adding to the definition of 22 
"victim" a person who has obtained from a court a protection from abuse order or 23 
received the court's approval for a protection from abuse agreement and b y allowing 24 
victims to request notification directly from the Department of Corrections.  25 
The bill allows a court to revoke the probation of an offender who has contact with a 26 
victim during incarceration if contact has been prohibited as a condition of proba tion. 27 
The bill clarifies that the exemption from the payment of a health care copayment for 28 
certain mentally ill or developmentally disabled prisoners applies only to health care 29 
addressing the mental illness or developmental disability and not to unrelate d health care.  30 
These provisions apply to both jail and Department of Corrections prisoners.  The bill 31 
also removes a provision that is outdated as a result of recently enacted statutes 32 
prohibiting anyone under 18 years of age from being incarcerated in an  adult facility.  33 
The bill removes language providing that certain positions in the Department of 34 
Corrections serve at the pleasure of the commissioner.  The positions include facility 35 
heads and regional community corrections administrators.  36 
The bill expand s the arrest powers of probation officers so that, in addition to the 37 
other categories of offenders they may arrest, they are also authorized to arrest escapees 38 
from facilities of the Department of Corrections.  39 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR2032(01) -1 
 The bill repeals an outdated uniform intersta te compact for juveniles.  1 
The bill amends the provision of law requiring a court sentencing a juvenile bound 2 
over and convicted as an adult to imprisonment to commit the juvenile to a Department of 3 
Corrections juvenile facility until the person attains 18 years of age, with any 4 
imprisonment time remaining after the person attains 18 years of age to be served in an 5 
adult facility.  Currently, this provision is limited to certain serious crimes.  The bill 6 
eliminates the limitation, thus preventing a person wh o has not attained 18 years of age 7 
who commits a less serious crime from being incarcerated in an adult facility.  8
