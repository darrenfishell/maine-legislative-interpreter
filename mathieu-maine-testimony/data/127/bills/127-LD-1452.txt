Fiscal Detail and NotesFiscal Note
This bill makes technical changes to statutory language related to the educational opportunity tax credit and the sales 
tax fairness credit changes included in the 2016-2017 Biennial Budget (LD 1019) as engrossed. These changes result in an increase in General Fund revenue of $39,900 in 2016-17 above the revenue estimates assumed for LD 1019 as engrossed.  This bill also removes an appropriation of $27,975,000 for 2016-17 included in Part A of LD 1019 as engrossed that is no longer needed for the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Reimbursement program and should have been removed as a result of the Floor Amendment to the Committee Amendment to LD 1019 as engrossed.  Part J of  LD 1019 as engrossed limits the amount of spending for the Homestead Property Tax Exemption Reimbursement program to the appropriated amount  included in Part UUUU of LD 1019, making the appropriation in Part A unnecessary.  This bill also provides funding for one Tax Examiner position and related costs to review and process additional claims for the educational opportunity tax credit.127th MAINE LEGISLATURE
