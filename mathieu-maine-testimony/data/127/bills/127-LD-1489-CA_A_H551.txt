Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation requires the State Controller to pay $75,000 to College for ME -Adroscoggin from fiscal year 2015-
16 year-end unobligated funds in the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools Program General Fund account within 
the Department of Education brought forward into fiscal year 2016-17. The ability for this transaction to occur is

the subsequent fiscal year in each of the past 5 years, with the net balance carried forward averaging approximately 
$10.2 million.
