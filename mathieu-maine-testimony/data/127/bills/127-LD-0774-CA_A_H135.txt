FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 527, L.D. 774, Bill, "An Act To Assist 
Victims of Crime To Obtain Restitution" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 17-A MRSA ยง1330-C is enacted to read: 
ยง1330-C. Civil remedy upon default 
Upon the request of the attorney for the State or a person entitled to restitution under 
an order of restitution, the clerk shall enter the order of restitution in the same manner as 
a judgment in a civil action. When entered under this section, the order of restitution is 
deemed to be a money judgment. Upon default, the order to make restitution is 
enforceable in accordance with Title 14, chapter 502 by any person entitled to restitution 
under the order.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and provides a civil remedy for victims of crime 
when restitution has not been paid as ordered. The amendment requires that an order to 
make restitution be entered by the clerk in the same manner as a judgment in a civil 
action at the request of the attorney for the State or a person entitled to restitution under 
the order. The amendment provides that after the order is entered in the same manner as 
a judgment in a civil action, the order is deemed a money judgment enforceable in 
accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 14, chapter 502.
