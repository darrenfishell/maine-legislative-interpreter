Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment strikes 
from the bill the defInition of "public easement" and defInes that term instead by 
reference to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 3021, subsection 2 and provides 
a defmition of "emergency responder." The amendment provides an exception for an 
emergency responder that is similar to the exception in current law for a law enforcement 
officer.
