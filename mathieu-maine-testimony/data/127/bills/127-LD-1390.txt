 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 14 -A established the policy, 3 
composition and duties of the Capitol Planning Commission for the purpose of 4 
developing effective planning to accommodate the needs of a growing State Government; 5 
and 6 
Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 814, subsection 2 delineates 7 
the boundaries of the Capitol Area within the City of Augusta over which the Capitol 8 
Planning Commission has planning jurisdiction; and  9 
Whereas, since 1920 the Department of Transportation has owned and occupied a 10 
9-acre parcel of land on the northerly side of Capitol Street kn own as the motor transport 11 
property for use as a highway maintenance facility; and  12 
Whereas, due to the functional obsolescence of the motor transport property, the 13 
Department of Transportation recently relocated its highway maintenance operations to a 14 
mode rn facility elsewhere in Augusta and now desires to sell the motor transport 15 
property; and  16 
Whereas, the motor transport property is located within the Capitol Area boundaries 17 
and is subject to the agency rules established by the Capitol Planning Commissio n that 18 
govern the use and development of Capitol Area property; and   19 
Whereas, sale of the motor transport property has been impeded by the conditions 20 
and restrictions imposed by Capitol Planning Commission rules, which originally 21 
envisioned the site for u se as a state office building or parking garage; and  22 
Whereas, the need for a new state office building or state parking garage has been 23 
eliminated due to the extensive renovation of both of the existing facilities in recent 24 
years; and  25 
Whereas, the motor tr ansport property is now vacant, deteriorating and creating 26 
potentially detrimental health, safety and environmental conditions; and  27 
Whereas, removal of the motor transport property from Capitol Planning 28 
Commission restrictions as soon as possible is necess ary to enhance the property's 29 
marketability, expedite its sale and eliminate its current industrial use in favor of the 30 
development of a commercial, mixed -use site that will augment the City of Augusta's tax 31 
base and contribute to the overall aesthetic of the Capitol Area's West Campus; and  32 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 33 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 34 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the publ ic peace, health and safety; now, 35 
therefore,  36 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  37
