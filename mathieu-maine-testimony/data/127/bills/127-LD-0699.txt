 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration 3 
implemented changes to its  injury and illness recordkeeping requirements that became 4 
effective January 1, 2015; and  5 
Whereas, the State became a so -called state plan state for public sector employers in 6 
an effort to decrease General Fund costs and employer costs; and  7 
Whereas, state plan states must conform their statutes to the new federal provisions 8 
no later than July 1, 2015; and  9 
Whereas, the State's lack of compliance with the injury and illness recordkeeping 10 
requirements would cause loss of reimbursement to the State; and  11 
Whereas , in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 12 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 13 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 14 
therefore , 15 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  16 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §2, as repealed and replaced by PL 2003, c. 244, §1, is amended 17

SUMMARY  26 
This bill ensures that the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Standards is in 27 
compliance with recent changes made by the federal Occupational Safety and Health 28 
Administration to its injury and illness recordkeeping requirements.  The federal 29 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires state  plan states to implement 30 
these changes to conform to the new requirements no later than July 1, 2015, or risk a 31 
loss of federal reimbursement.  32 
Under current law, a person in charge of a workplace is required to report in writing 33 
or by telephone to the Dir ector of the Bureau of Labor Standards the death of any person 34 
in the workplace or a serious physical injury requiring hospitalization sustained by a 35 
person in the workplace.  This bill replaces the requirement to report in writing or by 36 
telephone with a r equirement to report by telephone or electronically and provides that 37 
the report may be made to the director or the director's designee.  It amends the definition 38 
of "serious physical injury."  It also authorizes the director and any authorized agent of 39 
the bureau to enter a public sector workplace for the purpose of examining the safety and 40 
health of employees.  41
