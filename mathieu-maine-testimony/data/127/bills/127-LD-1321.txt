SUMMARY  12 
This bill amends the landowner relations program within the Department of Inland 13 
Fisheries and Wildlife by adding to the program the requirement that t he Commissioner 14

recreationists and the nonprofit organizations representing these outdoor recreationists, 16 
and must provide ongoing education to these groups and individ uals about good 17 
landowner relations.  18 
The bill gives the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, instead of the 19

expands the board’s duties to include an annual stakeholder meeting and an annual 22 
reporting requirement.  23 
This bill also directs the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to establish a 24 
Keep Maine Clean program to recruit volun teers to pick up trash along roadsides, fields 25 
and forests while they are walking, hiking, fishing and otherwise enjoying public and 26 
private lands.  27
