28 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 563, L.D. 1462 
(3) All records related to activities under a manufacturer license issued under 
this section must be kept separate from records related to the retail license. 
(4) A distillery or small distillery must meet the requirements of subsection 5, 
eaFa~anh paragraphs D and E. 
(5) The licensee shall ensure that products purchased for off-premises 
consumption under paragraph D are not consumed on the licensed premises. 
Sec. 2. 28-A MRSA §1355-A, sub-§2, ,rK is enacted to read: 
K. A person with multiple facilities licensed for the manufacture of liquor under this 
section may transfer product produced by the licensee from one licensed facility of 
that person to another licensed facility of that person for the purposes of selling for 
off-premises or on-premises consumption as permitted by laws administered by the 
United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 
Bureau, including any requirements to maintain records regarding transfers between 
facilities.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. This amendment clarifies existing law that permits 
a person that is licensed to manufacture malt liquor, wine or spirits at a facility in the 
State to sell the product that person produces from the manufacturing facility for off­
premises consumption without having to get a separate off-premises retail license. The 
amendment specifies that the location of the manufacturing facility where off-premises 
sales of the manufacturer's product occur is not required to be accessed by a separate 
entrance from the area of the facility that is licensed to serve alcoholic beverages for on­
premises consumption. 
The amendment clarifies that distilleries and small distilleries are subject to the 
existing law that requires spirits sold at retail to first be listed for sale and distributed by 
the State. Finally, the amendment adds a provision reflecting federal law that permits a 
manufacturer who manufactures at multiple licensed locations to transport the 
manufacturer's own product between those locations.
