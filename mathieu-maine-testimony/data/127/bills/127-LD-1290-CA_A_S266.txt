contingent upon approval of the voters of the State by referendum.

Nov-15 General Referendum Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery ofa second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of$107,250 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
If approved by the voters in a statewide referendum, the Maine Clean Election Act would be repealed. Repeal would 
increase General Fund revenue by $2,000,000 annually from eliminating the annual transfer from the General Fund to 
the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) at the Commission on Govenunental Ethics and Election Practices 
(Commission). The MCEF revenue from collecting qualifying contributions from candidates and from receiving $3 
voluntary contributions from taxpayers would also be eliminated. Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the 
Commission would be eliminated and payments to candidates would be stopped. One Registration and Reporting 
Officer position would be eliminated and 5 positions would need to be moved to the General Fund. These 5 positions 
relate to functions that would continue after repeal and General Fund appropriations would be required. 
To the extent that taxpayers who owe money to the State at the end of the tax year currently elect to contribute $3 to 
the Maine Clean Election Fund through the income tax f01111 checkoff, General Fund and Local Govemment Fund 
revenue is reduced. This reduction would disappear. The amount received annually by this checkoff is approximately 
$130,000.
