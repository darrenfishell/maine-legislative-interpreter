 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  23 MRSA ยง3026 -A is enacted to read:  2 
ยง3026 -A.  Maintenance of public easements held by a municipality  3 
A public easement held by a municipality must be maintained by the municipality to 4 
ensure use and enjoyment in accordance with section 3021, subsection 2.  5 
Sec. 2.  23 MRSA ยง3028, sub -ยง1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 195, is amended to 6 
read:  7 
1.  Presumption of abandonment.  It is prima facie evidence that a town or county 8 
way not kept passabl e for the use of motor vehicles at the expense of the municipality or 9 
county for a period of 30 or more consecutive years has been discontinued by 10 
abandonment.  A presumption of abandonment may be rebutted by evidence that 11 
manifests a clear intent by the m unicipality or county and the public to consider or use the 12 
way as if it were a public way.  A proceeding to discontinue a town or county way may 13 
not prevent or estop a municipality from asserting a presumption of abandonment.  A 14 
municipality or its offici als are not liable for nonperformance of a legal duty with respect 15 
to such ways if there has been a good faith reliance on a presumption of abandonment.  16 
Any person affected by a presumption of abandonment, including the State or a 17 
municipality, may seek d eclaratory relief to finally resolve the status of such ways.  A 18 
way that has been abandoned under this section is relegated to the same status as it would 19 
have had after a discontinuance pursuant to section 3026, except that this status is at all 20 
times su bject to an affirmative vote of the legislative body of the municipality within 21 
which the way lies making that way an easement for recreational use.  If the municipality 22 
votes affirmatively to make the way an easement for recreational use, the municipality  23 
shall maintain the easement for such use.   A presumption of abandonment is not rebutted 24 
by evidence that shows isolated acts of maintenance, unless other evidence exists that 25 
shows a clear intent by the municipality or county to consider or use the way as  if it were 26 
a public way.  27 
SUMMARY  28 
This bill provides that a municipality must maintain a public easement held by the 29 
municipality to ensure use and enjoyment in accordance with the definition of a public 30 
easement.  A municipality must also maintain an ease ment when a municipality votes 31 
affirmatively to make a way an easement for recreational use.  32
