SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the bill and instead provides that a person 5 years of age or 
older who is enrolled in public day school is required to attend during the time it is in 
regular session. This amendment provides that a person 5 years of age or older and under 
7 years of age may withdraw from school at any time within the 45 days after enrollment, 
and may withdraw from school after 45 days after enrollment after consultation with the 
school board or its designee. This amendm<!nt provides that students who are at least 5 
years of age and enrolled in a public day school are subject to the same provisions 
regarding truancy as students who are at least 7 years of age and have not completed 
grade 6 who are required to attend a public day school. This amendment clarifies that a 
person 5 years of age or older and under 7 years of age is not required to meet the 
alternatives to attendance requirements set forth in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
20-A, section 500l-A, subsection 3.
