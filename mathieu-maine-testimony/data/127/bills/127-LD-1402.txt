 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  22 MRSA §3762, sub -§3, ¶B, as amended by PL 2013, c. 368, Pt. OO, 2

accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 5 
this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 6 
families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance  for families described in this 7 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  8 
(1)  To continue the pass -through of the first $50 per month of current child 9 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 10 
tests and benefit calculations;  11 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 12

Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the  categories of 14 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 15 
aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 16 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients o f 17 
assistance from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  18 
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household 19 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 20 
for service. A non citizen legally admitted to the United States who is neither 21 
receiving assistance on July 1, 2011 nor has an application pending for assistance 22 
on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 23 
through a state -funded program u nless that noncitizen is:  24

(3) To provide benefits to certain 2 -parent families whos e deprivation is based on 35 
physical or mental incapacity;  36 
(4)  To provide an assistance program for needy children, 19 to 21 years of age, 37 
who are in full -time attendance in secondary school.  The program is operated for 38 
those individuals who qualify for TA NF under the United States Social Security 39
