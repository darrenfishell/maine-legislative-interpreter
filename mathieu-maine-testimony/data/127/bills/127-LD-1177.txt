 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
PART A  2 
UNIFORM FIDUCIARY ACCESS TO DIGITAL ASSETS ACT  3 
PREFATORY NOTE  4 
The purpose of this act is to vest fiduciaries with the authority to access, control, or 5 
copy digital assets and accounts.  T he act applies only to fiduciaries, who must always act 6 
in compliance with their fiduciary powers and duties.  The goal of the Uniform Fiduciary 7 
Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA) is to remove barriers to a fiduciary's access to 8 
electronic records and t o leave unaffected other law, such as fiduciary, probate, trust, 9 
banking, investment securities, and agency law.  Existing law prohibits any fiduciary 10 
from violating fiduciary responsibilities by divulging or publicizing any information the 11 
fiduciary obtai ns while carrying out his or her fiduciary duties.  12 
UFADAA addresses four different types of fiduciaries: personal representatives of 13 
decedents' estates, conservators for protected persons and individuals, agents acting 14 
pursuant to a power of attorney, and trustees.  It distinguishes the authority of fiduciaries, 15 
which exercise authority subject to this act only on behalf of the account holder, from any 16 
other efforts to access the digital assets.  Family members or friends may seek such 17 
access, but, unless t hey are fiduciaries, their efforts are subject to other laws and are not 18 
covered by this act.  19 
As the number of digital assets held by the average person increases, questions 20 
surrounding the disposition of these assets upon the individual's death or incapac ity are 21 
becoming more common.  Few laws exist on the rights of fiduciaries over digital assets.  22 
Few holders of digital assets and accounts consider the fate of their online presences once 23 
they are no longer able to manage their assets.  And these assets h ave real value: 24 
according to a 2011 survey from McAfee, Intel's security -technology unit, American 25 
consumers valued their digital assets, on average, at almost $55,000.  Kelly Greene, 26 
Passing Down Digital Assets , WALL STREET JOURNAL  (Aug. 31, 2012), 27 
http://goo.gl/7KAaOm .  These assets range from online gaming items to photos, to 28 
digital music, to client lists.  There are millions of Internet accounts that belong to dead 29 
people.  Some Internet service providers have expli cit policies on what will happen when 30 
an individual dies, others do not; even where these policies are included in the 31 
terms -of-service agreement, most consumers click through these agreements.  32 
The situation regarding fiduciaries' access to digital assets is less than clear, and is 33 
subject to federal and state privacy and computer "hacking" laws as well as state probate 34 
law.  A minority of states has enacted legislation on fiduciary access to digital assets, and 35 
numerous other states have considered, or are  considering, legislation.  Existing 36 
legislation differs with respect to the types of digital assets covered, the rights of the 37 
fiduciary, the category of fiduciary included, and whether the principal's death or 38 
incapacity is covered.  A uniform approach a mong states will provide certainty and 39 
predictability for courts, account holders, fiduciaries, and Internet service providers.  It 40 
gives states precise, comprehensive, and easily accessible guidance on questions 41 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 concerning fiduciaries' ability to access t he electronic records of a decedent, protected 1 
person, principal, or a trust.  For issues on which states diverge or on which the law is 2 
unclear or unknown, the act will for the first time provide uniform rules.  3 
The general goal of the act is to facilitate  fiduciary access while respecting the 4 
privacy and intent of the account holder.  It adheres to the traditional approach of trusts 5 
and estates law, which respects the intent of the account holder and promotes the 6 
fiduciary's ability to administer the accou nt holder's property in accord with legally - 7 
binding fiduciary duties.  8 
With regard to the general scope of the act, the act's coverage is inherently limited by 9 
the definition of "digital assets."  The act applies only to electronic records, which do not 10 
include the underlying asset or liability unless it is itself an electronic record.  11 
The act is divided into fifteen sections.  Sections 1 -2 contain general provisions and 12 
definitions, including those relating to the scope of the fiduciary's authority.  13 
Section  3 governs applicability, clarifying the scope of the act and the fiduciaries who 14 
have access to digital assets under UFADAA.  Section 3 states that the act does not apply 15 
to the digital assets of an employer used by an employee during the ordinary course of 16 
business.  17 
Sections 4 -7 establish the rights of personal representatives, conservators, agents 18 
acting pursuant to a power of attorney, and trustees.  Each of the fiduciaries is subject to 19 
different opt -in and default rules based on the presumed intent of  the account holder and 20 
the applicability of other state and federal laws.  A personal representative is presumed to 21 
have access to all of the decedent's digital assets unless that is contrary to the decedent's 22 
expressed intent or to other applicable law.  A conservator may access digital assets 23 
pursuant to a court order.  An agent acting pursuant to a power of attorney is presumed to 24 
have access to all of a principal's digital assets not subject to the protections of other 25 
applicable law; if another law pr otects the asset, then the power of attorney must 26 
explicitly grant access.  And a trustee may access any digital asset held by the trust unless 27 
that is contrary to the terms of the trust or to other applicable law.  28 
Section 8 contains general provisions rel ating to the rights of the fiduciary to access 29 
digital assets.  Section 9 addresses compliance, and Section 10 grants immunity to 30 
custodians.  Sections 11 -15 address miscellaneous topics, including retroactivity, the 31 
effective date of the act, and similar issues.  The act addresses only the rights of the four 32 
types of fiduciaries, and it is designed to provide access without changing the ownership 33 
of the digital asset.  34 
Sec. A -1.  18-A MRSA, art. 10 is enacted to read:  35

Comment  35 
(Maine section 10 -102 is base d on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 36 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 Act section 2.)  1 
Many of the definitions are based on those in the Uniform Probate Code: agent (UPC 2 
Section 1 -201(1)), conservator (UPC Section 5 -102(1)), court (UPC Section 1 -201(8)), 3 
electronic (UPC Sect ion 5B -102(3)), fiduciary (UPC Section 1 -201(15)), governing 4 
instrument (UPC Section 1 -201(18)), person (UPC Section 5B -101(6)), personal 5 
representative (UPC Section 1 -201(35)), power of attorney (UPC Section 5B -102(7)), 6 
principal (UPC Section 5B -102(9)), property (UPC Section 1 -201(38)), protected person 7 
(UPC Section 5 -102(8)), record (UPC Section 1 -201(41)), and will (UPC Section 8 
1-201(57)).  The definition of "information" is based on that in the Uniform Electronic 9 
Transactions Act, Section 2, subsection  (11).  Many of the other definitions are either 10 
drawn from federal law, as discussed below, or are new for this act.  11 
An account holder includes any person who entered into a terms -of-service 12 
agreement with a custodian, including a deceased individual who entered into the 13 
agreement during the individual's lifetime.  A fiduciary is defined as a person, and a 14 
fiduciary can be an account holder when the fiduciary opens the account.  15 
The definition of "carries" is drawn from federal law, 47 U.S.C. Section 1001(8 ). 16 
The term "catalogue of electronic communications" in Section 2(4) is designed to 17 
cover log -type information about an electronic communication such as the email 18 
addresses of the sender and the recipient, and the date and time the communication was 19 
sent.   20 
The term "content of an electronic communication" in Section 2(6) is adapted from 21 
18 U.S.C. Section 2510(8), which provides that content: "when used with respect to any 22 
wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any information concerning the 23 
substance, purport, or meaning of that communication."  The 2(6) definition is designed 24 
to cover only content subject to the coverage of Section 2702 of the Electronic 25 
Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), 18 U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.; it does not include 26 
conte nt not subject to ECPA.  Consequently, the "content of an electronic 27 
communication", as used later throughout UFADAA, refers only to information in the 28 
body of an electronic message that is not readily accessible to the public; if the 29 
information were read ily accessible to the public, it would not be subject to the privacy 30 
protections of federal law under ECPA.  See S. Rep. No. 99 -541, at 36 (1986).  When the 31 
privacy protections of federal law under ECPA apply to the content of an electronic 32 
communication, the act's legislative history notes the requirements for disclosure: "Either 33 
the sender or the receiver can directly or through authorized agents authorize further 34 
disclosures of the contents of their electronic communication."  S. Rep. No. 99 -541, at 37 35 
(1986).  36 
ECPA does not apply to private e -mail service providers, such as employers and 37 
educational institutions.  See 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(a)(2); James D. Lamm, Christina L. 38 
Kunz, Damien A. Riehl and Peter John Rademacher, The Digital Death Conundrum: 39 
How  Federal and State Laws Prevent Fiduciaries from Managing Digital Property , 68 U. 40 
Miami L. Rev. 385, 404 (2014) (available at: http://goo.gl/T9jX1d ). 41 
Example:  X uses a Twitter account to send a message. If the tweet is sent only to 42 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 other people who have been granted access to X's tweets, then it meets the Act's 1 
definition of "content of an electronic communication." But, if the tweet is completely 2 
public with no access restrictions, then it does not meet the  Act's definition of "content of 3 
an electronic communication."  4 
 A custodian includes any Internet service provider as well as any other entity that 5 
provides or stores electronic data of an account holder.  A custodian does not include 6 
most employers becaus e an employer typically does not have a terms -of-service 7 
agreement with an employee.  The treatment of digital assets of an employer used by an 8 
employee in the ordinary course of the employer's business is discussed in Section 3.  9 
The definition of a digita l asset specifies that it is "a record that is electronic."  10 
Because records may exist in both electronic and non -electronic formats, this definition 11 
clarifies the scope of the act and the limitation on the type of records to which it applies.  12 
The term in cludes products currently in existence and yet to be invented that are available 13 
only electronically.  It refers to any type of electronically -stored information, such as: 1) 14 
any information stored on a computer and other digital devices; 2) content upload ed onto 15 
websites, ranging from photos to documents; and 3) rights in digital property, such as 16 
domain names or digital entitlements associated with online games.  See Lamm, et al, 17 
supra , at 388.  Both the catalogue and content of an electronic communicatio n are 18 
covered by the term "digital assets."  19 
The fiduciary's access to a record defined as a "digital asset" does not mean that the 20 
fiduciary is entitled to "own" the asset or otherwise engage in transactions with the asset.  21 
Consider, for example, funds in  a bank account or securities held with a broker or other 22 
custodian, regardless of whether the bank, broker, or custodian has a brick -and-mortar 23 
presence.  This act affects records concerning the bank account or securities, but does not 24 
affect the authorit y to engage in transfers of title or other commercial transactions in the 25 
funds or securities, even though such transfers or other transactions might occur 26 
electronically.  UFADAA simply reinforces the right of the fiduciary to access all 27 
relevant electron ic communications and the online account that provides evidence of 28 
ownership or similar rights.  An entity may not refuse to provide access to online records 29 
any more than the entity can refuse to provide the fiduciary with access to hard copy 30 
records.  31 
The definition of "electronic communication" in Section 2(11) is that set out in 18 32 
U.S.C. Section 2510(12):  33 
"electronic communication" means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, 34 
sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, 35 
radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate 36 
or foreign commerce, but does not include โ 37 
(A) any wire or oral communication;  38 
(B) any communication made through a tone -only paging device;  39 
(C) any c ommunication from a tracking device (as defined in section 3117 of 40 
this title); or  41 
(D) electronic funds transfer information stored by a financial institution in a 42 
communications system used for the electronic storage and transfer of funds.  43 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 The definition of "electronic -communication service" in Section 2(12) is drawn from 1 
18 U.S.C. Section 2510(15): "any service which provides to users thereof the ability to 2 
send or receive wire or electronic communications."  The definition of 3 
"remote -computing service" i n Section 2(22) is adapted from 18 U.S.C. Section 2711(2): 4 
"the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an 5 
electronic communications system." The definition refers to 18 U.S.C. Section 2510(14), 6 
which defines an elect ronic communications system as: "any wire, radio, electromagnetic, 7 
photooptical or photoelectronic facilities for the transmission of wire or electronic 8 
communications, and any computer facilities or related electronic equipment for the 9 
electronic storage of such communications."  10 
Electronic communication is a particular type of digital asset and covers only the 11 
category of digital assets subject to the privacy protections of the Electronic 12 
Communications Privacy Act.  For example, material stored on a compu ter's hard drive is 13 
a digital asset but not an electronic communication.  14 
A "fiduciary" under this act occupies a status recognized by state law, and a 15 
fiduciary's powers under this act are subject to the relevant limits established by other 16 
state laws.  Th e definition of fiduciary specifically applies to "each person" in order to 17 
cover co -fiduciaries.  18 
The term "record" includes information available in both tangible and electronic 19 
media.  The act applies only to electronic records.  20 
The "terms -of-service agr eement" definition relies on the definition of "agreement" 21 
found in UCC Section 1 -201(b)(3) ("the bargain of the parties in fact, as found in their 22 
language or inferred from other circumstances, including course of performance, course 23 
of dealing, or usage of trade").  It refers to any agreement that controls the relationship 24 
between an account holder and a custodian, even though it might be called a terms -of-use 25 
agreement, a click -wrap agreement, a click -through license, or a similar term.  State and 26 
federa l law determine capacity to enter into a binding terms -of-service agreement.  27 
ยง10-103.  Applicablity  28 
(a).  This Act applies to:  29 
(1).  A fiduciary or agent acting under a will or power of attorney executed before, on 30 
or after January 1, 2016;  31 
(2).  A persona l representative acting for a decedent who died before, on or after 32 
January 1, 2016;  33 
(3).  A conservatorship proceeding, whether pending in a court or commenced before, 34 
on or after January 1, 2016; and  35 
(4).  A trustee acting under a trust created before, o n or after the effective date of this 36 
Act. 37 
(b).  This Act does not apply to a digital asset of an employer used by an employee in 38 
the ordinary course of the employer's business.  39

 Comment  1 
(Maine section 10 -103 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digi tal Assets 2 
Act Section 3.)  3 
This act does not change the substantive rules of other law, such as agency, banking, 4 
conservatorship, contract, copyright, criminal, fiduciary, privacy, probate, property, 5 
security, trust, or other applicable law except to vest fiduciaries with authority, according 6 
to the provisions of this act, to access, control, or copy digital assets of a decedent, 7 
protected person (or other individual under Section 5), principal, settlor, or trustee.  8 
Subsection (a)(2) covers the situations i n which a decedent dies intestate, so it falls 9 
outside of subsection (a)(1), as well as the situations in which a state's procedures for 10 
small estates are used.  11 
Subsection (b) clarifies that the act does not apply to a fiduciary's access to an 12 
employer's i nternal email system.  13 
Example 1 โFiduciary access to an employee e -mail account.   D dies, employed by 14 
Company Y.  Company Y has an internal e -mail communication system, available only to 15 
Y's employees, and used by them in the ordinary course of Y's business .  D's personal 16 
representative, R, believes that D used Company Y's e -mail system to effectuate some 17 
financial transactions that R cannot find through other means.  R requests access from 18 
Company Y to the e -mails.  19 
Company Y is not a custodian subject to th e act.  Under Section 2(7), a custodian 20 
must carry, maintain or store an account holder's digital assets.  An account holder, in 21 
turn, is defined under Section 2(1) as someone who has entered into a terms -of-service 22 
agreement.  Company Y, like most employe rs, did not enter into a terms -of-service 23 
agreement with D, so D was not an account holder.  24 
Example 2 โEmployee of electronic -communication service provider.   D dies, 25 
employed by Company Y.  Company Y is an electronic -communication service provider.  26 
Compan y Y has an internal e -mail communication system, available only to Y's 27 
employees and used by them in the ordinary course of Y's business.  D used the internal 28 
Company Y system.  When not at work, D also used an electronic -communication service 29 
system that Company Y provides to the public.  D's personal representative, R, believes 30 
that D used Company Y's internal e -mail system as well as Company Y's 31 
electronic -communication system available to the public to effectuate some financial 32 
transactions.  R seeks ac cess to both communication systems.  33 
As is true in Example 1, Company Y is not a custodian subject to the act for purposes 34 
of the internal email system.  The situation is different with respect to R's access to 35 
Company Y's system that is available to the pu blic.  Assuming that Company Y can 36 
disclose the communications under federal law, then Company Y must disclose them to 37 
R. 38

 ยง10-104.  Access by personal representative to digital asset of decedent  1 
Subject to section 10 -108, subsection (b) and unless otherwis e ordered by the court or 2 
provided in the will of a decedent, the personal representative of the decedent has the 3 
right to access:  4 
(a).  The content of an electronic communication that the custodian is permitted to 5 
disclose under the Electronic Communicati ons Privacy Act, 18 United States Code, 6 
Section 2702(b);  7 
(b).  Any catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the decedent; 8 
and 9 
(c).  Any other digital asset in which at death the decedent had a right or interest.  10 
Comment  11 
(Maine section 10 -104 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 12 
Act Section 4.)  13 
This section is modeled on the formulation of the personal representative's default 14 
power set out in UPC Section 3 -715.  The phrase, "unless otherwiseโฆprovided by the 15 
will," is intended to indicate that a will controls the personal representative's authority.  16 
As is true more generally with respect to interpretation of wills, public policy can 17 
override the explicit terms of a will.  18 
The section clarifies the difference between fid uciary authority over digital assets 19 
other than the content of an electronic communication protected by ECPA and authority 20 
over ECPA -covered content of an electronic communication.  For the content of an 21 
electronic communication, subsections (1) and (2) es tablish procedures that cover: first, 22 
the ECPA -covered content of communications and, second, the catalogue (logs and 23 
records) that electronic communications service providers may release without consent 24 
under the ECPA.  Federal law distinguishes between t he permissible disclosure of the 25 
"content" of an electronic communication, covered in 18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b), and of 26 
"a record or other information pertaining to a" subscriber or customer, covered in 18 27 
U.S.C. Section 2702(c); see Matthew J. Tokson, The Content/Envelope Distinction in 28 
Internet Law , 50 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 2105 (2009).  29 
Content -based material can, in turn, be divided into two types of communications: 30 
those received by the account holder and those sent.  Federal law, 18 U.S.C. Section 31 
2702(b)  permits a custodian to "divulge the contents of a communication "(1) to an 32 
addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or 33 
intended recipient" or "(3) with the lawful consent of the originator or an addressee or 34 
intended recipient of such communication, or the subscriber in the case of remote 35 
computing service."  36 
Consequently, when the account holder is the "addressee or intended recipient," 37 
material can be disclosed either to that individual or to an agent for that pe rson, 18 U.S.C. 38 
Section 2702(b)(1), and it can also be disclosed to third parties with the "lawful consent" 39 
of the addressee or intended recipient.  18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(3).  Material for which 40 
 
 Page 10 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 the account holder is the "originator" can be disclosed t o third parties only with the 1 
account holder's "lawful consent."  18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(3).  (Note that, when the 2 
account holder is the addressee or intended recipient, material can be disclosed under 3 
either (b)(1) or (b)(3), but that when the account holder is the originator, lawful consent is 4 
required under (b)(3).)  See the Comments concerning the definition of "content" after 5 
Section 2.  By contrast to content -based material, non -content material can be disclosed 6 
either with the lawful consent of th e account holder or to any person (other than a 7 
governmental entity) even without lawful consent.  This information includes material 8 
about any communication sent, such as the addressee, sender, date/time, and other 9 
subscriber data, which this act defines as the "catalogue of electronic communications."  10

ยง10-105.  Access by conservator to digital asset of protected person  13 
Subject to section 10 -108, subsection (b ), the court, after an opportunity for hearing 14 
under Article 5, Part 4, may grant a conservator the right to access:  15 
(a).  The content of an electronic communication that the custodian is permitted to 16 
disclose under the Electronic Communications Privacy Ac t, 18 United States Code, 17 
Section 2702(b);  18 
(b).  Any catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the protected 19 
person; and  20 
(c).  Any other digital asset in which the protected person has a right or interest.  21 
Comment  22 
(Maine section 10 -105 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 23 
Act section 5.)  24 
Section 5 establishes that the conservator must be specifically authorized by the court 25 
to access the protected person's digital assets.  Each of the different levels of access to the 26 
content of an electronic communication, to the catalogue of electronic communications, 27 
and to any other digital assets must be specifically granted by court order.  The 28 
requirement in Section 5 for express authority over digital assets does not limit the 29 
fiduciary's authority over the underlying assets, such as funds held in a bank account.  30 
The meaning of the term "hearing" will vary from state to state according to state law and 31 
procedures.  32 
Section 5 is comparable to Section 4.  It responds to the concern s of Internet service 33 
providers who believe that the act should be structured to clarify the difference between 34 
fiduciary authority over digital assets other than the content of an electronic 35 
communication protected by federal law (the Electronic Communica tions Privacy Act 36 
(ECPA)), and fiduciary authority over ECPA -protected content of an electronic 37 
communication.  Consequently, Section 5 sets out separate procedures for digital assets as 38 
well as the catalogue of electronic communications (logs and records)  that relevant 39 
service providers may release without consent under ECPA, and the ECPA -covered 40 
 
 Page 11 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 content of an electronic communication.  1 
The section refers to an individual or a protected person because a conservator may 2 
be appointed for a single transaction or without a finding that the person is a protected 3 
person.  4 
State law will establish the criteria for when a court will grant power to the 5 
conservator.  For example, UPC Section 5 -411(c) requires the court to consider the 6 
decision the protected person woul d have made as well as a list of other factors.  Existing 7 
state law may also set out the requisite standards for a conservator's actions.  Under 8 
Section 8, if access to digital assets is granted by the court, the conservator has the same 9 
power over digital  assets as the account holder.  The conservator must exercise authority 10 
in the interests of the protected person.  11 
ยง10-106.  Access by agent to digital asset of principal  12 
(a).  To the extent a power of attorney expressly grants an agent authority over the 13 
content of an electronic communication of the principal and subject to section 10 -108, 14 
subsection (b), the agent has the right to access the content of an electronic 15 
communication that the custodian is permitted to disclose under the Electronic 16 
Communicatio ns Privacy Act, 18 United States Code, Section 2702(b).  17 
(b).  Subject to section 10 -108, subsection (b) and unless otherwise ordered by the 18 
court or provided by a power of attorney, an agent has the right to access:  19 
(1).  Any catalogue of electronic commun ications sent or received by the principal; 20 
and 21 
(2).  Any other digital asset in which the principal has a right or interest.  22 
Comment  23 
(Maine section 10 -106 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 24 
Act section 6.)  25 
This section establishes that the agent has default authority over all of the principal's 26 
digital assets, other than the content of the principal's electronic communications.  When 27 
the principal does not want the agent to exercise such broad authority, then the power of 28 
attorney m ust explicitly prevent an agent from doing so.  An agent has access to the 29 
content of electronic communications only when the power of attorney explicitly grants 30 
access.  31 
Paragraph (a) is modeled on UPC Section 5B -201(a).  Because a power of attorney 32 
contai ns the consent of the account holder, ECPA should not prevent the agent from 33 
exercising authority over the content of an electronic communication.  See the Comments 34 
concerning the definitions of the "content of an electronic communication" after Section 35 
2.  There should be no question that an explicit delegation of authority in a power of 36 
attorney constitutes authorization from the account holder to access digital assets and 37 
provides "lawful consent" to allow disclosure of the content of an electronic 38 
 
 Page 12 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 commu nication from an electronic -communication service or a remote -computing service 1 
pursuant to applicable law.  Both authorization and lawful consent are important because 2 
18 U.S.C. Section 2701 deals with intentional access without authorization and 18 U.S.C . 3 
Section 2702 allows a service provider to disclose with lawful consent.  Federal courts 4 
have not yet interpreted how ECPA affects a fiduciary's efforts to access the content of an 5 
electronic communication.  E.g., In re Facebook, Inc. , 923 F. Supp. 2d 120 4 (N.D. Cal. 6 
2012).  7 
ยง10-107.  Access by trustee to digital asset  8 
(a).  Subject to section 10 -108, subsection (b) and unless otherwise ordered by the 9 
court or provided in a trust, a trustee that is an original account holder has the right to 10 
access any digi tal asset held in trust, including any catalogue of electronic 11 
communications of the trustee and the content of an electronic communication.  12 
(b).  Subject to 10 -108, subsection (b) and unless otherwise ordered by the court or 13 
provided in a trust, a trustee  that is not an original account holder has the right to access:  14 
(1).  The content of an electronic communication that the custodian is permitted to 15 
disclose under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 United States Code, 16 
Section 2702(b);  17 
(2).  Any catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the original or 18 
any successor account holder; and  19 
(3).  Any other digital asset in which the original or any successor account holder has 20 
a right or interest.  21 
Comment  22 
(Maine section 10 -107 is base d on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 23 
Act Section 7.)  24 
Subsection (a) clarifies that access to digital assets, including the content of electronic 25 
communications, is presumed with respect to assets for which the trustee is the initial 26 
account holder.  A trustee may have title to digital assets when the trustee opens an 27 
account as trustee; under those circumstances, the trustee can access the content of each 28 
digital asset that is in an account for which the trustee is the original account holder , not 29 
necessarily each digital asset held in the trust.  30 
Subsection (b) addresses situations involving an inter vivos transfer of a digital asset 31 
into a trust, a transfer into a testamentary trust, or a transfer via a pourover will or other 32 
governing instru ment of a digital asset into a trust.  In those situations, a trustee becomes 33 
a successor account holder when the settlor transfers a digital asset into the trust.  There 34 
should be no question that the trustee with legal title to the digital asset was auth orized by 35 
the settlor to access the digital assets so transferred, including both the catalogue and 36 
content of an electronic communication, and this provides "lawful consent" to allow 37 
disclosure of the content of an electronic communication from an 38 
electro nic-communication service or a remote -computing service pursuant to applicable 39 
 
 Page 13 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 law.  See the Comments concerning the definitions of the "content of an electronic 1 
communication" after Section 2.  Nonetheless, subsection (2) distinguishes between the 2 
catalog ue and content of an electronic communication in case there are any questions 3 
about whether the form in which property transferred into a trust is held constitutes lawful 4 
consent.  Both authorization and lawful consent are important because 18 U.S.C. Secti on 5 
2701 deals with intentional access without authorization and because 18 U.S.C. Section 6 
2702 allows a service provider to disclose with lawful consent.  7 
The underlying trust documents and default trust law will supply the allocation of 8 
responsibilities be tween and among trustees.  9 
ยง10-108.  Fiduciary authority  10 
(a).  A fiduciary that is an account holder or has the right under this Act to access a 11 
digital asset of an account holder:  12 
(1).  Subject to the terms of service agreement, copyright law and other app licable 13 
law, may take any action concerning the asset to the extent of the account holder's 14 
authority and the fiduciary's power under the law of this State other than this Act;  15 
(2).  Has, for the purpose of applicable electronic privacy laws, the lawful co nsent of 16 
the account holder for the custodian to divulge the content of an electronic 17 
communication to the fiduciary; and  18 
(3).  Is, for the purpose of applicable computer fraud and unauthorized computer 19 
access laws, including Title 17 -A, chapter 18, an aut horized user.  20 
(b).  Unless an account holder, after January 1, 2016, agrees to a provision in a terms 21 
of service agreement that limits a fiduciary's access to a digital asset of the account holder 22 
by an affirmative act separate from the account holder's as sent to other provisions of the 23 
agreement:  24 
(1).  The provision is void as against the strong public policy of this State; and  25 
(2).  The fiduciary's access under this Act to a digital asset does not violate the terms 26 
of service agreement even if the agreeme nt requires notice of a change in the account 27 
holder's status.  28 
(c).  A choice of law provision in a terms of service agreement is unenforceable 29 
against a fiduciary acting under this Act to the extent the provision designates law that 30 
enforces a limitation on a fiduciary's access to a digital asset, and the limitation is void 31 
under subsection (b).  32 
(d).  As to tangible personal property capable of receiving, storing, processing or 33 
sending a digital asset, a fiduciary with authority over the property of a dece dent, 34 
protected person, principal or settlor:  35

unauthorized computer access laws, including Titl e 17-A, chapter 18.  38 
 
 Page 14 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 Comment  1 
(Maine section 10 -108 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 2 
Act Section 8.)  3 
This issue concerning the parameters of the fiduciary's authority potentially arises in 4 
two situations: 1) the fiduciary obtains ac cess to a password or the like directly from the 5 
account holder, as would be true in various circumstances such as for the trustee of an 6 
inter vivos trust or someone who has stored passwords in a written or electronic list and 7 
those passwords are then tran smitted to the fiduciary; and 2) the fiduciary obtains access 8 
pursuant to this act.  9 
This section clarifies that the fiduciary has the same authority as the account holder if 10 
the account holder were the one exercising the authority (note that, where the acc ount 11 
holder has died, this means that the fiduciary has the same access as the account holder 12 
had immediately before death).  This means that the fiduciary's authority to access the 13 
digital asset is the same as the account holder except where, pursuant to subsection (b), 14 
the account holder has explicitly opted out of fiduciary access.  In exercising its 15 
responsibilities, the fiduciary is subject to the duties and obligations established pursuant 16 
to state fiduciary law and is liable for breach of those dutie s.  Note that even if the digital 17 
asset were illegally obtained by the account holder, the fiduciary would still need access 18 
in order to handle that asset appropriately.  There may, for example, be tax consequences 19 
that the fiduciary would be obligated to report.  20 
In exercising its responsibilities, the fiduciary is subject to the same limitations as the 21 
account holder more generally.  For example, a fiduciary cannot delete an account if this 22 
would be fraudulent.  Similarly, if the account holder could chall enge provisions in a 23 
terms -of-service agreement, then the fiduciary is also able to do so.  See Ajemian v. 24 
Yahoo!, Inc. , 987 N.E.2d 604 (Mass. 2013).  25 
Subsection (a) is designed to establish that the fiduciary is authorized to exercise 26 
control over digital assets in accordance with other applicable laws.  The language 27 
mirrors that used in Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 28 
(ECPA), also known as the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq.  29 
(2006); see, e.g. , Orin S.  Kerr, A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and a 30 
Legislator's Guide to Amending It , 72 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1208 (2004).  The subsection 31 
clarifies that state law treats the fiduciary as "authorized" under the two federal statutes 32 
that prohibit u nauthorized access to computers and computer data, ECPA and the 33 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as pursuant to any comparable state laws 34 
criminalizing unauthorized access.  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 35 
1030 (2006); Lamm, et al., su pra (state law may be useful to federal courts interpreting 36 
these statutes.)  37 
ECPA contains two potentially relevant prohibitions.  The first, 18 U.S.C. Section 38 
2701(a), defines the crime of unlawful access to stored communications, which applies to 39 
a perso n who "(1) intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an 40 
electronic communication service is provided; or (2) intentionally exceeds an 41 
authorization to access that facilityโฆ."  Thus, someone who has authorization to access 42 
 
 Page 15 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 the fa cility is not engaging in criminal behavior.  Moreover, this section does not apply to 1 
"conduct authorizedโฆby a user of that service with respect to a communication of or 2 
intended for that user."  18 U.S.C. Section 2701(a), (c)(2).  3 
The second, 18 U.S.C. Se ction 2702, entitled "Voluntary disclosure of customer 4 
communications or records," concerns actions by the service provider.  It prohibits an 5 
electronic -communication service or a remote -computing service from knowingly 6 
divulging the content of an electron ic communication that is stored by or carried or 7 
maintained on that service unless disclosure is made (among other exceptions) "to an 8 
addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or 9 
intended recipient" or "with the lawful consent  of the originator or an addressee or 10 
intended recipient of such communication, or the subscriber in the case of 11 
remote -computing service."  18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b)(1), (3) (emphasis added).  See the 12 
Comments concerning the definitions of the  "content of an electronic communication" 13 
after Section 2.  The statute permits disclosure of "customer records" that do not include 14 
content, either with lawful consent from the customer or "to any person other than a 15 
governmental entity."  18 U.S.C. Secti on 2702(c)(2) and (6).  Thus, in contrast to its 16 
restrictions on the release of content, the electronic -communication or remote -computing 17 
service provider is permitted to disclose the catalogue of electronic communications to 18 
anyone except the government.  19 
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) prohibits unauthorized access to 20 
computers.  18 U.S.C. Section 1030.  Like ECPA, the CFAA similarly protects against 21 
anyone who "intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds 22 
authorized access."  18 U.S.C. Section 1030(a).  23 
State laws vary in their coverage but typically prohibit unauthorized computer access.  24 
By defining the fiduciary as an authorized user: 1) the fiduciary has authorization 25 
under applicable law to access the digital assets under t he first relevant provision of 26 
ECPA, 18 U.S.C. Section 2701, as well as under the CFAA; and 2) the fiduciary has "the 27 
lawful consent" of the originator/subscriber under applicable law so that the service 28 
provider can voluntarily disclose the digital assets  pursuant to the second  relevant 29 
provision of ECPA, 18 U.S.C. Section 2702, including the content of an electronic 30 
communication.  Moreover, this language should be adequate to avoid liability under the 31 
state unauthorized computer access laws.  32 
Subsection ( a)(1) states that the fiduciary can take actions to the extent of the 33 
fiduciary's power under the law of this state.  Note that the fiduciary's powers under state 34 
law are defined by statute, common law, and the terms of the governing instrument.   35 
Subsecti on (b) addresses whether account holders can opt out of the rules in this act 36 
and whether Internet service providers can prevent fiduciary access.  First, a 37 
terms -of-service agreement in which an account holder has made an affirmative choice to 38 
limit a fid uciary's right to access will supersede any contrary provision in a will, trust, 39 
protective order, or power of attorney.  The affirmative act must clearly demonstrate the 40 
account holder's deliberate intent to prevent fiduciary access.  Second, the subsecti on 41 
provides that any other term in a terms -of-service agreement that bars fiduciary access is 42 
void as against the state's strong public policy.  While all of a state's laws could be 43 
 
 Page 16 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 considered that state's public policy, the phrase "strong public policy" i s to be construed 1 
under conflict of laws principles to protect fiduciary access to digital assets under this act, 2 
notwithstanding a contrary terms -of-service agreement provision and even if the 3 
terms -of-service agreement chooses the law of another state or  country to govern its 4 
contractual rights and duties.  See Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws ยง 90 and ยง 187 5 
cmt. G; see also  Uniform Trust Code ยง 107(1).  However, a terms -of-service agreement 6 
provision for which an account holder has made an affirmati ve choice, separate from the 7 
account holder's assent to other provisions of the terms -of-service agreement, to limit a 8 
fiduciary's access to the account holder's digital assets is not voided by this act and will 9 
supersede any contrary provision in a will, or trust. ( See Example 5).  10 
Subsection (b) reinforces the concept that the fiduciary "steps into the shoes" of the 11 
account holder, with no more โand no fewer โrights.  For example, the terms -of-service 12 
agreement controls the rights of the account holder (sett lor, principal, incapacitated 13 
person, decedent).  The act does not permit the account holder's fiduciary to override the 14 
terms -of-service agreement in order to make a digital asset or collection of digital assets 15 
"descendible," although it does preserve th e rights of the fiduciary to make the same 16 
claims as the account holder.  See Ajemian v. Yahoo!, Inc. , 987 N.E.2d 604 (Mass. 2013); 17 
David Horton, Indescendibility , 102 Calif. L. Rev. 543 (2014).  18 
Under subsection (b), access by a fiduciary should not be con sidered a transfer or 19 
other use that would violate the anti -transfer terms or other terms of a terms -of-service 20 
agreement.  21 
Subsection (c) supports the importance of fiduciary access by providing that any 22 
choice of law governing the effect of a terms -of-service agreement that prevents fiduciary 23 
access is unenforceable.  24 
Subsection (d) clarifies that the fiduciary is authorized to access digital assets stored 25 
on tangible personal property, such as laptops, computers, smartphones or storage media 26 
of the deceden t, protected person, principal, or settlor, exempting fiduciaries from 27 
application for purposes of state or federal laws on unauthorized computer access.  For 28 
criminal law purposes, this clarifies that the fiduciary is authorized to access all of the 29 
accou nt holder's digital assets, whether held locally or remotely.  30 
Example 1 โAccess to digital assets by personal representative.   D dies with a will 31 
that is silent with respect to digital assets.  D has a bank account for which D received 32 
only electronic state ments, D has stored photos in a cloud -based Internet account, and D 33 
has an e -mail account with a company that provides electronic -communication services to 34 
the public.  The personal representative of D's estate needs access to the electronic bank 35 
account s tatements, the photo account, and e -mails.  36 
The personal representative of D's estate has the authority to access D's electronic 37 
banking statements and D's photo account, which both fall under the act's definition of a 38 
"digital asset."  This means that, if these accounts are password -protected or otherwise 39 
unavailable to the personal representative, then the bank and the photo account service 40 
must give access to the personal representative when the request is made in accordance 41 
with Section 9.  If the terms -of-service agreement permits D to transfer the accounts 42 
electronically, then the personal representative of D's estate can use that procedure for 43 
 
 Page 17 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 transfer as well.  1 
The personal representative of D's estate is also able to request that the e -mail 2 
account se rvice provider grant access to e -mails sent or received by D; ECPA permits the 3 
service provider to release the catalogue to the personal representative.  The service 4 
provider also must provide the personal representative access to the content of an 5 
electro nic communication sent or received by D if the service provider is permitted under 6 
18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b) to disclose the content.  The bank may release the catalogue of 7 
electronic communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is  the 8 
originator or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.  9 
Example 2 โAccess to digital assets by conservator.   C is seeking appointment as the 10 
conservator for P.  P has a bank account for which P received only electronic statements, 11 
P has stored photos in a cloud -based Internet account, and P has an e -mail account with a 12 
company that provides electronic communication services to the public.  C needs access 13 
to the electronic bank account statements, the photo account, and e -mails.  14 
Without a court order that explicitly grants access to P's digital assets, including 15 
electronic communications, C has no authority pursuant to this act to access the electronic 16 
bank account statements, the photo account, or the e -mails.  Based on law outside of th is 17 
act, the bank may release the catalogue of electronic communications or content of an 18 
electronic communication for which it is the originator or the addressee because the bank 19 
is not subject to the ECPA.  20 
Example 3 โAccess to digital assets by agent.   X creates a power of attorney 21 
designating A as X's agent.  The power of attorney expressly grants A authority over X's 22 
digital assets, including the content of an electronic communication.  X has a bank 23 
account for which X receives only electronic statements,  X has stored photos in a 24 
cloud -based Internet account, and X has a game character and in -game property 25 
associated with an online game.  X also has an e -mail account with a company that 26 
provides electronic -communication services to the public.  27 
A has the au thority to access X's electronic bank statements, the photo account, the 28 
game character and in -game property associated with the online game, all of which fall 29 
under the act's definition of a "digital asset."  This means that, if these accounts are 30 
passwor d-protected or otherwise unavailable to A as X's agent, then the bank, the photo 31 
account service provider, and the online game service provider must give access to A 32 
when the request is made in accordance with Section 9.  If the terms -of-service agreement 33 
permits X to transfer the accounts electronically, then A as X's agent can use that 34 
procedure for transfer as well.  35 
As X's agent, A is also able to request that the e -mail account service provider grant 36 
access to e -mails sent or received by X; ECPA permits  the service provider to release the 37 
catalogue.  The service provider also must provide A access to the content of an 38 
electronic communication sent or received by X if the service provider is permitted under 39 
18 U.S.C. Section 2702(b) to disclose the conten t.  The bank may release the catalogue of 40 
electronic communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is the 41 
originator or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.  42 
 
 Page 18 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 Example 4 โAccess to digital assets by trustee.   T is the trustee of a trust established 1 
by S.  As trustee of the trust, T opens a bank account for which T receives only electronic 2 
statements.  S transfers into the trust to T as trustee (in compliance with a 3 
terms -of-service agreement) a game character and in -game property associated with an 4 
online game and a cloud -based Internet account in which S has stored photos.  S also 5 
transfers to T as trustee (in compliance with the terms -of-service agreement) an e -mail 6 
account with a company that provides electronic -communication services to the public.  7 
T is an original account holder with respect to the bank account that T opened, and T 8 
has the ability to access the electronic banking statements.  T, as successor account holder 9 
to S, may access the game character and in-game property associated with the online 10 
game and the photo account, which both fall under the act's definition of a "digital asset."  11 
This means that, if these accounts are password -protected or otherwise unavailable to T 12 
as trustee, then the bank, the  photo account service provider, and the online game service 13 
provider must give access to T when the request is made in accordance with Section 9.  If 14 
the terms -of-service agreement permits the account holder to transfer the accounts 15 
electronically, then T  as trustee can use that procedure for transfer as well.  16 
T as successor account holder of the e -mail account for which S was previously the 17 
account holder is also able to request that the e -mail account service provider grant access 18 
to e-mails sent or rece ived by S; the ECPA permits the service provider to release the 19 
catalogue.  The service provider also must provide T access to the content of an electronic 20 
communication sent or received by S if the service provider is permitted under 18 U.S.C. 21 
Section 270 2(b) to disclose the content.  The bank may release the catalogue of electronic 22 
communications or content of an electronic communication for which it is the originator 23 
or the addressee because the bank is not subject to the ECPA.  24 
Example 5 โAccess notwithst anding terms in a terms -of-service agreement.   D, who 25 
is domiciled in state X, dies.  D was a professional photographer who stored valuable 26 
digital photos in an online storage account provided by C.  P is appointed by a court in 27 
state X to administer D's e state.  P needs access to D's online storage account to inventory 28 
and appraise D's estate assets and to file D's estate tax return.  During D's lifetime, D 29 
entered into a terms -of-service agreement with C for the online storage account.  The 30 
choice -of-law provision selects the law of state Y to govern the contractual rights and 31 
duties under the terms -of-service agreement.  A provision of the terms -of-service 32 
agreement prohibits fiduciary access to the digital assets of an account holder, but D did 33 
not agree  to that provision by an affirmative act separate from D's assent to other 34 
provisions of the terms -of-service agreement.  UFADAA has been enacted by state X but 35 
not by state Y.  Because P's access to D's assets is fundamental to carrying out P's 36 
fiduciary duties, a court should apply subsections (b) and (c) of this act under the law of 37 
state X to void the terms -of-service agreement provision prohibiting P's access to D's 38 
online account, even though the terms -of-service agreement selected the law of state Y to 39 
govern the contractual rights and duties under the terms -of-service agreement.  40 
ยง10-109.  Compliance  41 
(a).  If a fiduciary with a right under this Act to access a digital asset of an account 42 
holder complies with subsection (b), the custodian shall comply with the fiduciary's 43 
request in a record for:  44 
 
 Page 19 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 (1).  Access to the asset;  1 
(2).  Control of the asset; and  2 
(3).  A copy of the asset to the extent permitted by copyright law.  3 
(b).  If a request under subsection (a) is made by:  4 
(1).  A personal representative  with the right of access under section 10 -104, the 5 
request must be accompanied by a certified copy of the letters of authority of the 6 
representative or a court order;  7 
(2).  A conservator with the right of access under section 10 -105, the request must be 8 
accompanied by a certified copy of the court order that gives the conservator 9 
authority over the digital asset;  10 
(3).  An agent with the right of access under section 10 -106, the request must be 11 
accompanied by an original or a copy of the power of attorney t hat authorizes the 12 
agent to exercise authority over the digital asset and a certification of the agent, under 13 
penalty of perjury, that the power of attorney is in effect; and  14 
(4).  A trustee with the right of access under section 10 -107, the request must b e 15 
accompanied by a certified copy of the trust instrument, or a certification of the trust 16 
under Title 18 -B, section 1013, that authorizes the trustee to exercise authority over 17 
the digital asset.  18 
(c).  A custodian shall comply with a request made under su bsection (a) not later than 19 
60 days after receipt.  If the custodian fails to comply, the fiduciary may apply to the 20 
court for an order directing compliance.  21 
(d).  This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of a trust 22 
instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.  23 
Comment  24 
(Maine section 10 -109 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 25 
Act Section 9.)  26 
Subsection (a) allows a fiduciary to request access, control, or a copy of the digital 27 
asset.  The term "co ntrol" means only the ability to move (unless prohibited by copyright 28 
law) or delete that particular asset.  A fiduciary's control over a digital asset is not 29 
equivalent to a transfer of ownership or a laundering of illegally obtained material.  Thus, 30 
this subsection grants the fiduciary the ability to access electronic records, and the 31 
disposition of those records is subject to other laws.  For example, where the account 32 
holder has an online securities account or has a game character and in -game property 33 
associated with an online game, then the fiduciary's ability to sell the securities, the game 34 
character, or the in -game property is controlled by traditional probate law.  The act is 35 
only granting access and "control" in the sense of enabling the fiduciary to do 36 
electronically what the account holder could have done electronically.  Thus, if a 37 
terms -of-service agreement precludes online transfers, then the fiduciary is unable to 38 
make those transfers electronically as well.  39 
 
 Page 20 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 ExampleโFiduciary control over a di gital asset.   D dies with a will disposing of all 1 
D's assets to D's spouse, S.  E is the personal representative for D's estate.  D left a bank 2 
account, for which D only received online statements, and a blog.  3 
E as personal representative of D's estate has  access to both of D's accounts and can 4 
request the passwords from the custodians of both accounts.  If D's agreement with the 5 
bank requires that transferring the underlying title to the account be done in person, 6 
through a hard copy signed by the account holder and the bank manager, then E must 7 
comply with those procedures (signing as the account holder) and cannot transfer the 8 
funds in the account electronically.  If the terms -of-service agreement for the blog 9 
permitted D to transfer the blog electronical ly, then E can make the transfer electronically 10 
as well.  11 
Subsection (c) establishes 60 days as the appropriate time for compliance.  This is 12 
true regardless of the procedure for supplying the requisite trust instrument.  If applicable 13 
law other than this a ct does not prohibit the custodian from complying, then the custodian 14 
must grant access to comply.  This provision should be read in conjunction with the 15 
state's power of attorney act.  16 
Subsection (h) allows for attorneys' fees.  As the comment to Section 7 09 of the 17 
Uniform Trust Code explains, reimbursement under this section may include attorney's 18 
fees and expenses incurred by the trustee in defending an action. However, a trustee is not 19 
ordinarily entitled to attorney's fees and expenses if it is determin ed that the trustee 20 
breached the trust. See 3A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts  ยง 21 
245 (4th ed. 1988).  22 
ยง10-110.  Custodian immunity  23 
A custodian and its officers, employees and agents are immune from liability for an 24 
act or omission d one in good faith in compliance with this Act.  25 
Comment  26 
 (Maine section 10 -110 is based on the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets 27 
Act section 10.)  28 
This section establishes that custodians are protected from liability when they act in 29 
accordance with  the procedures of this act and in good faith.  The types of actions 30 
covered include disclosure as well as transfer of copies.  The critical issue in conferring 31 
immunity is the source of the liability.  Direct liability is not subject to immunity; indirect  32 
liability is subject to immunity.  33 
Direct liability could only arise from noncompliance with a judicial order issued 34 
under section 9.  Upon determination of a right of access under sections 4, 5, 6, or 7, a 35 
court may issue an order to grant access under se ction 9.  Noncompliance with that order 36 
would give rise to liability for contempt.  There is no immunity from this liability.  37 
Indirect liability could arise from granting a right of access under this act.  Access to 38 
a digital asset might invade the privacy  or the harm the reputation of the decedent, 39 
 
 Page 21 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 protected person, principal, or settlor, it might harm the family or business of the 1 
decedent, protected person, principal, or settlor, and it might harm other persons.  The 2 
grantor of access to the digital asse t is immune from liability arising out of any of these 3 
circumstances if the grantor acted in good faith to comply with this act.  If there is a 4 
judicial order under section 9, compliance with the order establishes good faith.  Absent a 5 
judicial order under  section 9, good faith must be established by the grantor's assessment 6 
of the requirements of this act.  7 
ยง10-111.  Uniformity of application and construction  8 
In applying and construing this uniform Act, consideration must be given to the need 9 
to promote uni formity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact 10 
it. 11 
ยง10-112.  Relation to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act  12 
This Act modifies, limits or supersedes the Electronic Signatures in Global and 13 
National Comme rce Act, 15 United States Code, Section 7001 et seq., but does not 14 
modify, limit or supersede Section 101(c) of that Act, 15 United States Code, Section 15

SUMMARY  29 
This bill enacts the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act as the Maine 30 
Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act as a new Article 10 in the Maine Revised 31 
Statutes, Title 18 -A.  The Probate and Trust Law Advisory Commission recommended 32 
enactment in the report submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary pursuant 33 
to Resolve 2013, chapter 27 as amended by Resolve 2 013, chapter 81.  34 
The Prefatory Note and accompanying Comments to the Uniform Fiduciary Access 35 
to Digital Assets Act provide a summary and explanation of the Uniform Fiduciary 36 
 
 Page 22 - 127LR0312(01) -1 
 Access to Digital Assets Act.  The Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act  1 
provides an important update for the Internet age.  A generation ago, files were stored in 2 
cabinets, photos were stored in albums and mail was delivered by a human being.  Today, 3 
people are more likely to use the Internet to communicate and store informat ion.  The 4 
Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act ensures account holders retain control of 5 
their digital property and can plan for its ultimate disposition after their death.  Unless the 6 
account holder instructs otherwise, legally appointed fiducia ries will have the same 7 
access to digital assets as they have always had to tangible assets and the same duty to 8 
comply with the account holder's instructions.  9 
This bill modifies the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act to be 10 
consistent with exis ting Maine law with regard to conservators.  Part B amends Maine's 11 
Uniform Power of Attorney Act to specifically allow a power of attorney to grant 12 
authority to enable the agent to access the content of an electronic communication to be 13 
consistent with the  grant of express authority required by Section 6 of the Uniform 14 
Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, included in this bill as the Maine Revised 15 
Statutes, Title 18 -A, section 10 -106. 16 
Part C provides that this bill takes effect January 1, 2016.  17
