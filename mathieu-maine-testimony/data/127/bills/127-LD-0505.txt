become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the 90 -day period may not terminate until after the beginning of the next 3 
fiscal year; and  4 
Whereas, certain obligations and expenses incident to the operation of state 5 
departments and institutions will become due and payable immediately; and  6 
Whereas, recent reductions in state payments amid continuous and in many cases 7 
drastic increases in loca l road infrastructure improvement needs have created both a 8 
financial emergency and dangerous public safety conditions for local governments and 9 
citizens; and  10 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 11 
the meaning o f the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 12 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 13 
therefore,  14 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  15 
Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §1803 -B, sub-§1, ¶D, as amended by PL 2013, c. 354, Pt. I, 16
