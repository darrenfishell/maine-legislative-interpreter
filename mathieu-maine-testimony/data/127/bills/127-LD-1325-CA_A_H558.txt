30 SUMMARY 
31 This amendment retains the new discontinuance process proposed in the bill for a 
32 municipality to actively terminate its interests in a public way. The bill requires that if a 
33 public easement is to be retained the municipal officers identify the extent of municipal 
34 maintenance and liability responsibilities and any restrictions on how the public may use 
35 the public easement. The amendment instead specifies that when filing an order of 
36 discontinuance the municipal officers must specify whether or not a public easement is 
3 7 retained, and, if this is not specified, the public easement is retained. The new 
38 discontinuance process proposed in the bill specifies steps a municipality must follow to 
39 discontinue a road: the notification of proposed discontinuance to the abutting property 
40 owners; a meeting of municipal officers to discuss the proposed discontinuance and the 
41 filing of an order of discontinuance; a public hearing on the discontinuance; approval of 
42 the order of discontinuance by the municipal legislative body; and the filing of the 
43 certificate of discontinuance by the municipal clerk in the registry of deeds and with the 
44 municipality. The amendment adds that the municipal clerk must provide a photocopy of

the certificate to the Department of Transportation, Bureau of Maintenance and 
Operations and removes the requirement that the clerk file the certificate with the 
municipality. 
The amendment removes from the bill the requirement that abutters of a public 
easement must be granted a right-of-way prior to the filing of a certificate of 
discontinuance if a discontinuance order is approved. 
The amendment removes language in the bill that eliminates presumption of 
abandonment for ways that do not meet the statutory requirements by January 1, 2020. 
Statutory abandonment remains a means for a municipality to actively terminate its 
interests in a public way. 
The amendment retains the provision of the bill that provides that a public utility 
easement is in place whenever a road is discontinued, regardless of whether a public 
easement is retained. 
The amendment retains the provision of the bill that provides that a municipal clerk 
must file a record with the registry of deeds that a town way has been discontinued by 
abandonment if, either on their own or after being presented with evidence of 
abandonment, the municipal officers determine that a town way has been discontinued by 
abandonment. The amendment requires the municipal clerk to provide a copy of the 
document to the. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Maintenance and Operations. 
The amendment retains language in the bill regarding a cause of action for a property 
owner whose property abuts a discontinued or abandoned road with a public easement. 
The property owner may bring a civil action in Superior Court for damages and injunctive 
relief against a person who causes damage to the road. The amendment excludes law 
enforcement officers and emergency responders who damage the road while responding 
to an emergency from having a civil action filed against them. 
Instead of, as in the bill, allowing a municipality to prepare a list of all town ways in 
the municipality maintained with public funds, a list of all town ways discontinued since 
1965 and whether or not a public easement was retained and a list of all town ways 
abandoned since 1965 and whether or not a public easement was retained, the amendment 
allows a municipality to develop or update publicly available inventories of all known 
town ways and former town ways, or segments of town ways, that have been 
discontinued or discontinued by abandonment within its borders. Municipalities may 
include the following information on discontinued town ways: a description of the town 
way or former town way; any known judicial determination regarding the status of a 
public easement on the former town way; the date of the discontinuance; and the 
governmental entity effecting the discontinuance. Municipalities may include the 
following for town ways discontinued by abandonment: a description of the town way or 
former town way; any known judicial determination regarding the status of a public 
easement on the former town way; and the last known date of regular, publicly funded 
maintenance of the town way or former town way or segment of the town way. 
Municipalities may share their inventories with the Department of Transportation, Bureau 
of Maintenance and Operations.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to H.P. 903, L.D. 1325 
1 The Department of Transportation is required to update the joint standing committee 
2 of the Legislature having jurisdiction over state and local government matters by 
3 November 1, 2018 on the status of any road inventories developed by municipalities. 
4 The fiscal note on the amendment identifies a requirement in this amendment as a 
5 potential insignificant state mandate. In order to be a mandate pursuant to the 
6 Constitution of Maine, a provision must require a local unit of government to expand or 
7 modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local revenue. The 
8 committee finds that the provisions identified as a potential mandate do not require a 
9 local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional 
10 expenditures from local revenue. 
11 The requirement in the amendment that a municipality make an appropriate filing in 
12 the registry of deeds if it makes a final determination that a road has been abandoned does 
13 not require an expansion or modification of activities so as to necessitate additional 
14 expenditures from local revenue since there is no requirement that a municipality 
15 abandon one of its roads or determine the road has been abandoned. The amendment 
16 requires only that a municipality take the appropriate legal step of recording a 
17 determination of abandonment if the municipality chooses to make such a determination.

The required local activ;ities in this bill may represent a state mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. If the bill 
does require a local unit of government to expand or modify its activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures 
from local revenue, the state mandate provisions of the Constitution of Maine require either: (1) General Fund 
appropriations be provided to fund at least 90% of any additional necessitated local costs of the mandate; or (2) a 
Mandate Preamble be added to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt the mandate from 
the funding requirement. If the bill does represent a state mandate and neither one of these actions occurs, the local 
units of government will not be required to implement the mandated activities. · 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Additional costs to the Depariment of Transportation associated with receiving documents from municipal clerks and 
reporting on the status of any road inventories developed by municipalities can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
