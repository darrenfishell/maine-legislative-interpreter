 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, implementation of Maine's recently enacted charter school law has 3 
resulted in substantial budgetary challenges for certain school administrative units that 4 
are located within the catchment areas of public charter schools recently approved by the 5 
Maine Charter School Commission; and  6 
Whereas, these challenges demonstrate the need for more timely and transparent 7 
funding provisions enacted as part of the education statutes related to public charter 8 
schools authorized and approved by the Maine Charter School Commission; and  9 
Whereas, the funding mechanism proposed by this Act must be initiated as soon  as 10 
possible in order to enable school boards to make practicable budgetary decisions that 11 
will not be constrained by funding reductions that result from students enrolling in public 12 
charter schools after school administrative units have approved their bud gets for the 13 
2015 -2016 school year; and  14 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 15 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 16 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 17 
therefore,  18 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  19

Sec. 6.  20-A MRSA §15683 -B is enacted to re ad: 16 
§15683 -B.  Public charter schools; calculation of total allocation and state 17 
contribution  18 
Beginning with fiscal year 2015 -16, this section applies to public charter schools 19 
authorized by the Maine Charter School Commission in accordance with the fundin g 20 
provisions established in section 2413 -A. 21 
1.  Calculation of EPS per -pupil rates.  For a public charter school, the 22 
commissioner shall calculate that school's EPS per -pupil rate for each year as follows.  23 
A.  The EPS per -pupil rate for elementary grades i s calculated by multiplying the 24 
number of students from the resident school administrative unit by the resident school 25 
administrative unit's elementary EPS per -pupil rate; then the total elementary cost for 26 
students from each resident school administrative  unit is added and the result divided 27 
by the total elementary student counts in the public charter school.  The result is the 28 
average elementary grade EPS per -pupil rate for the public charter school.  29 
B.  The EPS per -pupil rate for secondary grades is calc ulated by multiplying the 30 
number of students from the resident school administrative unit by the resident school 31 
administrative unit's secondary EPS per -pupil rate; then the total secondary cost for 32 
students from each resident school administrative unit is  added and the result divided 33 
by the total secondary student counts in the public charter school.  The result is the 34 
average secondary grade EPS per -pupil rate for the public charter school.  35 
2.  Pupil counts.  For a public charter school, the commissioner shall determine that 36 
school's student counts for each year as follows.  37 
A.  The basic student count for a public charter school is the average of the 2 pupil 38 
counts for the school for April 1st and October 1st of the most recent calendar year 39 
prior to the y ear of funding.  40 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0282(01) -1 
 B.  The number of economically disadvantaged students for each public charter 1 
school is determined by multiplying the number of pupils by the most recent 2 
available elementary free or reduced -price meals percentage.  The elementary free or 3 
reduced -price meals percentage may be applied to determine the number of 4 
economically disadvantaged students in the public charter school secondary grades.  5 
If the public charter school does not operate elementary grades, the most recent 6 
available secondary  free or reduced -price meals percentage must be used in place of 7 
the elementary free or reduced -price meals percentage.  8 
C.  The number of limited English proficiency students for each public charter school 9 
is the number of limited English proficiency stude nts from the most recent October 10 
count prior to the year of funding.  11 
D.  The number of special education students for each public charter school is the 12 
number of special education students from the most recent October count prior to the 13 
year of funding.  14 
3.  Operating allocation.  For a public charter school, the commissioner shall 15 
determine that school's operating allocation for each year as the sum of:  16 
A.  The base allocation, which is the pupil counts in subsection 2, paragraph A 17 
multiplied by the public charter school's EPS per -pupil rates in subsection 1;  18 
B.  The economically disadvantaged allocation, which is the pupil counts in 19 
subsection 2, paragraph B multiplied by the additional weight for each economically 20 
disadvantaged student pursuant to section 15675, subsection 2;  21 
C.  The limited English proficiency allocation, which is the pupil counts in subsection 22 
2, paragraph C multiplied by the additional weight for each limited English 23 
proficiency student pursuant to section 15675, subsection 1;  24 
D.  The ta rgeted funds for standards -based system allocation, which is based on the 25 
per-pupil amount pursuant to section 15683, subsection 1, paragraph C multiplied by 26 
pupil counts in subsection 2, paragraph A;  27 
E.  The targeted funds for technology resource allocati on, which is based on the per - 28 
pupil amount pursuant to section 15683, subsection 1, paragraph D multiplied by 29 
pupil counts in subsection 2, paragraph A; and  30 
F.  The targeted funds for public preschool to grade 2 student allocation, which is 31 
based on the pr eschool to grade 2 pupil counts in subsection 2, paragraph A 32 
multiplied by the public charter school's elementary EPS per -pupil rates in subsection 33 
1. 34 
The operating allocation calculated pursuant to this subsection must be adjusted by 35 
multiplying it by the  appropriate transition percentage in accordance with section 15671, 36 
subsection 7.  37 
4.  Other subsidizable costs allocation.  For a public charter school, the 38 
commissioner shall determine that school's other subsidizable costs allocation for each 39 
year as th e sum of:  40 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0282(01) -1 
 A.  The gifted and talented allocation pursuant to section 2413 -A, subsection 2, 1 
paragraph A, subparagraph (4);  2 
B.  The special education allocation pursuant to section 2413 -A, subsection 2, 3 
paragraph B; and  4 
C.  The transportation operating alloc ation, which is the statewide per -pupil essential 5 
programs and services transportation operating allocation multiplied by pupil counts 6 
in subsection 2, paragraph A multiplied by the percentage established by the Maine 7 
Charter School Commission for that pub lic charter school but not to exceed 100%.  8 
A public charter school does not pay for its students to attend career and technical 9 
education programs and therefore is not entitled to career and technical education 10 
funding.  The school administrative unit in w hich the public charter school student resides 11 
must pay the cost of attendance for the student at a career and technical education 12 
program.  13 
5.  Total allocation and state contribution.  For a public charter school, the 14 
commissioner shall determine that sch ool's total allocation as the sum of the school's 15 
operating allocation and other subsidizable costs allocation, and this amount is the state 16 
contribution.  17 
6.  Payment of state contribution.  For public charter schools, the commissioner 18 
shall authorize stat e subsidy payments to be made in accordance with the same schedule 19 
of payments for school administrative units pursuant to section 15689 -B. 20 
7.  MaineCare seed.  For public charter schools, the commissioner may deduct from 21 
a public charter school's state su bsidy and pay on behalf of the public charter school 22 
allowable school -based costs that represent the public charter school's portion of 23 
MaineCare payments.  A transfer of payment by the department to the Department of 24 
Health and Human Services must be made  pursuant to a schedule agreed upon by the 25 
Department of Health and Human Services and the department and based on 26 
documentation of payments made from MaineCare funds.  27 
8.  Curtailment adjustment.  In any funding year, if general purpose aid for local 28 
schoo ls funding is curtailed, the public charter school state contribution under this chapter 29 
must be curtailed by the proportional percentage that school administrative units have 30 
been curtailed.  31 
9.  Phase -in procedures for new or newly expanded public charter  schools.  For a 32 
new or newly expanded public charter school, the commissioner shall make a preliminary 33 
calculation of total allocation based on the following:  34 
A.  Estimated student counts not to exceed the enrollment limit established by the 35 
Maine Charter  School Commission;  36 
B.  Estimated rates and weights based on statewide averages; and  37 
C.  The preliminary calculation of total allocation, which must be replaced with 38 
actual student data once students have been enrolled for the new school year.  The 39 
new or newly expanded public charter school must enroll new students no later than 40 
August 1st in the State's student information system.  41
