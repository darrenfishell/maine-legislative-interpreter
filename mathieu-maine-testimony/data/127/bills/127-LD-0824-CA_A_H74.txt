127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "IF to H.P. 558, L.D. 824, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Ethanol Motor Fuel" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 10 MRSA ยง1457, sub-ยง4 is enacted to read: 
4. Ethanol-free motor fuel. A motor fuel distributor, franchisor or refiner may not 
impose any condition, restriction, agreement or understanding that prohibits or limits the 
sale, resale, transfer or purchase of conventional, ethanol-free motor fuel products in the 
State.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment makes a change to a headnote and removes language that makes the 
statutory provision of the bill apply notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary. 
It also removes the requirement in the bill that directs the Commissioner of 
Environmental Protection to convene a stakeholder group to conduct a study regarding 
motor fuel and fuel additives.
