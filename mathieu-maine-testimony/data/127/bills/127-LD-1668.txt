 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes the following changes to the law relating to recruitment, hiring and 2 
retention of state employees:  3 
It specifies that, prior to imp lementing procedures regarding developing and 4 
implementing a system of registers of eligible persons, the Director of Human Resources 5 
within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services is required to meet and 6 
consult with collective bargaining representatives of affected employees;  7 
Current law limits the length of time a person in a temporary position may remain in 8 
that temporary position to no more than one year.  This bill removes that limitation;  9 
It eliminates the requirement that the Directo r of Human Resources place the names 10 
of eligible persons on the register in order of their ratings; and  11 
It repeals language providing that a person may not be removed from the register of 12 
eligible persons for failure to respond in less than 3 months' time to a written inquiry of 13 
the Director of Human Resources or appointing authority regarding availability for 14 
appointment.  It also repeals language providing that a person may not be removed from 15 
the register of eligible persons for failure to be appointed t o a position following 16 
certification.  17
