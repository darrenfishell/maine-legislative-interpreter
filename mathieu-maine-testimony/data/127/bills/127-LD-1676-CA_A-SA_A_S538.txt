14 Amend the amendment by inserting after the substitute title the following: 
15 'Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
16 following: 
17 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not

23 therefore,' '

SENATE AMENDMENT" A" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 689, L.D. 1676 
1 B. Seek to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that a contract entered into under 
2 this section: 
3 ( 1) Provides benefits to ratepayers; 
4 (2) Provides in-state benefits, such as capital investments to improve long-term 
5 viability of the facility, permanent direct jobs, payments to municipalities, 
6 payments for fuel harvested in the State, payment for in-state resource access, in-
7 state purchases of goods and services and construction-related jobs and 
8 purchases; 
9 (3) Reduces greenhouse gas emissions; 
10 (4) Promotes fuel diversity; and 
11 (5) Supports or improves grid reliability. 
12 In selecting among bids, the commission shall determine the total in-state economic 
13 benefits of the contract in an expected annual dollar per megawatt-hour average and the 
14 cost to fund the above-market costs of a contract in an expected annual dollar per 
15 megawatt-hour average. The commission shall consider both of these values for each 
16 proposal to identify those proposals that maximize the overall benefits to the State, and 
17 shall establish a process under which a generator of biomass resources verifies on an 
18 annual basis that the projected in-state economic benefits are generated during the term of 
19 the contract. If the commission concludes that the solicitation conducted under 
20 subsection 2 is not competitive, no bidders may be selected and the commission is not 
21 obligated to enter into a contract. If the commission finds the in-state benefits are not 
22 being achieved, the commission may reduce the contract payment by the percentage 
23 difference between actual in-state benefits achieved and the projected in-state benefits. 
24 4. Cost recovery fund. There is established within the commission a nonlapsing 
25 cost recovery fund, referred to in this section as "the fund." The fund receives funds 
26 allocated or transferred by the Legislature from the unappropriated surplus of the General 
27 Fund in accordance with subsection 7. The commission shall use the fund to pay all 
28 above-market costs of any contract entered into under this section. No more than 50% of 
29 the fund may be awarded to facilities serving the NMISA region. At the close of fiscal 
30 year 2016-17, amounts remaining in the cost recovery fund that the commission has 
31 determined are not needed to pay above-market costs in accordance with subsection 5 
32 must be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund established under the Maine 
33 Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 1532. The commission by rule or order shall establish 
34 how above-market costs are determined and how payments from the fund are made. 
35 5. Cost recovery. The commission shall ensure that all costs and benefits associated 
36 with contracts entered into under this section are allocated as follows: 
37 A. All costs, other than above-market costs, and all direct financial benefits 
38 associated with contracts entered into under this section must be allocated to 
39 ratepayers in accordance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-F 
40 and may not be considered imprudent; and 
41 B. Above-market costs, including any price differential existing at any time during 
42 the term of the contract between the contract price and the prevailing market price at

1 which the capacity resource is sold and any losses derived from contracts for 
2 differences, must be allocated as follows: 
3 (1) To the extent funds are available in the fund under subsection 4, the above-
4 market costs must be paid from the fund; and 
5 (2) If there are insufficient funds available in the fund under subsection 4, any 
6 insufficiency must be allocated to ratepayers in accordance with Title 35-A, 
7 section 3210-F and may not be considered imprudent.' 
8 Amend the amendment in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 8 (page 3, lines 
9 13 to 21 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
10 '8. Transfers of funds. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, at the 
11 close of fiscal year 2015-16, the State Controller, as the next priority after making the 
12 transfers authorized pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, sections 1507, 1511, 
13 1519, 1522 and 1536, shall transfer from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund 
14 to the Cost Recovery Fund, Other Special Revenue Funds account within the Public 
15 Utilities Commission amounts as may be available from time to time, up to a total of 
16 $13,400,000.' 
17 Amend the amendment in section 1 by renumbering the subsections to read 
18 consecutively. 
19 Amend the amendment by striking out all of sections 2 and 3 and inserting the 
20 following: 
21 'Sec. 2. Appropriations and allocations. The following appropriations and 
22 allocations are made.

9 SUMMARY 
10 This amendment: 
11 1. Adds an emergency preamble and clause; 
12 2. Removes language that limits the Public Utilities Commission's authority to enter 
13 into a contract based on the availability of funds in the cost recovery fund; 
14 3. Requires that a biomass resource facility is operating at least at a 50% capacity for 
15 60 days rather than 6 months prior to initiation of the competitive solicitation; 
16 4. Provides that if the Public Utilities Commission concludes that the solicitation is 
17 not competitive, no bidders may be selected; 
18 5. Removes language that requires the Public Utilities Commission to conduct a 
19 competitive solicitation for a combined heat and power solicitation; and 
20 6. Eliminates cost recovery through the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund and instead 
21 directs the State Controller at the close of fiscal year 2015-16 to transfer from the 
22 unappropriated surplus of the General Fund up to $13,400,000 to the cost recovery fund 
23 established for this purpose. At the close of fiscal year 2016-17, amounts remaining in 
24 the cost recovery fund that the commission has determined are not needed to pay above-
25 market costs must be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund established 
26 under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 1532. If funds in the cost recovery 
27 fund are insufficient, the commission is directed to recover the funds through amounts 
28 charged to ratepayers.

This amendment eliminates the $6,700,000 transfer from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund to the Cost Recovery Fund within the 
Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in both fiscal year 2016-17 and 2017-18 and instead directs $13,400,000 to be transferred from the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund at the close of fiscal year 2015-16 following certain statutorily required transfers (the so­
called "cascade"). There is no guarantee that there will be sufficient funds from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to make 
this transfer. In the event that there are insufficient funds in the Cost Recovery Fund, the amendment requires any above-market costs of 
a contract to be allocated to certain ratepayers. The amendment allows up to 50% of funds within the Cost Recovery Fund to go to the 
Northern Maine Independent System Administrator. This amendment also allows the PUC to not enter into any contract if a 
determination from the PUC is made that none of the bids are competitive. The amendment requires any funds remaining in the Cost 
Recovery Fund at the close of fiscal year 2016-17 be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The amendment also adds an emergency preamble and clause, as well as eliminates the requirement that the PUC conduct a solicitation 
to procure certain energy.
