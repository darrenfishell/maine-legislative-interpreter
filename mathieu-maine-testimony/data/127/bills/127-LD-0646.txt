of providing that service to calculate the property tax support for that joint service; 34 
and  35 
B.  Divide the property t ax support for the joint service by the municipality's property 36

SUMMARY  35 
This bill provides an incentive for municipalities to enter into collabor ative 36 
agreements with other municipalities or units of local government to provide joint 37 
services under the terms of the State's longstanding laws governing interlocal 38 
cooperation.  The incentive provided by the bill is the ability of the municipalities 39 
participating in an interlocal agreement to calculate the value of taxable property within 40 
the municipality that is dedicated to financing the joint agreements and cause that value to 41 
be sheltered in the calculation of each municipality's equalized just valu e.  The equalized 42 
just value is a determining factor in the distribution of General Purpose Aid to local 43 
schools, municipal revenue sharing and the apportionment of county taxes.  44
