 political subdivision thereof, under ci rcumstances supporting a reasonable belief that such 1 
property was abandoned, lost or stolen, or otherwise illegally possessed, except property 2 
seized during search and retained and ultimately returned, destroyed or otherwise 3 
disposed of pursuant to a court  order or some other law hereafter  applicable to specific 4

abandoned.  This chapter does not apply to unclaimed personal property that has been 8

country or province if the person is not residing or employed in this State.  If the court is 18 
unable to take physical custody of the license at the time of sentencing, either because the 19 
suspension has been stayed pursua nt to subsection 4 or for any other reason, the license is 20 
void at such time as is specified in the court order.  21 
SUMMARY  22 
This bill repeals a provision of law requiring the District Court to file a monthly 23 
report with the State Auditor regarding fines, surc harges and assessments imposed by the 24 
court and a provision of law requiring clerks of judicial courts accounting to the State 25 
Auditor for all fees received by them or payable to them to do so under oath.  It also 26 
removes the $500 limit on the amount of a fine a person may pay with a credit card.  It 27 
clarifies that if a driver’s license is suspended by order of the court for any conviction for 28 
operating under the influence or for any offense for which the court suspends a license or 29 
registration, and the de fendant does not physically surrender the license in court, the 30 
license is still void, notwithstanding that it remains in the defendant’s possession.  It also 31 
permits the State Court Administrator to order the disposal or destruction of unclaimed 32 
property confiscated at courthouses by judicial marshals if the property remains 33 
unclaimed for more than 30 days.  34
