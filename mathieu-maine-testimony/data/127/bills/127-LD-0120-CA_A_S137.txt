This legislation creates an income tax credit for all users of the Maine Turnpike of up to $100. General Fund and 
Local Government Fund revenues are expected to decrease beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 by $8,360,000 and 
$440,000, respectively. This analysis assumes all volume discount and business turnpike users with a Maine address 
would be eligible for the full credit and other users with a Maine address would be eligible for an average $60 credit. 
It also assumes 25% of the people eligible for the credit will not take advantage of it for various reasons. 
The bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services of 
$40,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 for computer programming and adm inistrative costs to accommodate the tax credit on 
the income tax returns. 
If the Maine Turnpike Authority experienced a significant increase in cash paying users requesting receipts, it may 
incur significant costs to add toll collectors and additional cash lanes.
