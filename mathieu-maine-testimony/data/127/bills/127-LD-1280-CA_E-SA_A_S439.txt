or casino, other than the casino in Oxford County or the slot machine facility in Bangor, 
then the Penobscot Nation or the Passamaquoddy Tribe may not receive funds from the 
Oxford Casino. It provides that, if the Penobscot Nation owns or operates a slot machine 
facility or casino, the Penobscot Nation may not receive a distribution from the Oxford 
Casino and the funds must be deposited in the General Fund and that, if the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe owns or operates a slot machine facility or casino, the 
Passamaquoddy Tribe may not receive a distribution from the Oxford Casino and the 
funds must be deposited in the General Fund. It also provides that, if the Penobscot 
Nation owns or operates a slot machine facility or casino, the Penobscot Nation may not 
receive a distribution from the York County or Cumberland County casino operator and 
the funds must be deposited in the General Fund; if the Passamaquoddy Tribe owns or 
operates a slot machine facility or casino, the Passamaquoddy Tribe may not receive a 
distribution from the York County or Cumberland County casino operator and the funds 
must be deposited in the General Fund; if the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians owns or 
operates a slot machine facility or casino, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians may not

Sponsor: Sen. Patrick of Oxford \: \ ) 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Change to tribal revenue 
Potential future biennium revenue increase -General Fund 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Current law requires that revenue received by the Penobscot Nation or Passamaquoddy Tribe from Oxford Casino or 
Hollywood Casino will instead be retained by the casinos if either tribe begins to receive revenue from a slot machine 
facility or casino other than Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino. This amendment repeals that provision and allows 
the tribes to continue receiving revenue from Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino if they begin to receive additional 
revenue from other gaming facilities. This results in an estimated ~ual revenue increase of $2,527, 134 to the tribes. 
This amendment also disallows certain tribes from receiving revenue from any Maine casino if that tribe owns or 
operates their own casino, reducing revenue by an estimated $276,679 for each tribe that does so. The amendment 
directs that revenue to be deposited into the General Fund, rather than be retained by the casino.
