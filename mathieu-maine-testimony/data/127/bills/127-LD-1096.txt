 SUMMARY  1 
This bill creates the crime of intentional interference with business operations, which 2 
is committed when a person intentionally hinders, impairs or obstructs or attempts  to 3 
hinder, impair or obstruct the performance of a business operation, including damaging or 4 
rendering inoperable property of an organization, including buildings, equipment or 5 
critical infrastructure, on private or public property, on a private or public  way or within a 6 
railroad right -of-way or energy infrastructure corridor.  Intentional interference with 7 
business operations is a Class E crime, except that a person who refuses to stop 8 
interfering when ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer commits  a Class D crime.  9 
If, at the time of the violation, the person has 2 or more prior Maine convictions for 10 
intentional interference with business operations, the person commits a Class C crime.  11
