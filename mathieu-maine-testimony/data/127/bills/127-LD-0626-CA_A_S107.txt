15 method of detennining and counting write-in votes according to this subsection. Once a 
16 municipality has voted to accept the option under this subsection, the option applies to all

23 paragraph C and Title 21-A, section 722-A. Votes for a write-in candidate are

26 votes for write-in candidates who have not filed a declaration of write-in candidacy

22 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 219, L.D. 626 
(1) The printed ballot does not include a properly nominated candidate for the 
office; 
(2) A properly nominated candidate for the office listed on the ballot withdraws 
from the race before or on election day; or 
(3) The number of write-in votes for an office as determined by a machine count 
or initial hand count exceeds the number of votes in that count for a candidate 
printed on the ballot. 
Votes for write-in candidates may be counted even if none of the criteria listed in 
subparagraphs (1) to (3) are met in a municipality that has not voted to be governed 
by Title 21-A, section 696, subsection 2, paragraph C and Title 21-A, section 722.,A. 
Nothing in this subsection requires a municipal clerk to count or tally write-in votes for a 
fictitious person, a deceased person or a person from outside the municipality when 
residency is a qualification of office or who is otherwise not qualified to be a candidate 
for the office for which the person is a write-in candidate.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. It provides a local option for municipalities to 
accept the provisions of state election law governing votes for write-in candidates for 
their municipal elections of candidates by secret ballot. The amendment also provides 
that a municipality must count votes for write-in candidates only under certain 
circumstances, such as when there is no properly nominated candidate or when a properly 
nominated candidate whose name is listed on the ballot withdraws from the race on or 
before election day.
