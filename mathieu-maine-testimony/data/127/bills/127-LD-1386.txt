to students who accumulate at least 20 academic credits documenting the successful 21 
completion of courses and demonstrate proficiency in meeting state standards in at least 2 22 
content areas of the system of learning results es tablished under the Maine Revised 23

may award an endorsement of content area proficiency to a student who has demonstrated 25 
proficiency in a content area of the syst em of learning results.  This bill accomplishes the 26 
following.  27 
1.  It amends the basic school approval standards that guide curriculum and 28 
instruction and promote student advancement and graduation to include language for 29 
transitioning to the blended syste m.  Specifically, it provides that a school administrative 30 
unit's comprehensive education plan must include a plan for transitioning to the blended 31 
system.  32 
2.  It provides that, beginning in the 2016 -2017 school year, diplomas must be 33 
awarded to students w ho meet the new curriculum and instructional requirements 34 
established for secondary schools and school boards must adopt policies to phase in these 35 
new requirements.  36 
3.  It strikes the provision that would repeal, on July 1, 2020, the standards for 37 
awardin g high school diplomas to secondary school students who successfully complete 38 
courses required for graduation in accordance with Title 20 -A, section 4722, thus 39 
providing that these standards will continue to apply as part of the blended system.  40 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR0745(01) -1 
 4.  It remo ves the requirement that a diploma indicating graduation from a secondary 1 
school on or after January 1, 2017 must be based on student demonstration of proficiency 2 
in all content areas established under the system of learning results and instead provides 3 
that a diploma indicating graduation must be based on student demonstration of 4 
proficiency in at least 2 content areas established under the system of learning results.  5 
5.  It provides that an endorsement of content area proficiency must be included in a 6 
student's academic transcript as an official credential of academic achievement of content 7 
area proficiency.  8 
6.  It directs the Department of Education to adopt or amend rules pursuant to Title 9 
20-A, section 253, subsection 9 by December 31, 2015 in order to implement the new 10 
blended system beginning with the 2016 -2017 school year.  11
