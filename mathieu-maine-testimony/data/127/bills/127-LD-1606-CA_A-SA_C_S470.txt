general assistance program as long as the reimbursement for that fiscal year does not 
exceed an amount equal to 40% of the adjusted direct costs of that municipality's or 
Indian tribe's average adjusted direct costs for the prior 6 fiscal years. When 
reimbursement under this subsection to a municipality or Indian tribe in a fiscal year

direct costs for the prior 6 fiscal years, for the remainder of that fiscal year, the 
department shall reimburse that municipality or Indian tribe 10% of the municipality's or 
Indian tribe's direct costs of its general assistance program. 
For purposes of this subsection, "adjusted direct costs" means the direct costs of the 
general assistance program of a municipality or Indian tribe, plus an amount that is equal 
to that municipality's or Indian tribe's annual unemployment rate, expressed as a
