This legislation proposes to remove the requirement for a concealed handgun permit except in the cases of reciprocity. 
It increases the concealed handgun permit fees and establishes the Chief of the State Police as the only issuing 
authority. This would result in a loss of General Fund revenue of $5 5,825 in fiscal year 2016-17 and a loss of Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Department of Public Safety of$45,000 in fiscal year 2016-17. The bill 
includes a General Fund appropriation of $260,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to create and maintain a centralized 
database of concealed handgun permit holders and applicants.
