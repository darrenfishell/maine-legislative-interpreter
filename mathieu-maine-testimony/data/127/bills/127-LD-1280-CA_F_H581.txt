SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and is a minority report of the committee. The 
amendment establishes a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino 
in either York County or Cumberland County. The amendment establishes the Casino 
Development Commission, which is an independent board of 5 members appointed by 
the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Department of 
Public Safety, Gambling Control Board for a casino operator license. The fee to submit a 
bid is $250,000. The amendment provides for specific supporting information to be 
submitted by the bidder and considered by the commission including the bidder's ability 
to make a minimum $250,000,000 capital investment in the resort-style casino and 
information regarding job creation, economic development and plans to mitigate negative 
infrastructure impacts. Under the amendment, the commission is directed to develop a 
point system for the factors to be considered and give priority to factors that create jobs, 
promote economic development, increase tourism and support a casino that fits the 
character of the State, with job creation and economic development being the highest 
priorities. The winning bidder must enter into a contract with the commission that 
obligates the casino operator to abide by the proposals made in the winning bid. The 
contract includes a commitment of the casino operator to make annual reinvestments in

the facility of an amount no less than 3% but no greater than 4% of net gambling revenue. 
Failure to abide by the terms of the contract could result in financial penalties to the 
operator. 
The license fee for a casino under the amendment is $10,000,000, which is deposited 
into the General Fund. The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine revenue 
at 35% and the distribution of net table game revenue at 16% for the resort-style casino. 
Upon operation of slot machines at the resort-style casino, the board will hold 
distributions required of existing casinos until the Legislature establishes a single 
distribution structure that would apply to all casinos in the State that establishes a 
distribution of35% of net slot machine revenue and 16% of net table game revenue. 
Finally, the amendment makes enactment of this bill contingent upon the approval of 
the voters of the State at a statewide referendum election.

The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $107 ,250 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for a casino to a single 
applicant. Bidders will pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The Gambling Control Board 
will accept an application for a casino license in either York County or Cumberland County from the winning bidder 
as long as the voters of the State and the voters of the municipality where the casino will be located vote to approve. 
Only one casino, in either York or Cumberland County, may be licensed. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 35% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill requires 
a casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make annual capital improvements to 
the casino using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine income and net table game income or direct those funds to the 
Gambling Control Board. This fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the Gambling Control 
Board. This fiscal note assumes a total of 1,000 slot machines and 24 table games, generating an estimated annual 
Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) revenue of $25,498,980. 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license will 
generate $10,000,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator renewal fee will generate $250,000 in OSRF 
revenue every five years. $126,400 in annual OSRF revenue will be generated from registration fees on slot machines 
and table games. Annual state costs associated with 5 inspectors, 1 auditor, 1 detective and 1 office specialist and 
other related expenses are estimated to be $763,705.

WhiteSand Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in revenue to 
Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to open. This fiscal note assumes the same 20% reduction, 
resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of $379 ,070 and OSRF revenue loss of $5,932, 193 wher 
the southern Maine casino becomes operational. An assessment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood 
Casino has not been done at this time. 
Under current law, State revenue from both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino go to various funds, but this bill 
directs all State revenue from these casinos to go to the Gambling Control Board until a distribution of slot machine 
and table game revenue is established in law. This results in an estimated annual General Fund revenue decrease of 
$8,382,405 and an annual OSRF revenue increase of $8,382,405. The bill requires the new distribution to be 35% of 
net slot machine revenue and 16% of net table game revenue for both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino. This 
results in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of $4,498,34 7 and an estimated annual OSRF revenue loss 
of $7,028,385. Due to the recipients of future net slot machine and net table game distributions being unknown at this 
time, there is no current estimate on the amount of net slot machine and net table game revenue that would go to the 
General Fund and OSRF. 
The additional costs to the Office of the Attorney General are expected to be minor.
