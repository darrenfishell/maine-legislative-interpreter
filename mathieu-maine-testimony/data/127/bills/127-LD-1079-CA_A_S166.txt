3 SUMMARY 
4 This amendment removes the section increasing the number of residential care 
5 facility beds from the resolve. It retains the requirement for the Department of Health 
6 and Human Services to review reimbursement levels at residential care facilities but 
7 allows current reviews of continuum of care to be included. Like the resolve, it requires 
8 the department to develop a demonstration project in Washington County with suite-type 
9 settings but clarifies that the project does not apply only to couples. It authorizes the 
10 Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services to report out legislation related 
11 to the demonstration project and the review to the Second Regular Session of the 127th 
12 Legislature. The amendment also changes the title.
