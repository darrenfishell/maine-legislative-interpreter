This amendment strikes and replaces the bill, which is a concept draft, and amends 
the State's solid waste management laws as follows. 
1. It establishes a food recovery hierarchy to be used in conjunction with the State's 
solid waste management hierarchy as a guiding principle in making decisions related to 
solid waste and organic materials management. 
2. It updates the State's recycling goal. Current statute sets a goal of recycling or 
composting 50% of the municipal solid waste tonnage generated each year within the 
State by January 1, 2014. This amendment extends that goal deadline to January 1, 2021. 
3. It repeals the state waste reduction goal, which focused on the reduction of 
municipal solid waste generated in the State, and establishes a state waste disposal 
reduction goal focused instead on the statewide per capita reduction of waste disposed of 
in the State. 
4. It provides that revenues collected through the assessment of statutory solid waste 
fees may be expended by the Department of Environmental Protection to provide grant 
funding in accordance with the Maine Solid Waste Diversion Grant Program, which is 
established by this amendment. The department is directed to annually review current 
revenues in the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund established in the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 38, section 2201, as well as revenue projections for upcoming years, to 
determine whether additional revenues are available in the upcoming year to provide 
grant funding under the grant program and, if funds are available, to designate them for 
use in accordance with the program. 
5. It establishes the Maine Solid Waste Diversion Grant Program to provide grants to 
public and private entities to assist in the development, implementation or improvement 
of programs, projects, initiatives and activities designed to increase the diversion of solid 
waste from disposal in the State. Under the program, priority in the awarding of grants is 
given to municipal and regional association applicants and to applicants seeking to

establish programs, projects, initiatives or activities likely to increase the removal and 
recycling of organic materials from municipal waste streams. 
6. It provides authority for, but does not require, the Department of Environmental 
Protection to adopt rules imposing fees on the disposal or processing of municipal solid 
waste and on the disposal of certain types of wastes. Rules adopted pursuant to this 
authority are major substantive rules and must be consistent with the State's solid waste 
management hierarchy and food recovery hierarchy. Current waste disposal fees under 
Title 38, sections 2203-A and 2204 remain unchanged and will continue to be assessed 
until the department finally adopts rules imposing different waste disposal fees. The 
amendment also makes some technical edits to section 2203-A to remove outdated 
statutory language. 
7. It directs the Department of Environmental Protection to develop, implement and 
administer a food scraps composting pilot program and provides funds to the Department 
of Administrative and Financial Services to establish such a pilot program. The 
Department of Environmental Protection is required to collect data from participating 
entities and by January 15, 2019 submit a report to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over environmental and natural resources matters detailing 
the data collected by each participating entity and any additional findings and including 
any recommendations for legislation to implement permanent food scraps composting 
programs or requirements at the state, regional, municipal or local level or to otherwise 
increase the diversion rate for organic materials in the State. After receiving the report, 
the committee may report out a bill relating to the report to the First Regular Session of 
the 129th Legislature.

The bill establishes the Maine Solid Waste Diversion Grant Program for the purpose of providing grants to entities 
increasing the diversion of solid waste from disposal in the State. DEP is required to provide funding from the Maine 
Solid Waste Management Fund for these grants if it determines there are sufficient balances within the fund to make 
disbursements. There is no estimate on the amount of grants that will be disbursed to eligible entities. The bill also 
allows DEP to conduct rulemaking to change fees related to certain solid waste disposal, resulting in an estimated 
potential increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund. This bill 
also requires DEP to establish a food scraps composting pilot program with costs expected to be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources. 
This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $40,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 for the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services to establish a food waste composting pilot program. Any additional costs to the 
Legislature to participate in the pilot program are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
