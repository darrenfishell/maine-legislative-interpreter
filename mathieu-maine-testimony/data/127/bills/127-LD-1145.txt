SUMMARY  12 
This bill is based on certain recommendations in the report "Recommendations for 13

hospitalization by:  16

person being involuntarily held or detained if the person's condition poses a serious, 18 
imminent risk to the person's physical or mental health and other conditions are met;  19 
2.  Specifying that family members may be the source of history and information that 20 
forms the basis of an opinion of a medical practitioner regarding a person for whom an 21 
emergency application for admittance to a psychiatric hospital has been filed;  22 
3.  Creating exceptions to the 24 -hour hospital emergency hold period to authorize a 23 
hospital to involuntarily detain a mentally ill person meeting certain cr iteria for 24 
emergency psychiatric hospitalization for 2 additional 48 -hour periods;  25 
4.  Limiting the State's costs related to transporting certain patients to reasonable 26 
costs;  27 
5.  Allowing for the discharge of an involuntary petition if the patient subsequ ently 28 
agrees to voluntary commitment;  29 
6.  Clarifying that orders of involuntary commitment and treatment also transfer with 30 
a patient that is transferred from one hospital to another; and  31 
7.  Permitting medical examinations and consultations required or pe rmitted under 32 
involuntary hospitalization laws to be conducted using telemedicine technologies.  33
