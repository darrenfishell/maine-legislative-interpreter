SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report, strikes the bill and replaces it with 
changes to current law concerning sport shooting ranges. It does the following. 
1. It expands sport shooting range immunity from nuisance lawsuits filed against the 
shooting range from nuisance lawsuits based on noise to any nuisance lawsuit. 
2. It prohibits municipal ordinances from being applied to limit or eliminate shooting 
activities that have occurred on a regular basis at a sport shooting range prior to the 
enactment date of the ordinance. Current law exempts the applicability of ordinances 
only with regard to noise control. 
3. It requires a sport shooting range to meet general gun safety and shooting range 
operation practices or be constructed in a manner not reasonably expected to allow a 
projectile to cross the boundary of the range in order to be exempted from municipal 
ordinances applied to limit or eliminate its current shooting activities. 
4. It provides that a municipality may not restrict a sport shooting range established 
prior to September 1, 2016 from performing maintenance or making improvements to 
enhance public safety and shot containment, provide access for persons with disabilities 
and provide rest room facilities. Other maintenance or improvements must be done in 
compliance with generally applicable municipal building codes and zoning ordinances.
