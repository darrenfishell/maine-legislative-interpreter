SUMMARY  29 
This bill  creates a gun violence restraining order to authorize a court to order a person 30 
to surrender that person's firearms and ammunition for a specific period of time when it 31 
has been proved that the person poses a danger of causing personal injury to that pers on 32

must be returned to the person at the expiration of the gun violence restraining order; and  14 
5.  A person w ho possesses firearms or ammunition in violation of a gun violence 15 
restraining order commits a Class D crime.  Part of the sentence must include the 16
