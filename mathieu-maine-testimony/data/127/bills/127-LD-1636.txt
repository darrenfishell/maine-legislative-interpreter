SUMMARY  6 
This bill makes the following changes to the law regarding the incidental take of an 7 
endangered or threatened spec ies. 8 
1.  It authorizes the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to create a 9 
widespread activity incidental take plan when the commissioner determines that the 10

long as:  12 
A.  The activity poses a manageable risk of taking an endangered or threatened 13 
species;  14 
B.  Any taking would be incidental to an otherwise lawful activity; and  15 
C.  The taking will not impair the recovery of any endangered or threatened species.  16 
2.  It authorizes the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to adopt rules to 17 
provide a broad activity exemption for the taking of an endangered or threatened species 18 
if the exemption:  19 
A.  Addresses a specific activity that is widespread in its oc currence and participation 20 
but may not have a reasonably identifiable group of participants;  21 
B.  Poses little or no risk for an incidental take of an endangered or threatened 22 
species; and  23 
C.  Will not individually or cumulatively impair the recovery of any  endangered or 24 
threatened species.  25 
3.  It requires the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to hold at least one 26 
public hearing on a proposed widespread incidental take plan or a proposed broad activity 27 
exemption and to seek input from knowledgeab le individuals or groups on each proposal.  28 
4.  It repeals and reallocates provisions of existing statute regarding endangered and 29 
threatened species for purposes of clarity and readability.  30
