Under current law the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is allowed to require certain utilities to provide funding for 
electric conservation and efficiency programs administered by the Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT). The maximum 
amount that may be included in rates is 4% of transmission and distribution sales. This bill will change the maximum 
amount that may be included in rates to 4% oftotal retail electricity and transmission and distribution sales. The 
current cap is estimated to have allowed a maximum of $25,000,000 annually be collected and passed to the EMT and 
the PUC has already granted a rate increase of$18,500,000 for fiscal year 2015-16. The proposed cap in this bill is an 
estimated $59,000,000.
