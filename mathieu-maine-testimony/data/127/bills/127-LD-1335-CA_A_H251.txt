Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes the provision in the bill that requires nomination by primary 
election for State Senate, State House of Representatives and county offices only when 
the party nomination is contested. In its place, the amendment provides that, when an 
elected office has no candidate nominated by petition or a declared write-in candidate, the 
office is not required to be printed on the primary ballot. The bill requires that 
withdrawal of a candidate for a primary or general election would have to be for good 
cause, defined by the bill, and by a prescribed deadline in order to have the candidate's 
name removed from the ballot and a replacement candidate nominated. The amendment 
removes the good cause provision but maintains the earlier deadline of 75 days before the 
election, which is an increase from the 60-day deadline in current law. The bill provides 
that a municipal clerk may be subject to a civil violation of $50 per day for each day 
beyond the required date that election returns are not submitted to the Secretary of State. 
The amendment applies that civil penalty to the municipality. The amendment retains the 
provision in the bill that clarifies that a candidate may withdraw after the withdrawal 
deadline if the candidate is incapacitated by a catastrophic condition or injury; however, 
the amendment requires a withdrawal request to be accompanied by a certificate signed 
by a licensed physician instead of at least 2 physicians.
