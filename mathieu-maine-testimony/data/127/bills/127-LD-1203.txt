2.  Municipal authority.  In accordance with this section, the municipal officers may 11 
regulate the care, maintenance and security of prop erty determined to be abandoned 12

14, section 6026 -A or address dangerous proper ties under Title 17, chapter 91, subchapter 15 
4.  Municipal action under this section may not be interpreted to bestow any 16

responsibilities for abandoned properties.  23 
B.  The ordinance may provide that the municipal officers or their designee may take 24 
action to remedy property defects at an abandoned property if the responsible parties 25 
fail to address the property defects  after notice and an opportunity to comply and that 26 
the municipality may recover its costs from the responsible parties.  27 
4.  Notice of foreclosure; designation of representative.  When initiating a 28 
foreclosure action on a property, a foreclosing mortgagee shall notify the municipality 29 
where the property is situated and designate an in -state representative responsible for the 30 
property.  This notification and designation requirement applies regardless of whether the 31 
municipality has adopted an ordinance pursu ant to this section.  32 
5.  Determination of abandonment.  Before a municipality may act under an 33 
ordinance adopted pursuant to this section, either a court or the municipal officers must 34 
have determined that the property has been abandoned according to the e vidence of 35 
abandonment described in Title 14, section 6326.  36 
A.  The municipal officers shall provide notice to the responsible parties and hold a 37 
hearing before making a determination that a property has been abandoned.  The 38 
notice of hearing must:  39 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0422(01) -1 
 (1)  St ate the scheduled date, time and location of the hearing; and  1 
(2)  Inform the responsible parties that, upon a finding of abandonment, the 2 
municipality may require the responsible parties to correct any property defects 3 
within 30 days of issuing a notice t o correct.  4 
B.  A hearing under paragraph A may be held no less than 7 days after receipt or 5 
publication of the notice.  6 
C.  An order issued by the municipality determining that a property is abandoned may 7 
be combined with the notice to correct set forth in subsection 6.  8 
6.  Notice to correct.  If the municipal officers or their designee determines that the 9 
responsible parties have violated an ordinance adopted pursuant to this section by failing 10 
to remedy property defects at an abandoned property, the munici pal officers or their 11 
designee may give written notice to the responsible parties to correct the property defects. 12 
The municipal notice to correct under this section must:  13 
A.  Identify the property defects;  14 
B.  State the municipality's intention to take ap propriate preventive or corrective 15 
measures to address the property defects;  16 
C.  State those measures that the municipality will take if the responsible parties have 17 
not remedied the property defects identified within 30 days of the notice to correct;  18 
D.  State the municipality's intention to subsequently recover the municipality's 19 
direct, legal and administrative costs from the responsible parties; and  20 
E.  Inform the responsible parties of their ability to avert the municipality's actions by 21 
remedying the property defects as identified in the notice.  22 
7.  Notice process.  A notice required to be given under this section is governed by 23 
the following.  24 
A.  Notice must be hand -delivered or mailed by certified mail, return receipt 25 
requested, to the responsible pa rties. Notice is sufficient if the signed receipt is 26 
returned or the certified mail is returned as refused by the recipient.  27 
B.  If the address of the responsible parties cannot be determined with reasonable 28 
diligence, the notice is sufficient if it is pub lished twice consecutively in a daily or 29 
weekly newspaper having general circulation in the municipality in which the 30 
property is located.  31 
8.  In-state representatives.  A responsible party that has been served with notice to 32 
correct pursuant to subsection  6 shall designate a representative whose place of business 33 
is within this State to be responsible for addressing property defects at the property.  The 34 
responsible party shall provide the municipality where the property is located with the 35 
contact informa tion for the responsible party's in -state representative.  Failure to provide 36 
the municipality with the contact information of an in -state representative within 14 days 37 
of receipt of a notice to correct creates a rebuttable presumption that the responsible  party 38 
does not intend to address property defects.  For the purposes of this subsection, "contact 39 
information" means both a mailing address and a direct telephone number with a 40 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR0422(01) -1 
 functioning voice mailbox, as well as the responsible party's direct e -mail ad dress when 1 
available.  2 
9.  Fine.  Not less than 30 days following receipt or publication of the municipal 3 
notice to correct pursuant to subsection 7, the municipality is authorized to assess a fine 4 
of $2,000 for each day the responsible parties have failed to remedy the property defects 5 
identified in the notice to correct.  6 
10.  Costs.  All responsible parties are jointly and severally liable to a municipality 7 
for its direct, legal and administrative costs incurred while remedying or attempting to 8 
remedy the property defects pursuant to an ordinance adopted in accordance with this 9 
section.  The responsible parties shall reimburse the municipality for its costs within 30 10 
days after demand, or a special tax may be assessed against the property in the amount of 11 
those costs and may be collected in the same manner as other state, county and municipal 12 
taxes are collected.  13 
11.  Appeals.  An appeal from a finding of abandonment by the municipal officers 14 
pursuant to this section is to the Superior Court, pursuant to the  provisions of the Maine 15 
Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80B.  16 
SUMMARY  17 
This bill authorizes municipalities, through the adoption of an appropriate ordinance, 18 
to provide for the care, maintenance and security of abandoned properties.  19
