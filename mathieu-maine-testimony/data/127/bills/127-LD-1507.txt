SUMMARY  28 
Current law requires the Secretary of St ate to suspend the driver's license of a person 29 
who violates a court order of financial support upon certification of that violation by the 30 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services.  A person may request the commissioner 31 
issue a conditional release to the  Secretary of State, who may provide the person with a 32 
temporary license valid for a period not to exceed 120 days.  33 
This bill allows a person to request a work -restricted license, similar to that issued 34 
when a person has been convicted of operating under t he influence, to allow the person to 35 
operate a motor vehicle between the person's residence and a place of employment or in 36 
the scope of employment, or both.  The work -restricted license may be issued only if 37 
there is no other means of transportation avail able to the person and the person's license 38

 to operate has not been suspended for operating under the influence within the prior 10 - 1 
year period.  2
