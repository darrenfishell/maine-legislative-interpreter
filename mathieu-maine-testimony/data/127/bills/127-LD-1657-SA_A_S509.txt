expanded the educational opportunity tax credit to include consolidated loans for tax years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2016. The amendment provides that consolidated loans are eligible in tax year 2015 provided that the 
consolidated loans only include educational loans. The incremental effect of adding LD 1505 is to reduce General

2016-17.
