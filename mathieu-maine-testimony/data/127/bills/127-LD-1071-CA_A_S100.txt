14 SUMMARY 
15 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment retains the 
16 provisions of the bill that make restitution mandatory in criminal cases invulving 
17 interference with a cemetery or burial ground and illegal possession of gravestones. The 
18 amendment strikes from the bill the provision that removes from the consideration of the 
19 court the inability to pay of a person who commits these crimes. The amendment strikes 
20 from the bill the strict liability crime of removal of a flower, flag, flag holder or memorial 
21 token from a grave, tomb, monument or burial lot and the crime of owning or controlling 
22 an animal that destroys, mutilates, defaces, injures or removes any tomb, monument, 
23 gravestone, marker, metal plaque, flag, flag holder or veteran's grave marker or other 
24 structure or thing placed or designed as a memorial or to protect a memorial for the dead, 
25 or any portion or fragment of any such memorial, or any fence, railing, curb or other 
26 enclosure for the burial of the dead. The amendment maintains the designation in current 
27 law of interference with a cemetery or burial ground as a Class D crime. The amendment 
28 requires municipalities to repair and restore tombs, monuments, gravestones, markers and 
29 any fences, railings, curbs or other enclosures that have been damaged and for which 
30 repair and restoration have not been provided by a person or organization.
