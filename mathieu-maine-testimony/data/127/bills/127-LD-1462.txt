license to sell the manufacturer's products as well as other liquor on the premises of that 33 
manufacturer.  34

consumption off the premises of that manufacturer without the licensed premises being 36 
physically separated for on -premises and off -premises sales and without physically 37 
separating the inventory, as long as adequate records are m aintained.  This bill also 38 
allows breweries, small breweries, wineries, small wineries, distilleries or small 39

and sell or serve those transferred products.  2
