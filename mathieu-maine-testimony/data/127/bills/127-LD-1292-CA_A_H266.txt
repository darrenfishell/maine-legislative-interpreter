4-A. Exception for super cribbage tournament. Notwithstanding any provision of 
this section to the contrary, the Chief of the State Police may issue up to 3 licenses per 
year for the conduct of a super cribbage tournament. For the purposes of this subsection, 
"cribbage" means a card game that uses a board and pegs to keep score and of which the 
characteristic feature is a crib into which players discard cards from their dealt hand to 
create a crib of 4 cards unseen by other players that will be ultimately part of the dealer's 
hand. The license fee for a super cribbage tournament is $75. A super cribbage 
tournament must be conducted in the same manner as prescribed for a tournament game 
by this section except as follows. 
A. The super cribbage tournament may be conducted by a nationally chartered 
organization that organizes tournament-style cribbage games and that is exempt from 
taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code, Section 501(c)(3) so long as 
the principal organizer has been a member of that organization for a period of not less 
than 3 years. 
B. The minimum number of players required is 50. 
C. The maximum entry fee allowed is $100 per player. 
D. The super cribbage tournament need not be held on premises owned by the 
licensee. 
E. The super cribbage tournament may be conducted over a period of up to 72 hours. 
F. Notwithstanding subsection 2, 50% of the proceeds of the super cribbage 
tournament after prizes are paid must be paid to a bona fide charitable organization, 
other than the licensee, listed on the tournament application submitted to the Chief of 
the State Police.
