SUMMARY  16 
Under current law, the Bo ard of Dental Examiners, Subcommittee on Dental 17 
Hygienists performs an initial review of complaints regarding dental hygienists and 18 
applications and continuing education requirements for dental hygienists.  Following its 19 
review, the subcommittee makes a re commendation to the board and the board acts on the 20 
subcommittee's recommendation.  21 
This bill provides the subcommittee with exclusive jurisdiction over licensing, 22 
continuing education and disciplinary matters regarding dental hygienists, independent 23 
practi ce dental hygienists, dental hygiene therapists, registered dental hygienists and 24 
dental hygienists with public health supervision status and provides the subcommittee 25 
with rule -making authority regarding these matters.  26 
The bill also changes the compositio n of the subcommittee by replacing one of the 27 
dentists with a dental hygienist who is involved in the training and education of dental 28 
hygienists at an accredited school of dental hygiene and removing the requirement that 29 
the existing 2 dental hygienists a re qualified denturists.  30
