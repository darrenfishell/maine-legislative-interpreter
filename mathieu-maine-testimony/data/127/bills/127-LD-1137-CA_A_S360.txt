11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'An Act To Promote Workforce Development' 
13 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
14 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
15 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
16 Whereas, due to Maine's aging population, the State faces a workforce shortage as 
17 an increasing number of workers are retiring and fewer people are available to replace 
18 them; and 
19 Whereas, more workers need to be trained to meet the needs of Maine businesses 
20 with a skilled labor force; and 
21 Whereas, the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program is one of the Department of 
22 Labor's job training programs specifically created to train workers for jobs in high-
23 demand, high-wage careers with a dedicated source of funding; and 
24 Whereas, the Department of Labor is limited in the amount of funding it can use to 
25 train eligible workers because of an annual cap on administration costs and the immediate 
26 removal of that cap would allow the department to provide more training to individuals 
27 within the current calendar year; and 
28 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
29 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
30 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
31 therefore, 
32 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

This legislation removes the cap on the amount of funds in the Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund within the

the Department can provide to individuals qualified under the Competitive Skills Scholarship Program. The 
Department has requested, and this bill includes, Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund allocations of $7 4,328 in fiscal 
year 2015-16 and $149,062 in fiscal year 2016-17 for 2 limited-period CareerCenter Consultant positions and related 
All Other costs to support the additional career counseling and job training efforts. Sufficient funds exist within the 
Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund to support the costs of the 2 positions over the current biennium without 
requiring an increase in the contribution rate applied to employers' taxable payroll.
