This bill will increase costs to the State Employee Health Plan due to the change in the maximum allowable costs list 
rules for pharmacy benefits managers for contracts beginning on or after September 1, 2016. The bill would not have 
any impact on the current biennial budget since the State's Contract with a pharmacy benefits manager ends on June 
30, 2017. Moving forward it is estimated that there will be an annual cost of$97,155 to the General Fund and $3,244 
to the Highway Fund for contributions to the costs of the State Employee Health Plan.
