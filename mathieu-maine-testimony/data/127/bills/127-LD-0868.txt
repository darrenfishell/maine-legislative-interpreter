 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  25 MRSA §2001 -A, sub -§2, ¶F, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 2 
691, Pt. A, §24, is repealed and the following enacted in its place:  3 
F.  A handgun carried by a person to whom a val id permit to carry a concealed 4 
handgun has been issued by that person's state of residence if that person's state of 5 
residence honors a permit to carry a concealed handgun issued under this chapter;  6 
Sec. 2.  25 MRSA §2003, sub -§11, as amended by PL 2011, c . 298, §7, is further 7 
amended to read:  8 
11.  Permit to be in permit holder's immediate possession.   Every permit holder , 9 
including a nonresident who holds a permit issued by the nonresident's state of residence,  10 
shall have the holder's permit in the holder' s immediate possession at all times when 11 
carrying a concealed handgun and shall display the same on demand of any law 12 
enforcement officer.  A person charged with violating this subsection may not be 13 
adjudicated as having committed a civil violation if that  person produces in court the 14 
concealed handgun permit that was valid at the time of the issuance of a summons to 15 
court or, if the holder exhibits the permit to a law enforcement officer designated by the 16 
summonsing officer not later than 24 hours before t he time set for the court appearance, a 17 
complaint may not be issued.  18 
SUMMARY  19 
Current law authorizes the Chief of the State Police to grant reciprocity to a permit to 20 
carry a concealed handgun issued from another state if the other state has substantially 21 
equivalent or stricter requirements for the issuance of a permit and the other state 22 
observes the same rules of reciprocity regarding a person issued a permit under Maine 23 
law. 24 
This bill removes the authority of the Chief of the State Police to enter into 25 
reciprocity agreements and eliminates the required equivalency provisions and simply 26 
recognizes a concealed handgun permit issued to a person by that person's state of 27 
residence if that person's state of residence honors a permit to carry a concealed handgun  28 
issued under Maine law.  29
