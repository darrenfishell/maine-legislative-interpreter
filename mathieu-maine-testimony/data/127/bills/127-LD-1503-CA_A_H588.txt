section 6449 to apprentice in the zone in which the island limited-entry zone program is 
located. 
Sec. 3. 12 MRSA §6447, sub-§9 is enacted to read: 
9. Notice. When a meeting of a lobster management policy council includes as an 
agenda item a proposal that, if adopted, would affect the ability of a person who does not

industry, including but not limited to a proposal regarding exit ratios under section 6448, 
the agenda must be posted publicly at least 7 days in advance of the meeting. 
Sec. 4. 12 MRSA §6448, sub-§2, 1A-1, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 239, §2, is 
amended to read: 
A-1. A lobster management policy council may recommend to the commissioner 
whether the exit ratio adopted for a lobster management zone should be applied to the 
number of licenses that are not renewed or to the number of trap tags associated with 
the licenses that are not renewed. A lobster management policy council may 
recommend that an exit ratio applied to the number of trap tags associated with 
licenses that are not renewed that meets the requirements of paragraph C be applied 
retroactively to a licensing year in which the exit ratio in that zone was based upon 
the number of trap tags retired. The lobster management policy council is not 
required to submit the recommendation to referendum. 
Sec. 5. 12 MRSA §6448, sub-§2, 1C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 239, §2, is

(1) The number of trap tags retired by individuals who declared that zone as their 
declared lobster zone in the year prior to the previous calendar year, but who did 
not declare that zone as their declared lobster zone in the previous calendar year, 
and the number of trap tags issued to new zone entrants authorized under 
subsection 7-A; or 
(2) The number of individuals who declared that zone as their declared lobster 
zone in the year prior to the previous calendar year, but who did not declare that 
zone as their declared lobster zone in the previous calendar year, and the number 
of new zone entrants authorized under subsection 7-A. 
The number of trap tags retired under subparagraph ( 1) must be considered to be the

commissioner shall consult with the lobster management policy council for the lobster

SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. 
This amendment provides that a person who is under 23 years of age is eligible for a 
student lobster and crab fishing license if the person is attending school in accordance 
with compulsory attendance requirements or is enrolled in and meeting the requirements 
of at least a half-time course of study at an accredited postsecondary institution. 
This amendment provides that a person who is under 20 years of age, has completed 
the apprentice program and has received a high school diploma or general equivalency 
diploma may be issued a lobster and crab fishing license that identifies a limited-entry 
zone as the declared lobster zone. This amendment provides that a person who is under 
23 years of age, has completed the apprentice program, is enrolled in and meeting the 
requirements of at least a half-time course of study at an accredited postsecondary 
institution and has been eligible for a student lobster and crab fishing license 
continuously since before the person attained 18 years of age may be issued a lobster and 
crab fishing license that identifies a limited-entry zone as the declared lobster zone. 
This amendment, like the bill, provides that an apprentice program may not require a 
person registered to enter an established island limited-entry zone program to apprentice 
in the zone in which the island limited-entry zone program is located. This amendment, 
like the bill, reduces the support required in a referendum of island residents to establish 
an island limited-entry zone program from 2/3 of lobster and crab fishing license holders 
to a majority oflicense holders.

29 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1026, L.D. 1503 
This amendment requires that, when calculating the number of trap tags retired for 
purposes of applying an exit ratio, the number of trap tags retired is considered to be the 
total of the greatest number of trap tags purchased in any prior year under each license 
that is not renewed, up to the zone maximum. This amendment allows a lobster 
management policy council to recommend that an exit ratio be based upon licenses that 
are not renewed or upon retired trap tags and, if the ratio is based upon retired trap tags, 
whether the exit ratio should be applied retroactively to a specific date. 
This amendment provides that a lobster management policy council must post an 
agenda publicly at least 7 days prior to the council meeting if the agenda includes items 
that would affect the ability of people who do not hold lobster and crab fishing licenses to 
participate in the lobster and crab fishing industry. 
This amendment requires the Commissioner of Marine Resources to maintain, for 
persons who have requested to declare a limited-entry zone as their declared lobster zone, 
a waiting list of persons who did not hold a lobster and crab fishing license in the prior 
year and a separate waiting list of persons who did hold a lobster and crab fishing license 
in the prior year. The commissioner must adopt rules to administer entry of persons who 
held a license in the prior year into limited-entry zones. 
This amendment requires the Commissioner of Marine Resources to verify at least 
every 3 years the waiting lists of persons wishing to enter a limited-entry zone. A person 
who does not respond to a verification request within 90 days is removed from the 
waiting list. This amendment provides the commissioner with the authority to place a 
person who does not respond back on a waiting list in the position where the person 
would have otherwise been when the person shows that the lack of response was due to 
being on active duty with the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard. 
This amendment changes the date by which the Commissioner of Marine Resources ._, 
must determine the number of new zone entrants in each limited-entry zone from 
February 1st to April 1st.
