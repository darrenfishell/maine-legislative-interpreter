This bill includes General Fund deappropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $3,112,981 
beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 to the General Assistance -Reimbursement to Cities and Towns program associated 
with the change in eligiblity for a person who has been detelmined ineligible to receive benefits administered by the 
Department of Health and Human Services on the basis of a law, rule or regulation related to that person's 
immigration status now also being ineligible to receive municipal general assistance program benefits. The 
department had already stopped making this type of General Assistance payment on June 15th, 2014 based on a 
federal law (Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996) which made not qualified 
immigrants ineligible for state and local public benefit programs. However, there was never a baseline reduction to the 
appropriation for this change in June of 20 14, and the deappropriations in this bill will fully book the savings.
