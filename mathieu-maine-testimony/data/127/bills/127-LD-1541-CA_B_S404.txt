22 paragraph A will result in substantial injustice to the defendant. In making

24 whether the defendant did not know and reasonably should not have known

27 paragraph A will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and

31 or 1118-A; and 
32 (2) The court finds that: 
33 (c) The defendant's background, attitude and prospects for rehabilitation and 
34 the nature of the victim and the offense indicate that imposition of a sentence 
35 under paragraph A would frustrate the general purposes of sentencing set 
36 forth in section 1151.

If the court imposes a sentence under this paragraph, the court shall state in writing 
its reasons for its findings and for imposing a sentence under this paragraph rather 
than under paragraph A; and 
C. If the court imposes a sentence under paragraph B, the minimum sentence of 
imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows: When the sentencing class 
is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 9 months; when the sentencing is 
Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 6 months; and, with the exception of 
trafficking or furnishing marijuana under section 1105-A or 1105-C, when the 
sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of imprisonment is 3 months.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment raises the 
class of crime for the illegal importation of scheduled drugs for a schedule W drug from a 
Class C crime to a Class B crime if the drug is fentanyl powder or the drug is heroin and 
at the time of the offense the person illegally imports 6 grams or more of heroin or 270 or 
more individual bags, folds, packages, envelopes or containers of any kind containing 
heroin. 
Like the bill, this amendment creates the crime of aggravated illegal importation of a 
scheduled drug; however, the amendment limits the scheduled drugs that may give rise to 
the crime to fentanyl powder and certain amounts of heroin. The aggravating factors 
include a prior drug conviction, using a firearm while committing the offense, having a 
child under 18 years of age assist with the illegal importation and when death is in fact 
caused by the use of the scheduled drug. 
The amendment adds aggravated illegal importation of a scheduled drug to the crimes 
that may result, under certain circumstances, in the forfeiture of firearms. 
The amendment specifies that the minimum sentence of imprisonment is 4 years for a 
violation of the law prohibiting aggravated illegal importation of a scheduled drug.
