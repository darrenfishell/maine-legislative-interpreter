 Page 2 - 127LR0978( 01)-1 
 1.  Determination.  A property ow ner is entitled to a determination by the fact finder 1 
as to whether a regulatory taking has occurred upon the submission of prima facie 2 
evidence, supported by a professional appraisal, of a diminution in the fair market value 3 
of real property of 50% or gre ater caused by regulation.  4 
2.  Factors to be weighed.  After a prima facie showing has been made under 5 
subsection 1, in determining whether a regulatory taking has in fact occurred, the fact 6 
finder shall weigh 3 factors:  7 
A.  The extent of the diminution in  fair market value of the real property caused by 8

caused by a regulation must be measured by the diminution of the fair market value of the 22

 §856.  Relief  1 
Damages are availabl e as relief for a regulatory taking.  The fact finder shall award 2 
the property owner an amount it determines comprises the diminution in fair market value 3 
caused by regulation, and title in the real property remains with the property owner. 4 
Payment of dama ges pursuant to this section operates to grant to and vest in the State the 5 
right to enforce the regulation as to the real property.  Damages are limited to damages 6 
pursuant to Title 14, section 8105, subsection 1.  7 
§857.  Limitations  8

under section 853 unless commenced within 3 years after the cause of action first accrues.  10 
2.  Accrual.  A cause of action accrues on the date that regulation first limits the use 11 
of the real prop erty that a property owner claims has been subject to a regulatory taking.  12 
3.  Multiple regulations.  If an action under section 853 is based on the cumulative 13 
impact of multiple regulations, each regulation must have been enacted after the effective 14 
date of this chapter.  15 
4.  Tolling.  The limitations period is tolled during the period of mandatory mediation 16 
under section 859 and during the period of any relevant underlying governmental land 17 
use action and appeal thereof pursuant to Title 5, section 11001.  18 
§858.  Municipal mandates  19 
1.  Municipal regulation required by State.  If a state regulation requires a 20 
municipality to enact regulation, the municipality may not be held liable under this 21 
chapter for any regulation it enacts pursuant to that regulation.  Such regulation must 22 
instead be deemed state regulation for which only the State may be held liable.  If the 23 
municipality expressly provides in its enactment of the mandated regulation that it 24 
endorses the regulation, the regulation must be considered muni cipal regulation and not 25 
actionable as state regulation under this chapter.  26 
2.  Municipal immunity.  A municipality is immune from any liability under this 27 
chapter for any application of a regulation, state mandated or otherwise, and may not be 28 
considered a necessary or proper party in any mediation or action under this chapter, 29 
although the municipality may participate in mediation or an action under section 853 to 30 
the degree it chooses.  31 
3.  Appearance costs.  Any party in an action under this chapter who for whatever 32 
reason calls a municipal officer, employee or representative as a witness or deponent, or 33 
otherwise seeks action from the municipality, such as the production of documents, shall 34 
compensate the municipality for its actual costs in responding, as determined by the 35 
court.  36 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR0978( 01)-1 
 §859.  Mandatory mediation  1 
1.  Commencement.  Prior to filing an action pursuant to section 853, a property 2 
owner shall pursue relief under the land use mediation program established under section 3 
831, except as provided in thi s section.  4 
2.  Application.  The application of the property owner for mediation under section 5 
831 must include a professional appraisal indicating a 50% or greater diminution in value 6 
of real property caused by a regulation or regulations enacted after th e effective date of 7 
this chapter.  By applying for mediation, the property owner consents to grant the 8 
mediator and the State reasonable access to the real property with advance notice at a 9 
time and in a manner acceptable to the property owner.  10 
3.  Ripenes s.  Unless the impact of a regulation on the real property clearly and 11 
unequivocally in its terms acts as a 50% diminution in value of the real property, a 12 
property owner must seek a formal denial of a written request for development or 13 
variance in an unde rlying governmental land use action before the property owner may 14 
commence mediation under section 831.  The findings made in such an underlying 15 
governmental land use action are not admissible and have no estoppel effect in an action 16 
pursuant to section 85 3.  The property owner may, but need not, appeal the underlying 17 
governmental action under Title 5, section 11001 in order to make either the application 18 
for mediation or an action pursuant to section 853 ripe, and mediation must be tolled 19 
during the period  any such appeal is pending.  20 
A property owner may seek to mediate and thereafter pursue a claim under section 853 21 
only when a regulation affects a use existing on the real property at the time the 22 
regulation is enacted or a reasonably foreseeable, nonspecu lative use that is suitable for 23 
the subject real property and is compatible with adjacent land uses.  A use is reasonably 24 
foreseeable if there is evidence that the property owner intended in fact to develop that 25 
use or a similar use of similar intensity.  26 
4.  Notice.  All abutters to the property that the property owner claims has been taken, 27 
as well as any participant in any relevant underlying governmental land use action, must 28 
be notified by the property owner of the commencement of mediation under sectio n 831, 29 
subsection 8.  Notice must be made by sending a copy of the mediation application by 30 
United States mail or hand delivery at the address on the latest property tax roll.  31 
5.  Identification of allowed uses; settlement offer.  If the State has not prev iously 32 
identified in any preceding underlying governmental land use action what land uses, if 33 
any, it will permit the owner to carry out on the real property that the property owner 34 
claims has been taken, the State shall do so in the mediation under sectio n 831.  35 
Additionally, the State may present a written settlement offer to:  36 
A.  Swap or exchange real property;  37 
B.  Accept mitigation, including payments in lieu of on -site mitigation;  38 
C.  Accept location of development on the least sensitive portion of the  regulated real 39 
property; or  40 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0978(01) -1 
 D.  Purchase the real property, or an interest in the real property or a portion of the 1 
real property, or pay compensation.  2 
If the State chooses, it may submit in an action under section 853 the list of identified 3 
allowed uses it previously provided the property owner and the content of any settlement 4 
offer previously proposed by the State, and it may ask the fact finder to determine 5 
whether a regulatory taking would be averted by the allowance of such previously 6 
identified uses  or the terms of the settlement offer.  If the jury so finds, the State may, if it 7 
chooses, allow the previously identified uses or terms of the settlement offer in lieu of 8 
damages as relief.  9 
6.  Timing.  The schedule to be followed in the mediation under section 831 must be 10 
set by the mediator, but mediation must be completed no later than one year after the 11 
property owner applies for mediation, unless the State and the property owner agree to an 12 
extension.  13 
7.  Execution of settlement.  A settlement reache d pursuant to mediation under 14 
section 831 must be formalized in writing and self -executing, and sovereign immunity to 15 
enforce a settlement against the State is waived.  16 
8.  Failure to reach settlement.  If a property owner and the State fail to agree to a 17 
settlement during the mandatory mediation process under this section, the property owner 18 
may file an action against the State under section 853.  If during mediation the State 19 
makes a bona fide settlement offer and the owner rejects that offer and proceeds to file a 20 
claim under section 853, the property owner is liable for the costs and fees of the State 21 
from the point in time of rejection of the State's bona fide settlement offer until resolution 22 
of the claim under section 853 as long as the resolution of t he claim under section 853 is 23 
either a finding of no taking or the damages awarded under the claim under section 853 24 
are of a smaller dollar value than that contained in the State's bona fide settlement offer.  25 
9.  Fees.  The cost of the mediation is as set  forth in section 831, supplemented by an 26 
administrative fee to be determined by the judicial branch.  27 
§860.  Attorney's fees and costs  28 
In an action brought under section 853, the prevailing party is, at the discretion of the 29 
court, entitled to reasonable a ttorney's fees and costs.  The court may at its discretion also 30 
award to either party attorney's fees and costs for the mediation under section 831 if it 31 
concludes that the State did not make or the property owner did not accept a bona fide 32 
settlement offe r in the mediation.  33 
Sec. A -2.  Judicial branch report on case load.  The judicial branch shall 34 
compile information regarding the number of cases filed in state courts pursuant to the 35 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 853.  This information must incl ude whether the 36 
cases at issue involve only a cause of action under Title 1, section 853 or whether these 37 
cases involve multiple causes of action, including a cause of action under Title 1, section 38 
853.  The judicial branch shall submit this information to  the joint standing committee of 39 
the Legislature having jurisdiction over judiciary matters no later than February 1, 2017 40 
and every 2 years thereafter.  41

or review requirement.  25

SUMMARY  19 
This bill establishes standards for relief when state regulation imposes an inordinate 20 
burden on a n individual property owner, as well as efficient mechanisms for pursuit of 21 
such relief.  The bill provides that, if a property owner's right to use, divide, sell, occupy 22 
or possess real property is reduced by the enactment or application of a government 23 
regulation, the property owner may seek and obtain relief.  Under the provisions of the 24 
bill, prior to filing an action, the property owner must pursue relief under a land use 25 
mediation program.  26
