 SUMMARY  1 
The purpose of this bi ll is to improve the competitiveness of and ability to attract 2 
private investment at Loring Commerce Centre, which is operated by the Loring 3 
Development Authority of Maine at the former Loring Air Force Base.  The bill increases 4 
the amount of employment ta x increment paid to the Loring Job Increment Financing 5 
Fund from 50% to 100%.  The bill requires the Loring Development Authority of Maine 6 
to provide to the State Tax Assessor by October 31st, rather than September 30th, of each 7 
year certain information re lating to employment in the former Loring Air Force Base 8 
area.  The bill also clarifies, in order to reflect current administrative practice, that it is the 9 
State Controller that administers the employment tax increment contingent account and 10 
that it is th e assessor that pays the employment tax increment amount into the fund.  By 11 
December 1st of each year, the assessor is directed to calculate the amount to be paid to 12 
the fund and pay that amount to the fund by December 31st; current law requires the 13 
Commis sioner of Administrative and Financial Services to make the payment by July 14 
31st of each year.  15
