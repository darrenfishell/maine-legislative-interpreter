'An Act To Ensure That Telephone Utility Reorganizations Advance the 
Information Access Goals of the State' 
Amend the bill in section 2 in paragraph A-I by striking out subparagraphs (1) and 
(2) (page 2, lines 6 to 12 in L.D.) and inserting the following; 
1(1) Must find that the proposal will advance the information access goals of the 
State as set forth in section 7101, subsection 4; 
(2) Must find that the reorganization does not result in changes that would

SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report, removes the requirement that 
economic development goals must be advanced in order for the Public Utilities 
Commission to approve a reorganization involving a telephone utility with gross annual 
state revenues greater than $50,000,000. This amendment also requires a broader finding 
by the commission that the reorganization does not result in changes that would adversely 
affect safety, reliability or quality of service, unlike in the bill, which requires a finding 
that the reorganization would not result in changes that would adversely affect safety, 
reliability or quality of service as it pertains to the location and the accessibility of the 
telephone utili tis management and operations or to the proportion and number of the 
telephone utilitis employees who reside in the State.
