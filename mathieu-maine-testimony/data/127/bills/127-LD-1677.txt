 Preamble. Whereas, the law governing the calculation of member retirement 1 
benefits was amended by Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part CCCC, section 1 and 2 
chapter 385 to allow members of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System who 3 
retired on or after Ju ly 1, 2015 to pay the necessary member contributions to include in 4 
their retirement benefit calculations wages lost due to merit pay freezes and longevity pay 5 
freezes; and  6 
Whereas, equity requires that the law be similarly amended to allow members of the 7 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System who retired prior to July 1, 2015 to pay the 8 
necessary member contributions to include in their retirement benefit calculations wages 9 
lost due to such pay freezes; and  10 
Whereas, in order to rectify the situation, it i s necessary first to determine the 11 
population of retirees who are potentially affected by this inequity, and then to calculate 12 
the costs associated with expanding the universe of retirees who are permitted to elect to 13 
contribute the necessary member contri butions to include in their retirement benefit 14 
calculations wages lost due to such pay freezes; now, therefore, be it  15 
Sec. 1.  Identification of members.  Resolved:  That the Department of 16 
Administrative and Financial Services and the Maine Public Employee s Retirement 17 
System shall work together to identify retirees who retired prior to July 1, 2015 and 18 
whose retirement benefit calculations were adversely affected by merit pay freezes and 19 
longevity pay freezes in effect in fiscal years 2011 -12 and 2012 -13; a nd be it further  20 
Sec. 2.  Calculation of costs.  Resolved:  That the Department of Administrative 21 
and Financial Services and the Maine Public Employees Retirement System shall work 22 
together to calculate the projected costs associated with authorizing membe rs of the 23 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System who retired prior to July 1, 2015 to include 24 
in their retirement benefit calculations wages lost due to merit pay freezes and longevity 25 
pay freezes in effect in fiscal years 2011 -12 and 2012 -13; and be it further  26 
Sec. 3.  Report.  Resolved:  That, no later than November 2, 2016, the Department 27 
of Administrative and Financial Services and the Maine Public Employees Retirement 28 
System shall report their findings pursuant to sections 1 and 2 to the Joint Standi ng 29 
Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs.  The joint standing committee of the 30 
Legislature having jurisdiction over appropriations and financial affairs may report out to 31 
the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature a bill to authorize me mbers of the 32 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System who retired prior to July 1, 2015 to include 33 
in their retirement benefit calculations wages lost due to merit pay freezes and longevity 34 
pay freezes in effect in fiscal years 2011 -12 and 2012 -13. 35
