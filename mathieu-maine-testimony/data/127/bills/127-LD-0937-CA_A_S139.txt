This bill creates a new program account, the Maine Home Repair Program, in the State's financial accounting system 
to accept funds received from the 3% surcharge on the retail sale of certain water filters to be used for the Maine State 
Housing Authority's (MSHA) home repair program. The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of 
$15,400 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $22,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Maine Home Repair Program within MSHA 
based on revenue projections developed by Maine Revenue Services. This fiscal note assumes an effective date of 
October 1,2015. 
The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $12,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 to the Bureau of Revenue 
Services for programming changes to allow retailers to separately report the water filter surcharge. General Fund 
revenues are anticipated to be reduced by $933 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $1,333 in fiscal year 2016-17 for a drop in 
demand of water filters because of the new surcharge. Local Government Funds revenue would be reduced by $49 in 
fiscal year 2015-16 and $70 in fiscal year 2016-17. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt the changes in this bill are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
