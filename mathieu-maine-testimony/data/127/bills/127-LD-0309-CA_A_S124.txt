11 damages to the property owner, as provided in the bill, and granting a takings variance. 
12 Granting a takings variance means that the regulation causing the regulatory taking may 
13 not be applied to the property. 
14 The State may also grant a takings variance as a settlement offer as part of the 
15 mandatory mediation process.
