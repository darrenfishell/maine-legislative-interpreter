This amendment reduces the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by 
$1,187,721 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $2,492,495 in fiscal year 2016-17 to eliminate the provision to incrementally 
adjust the MaineCare reimbursement rates for certain dental services annually over the next 5 years until the rates 
reach the 10th percentile of certain fees and to remove all fiscal year 15-16 appropriations. Federal Expenditures Fund 
allocations required for the FMAP match will also be reduced.
