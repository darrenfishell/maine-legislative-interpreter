Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment strikes a reference to a loan repayment program from the title of the 
chapter of law proposed to be enacted in the bill. The amendment also adds high school 
seniors to the definition of "STEM student." The amendment changes the maximum loan 
term from 4 years to 5 years and strikes a reference to 8% loans being available to 
students who, upon graduation, are not employed in the field of science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics. 
Finally, the amendment adds a contingency funding provision that prohibits the 
Finance Authority of Maine from providing loans through the Maine Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Loan Program in fiscal year 2015-16 unless 
legislation is enacted during the First Regular Session of the 127th Legislature that 
provides additional funding for the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program for 
fiscal year 2015-16 and for the Maine Community College System for fiscal year 2015-
16 and fiscal year 2016-17.

This bill establishes the Maine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Loan Program within the Finance 
Authority of Maine (FAME) and provides a one-time General Fund appropriation of$10,000,000 in fiscal yea~2015-
16 to capitalize a newly created Maine Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Loan Fund within FAME 
to provide loans to students pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in the fields of science, computer science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics. 
This legislation makes the implementation of the loan program contingent upon an additional $40,199,613 being 
appropriated in fiscal year 2015-16 to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program within the Department of 
Education and an additional $2,000,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $4,000,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 being 
appropriated to the Maine Community College System as part ofLD 1019, the 2016-2107 biennial budget. Before 
final enactment in the Senate, this bill will be placed on the Special Appropriations Table to await final legislative 
actions on the budget, when it will be known whether or not the contingency requirements in this bill have been met 
and if this legislation can move forward. 
This legislation also provides that interest earnings from the fund may be used to cover the expenses incurred by 
FAME to administer the program and the fund. FAME has indicated that this provision will allow for sufficient 
resources to cover the administrative costs and no additional General Fund appropriations will be required.
