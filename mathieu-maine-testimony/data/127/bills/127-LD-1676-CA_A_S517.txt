11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'An Act To Establish a Process for the Procurement of Biomass Resources and 
13 Electric Energy from Combined Heat and Power Facilities' 
14 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
15 summary and inserting the following: 
16 'Sec. 1. Biomass competitive solicitation. 
17 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
18 following terms have the following meanings. 
19 A. "Biomass resource" is a source of electrical generation fueled by wood, wood 
20 waste or landfill gas that produces energy that may be physically delivered to the 
21 ISO-NE region, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 1902, 
22 subsection 3, or in the NMISA region. 
23 B. "Commission" means the Public Utilities Commission. 
24 C. "NMISA region" is the area administered by the independent system 
25 administrator for northern Maine or any successor of the independent system 
26 administrator for northern Maine. 
27 2. Solicitation and contract negotiation. In accordance with subsection 3, the 
28 commission shall initiate a competitive solicitation as soon as practicable and direct 
29 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to enter into one or more 2-year 
30 contracts for up to 80 megawatts of biomass resources contingent upon available funds 
31 for above-market costs of the contract pursuant to subsection 4. The contract may be a 
32 contract for energy or a contract for differences. If a generator offers to sell capacity or 
33 renewable energy attributes as part of a contract entered into pursuant to this section, the 
34 contract may include the purchase of such capacity or attributes, but the commission may

not condition any solicitation or contract on an offer or sale of capacity or renewable 
energy attributes. 
3. Review and selection of renewable resources and contract adjustments. In 
conducting a solicitation and entering into any contract under subsection 2, the 
commission shall: 
A. Ensure that a biomass resource facility is operating at 50% capacity 6 months 
prior to the initiation of a competitive solicitation in accordance with subsection 2 
and continues to operate at that capacity except for planned and forced outages; and 
B. Seek to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that a contract entered into under 
this section: 
( 1) Provides benefits to ratepayers; 
(2) Provides in-state benefits, such as capital investments to improve long-term 
viability of the facility, permanent direct jobs, payments to municipalities, 
payments for fuel harvested in the State, payment for in-state resource access, in­
state purchases of goods and services and construction-related jobs and 
purchases; 
(3) Reduces greenhouse gas emissions.; 
( 4) Promotes fuel diversity; and 
(5) Supports or improves grid reliability. 
In selecting among bids, the commission shall determine the total in-state economic 
benefits of the contract in an expected annual dollar per megawatt-hour average and the 
cost to fund the above-market costs of a contract in an expected annual dollar per 
megawatt-hour average. The commission shall consider both of these values for each 
proposal to identify those proposals that maximize the overall benefits to the State, and 
shall establish a process under which a generator of biomass resources verifies on an 
annual basis that the projected in-state economic benefits are generated during the term of 
the contract. If the commission finds the in-state benefits are not being achieved, the 
commission may reduce the contract payment by the percentage difference between 
actual in-state benefits achieved and the projected in-state benefits. 
4. Cost limits. The commission may enter only into contracts under this section that 
are contingent on the availability of funds in the cost recovery fund established under 
subsection 5 to pay the above-market costs of the contract, as determined by the 
commission. Payments of all above-market costs of a contract must be made solely from 
those funds and are not a liability of the transmission and distribution utility, its 
ratepayers or the commission. If insufficient funds are available in the fund to pay above­
market costs under a contract, the commission shall notify the contracting entity and, 
unless the contracting entity and the commission agree otherwise, the contract is 
suspended. The commission and the contracting entity may agree to reinstate a 
suspended contract upon the availability of sufficient funds in the cost recovery fund to 
pay above-market costs. 
5. Cost recovery fund. There is established within the commission a nonlapsing 
cost recovery fund, referred to in this section as "the fund." The fund receives funds 
allocated or transferred by the Legislature from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund in

the commission shall conduct a competitive solicitation in a manner consistent with the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-C to procure this energy. In order for a 
facility to qualify for a contract, it must have a designed operating efficiency ratio of 
useful electric and thermal output to the fuel input of at least 60% and be a new facility or 
a facility that has been refurbished through significant capital investment, as defined by 
the commission. The commission may not direct an investor-owned transmission and 
distribution utility to enter into a contract if the commission finds that the likely costs 
resulting from any contract entered into as a result of the solicitation process will exceed 
the likely benefits to ratepayers. 
1. Rules. The commission may adopt rules to implement this section. Rules adopted 
under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,

The bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to enter into one or more two-year contracts for up to 80 
megawatts of biomass resources, contingent upon available funds for above market costs of the contract. This bill 
creates the Cost Recovery Fund within the PUC and transfers $6, 700,000 in both fiscal year 2016-17 and fiscal year 
2017-18 from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund to the Cost Recovery Fund to pay all above-market costs of the 
contracts. The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation in fiscal year 2016-17 of $6, 700,000 to allow 
the PUC to pay all above-market costs of the contracts and an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $100,974 
for consulting costs. The Maine Budget Stabilization Fund has sufficient resources to make these transfers. The PUC 
will receive an annual $100,974 increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue from increased assessments to 
fund the consulting costs.
