The repeal of the service provider tax will reduce Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the Medical Care -
Payments to Providers program at the Department of Health and Human Services by $8,083,333 in fiscal year 2016-
17. The bill includes a net General Fund appropriation to that program at DHHS of $6,686,027 in fiscal year 2016-17 
to partially offset the lost revenue. The remaining $1,397,306 will no longer be needed because of a reduction in the 
reimbursement rate under MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapters II and III, Section 97, Appendix C private non­
medical institutions. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are reduced for the lower FMAP match.
