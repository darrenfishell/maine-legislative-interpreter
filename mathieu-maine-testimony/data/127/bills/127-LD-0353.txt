 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the high value per pound for elvers in recent years has resulted in 3 
economic benefit for t he State of Maine and Maine's elver fishermen; and  4 
Whereas, the statewide elver quota for the 2014 fishing season was 11,749 pounds; 5 
and 6 
Whereas, Maine elver fishermen harvested only 9,688 pounds of elvers during the 7 
2014 fishing season; and  8 
Whereas, the A tlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission reduced Maine's elver 9 
quota by an amount equivalent to the difference between the elver quota and the amount 10 
actually harvested during the 2014 fishing season; and  11 
Whereas, the Department of Marine Resources must act quickly to ensure Maine 12 
fishermen can fully access Maine's elver resource in future fishing seasons; and  13 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 14 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the follow ing legislation as 15 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 16 
therefore,  17
