This bill expands the Pine Tree Development Zone program to include the Towns of Berwick and Sanford. It is not 
expected that a qualified project would be certified before fiscal year 2017-18, therefore the General Fund and Local 
Government Fund revenue loss does not begin until outside the biennium. 
Additional costs to the Department of Economic and Community Development associated with implementing the 
requirements of this legislation can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
