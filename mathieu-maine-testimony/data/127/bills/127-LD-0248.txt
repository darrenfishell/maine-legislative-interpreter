 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA ยง1303, as amended by PL 1997, c. 757, ยง1, is further amended 2 
to read:  3 
ยง1303.  Public works; minimum wage and benefits  4 
In the employment of laborers in the construction of public  works, including state 5 
highways, by the State or by persons contracting for the construction, preference must 6 
first be given to citizens of the State who are qualified to perform the work to which the 7 
employment relates and, if they can not be obtained in  sufficient numbers, then to citizens 8 
of the United States.  Every contract for public works construction must contain a 9 
provision for employing citizens of this State or the United States.  The hourly wage and 10 
benefit rate paid to laborers employed in the  construction of public works, including state 11 
highways, may not be less than the fair minimum rate as determined in accordance with 12 
section 1308.  A contractor may allot wages and benefits in any proportion, as long as the 13 
sum of the hourly wage and benef it rate paid is not less than the sum of the appropriate 14 
hourly wage and benefit rate, determined in accordance with section 1308, to the extent 15 
that the wage rate is otherwise in compliance with law.   Any contractor who knowingly 16 
and willfully violates th is section is subject to a fine of not less than $250 per employee 17 
violation.  Each day that any contractor employs a laborer at less than the wage and 18 
benefit minimum stipulated in this section constitutes a separate violation of this section.  19 
SUMMARY  20 
This bill allows flexibility in the minimum hourly wage and benefit rates for workers 21 
employed in the construction of public works by the State or persons contracting with the 22 
State by allowing any allocation between hourly wage and benefit rates, as long as the 23 
sum of the hourly wage and benefit rates equals the sum of the appropriate hourly wage 24 
and benefit rates determined by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Standards.  25
