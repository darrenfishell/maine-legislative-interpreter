SUMMARY 
This amendment dOeS the following: 
1. It increases the amount of funding being diverted from the Housing Opportunities 
for Maine Fund to the General Fund by $3,000,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $3,000,000 
in fiscal year 2016-17 and requires that $3,000,000 per year be diverted from the Housing 
Opportunities for Maine Fund to the General Fund beginning in fiscal year 2017-18; and 
2. It provides funding of $3,000,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 to a 
newly created rental assistance program within the Maine State Housing Authority. 
This amendment, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, requires 
payment of a tax equalization assessment if a resident taxpayer has an expanded income 
of at least $250,000 for single filers, $325,000 for head of household filers or $400,000 
for joint filers and an effective tax rate that is less than the average effective tax rate on 
state and local taxes paid by the bottom 98% of income earners. Any excess revenue 
generated by the tax equalization assessment must go to the Maine Budget Stabilization 
Fund.

This amendment eliminates the reduction in salary and benefit costs used to calculate 
a school administrative unit's EPS per-pupil rate by the amount of federal funds received 
under Title I of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The 
disregarding of those federal funds continues if the State fails to provide funding at the 
same or a greater level.
