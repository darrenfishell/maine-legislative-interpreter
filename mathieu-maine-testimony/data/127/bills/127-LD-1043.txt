 SUMMARY  1 
This bill amends the laws regarding the State's contribution to residential overboard 2 
discharge replacement projects.  Under current law, depending on income le vel, an 3 
individual may apply for a grant for reimbursement of all or a portion of the cost of 4 
removing and replacing any overboard discharge, but may be approved for such 5 
reimbursement only after project completion.  This bill allows the Commissioner of 6 
Environmental Protection to approve applications for reimbursement in advance of 7 
construction if certain conditions are met and to dedicate the proposed project expenses 8 
for reimbursement for a specified period of time.  Upon completion of the project and 9 
submission of expense documentation, the commissioner is directed to reimburse the 10 
individual for the previously applied for and approved eligible project expenses.  The bill 11 
also provides an appropriation in fiscal years 2015 -16 and 2016 -17 in the amount of  12 
$200,000 per year to provide grants to reimburse individuals for the cost of removing an 13 
overboard discharge under this program.  14
