following. 
1. It amends the law on sexual exploitation of a minor by changing the applicable 
age of protected minors from under 18 years of age to under 16 years of age, except in 
cases of compulsion. It also provides that the law does not apply with respect to a minor 
who is 14 or 15 years old who is employed, solicited, enticed, persuaded or used to 
engage in sexually explicit conduct by a person who is less than 5 years older than the 
minor, unless the person is the minor's parent or legal guardian or has care or custody of 
the minor. 
2. It amends the law on dissemination of sexually explicit material by changing the 
applicable age of protected persons from under 18 years of age to under 16 years of age. 
It also provides that the law does not apply with respect to a person depicted in such 
material if the person is 14 or 15 years old and the person disseminating the material is 
less than 5 years older than the depicted person. 
3. It amends the law on possession of sexually explicit material to exempt from the 
law possession of material in which the depicted person is 14 or 15 years of age and the 
actor is less than 5 years older than the depicted person. 
4. It amends the law on unauthorized dissemination of certain private images to 
remove the requirement that the depicted person be 18 years of age or older for the law to 
apply.
