1.  Filing.  If Before August 1, 2016, if  any tax imposed by this Title or imposed by 5 
any other provision of law and authorized to be collected by the bureau is not paid when 6 
due and no further administrative or judicial review of the assessment is available 7 
pursuant to law, the assessor may file in the registry of deeds of any county, with respect 8 
to real property, or in the office of the Secretary of State, with respect to property of a 9 
type a security interest in which may be perfected by a filing in such office under Title 10 
11, Article 9 -A, a notice of lien specif ying the amount of the tax, interest, penalty and 11 
costs due, the name and last known address of the person liable for the amount and, in the 12 
case of a tax imposed by this Title, the fact that the assessor has complied with all the 13 
provisions of this Title in the assessment of the tax.  The lien arises at the time the 14 
assessment becomes final and constitutes a lien upon all property, whether real or 15 
personal, then owned or thereafter acquired by that person in the period before the 16 
expiration of the lien.  T he lien imposed by this section is not valid against any 17 
mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, judgment creditor or holder of a properly recorded 18 
security interest until notice of the lien has been filed by the assessor, with respect to real 19 
property, in the regi stry of deeds of the county where such property is located and, with 20 
respect to personal property, in the office in which a financing statement for such 21 
personal property is normally filed.  Notwithstanding this subsection, a tax lien upon 22 
personal propert y does not extend to those types of personal property not subject to 23 
perfection of a security interest by means of the filing in the office of the Secretary of 24 
State.  The lien is prior to any mortgage or security interest recorded, filed or otherwise 25 
perfected after the notice, other than a purchase money security interest perfected in 26 
accordance with Title 11, Article 9 -A.  In the case of any mortgage or security interest 27 
properly recorded or filed prior to the notice of lien that secures future advances by the 28 
mortgagee or secured party, the lien is junior to all advances made within 45 days after 29 
filing of the notice of lien, or made without knowledge of the lien or pursuant to a 30 
commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.  Subject to the limi tations in this 31 
section, the lien provided in this section  subsection  has the same force, effect and priority 32 
as a judgment lien and continues for 10 years from the date of recording unless sooner 33 
released or otherwise discharged.  The lien may, within the  10-year period, or within 10 34 
years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the manner provided in this 35 
subsection, be extended by filing for record in the appropriate office a copy of the notice 36 
and, from the time of filing, that lien must be e xtended for 10 years unless sooner 37 
released or otherwise discharged.  38 
This subsection applies to assessments made before August 1, 2016.  39 
Sec. A -2.  36 MRSA §175 -A, sub -§1-A is enacted to read:  40

 Page 2 - 127LR2748(01) -1 
 bureau is not paid when due and no further administrative or judicial review of the 1 
assessment is available pursuant to law, the amount of the asse ssment, including the tax, 2 
interest, penalties and costs, is a lien in favor of the assessor.  The lien arises at the time 3 
the assessment is made and constitutes a lien upon all property, whether real or personal, 4 
owned by the person liable for the assessm ent at the time the lien arises or acquired by 5 
that person in the period after the lien arises until the expiration of the lien.  The assessor 6 
may file in the registry of deeds of any county, with respect to real property, or in the 7 
office of the Secretary  of State, with respect to property of a type for which a security 8 
interest may be perfected by a filing in such office under Title 11, Article 9 -A, a notice of 9 
lien specifying the amount of the tax, interest, penalties and costs due, the name and last 10 
known address of the person liable for the amount and, in the case of a tax imposed by 11 
this Title, the fact that the assessor has complied with all the provisions of this Title in the 12 
assessment of the tax.  Filing of the lien by the assessor constitutes noti ce of lien for, and 13 
secures payment of, both the original assessment and all subsequent assessments of tax 14 
against the same person, until such time as the lien is released or otherwise discharged as 15 
provided for in this section.  The lien imposed by this s ection is not valid against any 16 
mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, judgment creditor or holder of a properly recorded 17 
security interest until notice of the lien has been filed by the assessor, with respect to real 18 
property, in the registry of deeds of the coun ty where such property is located and, with 19 
respect to personal property, in the office in which a financing statement for such 20 
personal property is normally filed.  Notwithstanding this subsection, a tax lien upon 21 
personal property does not extend to thos e types of personal property not subject to 22 
perfection of a security interest by means of the filing in the office of the Secretary of 23 
State.  The lien is prior to any mortgage or security interest recorded, filed or otherwise 24 
perfected after the notice, o ther than a purchase -money security interest perfected in 25 
accordance with Title 11, Article 9 -A.  In the case of any mortgage or security interest 26 
properly recorded or filed prior to the notice of lien that secures future advances by the 27 
mortgagee or secur ed party, the lien is junior to all advances made within 45 days after 28 
filing of the notice of lien, or made without knowledge of the lien or pursuant to a 29 
commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien.  Subject to the limitations in this 30 
section, the lien provided in this subsection has the same force, effect and priority as a 31 
judgment lien and continues for 10 years from the date of recording unless sooner 32 
released or otherwise discharged.  The lien may, within the 10 -year period, or within 10 33 
years from the date of the last extension of the lien in the manner provided in this 34 
subsection, be extended by filing for record in the appropriate office a copy of the notice 35 
and, from the time of filing, that lien must be extended for 10 years unless soone r 36 
released or otherwise discharged.  If the lien is extended within the 10 -year period, or 37 
within 10 years from the date of the last extension of the lien as provided for in this 38 
subsection, the extended lien relates back to the date the lien was first fil ed. 39 
This subsection applies to assessments made on or after August 1, 2016.  40

SUMMARY  17 
The intent of Part A of thi s bill is to improve the State’s ability to collect sales and 18 
use taxes owed to the State by, beginning August 1, 2016:  19 
1.  Strengthening the existing tax lien provisions to increase the State’s ability to be 20 
first in line in priority ahead of other credit ors for payment on a tax debt;  21 
2.  Broadening the existing responsible individual liability provision for sales and use 22 
taxes to include sales and use taxes required to be collected by a business, whether or not 23 
actually collected; and  24 
3.  Including within  the new responsible individual provision the existing responsible 25 
person liability for uncollected fuel taxes.  26 
Part B of this bill makes technical changes to the income tax laws, including:  27 
1.  Changing the date an information return, such as a Form W -2, must be filed with 28 
Maine Revenue Services from February 28th to January 31st following the calendar year 29 
to which the information return relates.  The change in the due date applies to information 30 
returns made for calendar years beginning on or after Janua ry 1, 2016.  The change is 31 
consistent with recently enacted federal law; and  32 
2.  Replacing the current individual income tax addition modification equal to the 33 
phase -out amount of a taxpayer's Maine standard deduction or itemized deductions with a 34 
phase -out amount used to calculate the taxpayer's allowable Maine standard deduction or 35 
itemized deductions.  The calculation of the phase -out amount is unchanged and, as under 36 
current law, applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.  37
