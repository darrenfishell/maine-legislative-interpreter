Fiscal Note 
Contingent future biennium savings -General Fund 
This bill will become effective only if approved by the voters of Oxbow Plantation at the next general election to be 
held in November. If approved by the voters, and if a withdrawal agreement is executed with Maine School 
Administrative District (MSAD) 32, the deorganization of Oxbow Plantation would take effect on July 1, 2017. The 
Division of State Schools -Education in the Unorganized Territories program in the Department of Education will 
incur future General Fund expenditures to provide services to the Unorganized Territories. These ongoing 
expenditures would be to provide schooling to students from Oxbow Plantation. The General Fund would be fully 
reimbursed for these costs by higher collections made through the Municipal Cost Component program. The amount 
is estimated to be approximately $38,478 annually. 
The deorganization of Oxbow Plantation will result in savings to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program 
within the Department of Education. The amount of savings can not be determined at this time. Oxbow Plantation is 
estimated to receive approximately $17 ,250 in subsidy in fiscal year 2016-17. 
If the deorganization is approved by the voters of Oxbow North Township, the General Fund would also incur savings 
of $25,000 beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 for reduced reimbursements through the Tree Growth Tax 
Reimbursement program.
