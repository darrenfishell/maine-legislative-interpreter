 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect before the expiration of the 90 -day 3 
period to provid e funding as soon as possible to ensure the continuation of racing if a 4 
commercial track closes; and  5 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 6 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legi slation as 7 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 8 
therefore,  9 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  10 
Sec. 1.  8 MRSA §267 -A, sub -§2, ¶¶B and C, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 539, 11

Sec. 3.  8 MRSA §299, sub -§3 is enacted to read:  19 
3.  Track closure.   Notwithstanding subsection 2, if a commercial track ceases 20 
operation and is not immediately  replaced by a commercial track in the same region that 21 
is owned by the same owner as the commercial track that ceased operation, all amounts 22 
credited to the fund established by this section must be disbursed to the remaining 23 
commercial tracks and to agric ultural fairs based on days raced during extended meets up 24 
to a maximum of 100 days raced during extended meets per year and until such time as a 25 
new commercial track begins operation.  The payment to a commercial track or 26 
agricultural fair is determined b y dividing the amount in the fund by 150 and multiplying 27 
the product by the number of days raced by that commercial track or agricultural fair.  An 28 
agricultural fair must receive its payment on May 30th before extended meets are held 29 
based on assigned date s for extended meets for that agricultural fair.  An adjustment must 30 
be made no later than the January 30th following the extended meets that results in 31 
payment to an agricultural fair based on days actually raced during extended meets by 32 
that agricultural  fair.  Any amount remaining in the fund on January 30th after payments 33 
are made to commercial tracks and agricultural fairs must be transferred to the operating 34 
account of the commission under section 267 -A. 35 
For the purposes of this subsection, "region" i s determined by measuring a distance of 50 36

further amended to read:  4 
H.  Four percent of the net s lot machine income must be forwarded by the board to 5 
the Treasurer of State, who shall credit the money to the Fund to Encourage Racing at 6 
Maine's Commercial Tracks, established in section 299 ; however, the payment 7 
required by this paragraph is terminated when all commercial tracks have obtained a 8 
license to operate slot machines in accordance with this chapter, in which case, that 9 
4% of the net slot machine income must be credited to the General Fund as 10 
undedicated revenue ; 11 
Emergency clause.  In view of th e emergency cited in the preamble, this 12 
legislation takes effect when approved.  13 
SUMMARY  14 
This bill removes the provision of law that terminates certain payments of net slot 15 
machine income to the Fund to Encourage Racing at Maine's Commercial Tracks when 16 
all commercial tracks have obtained a license to operate slot machines.  It also provides 17 
that if a commercial track ceases operation and is not immediately replaced by a 18 
commercial track in the same region that is owned by the same owner as the commercial 19 
track that ceased operation, all amounts in the fund must be disbursed to the remaining 20 
commercial tracks and to agricultural fairs based on days raced during extended meets up 21 
to a maximum of 100 days raced during extended meets per year and until such time  as a 22 
new commercial track begins operation.  23 
A commercial track or agricultural fair receives a payment per race day equal to the 24 
quotient of the amount in the fund divided by 150.  Any amount remaining in the fund 25 
after payments are made to commercial tra cks and agricultural fairs must be transferred to 26 
the operating account of the Harness Racing Commission.  27
