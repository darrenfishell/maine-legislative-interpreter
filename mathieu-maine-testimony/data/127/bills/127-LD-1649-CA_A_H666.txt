If the commission concludes that both conditions under paragraphs A and B will be met, 
the rules established pursuant to subsection 10 remain in effect, and net energy billing 
pursuant to section 3209-A is not available to new customers in the future. 
If the commission concludes that the condition under paragraph A or B will not be met, 
the commission shall make findings regarding the reasons the condition will not be met 
and provide a report summarizing its conclusions to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over utility matters within 30 days of the start of the First 
Regular Session of the 129th Legislature. If the commission determines that the rules 
adopted under this section can be modified to enable the program to meet procurement 
targets or reduce costs so that the conditions under paragraphs A and B are likely to be 
met in the future, it shall make and submit such changes to the First Regular Session of 
the 129th Legislature. If the commission determines that these rules cannot be modified 
to meet these targets or reduce costs, the commission shall review its net energy billing 
rules or recommend alternative mechanisms to support distributed generation in a manner 
that benefits all ratepayers. If the commission does not propose changes to the rules 
adopted pursuant to subsection 10 or new rules are not adopted within 60 days of the 
adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature, net energy billing 
pursuant to section 3209-A must be made available to new customers beginning 60 days 
after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.' 
Amend the bill in section 7 in the first line (page 13, line 40 in L.D.) by striking out 
the following: "Siting of solar distributed generation resources." and inserting the 
following: 'Report; siting of solar distributed generation resources on pre-existing 
impervious surfaces or brownfields.' 
Amend the bill by adding after section 7 the following: 
'Sec. 8. Report; siting of solar distributed generation resources on 
farmland. By January 1, 2017, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry shall submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
jurisdiction over energy and utilities matters and the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over agricultural matters a report that evaluates what 
actions can be taken to ensure that any new solar distributed generation resource procured 
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, sections 3477 to 3479 and proposed 
to be built on farmland designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland of statewide 
importance" by the United States Department of Agriculture, is designed and built in a 
manner that does not remove topsoil or otherwise permanently impair the suitability of 
that land for future agricultural use. The report must also include an evaluation of what 
actions can be taken to ensure that the decommissioning of solar distributed generation 
resources procured pursuant to Title 35-A, sections 3477 to 3479 on farmland that is 
designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland of statewide importance" occurs in a 
manner that enables the farmland to be returned to agricultural use. The report may 
include recommendations for legislation that may be necessary to address these issues. 
The joint standing committees may each report out a bill to the First Regular Session of 
the 128th Legislature based on the report. The Public Utilities Commission may not 
contract for a new solar distributed generation resource pursuant to Title 35-A, sections 
3477 to 3479 if it is to be sited on farmland designated as "prime farmland" or "farmland

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to arrange for a solar power offer, conduct competitive 
solicitations for solar distributed generation resources and initiate a proceeding. The bill establishes one Utility 
Analyst -Public Services Coordinator III position and one Staff Attorney -Public Services Coordinator III position to 
take part in the required proceedings, rulemakings and periodic solicitations and contract evaluations. This bill 
includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of$215,318 in fiscal year 2016-17 for these two positions. The 
PUC will receive $215,318 in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue in fiscal year 2016-17 from increased 
assessments to fund these two new positions. 
The bill also requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to submit a report to the 
Legislature that evaluates what actions can be taken to ensure that any new solar distributed generation resource 
procured and proposed to be built on certain farmland does not remove topsoil or impair the suitabiltiy of that land for 
agricultural use. ACF has indicated the cost to hire a consultant to prepare this report would be $10,000. The bill 
includes a one-time General Fund appropriation in fiscal year 2016-17 for this purpose.
