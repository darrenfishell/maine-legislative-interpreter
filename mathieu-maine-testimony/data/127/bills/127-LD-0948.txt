to read:  3 
§1695.  Disclosure of information on chemicals of high concern and priority 4 
chemicals  5 
1.  Reporting of chem ical use.  A person who is a manufacturer or distributor of a 6 
children's product for sale in the State that contains a priority chemical, as identified 7 
pursuant to section 1694,  chemical of high concern  in an amount greater than a de 8 
minimis level shall no tify the department in writing on an annual basis in accordance with 9 
rules adopted by the department,  unless waived by the commissioner pursuant to this 10 
section or exempt from this chapter pursuant to section 1697. This written notice must be 11 
made within 1 80 days after a priority chemical is identified. If the sale of the children's 12 
product does not commence until after the 180 -day reporting period ends, this written 13 
notice must be made within 30 days of sale of the children's product in the State.  This 14 
written notice must identify the children's product, the number of units sold or distributed 15 
for sale in the State or nationally, the priority  chemical or chemicals of high concern  16 
contained in the children's product, the amount of such chemicals in each unit  of 17 
children's product and the intended purpose of the chemicals in the children's product.  18 
Not later than January 1, 2016, the department shall adopt rules to implement this 19 
subsection.  The rules adopted pursuant to this subsection:  20 
A.  May establish tie rs for submitting the required notice that take into account the 21 
size of the manufacturer and the exposure potential of the product, as long as the 22 
rules require that the initial notices be submitted within 180 days and all notices be 23 
submitted within 5 ye ars of the effective date of the rule; and  24 
B.  Must require notification for each category of products subject to reporting, unless 25 
the commissioner finds that a lower level of reporting is justified on the basis of 26 
credible scientific evidence and consist ent with section 1692, including the goal of 27 
reducing exposure of vulnerable populations to chemicals of high concern.  28 
Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 29 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 30 
2.  Supplementa l information.  The manufacturer or distributor of a children's 31 
product that contains a priority chemical shall provide the following additional 32 
information if requested by the department:  33 
A.  Information on the likelihood that the chemical will be release d from the 34 
children's product to the environment during the children's product's life cycle and the 35 
extent to which users of the children's product are likely to be exposed to the 36 
chemical;  37 
B.  Information on the extent to which the chemical is present in  the environment or 38 
human body; and  39 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1212(01) -1 
 C.  An assessment of the availability, cost, feasibility and performance, including 1 
potential for harm to human health and the environment, of alternatives to the priority 2 
chemical and the reason the priority chemical is  used in the manufacture of the 3 
children's product in lieu of identified alternatives.  If an assessment acceptable to the 4 
department is not timely submitted, the department may assess a fee on the 5 
manufacturer or distributor to cover the costs to prepare an independent report on the 6 
availability of safer alternatives by a contractor of the department's choice.  7 
The manufacturer or distributor of a children's product that contains a priority chemical 8 
may provide additional information to the department regar ding the potential for harm to 9 
human health and the environment from specific uses of the priority chemical.  10 
3.  Waiver of reporting; fee; extension of deadline.  The commissioner may waive 11 
all or part of the notification requirement under subsection 1  fo r one or more specified 12 
uses of a priority chemical if the commissioner determines that substantially equivalent 13 
information is already publicly available, that the information is not needed for the 14 
purposes of this chapter or that the specified use or use s are minor in volume.  The 15 
department may assess a fee payable by the manufacturer or distributor upon submission 16 
of the notification to cover the department's reasonable costs in managing the information 17 
collected.  The department may extend the deadline  for submission of the information 18 
required under subsection 1 for one or more specified uses of a priority chemical in a 19 
children's product if it determines that more time is needed by the manufacturer or 20 
distributor to comply with the submission requirem ent or if the information is not needed 21 
at that time.  22 
4.  Rulemaking to determine fees.   If the department assesses a fee pursuant to 23 
subsection 2, paragraph C or subsection 3, the department shall determine the appropriate 24 
fee through major substantive ru lemaking, as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 25 
2-A. 26

SUMMARY  14 
This bill amends the laws governing toxic chemicals in children's products in order to 15 
ensure consistency with si milar laws enacted in other states.  16 
The bill requires annual reporting of the use of chemicals of high concern in 17 
children's products sold in Maine, phased in over a 5 -year period, with implementing 18 
rules adopted by January 1, 2016.  19 
The bill requires the C ommissioner of Environmental Protection to designate 3 20 
priority products that contain a chemical of high concern or a priority chemical by 21 
January 1, 2017.  Such a designation triggers an assessment of the availability of safer 22 
alternatives by the manufact urer or distributor of a priority product, as authorized by 23 
existing law.  24 
The bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt, not later than 25 
January 1, 2016, a rule designating 4 phthalates as priority chemicals and requiring 26 
manufacture rs and distributors of children's products containing those phthalates to report 27 
to the department.  28
