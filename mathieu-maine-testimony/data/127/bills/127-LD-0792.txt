sexual touching by adding additional medical professionals licensed under the Maine 7 
Revised Statutes, Title 32 to the list of persons prohibited from having certain 8 
relationships or contact with patients and adds the definition of "health care services 9 
providers" to Title 17 -A, chapter 11.  "Health care services providers" includes 10 
physician s, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, physician assistants 11 
and nurses.  12
