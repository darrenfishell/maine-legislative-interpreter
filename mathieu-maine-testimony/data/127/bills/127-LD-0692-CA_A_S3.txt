Potential current biennium revenue decrease -Federal Expenditures Fund 
This legislation authorizes the Department of Education to make statutory and regulatory changes in order to comply 
with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Being out of compliance with ESEA may result 
in the loss of approximately $72.1 million in Title 1 and other federal funds per year. 
The provision of this bill that requires a school administrative unit (SAU) to submit a plan describing the intentions of 
its pilot project to the Department of Education by July 15, 2015 is considered to fall under the mandate exemption 
pursuant to Public Law 2011, c. 635. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with the rulemaking process can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
