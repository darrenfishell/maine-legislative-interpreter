 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA ยง5686 is enacted to read:  2 
ยง5686.  Local sales tax increment disbursement  3 
1.  Local sales tax increment.   Beginning with fiscal year 2016 -17, the State Tax 4 
Assessor shall, base d on available taxable retail sales data as derived from state sales tax 5 
collections, excluding taxable retail sales data for lodging and restaurants, determine the 6 
amount of sales tax revenue and the amount of the local sales tax increment for each 7 
fiscal  year that is attributable to each municipality and the unorganized territory under 8 
Title 36, Part 3.  For the purposes of this section, "local sales tax increment" means 5% of 9 
the increase in revenue attributable to a municipality or the unorganized terri tory under 10 
Title 36, Part 3 over the amount attributable to the municipality or the unorganized 11 
territory in fiscal year 2016 -17 and every 4th year thereafter.  12 
2.  Transfers.   Beginning with fiscal year 2017 -18, the State Tax Assessor shall 13 
certify to the State Controller by September 30th annually the local sales tax increment 14 
amounts needed to make payments under this section.  The State Controller shall, within 15 
15 days after the certification, transfer those amounts to a local sales tax increment 16 
account , which must be established for this purpose.  17 
3.  Payments to municipalities and the unorganized territory.   The Treasurer of 18 
State shall pay by October 1st annually to each municipality and the Unorganized 19 
Territory Education and Services Fund under Title  36, chapter 115 from the local sales 20 
tax increment account established pursuant to subsection 2 an amount equal to the local 21 
sales tax increment.  If the local sales tax increment for a municipality or the unorganized 22 
territory is $0 or less, a payment ma y not be made for that fiscal year.  The Treasurer of 23 
State shall pay the amount due under this section and provide an accounting of the 24 
amount to the municipality or the fiscal administrator of the unorganized territory no later 25 
than 6 months after the en d of that fiscal year.  The amount received under this section by 26 
a municipality or the fund may not reduce or be reduced by any other revenue sharing or 27 
state aid received by the municipality or the fund.  A municipality or the fiscal 28 
administrator of the  unorganized territory shall reduce the property tax levy, as defined in 29 
section 5721 -A, subsection 1, paragraph D, in an amount equal to the payments received 30 
under this section in the fiscal year that the local sales tax increment revenue is received.  31 
SUMMARY  32 
This bill requires payments beginning in fiscal year 2017 -18 to municipalities of an 33 
amount, as determined by the State Tax Assessor, equal to 5% of the difference between 34 
the sales and use tax revenue attributable to the municipality in a fiscal yea r and the 35 
comparable amounts for fiscal year 2016 -17, referred to as the "local sales tax 36 
increment."  If the amount of sales and use tax collected in a fiscal year in a municipality 37 
is below that collected in fiscal year 2016 -17, then the municipality rec eives no payment.  38 
The base year for determining the local sales tax increment is reset in fiscal year 2020 -21 39 
and every 4 years thereafter.  The amount received may not reduce any other state aid or 40 
revenue sharing received by that municipality, and the m unicipality must use the amount 41

 received to reduce property taxes by the same amount.  The Unorganized Territory 1 
Education and Services Fund receives the local sales tax increment payment for the 2 
unorganized territory and is subject to the same requirement  to use the revenue to reduce 3 
property taxes.  4
