127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT :B" to H.P. 152, L.D. 220, Bill, "An Act To 
Require Proper Notification of Life Insurance Cancellation" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, coverage under the group life insurance coverage program administered 
by the Maine Public Employees Retirement System may be terminated for nonpayment of 
premium if premiums are not paid when due at the end of the month; and 
Whereas, employees have no recourse to reinstate coverage following termination; 
and 
Whereas, employees may not have received notice of cancellation during an unpaid 
leave of absence due to an accident or illness and family members learn of the 
termination of coverage only following the death of the employee; and 
Whereas, this legislation would allow employees to designate a 3rd party to also 
receive a notice of cancellation prior to the termination of life insurance coverage to 
provide further protection to avoid termination of coverage; and 
Whereas, immediate enactment of this legislation is needed to help preserve life 
insurance coverage for employees and their families; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, ' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 5 MRS A §18058, sub-§l, ~ is enacted to read:
