36 COMMlTTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 267, L.D. 401 
Procedure. "Parties in interest" includes mortgagors, holders of fee interest, mortgagees, 
lessees pursuant to recorded leases or memoranda thereof, lienors and attaching creditors 
all as reflected by the indices in the registry of deeds and the documents referred to 
therein affecting the mortgaged premises, through the time of the recording of the 
complaint or the clerk's certificate. Failure to join any party in interest does not invalidate 
the action nor any subsequent proceedings as to those joined. Failure of the mortgagee to 
join, as a party in interest, the holder of any public utility easement recorded subsequent 
to the mortgage and pri<?r to commencement of foreclosure proceedings is deemed 
consent by the mortgagee to that easement. Any other party having a claim to the real 
estate whose claim is not recorded in the registry of deeds as of the time of recording of 
the copy of the complaint or the clerk's certificate need not be joined in the foreclosure 
action, and any such party has no claim against the real estate after completion of the 
foreclosure sale, except that any such party may move to intervene in the action for the 
purpose of being added as a party in interest at any time prior to the entry of judgment. 
Within 10 days of submitting the complaint for filing with the court, the mortgagee shall 
provide a copy of the complaint or of the clerk's certificate as submitted to the court that 
prominently states, immediately after the title, the street address of the mortgaged 
premises, if any, and the book and page number of the mortgage, if any, to "the municipal 
tax assessor of the municipality in which the property is located and, if the mortgaged 
premises is manufactured housing as defined in Title 10, section 9002, subsection 7, to 
the owner of any land leased by the mortgagor. The failure to provide the notice required 
by this section does not affect the validity of the foreclosure sale.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill but still requires proof of the owner of the mortgage 
note to be included in the foreclosure complaint. 
The Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule l2(b)(6) provides that a complaint must be 
dismissed if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This amendment 
makes a foreclosure case subject to dismissal ifit does not include a certification of proof 
of the owner of the mortgage note. The purpose of this amendment is to remove the 
ambiguity left by the Law Court in Bank of America v. Cloutier, 2013 ME 17,61 A.3d. 
1242, in which the Law Court held that the plaintiffs must identify the owner of a loan 
but did not say when and how that identification must occur. This amendment requires 
the identification at the begi1ll1ing of the lawsuit when the parties most need that 
information as they engage in mediation and loan modification efforts.
