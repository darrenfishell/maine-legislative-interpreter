127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 21, L.D. 22, Bill, "An Act To Require 
Removal of Mooring Equipment" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act Regarding the Removal of Moorings and Floating Docks in Great Ponds 
During Ice-in Conditions' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 38 MRSA ยง3, as amended by PL 2003, c. 660, Pt. A, ยง23, is further 
amended by adding at the end a new paragraph to read: 
A harbor master, a code enforcement officer or, in the case of a great pond located in 
an unorganized territory, a board of county commissioners of the county in which the 
unorganized territory is located may direct the master or owner of a boat or vessel to 
remove that person's mooring or floating dock from a great pond if the harbor master, 
code enforcement officer or the board of county commissioners determines that leaving 
the mooring or floating dock in during ice-in conditions would create a public safety 
hazard. This section does not authorize a harbor master, code enforcement officer or 
board of county commissioners to direct the removal of a federally owned or state-owned 
mooring or floating dock.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which proposes to require the removal of mooring 
equipment protruding above the surface of great ponds by December 1 st. This 
amendment authorizes a harbor master, a code enforcement officer or a board of county 
commissioners to direct the owner of a boat to remove that person's mooring or floating 
dock from a great pond if the harbor master, code enforcement officer or board of county 
commissioners determines that leaving the mooring or floating dock in during ice-in 
conditions would create a public safety hazard.
