COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1069, L.D. 1576 
1 Amend the bill in section 12 in subsection 7 in the 3rd and 4th lines (page 7, lines 6 
2 and 7 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "the school administrative unit that has" and 
3 inserting the following: 'the Department of Education as having' 
4 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 13. 
5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment makes the following changes to the bill. 
7 1. It provides that once the Commissioner of Education makes a designation to emoll 
8 a student who resides in a school administrative unit that neither maintains a school nor 
9 contracts with another school administrative unit, the student must be emolled in the 
10 receiving school administrative unit designated by the commissioner. If dissatisfied with 
11 the commissioner's decision, the superintendent of the school administrative unit where 
12 the student resides or the superintendent of the receiving school administrative unit may, 
13 within 10 calendar days of the commissioner's decision, request that the State Board of 
14 Education review the transfer; the state board may approve or disapprove the 
15 commissioner's designation. 
16 2. It amends the enrollment preference provision in the public charter school 
17 eligibility statute to require, rather than allow, as in the bill, a public charter school 
18 authorized by a local school board or by a collaborative among local school boards to 
19 give emollment preference to residents of the school administrative unit or units whose 
20 school board or school boards authorized the public charter school.

27 3. It provides that, when the Department of Health and Human Services places a 
state ward in an out-of-state residential treatment center, the Commissioner of Education 
may designate the Department of Education as having responsibility for the oversight of 
the child's individualized education program. 
4. It strikes the proposal in the bill that authorizes the Commissioner of Education to 
provide additional funds to a school administrative unit based on a budgetary hardship 
resulting from a special education placement.
