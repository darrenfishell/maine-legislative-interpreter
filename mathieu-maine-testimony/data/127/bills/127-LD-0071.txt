This bill repeals language that was included when this section of law was amended in 21 
2013 that required the law to be repealed Septemb er 1, 2016, at which time the original 22 
law would go back into effect.  The section of law that continues in effect requires that a 23

good faith attempts to serve the def endant in hand have been unsuccessful.  It requires the 25

the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure when the court orders service by the mailing and 27 
posting of the summons and complaint.  28
