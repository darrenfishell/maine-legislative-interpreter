 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the people of the State need and deserve a variety of well -planned and 3 
financially stable long-term care services in home -based and community -based care 4 
settings and in nursing facilities in their communities; and  5 
Whereas, recent closures of nursing facilities, in particular in rural and underserved 6 
areas of the State, have had a significant im pact on Maine families and communities; and  7 
Whereas, in order to provide high -quality care to Maine's elderly and disabled 8 
persons and to maintain access to services across the State, the Legislature must take 9 
immediate action to continue a thoughtful and thorough planning process; and  10 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 11 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 12 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public pe ace, health and safety; now, 13 
therefore, be it  14 
Sec. 1.  Amendment of Principles of Reimbursement for Nursing 15 
Facilities.  Resolved:  That the Department of Health and Human Services shall amend 16 
Rule Chapter 101, MaineCare Benefits Manual, Chapter III, Secti on 67, Principles of 17 
Reimbursement for Nursing Facilities as follows.  18 
1.  Occupancy adjustment.   The rule must be amended to decrease the occupancy 19 
percentage threshold required for a nursing facility with more than 60 beds from 90% to 20 
80% and for a nursin g facility with 60 beds or fewer from 85% to 75%.  21 
2.  Continuing education for direct care staff.   The rule must be amended so that 22 
the cost of continuing education for direct care staff is included as a direct care cost 23 
component rather than a routine cos t component.  24 
3.  Crossover payments.   The rule must be amended to restore crossover payments 25 
to nursing facilities related to the nondual Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program 26 
population of the Medicare Savings Program for whom coverage was eliminated in 27 
Public Law 2013, chapter 368.  28 
4.  Critical access nursing facility designation.  The rule must be amended to create 29 
a critical access nursing facility designation using criteria that are sensitive to the unique 30 
access challenges in remote areas of the Stat e.  The rule must also be amended to provide 31 
that a critical access nursing facility designation qualifies as an allowable exception to 32 
MaineCare budget neutrality.  The department shall seek the approval of the federal 33 
Department of Health and Human Servi ces, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 34 
for the new designation and implement it by April 15, 2015.  35
