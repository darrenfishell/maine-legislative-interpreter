PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. QQQ expanded the educational opportunity tax credit to include consolidated loans for tax years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2016. This legislation provides that consolidated loans are eligible in tax year 2015 
provided that the consolidated loans only include educational loans. This would reduce General Fund revenue by 
$24,500 in fiscal year 2015-16 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue by $500 in fiscal year 2015-16.
