4.  Commitment for observation.  The court may commit the defendant to the 4 
custody of the Commissi oner of Health and Human Services for placement in the secure, 5 
therapeutic mental health unit established pursuant to Title 34 -A, section 4303 unless the 6 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services determines the defendant's placement in 7 
that unit is contrai ndicated, in which case the defendant may be placed in  an appropriate  8 
alternative  institution that is appropriate  for the care and treatment of people with mental 9 
illness or in an appropriate residential program that provides care and treatment for 10 
persons  who have intellectual disabilities or autism, as set forth in this subsection.  If the 11 
State Forensic Service determines that observation of the defendant will materially 12 
enhance its ability to perform an examination ordered pursuant to subsection 1, 2, 3  or 9 13 
and the defendant is incarcerated, the observation may take place at the correctional 14 
facility where the defendant is incarcerated if the State Forensic Service determines that 15 
the correctional facility can provide an appropriate setting for the obse rvation.  If the 16 
observation is to take place in a correctional facility, the court may not commit the 17 
defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services.  18 
A.  If the State Forensic Service determines that observation of the defendant  in the 19 
secure, therapeutic mental health unit or  an appropriate  alternative  institution that is 20 
appropriate  for the care of people with mental illness or in an appropriate residential 21 
program that provides care and treatment for persons who have intellect ual 22 
disabilities or autism will materially enhance its ability to perform an examination 23 
ordered pursuant to subsection 1, 2, 3 or 9, the State Forensic Service shall so advise 24 
the court.  The State Forensic Service may make this determination based upon 25 
consultation with the defendant’s attorney and the attorney for the State and the court 26 
and upon such other information as it determines appropriate.  In addition, the State 27 
Forensic Service may include such a determination in a report to the court that 28 
recommends further evaluation of the defendant.  29 
B.  Upon a determination by the State Forensic Service under paragraph A, a court 30 
having jurisdiction in a criminal case may commit the defendant to the custody of the 31 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services f or placement in the secure, therapeutic 32 
mental health unit unless the Commissioner of Health and Human Services 33 
determines the defendant's placement in that unit is contraindicated, in which case the 34 
defendant may be placed in  an appropriate  alternative  institution that is appropriate  35 
for the care and treatment of people with mental illness or in an appropriate 36 
residential program that provides care and treatment for persons who have intellectual 37 
disabilities or autism for observation for a period not to ex ceed 60 days.  If the State 38 
Forensic Service requires additional time for observation, it shall communicate its 39 
request and the reasons for that request to the court and to counsel for the parties.  40 
The court shall accommodate a party's request to be heard  on the issue of whether an 41 
extension should be granted and may extend the commitment for up to an additional 42 
90 days.  Unless the defendant objects, an order under this paragraph must authorize 43 
the institution or residential program where the defendant is  placed by the 44 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1147(01) -1 
 Commissioner of Health and Human Services to provide treatment to the defendant.  1 
When further observation of the defendant is determined no longer necessary by the 2 
State Forensic Service, the commissioner shall report that determination to the court 3 
and the court shall terminate the commitment.  If the defendant had been incarcerated 4 
prior to the commitment for observation and if, during the period of observation, the 5 
defendant presents a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to staff or  others that 6 
cannot be managed in an appropriate institution for the care and treatment of people 7 
with mental illness or in an appropriate residential program that provides care and 8 
treatment for persons who have intellectual disabilities or autism, the co mmissioner 9 
may return the defendant to the correctional facility  shall commit the defendant to the 10 
secure, therapeutic mental health unit .  The commissioner shall report the risk 11 
management issues to the court. Upon receiving the report, the court shall re view the 12 
report and may enter any order authorized by this section, including termination of 13 
the commitment.  14 
C.  If the court has provided for remand to a correctional facility following the 15 
commitment under paragraph B, the correctional facility shall exe cute the remand 16 
order upon advice from the Commissioner of Health and Human Services that 17 
commitment is determined no longer necessary.  18
