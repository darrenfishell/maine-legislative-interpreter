 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, school administrative units are administering standardized tests before the 3 
end of this sc hool year; and  4 
Whereas, it is unlikely that the 90 -day period will end prior to the administration of 5 
the standardized tests; and  6 
Whereas, the provisions of this resolve effect how school administrators will use the 7 
results of the standardized tests to eva luate teachers; and  8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9

therefore, be it  12 
Sec. 1.  School administrative units to delay use of Maine educational 13

school year to evaluate educator effectiveness under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17 
20-A, section 13704, subsection 2.  18 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergen cy cited in the preamble, this 19 
legislation takes effect when approved.  20 
SUMMARY  21
