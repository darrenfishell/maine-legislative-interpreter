Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation renames the Board of Dental Examiners, affiliated with the Department of Professional and Financial 
Regulation, the Maine Board of Oral Health. This bill also makes changes to the duties, functions and responsibilities 
of the board and its established subcommittees and creates a Subcommittee on Dentists. This bill includes Other 
Special Revenue Funds allocations of $162,470 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $191,980 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the 
Maine Board of Oral Health for one Office Associate 11 position, additional per diem costs for board and 
subcommittee members, and related all other costs including legal, fmancial and technology services associated with 
the increased duties and responsibilities of the subcommittees. This bill also includes other offsetting allocations and 
deallocations netting to zero of $399,461 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $531,216 in fiscal year 2016-17 move functions 
from the old board to the new board in the accounting system. This fiscal note assumes an October 1, 2015 effective 
date. It also assumes that the initiatives included in LD 1019, the Governor's proposed budget for the 2016-2017 
biennium for the Board of Dental Examiners are adopted as proposed. The fiscal note may need to be adjusted based 
on final legislative actions on the biennial budget. 
An analysis performed by the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation indicates that license fees will 
need to be increased in order to support the additional costs to each subcommitte and the board. This analysis assumes 
that each subcommittee will be self-supporting and will share in the costs of supporting the board. According to the 
department, license fees for dentists will need to increase from $440 biennially to $495 biennially; license fees for 
dental hygienists will need to increase from $140 biennially to $390 biennially; and license fees for denturists will 
need to increase from $140 biennially to $5,300 biennially. As the new fee for denturists is impractically high, it is 
unclear how the board will procede. The higher fees, if actually collected, are expected to increase dedicated revenue 
to the board by $60,384 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $405,014 in fiscal year 2016-17.
