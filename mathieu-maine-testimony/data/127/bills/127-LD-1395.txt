SUMMARY  15 
This bill seeks to enhance legislative oversight of quasi -independent state entities by 16 
ensuring that joint standing committees of jurisdiction are monitoring the entities' 17 
compliance with req uirements in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, sections 12022 and 18 
12023, and alerting the Government Oversight Committee to any concerns identified. The 19 
statutory requirements address expectations for quasi -independent state entities with 20 
regard to proc urement practices, payments for membership dues and fees, gifts, donations 21 
and sponsorships and travel, meal and entertainment expenses.  This bill provides for 22 
review of those reports by those committees and their communicating to the Government 23 
Oversight  Committee the results of the reviews and areas identified that should be 24 
reviewed in more depth.  25
