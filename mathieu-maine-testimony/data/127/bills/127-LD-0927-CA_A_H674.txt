"correctional facility" has the same meaning as in Title 34-A, section 1001, subsection 6. 
2. Correctional facility employees. Notwithstanding section 17852 and any other 
provision of law, the service retirement benefit for a member for whom an appropriation 
of funds has been made under subsection 4 is computed as provided in subsection 3 if the

1 4. Appropriation of funds. The service retirement benefit for a member who meets

12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment strikes the bill and replaces it with language that allows employees 
14 at certain state correctional facilities who have not reached their normal retirement age to 
15 retire and receive their full retirement benefit if certain conditions are met and funding is 
16 appropriated for the additional actuarial costs that result from the elimination of a 
17 reduction for retirement prior to normal retirement age. 
18 This amendment requires the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services 
19 to provide certification of the pending closur1~ of a state correctional facility to the Maine

21 calculate the amount of funding necessary to pay for the actuarial costs and report that 
22 information to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 
23 retirement matters. The amendment provides that the joint standing committee may 
24 report out legislation appropriating funds for the costs set forth in the report.
