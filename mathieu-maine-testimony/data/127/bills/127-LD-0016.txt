member of the Legislative Retirement Program, except that any Legislator who was a 6 
member of the Maine State Retirement System on December 2, 1986 may choose to be a 7

legislative earnable compensation as provided by Title 5, section 17701.  A Legislator 13 
who terminates employment from a position requiring membership in the State Employee 14 
and Teacher Retirement Program no longer contributes to the State Employee and 15 
Teacher Retirement Program and, if qualified, is eligible to become a benefit recipient 16

of the Legislative Retirement Program.  Except as provided in section 802, subsection 4, 18 
paragraph A, creditable service granted under the State Employee and Teacher 19 
Retirement Program may not be transferred to the Legislative Retirement Program. A 20

Program. 24 
SUMMARY 25

member of the Legislative Retirement Program, which also removes the Legislator from 27 
eligibility for a post-retirement state group health plan. 28
