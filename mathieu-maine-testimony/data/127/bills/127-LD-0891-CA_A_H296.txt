Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 30-A MRSA §3106-A is enacted to read: 
§3106-A. Municipal authority to manage abandoned mobile homes 
1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
following terms have the following meanings. 
A. "Mobile home" has the same meaning as in Title 10, section 9091, subsection 1. 
B. "Property defect" means a condition that, in the judgment of the municipality, 
contribute to blight as a result of the continued lack of care, maintenance or security 
of a property. 
C. "Responsible party" includes the owner of record for a mobile home and each 
record holder of any lien on the mobile home other than a municipality. 
2. Municipal authority. In accordance with this section, the municipal officers may 
regulate the care, maintenance and security of a mobile home determined to be 
abandoned under subsection 4. The authority established by this section may not be 
construed to replace or supplant any municipal authority to provide for basic necessities 
under Title 14, section 6026-A or address dangerous buildings under Title 17, chapter 91, 
subchapter 4. Municipal action under this section may not be interpreted to bestow any 
responsibility on the municipality to safeguard or otherwise preserve or protect an 
abandoned mobile home. A municipality is authorized to take corrective action in 
accordance with this section, up to and including taking possession of and disposing of an 
abandoned mobile home and all related personal property. 
3. Adoption by ordinance. The procedures and standards governing the 
implementation of a municipality's authority to manage certain abandoned mobile homes 
pursuant to this section must be established by municipal ordinance.

and may initiate proceedings consistent with this section if the property is determined to 
be abandoned.'
