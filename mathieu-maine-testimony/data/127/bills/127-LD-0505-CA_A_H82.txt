The bill increases funding to the Local Road Assistance program from 9% to 10% of the Highway Fund allocations to 
the Department of Transportation over a four-year period. The department will require Highway Fund allocations of 
$560,653 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $1,163,073 in fiscal year 2016-17. The bill does not increase revenue to the 
Highway Fund so Highway Fund deallocations would need to be made in the same amount in order for the Fund to 
balance.
