 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, senior citizens are often the targets of fraudulent and exploitive financial 3

as possible to prevent further abuse; and  10
