SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the minority report to the bill reported out of the Joint Standing 
3 Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs regarding tax conformity and funding 
4 for tax conformity. 
5 Part A of this amendment repeals, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 
6 2016, the addition modification that decouples Maine's individual income tax law from 
7 the federal deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses under the United States 
8 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 222. 
9 Part A also decouples the Maine individual and corporate income taxes from the 
10 federal bonus depreciation deductions for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 
11 2015. It provides a Maine capital investment credit for taxable years beginning on or 
12 after January 1, 2015 with respect to depreciable property placed in service in Maine. 
13 The credit is equal to 9% of the amount of the net increase in depreciation attributable to 
14 the depreciation deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the United States Internal 
15 Revenue Code of 1986, Section 168(k) with respect to property placed in service in the 
16 State during the taxable year for taxable corporations; for individuals the credit is 8% of 
17 such amount for tax years beginning in 2015 and is 7% for tax years beginning on or after 
18 January 1, 2016. 
19 Part B transfers $9,535,933 from the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents to the 
20 unappropriated surplus of the General Fund by the end of fiscal year 2015-16. 
21 Part C includes 2 initiatives. The first initiative adjusts funding based on projected 
22 needs in the first year of the biennium in the Veterans Tax Reimbursement program, 
23 which provides an exemption of estates up to a specific value for veterans, under the 
24 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, section 653. The 2nd initiative deappropriates funds no 
25 longer needed for debt service costs. 
26 Part D requires the State Controller to transfer $194,312, by June 30, 2016, from 
27 available balances in Other Special Revenue Funds accounts within the Department of 
28 Environmental Protection to the General Fund unappropriated surplus. 
29 Part E requires the State Controller to transfer the first $6,750,000 of unexpended 
30 Personal Services savings that would otherwise lapse to the General Fund Salary Plan 
31 program to the General Fund unappropriated surplus at the close of fiscal year 2015-16. 
32 This Part also requires the State Controller to transfer funding from the General Fund 
33 Salary Plan program to the General Fund unappropriated surplus in the event that the full 
34 $6,750,000 of Personal Services savings in this Part is not achieved. 
35 Part F requires the State Controller to transfer the first $6,750,000 of unexpended 
36 Personal Services savings that would otherwise lapse to the General Fund Salary Plan 
37 program to the General Fund unappropriated surplus at the close of fiscal year 2016-17. 
38 This Part also requires the State Controller to transfer funding from the General Fund 
39 Salary Plan program to the General Fund unappropriated surplus in the event that the full 
40 $6,750,000 of Personal Services savings in this Part is not achieved.

42 from casino revenues in the December 1, 2015 revenue forecast to the General Fund in 
43 each fiscal year of the 2016-2017 biennium. This Part requires the State Controller to

time transfer, from the General Fund unappropriated surplus to the Fund for Efficient

from the Dirigo Health Fund to the General Fund unappropriated surplus in addition to 
the transfer of $700,000 enacted in Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part W. 
Current law directs the State Controller to conduct recovery audits of payments made
