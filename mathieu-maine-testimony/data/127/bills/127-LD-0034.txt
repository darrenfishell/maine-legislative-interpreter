 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 1 
Sec. 1.  29 -A MRSA ยง2458, sub-ยง2-A, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 486, ยง1, is 2 
amended to read: 3 
2-A.  Mandatory suspension for negligent operation causing death.  The 4 
Secretary of State without preliminary hearing shall suspend a person's license for a 5 
period of at least 3 years a person's license 90 days but no more than 4 years if the 6 
Secretary of State, based on the Secretary of State's records or other sufficient evidence, 7 
finds that person to hav e recklessly or negligently operated a motor vehicle in a manner 8 
so as to cause the death of another person.  Prior to the determination and issuance of the 9 
suspension, the Secretary of State shall notify any family of the victim and shall consider 10 
written or oral statements received from the family in response to the notice.  Upon 11 
suspending the person's license, the Secretary of State shall notify that person of an 12 
opportunity for hearing as provided in section 2483. 13 
SUMMARY 14 
Under current law, the Secretary of State is required to suspend without preliminary 15 
hearing a person's license to drive for a period of at least 3 years if the Secretary of State 16 
finds that person to have recklessly or negligently operated a motor vehicle so as to cause 17 
the death of another person. 18 
This bill reduces the mandatory minimum administrative license suspension from 3 19 
years to 90 days, creates a maximum administrative license suspension period of 4 years 20 
and removes reference to reckless operation as unnecessary since a suspension is 21 
determined by the Secretary of State's application of the lesser civil standard of negligent 22 
operation. 23
