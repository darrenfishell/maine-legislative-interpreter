The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $2,750 in fiscal year 2015-16. The Legislature's 
proposed budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 for legislative studies. Whether this amount is sufficient to 
fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. The

budgeted staffresources. If more than 4 meetings are held during the interim the estimated cost for each additional 
meeting is projected to be $625 for legislative per diem and expenses.

Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with the Commissioner or the commissioner's designee 
serving on the task force can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
