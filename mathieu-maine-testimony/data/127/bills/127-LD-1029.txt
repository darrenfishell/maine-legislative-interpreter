 SUMMARY  1 
This bill directs juvenile community corrections officers, when determining 2 
alternatives based on preliminary investigations, and the court, when entering a 3 
dispositional order for an adjudic ated juvenile, to consider that whenever possible and 4 
appropriate the juvenile be referred to participate in a program intended to increase 5 
community safety by reducing the likelihood of future illegal behavior by the juvenile, to 6 
hold the juvenile account able to the juvenile's victims and the community and to assist 7 
the juvenile in becoming a responsible and productive member of society.  8 
The bill prohibits the use of physical restraints on a juvenile during a court 9 
proceeding and specifies that restraints must be removed prior to the juvenile's 10 
appearance before the court unless a Juvenile Court Judge finds that use of restraints is 11 
necessary because the present behavior of the juvenile represents a current threat to that 12 
juvenile's safety or the safety of others in the courtroom; recent disruptive courtroom 13 
behavior of the juvenile has placed others in potentially harmful situations or presents a 14 
substantial risk of inflicting physical harm on that juvenile or others; present behavior of 15 
the juvenile presen ts a substantial risk of flight from the courtroom; or less restrictive 16 
restraints are unavailable.  17 
Prior to a juvenile's appearance in court, the court is directed to inquire of the 18 
transporting agency and the judicial marshal or other designated court se curity as to 19 
whether reasonable grounds exist for the use of physical restraints in a particular situation 20 
or for a particular juvenile.  If the transporting agency or the judicial marshal or other 21 
designated court security raises a concern that reasonable  grounds exist for the use of 22 
physical restraints, the burden at hearing is on the juvenile to show by a preponderance of 23 
the evidence that reasonable grounds for use of physical restraints do not exist or that a 24 
less restrictive alternative that will alle viate the need for physical restraints exists.  The 25 
court is directed to permit testimony on the issue of whether the use of physical restraints 26 
is necessary in a particular situation or for a particular juvenile.  27 
The bill also amends the provisions regard ing the dissemination of certain juvenile 28 
court records to specify that dissemination may be allowed only with the consent of the 29 
court, after hearing, taking into consideration the purposes of the Maine Juvenile Code.  30 
The bill specifies that police recor ds, juvenile community corrections officers' records 31 
and all other reports of social and clinical studies may not be open to inspection in cases 32 
not open to the general public, and in cases that are open to the general public those 33 
records may be open to i nspection only with the consent of the court, after hearing, taking 34 
into consideration the purposes of the Maine Juvenile Code and the need of the person 35 
seeking to inspect the records to access the information through this process.  The 36 
juvenile, counsel who represented the juvenile at the adjudicatory or dispositional hearing 37 
and the district attorney must be given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be 38 
heard.  39
