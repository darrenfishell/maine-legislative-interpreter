12 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·R "to H.P. 1050, L.D. 1539 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment provides that a municipality may opt to process absentee ballots on 
the 3rd day prior to election day, unlike the bill, which permits absentee ballot processing 
on the 3rd and 4th days. The amendment clarifies that any person may request an 
opportunity to inspect ballots subject to early processing if that person provides notice by 
9:00 a.m. on the day the ballots will be processed. This amendment strikes the portion of 
the bill that allows municipalities to use a high-speed tabulator at a central location for 
counting absentee ballots. 
Finally, this amendment adds an emergency preamble and emergency clause to the 
bill.
