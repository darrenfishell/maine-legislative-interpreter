This floor amendment reduces the fee from 20¢ on each container of consumer packaged pesticides to 10¢ and repeals 
the provision effective 5-1-17. It would result in a reduction in revenue of $120,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
228,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 as compared to the committee amendment. This amendment also results in a 
conesponding reduction in the amount of funds'transferred to the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund 
at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. 
This amendment reduces the Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to $72,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $112,000 
in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund at the University of Maine 
Cooperative Extension for outreach and education initiatives on pest management and pest safety and for non­
administrative costs related t9 its animal and plant disease and insect control laboratory. 
The amendment requires the Pesticides Control Board within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry (ACF) to provide certain retail stores with product codes for every type of pesticide container that may be 
sold by that store by Janu81Y 1, 2016. The committee amendment required ACF to perfonn this annually. This 
amendment removes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $78,855 in fiscal year 2016-17 to hire a contractor to 
assist ACF in providing product codes and for other related costs due to this now being a one-time activity. The 
amendment removes the transfer from the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund to ACF for reimbursing 
costs to provide product codes for pesticide containers. ACF will administer this fund beginning May 1,2017.
