State and establish the amount of that portion of the overall annual quota allocated to 
the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
Indians and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs. 
If persons issued licenses under this section collectively exceed the overall annual quota 
allocated to those persons pursuant to paragraph B, the number of pounds by which the 
license holders exceeded that overall annual quota must be deducted from the following 
year's overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section. If the overage 
exceeds the overall annual quota allocated to persons licensed under this section for the 
following year, the overage must be deducted from the overall annual quota allocated to 
persons licensed under this section in subsequent years until the entire overage has been 
accounted for. 
The commissioner may adopt or amend rules on an emergency basis if immediate action 
is necessary to establish and implement the elver individual fishing quota in advance of 
the beginning of the elver fishing season. 
Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
Sec. 2. 12 lVlRSA §6575-K, sub-§§l and 2, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 485, §9, 
are amended to read: 
1. Prohibition on possession or sale of elvers in excess of elver individual fishing 
quota. A person may not possess or sell a weight of elvers that exceeds the elver 
individual fishing quota that person has been allocated for the fishing season pursuant to 
section 6505-A, subsection 3-A, plus any additional quota the person may be authorized 
to take under section 6575-L. 
2. Prohibition on fishing after elver individual fishing quota has been reached. 
Except as provided in section 6575-L, this section applies to fishing after a person's elver 
individual fishing quota has been reached. A person who has sold a weight of elvers that 
meets or exceeds that person's elver individual fishing quota may not fish for or possess 
elvers for the remainder of the season, except that such a person who has been issued a 
license to fish for elvers may in accordance with section 6575-D assist another person 
who has been issued a license to fish for elvers who has not met or exceeded that person's 
elver individual fishing quota as provided in section 6505-A, subsection 3-A. All gear 
tagged by a license holder who has met or exceeded that person's elver individual fishing 
quota must be removed. A marine patrol officer may seize the elver transaction card of a 
license holder who has met or exceeded that person's elver individual fishing quota. 
Sec. 3. 12 MRSA §6575-L is enacted to read: 
§6575-L. Temporary medical transfer 
The commissioner may authorize a temporary medical transfer of the elver individual 
fishing quota allocated to a person under section 6505-A in accordance with this section.
