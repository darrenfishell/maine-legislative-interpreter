consolidation.  The successor does not have responsibility for successor asbestos -related 25 
liabilities in excess of this limitation.  26 
2.  Prior merger or consolidation.  If a transferor has assumed or incurred successor 27 
asbestos -related liabilities in connection with a prior merger or consolidation with a prior 28

§194.  Establis hing fair market value of total gross assets  32 
1.  Method.  A successor may establish the fair market value of total gross assets for 33 
the purpose of the limitations under section 193 through any method reasonable under the 34 
circumstances, including:  35 
A.  By re ference to the going concern value of the assets or to the purchase price 36

 Page 3 - 127LR1590(01) -1 
 B.  In the absence of other readily available information from which fair market value 1 
can be determined, by  reference to the value of the assets recorded on a balance sheet.  2 
For purposes of this subsection, "total gross assets" includes intangible assets.  3 
2.  Applicable liability insurance.  To the extent total gross assets include applicable 4 
liability insuranc e that was issued to the transferor whose assets are being valued for 5 
purposes of this section, the applicability, terms, conditions and limits of that insurance 6 
are not affected by this chapter.  This chapter does not otherwise affect the rights and 7 
oblig ations of an insurer, transferor or successor under an insurance contract or any 8 
related agreements, including, without limitation, preenactment settlements resolving 9 
coverage -related disputes, or the rights of an insurer to seek payment for applicable 10 
deductibles, retrospective premiums or self -insured retentions or to seek contribution for 11 
uninsured or self -insured periods or periods when insurance is uncollectible or otherwise 12 
unavailable.  To the extent total gross assets include liability insurance, a settlement of a 13 
dispute concerning the liability insurance coverage entered into by a transferor or 14 
successor with the insurers of the transferor before the effective date of this chapter is 15 
determinative of the total coverage of the liability insurance to  be included in the 16 
calculation of the transferor’s total gross assets.  17 
§195.  Adjustment  18 
1.  Increase.  Except as provided in subsections 2, 3 and 4, for the purposes of this 19 
chapter, the fair market value of total gross assets at the time of a merger or consolidation 20 
increases annually at a rate equal to the sum of:  21 
A.  The prime rate published in the first edition of the Wall Street Journal published 22 
in each calendar year; and  23 
B.  One percent.  24 
2.  Not compounded.  The rate in subsection 1 is not compound ed. 25 
3.  Termination of adjustment.  The adjustment of fair market value of total gross 26 
assets continues as provided under subsection 1 until the date the adjusted value is first 27 
exceeded by the cumulative amounts of successor asbestos -related liabilities p aid or 28 
committed to be paid by or on behalf of the successor or a predecessor or by or on behalf 29 
of a transferor after the time of the merger or consolidation for which the fair market 30 
value of total gross assets is determined.  31 
4.  No adjustment of liabili ty insurance.   No adjustment of the fair market value of 32 
total gross assets pursuant to this section may be applied to any liability insurance 33 
otherwise included in total gross assets under section 194, subsection 2.  34 
§196.  Application  35 
This chapter applies  to all asbestos claims filed against a successor on or after the 36 
effective date of this chapter.  37

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill limits the liability of successor corporations that, before the dangers of 2 
asbestos were known publicly in 1972, acquired or merged with a p redecessor 3 
corporation that engaged in asbestos -related activities.  Liability is capped at the value of 4 
the predecessor corporation at the time of merger adjusted for inflation, but only for 5 
successor corporations that did not continue in the business of mining, selling, 6 
distributing, manufacturing, removing or installing asbestos -containing products.  7
