Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Allowing an alternate payee to begin receiving payment of retirement benefits provided uncler a qualified domestic 
relations order (QDRO) before the retirement of a member of the State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program, 
the Legislative Retirement Program, the Judicial Retirement Program and the Participating Local District Retirement 
Program will not change the manner in which the benefit to the alternate payee is calculated. According to the Maine 
Public Employees Retirement System, because the alternate payee's benefit is determined in accordance with the 
QDRO, the division of benefits is established as part of the order and does not change based on when the benefit 
commences to be paid. However, for any alternate payee that begins to receive retirement benefits earlier than they 
would have under current law, the monthly benefit amount will be lower and will be paid out over a longer period of 
time. There is no net fiscal impact to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System.
