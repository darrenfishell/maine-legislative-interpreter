'C. For the privilege of operating a motor vehicle or camper trailer on the public 
ways, each motor vehicle, other than a stock race car, or each camper trailer to be so 
operated is subject to excise tax as follows, except as specified in subparagraph (3), 
(4) or (5): a sum equal to 24 mills on each dollar of the maker's list purchase price 
for the first or current year of model, a new motor vehicle; and a sum equal to 17 112 
mills on each dollar of the maker's list price for the 2nd year of model, 13 112 mills 
for the 3rd year, 10 mills for the 4th year, 6 1/2 mills for the 5th year and 4 mills for 
the 6th and succeeding years. The minimum tax is $5 for a motor vehicle other than 
a bicycle with motor attached, $2.50 for a bicycle with motor attached, $15 for a 
camper trailer other than a tent trailer and $5 for a tent trailer. The excise tax on a 
stock race car is $5. As used in this paragraph, "new motor vehicle" means a motor

new vehicles for the first year of registration only, the excise tax is based on the purchase 
price of the motor vehicle.

This amendment removes the provision of committee amendment "A" that imposed the motor vehicle excise tax on 
90% of the maker's list price and instead provides that for new vehicles for the first year of registration only, the 
excise tax is based on the purchase price. Subsequent years revert back to the maker's list price. Any General Fund 
revenue loss related to out-of-state vehicles and any Other Special Revenue Funds revenue loss related to collections 
in the unorganized territories would be minor. Therefore, the revenue loss shown in the committee amendment is 
added back in this incremental fiscal note. Likewise, there would be no additional transfer to the Highway Fund, so 
the additional revenue shown in the committee amendment has been reversed. Finally, there would be no 
corresponding reduction in Other Special Revenue Funds allocation and that allocation has been added back as well. 
Excise tax to municipalities is expected to decrease by $4,300,000 with this amendment added versus the $21,000,000 
decrease created by the committee amendment.
