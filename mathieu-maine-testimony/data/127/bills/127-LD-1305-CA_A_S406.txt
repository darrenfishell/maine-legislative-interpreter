interactive mechanism on its publicly accessible website that enables an enrollee to 
request and obtain from the carrier information on the payments made by the carrier to 
network providers for health care services. The interactive mechanism must allow an 
enrollee seeking information about the cost of a particular health care service to compare 
costs among network providers. The amendment allows a carrier that is unable to comply 
to provide a link on its publicly accessible website to enable an enrollee to use the Maine 
Health Data Organization's CompareMaine website. 
The amendment requires health insurance carriers beginning January 1, 2018 to 
provide a good faith estimate, within a reasonable time of a request, of the estimated 
amount of the out-of-pocket costs to be paid by the enrollee for a proposed nonemergency 
procedure or service from a network provider. The amendment defines a nonemergency 
procedure or service as a procedure or service in one of the following 7 categories: office 
visits; physical and occupational therapy services; integrative medicine services; mental 
health services; obstetrical and gynecological services; radiology and imaging services;
