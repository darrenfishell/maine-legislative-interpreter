 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §3128 -A, sub -§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 34, §1, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
3.  Duration.   The order continues in effect for one year or until the obligor finds 4 
work, whichev er occurs first . 5 
Sec. 2.  19-A MRSA §2001, sub -§5, ¶D, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 6 
and affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:  7 
D.  Gross income may include the difference between the amount a party is earning 8 
and that party's earning capaci ty when the party voluntarily becomes or remains 9 
unemployed or underemployed, if sufficient evidence is introduced concerning a 10 
party's current earning capacity.  In the absence of evidence in the record to the 11 
contrary, a party that is personally providin g primary care for a child under the age of 12 
3 years  6 months  is deemed not available for employment.  The court shall consider 13 
anticipated child care and other work -related expenses in determining whether to 14 
impute income, or how much income to impute, to a party providing primary care to 15 
a child between the ages of 3 6 months  and 12 years.  A party who is incarcerated in a 16 
correctional or penal institution is deemed available only for employment that is 17 
available through such institutions.  18 
Sec. 3.  19-A MR SA §2006, sub -§5, ¶A, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 19 
and affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:  20 
A.  When the parent who is not the primary care provider is legally obligated to 21 
support a child in that party's household other than the child fo r whom a support order 22 
is being sought, an adjustment must be made to that party's parental support 23 
obligation.  The adjustment is made by using the nonprimary residential care 24 
provider's annual gross income to compute a theoretical support obligation unde r the 25 
support guidelines for each child in that household.  Neither the child support 26 
received by nor the financial contributions of the other parent of each child in the 27 
household are considered in the theoretical support calculation.  The obligation is 28 
then subtracted from the annual gross income, and the adjusted income is the amount 29 
used to calculate support.  The adjustment is used in all appropriate cases , except 30 
when the result would be a reduction in an award previously established . 31 
Sec. 4.  19-A MR SA §2302, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 2001, c. 255, §1, is 32 
repealed.  33 
Sec. 5.  19-A MRSA §2652, sub -§6, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and 34 
affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:  35 
6.  Fees.   A notice to the obligor and payor of income that the payo r of income shall 36 
withhold and send to the department a fee of $2 per week  pay period  in addition to the 37 
amount withheld for child support.  38

another state that assumed jurisdiction pursua nt to the Uniform Interstate Family Support 10 
Act, a tribunal of the this State:  11 
Sec. 9.  19-A MRSA §3311, sub -§4-A is enacted to read:  12 
4-A.  Foreign central authority.  "Foreign central authority" means the entity 13 
designated by a foreign country as defined in section 2802, subsection 3 -A to perform the 14

SUMMARY  16 
This bill amends laws concerning the collection of child support obligations.  It 17 
removes from the duration of an order to seek work the provision "or until the o bligor 18 
finds work."  It changes the time frame in which a primary care provider of a child is 19 
deemed to be unavailable for employment from 3 years to the first 6 months of the child's 20 
life.  It allows, when appropriate, an adjustment of child support oblig ations for a child in 21 
the party's household other than the child for whom a support order is being sought, even 22 
if that adjustment results in a reduction of a previously established award.  It repeals the 23 
automatic suspension of the child support obligatio n of assisted obligors, and it corrects 24 
an inconsistency in amounts withheld from an obligor's withholding from $2 per week to 25 
$2 per pay period.  26
