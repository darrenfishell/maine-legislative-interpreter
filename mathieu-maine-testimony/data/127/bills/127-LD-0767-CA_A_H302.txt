This legislation provides an exception to the Pine Tred, Development Zone program for call centers located in 
Aroostook or Washington counties. If such a call center were to become certified under the program, it would receive 
the 80% employee tax increment financing, income tax credit, the sales tax exemption for personal property and the 
sales tax reimbursement for real property allowed under the program. The potential revenue reduction to the State 
would depend on the specifics of any call centers that qualify for the program and no estimate is made at this time. 
Additional costs to the Depmiment of Economic and Community Development associated with making the requiTed 
certifications can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
