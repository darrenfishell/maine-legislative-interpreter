SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill to clarify the language regarding damages for the 
unlawful cutting of trees. 
The amendment makes a distinction between the unlawful cutting of trees in areas 
zoned for residential use and the unlawful cutting of trees in other areas. It also makes a 
distinction between the unlawful cutting of ornamental or fruit trees and the unlawful 
cutting of all other trees. 
If a person cuts down or damages trees without permission on land the person does 
not own, the person is liable to the owner for damages. 
The amendment makes it clear that the owner of land that is not zoned for residential 
use may choose how damages are measured. The owner may choose to have the damages

calculated based on: the market value of the lost trees; the diminution in value of the real 
estate as a whole resulting from the unlawful cutting of the trees; the forfeiture amounts 
determined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17, section 2510, subsections 2 and 3; or, 
if the lost trees are ornamental or fruit trees, the costs of replacing, replanting and 
restoring the trees with trees of comparable size and the same or equivalent species and 
the actual costs for cleanup of damage caused during the cutting. If the trees are not 
ornamental or fruit trees, the owner may claim in addition the costs for regeneration of 
the stand in accordance with Title 12, section 8869. The court may reduce the damages 
awarded for good cause shown when the cutting of trees was done negligently or without 
fault. 
The amendment further provides that the owner of land that is zoned for residential 
use may choose how damages are measured. The owner may choose to have the damages 
calculated based on: the market value of the lost trees; the diminution in value of the real 
estate as a whole resulting from the unlawful cutting of the trees; the forfeiture amounts 
determined in Title 17, section 2510, subsections 2 and 3; or, regardless of whether the 
lost :trees are ornamental or fruit trees, the costs of replacing, replanting and restoring the 
trees with trees of comparable size and the same or equivalent species and the actual costs 
for cleanup of damage caused during the cutting. 
Current law establishes recoverable damages based on the manner in which the 
owner has claimed damages and multiplied by 2 if the uniawful cutting was negligent or 
without fault, and multiplied by 3 if the person acted intentionally or knowingly. This 
amendment authorizes an additional award of punitive damages if the person acted with 
malice. 
The amendment deletes the cap on the recovery of costs of professional services for 
asserting a claim, including attorney's fees. It also repeals a reference to interest on 
damages because the current general law allows the award of prejudgment and post­
judgment interest in all cases as provided in Title 14, sections 1602-B and 1602-C, 
respectively. 
The amendment provides that public utilities and their contractors are not liable for 
damages when the cutting or removal of trees is necessary to improve the safety and 
reliability of the public utilities' delivery of products and services.
