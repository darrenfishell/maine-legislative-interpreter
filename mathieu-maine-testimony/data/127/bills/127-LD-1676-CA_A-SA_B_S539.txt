(2) Provides in-state benefits, such as capital investments to improve long-term 
viability of the facility, permanent direct jobs, payments to municipalities, 
payments for fuel harvested in the State, payment for in-state resource access, in­
state purchases of goods and services and construction-related jobs and 
purchases; 
(3) Reduces greenhouse gas emissions; 
(4) Promotes fuel diversity; and 
(5) Supports or improves grid reliability. 
In selecting among bids, the commission shall determine the total in-state economic 
benefits of the contract in an expected annual dollar per megawatt-hour average and the 
cost to fund the above-market costs of a contract in an expected annual dollar per 
megawatt-hour average. The commission shall consider both of these values for each 
proposal to identify those proposals that maxiimize the overall benefits to the State, and 
shall establish a process under which a gene:rator of biomass resources verifies on an 
annual basis that the projected in-state economic benefits are generated during the term of 
the contract. If the commission conclude:s that the solicitation conducted under 
subsection 2 is not competitive, no bidders may be selected and the commission is not 
obligated to enter into a contract. If the commission finds the in-state benefits are not 
being achieved, the commission may reduce the contract payment by the percentage 
difference between actual in-state benefits achieved and the projected in-state benefits.'

lines 41 to 43 and page 3, lines I to 9 in amendment) and inserting the following:

cost recovery fund, referred to in this section as "the fund." The fund receives funds 
allocated or transferred by the Legislature from the unappropriated surplus of the General 
Fund in accordance with subsection 8. The commission shall use the fund to pay all 
above-market costs of any contract entered into under this section. No more than 50% of 
the fund may be awarded to facilities serving the NMISA region. At the close of fiscal 
year 2016-17, amounts remaining in the cost recovery fund that the commission has 
determined are not needed to pay above-market costs in accordance with subsection 6 
must be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund established under the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 1532. The commission by rule or order shall establish 
how above-market costs are determined and how payments from the fund are made. 
6. Cost recovery. The commission shall ensure that all costs and benefits associated 
with contracts entered into under this section are allocated as follows: 
A. All costs, other than above-market costs, and all direct financial benefits 
associated with contracts entered into under this section must be allocated to 
ratepayers in accordance with the Maine Re:vised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-F 
and may not be considered imprudent; and 
B. Above-market costs, including any price differential existing at any time during 
the term of the contract between the contract price and the prevailing market price at 
which the capacity resource is sold and any losses derived from contracts for 
differences, must be paid from the fund.'

SUMMARY 
This amendment: 
1 . Adds an emergency preamble and clause; 
2. Requires that a biomass resource facility is operating at least at a 50% capacity for 
60 days rather than 6 months prior to initiation of the competitive solicitation; 
3. Provides that if the Public Utilities Commission concludes that the solicitation is 
not competitive, no bidders may be selected; 
4. Removes language that requires the Public Utilities Commission to conduct a 
competitive solicitation for a combined heat and power solicitation; and 
5. Eliminates cost recovery through the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund and instead 
directs the State Controller at the close of fiscal year 2015-16 to transfer from the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund up to $13,400,000 to the cost recovery fund 
established for this purpose. At the close of fiscal year 2016-17, amounts remaining in 
the cost recovery fund that the commission has determined are not needed to pay above­
market costs must be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund established 
under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, section 1532.

This amendment eliminates the $6,700,000 transfer from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund to the Cost Recovery Fund within the 
Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in both fiscal year 2016-17 and 2017-18 and instead directs $13,400,000 to be transferred from the 
unappropriated surplus of the General Fund at the close of fiscal year 2015-16 following certain statutorily required transfers (the so­
called "cascade"). There is no guarantee that there will be sufficient funds from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to make 
this transfer. The amendment allows up to 50% of funds within the Cost Recovery Fund to go to facilities serving the Northern Maine 
Independent System Administrator region. This amendment also allows the PUC to not enter into any contract if a determination from 
the PUC is made that none of the bids are competitive. The amendment requires any funds remaining in the Cost Recovery Fund at the 
close of fiscal year 2016-17 be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The amendment also adds an emergency preamble and clause, as well as eliminates the requirement that the PUC conduct a solicitation 
to procure certain energy.
