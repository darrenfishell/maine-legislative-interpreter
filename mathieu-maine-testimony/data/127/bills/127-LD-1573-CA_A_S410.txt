Fiscal Note 
Current biennium savings -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Current biennium revenue decrease -Other Special Revenue Funds 
The bill provides an exception to the certificate of need requirement for a health care facility in certain cases of 
change in ownership. This will reduce the number of certificate of need application requests, reducing Other Special ~' 
Revenue Funds revenue from application fees. With fewer certificates of need to process, the Department of Health 
and Human Services will incur Other Special Revenue Funds cost savings. No estimate is made of the amount of any 
revenue decrease or of co~t savings at this time, but giv~n that the fees were designed to offset the costs, any net fiscal 
impact to the program is not expected to be significant.
