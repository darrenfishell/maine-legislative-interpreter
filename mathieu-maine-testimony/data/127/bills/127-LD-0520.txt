 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, properly disposing of automobiles that have reached the end of their 3 
useful lives is in th e best interest of Maine's environment and aesthetics; and  4 
Whereas, the inconsistency between Maine and neighboring jurisdictions in the 5 
certificate of title requirements for automobiles destined for junk and scrap metal disposal 6 
has caused a loss of emplo yment and income to Maine residents and income tax revenue 7 
to the State; and  8 
Whereas, to reduce the loss of employment, income and revenue, it is imperative 9 
that this legislation take effect as soon as possible; and  10 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislat ure, these facts create an emergency within 11 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 12 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 13 
therefore,  14
