 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the soft shell clam and marine worm industries are vital to Maine's coastal 3 
economy; and  4 
Whereas, cooperation of the soft shell clam and marine worm industries and other 5 
interested parties is needed to develop predator control strategies to mitigate the effects of 6 
green crabs; and  7 
Whereas, the soft shell clam and marine worm industries have an economic interest 8 
in properly managing the intertidal zone in a way that does not disadvantage either user 9 
group; and  10 
Whereas, green crabs are thought to exert adverse impact on juvenile soft shell 11 
clams and the intertidal zone, and research is needed to u nderstand and respond to the 12 
effects of green crabs on the intertidal zone; and  13 
Whereas, green crabs are invasive and are causing immediate damage, and the 14 
municipal predator control pilot project as well as the authority of municipalities to 15 
remove green crabs from predator control project areas expire February 28, 2015; and  16 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 17 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 18
