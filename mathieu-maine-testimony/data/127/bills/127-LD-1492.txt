 SUMMARY  1 
This bill removes the Common Core State Standards Initiative standards from the 2 
system of learning results at the end of the 2016 -2017 school year.  For the 2016 -2017 3 
school  year, as an alternative to the core of standards in English language arts and 4 
mathematics for kindergarten to grade 12 established in common with the other states, the 5 
bill allows a school administrative unit to administer the statewide system of learning  6 
results standards that were in effect prior to April 12, 2010.  It requires the Department of 7 
Education, with input from a stakeholder group, to develop new statewide content 8 
standards for use beginning with the 2017 -2018 school year and to submit provisi onally 9 
adopted major substantive rules to the Legislature by January 2, 2017.  It requires the 10 
Department of Education to develop and adopt assessments for elementary and secondary 11 
schools in English language arts and mathematics that are aligned with the new content 12 
standards for use beginning with the 2017 -2018 school year.  The bill also requires the 13 
Department of Education to establish accountability standards at all grade levels in the 14 
area of social studies.  15
