2. Evaluation of request for extension. The commissioner may approve an 
extension of one or more of the predator control pilot projects authorized in 2014 in the 
towns of Brunswick, Freeport, Harpswell and West Bath. An extension may be granted 
solely for the purpose of further evaluating or developing predator controls. In making a 
determination whether to authorize extension of a predator control pilot project, the 
commissioner shall consider whether the project will measure the survival of soft shell 
clam seed after the 2014 predator control pilot projects, whether the project will explore 
continued predator control methods and whether the project will investigate control 
methods for predators other than green crabs. A municipality shall indicate when an 
extended predator control pilot project will terminate; however, in no event may a 
predator control pilot project continue beyond November 1, 2016. 
3. Prohibition on seeding in extended pilot projects. A predator control pilot 
project authorized for extension under this section may not enhance the predator control 
project area with hatchery stock or transplants of wild seed during the period of the 
extension. 
4. Marking. A municipality with a predator control pilot project authorized for 
extension under this section shall clearly mark the boundaries of the predator control 
project area with unifonn marking approved by the Department of Marine Resources and 
post signs that include the words "approved predator control project" and "no harvesting 
of marine organisms is allowed within these boundaries." 
5. Maintenance of predator control gear. A municipality shall maintain all gear 
approved as part of a predator control pilot project in good working condition. In a 
request to the commissioner for an extension of a predator control pilot project under this 
section, the municipality shall provide a weekly maintenance plan. The commissioner 
may terminate the muncipality's predator control pilot project and order the removal of all 
gear if the commissioner determines that the municipality has failed to follow the 
maintenance plan provided under this subsection. 
6. Notice. A municipality with a predator control pilot project authorized for 
extension under this section shall provide adequate public notice to harvesters of soft 
shell clams and marine worms of the areas that have been closed to harvesting. This 
notice must include, but is not limited to, notice in local newspapers and on publicly 
accessible websites of the municipality, copies mailed to all marine worm dealers and 
signs posted at water access sites. 
7. Report. A municipality with a predator control pilot project authorized for 
extension under this section shall provide a written report and oral presentation of 
activities and results to the Department of Marine Resources no later than January 31, 
2017 and shall participate in a workshop related to the requirements of this section that is 
sponsored by the department.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment enacts a provision of law with substantially the same language as a 
law that was repealed on February 28, 2015, which prohibited the harvesting of marine 
organisms from within a municipal predator control project area, except for municipal 
removal of green crabs. The provision of law has a repeal date of November 1, 2016.
