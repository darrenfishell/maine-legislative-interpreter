engage in retail sales and that do not require, as a condition of employment, that their 5 
employees work on Sundays.  If an employer decreases the average weekly work 6

evidence that the employer has required Sunday work as a condition of employment 8 
in violation of this section, unless the employer and employee agreed that the 9 
employee would work on Sundays when the employee was initially hired.  In no 10 
event, however, may any store having more than 5,000  10,000  square feet of interior 11 
customer selling space be open on Easter Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day 12 
unless that store is operated and staffed only by the owner or a member of the owner's 13

brother or half -sister of the owner's spouse or the spouse of the owner's half -brother 19 
or half -sister.  20
