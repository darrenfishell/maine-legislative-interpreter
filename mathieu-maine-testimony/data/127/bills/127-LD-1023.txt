SUMMARY  19 
This bill amends the definition of "animal shelter" to include animal rescue and 20 
applies that expanded definition to the laws de aling with animal shelters.  This bill 21 
repeals the definition of "warrant," as municipal warrants were repealed in Public Law 22 
2009, chapter 343, section 19.  The bill also transfers the responsibility for the costs of 23 
maintaining seized animals from the De partment of Agriculture, Conservation, and 24 
Forestry to the person who seized the animals.  The bill corrects an error made in 2007, 25 
when the Legislature changed dog licensing and recording fees in the Maine Revised 26 
Statutes, Title 7, section 3923 -A but did  not change a similar provision in Title 7, section 27 
3942.  This bill provides that small animals can be euthanized if sick or injured.  This bill 28 
repeals the conditional animal shelter license law that was enacted in 2013.  This bill 29 
clarifies that a perso n may not dispose of a deceased domesticated animal on public 30 
property or on private property without permission from the landowner.  31
