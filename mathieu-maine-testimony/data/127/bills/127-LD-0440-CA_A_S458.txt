enhance its ability to perform an examination ordered pursuant to subsection 1, 2, 3 
or 9, the State Forensic Service shall so advise the court. The State Forensic Service 
may make this determination based upon consultation with the defendant's attorney 
and the attorney for the State and the court and upon such other information as it 
determines appropriate. In addition, the State Forensic Service may include such a 
determination in a report to the court that recommends further evaluation of the 
defendant. 
B. Upon a determination by the State Forensic Service under paragraph A, a court 
having jurisdiction in a criminal case may commit the defendant to the custody of the 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services for placement in a secure, therapeutic 
mental health unit, in a state mental health institute, in an appropria-te alternative 
institution that is appropriate for the care and treatment of people with mental illness 
or in an appropriate residential program that provides care and treatment for persons 
who have intellectual disabilities or autism for observation for a period not to exceed 
60 days. If the State Forensic Service requires additional time for observation, it 
shall communicate its request and the reasons for that request to the court and to 
counsel for the parties. The court shall accommodate a party's request to be heard on 
the issue of whether an extension should be granted and may extend the commitment 
for up to an additional 90 days. Unless the defendant objects, an order under this 
paragraph must authorize the secure, therapeutic mental health unit, state mental 
health institute, institution or residential program where the defendant is placed by 
the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to provide treatment to the 
defendant. When further observation of the defendant is determined no longer 
necessary by the State Forensic Service, the commissioner shall report that 
determination to the court and the court shall terminate the commitment. If the 
defendant had been incarcerated prior to the commitment for observation and if, 
during the period of observation, the defendant presents a substantial risk of causing 
bodily injury to staff or others that cannot be managed in an appropriate state mental 
health institute, in an institution for the care and treatment of people with mental 
illness or in an appropriate residential program that provides care and treatment for 
persons who have intellectual disabilities or autism, the commissioner ma-y remm the 
Ele:ieaaaat to the eorreetioaal faeility shall commit the defendant to a secure, 
therapeutic mental health unit. The commissioner shall report the risk management 
issues to the court. Upon receiving the report, the court shall review the report and 
may enter any order authorized by this section, including termination of the 
commitment.

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment does the 
following. 
1. It retains the provisions of the bill that establish a secure, therapeutic mental health 
unit for defendants undergoing court-ordered assessments to determine their competency 
to stand trial or their criminal culpability, to provide therapeutic care for forensic patients 
and to provide care for jail inmates who meet the criteria for involuntary civil 
commitment under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-B, chapter 3. The amendment 
directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish one or more units. 
2. It adds to the laws governing the placement process a requirement for a 
determination by a court that a secure, therapeutic mental health unit is appropriate for 
the defendant. 
3. It assigns responsibility for operation of a secure, therapeutic mental health unit to 
the Commissioner of Health and Human Services and allows contracts with multiple jails 
for multiple secure, therapeutic mental health units. It specifies that staffing must be 
dedicated to the units, that staff must be trained, who may provide the training, that a unit 
must be separated from the general jail population at all times and that the Department of 
Health and Human Services and the county sheriff for the county in which a unit is 
located must work to obtain and maintain any federal certification that is required or 
available and through which funding may be secured for the unit. 
4. It directs the Department of Health and Human Services, by January 15, 2017, 
after consultation with the county sheriff of a county in which a secure, therapeutic 
mental health unit is located, to submit a report to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over criminal justice matters regarding the operations of 
the units. The report must include data on population, length of stay, staffing and 
services. The report must also include recommendations regarding the reallocation of 
resources for the units, the designs of the units, the provisions of forensic services at the 
Riverview Psychiatric Center and the units and the transfer provisions of Title 34-A, 
sections 3069, 3069-A and 3069-B.

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to establish one or more Secure Mental 
Health Units within county jails or regional jails for the purpose of providing observation, mental health evaluation 
for the purposes of detennining competency or criminal responsibility, risk assessments and therapeutic mental health 
care for certain eligible individuals. For comparison, the DHHS ctmently has a contract with an out of state provider 
to provide this service to similar individuals at a cost of $494 per bed per day. It is not !mown at this time how many 
units would be created, how many total beds would be needed, what staffing levels would be or when these units 
would be created. Thus, no estimate of the increased cost can be made at this time. 
The bill also requires the DHHS, in consultation with any county sheriffs impacted, to submit a report to the 
legislature regarding the current operations of the units and reconm1endations for optimal operations of the units. Any 
additional costs to the DHHS to consult with the Sheriffs and create and submit the report and recommendations are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
