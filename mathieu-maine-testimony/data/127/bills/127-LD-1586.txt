Sec. A -1.  1 MRSA §403 -A is enacted to read:  3 
§403 -A.  Public proceedings through other means of communication  4 
1.  Requirements.  A body, except a publicly elected body, subject to this su bchapter 5 
may conduct a public proceeding through telephonic, video, electronic or other similar 6 
means of communication only if the following requirements are met:  7 
A.  The body has adopted a written policy that authorizes a member of the body who 8 
is not phy sically present to participate in a public proceeding. The policy must 9 
establish criteria that must be met before a member may participate when not 10 
physically present. The policy may not allow a member who is not physically present 11 
to participate in an exe cutive session;  12 
B.  Notice of the public proceeding has been given in accordance with section 406;  13 
C.  A quorum of the body is assembled physically at the location identified in the 14 
notice required by section 406, except that a body may convene a public pr oceeding 15 
by telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means of communication without a 16 
quorum if:  17 
(1)  An emergency has been declared in accordance with Title 22, section 802, 18 
subsection 2 -A or Title 37 -B, section 742;  19 
(2)  The public proceeding is ne cessary to take action to address the emergency; 20 
and 21 
(3)  The body otherwise complies with the provisions of this section to the extent 22 
practicable based on the circumstances of the emergency;  23 
D.  Each member of the body who is participating in the public proceeding is able to 24 
hear all the other members and speak to all the other members during the public 25 
proceeding, and members of the public attending the public proceeding in the 26 
location identified in the notice required by section 406 are able to hear al l members 27 
participating from other locations;  28

SUMMARY  9 
Part A of this bill allows members of a body subject to the Freedom of Access Ac t to 10 
participate in meetings of the body through telephonic, video, electronic or other similar 11 
means of communication under certain conditions; however, the bill does not allow 12 
members of publicly elected bodies to participate in public proceedings unless  physically 13 
present. The body must have adopted a written policy authorizing remote participation 14 
with criteria that must be met before a member may participate remotely, but the policy 15 
may not allow a member to participate remotely in an executive session  of the body. The 16 
bill also requires that notice of the proceeding must be given as if no members were 17 
participating remotely, each member of the body must be able to hear and speak to all 18 
other members, members of the public must be able to hear all membe rs of the body, each 19 
member participating remotely must identify anyone else present at the location from 20 
which the member is participating, documents or materials discussed or presented at the 21 
proceeding must have been received by or transmitted to member s participating remotely 22 
and all votes must be taken by roll call vote. A member who is not physically present may 23 
not vote in a quasi -judicial proceeding of the body. A quorum of the body must be 24 
physically present unless an emergency has been declared an d the proceeding is 25 
necessary to address the emergency. If the body conducts proceedings with members 26 
participating remotely, the body must also hold at least one proceeding annually where no 27 
members participate remotely.  28 
Under current law, the following s tate agencies are authorized to use remote -access 29 
technology to conduct meetings: the Finance Authority of Maine, the Commission on 30 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, the Emergency Medical Services' Board and 31 
the Workers' Compensation Board. Part B provides a specific exemption from the new 32 
requirements for the Emergency Medical Services' Board and the Workers' Compensation 33 
Board and does not affect the existing authority of those agencies or the Finance 34 
Authority of Maine or the Commission on Gove rnmental Ethics and Election Practices to 35 
use remote -access technology to conduct meetings.  36
