SUMMARY  30 
This bill repeals the current law concerning consent for a minor's abortion.  31 
This bill requires the written consent of a parent or legal guardian bef ore an abortion 32 
may be performed on a minor or an incapacitated person. Consent may be given in certain 33 
circumstances by a brother or sister who is at least 21 years of age or by a stepparent or a 34 
grandparent. Consent is not required in a medical emergency . The Probate Court or 35 
District Court may issue an order for the purpose of consenting to the abortion in 2 36 
circumstances. First, the court may waive the need for 3rd -party consent if it finds by 37 
clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is both su fficiently mature and 38 
well-informed to decide whether to have an abortion. Second, the court may waive the 39 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR0370(01) -1 
 need for 3rd -party consent if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that there is 1 
a pattern of physical or sexual abuse or neglect of the petitioner by one or both of her 2 
parents or her guardian or that notification of a parent or guardian is not in the best 3 
interests of the petitioner.  4
