read:  3 
ยง6304.  Automated external defibrillators and cardiopulmonary resuscitation  4 
School boards may place automated ext ernal defibrillators in occupied school 5 
buildings and at school athletic events.  School personnel and members of the public may 6 
receive training on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use automated 7 
external defibrillators in order to acquire the skills and confidence to respond to 8 
emergencies.  In accordance with rules adopted by the department, public schools shall 9 
offer training to students on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use 10 
automated external defibrillators.  Rules adop ted under this section are routine technical 11 
rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 12 
Sec. 2.  Standards for instruction in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 13 
automated external defibrillator use.  The Commissioner of Education shall 14 
establ ish, by rule, standards for instruction in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or "CPR," 15 
and automated external defibrillator, or "AED," use pursuant to the Maine Revised 16 
Statutes, Title 20 -A, section 6304.  The commissioner shall base the standards for 17 
instruc tion in CPR and AED use on the programs established by the American Heart 18 
Association or the American Red Cross or another program that is nationally recognized 19 
and uses the most current national evidence -based emergency cardiovascular guidelines 20 
and incor porates psychomotor skills development into the instruction.  The standards for 21 
instruction in AED use may not require the use of an AED but must include an 22 
explanation of AED use.  A licensed teacher may not be required to be certified as a CPR 23 
or AED tra iner or to facilitate, provide or oversee CPR or AED instruction.  The rule 24 
must require that a course that results in CPR and AED certification must be taught by a 25 
certified CPR or AED instructor.  The rule must be designed to ensure that the 26 
requirements  of Title 20 -A, section 6304 can be met by a public school without the public 27 
school's being required to expand or modify its activity so as to necessitate additional 28 
expenditures from local revenues.  29
