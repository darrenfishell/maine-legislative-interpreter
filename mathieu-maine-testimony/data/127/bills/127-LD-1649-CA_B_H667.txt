A. Net energy billing of municipal accounts designated by a municipality with 
respect to the energy produced by a distributed energy resource with a nameplate 
capacity ofup to 5 megawatts owned by that municipality; and 
B. Net energy billing of a distributed energy resource with a nameplate capacity of 
up to one megawatt, against the accounts of up to 50 customers who have an 
ownership interest in the distributed energy resource, as long as each customer's 
proportional interest in the distributed energy resource represents at least one kilowatt 
of the resource's generating capacity. 
The commission shall allow any distributed energy resource for which net energy billing 
is allowed under paragraph A or B to be used to offset part or all of each net energy 
billing customer's electricity requirements.

to determine whether net energy billing should continue or be modified, after finding that 
an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility's cumulative capacity of 
generating facilities subject to rules adopted pursuant to this section reached 1 % or more 
of that utility's peak demand, the commission shall retain an independent consultant 
experienced in net energy billing systems to assist in the commission's review of: 
A. The effect on industry jobs, stability and net energy billing customer investments 
that the changes could have;

Potential current biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC)-to adopt rules allowing net energy billing for certain 
customers of an investor-owned transmission and distribution utility. This bill requires the PUC to retain an 
independent consultant experienced in net energy billing systems if the PUC finds that an investor-owned 
transmission and distribution utility's cumulative capacity of generating facilities reached 1 % or more of that utility's 
peak demand. Were this to happen, the PUC would require an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $100,97 4 
annually and would increase annual assessments by the same amount to fund these consulting costs.
