15 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A ., to S.P. 144, L.D. 376 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment replaces 
the bill, which proposes to require funds generated by forfeited firearms that are 
auctioned to federally licensed firearms dealers or the public to be used to fund drug 
abuse resistance education programs. The amendment imposes a surcharge of $10 on all 
fines imposed by a court under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17 -A, chapter 45, the 
laws on illegal possession of drugs. The amendment requires that the revenues trom the 
surcharges be deposited in the DARE Fund to be used to fund DARE programs in 
schools. "DARE" is defined as an educational program taught by law enforcement 
officers to students in kindergarten to grade 12 that targets prevention of substance abuse, 
violence or high-risk behavior and teaches students good decision-making skills to help 
them to lead safe and healthy lives. The amendment also adds an appropriations and 
allocations section.

This legislation establishes the DARE Education Fund within the Office of Treasurer of State and provides an Other 
Special Revenue Funds allocation of $125 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $286 in fiscal year 2016-17 which represents 1 % 
of the projected revenue. 
This bill also includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $12,420 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $28,319 in 
fiscal year 2016-17 to establish the DARE Education Reimbursement Fund within the Department of Education to 
reimburse local school districts for the costs associated with providing DARE programs to their students. 
The Department of Education has indicated that it does not have staff available to oversee the reimbursement fund. 
Until the volume of work associated with implementing the requirements of this legislation are known, it is unclear as 
to whether the department can administer the fund within existing resources without impacting other programs and 
services.
