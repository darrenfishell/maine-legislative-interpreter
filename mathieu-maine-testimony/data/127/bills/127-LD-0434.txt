 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §156, 5th ¶, as amended by PL 1999, c. 633, §1 and affected 2 
by §3, is further amended to read:  3 
In a case involving multiparty defendants, each defendant is jointly and severally  4 
liable to the plaintiff for the full amount of the plaintiff's damages . However, any , except 5 
that, if a defendant is less than 50% at fault, that defendant’s liability is several and not 6 
joint and the defendant is liable for only the amount of the damages  attributable to that 7 
defendant.  This limitation on liability also applies in any claim for contribution or action 8 
brought by another defendant.  A  defendant has the right through the use of special 9 
interrogatories to request of the jury the percentage of  fault contributed by each 10 
defendant.  If a defendant is released by the plaintiff under an agreement that precludes 11 
the plaintiff from collecting against remaining parties that portion of any damages 12 
attributable to the released defendant's share of respo nsibility, then the following rules 13 
apply.  14 
SUMMARY  15 
Under current Maine law, if 2 or more defendants are found to be liable to a plaintiff 16 
for the same injury, the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of 17 
the plaintiff’s damages.  18 
This bill provides that, if a defendant is less than 50% at fault for the plaintiff’s 19 
injury, that defendant’s liability for damages is equal to the percentage attributable to that 20 
defendant.  This limitation also applies to claims for contribution and acti ons brought by 21 
another defendant.  22
