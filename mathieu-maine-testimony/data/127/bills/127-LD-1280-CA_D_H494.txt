the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Gambling Control 
Board for a casino operator license. The fee to submit a bid is $250,000. The 
amendment provides for specific supporting information to be submitted by the bidder 
and considered by the commission including the bidder's ability to make a minimum 
$250,000,000 capital investment in the resort-style casino and information regarding job 
creation, economic development and plans to mitigate negative infrastructure impacts. 
Under the amendment, the commission is directed to develop a point system for the 
factors to be considered and give priority to factors that create jobs, promote economic 
development, increase tourism and support a casino that fits the character of the State. 
The winning bidder must enter into a contract with the commission that obligates the 
casino operator to abide by the proposals made in the winning bid. Failure to abide by 
the terms of the contract could result in financial penalties to the operator. 
The license fee for a casino under the amendment is $50,000,000, of which 
$5,000,000 is deposited with the Gambling Control Board and $15,000,000 is deposited 
into the General Fund. The remaining $30,000,000 is deposited into an account to be 
used to mitigate the impact of lost revenue on the municipalities and a county in which 
casinos are currently located. If an existing casino closes, the Gambling Control Board 
will distribute money from the account to the municipalities and county based on 
distributions the municipality or county had been receiving from the casino. 
If a person initially licensed to operate the casino surrenders the license or the license 
is revoked, a subsequent licensee may operate the casino only for the remainder of the 
license term and is subject to a $500,000 transfer fee. A subsequent licensee is subject to 
the contract executed when the casino in either York County or Cumberland County was 
initially licensed. 
The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine revenue at 40% and the 
distribution of net table game revenue at 16% for the resort-style casino. Upon 
commencement of table game operations at a casino in York County or Cumberland 
County, a single distribution of slot machine and table game revenue will be applied to all 
casinos in the State. The amendment authorizes the Joint Standing Committee on 
Veterans and Legal Affairs to submit legislation developing this distribution of revenue 
and provides a list of funds and programs that are required to be included in that 
distribution. 
Finally, the amendment makes enactment of this bill contingent upon the approval of 
the voters of the State at a statewide referendum held in November 2016.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill creates a commission to u!>e a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino. Bidders will 
pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The fiscal note assumes this will be credited to the 
General Fund. The Gambling Control Board (GCB) will accept applications for a casino license in either York County 
or Cumberland County for the winning bidder as long as the voters of the municipality where the proposed casino will 
be located have voted to approve a casino and the voters ofthe county have not rejected a casino. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 40% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill would 
require this casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital improvements to 
the casino using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct those funds to the GCB. This 
fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the GCB. This fiscal note assumes a total of 1,000 slot 
machines and 24 table games, generating an estimated $28,893,809 annually in Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) 
revenue. 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license is 
$50,000,000, with $15,000,000 going to the General Fund and $35,000,000 going into an OSRF account within the 
GCB. $30,000,000 from this license fee will be used to maintain the level of revenue distributed to municipalities and 
counties receiving money from either Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino. This $30,000,000 will be transferred to the 
Department of Transportation, Highway and Bridge Capital Program if Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino continue 
to operate and provide revenue to host municipalities and counties. If either Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino 
ceases operations within 5 years of commencement of the new casino, then distribution will be made from the OSRF 
account to compensate host municipalities and counties until the entire $30,000,000 is distributed. A one-time renewal 
fee of $250,000 will be due 20 years after this new casino commences operations. The GCB will generate annual 
OSRF revenue of $102,400 from registration fees. Annual State costs associated with 5 inspectors, an auditor and other 
related expenses are estimated to be $523,510. 
LRi 572(05) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
WhiteSand Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in revenue to . 
Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to open. This fiscal note assumes the same 20% reduction, 
resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of $347,495 and OSRF revenue loss of $5,41 0,437. An 
ass~ssment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood Casino has not been done at this time. 
Under current law, State revenue from both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino go to various funds, but this bill 
directs all State revenue from these casinos to go to the Gambling Co~trol Board until a distribution of slot machine 
and table game revenue is established by the Legislature. The new distribution is required to be a uniform distribution 
of slot machine and table game revenue for each casino, slot machine facility or gambling facility. This will reduce 
General Fund revenue by an estimated $8,223,744 annually.
