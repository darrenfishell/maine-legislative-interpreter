Fiscal Note 
Minor savings -General Fund 
This bill would change the process to get certain county offices on the general election ballot from nomination by 
primary election to nomination by petition, thereby reducing the number of offices on the primary ballots and the 
number of ballot styles needed for each party. This would result in minor General Fund savings not requiring any 
change to the budget to the Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions for ballot printing costs.
