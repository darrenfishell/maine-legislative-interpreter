SUMMARY  10 
This bill implements the recommendations of the working group create d under 11 
Resolve 2009, chapter 68, which reviewed employment bans based on criminal 12 
convictions, the rational basis for the employment ban and the length of the employment 13 
ban prohibiting an individual from working as a certified nursing assistant or unlice nsed 14 
assistive person.  15 
It prohibits the employment of a certified nursing assistant who, while working as a 16 
certified nursing assistant, was the subject of a complaint investigation by the division of 17 
licensing and regulatory services within the Department  of Health and Human Services, 18 
which is the designated state survey agency pursuant to federal law, that resulted in a 19 
substantiated complaint that was placed as a notation on the Maine Registry of Certified 20 
Nursing Assistants and Direct Care Workers or re ceived a disqualifying criminal 21 
conviction that was placed as a notation on the registry or has any disqualifying criminal 22 
conviction.  It prohibits the employment of an unlicensed assistive person who, while 23 
working as an unlicensed assistive person, was the subject of a complaint investigation by 24 
the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in a substantiated finding that 25 
was placed as a notation on the registry.  It requires the department to categorize criminal 26 
convictions as either disqual ifying or nondisqualifying convictions and to set 10 -year 27 
bans and 30 -year bans on employment for disqualifying convictions.  It sets a lifetime 28 
ban on employment for substantiated complaints involving abuse, neglect or 29 
misappropriation of property.  It pr ovides for petitions for the removal of employment 30 
bans.  It grandfathers in certain currently employed certified nursing assistants and 31 
unlicensed assistive persons, but provides that if they change their employers or 32 
employment at a specific facility or program, they become subject to the law.  It provides 33 
for the department to establish an advisory board to recommend changes to the list of 34 
named crimes in the registry.  It requires the department to obtain criminal history record 35 
information for certifie d nursing assistants every 2 years and employers to obtain criminal 36 
history record information prior to hiring an individual.  37
