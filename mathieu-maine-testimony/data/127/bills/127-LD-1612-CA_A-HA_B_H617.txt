Like the bill, this amendment implements recommendations of the Commission To 
Strengthen and Align the Services Provided to Maine's Veterans. This amendment also 
combines proposals from 5 Legislative Documents, L.D. 1343, L.D. 1590, L.D. 1611, 
L.D. 1612 and L.D. 1625, that improve the delivery of services and benefits to Maine 
veterans and provide tuition assistance to members of the Maine National Guard. 
Part A requires the Director of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' Services within the 
Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management to include marketing and 
outreach objectives as a core function of the bureau. The marketing and outreach 
objectives are intended to identify residents in the State who are veterans and also to 
maximize awareness of benefits and services available to veterans and family members of 
veterans. Part A also directs the bureau to acquire and implement an electronic records 
management system to create efficiencies and provide timely and effective customer 
service to veterans seeking assistance from the bureau. The bureau is required to serve as 
the primary source of information for veterans regarding the services, benefits and honors 
provided to veterans. Part A requires the director to employ 2 additional veteran service 
officers who are not assigned to a particular region but who will be directed to where the 
service needs of veterans are greatest and makes a current temporary position of outreach 
coordinator permanent. Part A establishes a special operations account from which the 
director may fund outreach and marketing efforts, acquire the records management 
system, fund mobile veteran service officers and cover the costs of efforts aimed at 
reducing veteran homelessness. 
Part B proposes changes to current law to address homelessness among veterans by 
requiring coordination of agencies that provide services to veterans to maximize 
resources available to support stable, permanent housing for veterans at risk of 
homelessness. Part B requires that the Director of the Bureau of Maine Veterans' 
Services within the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management be 
appointed to an existing entity, the Statewide Homeless Council. Part B requires the 
Statewide Homeless Council to develop a strategic plan to maximize existing services, 
enhance communication among providers and improve access to services that support 
permanent and stable housing for veterans. The director is required to report annually to 
the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over veterans affairs

Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management tasked with working on homelessness

established in Part E of this amendment. 
Part E establishes the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund to provide for a 
I 00% tuition waiver at any state postsecondary education institution for qualified 
members of the Maine National Guard. 
Part F directs the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College 
System to identify the needs of student-veterans on their campuses, including needs 
related to admission, degree completion, transitioning to civilian life and meeting 
personal and financial obligations, and directs the University of Maine System and the 
Maine Community College System to identify existing services that meet the needs 
identified, assess the effectiveness of those services, determine what services are not 
being offered that, if offered, would meet those needs and propose services and solutions

service, which will be $26,841,273 in fiscal year 2016-17; (2) $9,817,000 to the General Fund (GF); (3) up to 
$3,500,000 to each of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS), and; (4) remaining amounts to the Department of Transportation (DOT). This amendment raises the 
maximum transfer by an additional $1,228, 720 in fiscal year 2016-17 and has the following new order of 
distributions: (1) same payment of debt service; (2) $9,897,546 to the GF; (3) $600,000 to the Maine National Guard 
Postsecondary Fund; (4) $548,174 to the Bureau of Veterans Services Special Operations Fund; (5) up to $3,500,000 
to each of the DEP and the DHHS, and; (6) remaining amounts to the DOT.

through 2023-24: (1) payment of debt service; (2) up to $3,500,000 each to the DEP and the DHHS, and; (3) 
remainder to the DOT. The new distribution would raise the maximum transfer by an additional $1,148,174 and has 
the following new order of distributions: (1) same payment of debt service; (2) up to $3,500,000 each to the DEP and

Under current law, the Liquor Fund, after all debt service and any ancillary obligations secured by the fund have been 
retired, proceeds are distributed as follows: (1) up to a total of 15% of funds to the DEP and the DHHS; (2) 35% to 
the DOT, and; (3) the remainder to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. This amendment has a new distribution as 
follows: (1) up to a total of 15% to the DEP and the DHHS; (2) $600,000 to the Maine National Guard Postsecondary 
Fund (3) $548,174 to the Bureau of Veterans Services Special Operations Fund; (4) 35% of the remaining funds to the 
DOT, and; (5) 65% of the remainder to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The Liquor Fund is expected to receive sufficient revenue from liquor operations to make these transfers to the 
various entities. This amendment contains the necessary OSRF allocations to sufficiently operate the Veterans 
Services Special Operations Fund. 
This bill provides a sales tax exemption to all federally-chartered veterans' service organizations. This will reduce 
General Fund revenue and Local Government Fund revenue annually beginning in fiscal year 2016-17. The reduction 
to the General Fund will be $80,546 in fiscal year 2016-17, $91,822 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $95,954 in fiscal year 
2018-19. A one-time Liquor Fund revenue transfer will reimburse the General Fund in fiscal year 2016-17 only for the 
$80,546 loss. No Liquor Fund transfers will be made after fiscal year 2016-17 to reimburse the General Fund for the 
loss of sales tax revenue in subsequent years. 
The bill establishes the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund within the Department of Defense, Veterans and 
Emergency Management and provides annual Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the department of $600,000 
beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 to provide tuition assistance to eligible members. 
The requirement that the University of Maine System, the Maine Community College System and Maine Maritime 
Academy waive tuition costs that exceed the amount of tuition benefit a member receives from the Maine National 
Guard Postsecondary Fund may result in a loss of tuition revenue to the State's public postsecondary educational 
institutions.
