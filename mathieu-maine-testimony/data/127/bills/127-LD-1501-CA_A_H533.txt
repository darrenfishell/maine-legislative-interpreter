9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ·A" to H.P. 1024, L.D. 1501 
This amendment changes the bill by broadening the disqualification from 
unemployment benefits in current law for unemployment that is due to a stoppage of 
work caused by a labor dispute by eliminating the requirement that there is a stoppage of 
work. Instead, under the amendment, unemployment that is due to a labor dispute is 
sufficient grounds for a denial of benefits. The amendment also updates the language of 
the exceptions in current law to this disqualification to reflect the elimination of the 
stoppage of work requirement.
