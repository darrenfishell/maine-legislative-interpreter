'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the State's MaineCare providers that are subject to the service provider tax 
have experienced an increase in the tax since January 1, 2016; and 
Whereas, MaineCare providers have insufficient reserves to withstand cost 
increases; and 
Whereas, private nonmedical institutions and other facilities provide services to 
Maine's vulnerable citizens, including children, individuals with substance use disorders, 
and adults with intellectual disabilities and autistic disorder; and 
Whereas, private nonmedical institutions and other facilities that provide such 
services need increased funding to continue providing those services; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. Appropriations and allocations. The following appropriations and 
allocations are made.
