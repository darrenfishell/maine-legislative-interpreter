Fiscal Note 
No net fiscal impact -Unorganized Territory 
Allowing certain teachers in the unorganized territory who meet the definition of classroom-based employee pursuant 
to Title 5, ยง 17959, sub-ยง 1-A, who have reached normal retirement age and who retired after September 1,2011 to be 
restored to service as classroom-based employees at 100% of the compensation established for the position to be filled 
for up to a maximum of 5 years will have no net fiscal impact on the Education in the Unorganized TenitOlY program 
within the Depmiment of Education or the taxpayers in the unorganized tenitory. 
When limitations on conditions of restoration to service after retirement were enacted in 2011 no costs or savings 
were budgeted. It was assumed that limiting compensation to 75% would deter some retirees from retuming to work 
and those positions would have to be filled by replacement workers. The State would have to pay health insurance 
costs and retirement costs for new replacement workers, which would offset the savings from the 25% reduction in 
compensation for those who would return at the lower pay.
