 SUMMARY  1 
This bill enacts the Uniform Interstate Enforcement of Domestic Violence Protection 2 
Orders Act approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State 3 
Laws in 2002.  The purposes o f the bill and section -by-section descriptions are included 4 
in the Comments provided by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform 5 
State Laws.  The Uniform Act is intended to be consistent with the federal Violence 6 
Against Women Act as reauthorize d in 2013 in Public Law 113 -4.  The full faith and 7 
credit provisions are codified in 18 United States Code, Section 2265.  8 
The Uniform Act provides an optional registration process for domestic violence 9 
protection orders, known as "protection from abuse ord ers" in Maine, issued by a tribunal 10 
in another state.  A protection order from another state may be registered in Maine by 11 
presenting a certified copy of the order to the office of the clerk of any District Court or 12 
of any Superior Court of this State.  13 
The Maine Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, which currently applies 14 
to foreign protection orders, is amended to clarify that the new Uniform Interstate 15 
Enforcement of Domestic Violence Protection Orders Act may also be used to enforce 16 
foreign prot ection orders.  17
