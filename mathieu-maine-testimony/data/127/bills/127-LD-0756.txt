SUMMARY  29 
This bill amends the Address Confidentiality Program statute to make clear that the 30 
protected address of a certified program participant in the possession of a state or local 31 
government agency or court that has been authorized to use it for bona fide statutory, 32 
administrative or law enforcement purposes otherwise remains confidential and must be 33 
kept under seal and excluded from inspection by the public.  34 
The bi ll amends the laws governing the registry of deeds and assessment of property 35 
taxes to provide address confidentiality protection to participants in the program upon 36 
request.  In the registry of deeds, a program participant's Address Confidentiality Progra m 37 
identification number rather than name must be used in the record on the registry's 38 
publicly accessible website.  A municipal assessor must include the identification number 39 
rather than the program participant's name in the assessment.  40
