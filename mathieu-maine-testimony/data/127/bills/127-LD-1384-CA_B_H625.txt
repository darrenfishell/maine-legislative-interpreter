A. Any impairment detection must be confirmed through a medical review by an 
occupational health care provider prior to any further action by the employer based 
on the impairment determination. The occupational health care provider may require 
that the employee submit to testing for substances of abuse, including prescription 
medications, to assist in investigating and confirming the impairment detection. The 
occupational health care provider may perform a fitness-for-duty evaluation of the 
employee. The occupational health care provider may direct the employee to obtain 
further medical evaluation either by the employee's physician or by another licensed 
physician acceptable to the occupational health care provider. 
. B. Any substance use testing subsequent to an impairment detection confirmation 
must be done by an independent testing facility and all screening and confirmatory 
test results must be delivered to the medical review officer for review according to 
section 683, subsection 8, paragraph E. The medical review officer shall provide the 
results to the occupational health care provider and may not provide the results to the 
employer. When an employer is using a substance use test only, the medical review 
officer shall provide the results to the employer. Prescription medications may be 
tested for only when impairment detection has been made, and only for the purpose 
of assisting the occupational health care provider in evaluating whether an employee 
is impaired and the cause of the impairment. 
C. The occupational health care provider shall make the final determination of 
whether an employee was or is impaired, identify the cause of any impairment, 
determine whether the employee can continue to perform any safety-sensitive tasks 
and determine the impairment remediation program, if any, necessary to ensure that 
the impairment will not recur or will not adversely affect the safety of the employee, 
coworkers and other persons at the work site in the future. The occupational health 
care provider may also make further recommendations regarding the employee's 
ability to safely perform all assigned tasks, including requiring any remedial 
measures, including, but not limited to, compliance with return-to-work agreements 
or a written agreement by the employee to schedule any necessary medications in a 
manner that will not lead to impairment on the job. A return-to-work agreement may 
be used if an employee has violated the drug-free workplace policy and has been 
provided the opportunity to participate in treatment as a condition of continued 
employment or reemployment. 
D. If the occupational health care provider finds that the employee was not impaired 
on the job or that any such impairment did not pose a safety risk and did not violate 
the employer's established drug-free workplace policy, the employer shall reinstate 
the employee to the employee's position. 
E. If an impairment detection is made at a time when an occupational health care 
provider is not normally available for work, the employer may take any steps to 
remove the employee, and, prior to the employee's next scheduled work day, the 
employer may determine whether to allow the employee to return to work or to 
request an impairment determination or fitness-for-duty evaluation by the 
occupational health care provider. 
F. An occupational health care provider who makes or acts upon an impairment 
determination in accordance with this section is not subject to a cause of action as 
Page 15 -127LR0458(03)-l 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT~" to H.P. 937, L.D. 1384 
1 long as the determination is based on the occupational health care provider's good 
2 faith, professional judgment. An occupational health care provider may not be an 
3 employee or agent of, or have any :financial interest in, a testing laboratory for which 
4 the occupational health care provider is reviewing drug test results. An occupational 
5 health care provider may not derive any financial benefit by having an employer use 
6 a laboratory that may be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

11 A. The employer and the employee have bargained for provisions in a collective 
12 bargaining agreement, either before or after the effective date of this subchapter, that 
13 provide for random or arbitrary testing of employees. A random or arbitrary testing 
14 program that would result from implementation of an employer's last best offer is not 
15 considered a provision bargained for in a collective bargaining agreement for 
16 purposes of this section; 
17 B. The employee works in a position the nature of which weals ereate an

4 Sec. 11. 26 MRSA §685, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §3, is further amended 
5 to read: 
6 §685. Action taken on substance use tests

1 O pay and benefits or may transfer the employee to another position with no reduction in 
11 pay or benefits while awaiting an employee's test results. 
12 2. Use of confirmation test results. This subsection governs an employer's use of 
13 confirmed positive results and an employee's or applicant's refusal to submit to a test 
14 requested or required by an employer in compliance with this subchapter. 
15 A. Subject to any limitation of the Maine Human Rights Act or any other state law or 
16 federal law, and to provisions in this subsection, an employer may use a confirmed 
17 positive test result 0f for a substance of abuse, refusal to submit to a substance use 
18 test, a violation of an established drug-free workplace policy or an impairment 
19 confirmed by an occupational health care provider pursuant to section 684,

21 (1) Refusal to hire an applicant for employment or refusal to place an applicant 
22 on a roster of eligibility; 
23 (2) Discharge of an employee; 
24 (3) Discipline of an employee; or 
25 ( 4) Change in the employee's work assignment. 
26 A-1. An employer who tests a person as an applicant and employs that person prior

28 accordance with the employee provisions of the 0fflf)loyer's af)f)fevea uniform 
29 impairment and substance use testing policy. 
30 B. Before taking any action described in paragraph A in the case of an employee

33 rehaeilitatiea treatment program designed to enable the employee to avoid future use 
34 of a substance of abuse and to participate in an employee assistance program, if the 
35 employer has such a program. A confirmed impairment under section 684, 
36 subsection 2-B caused by a substance of abuse is the same as an initial confirmed 
3 7 positive result for purposes of this paragraph, with or without a substance use test 
38 result. A treatment program under this paragraph may be provided by an occupational 
39 health care provider. Participation by an employee in a treatment program must 
40 begin within 30 days of the employee's receiving notice of the positive test result or 
41 confirmed impairment, unless otherwise agreed to by the employer. The employer

confirmed positive result from a substance use test administered by the employer 
under this subchapter or the employee receives a subsequent confirmed impairment 
caused by a substance of abuse with or without a substance use test. 
C. If the employee chooses not to participate in a rehahilitati:ea treatment program 
under this subsection, the employer may take any action described in paragraph A. If 
the employee chooses to participate in a rehahilitati:eB: treatment program, the 
following provisions apply. 
(1) If the employer has an employee assistance program that offers counseling or 
rehaeilitatiea treatment services, the employee may choose to enter that program

employee assistance program or if the employee chooses not to participate in that 
program, the employee may enter a public or private rehaeilitatioa treatment 
program. 
(a) Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 
plan, the costs of the public or private rehaeilitatioB: treatment program.,,jf 
required by the employer, must be equally divided between the employer and 
employee if the employer has more than~ 50 full-time employees. This 
requirement does not apply to municipalities or other political subdivisions of 
the State or to any employer when the employee is tested because of the 
alcohol and controlled substance testing mandated by the federal Omnibus 
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102-143, Title V. 
If aeeessary, the The employer shall may assist in financing the cost share of 
the employee through a payroll deduction plan. 
(b) Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 
plan, an employer with~ 50 or fewer full-time employees, a municipality or 
other political subdivision of the State is not required to pay for any costs of 
rehaeilitatiea er treatment under any public or private rehahilitatioa treatment 
program. An employer is not required to pay for the costs of rehahilitatieR 
treatment if the employee was tested because of the alcohol and controlled 
substance testing mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation Employee 
Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102-143, Title V. 
(2) Ne An employer may not take any action described in paragraph A while an 
employee is participating in a rehaeilitatiea treatment program, except as 
provided in subparagraph (2-A) and except that an employer may change the 
employee's work assignment or suspend the employee from active duty to reduce 
any possible safety hazard. Except as provided in subparagraph (2-A), an 
employee's pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee is participating 
in a rehahilitatiea treatment program, 13roYia00 except that the employer is not 
required to pay the employee for periods in which the employee is unavailable 
for work for the purposes of rehahili-tatioa treatment or while the employee is 
medically disqualified. The employee may apply normal sick leave and vacation 
time, if any, for these periods.

(2-A) A rehaeilitatiea er treatment provider shall promptly notify the employer 
if the employee fails to comply with the prescribed rehaeilitatiea treatment 
program before the expiration of the a meath 12-week period provided in 
paragraph B. Upon receipt of this notice, the employer may take any action 
described in paragraph A. 
(3) Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 
rehaeilitatiea treatment program, as determined by the rehaeilitatiea er treatment 
provider after consultation with the employer, the employee is entitled to return 
to the employee's previous job with full pay and benefits unless conditions 
unrelated to the employee's previous confirmed positive result make the 
employee's return impossible. Reinstatement of the employee mast may not 
conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement between the 
employer and a labor organization that is the collective bargaining representative 
of the unit of which the employee is or would be a part. If the rehaei:litatiea er 
treatment provider determines that the employee has not successfully completed 
the rehaeilitatiea treatment program within 6 months after starting the program, 
the employer may take any action described in paragraph A. 
(a) If the employee who has completed rehaeilitatiea treatment previously 
worked in an employment position subject to random or arbitrary testing 
under an employer's written policy, the employer may refuse to allow the 
employee to return to the previous job if the employer believes that the 
employee may pose an unreasonable safety hazard because of the nature of 
the position. The employer shall attempt to find suitable work for the 
employee immediately after refusing the employee's return to the previous 
position. No reduction may be made in the employee's previous benefits or 
rate of pay while awaiting reassignment to work or while working in a 
position other than the previous job. The employee shall must be reinstated 
to the previous position or to another position with an equivalent rate of pay 
and benefits and with no loss of seniority within 6 months after returning to 
work in any capacity with the employer unless the employee has received a 
subsequent confirmed positive result within that time from a test 
administered under this subchapter or unless conditions unrelated to the 
employee's previous confirmed positive test result make that reinstatement or 
reassignment impossible. Placement of the employee in suitable work and 
reinstatement may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining 
agreement between the employer and a labor organization that is the 
collective bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or 
would be a part. 
' 
(b) Notwithstanding division (a), if an employee who has successfully 
completed rehaeilitatiea treatment is medically disqualified, the employer is 
not required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 
during the period of disqualification. The employer is not required to 
compensate the employee during the period of disqualification. Immediately 
after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 
obligations under division (a) attach as if the employee had successfully 
completed rehaeilitatiea treatment on that date.

1 D. This subsection does not require an employer to take any disciplinary action 
2 against an employee who refuses to submit to a test, receives a single or repeated 
3 confirmed positive result or does not choose to participate in a rehabilitation 
4 treatment program. This subsection is intended to set minimum opportunities for an 
5 employee with a substance abuse problem to address the problem through 
6 rehabilitation treatment. An employer may offer additional opportunities, not 
7 otherwise in violation of this subchapter, for rehabilitation treatment or continued 
8 employment without rehabilitation treatment. 
9 3. Confidentiality. This subsection governs the use of information acquired by an 
10 employer in the testing process. 
11 A. Unless the employee or applicant consents, all information acquired by an 
12 employer in the testing process is confidential and may not be released to any person 
13 other than the employee or applicant who is tested, any necessary personnel of the 
14 employer and a provider of rehabilitation or treatment services under subsection 2, 
15 paragraph C. This paragraph does not prevent: 
16 (1) The release of this information when required or permitted by state or federal 
17 law, including release under section 683, subsection 8, paragraph D; or 
18 (2) The use of this information in any grievance procedure, administrative 
19 hearing or civil action relating to the imposition of the test or the use of test 
20 results.

25 testing" and the Revisor of Statutes shall implement this revision when updating,

27 SUMMARY 
28 This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
29 makes changes to the laws governing employment practices concerning substance abuse 
30 testing, including the following. 
31 1. It replaces the phrase "substance abuse test" and "substance abuse testing" with 
32 "substance use test" and "substance use testing" to reflect more modern terminology. 
33 2. It repeals a section of law that addresses nuclear power plants since there are no 
34 operating nuclear power plants in this State. 
35 3. It authorizes an employer that has employees subject to a federally mandated 
36 substance use testing program to extend federal drug testing activities to its entire 
37 workforce in order to maintain a single testing program and specifies that the employer 
38 must prepare a substance use testing plan for employees who are not federally regulated, 
39 provide a copy of the plan to the employees and the Department of Labor before testing, 
Page 23 -127LR0458(03)-l 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT :B" to H.P. 937, L.D. 1384 
1 follow federal notification and procedural protocols for such employees and annually 
2 report the results of testing to the department. 
3 4. It streamlines the current drug testing policy approval by requiring the Department 
4 of Labor to develop a uniform impairment and substance use testing policy applicable to 
5 all employers. Employers must notify, and be approved by, the Department of Labor 
6 prior to conducting substance use testing. 
7 5. It removes the "probable cause" standard and replaces it with an "impairment 
8 detection" standard required before the employer may conduct substance use testing. For 
9 employers authorized to conduct substance use testing, only an employer or employee 
10 approved for impairment detection by the Department of Labor or a medical person may 
11 make an impairment detection. Among other things, this detection may be based on a 
12 single work-related accident, unlike the "probable cause" standard under current law. The 
13 employer may immediately remove the employee from the workplace pending resolution 
14 of the impairment detection. 
15 6. It adds an "impairment determination" process that may be used as an alternative 
16 or in addition to a substance use test. Under this process, an occupational health care 
17 provider conducts a medical review in order to confirm the impairment detection, which 
18 may include a substance use test that includes testing for prescription drugs. If the 
19 impairment is confirmed, the employer may take employment action including firing or 
20 disciplining the employee, subject to any limitations under the Maine Human Rights Act 
21 and any other state or federal law. If the occupational health care provider finds that the 
22 employee was not impaired or that such impairment did not pose a safety risk, the 
23 employee is entitled to full reinstatement of the employee's position. 
24 7. It adds a violation of an established drug-free workplace policy as grounds for 
25 employment action; 
26 8. It adds a first impairment determination to the requirement, applicable to an initial 
27 confirmed positive substance use test, that the employer must provide the employee with 
28 an opportunity to participate in a treatment program before discharging or disciplining the 
29 employee. The time frame for completing the treatment program is reduced from 6 
30 months to 12 weeks, and an employer with between 20 and 50 full-time employees is no 
31 longer required to pay half of the costs of the treatment program. An employer with more 
32 than 50 full-time employees must pay half of treatment costs not covered by a group 
33 health insurance plan when the treatment program is required of the employee. 
34 9. It modifies the current requirement that, prior to establishing a substance use 
35 testing program, an employer with over 20 full-time employees have a functioning 
36 employee assistance program, instead requiring the program of employers with over 50 
37 full-time employees. 
38 10. It expands the number of establishments that may undertake company-wide 
39 random substance abuse testing by authorizing such testing companies with 10 or more 
40 employees instead of with 50 employees, as is the current standard. 
41 11. It provides that all confirmed positive substance use tests may be reported to the 
42 employee only by a medical review officer and allows an employee to provide a 
43 legitimate medical explanation for a positive test result for legally obtained medications,

1 preventing the medical review officer from reporting a positive test for that substance to 
2 the employer. 
3 12. It allows testing laboratories to use federal testing standards to encourage testing 
4 of biological samples beyond urine and blood. 
5 13. It adds a new civil violation for any employer noncompliance with the substance 
6 use testing laws, for which a fine of not more than $500 for the first violation, $750 for 
7 the 2nd violation and $1,000 for 3rd and subsequent violations may be adjudged.
