127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT .. 4,, to H.P. 1114, L.D. 1637, Bill, "An Act To 
Assist Maine Citizens Residing along Public Easements" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
• An Act To Require a Municipality To Maintain a Public Easement on Which a Mail 
Route Exists' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 23 MRSA §3202 is repealed and the following enacted in its place: 
§3202. Mail routes; snow fences 
If a municipality holds a public easement over which there is a mail route. it is the 
responsibility of that municipality to keep the mail route to the standard required by 
United States Postal Service regulations. The municipal officers of a town, or any road 
commissioner under their direction. may take down a fence upon the line of a public 
highway when the municipal officers consider it necessary to prevent the drifting of snow 
onto the public highway, but the fence must be replaced. in due season and in as good 
condition as when taken down. without expense to the owner.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. This amendment removes 
the section of the bill relating to maintenance of public easements if retained or not 
retained at the time of discontinuance. It replaces "right-of-way" with "public easement" 
in the mail route section and retains current statutory language regarding the removal of 
snow fences by a municipality.
