 A.  To determine the top threshold amount for the bracket structure under subsection 1 
3-E for the first calculation year, the State Tax Assessor shall determine the taxable 2 
income threshold that separates the top 2% of individuals filing married joint returns 3 
or surviving spouses permitted to file joint returns in the previous calendar year.  T he 4 
top threshold amount under subsection 1 -E is 50% of the amount determined for 5 
subsection 3 -E.  The top threshold amount for subsection 2 -E is 75% of the amount 6 
determined for subsection 3 -E. 7 
B.  The top incremental amount is the amount of tax that would  be paid on the top 8 
threshold amount.  9 
C.  The top threshold amount for the first calculation year must be indexed for the 10 
2nd and 3rd calculation years in the same manner as other bracket amounts under 11 
section 5403.  12 
SUMMARY  13 
This bill adds a new marginal in come tax rate of 10% on income tax filers with 14 
taxable income in the top 2% of all taxpayers beginning with 2016 tax years.  The State 15 
Tax Assessor is directed to determine the top taxable income threshold amount 16 
establishing the top 2% of taxpayers every 3 years.  Bracket amounts are indexed for 17 
inflation in the years in which a new calculation is not made.  18
