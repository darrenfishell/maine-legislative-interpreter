SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Judiciary, replaces the bill, which is a concept draft. It provides that a complaint for 
review of a municipal decision on a significant land use project may be filed with either 
the general docket of the Superior Court, as in current law, or directly with the Business 
and Consumer Docket in the Superior Court established by the Maine Supreme Judicial 
Court by Administrative Order JB-07-1 (A.11-08). It also provides that, if a complaint is 
filed with the general docket, any party to the appeal may request that the complaint be 
transferred to the Business and Consumer Docket and the Business and Consumer Docket 
is required to accept the transfer. 
The amendment requires that a defendant municipality must file the record for review 
as agreed upon by the parties within 35 days of the commencement of the action, as 
opposed to 40 days pursuant to current court rules, unless the court extends the time for 
cause. The plaintiff is required to reimburse the municipality for the cost of producing the 
record. 
A party may appeal the Superior Court decision of a significant municipal land use 
decision, whether from the general docket or the Business and Consumer Docket, to the 
Supreme Judicial Court. Upon the request of any party, and in the interests of justice, the 
Supreme Judicial Court may expedite the briefing schedule.
