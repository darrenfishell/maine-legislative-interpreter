 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  4 MRSA §807, sub -§3, ¶S, as reallocated by RR 2013, c. 1, §7, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
S.  A person  An individual  who is the sole member of a limited liability company or 4 
is a member of a li mited liability company that is owned by a married couple or, 5 
registered domestic partners or an individual and that individual's issue as defined in 6 
Title 18 -A, section 1 -201, subsection (21)  who is not an attorney but is appearing for 7 
that company in an action for forcible entry and detainer pursuant to Title 14, chapter 8 
709. 9

SUMMARY  11 
Current law provides that a person who is the sole member of a limited liability 12 
company or is a member of a limited liability c ompany that is owned by a married couple 13 
or registered domestic partners who is not an attorney may appear in court for that 14 
company in an action for forcible entry and detainer.  This bill limits the application of 15 
this provision of law to an individual.  The bill also allows an individual who is not an 16 
attorney and who is a member of a limited liability company that is owned by an 17 
individual and that individual's issue to appear in court for that company in an action for 18 
forcible entry and detainer.  The bill also strikes the statutory repeal of the provision.  19
