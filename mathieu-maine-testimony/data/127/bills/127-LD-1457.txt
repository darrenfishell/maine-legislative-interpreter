 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, ownership of certain parcels of property in the Unorganized Territory of 3 
the State has dev olved to the State due to property tax delinquencies; and  4 
Whereas, the sale and conveyance of such parcels by the State Tax Assessor require 5 
the authorization of the Legislature; and  6 
Whereas, legislative action is immediately necessary to ensure timely and  efficient 7 
property tax administration in the Unorganized Territory; and  8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 10 
immediately neces sary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 11 
therefore, be it  12 
Sec. 1.  State Tax Assessor authorized to convey real estate.  Resolved:  13 
That the State Tax Assessor is authorized to convey by sale the interest of the State in real 14

following provisions.  17 
1. Notice of the sale must be published 3 times prior to the s ale, once each week for 3 18 
consecutive weeks, in a newspaper in the county where the real estate lies, except in those 19 
cases in which the sale is to be made to a specific individual or individuals as authorized 20 
in this resolve, in which case notice need not  be published.  21 
2. A parcel may not be sold for less than the amount authorized in this resolve. If 22 
identical high bids are received, the bid postmarked with the earliest date is considered 23
