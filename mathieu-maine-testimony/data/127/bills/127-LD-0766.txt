further amended to read:  3 
B.  A primary caregiver who has been designated by a patient to cultivate marijuana 4 
for the p atient's medical use must keep all plants in an enclosed, locked facility unless 5 
the plants are being transported because the primary caregiver is moving or taking the 6 
plants to the primary caregiver's own property in order to cultivate them.  The 7 
primary caregiver shall use a numerical identification system to enable the primary 8 
caregiver to identify marijuana plants cultivated for a patient.  Access to the 9 
cultivation facility is limited to the primary caregiver, except that an elected official 10 
invited by  the primary caregiver for the purpose of providing education to the elected 11 
official on cultivation by the primary caregiver, emergency services personnel or a 12 
person who needs to gain access to the cultivation facility in order to perform repairs 13 
or main tenance or to do construction may access the cultivation facility to provide 14 
those professional services while under the direct supervision of the primary 15 
caregiver.  16 
(1)  After January 1, 2016,  a primary caregiver may not cultivate marijuana in a 17 
resident ial building unless that caregiver has obtained from an electrical inspector 18 
approved by the department certification that any electrical system used in the 19 
cultivation is in compliance with applicable electrical codes and is adequate and 20 
safe for the amou nt of cultivation that is occurring in the residential building, 21 
considering the number of qualifying patients who have designated the primary 22 
caregiver to cultivate marijuana on their behalf.  The department by rule shall 23 
establish standards for certifica tion and for approval of an electrical inspector, 24 
who must be either the municipal electrical inspector who issues permits pursuant 25 
to Title 30 -A, section 4173 for the municipality in which the residential building 26 
is located or a qualified electrician.  T he department shall approve the municipal 27 
electrical inspector of a municipality that agrees to participate in the required 28 
inspection and certification. Rules adopted under this subparagraph are routine 29 
technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 30

designated by a pati ent to cultivate marijuana for the patient's medical use and who will 34 
cultivate the marijuana in a residential building must submit to the department the 35
