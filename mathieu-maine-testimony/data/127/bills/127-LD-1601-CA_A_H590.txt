COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1092, L.D. 1601 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment clarifies the terminology in the language of the bill defining the civil 
3 violation of misrepresentation to align it with the new definition of "assistance animal" 
4 and the updated definition of "service animal" in the Maine Human Rights Act. The 
5 amendment makes clear that representing as a service animal an animal that does not 
6 meet the definition of "service animal," whether it is a dog or any other species of animal, 
7 is a civil violation. 
8 This amendment provides that the maximum fine of $1,000 proposed in the bill 
9 applies to each occurrence of misrepresentation. A person who knowingly provides 
10 documents falsely stating that an animal is a service animal or assistance animal can be 
11 fined for each time the person provides the documents. 
12 These changes are consistent with the recommendations of the task force to ensure 
13 integrity in the use of service animals established pursuant to Resolve 2015, chapter 36.
