 SUMMARY  1 
This bill, which contains the recommendations of the working group convened 2 
pursuant to Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part QQQQ to evaluate  the lack of access to 3 
affordable housing, is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, 4 
Commerce, Research and Economic Development pursuant to that law.  The bill directs 5 
the Maine State Housing Authority and municipal housing authorities to create a single, 6 
statewide application and waiting list for so -called Section 8 housing and to ensure that 7 
the application can be filled out online.  The bill directs the Maine State Housing 8 
Authority and the Department of Health and Human Services to ensu re that the 9 
application can be used by individuals and families to apply for the federal Shelter Plus 10 
Care program and the state Bridging Rental Assistance Program.  The bill further directs 11 
the Maine State Housing Authority to examine options to increase access to affordable 12 
housing for families with incomes at or below 30% of the area median income and to 13 
establish a rental assistance pilot program.  14 
The Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic 15 
Development has not taken a position  on the substance of this bill and by reporting this 16 
bill out the committee is not suggesting and does not intend to suggest that it agrees or 17 
disagrees with any aspect of this bill.  The committee is reporting the bill out for the sole 18 
purpose of turning the working group's recommendations into a printed bill that can be 19 
referred to the committee for an appropriate public hearing and subsequent processing in 20 
the normal course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency 21 
in the l egislative review of the working group's recommendations.  22
