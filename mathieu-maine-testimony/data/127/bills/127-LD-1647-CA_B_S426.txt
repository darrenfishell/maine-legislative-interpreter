SUMMARY 
This amendment is one of 2 minority reports of the committee. The bill increases the 
driver's license suspension period from 150 days to 180 days for a person who is 
convicted of operating under the influence and who has no previous operating under the 
influence convictions within the prior 10 years. The bill imposes a license suspension 
period or period of ineligibility for a license of 6 months for a person who is convicted of 
a drug crime under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, chapter 45, except for such a 
crime under section 1116. This amendment makes the change from 150 to 180 days in 2 
other provisions of operating under the influence law. The amendment adds to several 
provisions of the bill an exception based on compelling circumstances found by the court. 
In the case of a drug conviction under Title 17-A, chapter 45, this exception could negate 
the suspension completely. In the case of an operating under the influence conviction, 
this exception could decrease the suspension period to 150 days. 
This amendment adds an allocation for the cost of computer programming 
necessitated by the changes made to the bill.
