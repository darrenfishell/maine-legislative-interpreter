submitted by the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety in 10 
order to begin conside ration by the committee of the recommendations of the working 11 
group.  The bill does the following:  12 
1.  It establishes a permissible inference of operating under the influence of 13 
intoxicants when a person operates a motor vehicle and has a level of delta -9- 14 
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, of 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of blood;  15

nanograms or more pe r milliliter of blood and an alcohol level of 0.05 grams or more of 18 
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or 210 liters of breath;  19 
3.  It establishes a 0.00 nanogram level for THC for a person under 21 years of age 20 
and provides an affirmative defense for ma rijuana use in compliance with the Maine 21 
Medical Use of Marijuana Act; and  22 
4. It permits a qualified law enforcement officer, without making an arrest, to request 23 
that a person who the officer reasonably believes has been operating under the influence 24 
take a preliminary breath test for alcohol level and allows the results to be used to 25 
determine whether there is probable cause to believe the person was operating under the 26 
influence.  27
