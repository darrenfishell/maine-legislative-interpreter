Sec. 3. 35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§3-B is enacted to read: 
3-B. Portfolio requirements; waste-to-energy resources. Portfolio requirements 
for waste-to-energy resources are governed by this subsection. 
As a condition oflicensing pursuant to section 3203, each competitive electricity provider 
in this State must demonstrate in a manner satisfactory to the commission that no less 
than the following percentage of its portfolio of supply sources for retail electricity sales 
in this State is accounted for by waste-to-energy resources: 
A. One percent for the period from January l, 2017 to February 14, 2018: and 
B. Two and a half percent beginning February 15, 2018.

attribute trading exists. When renewable energy credits are used to satisfy the portfolio 
requirements of subsections 3 aaa~ 3-A and 3-B, the value of a renewable energy credit 
for electricity generated by a community-based renewable energy project, as defined in 
section 3602, that is participating in the community-based renewable energy pilot 
program established in section 3603 and elects the renewable energy credit multiplier

B. The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments made by 
competitive electricity providers and shall deposit all funds collected under this

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee and it replaces the bill and 
changes the title. This amendment differs from the bill in the following ways. 
1. It changes the term "waste energy resources" to "waste-to-energy resources" to be 
consistent with other statutory provisions. 
2. It removes the section that would have added waste energy resources to the 
definition of "renewable capacity resource" in order to clarify that waste-to-energy 
resources would create a separate class of renewable energy credits. 
3. It amends the definition of "renewable energy credit" to include electricity 
generated from waste-to-energy resources. 
4. It includes in the definition of "waste-to-energy resource" a provision that 
disqualifies any generator that is a party to a power purchase agreement under the federal 
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. 
5. It lowers the proposed portfolio requirement for waste-to-energy resources from 
3.5% to 1% from January 1, 2017 to February 14, 2018 and to 2.5% beginning February 
15, 2018 to more accurately reflect the level of generation from the eligible waste-to­
energy facilities in Maine and to lessen the impact on ratepayers. 
6. It adds language to clarify that renewable energy credits from waste-to-energy 
resources used to satisfy the new portfolio requirement may not be used to satisfy eligible 
resources and new renewable capacity resources portfolio requirements. 
7. It sets the initial alternative compliance payment base rate at $10 per megawatt­
hour, to be adjusted for inflation on an annual basis and published annually by the Public 
Utilities Commission.

Potential current biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Potential transfer to Efficiency Maine Trust 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill allows competitive electricity providers to pay an alternative compliance payment of $10 per megawatt-hoL 
to the Public Utilities Commission as a way to satisfy portfolio requirements for waste-to-energy resources. Any 
revenue would be transferred to the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund within the Efficiency Maine 
Trust. The PUC has indicated that it is not expecting any competitive electricity providers to make these payments at 
this time. Beginning January 1, 2018, the PUC is required to adjust the alternative compliance payment rate by the 
annual change in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Any additional costs to the PUC to 
require waste-to-energy resources to meet certain portfolio requirements are expected to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources.
