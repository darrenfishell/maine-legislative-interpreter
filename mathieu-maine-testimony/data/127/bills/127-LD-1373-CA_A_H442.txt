SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development, eliminates the $100,000 
funding in the bill for the Industry Partnership Assistance Collaborative and instead adds 
it to the appropriation for the Maine Community College System's Maine Quality Centers 
for a total of $1,000,000 in each year of the fiscal biennium. The Maine Quality Centers 
appropriation is consolidated to include use both for tuition assistance for individuals 
participating in workforce training and to match funding and contributions from 
participating businesses. 
. The amendment directs the Board of Trustees of the Maine Community College 
System to adopt necessary policies and procedures for the Maine Quality Centers, 
including consideration of at least 5 specific factors. It also requires program participants 
to use existing financial aid resources available through their sponsoring postsecondary 
education institution before using program resources, which may be used only for unrnet 
expenses for tuition, fees or books. 
Additionally, the amendment requires participating employers under the Put ME to 
Work Program to hire successful trainees at a rate at least $2.50 per hour more than the 
minimum hourly wage rate as set in Maine statute and to pay incumbent worker trainees 
an hourly wage that meets or exceeds the median wage for that occupation as identified 
by the Center for Workforce Research and Information within the Department of Labor. 
The amendment eliminates the provision of the bill that allows employers to make 
voluntary donations to the Competitive Skills Scholarship Fund.
