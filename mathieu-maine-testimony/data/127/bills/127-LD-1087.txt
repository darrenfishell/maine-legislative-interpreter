 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1

amended to read:  3 
4.  Refusals; denials.   If a body or an agency or official having custody or control of 4 
any public record refuses permission to inspect or copy or abstract a public record, the 5

the denial or the expectation that the request will be denied in full or in part fol lowing a 7 
review , within 5 working days of the receipt of the request for inspection or copying.  8 
Failure to comply with this subsection is considered failure to allow inspection or 9

Sec. 2.  1 MRS A §409, sub -§1, as repealed and replaced by PL 2013, c. 350, §3, 11

1.  Records.  Any person aggrieved by a refusal or denial to inspect or copy a record 13 
or the failure to allow the inspection or copying of a record under section 408 -A may  14 
appeal the refusal, denial or failure within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the written 15 
notice of refusal, denial or failure to any the Superior Court within the State for the 16 
county where the person resides or the agency has its principal office  as a trial de novo.  17 
The agency or official shall file an answer  a statement of position explaining the basis for 18 
denial  within 14 calendar days of service of the appeal .  If a court, after a trial de novo 19 
review, with taking of testimony and other evidence as  determined necessary , determines 20 
such refusal, denial or failure was not for just and proper cause, the court shall enter an 21 
order for disclosure.  Appeals may be advanced on the docket and receive priority over 22 
other cases when the court determines that the interests of justice so require.  23 
Sec. 3.  1 MRSA §413, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 662, §8, is amended to 24 
read:  25 
1.  Designation; responsibility.   Each agency, county, municipality, school 26 
administrative unit and regional or other political subdiv ision shall designate an existing 27 
employee as its public access officer to serve as the contact person for that agency, 28 
county, municipality, school administrative unit and regional or other political 29 
subdivision with regard to requests for public records under this subchapter.  The public 30 
access officer is responsible for ensuring that each public record request is acknowledged 31 
within a reasonable period of time  5 working days of receiving the request  and that a 32 
good faith estimate of when the response to the request will be complete is provided 33 
according to section 408 -A.  The public access officer shall serve as a resource within the 34 
agency, county, municipality, school administrative unit and regional or other political 35 
subdivision concerning freedom of access questions and compliance.  36 
SUMMARY  37 
This bill amends the Freedom of Access Act to make clear that an agency's or 38 
official's written notice of denial in response to a request to copy or inspect records may 39 
be a statement that the agency or official exp ects to deny the request in full or in part, but 40

 that decision can be made only after reviewing the records subject to the request.  The 1 
agency or official is required to provide the written response within 5 days of the receipt 2 
of the request.  3 
The bill cl arifies the procedures for an appeal from a denial of a request to inspect or 4 
copy public records.  Current law allows the appeal to be filed in any Superior Court; this 5 
bill requires the appeal to be filed in the Superior Court for the county in which eit her the 6 
requestor lives or in which the agency has its principal office.  Instead of filing an answer 7 
to the complaint, the agency or official may file a more informal statement of position 8 
explaining the basis for denial within 14 days of the service of t he appeal.  This bill 9 
eliminates the need for a de novo trial and instead requires the Superior Court to conduct 10 
a review de novo, taking whatever testimony or other evidence the court determines 11 
necessary.  The basis for the decision, whether the agency's  or official's refusal, denial or 12 
failure was not for just and proper cause, is not changed from current law.  13 
The bill also amends the laws governing public access officers by specifically 14 
requiring that a request for public records be acknowledged within 5 working days of the 15 
receipt of the request.  This is consistent with the current acknowledgement deadline in 16 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, section 408 -A, subsection 3.  17
