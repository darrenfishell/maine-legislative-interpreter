Fiscal Detail and·Notes 
The bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to contract for certain ombudsman services 
for the Medicaid program. The bill stipulates this will only occur if non-state funding is available. Currently, it is not 
anticipated that non-state funds would be made available now or in the near future. In addition, DHHS, in 
consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, has indicated that the non-state funds that were utilized in the 
past to obtain the federal medicaid grant funds for this contract are not suitable for consideration as matching funds. 
If the intent is to obtain federal dollars for this program the State will need to provide matching seed money.
