5 This amendment, which replaces the bill with a resolve, strikes from the bill

9 Transportation implement recommendations contained in the report titled "Maine State

11 April 4, 2008. Instead, the amendment requires the Department of Transportation to

18 amendment strikes the requirement that the Department of Transportation adopt rules 
19 relating to the Maine State Ferry Service regarding staffing levels and duties, 
20 transportation of hazardous materials and standard operating procedures relating to crew 
21 stations and duties. The amendment retains the requirement that the Department of 
22 Transportation adopt rules relating to the Maine State Ferry Service regarding 
23 transportation of medical samples and customer service and adds training to the rule-
24 making requirement. The amendment requires the Department of Transportation to 
25 report on the progress of its rulemaking to the joint standing committee of the Legislature
