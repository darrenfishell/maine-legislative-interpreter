Fiscal Note 
Transfer of state-owned property 
The bill authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Parks and Lands within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
and Forestry (ACF) to gift the state property known as John Paul Jones Memorial Park to the Town of Kittery. This 
property must continue to be used and managed for noncommercial governmental purposes as a public park. In the 
event the property is used otherwise, title to the property automatically reverts to ACF. The State Parks Commission 
valued this piece ofland at $30,750 in 1954. This property has never generated any revenue to the State. ACF 
indicated that there will be minor savings when Kittery takes over the park and pays the park's electricity bills.
