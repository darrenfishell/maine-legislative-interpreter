8 SENATE AMENDMENT" B" to S.P. 701, L.D. 1695, Bill, "An Act To Raise the 
9 Minimum Wage Incrementally to $10 Per Hour in 2020" 
10 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
11 'An Act To Raise the Minimum Wage Incrementally to $10 Per Hour in 2019' 
12 Amend the bill by inserting after the title the following: 
13 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
14 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
15 Whereas, Maine's minimum wage has not increased since 2009; and 
16 Whereas, Maine workers who earn at or near the minimum wage are among the 
17 most economically vulnerable of our citizens; and 
18 Whereas, Maine is one of 2 states facing a so-called demographic winter 
19 characterized by fewer births than deaths and fewer new workers entering the workforce 
20 than older workers retiring from it; and 
21 Whereas, Maine's so-called demographic winter has created a net workforce 
22 shortage; and 
23 Whereas, an increase in the minimum wage addresses this workforce shortage by 
24 attracting more workers; and 
25 Whereas, to effect a minimum wage increase that Maine's small businesses can 
26 afford requires reasonable lead time for those employers to plan for the implementation 
27 of such an increase; and 
28 Whereas, 2 months from the immediate enactment of this legislation is the shortest 
29 time period needed for employers to plan for the need to implement a higher wage 
30 without causing business disruptions and imposing costs adverse to employee welfare; 
31 and 
32 Whereas, this legislation raises the minimum wage on July 1, 2016 and emergency 
33 enactment is necessary to allow employers to plan for implementation without business 
34 disruptions and imposing costs adverse to employee welfare; and
