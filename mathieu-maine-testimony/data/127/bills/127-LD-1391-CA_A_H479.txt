manifested by recent behavior demonstrating an inability to avoid risk or to protect the 
patient adequately from impairment or injury if not medicated. 
The amendment revises the factors that the commissioner must consider in order to 
continue the ex;tension of the order allowing treatmynt without the patient's consent. The 
commissioner must find by clear and convincing evidence that: 
1. The patient has a mental illness or disorder; 
2. As a result of that illness or disorder the patient poses a substantial risk of hann to 
self or others or there is a reasonable certainty that the patient will suffer severe physical 
or mental harm as manifested by recent behavior demonstrating an inability to avoid risk 
or to protect the patient adequately from impairment or injury ifnot medicated; 
3. There is no less intrusive alternative to involuntary medication; and 
4. The need for treatment outweighs the risks and side effects. 
The amendment clarifies that the patient or the patient's designated representative 
may request that the treatment authorization be terminated early by filing a request with 
the department that demonstrates that there is a significant change to the conditions that 
led to the original order or the patient's medical condition. If the hearing officer 
determines that a hearing on the request is warranted, then the patient must be provided 
counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services'expense at least 7 days before 
the hearing. If the hearing officer recommends termination of the treatment authorization 
to the commissioner, the commissioner must either order the termination or deny the 
request for termination within 48 hours of the recommendation. 
This amendment adds a new section that clarifies that the court may order an 
independent psychiatric or medical examination to make a determination under the bill. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts is directed to request that the Department of 
Health and Human Services reimburse the full amount of fees paid to the providers of the 
examinations. The Department of Health and Human Services is directed to reimburse 
the Judicial Department within 30 days after the request.
