SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to increase funding to the ConnectME Authority from $1,000,000 5 
to $5,000,000 to expand universal  broadband and high -speed Internet into rural areas 6 
identified as the 6% of the State unserved by high -speed Internet.  This bill proposes to 7 
make expanding high -speed Internet into unserved rural areas a key emphasis in the 8 
economic development of and to multiply the return to the State by directing the 9 
ConnectME Authority to use the increased funding to increase the rate of strategic 10 
broadband investment and leverage additional federal funding to provide middle -mile and 11 
last-mile infrastructure in the uns erved areas and to correct broadband deficiencies 12 
identified in the ConnectME Authority's baseline update of 2013.  13
