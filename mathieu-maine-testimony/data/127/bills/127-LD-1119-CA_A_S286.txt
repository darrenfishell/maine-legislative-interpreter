was mailed to the employee, except that benefits paid pursuant to section 212, 
subsection 1 or section 213, subsection 1 may be discontinued or reduced based

hearing by a hearing offieer an administrative law judge, the hearing Offi60f 
administrative law judge may order one of the following: 
A. If the employer can not show cause why the employee should not commence or 
continue treatment with the health care provider of the employee's choice, the heariag 
offieer administrative law judge shall order that the employer is responsible for 
payment for treatment received from the health care provider; or 
B. If the employer can show cause why the employee should not commence or 
continue treatment with the health care provider of the employee's choice, the hearing 
offieer administrative law judge shall order that the employer is not responsible and 
that the employee is responsible for payment for treatment received from the health 
care provider from the date the order is mailed. 
Sec. 7. 39-A MRSA §207, first~, as amended by PL 2001, c. 278, §1, is further 
amended to read: 
An employee being treated by a health care provider of the employee's own choice 
shall, after an injury and at all reasonable times during the continuance of disability if so 
requested by the employer, submit to an examination by a physician, surgeon or 
chiropractor authorized to practice as such under the laws of this State, to be selected and 
paid by the employer. The physician, surgeon or chiropractor must have an active 
practice of treating patients. For purposes of this section, "active practice" may be 
demonstrated by having active clinical privileges at a hospital. A physician or surgeon 
must be certified in the field of practice that treats the type of injury complained of by the 
employee. Certification must be by a board recognized by the American Board of 
Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association or their successor 
organizations. A chiropractor licensed by the Board of Chiropractic Licensure, who has 
an active practice of treating patients may provide a 2nd opinion when the initial opinion 
was given by a chiropractor. Once an employer selects a health care provider to examine 
an employee, the employer may not request that the employee be examined by more than 
one other health care provider, other than an independent medical examiner appointed 
pursuant to section 312, without prior approval from the employee or a heariag offieor an 
administrative law judge. This provision does not limit an employer's right to request that 
the employee be examined by a specialist upon referral by the health care provider. Once 
the employee is examined by the specialist, the employer may not request that the 
employee be examined by a different specialist in the same specialty, other than an 
independent medical examiner appointed pursuant to section 312, without prior approval 
from the employee or the board. The employee has the right to have a physician, surgeon 
or chiropractor of the employee's own selection present at such an examination, whose 
costs are paid by the employer. The employer shall give the employee notice of this right 
at the time the employer requests an examination. 
Sec. 8. 39-A MRSA §213, sub-§l, as repealed and replaced by PL 2011, c. 647, 
§ 7, is amended to read:

data regarding independent medical examiners and examinations. 
Sec. 24. Transition. A Workers' Compensation Board hearing officer serving on

administrative law judge on the same terms and conditions of employment as existed on 
the day prior to the effective date of this Act and has the same authority to hear and 
decide cases as existed prior to the effective date of this Act. A Workers' Compensation 
Board hearing officer serving on the effective date of this Act who is not admitted to the 
practice of law in Maine remains a hearing officer on the same terms and conditions of 
employment as existed on the day prior to the effective date of this Act and, 
notwithstanding any provision oflaw to the contrary, is considered an administrative law 
judge for all purposes under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 39-A and has all of the 
rights, responsibilities, duties and authority that existed prior to the effective date of this 
Act. The term "hearing officer," as used in Title 39-A prior to the effective date of this 
Act, is coextensive with the term "administrative law judge," used subsequent to the

compensation laws. 
1. It maintains the provision in the bill that provides that an employer may report 
wages of an employee to the Workers' Compensation Board in the same manner as the 
employee is paid and adds that an employer is not required to report lost time to the 
Workers' Compensation Board beyond 14 days for an injured employee who has returned 
to work and subsequently attended medical appointments if the employee did not lose 
wages for attending such appointments. 
2. It requires the Workers' Compensation Board to inform the Maine Insurance 
Guaranty Association of the association's responsibilities under the Maine Workers' 
Compensation Act of 1992 within 180 days. 
3. It changes the job title of hearing officer to administrative law judge, except for 
any hearing officer currently serving who is not admitted to the practice of law in Maine. 
4. It requires the Workers' Compensation Board to develop rules in regards to the 
timing and deadlines for independent medical examiner examinations and directs the 
Workers' Compensation Board to annually report data regarding these examinations to 
the Legislature.
