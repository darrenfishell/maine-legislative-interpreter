Committee: Insurance and Financial Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Any additional costs to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation to adopt the changes in this bill are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
The Department of Administrative and Financial Services does not believe this will have any direct impact on the 
claims or premiums paid by the Anthem vision plan for state employees. However, this could have an impact on the 
out-of-pocket expenditures for members insured by the State's plan.
