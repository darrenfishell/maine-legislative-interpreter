The amendment removes the appropriations and allocations to the Department of Health and Human Services in fiscal 
year 2015-16 due to a new effective date for the rule change. It also reduces the General Fund appropriation by 
$754,568 in fiscal year 2016-17 by cutting in half the increases in the original bill for the personal needs allowances 
of residents in residential care facilities from a $20 increase to a $10 increase (for a new total of $80) and for residents 
in nursing facilities from a $10 increase to a $5 increase (for a new total of $45). Federal Expenditures Fund 
allocations are also reduced for the lower additional matching federal revenue expected.
