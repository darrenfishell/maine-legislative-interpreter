2.  Statewide drug -free workplace model policy.  The Commissioner of Labor shall 27 
establish a single, comprehensive statewide drug -free workplac e model policy to be 28 
managed by the Department of Labor.  The model policy must be in compliance with all 29 
pertinent rules and regulations for employers conducting substance abuse testing.  The 30 
model policy must be posted on the bureau's publicly accessible  website.   Before 31 
establishing any substance abuse testing program, an employer must develop or, as 32 
required in section 684, subsection 3, paragraph C, must appoint an employee committee 33 
to develop a written policy in compliance with this subchapter provid ing adopt the model 34 
policy, except that an employer may retain its workplace policy approved under former 35 
section 686 until June 30, 2016 if the workplace policy was approved prior to the 36 
establishment of the model policy and is as stringent as or more str ingent than the model 37 
policy.  Effective July 1, 2016, all employers shall adopt the model policy.  The 38 
department shall treat all employers that adopt the model policy as having the same 39 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 workplace substance abuse testing policy.  The model policy must pro vide for, at a 1 
minimum:  2 
A.  The procedure and consequences of an employee's voluntary admission of a 3 
substance abuse problem and any available assistance , including the availability and 4 
procedure of the employer's employee assistance program ; 5 
B.  When subs tance abuse testing may occur. The written  model  policy must 6 
describe:  7 
(1)  Which positions, if any, will be  are subject to testing, including any positions 8 
subject to random or arbitrary testing under section 684, subsection 3.  For 9 
applicant testing and probable cause testing of employees, an employer may 10 
designate that all positions are subject to testing; and  11 
(2)  The procedure to be followed in selecting employees to be tested on a 12 
random or arbitrary basis under section 684, subsection 3;  13 
C.  The coll ection of samples.  14 
(1)  The collection of any sample for use in a substance abuse test must be 15 
conducted in a medical facility and supervised by a licensed physician or nurse.  16 
A medical facility includes a first aid station located at the work site.  17 
(2)  An employer may not require an employee or applicant to remove any 18 
clothing for the purpose of collecting a urine sample, except that:  19 
(a)  An employer may require that an employee or applicant leave any 20 
personal belongings other than clothing and any unne cessary coat, jacket or 21 
similar outer garments outside the collection area; or  22 
(b)  If it is the standard practice of an off -site medical facility to require the 23 
removal of clothing when collecting a urine sample for any purpose, the 24 
physician or nurse sup ervising the collection of the sample in that facility 25 
may require the employee or applicant to remove their the employee's or the 26 
applicant's  clothing.  27 
(3)  No employee or applicant may be required to provide a urine sample while 28 
being observed, directly or indirectly, by another individual.  29 
(4)  The employer may take additional actions necessary to ensure the integrity of 30 
a urine sample if the sample collector or testing laboratory determines that the 31 
sample may have been substituted, adulterated, diluted  or otherwise tampered 32 
with in an attempt to influence test results.  The Department of Health and 33 
Human Services shall adopt rules governing when those additional actions are 34 
justified and the scope of those actions.  These rules may not permit the direct  or 35 
indirect observation of the collection of a urine sample.  If an employee or 36 
applicant is found to have twice substituted, adulterated, diluted or otherwise 37 
tampered with the employee's or applicant's urine sample, as determined under 38 
the rules adopted  by the department, the employee or applicant is deemed to have 39 
refused to submit to a substance abuse test.  40

 (5)  If the employer proposes to use the type of screening test described in section 1 
682, subsection 7, paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the employer 's policy must 2 
include:  3 
(a)  Procedures to ensure the confidentiality of test results as required in 4

custody and complying with other applicable provisions of this subchapter;  8 
D.  The storage of samples before testing sufficient to inhibit deterioration of the 9 
sample;  10 
E.  The chain of custody of samples sufficient to protect the  sample from tampering 11 
and to verify the identity of each sample and test result;  12 
F.  The substances of abuse to be tested for;  13 
G.  The cutoff levels for both screening and confirmation tests at which the presence 14 
of a substance of abuse in a sample is con sidered a positive test result.  15 
(1)  Cutoff levels for confirmation tests for marijuana may not be lower than 15 16 
nanograms of delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol -9-carboxylic acid per milliliter for 17 
urine samples.  18 
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt rules under 19 
section 687 regulating screening and confirmation cutoff levels for other 20 
substances of abuse, including those substances tested for in blood samples under 21 
subsection 5, paragraph B, to ensure that levels are set within known tolera nces 22 
of test methods and above mere trace amounts.  An employer may request that 23 
the Department of Health and Human Services establish a cutoff level for any 24 
substance of abuse for which the department has not established a cutoff level.  25 
(3)  Notwithstandi ng subparagraphs (1) and (2), if the Department of Health and 26 
Human Services does not have established cutoff levels or procedures for any 27 
specific federally recognized substance abuse test, the minimum cutoff levels and 28

positive result may appeal and contest the accuracy of that result.  The policy must 36 
include a mechani sm that provides an opportunity to appeal at no cost to the 37 
appellant; and  38 
L.  Any other matters required by rules adopted by the Department of Labor under 39 
section 687.  40 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 An employer must consult with the employer's employees in the development of any 1 
portio n of a substance abuse testing policy under this subsection that relates to the 2 
employees.  The employer is not required to consult with the employees on those portions 3 
of a policy that relate only to applicants.  The employer shall send a copy of the fina l 4 
written policy to the Department of Labor for review under section 686.  The employer 5 
may not implement the policy until the Department of Labor approves the policy.  The 6 
employer shall send a copy of any proposed change in an approved written policy to the 7 
Department of Labor for review under section 686.  The employer may not implement the 8 
change until the Department of Labor approves the change  adoption of the model policy . 9 
Sec. A -5.  26 MRSA §683, sub -§3, as amended by PL 1995, c. 324, §5, is further 10 
amended to read:  11

with a copy of the written policy approved by the Department of Labor under section 686  13 
publish on a portion of its website that is accessible to employees t he employer's 14 
workplace substance abuse testing policy adopted pursuant to this section  at least 30 days 15 
before any portion of the written  policy applicable to employees takes effect.  The 16 
employer shall provide each employee with a copy of any change in a  written policy 17 
approved by the Department of Labor under section 686 at least 60 days before any 18 
portion of the change applicable to employees takes effect.  The Department of Labor 19 
may waive the 60 -day notice for the implementation of an amendment coveri ng 20 
employees if the amendment was necessary to comply with the law or if, in the judgment 21 
of the department, the amendment promotes the purpose of the law and does not lessen 22 
the protection of an individual employee.   If an employer intends to test an appl icant, the 23 
employer shall provide  inform  the applicant with a copy of the written policy under 24 
subsection 2 before administering a substance abuse test to the applicant.  The 30 -day and 25 
60-day notice periods provided for employees under this subsection do not apply to 26 
applicants  that the employer's workplace substance abuse testing policy adopted pursuant 27 
to this section can be located on the bureau's website . 28 
Sec. A -6.  26 MRSA §683, sub -§5, ¶B, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 536, §§1 and 2 29

certifi ed by the Department of Health and Human Services to draw blood samples.  34 
The employer shall have this sample tested for the presence of alcohol or marijuana 35 
metabolites, if those substances are to be tested for under the employer's written  36 
workplace subst ance abuse testing  policy.  If the employee requests that a blood 37 
sample be taken as provided in this paragraph, the employer may not test any other 38 
sample from the employee for the presence of these substances.  39 
(1)  The Department of Health and Human Serv ices may identify, by rules 40 
adopted under section 687, other substances of abuse for which an employee may 41 
request a blood sample be tested instead of a urine sample if the department 42 
determines that a sufficient correlation exists between the presence of the 43 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 substance in an individual's blood and its effect upon the individual's 1 
performance.  2 
(2)  No employer may require, request or suggest that any employee or applicant 3 
provide a blood sample for substance abuse testing purposes nor may any 4 
employer conduc t a substance abuse test upon a blood sample except as provided 5

(1)  An employer may establish a testing program under this paragraph only if the 16 
employer has 50 or more employees who are not covered by a collective 17 
bargaining a greement.  18 
(2)  The written policy required by section 683, subsection 2 with respect to a 19 
testing program under this paragraph must be developed by a committee of at 20 
least 10 of the employer's employees.  The employer shall appoint members to 21 
the committee  from a cross -section of employees who are eligible to be tested.  22 
The committee must include a medical professional who is trained in procedures 23 
for testing for substances of abuse.  If no such person is employed by the 24 
employer, the employer shall obtain  the services of such a person to serve as a 25 
member of the committee created under this subparagraph.  26 
(3)  The written policy developed under subparagraph (2)  employer's workplace 27 
substance abuse testing policy  must also require that selection of employees  for 28 
testing be performed by a person or entity not subject to the employer's influence, 29 
such as a medical review officer.  Selection must be made from a list, provided 30

obtain from the Department of Labor approval of the policy developed by the 39 
employee  committee, as required in section 686.  If the employer does not 40 
approve of the written policy developed by the employee committee, the 41 
employer may decide not to submit the policy to the department and not to 42 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 establish the testing program.  The employer may not change the written policy 1 
without approval of the employee committee.  2 
(6)  The employer may not discharge, suspend, demote, discipline or otherwise 3 
discriminate with regard to compensation or working conditions against an 4 
employee for participating  or refusing to participate in an employee committee 5 
created pursuant to this paragraph.  6 
Sec. A -9.  26 MRSA §684, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 536, §§1 and 2 and 7 
affected by c. 604, §§2 and 3, is amended to read:  8 
4.  Testing while undergoing rehabilit ation or treatment.   While the employee is 9

contact with or mandatory referral to the employer's employee assistance program  11 
consent  or after a confirmed positive resu lt as provided in section 685, subsection 2, 12 
paragraphs B and C, substance abuse testing may be conducted by the rehabilitation or 13 
treatment provider as required, requested or suggested by that provider.  14 
A.  Substance abuse testing conducted as part of such a rehabilitation or treatment 15 
program is not subject to the provisions of this subchapter regulating substance abuse 16 
testing.  17 
B.  An employer may not require, request or suggest that any substance abuse test be 18 
administered to any employee while the empl oyee is undergoing such rehabilitation 19 
or treatment, except as provided in subsections 2 and 3.  20 
C.  The results of any substance abuse test administered to an employee as part of 21 
such a rehabilitation or treatment program may not be released to the employe r. 22 
Sec. A -10.  26 MRSA §685, sub -§2, ¶C, as amended by PL 1995, c. 344, §1, is 23 
further amended to read:  24 
C.  If the employee chooses not to participate in a rehabilitation program under this 25 
subsection, the employer may take any action described in paragrap h A.  If the 26 
employee chooses to participate in a rehabilitation program, the following provisions 27 
apply.  28 
(1)  If the employer has an employee assistance program that offers counseling or 29 
rehabilitation services, the employee may choose to enter that progr am at the 30 
employer's expense.  If these services are not available from an employer's 31 
employee assistance program or if the employee chooses not to participate in that 32 
program, the employee may enter a public or private rehabilitation program.  33 
(a)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 34 
plan, the costs of the public or private rehabilitation program must be equally 35 
divided between the employer and  are the responsibility of the  employee if 36 
the employer has more than 20 full -time employees .  This requirement does 37 
not apply to municipalities or other political subdivisions of the State or to 38 
any employer when the employee is tested because of the alcohol and 39 
controlled substance testing mandated by the federal Omnibus Transporta tion 40 
Employee Testing Act of 1991, Public Law 102 -143, Title V.  If necessary, 41 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 the employer shall assist in financing the cost share of the employee through 1 
a payroll deduction plan.  2 
(b)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insura nce 3 
plan, an employer with 20 or fewer full -time employees, a municipality or 4 
other political subdivision of the State is not required to pay for any costs of 5 
rehabilitation or treatment under any public or private rehabilitation program.  6 
An employer is n ot required to pay for the costs of rehabilitation if the 7 
employee was tested because of the alcohol and controlled substance testing 8 
mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 9 
1991, Public Law 102 -143, Title V.  10 
(2)  No employer  may take any action described in paragraph A while an 11 
employee is participating in a rehabilitation program, except as provided in 12 
subparagraph (2 -A) and except that an employer may change the employee's 13 
work assignment or suspend the employee from active  duty to reduce any 14 
possible safety hazard.  Except as provided in subparagraph (2 -A), an employee's 15 
pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee is participating in a 16 
rehabilitation program, provided  except  that the employer is not required to pay  17 
the employee for periods in which the employee is unavailable for work for the 18 
purposes of rehabilitation or while the employee is medically disqualified.  The 19 
employee may apply normal sick leave and vacation time, if any, for these 20 
periods.  21 
(2-A)  A reh abilitation or treatment provider shall promptly notify the employer 22 
if the employee fails to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation program before 23 
the expiration of the 6 -month period provided in paragraph B.  Upon receipt of 24 
this notice, the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.  25 
(3)  Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 26 
rehabilitation program, as determined by the rehabilitation or treatment provider 27 
after consultation with the employer, the emp loyee is entitled to return to the 28 
employee's previous job with full pay and benefits unless conditions unrelated to 29 
the employee's previous confirmed positive result make the employee's return 30 
impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must not conflict w ith any provision 31 
of a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and a labor 32 
organization that is the collective bargaining representative of the unit of which 33 
the employee is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or treatment provider 34 
determines that the employee has not successfully completed the rehabilitation 35 
program within 6 months after starting the program, the employer may take any 36 
action described in paragraph A.  37 
(a)  If the employee who has completed rehabilitation previously worke d in 38 
an employment position subject to random or arbitrary testing under an 39 
employer's written  workplace substance abuse testing  policy adopted under 40 
section 683, subsection 2 , the employer may refuse to allow the employee to 41 
return to the previous job if the employer believes that the employee may 42 
pose an unreasonable safety hazard because of the nature of the position.  43 
The employer shall attempt to find suitable work for the employee 44 
immediately after refusing the employee's return to the previous positi on.  No 45 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR1173(01) -1 
 reduction may be made in the employee's previous benefits or rate of pay 1 
while awaiting reassignment to work or while working in a position other 2 
than the previous job.  The employee shall  must  be reinstated to the previous 3 
position or to another p osition with an equivalent rate of pay and benefits and 4 
with no loss of seniority within 6 months after returning to work in any 5 
capacity with the employer unless the employee has received a subsequent 6 
confirmed positive result within that time from a test  administered under this 7 
subchapter or unless conditions unrelated to the employee's previous 8 
confirmed positive test result make that reinstatement or reassignment 9 
impossible.  Placement of the employee in suitable work and reinstatement 10 
may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement 11 
between the employer and a labor organization that is the collective 12 
bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or would be a 13 
part. 14 
(b)  Notwithstanding division (a), if an employe e who has successfully 15 
completed rehabilitation is medically disqualified, the employer is not 16 
required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 17 
during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not required to 18 
compensate the employee during the period of disqualification.  Immediately 19 
after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 20 
obligations under division (a) attach  commence  as if the employee had 21 
successfully completed rehabilitation on that date.  22

SUMMARY  15 
Current law requ ires employers that want to provide a drug -free workplace by testing 16 
applicants or employees for substance abuse to develop and file a policy with the 17 
Department of Labor.  The Bureau of Labor Standards reviews the policies to ensure 18 
compliance with state laws and rules. This bill provides employers with a single, 19 
consistent model policy. The model policy, which is established by the Commissioner of 20 
Labor and managed by the department, is intended to encourage greater participation by 21
