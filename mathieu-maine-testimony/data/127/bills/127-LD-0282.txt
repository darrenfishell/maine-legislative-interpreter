 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the value of property within a municipality is a major factor in the 3 
calculation of munici pal revenue sharing and general purpose aid for local schools; and  4 
Whereas, the Town of Madison derives a large portion of its tax valuation from the 5 
presence of the Madison Paper Company, and the Town of Skowhegan derives a large 6 
portion of its tax valuat ion from the presence of the S.D. Warren Company; and  7 
Whereas, between the 2013 and 2014 tax years, the value of the Madison Paper 8 
Company has been reduced by $149,700,000, representing 65% of its taxable value, and 9 
the value of the S.D. Warren Company has  been reduced by $100,000,000, representing 10 
18% of its taxable value, as a result of the weakness in the market for printed paper 11 
products; and  12 
Whereas, prior to this decrease, the Madison Paper Company represented 13 
approximately 40% of the tax base of the Town of Madison, and the S.D. Warren 14 
Company represented approximately 9.5% of the tax base of the Town of Skowhegan; 15 
and 16 
Whereas, unless immediate action is taken to account for this decrease in valuation, 17 
the Town of Madison and the Town of Skowhegan wil l experience the loss of significant 18 
revenues based on the decreased valuation of the Madison Paper Company and the S.D. 19 
Warren Company; and  20 
Whereas, in the absence of legislative action, the state valuation of the Town of 21 
Madison and the Town of Skowhegan  will not be adjusted to reflect this significant 22 
reduction in value for 2 years; and  23 
Whereas, in the absence of legislative action, the distribution of general purpose aid 24 
for local schools to Regional School Unit No. 59, a school unit composed entirely o f the 25 
Town of Madison, and to Regional School Unit No. 54, a school unit composed of the 26 
towns of Skowhegan, Canaan, Cornville, Mercer, Smithfield and Norridgewock, will be 27 
calculated on the basis of an inaccurate equalized valuation for at least 3 years; and 28 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 29 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 30 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now , 31 
therefore,  32 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  33 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §15672, sub -§23, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 203, §1, is 34 
amended to read:  35 
C.  For fiscal year 2015 -16 and each subsequent fiscal year, the average of the 36 
certif ied state valuations for the 3 most recent years prior to the most recently 37 
certified state valuation , except that, for a municipality that has experienced a net 38 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0174(01) -1 
 reduction in equalized municipal valuation of at least 2% from the equalized 1 
municipal valuati on of the previous year, "property fiscal capacity" means the most 2 
recently certified state valuation . 3 
Sec. 2.  Modify 2015 state valuations.   Notwithstanding the Maine Revised 4 
Statutes, Title 36, the 2015 state valuations for the Town of Madison and the T own of 5 
Skowhegan for the purposes of calculating state -municipal revenue -sharing funds and the 6 
distribution of general purpose aid for local schools must be based on a valuation that 7 
values the property of the Madison Paper Company in the Town of Madison a t 8 
$80,000,000 and values the property of the S.D. Warren Company in the Town of 9 
Skowhegan at $463,224,200.  10 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 11 
legislation takes effect when approved.  12 
SUMMARY  13 
Current law provides that the  property fiscal capacity of a municipality for purposes 14 
of determining school funding under the Essential Programs and Services Funding Act is 15 
the average of the certified state valuations for the 3 most recent years prior to the most 16 
recently certified s tate valuation.  This bill provides an exception for a municipality that 17 
has experienced a net reduction in equalized municipal valuation of at least 2% from the 18 
previous year that sets the property fiscal capacity at the most recently certified state 19 
valuation.  20 
It also provides that the 2015 state valuation for the Town of Madison for the 21 
purposes of calculating state -municipal revenue -sharing funds and the distribution of 22 
general purpose aid for local schools must be based on a valuation that values the 23 
property of the Madison Paper Company in the Town of Madison at $80,000,000 and the 24 
property of the S.D. Warren Company in the Town of Skowhegan at $463,224,200.  25
