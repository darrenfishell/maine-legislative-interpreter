Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill creates a local sales tax increment to be paid annually to each municipality equal to 5% of the amount that 
sales tax collections in each municipality exceed the collections of the base fiscal year of 20 16-17. The base year 
would change every 4 years. Any year collections are below those of the base year no payments would be made. The 
first payments would be in fiscal year 2018-19 and would reduce General Fund revenue by $2,183,020 and reduce 
Local Government Fund revenue by $114,896.
