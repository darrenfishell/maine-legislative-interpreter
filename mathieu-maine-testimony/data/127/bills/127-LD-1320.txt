SUMMARY  22 
This bill amends the motor vehicle laws to:  23 
1.  Increase the gross weight requirements for pickup trucks from 6,000 pounds to 24 
10,000 pound s so pickup trucks under 10,001 pounds can be registered with passenger - 25 
type plates;  26 
2.  Increase the registration fee for antique autos from $15 to $30;  27 
3.  Discontinue the muffler bypass permit as this permit is obsolete;  28 
4.  Clarify that the cancellatio n fee for all commercial examinations, including a 29 
Class C commercial examination, is $30;  30 
5.  Increase the fee for duplicate learner's permits from $2 to $5 to support the costs 31 
associated with issuance.  A federal rule effective July 8, 2015 requires tha t a commercial 32 
driver's license permit be issued with the same security features as a base license. This 33 
will require a card -type permit to be issued with the same associated costs for production; 34 
and 35 
6.  Apply the same requirements of driving time needed in order to be eligible for a 36 
special restricted license for educational and employment needs as exists in current law 37 
for medical needs.  38 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR0575(01) -1 
 This bill also makes the operation of a motor vehicle while having a delta -9- 1 
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, level of 5 nanograms or more per milliliter of blood a 2 
criminal offense, authorizes the Secretary of State to suspend administratively the license 3 
of a person who operates a motor vehicle with a THC level of 5 nanograms or more per 4 
milliliter of blood and sanctions t he use of approved preliminary breath -testing devices by 5 
law enforcement officers in determining whether a person operated a motor vehicle under 6 
the influence of intoxicants.  7
