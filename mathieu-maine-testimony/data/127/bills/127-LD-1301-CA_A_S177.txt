15 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" 11 "to S,p, 466, L.D, 1301 
1, It changes the definition of "vulnerable user" in the bill to remove motorcycles and 
to clarify that "vulnerable user" includes persons who are more vulnerable to injury than 
those in an automobile, truck or similar motor vehicle, 
2, Like the bill, it requires that driver education courses include instruction regarding 
sharing the road with a vulnerable user, but the amendment eliminates the requirement in 
the bill that instruction include at least 30 minutes, 
3, It strikes from the bill the provisions regarding pedestrians in crosswalks and 
instead adds new language to existing statute to specify that operators must yield the 
right-of-way to pedestrians who have shown visible intent to enter the marked crosswalk, 
4, It retains provisions in the bill regarding responsibilities of bicyclists that are like 
responsibilities of motor vehicle operators but consolidates most of these provisions in 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29-A, section 2063, which addresses the rights and 
duties of bicyclists, 
5, It strikes all proposed new prohibitions and penalties regarding vulnerable users, 
as the conduct and penalties are covered by current law in Titles l7-A and 29-A.
