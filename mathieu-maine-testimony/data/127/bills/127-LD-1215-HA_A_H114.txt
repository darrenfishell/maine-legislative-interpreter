§§ 10 to 13, is further amended to read: 
4. Triennial plan. The board shall vote on a detailed, triennial, energy efficiency, 
alternative energy resources and conservation plan that includes the quantifiable measures 
of performance developed under subsection 3 and make a full report of the vote to the 
commission in accordance with this subsection. The triennial plan must provide 
integrated planning, program design and implementation strategies for all energy 
efficiency, alternative energy resources and conservation programs administered by the 
trust, including but not limited to the electric efficiency and conservation programs under 
section 10110, the natural gas efficiency and conservation programs under section 10 111, 
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 10109, the Heating 
Fuels Efficiency and Weatherization Fund under section 10119 and any state or federal 
funds or publicly directed funds accepted by or allocated to the trust for the purposes of 
this chapter. The triennial plan must include provisions for the application of appropriate 
program funds to support workforce development efforts that are consistent with and 
promote the purposes of the trust. Beginning January 1, 2011, the triennial plan must 
specify the appropriate participation of the State in national and regional carbon markets. 
The plan must be consistent with the comprehensive state energy plan pursuant to Title 2, 
section 9 10205, subsection 3, paragraph C z.. 
A. The triennial plan must be developed by the trust, in consultation with entities and 
agencies engaged in delivering efficiency programs in the State, to authorize and 
govern or coordinate implementation of energy efficiency and weatherization 
programs in the State. The triennial plan must identify all achievable cost-effective 
energy efficiency savings and related programs that could be implemented pursuant 
to sections 10110 and 10111, the costs and benefits of such programs and the basis 
and support for such identified costs and benefits. The trust shall conduct an 
evaluation of all cost-effective potential for electrical and natural gas energy 
efficiency savings in the State at least once every 5 years. 
(1) Transmission and distribution utilities and natural gas utilities shall furnish 
data to the trust that the trust requests under this subsection to develop and 
implement the triennial plan or conduct the evaluation of all cost-effective 
potential for electrical and natural gas energy efficiency savings subject to such 
confidential treatment as a utility may request and the board determines 
appropriate pursuant to section 10106. The costs of providing the data are 
deemed reasonable and prudent expenses of the utilities and are recoverable in 
rates.

energy efficiency targets in paragraph F and reflects the best practices of program 
administration under subsection 2. The plan must include, but is not limited to, 
efficiency and conservation program budget allocations, objectives, targets, measures 
of performance, program designs, program implementation strategies, timelines and 
other relevant information. 
D. Prior to submission of the triennial plan to the commission, the trust shall offer to 
provide a detailed briefing on the draft plan to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over energy matters and, at the request of the 
committee, shall provide such a briefing and opportunity for input from the 
committee. After providing such opportunity for input and making any changes as a 
result of any input received, the board shall deliver the plan to the commission for its 
review and approval. The commission shall open an adjudicatory proceeding and 
issue an order either approving the plan and issuing the appropriate orders to 
transmission and distribution utilities and gas utilities or rejecting the plan and stating 
the reasons for the rejection. The commission shall reject elements of the plan that 
propose to use funds generated pursuant to sections 3210-C, 10110, 10111 or 10119 
if the plan fails to reasonably explain how these elements of the program would 
achieve the objectives and implementation requirements of the programs established 
under those sections or the measures of performance under subsection 3. Funds 
generated under these statutory authorities may not be used pursuant to the triennial 
plan unless those elements of the plan proposing to use the funds have been approved 
by the commission. The commission shall approve all elements of the triennial plan 
it determines to be cost-effective, reliable and achievable and shall incorporate into 
gas utility and transmission and distribution rates sufficient revenue to provide for the 
procurement of energy efficiency resources identified within the plan pursuant to 
section 10110, subsection 4-A and section 10111, subsection 2. The commission shall 
approve or reject the p,ntire plan or elements of thp, plan within 120 days of its 
delivery to the commission. The hoard: within 30 days of final commission approvai 
of its plan, shall submit the plan to the joint· standing committee of the Legislature 
having jurisdiction over energy matters together with any explanatory or other 
supporting material as the committee may request and, at the request of the 
committee, shall provide a detailed briefing on the final plan. After receipt of the 
plan, the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over energy 
matters may submit legislation relating to the plan. 
E. The trust shall determine the period to be covered by the triennial plan except that 
the period of the plan may not interfere with the delivery of any existing contracts to 
provide energy efficiency services that were previously procured pursuant to 
efficiency and conservation programs administered by the commission. 
F. It is an objective of the triennial plan to design, coordinate and integrate sustained 
energy efficiency and weatherization programs that are available to all energy 
consumers in the State and to users of all fuel types. The plan must set forth the costs 
and benefits of energy efficiency programs that advance the following goals, and 
funding necessary to meet those goals: 
(1) Reducing energy costs, including residential heating costs;

to participate in and share the costs of cost-effective home weatherization to a 
minimum standard of weatherization, as defined by the trust, by 2030; 
(3) Reducing peak-load demand for electricity through trust programs by 300 
megawatts by 2020; 
(4) By 2020, achieving electricity and natural gas program savings of at least 
20% and heating fuel savings of at least 20%, as defined in and determined 
pursuant to the measures of performance approved by the commission under 
section 10 120; 
(5) Creating stable private sector jobs providing alternative energy and energy 
efficiency products and services in the State by 2020; and 
(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the heating and cooling of buildings 
in the State by amounts consistent with the State's goals established in Title 38, 
section 576. 
The trust shall preserve when possible and appropriate the opportunity for carbon 
emission reductions to be monetized and sold into a voluntary carbon market. Any 
program of the trust that supports weatherization of buildings must be voluntary and 
may not constitute a mandate that would prevent the sale of emission reductions 
generated through weatherization measures into a voluntary carbon market. 
Except when specifically provided in the individual goals under this paragraph, the 
trust may consider expected savings from market effects not attributable to the trust 
as well as efforts by other organizations, including but not limited to federally funded 
low-income weatherization programs. 
As used in this paragraph, "heating fuel" means liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene or 
#2 heating oil, but does not include fuels when used for industrial or manufacturing
