This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $46,467 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $54,972 in fiscal year 2016-17 
to the Regulation and Enforcement pro grain within the Department of Labor for one half-time Labor and Safety 
Inspector position and related All Other costs associated with the additional enforcement activity expected to occur as 
a result of this legislation. 
According to the Department of Labor, increasing the penalty to employers that violate the employment leave for 
victims of violence law to include the requirement that employers pay liquidated damages or reinstate affected 
individuals with back wages if that individual was tenninated will result in more complaints being filed that will 
require more enforcement activity by the Bureau of Labor Standards. 
Increasing the penalty that may be assessed for a violation from $200 per violation to $1,000 per violation may result 
in increased General Fund revenue from penalties. The amount will depend on actual experience.
