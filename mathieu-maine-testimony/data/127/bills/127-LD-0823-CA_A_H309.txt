This bill repeals the authority of municipalities to issue concealed weapons permits, increases the application fees, 
increases the pennit tenn from 4 to 5 years and establishes a centralized database of concealed handgun pennit 
holders and applicants within the Department of Public Safety. Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the 
department would increase by $404,700 and General Fund revenue would increase by $58,470 in fiscal year 2016-17. 
The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $404,700 for 4 Office Associate II positions, 2 State 
Police Detective positions and related administrative costs, including a one-time cost of $260,000 for computer 
programming costs associated with the centralized database. In fiscal year 2016-17, the dedicated revenue is 
insufficient to cover the costs, therefore the bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the department of $147,373 
in fiscal year 2016-17.
