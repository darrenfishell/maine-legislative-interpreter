COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 593, L.D. 1531 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the bill but continues to provide that victims of aggravated 
3 sex trafficking and sex trafficking are eligible to file for protection from abuse orders and 
4 protection from harassment orders. It also provides that individuals convicted of sex 
5 trafficking are eligible for probation. 
6 This amendment replaces the bill to capture all provisions of the protection from 
7 harassment and protection from abuse laws to include protections for victims of both 
8 aggravated sex trafficking and sex trafficking. 
9 The amendment amends the definition of "harassment" to include a single act or 
10 course of conduct that includes a violation of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, 
11 section 852, aggravated sex trafficking, or section 853, sex trafficking. The definition is 
12 important because it determines who can request a protection from harassment order. 
13 The bill includes only aggravated sex trafficking in the definition of "harassment." 
14 It amends the protection from harassment laws to include as prohibited conduct that 
15 an interim protection from harassment order issued ex parte may prohibit a defendant's 
16 destroying, transferring or tampering with a plaintiffs passport or other immigration 
17 document that is in the defendant's possession. 
18 It amends the protection from harassment laws to include as prohibited conduct that, 
19 after the opportunity for a hearing, a final protection from harassment order may prohibit 
20 a defendant's destroying, transferring or tampering with a plaintiffs passport or other 
21 immigration document that is in the defendant's possession. 
22 It provides that violation of the final protection order provision prohibiting a 
23 defendant's destroying, transferring or tampering with a plaintiff's passport or other 
24 immigration document is treated as a violation of a court order, which may be pursued as 
25 contempt. 
26 It amends the Maine Criminal Code to provide that sex trafficking is a crime for 
27 which probation may be included as part of a sentence. 
28 It amends the protection from abuse laws to amend the definition of "abuse" to 
29 include the actions of engaging in aggravated sex trafficking and sex trafficking. 
30 It amends the protection from abuse laws to clarify that a victim of aggravated sex 
31 trafficking or sex trafficking may file a complaint seeking a protection from abuse order. 
32 The bill includes only aggravated sex trafficking. 
33 It amends the protection from abuse laws governing the type of relief that may be 
34 included in an interim protection from abuse order to cover a defendant's destroying, 
35 transferring or tampering with the plaintiffs passport or other immigration document. 
36 It amends the protection from abuse laws to provide that, with regard to conduct 
37 described as aggravated sex trafficking or sex trafficking, the court may order the 
38 defendant to pay economic damages related to the return or restoration of the plaintiff's 
39 passport or other immigration document and any debts of the plaintiff arising from the 
40 trafficking relationship. The amendment also provides that a defendant who violates this 
41 provision may be punished for contempt.
