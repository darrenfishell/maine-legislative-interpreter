127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 134, L.D. 176, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Law Governing the Gathering of Signatures for Direct Initiatives and People's

Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the integrity of the process for collecting signatures of direct initiative and 
people's veto referenda is paramount to the implementation of this form of direct 
democracy; and 
Whereas, the collection of signatures for new direct initiatives and potential 
people's veto referenda may occur before the 90-day period has expired; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §903-A, first " as enacted by PL 1989, c. 92, § 1, is 
amended to read:

the petition and personally witnessing the voter affixing the voter's signature to the 
petition. The circulator ofthe petition must comply with the provisions of section 902.

Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill, which imposes limitations and residency 
restrictions on circulators of petitions. The amendment clarifies the law regarding the 
solicitation of signatures for a direct initiative or a people's veto referendum. It also 
requires a petition organization that receives compensation for working on a signature­
gathering effort to submit to the Secretary of State as part of the organization's 
registration process a list containing the names of those hired by the organization, which 
must be updated when the petitions are ultimately filed with the Secretary of State.
