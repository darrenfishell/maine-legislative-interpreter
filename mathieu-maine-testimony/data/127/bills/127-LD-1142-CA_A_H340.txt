127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 780, L.D. 1142, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding the Taxation of Out-of-state Pensions" 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of paragraph 00 (page 1, lines 3 to 5 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'00. To the extent included in federal adjusted gross income, an amount equal to the 
amount of the taxpayer's contribution to an employee retirement plan or an individual 
retirement account, as those terms are defined in paragraph M-l, upon which income 
taxes have been paid to another jurisdiction. This paragraph does not apply to 
amounts deducted under paragraph M-1. For purposes of this paragraph, "another 
jurisdiction" means another state or territory of the United States, a political 
subdivision of such state or territory and the District of Columbia.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment provides that the proposed income tax exemption for certain income 
from out-of-state pensions applies only to the extent the income is included in federal 
adjusted gross income and not deducted under the general pension deduction. The 
amendment also adds a definition of "another jurisdiction."
