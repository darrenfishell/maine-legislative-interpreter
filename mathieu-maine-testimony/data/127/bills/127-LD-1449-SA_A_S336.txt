SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the laws goveming campaign finance and the Commission 
on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices. 
1. Current law requires a traditionally financed legislative candidate to file a 
declaration stating whether or not the candidate will accept voluntary spending limits. 
This amendment makes that filing optional. 
2. It provides an exemption from filing primary election campaign finance reports 
for legislative candidates who file a sworn statement with the commission stating that 
they will not conduct financial activity for the primary election. This exemption is 
available only to candidates with no opponent in the primary election and does not 
exempt candidates from filing campaign finance reports for the general election. 
3. Under current law a person, party committee or political action committee must 
file a report when making an independent expenditure in excess of $100 in a candidate's 
campaign. This amendment raises that threshold for reporting to $250.
