§1735.  Identification of toxic chemicals and highly toxic chemicals  9 
The transition team shall develop a written inventory of all chemicals, both toxic and 10 
nontoxic, that are used by emp loyees in the workplace or that are stored, located or 11 
otherwise present in the workplace.  For each identified chemical, the transition team 12 
shall determine and record whether the chemical is presently designated a toxic chemical 13 
or a highly toxic chemica l by the department.  Information developed and collected under 14 
this section must be added to the alternative chemical work plan.  15 
§1736.  Transition priorities  16 
The transition team shall develop a priority ranking of all highly toxic chemicals 17 
identified un der section 1735 for use in determining priority for transition to safer 18 
alternatives.  In developing a priority ranking, the transition team shall, at a minimum, 19 
consider for each highly toxic chemical:  20 
1.  Exposure potential.  The frequency with which em ployees are exposed to the 21 
highly toxic chemical or the likelihood of potential employee exposure to the highly toxic 22 
chemical;  23 
2.  Associated harms.  The potential harms associated with the highly toxic chemical 24 
as based on information available from the department; and  25

develop an alternatives analysis, which must:  33 
1.  Alternatives.  Identify all alternatives that can potentially and reasonably be 34 
substituted in place of the highly toxic chemical;  35 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1526(01) -1 
 2.  Impacts.  Evaluate the potential impacts of transitioning to each alternative, 1 
including, but not limited to, impacts on energy use, water use, t he environment and 2 
employee health and safety;  3 
3.  Harms.  Describe any potential harms associated with the alternative as based on 4 
information available from the department; and  5 
4.  Costs.  Provide a detailed financial analysis of the potential short -term and long - 6 
term costs of substituting each alternative.  7 
The transition team shall review the analysis developed under this section and the 8 
priority ranking developed under section 1736 and shall determine which highly toxic 9 
chemicals identified under sectio n 1735 will be tested and evaluated for transition to a 10 
safer alternative under section 1738.  Information developed and collected under this 11 
section must be added to the alternative chemical work plan.  12 
§1738.  Testing, evaluation and implementation of saf er alternatives  13 
After review of all information generated or collected under sections 1736 and 1737, 14 
the transition team shall, for each highly toxic chemical, determine whether to proceed 15 
with testing and evaluation of an alternative that the transition t eam determines a safer 16 
alternative.  The transition team shall develop and implement a process for testing and 17 
evaluating the feasibility of transition to a safer alternative.  18 
If after testing and evaluation of the safer alternative pursuant to this sectio n the 19 
transition team elects to proceed with transition on a permanent basis, the transition team 20 
shall develop and implement a process for permanent transition to the safer alternative.  If 21 
the transition team elects not to proceed with transition on a pe rmanent basis, the 22 
transition team shall record the basis for its decision and add that information, along with 23 
any other information developed and collected under this section, to the alternative 24 
chemical work plan.  25 
§1739.  Discontinuation of safer altern atives  26 
At any time following completion of the permanent transition process to a safer 27 
alternative under section 1738, the employer may determine that substitution of the safer 28 
alternative is no longer technically, financially or otherwise feasible and ele ct to 29 
discontinue use of the safer alternative.  If the employer elects to discontinue use of the 30 
safer alternative, the employer shall submit a report to the department detailing the basis 31 
for discontinuation.  Information developed and collected and repo rts submitted under 32 
this section must be added to the alternative chemical work plan.  33 
§1740.  Reporting requirements  34

SUMMARY  25 
This bill enacts the Toxic Chemicals in the Workplace Act to create a statutory and 26 
regulatory framework designed to prevent harm  to employees by reducing exposure to 27 
highly toxic chemicals in the workplace and thereby decrease the rates of cancer and 28 
other chronic diseases in the State, improve workplace chemical management and safety 29 
and ensure safer workplaces and healthier commu nities.  30 
This bill specifically:  31 
1.  Directs the Department of Labor to develop criteria for identifying toxic and 32 
highly toxic chemicals, designate all toxic and highly toxic chemicals to be regulated by 33 
the Act and publish lists of all regulated toxic and  highly toxic chemicals on its publicly 34 
accessible website;  35 
2.  Requires employers subject to the provisions of the Act to develop and implement 36 
a written alternative chemical work plan and designate a transition team to assist in 37 
transitioning from highly  toxic chemicals in the workplace to safer alternatives;  38 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1526(01) -1 
 3.  Directs the transition team to inventory all chemicals in the workplace, both toxic 1 
and nontoxic, and determine which chemicals have been designated by the department as 2 
toxic or highly toxic che micals;  3 
4.  Requires the transition team to develop a priority ranking of all identified highly 4 
toxic chemicals, based on a number of criteria, to assist in determining which chemicals 5 
will be transitioned to safer alternatives;  6 
5.  Directs the transition team, as part of developing the priority ranking, to conduct 7 
for each highly toxic chemical an alternatives analysis that includes, among other things, 8 
a detailed financial analysis of the costs of substituting an alternative;  9 
6.  Requires the transition t eam to decide which alternatives to highly toxic chemicals 10 
are safer alternatives and which safer alternatives should be tested and evaluated for 11 
permanent transition.  After testing and evaluation of selected safer alternatives, the 12 
transition team may el ect to transition to a safer alternative on a permanent basis;  13 
7.  Allows an employer, at any point after completing the transition to a safer 14 
alternative, to discontinue use of the safer alternative and report the basis for 15 
discontinuation to the departme nt; 16
