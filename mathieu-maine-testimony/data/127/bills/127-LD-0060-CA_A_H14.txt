year 2016-17 to the Teacher Retirement program within the Department of Education to fund the portion of normal

appropriations of $18,346,560 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $18,957,388 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Teacher 
Retirement program and corresponding General Fund deappropriations to the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools
