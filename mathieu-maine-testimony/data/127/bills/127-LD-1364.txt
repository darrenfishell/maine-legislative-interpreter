 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing Pine Tree Development 2 
Zones.  3 
1.  Current law authorizes Pine Tree Development Z one businesses whose primary 4 
purpose is to support the State's working waterfront to apply for adjustments based on a 5 
catastrophic occurrence.  This bill eliminates the restriction that the business be within the 6 
working waterfront industry, and allows suc h affected businesses to apply for an 7 
extension of their certification period of up to 2 years.  This bill authorizes the 8 
Department of Economic and Community Development, after consultation with the 9 
Governor, to grant extensions of certification.  10 
2.  Curr ent law defines a qualified Pine Tree Development Zone employee as an 11 
employee for whom group health insurance is provided.  This bill eliminates the 12 
requirement that group health insurance be provided.  13 
3.  Current law defines a qualified Pine Tree Develop ment Zone employee as one 14 
whose income is greater than the most recent annual per capita personal income in the 15 
county in which the qualified employee is employed.  Under this bill, the income of a 16 
qualified employee is greater than the average weekly wage  for the most recent calendar 17 
year as derived from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.  The calculation 18 
of the average weekly wage must include data from the counties of Androscoggin, 19 
Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford,  Penobscot, 20 
Piscataquis, Sagadahoc, Somerset, Waldo and Washington.  21 
4.  It amends the laws governing employment tax increment financing reimbursement 22 
to reflect the revised definition of "qualified employee" under the Pine Tree Development 23 
Zone laws.  24
