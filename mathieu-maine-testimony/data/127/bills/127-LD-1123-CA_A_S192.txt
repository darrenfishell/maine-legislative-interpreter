SUMMARY 
This amendment makes clarifying changes to the bill. It clarifies that prerecorded 
automated telephone calls and scripted live telephone calls that are political 
communications that are not paid for by a candidate must state whether the 
communication was authorized by the candidate. It provides that the reporting exemption 
in the bill that allows for an uncontested primary candidate to be exempt from certain 
reporting requirements when that candidate files a sworn and notarized notification with 
the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices stating that the candidate 
will not accept contributions or make expenditures for the primary race does not apply to 
a Maine Clean Election Act candidate. The amendment strikes a provision in the bill that 
conflicts with other provisions of campaign laws regarding the termination of campaign 
requirements. Finally, the amendment adds a new section to the bill that provides that 
when a political action committee seeks a waiver of a penalty for mitigating 
circumstances surrounding the failure to file a report or filing a report late, the statement 
the committee provides does not have to be in the form of a sworn statement. This 
addition mirrors a section in the bill that makes the same provision for party committees 
and candidates when they seek a penalty waiver.
