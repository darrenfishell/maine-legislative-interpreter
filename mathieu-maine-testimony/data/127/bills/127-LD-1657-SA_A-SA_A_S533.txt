the Office of Treasurer of State in fiscal year 2015-16 and a General Fund deappropriation of $200,000 to the Historic 
Preservation Commission in fiscal year 2015-16. 
This amendment adds the provisions of the committee amendment to LD 1505 into the bill. PL 2015, c. 267, Pt. QQQ 
expanded the educational opportunity tax credit to include consolidated loans for tax years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2016. The amendment provides that consolidated loans are eligible in tax year 2015 provided that the 
consolidated loans only include educational loans. The incremental effect of adding LD 1505 is to reduce General 
Fund revenue by $24,500 in fiscal year 2015-16 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue by $500 in fiscal year 
2015-16.
