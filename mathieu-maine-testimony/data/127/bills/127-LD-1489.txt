Public Law 2015, chapter 267 amended the education funding formula statute t o 4 
require the Commissioner of Education to disburse $75,000 over each of the fiscal years 5 
2015 -16 and 2016 -17 for postsecondary education attainment in Androscoggin County; 6 
the intent of this disbursement was to provide funding to College for ME - Androsco ggin 7 
to provide financial assistance for individuals in Androscoggin County who wanted to 8 
attend college or obtain a postsecondary degree.  Because College for ME - 9 
Androscoggin was not specifically named in the amended statute, the funds were not 10

This bill repeals the statute requiring the Commissioner of Education to disburse the 12 
funds and instead requires the State Controller to disburse $75,000 to College for ME - 13 
Androscoggin in each of the fiscal years 2015 -16 and 2016 -17.  The funds are 14 
appropriated from the General Purpose Aid for Local Schools Program General Fund 15 
account to be used to support individuals aspiring to attend college and support 16 
postsecondary degree attainment initiatives in Androscoggin County.  17
