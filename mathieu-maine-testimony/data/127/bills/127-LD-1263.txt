1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 5 
following terms have the following meanings.  6 
A.  "Eligible facility" means an electric generating facility that uses a wind power 7 
installation under section 3210, subsection 2, paragraph B -3, subparagraph (2) or a 8 
power  system producing heat and power with a total efficiency of not less than 65% 9 
as defined by rule.  10 
B.  "Net energy billing" means a billing and metering practice under which a 11 
customer is billed on the basis of net energy over the billing period taking into  12 
account accumulated unused kilowatt -hour credits from the previous billing period.  13 
C.  "Shared ownership" means ownership interest of an eligible facility by multiple 14 
persons who have distinct billing accounts with a transmission and distribution 15 
utility.  16 
2.  Net energy billing.  A customer of a transmission and distribution utility may 17

A.  An eligible facility located in an investor -owned transmission and distribution 19 
utility territory may not have an installed capac ity greater than one megawatt.  An 20 
eligible facility located in a consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility 21 
territory may not have an installed capacity greater than 100 kilowatts unless the 22 
consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility a llows an eligible facility with 23 
an installed capacity of up to one megawatt to be eligible for net energy billing.  24 
B.  An eligible facility with shared ownership is eligible for net energy billing.  The 25 
number of customers who participate in a single share d ownership eligible facility 26 
must allow for economies of scale in installation costs, except that the number may 27

meet the portfolio requirements under paragraph A and that the resulting use of 24 
renewable energy credits pursuant t o subsection 8 or the alternative compliance 25 
payment mechanism pursuant to subsection 9, or both of these methods, has 26 
burdened electricity customers in the State without providing the benefits of new 27 
renewable capacity resources, the commission may suspen d all or some of the 28 
future scheduled increases in the portfolio requirements under paragraph A.  29 
(2)  If the commission finds that alternative compliance payments are made 30 
pursuant to subsection 9 in 3 consecutive calendar years, the commission shall 31

 Page 4 - 127LR1010(01) -1 
 and compliance with the portfolio requirements under paragraph A to the joint 1 
standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over utilities and energy 2 
matters. The rep ort must include, but is not limited to, a description of new renewable 3 
capacity resources available to meet the portfolio requirements under paragraph A, 4 
documentation of the loss of any existing renewable generation capacity in the State, 5

(a)  Solar resources with less than 100 kilowatts in capacity located on low - 3 
income or median -income housing units;  4 
(b)  Solar resources eligible for shared ownership net energy billing; and  5 
(c)  Solar resources owned  by an agricultural business;  6

energy credits and to satisfy the portfolio req uirements of subsection 3 -B through the use 30 
of solar renewable energy credits  if the commission determines that a reliable system of 31 
electrical attribute trading exists. When renewable energy credits are used to satisfy the 32 
portfolio requirements of subsec tions 3 and 3 -A, the value of a renewable energy credit 33 
for electricity generated by a community -based renewable energy project, as defined in 34 
section 3602, that is participating in the community -based renewable energy pilot 35 
program established in section 3603 and elects the renewable energy credit multiplier 36 
under section 3605 is 150% of the amount of the electricity.  37 
Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub -§9, as amended by PL 2011, c. 637, §1, is 38

satisfy the portfolio requirements for new renewable capacity resources under subsection  3 
subsections  3-A and 3 -B through an alternative c ompliance payment mechanism in 4 
accordance with this subsection.  5 
A.  The commission shall set the alternative compliance payment rate by rule and 6 
shall publish the alternative compliance payment rate by January 31st of each year. In 7 
setting the rate, the co mmission shall take into account prevailing market prices, 8 
standard -offer service prices for electricity, reliance on alternative compliance 9 
payments to meet the requirements of subsection 3 -A and investment in new 10 
renewable capacity resources in the State  during the previous calendar year.  11

paragraph in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund e stablished under 14 
section 10121, subsection 2 to be used to fund research, development and 15 
demonstration projects relating to renewable energy technologies and to fund rebates 16 
for cost -effective renewable energy technologies.  17 
C.  Beginning October 1, 2015, the commission shall set the alternative compliance 18 
payment rate for solar energy at $200 per solar renewable energy credit.  Beginning 19 
January 1, 2023, the commission shall set the alternative compliance payment rate for 20 
solar energy by rule in order to m eet the requirements of subsection 3 -B and maintain 21 
the rate of solar market development over the previous 5 years.  22 
The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted under this 23 
subsection are routine technical rules as defined in  Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 24 
Sec. 9.  35-A MRSA §3210 -C, sub -§3-A is enacted to read:  25 
3-A.  Solar market stabilization contracts.  Beginning October 1, 2015 and on 26 
January 1st every year thereafter through the year ending December 31, 2022, the 27 
commission shall conduct an auction or an alternative competitive solicitation for long - 28 
term contracts for solar renewable energy credits in accordance with this subsection.  29 
Each year the commission shall solicit contracts for no more than 40% and no less than 30 
20% of the total solar renewable energy credits that will be required during that year in 31 
accordance with section 3210, subsection 3 -B.  The commission shall solicit contracts for 32 
solar renewable energy credits at a fixed price in relation to the year 's alternative 33 
compliance payment rate for solar energy under subsection 9, paragraph C as follows:  34 
A.  In 2015 and 2016, the price must be 80% of the alternative compliance payment 35 
rate for solar energy;  36 
B.  In 2017, the price must be 75% of the alternati ve compliance payment rate for 37 
solar energy;  38 
C.  In 2018, the price must be 70% of the alternative compliance payment rate for 39 
solar energy;  40 
D.  In 2019, the price must be 65% of the alternative compliance payment rate for 41 
solar energy;  42 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1010(01) -1 
 E.  In 2020, the pr ice must be 60% of the alternative compliance payment rate for 1 
solar energy;  2 
F.  In 2021, the price must be 55% of the alternative compliance payment rate for 3 
solar energy; and  4 
G.  In 2022, the price must be 50% of the alternative compliance payment rate f or 5 
solar energy.  6 
The term of all contracts must be between 10 and 20 years.  The commission may also 7 
offer solicitations for contracts for future years using the alternative compliance payment 8 
rate for solar energy reasonably anticipated for those years, a s long as the total volume of 9 
solar renewable energy credits does not exceed the limits in this subsection.  10 
The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.  Rules adopted under this 11 
subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 12 
SUMMARY  13 
This bill allows customers of transmission and distribution utilities to engage in net 14 
energy billing, a method under which a customer is billed on the basis of net energy over 15 
the billing period taking into account accumulated unused kilowatt -hour credits from the 16 
previous billing period.  It changes the law regarding renewable resources to increase the 17 
new renewable capacity resources percentages in the portfolio requirements of 18 
competitive electricity providers and  requires those increases to be met by new renewable 19 
capacity resources that rely on solar energy; and it removes the Public Utilities 20 
Commission's power to suspend scheduled increases in portfolio requirements for new 21 
renewable capacity resources.  It als o establishes an alternative compliance payment 22 
mechanism and a system of solar renewable energy credits, including an auction for long - 23 
term contracts for these credits, in order to provide competitive electricity providers with 24 
alternative methods to sati sfy the new portfolio requirements.  25
