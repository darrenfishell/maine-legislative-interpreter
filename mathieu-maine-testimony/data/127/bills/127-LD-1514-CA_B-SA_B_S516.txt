Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note G-5'l~ 
Potential future biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Potential future biennium cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
While the bill requires MaineCare reimburse for advancded dental therapist services, any increase in MaineCare costs 
would not likely occur until the following biennium. The fiscal impact on MaineCare will ultimately depend on the 
timing and number of advanced dental therapists licensed in Maine, the type and volume of services provided and the 
extent to which these services replace existing dental services provided. 
The Board of Dental Examiners, affiliated with the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, may incur 
additional costs to implement the process of creating a new category of dental hygienist authority, the advanced dental 
therapists. However, these costs are not expected to be incurred until future biennia as it is anticipated that it will take 
several years before potential candidates become qualified.
