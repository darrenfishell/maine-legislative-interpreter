SUMMARY  4 
This bill requires public disclosure of political contributions of $250,000 or more 5 
during a biennial election cycle by persons to a state -based political action committee, 6 
party committee, ballot question committee or candidate.  It requires the Commission on 7 
Governmental Ethics a nd Election Practices to provide a voluntary pledge form to 8 
political action committees on which they may pledge not to spend money in a Maine 9 
Clean Election Act candidate's race and also to post on its publicly accessible website the 10 
names of political ac tion committees and the names of an officer of each political action 11 
committee and each political action committee's top donor.  It amends the law governing 12 
political communications to require disclosure of the 2 highest contributors to a person 13 
purchasing  a political communication if any such contributor has contributed within the 14 
past year at least $10,000 to the person. It requires that a communication by direct mail of 15 
200 pieces or more must contain, in addition to the authorization and name and addres s 16 
required under current law, the names of individuals or businesses that have made 17 
aggregate donations of $200,000 or more within the past year to the person making the 18 
communication.  It requires a political action committee that transfers over $25,000 i n the 19 
aggregate during a biennial election cycle to another political action committee to pay a 20 
fee of 1/4 of that aggregate amount to the Maine Clean Election Fund.  It also requires a 21 
labor union to send a letter to each of its members within 3 weeks of an election for 22 
Governor, State Senator or State Representative stating which state -based political action 23 
committees, party committees, ballot question committees and candidates the labor union 24 
contributed to during the previous biennial election cycle an d the total amount of money 25 
contributed to each entity and candidate and allows a member to bring suit when a labor 26 
union fails to do so.  27
