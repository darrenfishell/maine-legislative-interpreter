SUMMARY  18 
Part A makes the following changes to the State's tax laws.  19 
1.  It requires qualified community development entities to notify the Department of 20 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue Services when a qu alified 21 
equity investment has been transferred.  A transfer of the qualified equity investment 22 
affects who is eligible to claim a tax credit under the Maine New Markets Capital 23 
Investment Program in the year of the transfer and in any subsequent year.  24 
2.  It requires the Finance Authority of Maine to provide the Bureau of Revenue 25 
Services with copies of the annual reports currently required of qualified community 26 
development entities under the Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program.  27 
3.  Currently the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife does not collect sales or 28 
use tax upon the registration of a snowmobile or all -terrain vehicle by a person who is not 29 
a resident of Maine.  This bill repeals that provision of the law.  30 
4.  It repeals a provision allowing for the disclosure of benefit information under the 31 
Circuitbreaker Program to a representative of a municipality that has adopted a municipal 32 
property tax assistance program since no benefits are allowed under the Circuitbreaker 33 
Program for claims  filed on or after August 1, 2013.  34 
5.  It authorizes disclosure to a Pine Tree Development Zone business of otherwise 35 
confidential tax information of a contractor or subcontractor that had assigned its claim to 36 
the business for sales or use tax reimburseme nt. 37 
 
 Page 15 - 127LR0480(01) -1 
 6.  It clarifies that the State Tax Assessor may require unemployment compensation 1 
returns to be filed electronically.  The Bureau of Revenue Services processes these 2 
returns and associated payments for the Department of Labor.  3 
7.  It repeals an obsole te reference to the Circuitbreaker Program in the property tax 4 
abatement law.  5 
8.  It strikes an erroneous reference in the property tax abatement law to a provision 6 
that mandates that the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and 7 
other st ate officers, must provide the State Tax Assessor with information necessary for 8 
the valuing of land in the unorganized territory; the mandate has no relationship to the 9 
abatement of Maine property taxes.  10 
9.  It repeals definitions of 2 terms that are no l onger used in the sales tax law: "forest 11 
land" and "forest products."  12 
10.  It clarifies the definition of "manufacturing facility" in the sales tax law.  13 
11.  It consolidates and simplifies the list of exclusions from the definition of "sale 14 
price" under th e sales tax law by repealing references to 4 separate fees imposed by the 15 
State and enacting a general exclusion for any charge or fee imposed by state law.  16 
12.  It simplifies the sales tax exemption for coal, oil and wood.  17 
13.  It updates language with re spect to the sales tax exemption for residential child 18 
care facilities so that it is consistent with the terminology employed by the Department of 19 
Health and Human Services.  20 
14.  It clarifies that the "immediate removal" sales tax exemption with respect to  21 
certain vehicles purchased or leased by nonresidents does not apply to any motor vehicle 22 
that is being leased on a short -term basis.  Under current law, the exemption does not 23 
apply to an automobile that is being leased on a short -term basis.  24 
15.  It clar ifies that the "immediate removal" sales tax exemption does not apply to a 25 
camper trailer or truck camper that is being leased on a short -term basis.  26 
16.  It clarifies existing language with respect to the partial sales tax exemption for 27 
certain watercraft  purchased in Maine.  28 
17.  It updates language with respect to the sales tax exemption for child care 29 
facilities so that it is consistent with the terminology employed by the Department of 30 
Health and Human Services.  31 
18.  It updates the sales tax exemption f or church -affiliated residential homes to 32 
delete obsolete language regarding charters granted by the Legislature.  33 
19.  It updates the sales tax exemption for food assistance purchases to include 34 
supplemental nutrition assistance program purchases and to de lete an obsolete reference 35 
to food stamps.  36 
 
 Page 16 - 127LR0480(01) -1 
 20.  It deletes obsolete language regarding the effective date of the sales tax 1 
exemption for tree seedlings used in commercial forestry.  2 
21.  It amends the sales tax imposed on certain casual sales to clarify tha t the tax does 3 
not apply to a sale made to a trust when the seller is the owner of 50% or more of the 4 
ownership interests in the trust.  This change extends to trusts the same treatment 5 
extended to corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies an d limited liability 6 
partnerships under current law.  7 
22.  It clarifies the method of calculating the sales tax on the rental or lease of an 8 
automobile for one year or more.  9 
23.  It removes gender -specific language.  10 
24.  It makes a minor change to more equit ably expand the sales tax refund provision 11 
for certain items withdrawn from inventory for use in another jurisdiction.  12 
25.  It repeals an obsolete sales tax refund provision that was in effect only for certain 13 
purchases made from April 1, 2008 to September  30, 2008.  14 
26.  It clarifies that required quarterly insurance premiums tax payments are 15 
estimated payments and not payments made based on quarterly returns.  An annual return 16 
is required to report the tax liability, and to reconcile estimated tax payments  made, for 17 
the year.  18 
27.  It replaces the term "personal home care" in the service provider tax law with the 19 
term "personal care home" to mirror the term used in the rules of the Department of 20 
Health and Human Services.  21 
28.  It repeals the law governing th e sourcing of mobile telecommunications services.  22 
Mobile telecommunications services are now sourced for state taxation purposes to the 23 
state of primary use, in conformity with the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing 24 
Act, Public Law 106 -252. 25 
29.  I t amends the application of revenues provision in the service provider tax in 26 
order to add a reference to specify that the tax is imposed on group residential services for 27 
persons with brain injuries.  28 
30.  It clarifies that a cigarette distributor's licens e, like all other licenses and 29 
certificates issued by the State Tax Assessor, is not a license within the meaning of that 30 
term in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  31 
31.  It clarifies that a tobacco products distributor's license, like all other licens es and 32 
certificates issued by the State Tax Assessor, is not a license within the meaning of that 33 
term in the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.  34 
32.  It clarifies that the Maine net income of a unitary business is determined in the 35 
same way that it is for  a taxable corporation that is not a member of a unitary business.  36 
Maine net income in both cases is calculated on the basis of federal taxable income 37 
apportionable to Maine modified by the addition and subtraction modifications provided 38 
 
 Page 17 - 127LR0480(01) -1 
 by Title 36, sect ion 5200 -A.  The clarification is a technical change and consistent with 1 
long-standing administrative procedures and practice.  2 
33.  It updates references in the statutory provision governing the subtraction 3 
modification that allows an individual who is an owner of an electing S corporation to 4 
recapture the bonus depreciation add -backs made by the business in prior years when it 5 
was treated as a C corporation for federal and Maine income tax purposes.  This change 6 
reflects long -standing statutory and adminis trative practice.  7 
34.  It updates references to the statutory provisions governing the pension deduction 8 
in order to reflect recent law changes.  9 
35.  It clarifies that returns claiming a refundable seed capital credit must be filed the 10 
calendar year follo wing the calendar year during which the investment was made.  11 
Part B requires the State Tax Assessor to obtain national criminal history record 12 
information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for any person who provides or is 13 
assigned to provide servic es to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 14 
Bureau of Revenue Services under a contract or subcontract that the assessor determines 15 
involves access or a substantial possibility of access to the bureau's information 16 
technology systems or to confidential taxpayer information.  An individual who is 17 
assigned to provide services to the bureau pursuant to such a contract must consent to 18 
having fingerprints taken for purposes of a background check before the individual may 19 
provide such services.  20 
This Part also brings applicants for employment with the bureau's Office of Tax 21 
Policy within the existing background check process required under the Maine Revised 22 
Statutes, Title 36, section 194 -B. 23
