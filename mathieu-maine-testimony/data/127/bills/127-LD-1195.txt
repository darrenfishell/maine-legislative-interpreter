§359.  Audits; penalty; monitoring  15 
1.  Audits.   The board shall audit claims, including insurer, self -insurer, Maine 16

basis to determine whether insurers, self -insured employers, the Maine Insurance 18 
Guaranty Association  and 3rd -party administrators have met their obligations under this 19 
Act and to identify the disputes that arose, the reasons for the disputes, the method and 20 
manner  of their resolution, the costs incurred, the reasons for attorney involvement and 21 
the services rendered by the attorneys.  Any de minimis error in the calculation of average 22 
weekly wage may not be considered in the calculation of any penalty under this se ction.  23 
If as a result of an examination and after providing the opportunity for a hearing the board 24 
determines that any compensation, interest, penalty or other obligation is due and unpaid 25 
to an employee, dependent, service provider or any other entity, t he board shall issue a 26 
notice of assessment detailing the amounts due and unpaid in each case and shall order 27

After an audit and examination, if the board determines that an assessment in the 29 
aggregate could  equal or exceed the amount of compensation, interest, penalty or other 30 
obligations identified in audit, a hearing must be held before a 3 -member panel composed 31 
of the executive director, a hearing officer appointed by the board and the Superintendent 32 
of Insurance or the superintendent's designee.  The superintendent or the superintendent's 33 
designee shall serve as the chair of the panel.  The panel shall render its decision by 34 
majority vote and advise the board of its decision.  The board shall then issue a  notice of 35 
assessment accordingly.  36 
2.  Penalty.   In addition to any other penalty assessment permitted under this Act, the 37 
board  Superintendent of Insurance  may assess civil penalties not to exceed $25,000 upon 38 
finding, after hearing, that an employer, ins urer or 3rd -party administrator for an 39 
employer has engaged in a pattern of questionable claims -handling techniques or repeated 40 
unreasonably contested claims.  The board shall certify its findings to the  The 41 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1748(01) -1 
 Superintendent of Insurance , who  shall take appr opriate action so as to bring any such 1 
practices to a halt.  This certification by the board is exempt from the provisions of the 2 
Maine Administrative Procedure Act.   The amount of any penalty assessed pursuant to 3 
this subsection must be directly related t o the severity of the pattern of questionable 4 
claims -handling techniques or repeated unreasonably contested claims.  All penalties 5 
collected pursuant to this subsection must be deposited in the General Fund.  An 6 
insurance carrier's payment of any penalty a ssessed under this section may not be 7 
considered an element of loss for the purpose of establishing rates for workers' 8 
compensation insurance.  9 
3.  Monitoring.   No later than July 1, 1993 the board shall implement a monitoring 10 
program to evaluate and compar e the cost, utilization and performance of the workers' 11 
compensation system for each calendar year beginning with 1988.  The information 12

employment levels, the type and cost of the benefits provided, attorney involvement and 14 
litigation levels, and the long -term, postinjury economic status of injured workers, as well 15

of this Act, inc luding rulemaking and recommending legislation.  The board shall report 17 
the results of its monitoring program to the joint standing committee having jurisdiction 18 
over workers' compensation matters on an annual basis by March 1st of each year.  19 
Sec. 16.  Tas k force.  The Workers' Compensation Board, established in the Maine 20

industrial injury or to conduct an audit must submit a report of the investigation or audit 11 
to the Superintendent of Insurance as well as to the board.  12 
5.  It eliminates authorization for the board to audit the Maine Insurance Guaranty 13 
Association.  14 
6.  It authorizes the disclosure of audit working papers to the Superintende nt of 15 
Insurance.  16 
7.  It provides that an employee who has received a personal injury arising out of and 17

8.  It specifies that for a first failure to pay benefits, the penalty for delay of $50 per 21 
day may not be more than $500, and that for a second failure to pay, the pen alty for delay 22 
of $50 per day may not be more than $1,000.  23 
9.  It eliminates language identifying the Maine Insurance Guaranty Association as an 24 
employer or insurance carrier for purposes of assessing penalties for delay in payment.  25 
10.  It specifies that wage statements must report wages of the employee in the same 26 
manner as wages are paid.  27

assignment must be made within 30 days of the request.  29 
12.  It requires that the independent medical examiner submit a written report of 30

sum settlements applies to injuries occurring after January 1, 2015; that the computation 5

be assessed for the amount of any settlement intended to pay for current or future medical 7 
costs.  8
