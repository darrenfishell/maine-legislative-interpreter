The amendment removes the requirement that the Department ofInland Fisheries and Wildlife (IF&W) issue 33 
moose and 33 bear permits to disabled veterans without a fee. This amendment allows the IF&W commissioner to 
reduce the 33 moose permits allocated to both the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Aroostook Band of 
Micmacs if biological data and sound management practices warrant it. The amendment will reduce the General Fund 
revenue loss by an estimated $3,015 and reduce the Other Special Revenue Funds revenue loss to the Moose Research 
and Management Fund within IF&W by an estimated $300 in fiscal year 2015-16 and in every subsequent fiscal year. 
These numbers assume that the IF & W commissioner will not limit the number of allocated moose permits to these 
groups.
