ยง15683 -B.  Public charter schools; calculation of total allocation and state 33 
contribution  34 
Beginning with fiscal year 2015 -16, this section applies to public charter schools 35 
authorized by the Maine Charter School Commission, established under Title 5, sect ion 36 
12004 -G, subsection 10 -D, in accordance with the funding provisions established in 37 
section 2413 -A. 38 
1.  Calculation of EPS per -pupil rates.   If there is only one school administrative 39 
unit sending students to a public charter school in a school year, t he commissioner shall 40 
use that resident school administrative unit's EPS per -pupil rate.  If there is more than one 41 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR1862(01) -1 
 school administrative unit sending students to the public charter school, the commissioner 1 
shall calculate a public charter school's EPS per -pupil rate for each year as follows.  2 
A.  When there are elementary students from outside of a single resident school 3 
administrative unit sending students to an elementary public charter school, the EPS 4 
per-pupil rate for elementary grades is calculated by  multiplying the number of 5 
students from a resident school administrative unit attending the public charter school 6 
by that resident school administrative unit's elementary EPS per -pupil rate to find the 7 
total cost for elementary students enrolled in the pu blic charter school in that resident 8 
school administrative unit, then adding the total cost for elementary students enrolled 9 
in the public charter school from each resident school administrative unit.  The result 10 
is divided by the total number of elementar y students in the public charter school.  11 
B.  When there are secondary students from outside of a single resident school 12 
administrative unit sending students to a public charter school, the EPS per -pupil rate 13 
for secondary grades is calculated by multiplyin g the number of students from a 14 
resident school administrative unit attending the public charter school by that resident 15 
school administrative unit's secondary EPS per -pupil rate to find the total cost for 16 
secondary students enrolled in the public charter school in that resident school 17 
administrative unit, then adding the total cost for secondary students enrolled in the 18 
public charter school from each resident school administrative unit.  The result is 19 
divided by the total number of secondary students in t he public charter school.  20 
2.  Pupil counts.  Notwithstanding section 15674, the commissioner shall determine 21 
a public charter school's student counts for each year as follows.  22 
A.  The basic student count for a public charter school is the pupil count for O ctober 23 
1st of the most recent calendar year prior to the year of funding.  24 
B.  The number of economically disadvantaged students for each public charter 25 
school is determined by multiplying the number of pupils by the most recent 26 
available elementary free or  reduced -price meals percentage for that public charter 27 
school.  The elementary free or reduced -price meals percentage may be applied to 28 
determine the number of economically disadvantaged students in the public charter 29 
school secondary grades.  If the publ ic charter school does not operate elementary 30 
grades, the most recent available secondary free or reduced -price meals percentage 31 
must be used in place of the elementary free or reduced -price meals percentage.  32 
C.  The number of limited English proficiency s tudents for each public charter school 33 
is the number of limited English proficiency students in the most recent October pupil 34 
count prior to the year of funding.  35 
D.  The number of special education students for each public charter school is the 36 
number of s pecial education students in the most recent October pupil count prior to 37 
the year of funding.  38 
3.  Operating allocation.  The commissioner shall determine a public charter 39 
school's operating allocation for each year as the sum of:  40 
A.  The base allocation, which is the pupil count pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph 41 
A multiplied by the public charter school's EPS per -pupil rates calculated pursuant to 42 
subsection 1;  43 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1862(01) -1 
 B.  The economically disadvantaged student allocation, which is the pupil count 1 
determined pur suant to subsection 2, paragraph B multiplied by the additional weight 2 
for each economically disadvantaged student pursuant to section 15675, subsection 2;  3 
C.  The limited English proficiency student allocation, which is the pupil count 4 
pursuant to subsect ion 2, paragraph C multiplied by the additional weight for each 5 
limited English proficiency student pursuant to section 15675, subsection 1;  6 
D.  The targeted funds for standards -based system allocation, which is based on the 7 
per-pupil amount pursuant to se ction 15683, subsection 1, paragraph C multiplied by 8 
the pupil count pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph A;  9 
E.  The targeted funds for technology resource allocation, which is based on the per - 10 
pupil amount pursuant to section 15683, subsection 1, paragraph  D multiplied by the 11 
pupil count in subsection 2, paragraph A; and  12 
F.  The targeted funds for public preschool to grade 2 student allocation, which is 13 
based on the preschool to grade 2 pupil count pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph A 14 
multiplied by the pub lic charter school's elementary EPS per -pupil rates in subsection 15 
1. 16 
4.  Other subsidizable costs allocation.  The commissioner shall determine a public 17 
charter school's other subsidizable costs allocation for each year as the sum of:  18

paragraph A, subparagraph (4);  20 
B.  The special education allocation pursuant to section 2413 -A, subsection 2, 21 
paragraph B.  The special education allocation may not be less than 90% of the public 22 
charter school base year expenditures for special education; and  23 
C.  The transportation operating allocation, which is the statewide per -pupil essential 24 
programs and services transportation operating allocation multiplied by a percentage 25 
established by the  Maine Charter School Commission for that public charter school 26 
based on the cost of transportation services provided by the public charter school to 27 
the student but not to exceed 100% multiplied by the pupil count in subsection 2, 28 
paragraph A.  29 
A public ch arter school is not entitled to career and technical education funding.  The 30 
school administrative unit in which the public charter school student resides must pay the 31 
cost of attendance for a student at a career and technical education program.  32 
5.  Total allocation and state contribution.  The commissioner shall determine a 33 
public charter school's total allocation as the sum of the school's operating allocation 34 
under subsection 3 and other subsidizable costs allocation under subsection 4.  That total 35 
alloc ation is the state contribution, except that up to 3% of this amount must be withheld 36 
in accordance with section 2405, subsection 5, paragraph B and transferred to the Maine 37 
Charter School Commission account.  38

state subs idy and pay on behalf of the public charter school allowable school -based costs 2 
that represent the public charter school's portion of MaineCare payments.  A transfer of 3 
payment by the department to the Department of Health and Human Services must be 4 
made p ursuant to a schedule agreed upon by the Department of Health and Human 5 
Services and the department and based on documentation of payments made from 6 
MaineCare funds.  7 
8.  Curtailment adjustment.  In any funding year, if general purpose aid for local 8 
school funding is curtailed, then the public charter school state contribution under this 9 
chapter must be curtailed by the proportional percentage that school administrative units 10 
have been curtailed.  11 
9.  Phase -in procedures for new or newly expanded public chart er schools.  For 12 
new or newly expanded public charter schools, the commissioner shall make a 13 
preliminary calculation of total allocation based on the following:  14 
A.  Estimated student counts not to exceed the enrollment limit established by the 15 
Maine Charte r School Commission;  16 
B.  Estimated rates and weights based on statewide averages; and  17
