workers or a job classification as sociated with the employer is that of an employee or an 9 
independent contractor.  10 
A.  The predetermination by the board  Bureau of Insurance  creates a rebuttable 11 
presumption that the determination is correct in any later claim for benefits under this 12 
Act proceeding under Title 24 -A. 13 
B.  Nothing in this subsection requires a worker, an employer or a workers' 14 
compensation insurance carrier to request predetermination.  15 
1-A.  Predetermination permitted for construction subcontractors.  A person, as 16

105-A, subsec tion 1, paragraph D.  20 
A.  The predetermination issued by the board  Bureau of Insurance  pursuant to this 21

status of the wood harvester is that of a n independent contractor.  31 
A.  A predetermination under this subsection related only to a person engaged in 32 
harvesting forest products is a conclusive presumption that the determination is 33 
correct.  34

 2.  Premium adjustment.  If it is determined that a predetermination does not 1 
withstand board or judicial  scrutiny when raised in a subsequent workers' compensation 2 
claim  procee ding under Title 24 -A, then, depending on the final outcome of that 3 
subsequent proceeding, either the workers' compensation insurance carrier shall return 4 
excess premium collected or the employer shall remit premium subsequently due in order 5 
to put the par ties in the same position as if the final outcome under the contested claim  6 
proceeding  were predetermined correctly.  7

Sec. 6.  39-A MRSA §40 1, sub -§2, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and 26 
affected by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:  27

403. 31 
Sec. 7.  39-A MRSA §401, sub -§3, as amended by PL 1999, c. 364, §5, is further 32 
amended to read:  33 
3.  Failure to conform.  The failure of any private  employer or of any person 34 
engaged in harvesting forest products not exempt under subsection 1 or of any 35 
governmental body, as defined in subsection 2, to procure insurance coverage for  secure  36 
the payment of compensation pursuant to sections 402 to 407  with respect to all 37

For purposes of this subsection, the term "insurance coverage" includes authorization by 42 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR2581(01) -1 
 the Superintendent of Insurance to self -insure.  An emplo yer that purchases a workers' 1 
compensation policy or self -insures as set forth in section 403 and misclassifies one or 2 
more employees as independent contractors has not complied with the coverage 3 
provisions of this Act and is subject to all applicable pena lties for failure to secure 4 
payment of compensation with respect to all misclassified employees.  5 
Sec. 8.  39-A MRSA §401, sub -§4, as amended by PL 2011, c. 643, §12 and 6 
affected by §14, is further amended to read:  7 
4.  Liability of landowner.  A landowner s ubject to this Act who contracts to have 8 
wood harvested from the landowner's property by a contractor who, as an employer, is 9 
subject to this Act and who has not complied with the provisions of this section and who 10 
does not comply with the provisions of th is section prior to the date of an injury or death 11 
for which a claim is made is liable to pay to any person employed by the contractor in the 12 
execution of the work any compensation under this Act that the landowner would have 13 
been liable to pay if that per son had been immediately employed by the landowner.  14 
A landowner is not liable for compensation if at the time the landowner enters into the 15 
contract with the contractor, the landowner applies for and receives a predetermination of 16 
the independent status of  the contractor as set forth in section 105 , subsection 1 -B, the 17 
landowner requests and receives a certificate of independent status, issued by the board  18 
Bureau of Insurance  on an annual basis to a contractor, certifying that the contractor 19 
harvests forest  products in a manner that would not make the contractor an employee of 20 
the landowner or the landowner requests and receives a certificate of insurance, issued by 21 
the contractor's insurance carrier, certifying that the contractor has obtained the required 22 
coverage and indicating the effective dates of the policy, and if the landowner requests 23 
and receives at least annually similar certificates indicating continuing coverage during 24 
the performance of the work.  A landowner who receives a predetermination of the 25 
contractor's status as independent contractor or a certificate of independent status is only 26 
relieved of liability under this paragraph if the contract for wood harvesting expressly 27 
states that the independent contractor will not hire any employees to assist in the wood 28 
harvesting without first providing the required certificate of insurance to the landowner.  29 
Notwithstanding section 105, subsection 1, paragraph A, a predetermination under 30 
section 105 related only to a person engaged in harvesting forest  products is a conclusive 31 
presumption that the determination is correct and section 105, subsection 2 does not apply 32 
to that determination.  Each party involved in or affected by the predetermination must be 33 
provided information on the workers' compensatio n laws and the effect of independent 34 
contractor status in relation to those laws.  A predetermination under section 105 related 35 
to a person engaged in harvesting forest products is effective for one calendar year or the 36 
duration of the contract, whichever is shorter.  37 
A landowner required to pay compensation under this section is entitled to be 38 
indemnified by the contractor and may recover the amount paid in an action against that 39 
contractor.  A landowner may demand that the contractor enter into a written a greement 40 
to reimburse the landowner for any loss incurred under this section due to a claim filed 41 
for compensation and other benefits.  The employee is not entitled to recover at common 42 
law against the landowner for any damages arising from such injury if the employee takes 43 
compensation from that landowner.  44 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR2581(01) -1 
 Landowners willfully acting to circumvent the provisions of this section by using 1 
coercion, intimidation, deceit or other means to encourage persons who would otherwise 2 
be considered employees within the  meaning of this Act to pose as contractors for the 3 
purpose of evading this section are liable subject to the provisions of section 324, 4 
subsection 3.  Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit an employee from 5 
becoming a contractor subject to t he provisions of section 102, subsection 13 -A. 6 
Sec. 9.  39-A MRSA §407, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 885, Pt. A, §8 and affected 7 
by §§9 to 11, is amended to read:  8 
§407.  Preservation of existing employer status  9 
An employer with a currently approved workers' c ompensation policy or a currently 10 
accepted self -insurance workers' compensation  policy under sections 401 to 407 is 11 
deemed to be in compliance with this Act until the expiration or cancellation date of the 12 
current assent based on the policy or plan  that ha s misclassified one or more employees 13 
has intentionally failed to secure payment of compensation within the meaning of section 14 
324, subsection 3 and is subject to the penalties prescribed by that section .  15 
Notwithstanding this section, all workers' compens ation policies and self -insured 16 
workers' compensation policies must include a provision requiring payment of benefits 17 
under this Act to an employee even if the employee was misclassified on the date of 18 
injury or death.  19 
SUMMARY  20 
This bill makes the following  changes to the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 21 
1992.  22 
1.  It transfers the predetermination of independent contractor status process to the 23 
Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance.  24 
2.  It establishes that rebuttable pres umptions granted as a result of a request for a 25 
predetermination are admissible only in proceedings arising under the Maine Revised 26 
Statutes, Title 24 -A.  Conclusive predeterminations received by landowners continue to 27 
be admissible in proceedings under th e Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992.  28 
3.  It modifies the law after the Law Court's decision in Workers' Compensation 29 
Board Abuse Investigation Unit v. Nate Holyoke Builders, Inc., et al. , 2015 ME 99 and 30 
ensures employers that misclassify employees as  independent contractors are subject to 31 
penalties under the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 1992.  32 
4.  It increases the Workers' Compensation Board's assessment cap starting in fiscal 33 
year 2016 -17. 34 
5.  It establishes that appeals to the Law Court from th e Workers' Compensation 35 
Board are from decisions of the Workers' Compensation Board's Appellate Division and 36 
not an individual administrative law judge.  37
