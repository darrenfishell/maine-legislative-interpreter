Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to maintain an agricultural jobs 
network linking farms and facilities processing agricultural products grown in the State with available workers. This 
bill requires ACF to conduct an educational marketing campaign to promote food self-sufficiency and engage in the 
use of social media, radio advertising, posters, brochures and publicly accessible department websites. The bill 
includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $25,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 to conduct a statewide radio 
campaign, create posters and brochures and provide funds for website costs and General Fund appropriations of 
$17,140 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $22,960 in fiscal year 2016-17 for one part-time Planning and Research Assistant

Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services, the University of Maine COQperative 
Extension, the Maine Community College System, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education and the 
Department of Economic and Community Development to implement the requirements of this bill are expected to be 
minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
