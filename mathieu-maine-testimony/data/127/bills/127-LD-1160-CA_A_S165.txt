18 SUMMARY 
19 This amendment replaces the bill. Current law provides that a person who with the 
20 intent to defraud and to prevent detection alters or removes the manufacturer's make, 
21 model or serial number from a firearm commits the Class E crime of criminal simulation. 
22 To be guilty of that crime, the person must have committed the act with the intent to 
23 defraud and to prevent identification. This amendment changes the law to require either 
24 the intent to defraud or the intent to prevent identification, but not both, as elements of the 
25 crime. It also makes this crime a Class C crime as is provided for in the bill. 
26 This amendment also provides that a person who possesses an altered firearm with 
27 the intent to defraud or to prevent identification or intentionally or knowingly transports 
28 such a firearm with the intent to defraud or to prevent identification commits the crime of 
29 criminal simulation.
