Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This legislation requires the Department of EUUl:ation to collect anu aggregate data regarding the issuance of 
certificates of content area proficiency. The Department of Education has indicated that the funding to support the 
data collection costs associated with this requirement is included in LD 1019, the Governor's proposed 2016-2017 
biennial budget. Therefore, no General Fund appropriations are needed. If, however, the funding for the department's 
data collection efforts is not included as part of the final actions of the Legislature on the 2016-2017 biennial budget, 
this fiscal note may need to be adjusted.
