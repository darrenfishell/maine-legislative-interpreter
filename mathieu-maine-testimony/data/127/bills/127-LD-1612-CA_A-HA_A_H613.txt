Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management to include marketing and 
outreach objectives as a core · function of the bureau. The marketing and outreach 
objectives are intended to identify residents in the State who are veterans and also to

Under current law, the Liquor Operation Revenue Fund (Liquor Fund) within the Maine Municipal Bond Bank is 
required to distribute funds in the following order in fiscal year 2016-17: ( 1) Liquor Operation Revenue Bonds debt 
service, which will be $26,841,273 in fiscal year 2016-17; (2) $9,817,000 to the General Fund (GF); (3) up to 
$3,500,000 to each of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS), and; (4) remaining amounts to the Department of Transportation (DOT). This amendment raises the 
maximum transfer by an additional $628, 720 in fiscal year 2016-17 and has the following new order of distributions: 
(1) same payment of debt service; (2) $9,897,546 to the GF; (3) $548,174 to the Bureau of Veterans Services Special 
Operations Fund; (4) up to $3,500,000 to each of the DEP and the DHHS, and; (5) remaining amounts to the DOT. 
Under current law, the Liquor Fund is required to distribute funds in the following order in fiscal years 2017-18 
through 2023-24: (1) payment of debt service; (2) up to $3,500,000 each to the DEP and the DHHS, and; (3) 
remainder to the DOT. The new distribution would raise the maximum transfer by an additional $548, 17 4 and has the 
following new order of distributions: (1) same payment of debt service; (2) up to $3,500,000 each to the DEP and the 
DHHS; (3) $548,174 to the Bureau of Veterans Services Operations Fund, and; (4) the remainder to the DOT. 
LR2675(04) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
Under current law, the Liquor Fund, after all debt service and any ancillary obligations secured by the fund have been 
retired, proceeds are distributed as follows: (1) up to a total of 15% of funds to the DEP and the DHHS; (2) 35% to

follows: (1) up to a total of15% to the DEP and the DHHS; (2) $548,174 to the Bureau ofVeterans Services Special 
Operations Fund; (3) 35% of the remaining funds to the DOT, and; (4) 65% of the remainder to the Maine Budget 
Stabilization Fund. 
The Liquor Fund is expected to receive sufficient revenue from liquor operations to make these transfers to the 
various entities. This amendment contains the necessary OSRF allocations to sufficiently operate the Veterans 
Services Special Operations Fund. 
This bill also provides a sales tax exemption to all federally-chartered veterans' service organizations. This will reduce 
General Fund revenue and Local Government Fund revenue annually beginning in fiscal year 2016-17. The reduction 
to the General Fund will be $80,546 in fiscal year 2016-17, $91,822 in fiscal year 2017-18 and $95,954 in fiscal year 
2018-19. A one-time Liquor Fund revenue transfer will reimburse the General Fund in fiscal year 2016-17 only for the 
$80,546 loss. No Liquor Fund transfers will be made after fiscal year 2016-17 to reimburse the General Fund for the 
loss of sales tax revenue in subsequent years.
