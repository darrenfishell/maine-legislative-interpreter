The required local activities in this bill may represent a State mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. Unless 
General Fund appropriations are provided to fund at least 90% of the additional costs or a Mandate Preamble is 
amended to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt this mandate from the funding 
requirement, municipalities may not be required to implement these changes. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $57,131 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $74,145 in fiscal year 2016-17 
to the Regulation and Enforcement program within the Department of Labor for one Labor/Safety Inspector position 
and related all other costs associated with additional wage determinations, compliance assistance and enforcement 
activities due to extending the prevailing wage requirements. 
LR1479(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
The Department of Transportation, the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and municipalities may 
incur additional costs on construction projects funded through the State's municipal partnership initiative if the total 
project is over $50,000 but the State portion is under $50,000. Since no additional funding is being given to cover 
these potential costs, fewer construction projects could be completed. 
This legislation may increase the total state and local costs of major capital school construction projects and local 
repair projects with a cost of $50,000 or more that are funded by any amount of state funding provided to a school 
dish'ict for that purpose if the prevailing wage is higher than wages and benefits currently being paid by school 
administrative units for construction projects. The impact of this legislation on the State and individual school 
administrative units can not be detennined at this time.
