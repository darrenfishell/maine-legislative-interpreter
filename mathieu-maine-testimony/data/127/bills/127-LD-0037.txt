 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 1 
Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §2054, sub-§2, ¶C, as amended by PL 2013, c. 462, §4, is 2 
further amended to read: 3 
C.  The use of amber lights on vehicles is governed by the following. 4 
(1)  A vehicle engaged in highway maintenance or in emergency rescue 5 
operations by emergency management and public safety agencies and a public 6 
utility emergency service vehicle may be equipped with auxiliary lights that emit 7 
an amber light. 8 
(1-A)  A Department of Labor motor vehicle operated by a workplace safety 9 
inspector may be equipped with auxiliary lights that emit an amber light. 10 
(2)  A wrecker must be equipped with a flashing light mounted on top of the 11 
vehicle in such a manner as to emit an amber light over a 360` 360-degree angle.  12 
The light must be in use on a public way or a place where public traffic may 13 
reasonably be anticipated when servicing, freeing, loading, unloading or towing a 14 
vehicle. 15 
(3)  A vehicle engaged in snow removal or sanding operations on a public wa y 16

intensity to be visible at 500 feet in normal daylight.   When the left wing of a 20 
plow is in operation and extends over the center of the road, an auxiliary light 21 
must show the extreme end of the left wing.  That light may be attached to the 22 
vehicle so that the beam of light points at the left wing.  The light illuminating 23 
the left wing may be controlled by a separate switch or by the regular lighting 24 
system and must be in operation at all times when the vehicle is used for plowing 25 
snow on public ways. 26 
(4)  A vehicle equipped and used for plowing snow on other than public ways 27 
may be equipped with an auxiliary rotary flashing light that must be mounted on 28 
top of the vehicle in such a manner as to emit an amber beam of light over a 360` 29 
360-degree angle, or an amber strobe, or combination of strobes, that emits at a 30 
minimum a beam of 50 candlepower and provides visible light coverage over a 31 
360` 360-degree range.  The light may be in use on a public way only when the 32 
vehicle is entering the public way in the course of plowing private driveways and 33 
other off-highway locations. 34 
(5)  A rural mail vehicle may be equipped with auxiliary lights. 35 
(a)  The lights used to the front must be white or amber, or any shade 36 
between white and amber. 37 
(b)  The lights used to the rear must be amber or red, or any shade between 38 
amber and red. 39 
(c)  The lights, whether used to the front or rear, must be mounted at the 40 
same level and as widely spaced laterally as possible. 41

Sec. 2.  29-A MRSA §2054, sub-§2, ¶F, as amended by PL 2005, c. 299, §1, is 21 
further amended to read: 22 
F.  Only vehicles listed in this paragraph, rural mail vehicles as provided in paragraph 23 
C, subparagraph (5) and school buses may be equipped with, display or use a red 24 
auxiliary or emergency light. 25 
(1)  Emergency lights used on an ambulance, an emergency medical service 26 
vehicle, a fire department vehicle, a fire vehicle, a rescue vehicle or a hazardous 27 
material response vehicle must emit a red light or a combination of red and white 28 
light. 29 
(2)  The municipal officers or a municipal official designated by the municipal 30 
officers, with the approval of the fire chief, may authorize an active member of a 31 
municipal or volunteer fire department to use one red or combination red and 32 
white flashing auxiliary light mounted as near as practicable above the front 33

be used only while the member is en route to or at the scene of a fire or other 39

the windshield must be shielded so that the emitted light does not interfere with 41

 the operator's vision.  The use of lights may be revoked at any time by the fire 1 
chief. 2 
(3)  Members of an emergency medical service licensed by Maine Emergency 3

white combination flashing auxiliary lights and red, amber or combination red 5

the same conditions as those permitted municipal and volunteer firefighters, 7 
when authorized by the chief official of the emergency medical service. The use 8 
of lights may be revoked at any time by the chief official of the emergency 9 
medical service. 10 
SUMMARY 11 
This bill increases the number of emergency lights allowed on personal vehicles used 12 
by firefighters and emergency medical service personnel by increasing the number of 13
