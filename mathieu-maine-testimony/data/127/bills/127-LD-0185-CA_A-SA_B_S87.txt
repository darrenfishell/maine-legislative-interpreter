Fiscal Note 
Minor revenue decrease -General Fund 
Correctional and Judicial Impact Statements 
Lowers penalties from $250 to $75 for fIrst offenses and from $500 to $150 for subsequent offenses. 
The incremental impact of reducing penalties will be a reduction of the minor General Fund revenue increase that 
had been expected from the bill as amended by committee A. Overall as amended here, a small net revenue increase 
is still expected.
