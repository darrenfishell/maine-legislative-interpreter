SUMMARY  5 
This bill creates a new Class II limited lobster and crab fishing license, which 6 
provides the same benefits as a Class II lobster and crab fishing license except that the 7 
holder may fish up to 300 traps instead of the 800 t raps allowed under a Class II license.  8 
The fee for the new Class II limited lobster and crab fishing license is $136 for residents 9 
and $793 for nonresidents, which is less than the fee for a resident or nonresident Class II 10 
license.  11 
Beginning January 1, 2 017, this bill requires that the Commissioner of Marine 12 
Resources adopt rules establishing that the exit ratio in limited -entry lobster and crab 13 
fishing zones be based upon retired licenses only, instead of upon either retired licenses 14 
or retired trap tags . 15 
This bill provides that a participant in the apprentice program under 23 years of age 16 
may receive a Class I, Class II, Class II limited or Class III lobster and crab fishing 17 
license and enter a limited -entry zone if the participant has received a high sc hool 18 
diploma or high school equivalency diploma prior to attaining 23 years of age.  19 
This bill prohibits the adoption of rules that would require a participant in the 20 
apprentice program who has registered to enter an island limited -entry zone program to 21 
apprentice in the zone in which the island limited -entry zone program is located. This bill 22 
also reduces the support required in a referendum of island residents to establish an island 23 
limited -entry zone program from 2/3 of lobster and crab fishing license ho lders to a 24 
majority of license holders.  25 
This bill removes the special licensing fees for applicants who are 70 years of age or 26 
older.  27
