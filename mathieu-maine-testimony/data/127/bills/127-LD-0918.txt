expose and process radiographs indefinitely, u nder the same restrictions as imposed under 25 
the pilot project, except that the authorization applies in the entire State.  This bill 26 
requires the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Board of Dental 27 
Examiners to adopt routine technical rule s by July 30, 2015 for the administration of this 28 
authorization.  Prior to the adoption of rules, the rules that are in effect for the pilot 29

limiting the authorization to dental health professional shortage areas and requiring an 32
