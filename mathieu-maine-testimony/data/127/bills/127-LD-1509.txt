SUMMARY  24 
This bill narrows the requireme nt for political action committees, ballot question 25 
committees and party committees to disclose within 24 hours expenditures greater than 26 
$1,000 made in the last 13 days before an election.  The 24 -hour reporting requirement is 27 
limited to expenditures for communications to voters to influence a ballot measure, 28 
expenditures for polling activities and expenditures in the form of contributions to a 29 
political action committee, party committee, ballot question committee or candidate.  30 
The bill permits organizatio ns making independent expenditures to affirm in writing 31 
or electronically that the expenditure was made independently of candidates in the race 32 
without requiring that the statement be made under oath.  33
