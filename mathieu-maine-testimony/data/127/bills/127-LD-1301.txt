SUMMARY  12 
This bill amends the motor vehicle laws as follows.  13 
1.  It creates a vulnerable user law to protect people on public ways who are not in 14 
motor vehicles.  A "vulnerable user" is defined as a pedestrian, a person performing 15 
emergency work or a person riding or using a nonmotorized device or certain motorized 16 
devices such as a motorcycle, scooter, Segway or electric personal assistive mobility 17 
device.  A motorist who assaults, attempts to assault, taunts or distracts a vulnerable user, 18 
because that person is a vulnerable user, commits a traffic infraction and is subject to the 19 
same penalties as a person who texts while operating a motor vehicle.  20 
2.  It requires a driver education course to contain at least 30 minutes of instruction to 21 
impart the understanding and skills necessary to operate a motor vehicle safely in a 22 
situation in which a vulnerable user is sharing the road with that motor vehicle . 23 
3.  It amends the law regarding pedestrians in crosswalks to require a motor vehicle 24 
to stop and remain stopped when a pedestrian or an extension of a pedestrian is in the 25 
lane, including a bicycle lane, in which the motor vehicle is traveling or a lane adjacent to 26 
that lane.  Nonmotorized traffic is required to yield to such a pedestrian.  27 
4.  It specifies that a person riding a bicycle is required to obey traffic control devices 28 
such as lights, stop signs and yield signs.  29 
5.  It clarifies the law regardi ng travel down one -way streets to allow travel against 30 
the direction indicated when directed by a law enforcement officer or traffic control 31 
device.  32 
6.  It specifies that a person riding a bicycle or scooter or operating on roller skis has 33 
the same rights and duties as a person operating a motor vehicle pursuant to the Maine 34 
Revised Statutes, Title 29 -A, chapter 19, which deals with the operation of a vehicle, 35 
except for laws that expressly apply to bicycles, scooters and roller skis or the law 36 
expressly on ly applies to motor vehicles.  37 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1066(01) -1 
 7.  It expands the provisions of law for which a violation by a person over 17 years of 1 
age riding a bicycle or scooter or operating on roller skis is a traffic infraction.  2 
8.  It specifies that the operator of a motor vehicle  passing a bicyclist or roller skier 3 
proceeding in the same direction must exercise due care by taking into consideration the 4 
speed of the motor vehicle and other conditions and leaving a reasonable and proper 5 
distance between the motor vehicle and the bic ycle or roller skier, but not less than 3 feet, 6 
while the motor vehicle is passing the bicycle or roller skier.  7
