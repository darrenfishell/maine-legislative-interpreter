 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, school resource officers are designated local law enforcement officers 3 
who provide securit y and crime prevention in the school environment; and  4 
Whereas, schools often hold school activities, such as proms, at off -campus 5 
locations where the school resource officer has no law enforcement jurisdiction; and  6 
Whereas, this legislation needs to take e ffect immediately in order to ensure that for 7 
upcoming events in the current school year a school resource officer at an off -campus 8 
event is the same officer who works with that student population on a regular basis; and  9 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Leg islature, these facts create an emergency within 10 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 11 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 12 
therefore,  13 
Be it enacted by the Peopl e of the State of Maine as follows:  14
