low-income community investments that may be made with the proceeds of qualified 
equity investments that have been certified under Title 10, section II OO-Z, subsection 
3, paragraph Gis $10,000,000 per project constrl,lcted, maintained or operated by the 
qualified active low-income community business whether made by one or several

transactions giving rise to the investment and the corresponding tax credits authorized 
under this section are determined by the State Tax Assessor to have achieved a result 
that is inconsistent with the purpose of the Maine New Markets Capital Investment

This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $1 0,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $10,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 
to the Finance Authority of Maine for the additional costs associated with the State Tax Assessor review of sham 
transactions. 
This legislation requires the State Tax Assessor to recapture credits under the Maine New Markets Capital Investment 
Program if the credits are deemed to be the result of sham transactions. It also eliminates the eligibility of certain 
refinancing and ownership transfer transactions that can qualify as investment. These provisions could result in an 
increase in General Fund and Local Government Fund revenue if sham transactions are found. No estimate of the 
potential revenue impact is made at this time. 
It is assumed that the Legislature's Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability would perform any 
additional work required by the bill using existing budgeted resources.
