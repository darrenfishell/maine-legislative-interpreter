127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" 11-" to S.P. 114, L.D. 299, Bill, "An Act To Protect 
Children in Municipal and School Facilities by Requiring Boiler fuspections" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Protect Children in School Facilities by Requiring Boiler Inspections' 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of paragraph E (page 1, lines 4 to 6 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'E. Steam heating boilers, hot water heating boilers and hot water supply boilers 
oonstructed and installed in aooordanoe with the rules adopted by the direotor , with 
the exception of boilers located in schoolhouses; or' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes from the bill the language that subjects boilers owned by 
municipalities to the State's boiler inspection requirem,ents and removes the requirement 
in law that boilers be constructed and installed in accordance with rules adopted by the 
director to be exempt from inspection. 
Although this legislation has been identified as a potential state mandate, the State's 
regulatory oversight of heating boilers and hot water boilers in schools dates back to the 
1930's and represents a long-standing safety requirement to ensure the safe operation of 
boilers in schools, subject only to a brief period of repeal under Public Law 2013, chapter 
595.

The required local activities in this bill may represent a State mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. Unless 
General Fund appropriations are provided to fund at least 90% of the additional costs or a Mandate Preamble is 
amended to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt this mandate from the funding 
requirement, municipalities may not be required to implement these changes. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Reestablishing the requirement that boilers in schools be inspected will increase the amount of dedicated revenue 
received by the Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation (OPOR) within the Department of Professional 
and Financial Regulation by approximately $180,000 per year beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 from certification fees. 
This fiscal note assumes that schools must include an $80 fee when submitting their inspection report to OPOR, which 
was the fee that was in place prior to this requirement being repealed in Public Law 2013, c. 595, Pt. U, ยง 11.
