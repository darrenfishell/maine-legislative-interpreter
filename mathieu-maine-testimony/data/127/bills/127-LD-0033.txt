 2-B.  Top 3 funders; independent expenditures.  A communication that is funded 1 
by an entity making an independent expenditure as defined in section 1019-B, subsection 2 
1 must conspicuously include the following statement: 3 
"The top 3 funders of (name of entity that made the independent expenditure) are (names 4 
of top 3 funders)." 5 
The information required by this subsection may appear simultaneously with any 6 
statement required by subsection 2 or 2-A.  A communication that contains a visual 7 
aspect must include the statement in written text.  A communication that does not contain 8 
a visual aspect must include an audible statement. This statement is required only for 9 
communications made through broadcast or cable television, broadcast radio, Internet 10 
audio programming, direct mail or newspaper or other periodical publications. 11 
A cable television or broadcast television communication must include both an audible 12 
and a written statement. For a cable television or broadcast television communication 30 13 
seconds or less in duration, the audible statement may be modified to include only the 14 
single top funder. 15 
The top funders named in the required statement consist of the funders providing the 16 
highest dollar amount of funding to the entity making the independent expenditure since 17 
the day following the most recent general election day. 18 
A.  For purposes of this subsection, "funder" includes: 19 
(1)  Any entity that has made a contribution as defined in section 1052, 20 
subsection 3 to the entity making the independent expenditure since the day 21 
following the most recent general election day; and 22 
(2)  Any entity that has given a gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of 23 
money or anything of value, including a promise or agreement to provide money 24 
or anything of value whether or not legally enforceable, except for transactions in 25 
which a fair value is given in return, since the day following the most recen t 26 
general election day. 27 
B.  If funders have given equal amounts, creating a tie in the ranking of the top 3 28 
funders, the tie must be broken by naming the tying funders in chronological order of 29 
the receipt of funding until 3 funders are included in the statement.  If the 30 
chronological order cannot be discerned, the entity making the independent 31 
expenditure may choose which of the tying funders to include in the statement.  In no 32 
case may a communication be required to include the names of more than 3 funder s. 33 
C.  The statement required under this subsection is not required to include the name 34 
of any funder who has provided less than $1,000 to the entity making the independent 35 
expenditure since the day following the most recent general election day. 36 
D.  If only one or 2 funders must be included pursuant to this subsection, the 37 
communication must identify the number of funders as "top funder" or "top 2 38 
funders" as appropriate.  If there are no funders required to be included under this 39 
subsection, no statement is required. 40 
E.  When compiling the list of top funders, an entity making an independent 41 
expenditure may disregard any funds that the entity can show were used for purposes 42 
 
 Page 4  - 127LR0409(01)-1 
 unrelated to the candidate mentioned in the communication on the basis that funds 1 
were either spent in the order received or were strictly segregated in other accounts. 2 
F.  In any communication consisting of an audio broadcast of 30 seconds or less or a 3 
print communication of 20 square inches or less, the requirements of this subsection 4 
are satisfied by including the name of the single highest funder only. 5 
G.  If the list of funders changes during the period in which a recurring 6 
communication is aired or published, the statement appearing in the communication 7 
must be updated at the time that any additional payments are made for that 8 
communication. 9 
H.  The commission may establish by routine technical rule, adopted in accordance 10 
with Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A, forms and procedures for ensuring 11 
compliance with this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph must 12 
ensure that the information required by this subsection is effectively conveyed for a 13 
sufficient duration and in a sufficient font size or screen size where applicable 14 
without undue burden on the ability of the entity to make the communication.  The 15 
rules must also provide an exemption for types of communications for which the 16 
required statement would be impossible or impose an unusual hardship due to the 17 
unique format or medium of the communication. 18

than $5,000 100% of the amount of the expenditure in violation, except that an 22 
expenditure for yard signs lacking the required information may result in a maximum 23 
civil penalty of $200.  In assessing a civil penalty, the commission shall consider, among 24 
other things, how widely the communication was disseminated, whether the violation was 25 
intentional, whether the violation occurred as the result of an error by a printer or other 26 
paid vendor and whether the communication conceals or misrepresents the identity of the 27 
person who financed it.  If the person who financed the communication or wh o 28 
committed the violation corrects the violation within 10 days after receiving notification 29 
of the violation from the commission by adding the missing information to the 30 
communication, the commission may decide to assess no civil penalty. 31

authorized committee or agent of the candidate. 15

but the pages must be the same size as the pages of the form.  The commission may 18 
adopt procedures requiring the electronic filing of an independent expenditure report, 19 
as long as the commission receives the statement made under oath or affirmation set 20 
out in paragraph B by the filing deadline and the commission adopts an exception for 21 
persons who lack access to the required technology or the technological ability to file 22 
reports electronically.  The commission may adopt procedures allowing for the 23 
signed statement to be provisionally filed by facsimile or electronic mail, as long as 24 
the report is not considered complete without the filing of the original signed 25 
statement. 26
