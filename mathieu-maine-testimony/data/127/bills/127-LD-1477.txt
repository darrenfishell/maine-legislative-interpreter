 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1658, as enacted by PL 1997, c. 363, §1, is repealed and the 2 
following enacted in its place:  3 
§1658.  Termination of parental rights and responsibilities in cases involving se xual 4 
assault  5 
The parental rights and responsibilities with respect to a specific child conceived as a 6 
result of an act of sexual assault by the parent of that child must be terminated in 7 
accordance with this section.  8 
1.  Petitioner.  The petition for termi nation may be filed by the other parent or, if the 9 
other parent is a minor, the parent or guardian of the other parent.  10 
2.  Petition.  The petitioner may file a petition with the District Court that requests 11 
the termination of the parental rights and respo nsibilities of the parent and alleges:  12 
A.  That the parent was convicted of a crime involving sexual assault, as defined in 13 
Title 17 -A, section 253, 254 or 556, or a comparable crime in another jurisdiction, 14 
that resulted in the conception of the child; or  15 
B.  That the child was conceived as a result of an act of sexual assault, as defined in 16 
Title 17 -A, section 253, 254 or 556, or a comparable crime in another jurisdiction.  17 
3.  Termination.  Except as provided in subsection 4, if the petitioner proves the 18 
allegation in subsection 2, paragraph A by a preponderance of the evidence or the 19 
allegation in subsection 2, paragraph B by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall 20 
terminate the parental rights and responsibilities of the parent.  21 
4.  Exception.  The court is not required to terminate the parental rights and 22 
responsibilities of a parent convicted of gross sexual assault under Title 17 -A, section 23 
253, subsection 1, paragraph B that resulted in the conception of the child if:  24 
A.  The parent or guardia n of the other parent filed the petition;  25 
B.  The other parent informs the court that the sexual act was consensual; and  26 
C.  The other parent opposes the termination of the parental rights and responsibilities 27 
of the parent convicted of the gross sexual as sault.  28 
Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §4055, sub -§1-B is enacted to read:  29 
1-B.  Presumption.  The court shall presume that the parent is unwilling or unable to 30 
protect the child from jeopardy and these circumstances are unlikely to change within a 31 
time that is reasonabl y calculated to meet the child's needs if the court determines by 32 
clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived as a result of an act by the 33 
parent of sexual assault or a comparable crime in another jurisdiction.  For purposes of 34 
this subsecti on, "sexual assault" has the same meaning as in Title 17 -A, section 253, 254 35 
or 556.  A guilty plea or conviction for sexual assault is considered clear and convincing 36 
evidence for purposes of this subsection.  37

 SUMMARY  1 
Current law allows a court to terminat e the parental rights and responsibilities of a 2 
parent who was convicted of a crime involving sexual intercourse when the child for 3 
whom the parental rights and responsibilities are being terminated was conceived as a 4 
result of that crime.  This bill expan ds that law by requiring a court to terminate the 5 
parental rights and responsibilities of a parent if it can be shown by clear and convincing 6 
evidence that the child was conceived as a result of an act of sexual assault by that parent.  7 
This bill also estab lishes a presumption that a parent is unwilling or unable to protect 8 
a child from jeopardy if the child was conceived as a result of an act of sexual assault by 9 
the parent.  10
