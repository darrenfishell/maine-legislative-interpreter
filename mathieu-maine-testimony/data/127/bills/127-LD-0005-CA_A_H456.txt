The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to the Department of Health and Human Services of 
$49,578 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $68,132 in fiscal year 2016-17 for one Office Associate II position to handle 
additional clerical duties expected with a change on the limit of patients a caregiver can serve. A caregiver pays an 
annual application fee of $260 per patient served. As the number of patients a caregiver can serve increases, the 
revenue received will also increase. The department does not have enough infonnation at this time to determine how 
many additional patients will be served. However, this fiscal note assumes that between the existing revenues and the 
increased revenues from the bill, sufficient revenue will be available to cover the increased allocations.
