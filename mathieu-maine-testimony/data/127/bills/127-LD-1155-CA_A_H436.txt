This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $105,847 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $141,130 in fiscal year 2016-
17 for the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services for the additional costs associated with representing an 
incarcerated defendant as compared to someone out on bail. That is based on an estimated 25% of defendants, 1283 
of5133 in calendar 2014, who will require an extra $110 per case for a total of$141,130 annually. This bill will also 
increase costs to county and regional jails. The amount cannot be estimated at this time. Certain defendants 
participating in an electronic monitoring program will pay the full cost of being in that program.
