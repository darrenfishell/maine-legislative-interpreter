Fiscal Note 
A voids unintended tax increase 
Decrease to unbudgeted General Fund revenue 
Legislation in 2015 removed the limit on the amount of military pension benefits that can be deducted under the 
Maine income tax. The interaction of two bills to accomplish this inadvertently removed language that already exis' 
to exempt military pensions from the offset for social security benefits and railroad retirement benefits. There is 
widespread agreement that stiking that language was not intentional. This bill reinstates the exemption for military 
pensions from the offset for social security benefits and railroad retirement benefits. Failure to pass this bill will result 
in a tax increase of an estimated $3,000,000 on approximately 5,300 tax returns for the 2015 tax year. As this 
unintended tax increase was never officially recognized ("booked") into revenue when it became law, reinstating the 
exemption will not require recognition of a revenue decrease. 
Tax forms for 2015 have been constructed assuming quick passage of this bill.
