 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1653, sub -§3, as amended by PL 2009, c. 593, §§2 to 5, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
3.  Best interest of child.  The court, in making an award of parental rights and 4 
responsib ilities with respect to a child, shall apply the standard of the best interest of the 5 
child.  In making decisions regarding the child's residence and parent -child contact, the 6 
court shall consider as primary the safety and well -being of the child.  Another  priority in 7 
the court's decision must be consideration of the value of having both parents involved in 8 
the child's life.   In applying this standard, the court shall consider the following factors:  9 
A.  The age of the child;  10 
B.  The relationship of the chil d with the child's parents and any other persons who 11 
may significantly affect the child's welfare;  12 
C.  The preference of the child, if old enough to express a meaningful preference;  13 
D.  The duration and adequacy of the child's current living arrangements a nd the 14 
desirability of maintaining continuity;  15 
E.  The stability of any proposed living arrangements for the child;  16 
F.  The motivation of the parties involved and their capacities to give the child love, 17 
affection and guidance;  18 
G.  The child's adjustment t o the child's present home, school and community;  19 
H.  The capacity of each parent to allow and encourage frequent and continuing 20 
contact between the child and the other parent, including physical access;  21 
I.  The capacity of each parent to cooperate or to l earn to cooperate in child care;  22 
J.  Methods for assisting parental cooperation and resolving disputes and each 23 
parent's willingness to use those methods;  24 
K.  The effect on the child if one parent has sole authority over the child's upbringing;  25 
L.  The exi stence of domestic abuse between the parents, in the past or currently, and 26 
how that abuse affects:  27 
(1)  The child emotionally;  28 
(2) The safety of the child; and  29 
(3) The other factors listed in this subsection, which must be considered in light 30 
of the pres ence of past or current domestic abuse;  31 
M.  The existence of any history of child abuse by a parent;  32 
N.  All other factors having a reasonable bearing on the physical and psychological 33 
well-being of the child;  34 
O.  A parent's prior willful misuse of the pro tection from abuse process in chapter 35 
101 in order to gain tactical advantage in a proceeding involving the determination of 36 
parental rights and responsibilities of a minor child.  Such willful misuse may only be 37 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0832(01) -1 
 considered if established by clear and conv incing evidence, and if it is further found 1 
by clear and convincing evidence that in the particular circumstances of the parents 2 
and child, that willful misuse tends to show that the acting parent will in the future 3 
have a lessened ability and willingness to cooperate and work with the other parent in 4 
their shared responsibilities for the child.  The court shall articulate findings of fact 5 
whenever relying upon this factor as part of its determination of a child's best interest.  6 
The voluntary dismissal of a protection from abuse petition may not, taken alone, be 7 
treated as evidence of the willful misuse of the protection from abuse process;  8 
P.  If the child is under one year of age, whether the child is being breast -fed; 9 
Q.  The existence of a parent's conv iction for a sex offense or a sexually violent 10 
offense as those terms are defined in Title 34 -A, section 11203;  11 
R.  If there is a person residing with a parent, whether that person:  12 
(1)  Has been convicted of a crime under Title 17 -A, chapter 11 or 12 or a  13 
comparable crime in another jurisdiction;  14 
(2)  Has been adjudicated of a juvenile offense that, if the person had been an 15 
adult at the time of the offense, would have been a violation of Title 17 -A, 16 
chapter 11 or 12; or  17 
(3)  Has been adjudicated in a proc eeding, in which the person was a party, under 18 
Title 22, chapter 1071 as having committed a sexual offense; and  19 
S.  Whether allocation of some or all parental rights and responsibilities would best 20 
support the child's safety and well -being.  21 
SUMMARY  22 
This bi ll amends the best interest of the child standard used by courts in making 23 
decisions regarding parental rights and responsibilities with respect to a child by requiring 24 
the court to consider the value of having both parents involved in the child's life.  25
