Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $3,250 in fiscal year 2015-16. The Legislature'S 
proposed budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 for legislative studies. Whether that amount is sufficient to 
fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. If 
more than 4 meetings are held during the interim the estimated cost for each additional meeting is projected to be 
$750 per meeting for legislative per diem and expenses. The additional costs of providing staffing assistance to the 
study during the interim can be absorbed utilizing existing budgeted staff resources.
