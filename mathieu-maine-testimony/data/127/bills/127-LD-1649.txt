receive the contract rate for the output of the large -scale community solar distributed 27 
generatio n resource, except that after one year of commercial operation any unsubscribed 28 
share of the project must be paid at the wholesale electricity rate. If less than 50% of a 29 
resource's subscriptions are 25 kilowatts or less, any amount less than 50% from 30 
subscriptions of this size are deemed unsubscribed. The project sponsor shall compensate 31 
the standard buyer in an amount equal to the difference between the contract rate and the 32 
wholesale electricity rate for the output of any share deemed unsubscribed under this 33 
subsection.  34 
6.  Determination of subscriber bill credit.   The bill credit to be allocated to each 35 
subscriber to a particular large -scale community solar distributed generation resource 36 
must be based on each subscriber's percentage interest of the tota l production of the large - 37 
scale community solar distributed generation resource for the previous month.  Each 38 
billing month, the value of the credits allocated to each subscriber must be calculated by 39 
multiplying the number of kilowatt -hours equal to each subscriber's share by the 40 
resource's credit rate.  The project sponsor shall provide to the transmission and 41 
distribution utility, on a monthly basis and within reasonable periods set by that utility, 42 
the information required to calculate the bill credit t o be provided to each subscriber.  43 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 Payments to subscribers must be credited against the subscriber's monthly electricity bill 1 
in accordance with section 3481.  2 
The monthly output available for allocation as subscribed or unsubscribed energy must be 3 
determin ed by a revenue -grade meter installed and paid for by the project sponsor.  4 
7.  Exemption.   A project sponsor or subscriber is not considered a public utility or 5 
competitive electricity supplier solely as a result of the project sponsor's or subscriber's 6 
interest or participation in a large -scale community solar distributed generation resource.  7 
8.  Renewable energy credits.   The commission shall develop a standard disclosure 8 
to be provided by the project sponsor to all participating subscribers prior to thei r entering 9 
into a contract under this section that describes the effect of selling the renewable 10 
attributes of exported electricity to the standard buyer and explains how a subscriber may 11 
participate in the voluntary renewable energy credit market.  12 
The com mission shall establish a mechanism to allow a residential or small business 13 
customer who has entered into a long -term contract under this section to purchase 14 
renewable energy credits equivalent to those the customer has sold to the standard solar 15 
buyer at  a price equal to 80% of market value.  16 
9.  Consumer protection.  The commission shall establish by rule consumer 17 
protection standards to protect subscribers from fraud and other unfair and deceptive 18 
business practices.  The commission may impose administrat ive penalties upon a project 19 
sponsor in accordance with chapter 15 and may order restitution for any party injured by 20 
a violation for which a penalty may be assessed pursuant to this subsection.  21 
The commission through its own counsel or through the Attorne y General may apply to 22 
the Superior Court of any county of the State to enforce any lawful order made or action 23 
taken by the commission pursuant to this subsection.  The court may issue such orders, 24 
preliminary or final, as it considers proper under the fa cts established before it.  25 
10.  Disclosures.  A project sponsor selling or reselling a subscription in a large -scale 26 
community solar distributed generation resource shall provide a disclosure to potential 27 
subscribers that includes the following prior to the  sale or resale of that subscription:  28

number of unique bidders and quantity of offered ca pacity to be determined competitive. 6 
If the commission concludes based on these standards that a solicitation is not 7 
competitive, no bidders may be selected and the capacity available in that solicitation 8 
must be deferred to a subsequent solicitation. The commission may adjust the maximum 9 
project size eligible for a solicitation to ensure that there is more than one bid selected.  10 
4.  Bid selection.   Following review of bids, if the commission determines that the 11 
solicitation is competitive, the commission s hall select one or more winning bidders and 12 
direct the standard buyer to negotiate and enter into a contract with the winning bidder or 13 
bidders for a term of 20 years at a specified contract rate to be paid as a bill credit to the 14 
commercial and industrial  customer.  The commission shall select bids that maximize 15 
benefits or minimize costs to all customers.  16 
5.  Determination of bill credit.   The bill credit to be allocated to a commercial and 17 
industrial customer must be based on the total kilowatt -hours of energy production of the 18 
solar distributed generation resource for the previous month.  Each billing month, the 19 
value of the credits must be calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt -hours by 20 
the contract rate.  Payments to customers must be credite d against the customer's monthly 21 
electricity bill in accordance with section 3481.  22 
The monthly production must be determined by a revenue -grade meter installed and paid 23 
for by the participating commercial and industrial customer.  24 
6.  Exemption.   A custome r is not considered a public utility or competitive 25 
electricity supplier solely as a result of entering into a contract with the standard buyer 26 
under this section.  27 
7.  Rules.   The commission shall adopt rules to implement this section by January 1, 28 
2017. R ules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 29 
chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 30 
§3480.  Residential and small business procurement  31 
1.  Long -term contracts.  The standard buyer shall enter into a long -term contract 32 
with a r esidential or small business customer for the output of a distributed generation 33 
resource of 250 kilowatts or less.  The rate paid for the output must be set by the 34 
commission in accordance with subsection 2.  Payments to customers under a contract 35 
under t his section must be credited against the customer's monthly electricity bill in 36 
accordance with section 3481.  37 
2.  Rates.   The commission shall establish the rates to be paid for the output of 38 
distributed generation resources under a contract between a resi dential or small business 39 
customer and the standard buyer under subsection 1.  40 
 
 Page 11 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 The initial rate paid to new installations must decline as the total level of new residential 1 
and small business capacity relative to the targets in section 3475, subsection 4 in creases.  2 
Rates must be sufficient to ensure that the total capacity of installations meets the 3 
residential and small business procurement targets set forth in section 3475, subsection 4.  4 
In determining whether rates are sufficient, the commission shall co nsider independent 5 
analysis of installation costs and development projections in establishing the rates, 6 
including but not limited to those from the United States Department of Energy, Office of 7 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, National Renewable En ergy Laboratory.  8 
Rates must be set at levels intended to ensure that total annual contract payments for new 9 
solar distributed generation resources procured under this section are not expected to 10 
exceed $10,500,000 per year in 2022, if the procurement targe ts in section 3475, 11 
subsection 4 are met, assuming an export rate of 50% and that the adjustment mechanism 12 
in subsection 3 is not triggered.  Rates set under this subsection may be constant or 13 
increase over the term of the contract.  14 
The commission may esta blish separate rates for specific types of distributed generation 15 
resources or additional incentives or a per kilowatt -hour increase in contract price for 16 
resources with attributes that maximize benefits or lower costs to all customers.  17 
3.  Rate adjustment  mechanism.   The commission shall establish an adjustment 18 
mechanism to automatically increase rates for new customers by a specified amount if the 19 
total solar distributed generation resource capacity installed by residential and small 20 
business customers un der this section is less than 85% of the applicable target established 21 
in section 3475, subsection 4.  The evaluation to determine whether this adjustment is 22 
triggered must occur at 6 -month intervals.  23 
4.  Self-consumption.   Notwithstanding section 1, a res idential or small business 24 
customer may offset that customer's own consumption using that customer's distributed 25 
generation resource on an hourly basis. The commission may specify a longer period for 26 
measuring self -consumption if it determines that a trans mission and distribution utility 27 
cannot track consumption on an hourly basis using a standard residential meter.  28 
5.  Small -scale community distributed generation resources.   Residential and 29 
small business customers may jointly participate in a single distr ibuted generation 30 
resource and receive payments under subsection 1 in proportion to each contracted share 31 
of the resource.  The commission shall ensure that distributed generation resources with 32 
shared ownership at the same location are separate facilities .  A customer or owner is not 33 
considered a public utility or competitive electricity supplier solely as a result of interest 34 
or participation in a single shared distributed generation resource under this subsection.  35 
6.  Continuation of net energy billing.   The commission's net energy billing rules 36 
existing on the effective date of this subsection remain in effect, without modification, for 37 
all customers until new rules pursuant to subsection 10 take effect.  On the effective date 38 
of the rules established pu rsuant to subsection 10, net energy billing pursuant to section 39 
3209 -A is not available to new customers, unless reinstated pursuant to the program 40 
review described in subsection 11.  41 
 
 Page 12 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 7.  Existing net energy billing customers.   A customer who has elected ne t energy 1 
billing pursuant to section 3209 -A prior to the effective date of rules established pursuant 2 
to subsection 10 continues to be eligible for compensation in the form of a kilowatt -hour 3 
credit on the customer's monthly electricity bill for generation  in excess of that customer's 4 
consumption for that month, which may be carried forward and applied to the customer's 5 
subsequent monthly electricity bills over 12 months, or the financial equivalent of that 6 
credit, for 12 years from the effective date of ru les established pursuant to subsection 10.  7 
The commission shall establish a process to permit customers under this subsection to 8 
enter into contracts and receive payments under subsections 1 and 2.  9 
A customer who has elected net energy billing between Jan uary 1, 2016 and the effective 10 
date of the rules established pursuant to subsection 10 may choose to enter into a contract 11 
at the initial rate established by the commission under subsection 2 prior to any decline in 12 
rate, as long as that customer makes tha t choice within one year of the effective date of 13 
the rules.  14 
The capacity of a net energy billing customer who has installed a solar distributed 15 
generation resource and participated in net energy billing under section 3209 -A prior to 16 
the effective date of rules established pursuant to subsection 10 and elects to enter into a 17 
long-term contract under this subsection may not be counted against the procurement 18 
target in section 3475, subsection 4 or the cap on total annual contract payments under 19 
subsection 2 or trigger any decline in prices.  20 
No later than December 31, 2028, the commission shall initiate a proceeding to consider 21 
methods to allow an owner of a distributed generation resource to continue to offset that 22 
owner's own consumption and receive fair com pensation for exported power in a manner 23 
that benefits all ratepayers.  24 
8.  Renewable energy credits.   A participating residential or small business 25 
customer retains all environmental attributes associated with electricity generated by a 26 
distributed generat ion resource that is not exported to the grid and sold to the standard 27 
buyer.  The commission shall develop a standard disclosure to be provided to all 28 
participating customers prior to their entering into a contract under this section that 29 
describes the ef fect of selling the renewable attributes of exported electricity to the 30 
standard buyer and explains how a customer may participate in the voluntary renewable 31 
energy credit market.  32 
The commission shall establish a mechanism to allow a residential or small b usiness 33 
customer who has entered into a long -term contract under this section to purchase 34 
renewable energy credits equivalent to those the customer has sold to the standard solar 35 
buyer at a price equal to 80% of market value.  36 
9.  Consumer -owned utility exe mption.   This section does not apply to a consumer - 37 
owned transmission and distribution utility and its customers.  38 
10.  Rules.  The commission shall provisionally adopt rules to implement this section 39 
by December 31, 2016.  Rules adopted under this subsectio n are major substantive rules 40 
as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 41 
11.  Program review.   By 18 months after the effective date of rules adopted 42 
pursuant to subsection 10, or when 21 megawatts of capacity have been installed by 43 
 
 Page 13 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 residential an d small business customers pursuant to this section, whichever is earlier, the 1 
commission shall initiate an expedited proceeding to determine whether:  2 
A.  The procurement targets in section 3475, subsection 4 are likely to be met through 3 
2022; and  4 
B.  The total cost to all customers is likely to be less than if the procurement targets in 5 
section 3475, subsection 4 were installed under the commission's net energy billing 6 
rules.  7 
If the commission concludes that both conditions under paragraphs A and B will be  met, 8 
the rules established pursuant to subsection 10 remain in effect, and net energy billing 9 
pursuant to section 3209 -A is not available to new customers in the future.  10 
If the commission concludes that the condition under paragraph A or B will not be met , 11 
the commission shall make findings regarding the reasons the condition will not be met 12 
and provide a report summarizing its conclusions to the joint standing committee of the 13 
Legislature having jurisdiction over utility matters within 30 days of the star t of the 14 
Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature.  If the commission determines that the 15 
rules adopted under this section can be modified to enable the program to meet 16 
procurement targets or reduce costs so that the conditions under paragraphs A an d B are 17 
likely to be met in the future, it shall make and submit such changes to the Second 18 
Regular Session of the 129th Legislature. If the commission determines that these rules 19 
cannot be modified to meet these targets or reduce costs, the commission sha ll review its 20 
net energy billing rules or recommend alternative mechanisms to support distributed 21 
generation in a manner that benefits all ratepayers. If the commission does not propose 22 
changes to the rules adopted pursuant to subsection 10 or new rules ar e not adopted 23 
within 60 days of the adjournment of the Second Regular Session of the 129th 24 
Legislature, net energy billing pursuant to section 3209 -A must be made available to new 25 
customers on that date.   26 
§3481.  Bill credits  27 
This section applies to any c redits assigned to a customer's bill under this chapter.  28 
If the value of the credit to be applied to a customer's bill is less than the amount 29 
owed by the customer at the end of the applicable billing period, the customer must be 30 
billed for the difference between the amount shown on the bill and the value of the 31 
available credits.  32 
If the value of the credits to be applied to a customer's bill is greater than the amount 33 
owed by the customer at the end of the billing period, the remaining value of the credit 34 
must carry over from month to month until a specified date each year.  The commission 35 
shall establish a minimum of 2 standard credit expiration dates that provide customers the 36 
opportunity to use bill credits to the maximum extent practicable in a given 12 -month 37 
period.  Any remaining credits as of that date must be credited to the standard buyer and 38 
may not be applied against any future customer bill.  39 
Sec. 7.  Siting of solar distributed generation resources.   By January 1, 2019, 40 
the Public Utilities Commi ssion shall report to the joint standing committees of the 41 
Legislature having jurisdiction over utility matters and natural resources matters the 42 
 
 Page 14 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 number of new solar distributed generation resources procured pursuant to the Maine 1 
Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, sections 3477 to 3479 that have been built on pre -existing 2 
impervious surfaces or brownfields where future development is affected by the presence 3 
or potential presence of a hazardous substance.  The report must include measures to 4 
encourage siting of distributed generation resources at such locations identified by the 5 
commission in cooperation with the Department of Environmental Protection.  6 
SUMMARY  7 
This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and 8 
Technology pursuant t o Resolve 2015, chapter 37, section 2.  The resolve directed the 9 
Public Utilities Commission to convene a stakeholder group to develop an alternative to 10 
net energy billing.  This bill reflects the consensus developed in that process and 11 
subsequent negotiat ions between stakeholders and establishes a comprehensive 12 
framework to support distributed generation in Maine.  13 
The committee has not taken a position on the substance of this bill, and by reporting 14 
this bill out, the committee is not suggesting and does n ot intend to suggest that it agrees 15 
or disagrees with any aspect of this bill.  The committee is reporting the bill out for the 16 
sole purpose of turning the commission's proposal into a printed bill that can be referred 17 
to the committee for an appropriate p ublic hearing and subsequent processing in the 18 
normal course.  The committee is taking this action to ensure clarity and transparency in 19 
the legislative review of the proposal.  20 
The bill directs the Public Utilities Commission to enter into long -term contra cts with 21 
a duration of 20 years for the procurement of 248 megawatts of solar energy over a 5 -year 22 
period beginning in 2017. The bill specifies that 24% or 60 megawatts are to be allotted 23 
to grid -scale solar distributed generation resources; 19% or 45 mega watts to large -scale 24 
community solar distributed generation resources; 10% or 25 megawatts to commercial 25 
and industrial distributed generation resources; and 47% or 118 megawatts to residential 26 
and small business distributed generation resources.  27 
The bill creates a standard buyer, which the bill specifies is the investor -owned 28 
transmission and distribution utility in its service territory. The bill allows the 29 
commission to designate another entity as the standard buyer if it determines it is in the 30 
best int erest of ratepayers to do so. The purpose of the standard buyer is to purchase the 31 
output of each category of distributed generation resource, aggregate the portfolio of 32 
distributed generation resources procured and sell it into the relevant New England 33 
markets.  34 
The bill directs the commission to conduct competitive solicitations for 20% of the 5 - 35 
year target procurement for long -term contracts for the output of grid -scale, large -scale 36 
community, and commercial and industrial solar distributed generation. Th e frequency of 37 
solicitation varies with the particular category of distributed generation resource. The bill 38 
directs the commission and standard buyer to develop a contract prior to a solicitation that 39 
will ensure that projects proceed to commercial operat ion on a reasonable timeline and 40 
commits all parties to commercially reasonable behavior. The bill gives the commission 41 
authority to establish requirements for bidder eligibility and standards to ensure 42 
 
 Page 15 - 127LR2731(01) -1 
 competition in the bidding process. The bill also spe cifies that if the solicitation is 1 
deemed competitive the commission must select one or more winning bids and direct the 2 
standard buyer to negotiate and enter into a contract with the winning bidder or bidders. 3 
The bill requires the commission to select bi ds that maximize the benefits or minimize the 4 
costs to all ratepayers.  5 
The bill provides that residential and small business customers receive 20 -year 6 
contracts at a set price for new distributed generation resources that are 250 kilowatts or 7 
less.  The bi ll specifies that those customers would have the option of selling their entire 8 
output or using their generation to offset their electric consumption with the ability to sell 9 
any excess electricity at prices established under the contracts. The bill provid es that the 10 
commission would set the contract price and the price new customers receive would 11 
decrease over time as the installations increase. Contract prices set by the commission 12 
must be high enough to meet the specified targets but be below a cap on th e overall cost 13 
of this portion of the program. The bill also allows the commission to establish a rate 14 
adjustment mechanism to increase rates for new customers to increase the number of 15 
installations and to meet targets.  16 
The bill specifies that existing n et metering customers may continue to net meter 17 
under commission rules for 12 years after the effective date of major substantive rules 18 
adopted as required by the bill to implement the residential and small business solar 19 
program. The bill allows existing net metering customers to enter into a long -term 20 
contract under the new program, but does not allow new customers to participate in net 21 
metering.  22 
The bill requires the commission to initiate a proceeding 18 months after the effective 23 
date of major substan tive rules adopted to implement the residential and small business 24 
solar program, or 21 megawatts of capacity has been installed, whichever is sooner, to 25 
determine if installation targets are likely to be met by 2022, and the total cost to all 26 
customers is  likely to be less using long -term contracts, rather than net metering. The bill 27 
specifies that if the commission does not find that installation targets are going to be met 28 
and long -term contracts are not going to be more cost -effective than net metering,  the 29 
commission may modify the rules, with legislative approval, to meet the goals and reduce 30 
costs. If the rules cannot be modified and the commission does not propose an alternative 31 
to the Second Regular Session of the 129th Legislature, or if the Legisl ature fails to act, 32 
then net metering will be available to new customers.  33 
The bill also allows for a solar power offer, in addition to the existing green power 34 
offer under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, section 3212 -A, that is available to all 35 
residential and small commercial electricity customers. Like the green power offer, the 36 
solar power offer sunsets on April 1, 2021.  37
