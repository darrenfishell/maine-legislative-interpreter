127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 686, L.D. 991, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend Maine's Genetically Modified Food Products Labeling Law" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. PL 2013, c. 436, ยง2, sub-ยง2 is amended to read. 
2. Repeal. If no certification has been made by the Commissioner of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry under subsection 1 before January 1, ~ 2022, this Act is 
repealed on that date.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report, strikes and replaces the bill. It extends 
by 4 years, from 2018 to 2022, the date before which 5 contiguous states, including 
Maine, have to adopt mandatory labeling of genetically engineered food in order for 
Maine's law to go into effect. If that contingency is not met, Maine's law is repealed.

Fiscal Note 
Contingent future biennium cost increase -General Fund "~ 
Under current law, PL 2013, c. 436 requires that if at least five contiguous states, including Maine, adopt legislation 
requiring mandatory labeling of genetically engineered food by January 1, 2018, then food offered for retail sale that 
is genetically engineered requires disclosure. Currently, five contiguous states have not adopted this type of 
legislation and PL 2013, c. 436 will be repealed on January 1, 2018 if this does not change. This bill extends the _,,, 
repeal date to January 1, 2022, resulting in the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry incurring annual 
General Fund costs of $156,915 for one Consumer Protection Inspector position, one Office Associate II position and 
other related costs if at least five contiguous states adopt this type of legislation before January 1, 2022.
