Increasing the amount of vacation time that is exempt from being included as deductible income when calculating a 
claimant's unemployment compensation benefit amount from the equivalent of 4 weeks to the equivalent of 12 weeks 
will increase costs to the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 due to an 
increase in benefit payments. According to information provided by the Department of Labor, had this provision been 
in place in 2014, the estimated increase in benefit costs would have been between $120,000 and $200,000. 
This expansion of benefits may potentially affect the contribution rate schedule in future biennia. The impact to all 
employers and the timing of the impact can not be determined at this time and will depend on the level of benefits 
paid, contributions received and the balance of the trust fund when the contribution schedule is calculated. 
This bill may increase unemployment costs for executive branch departments and agencies that are in direct 
reimbursement status. Although the amount will depend on actual experience, the Department of Labor estimates 
that, had this provision been in place in 2014, the additional cost to the State would have been approximately $5,858. 
An analysis of the State's unemployment benefit expenditures for fiscal year 2013-14 indicates that approximately 
49.8% were from the General Fund, 21.1 % were from Other Special Revenue Funds and 13.9% were from the 
Highway Fund. 
This bill includes a one-time Federal Expenditures Fund allocation of $96,943 in fiscal year 2015-16 to the 
Employment Security Services program within the Department of Labor for the costs associated with updating its 
unemployment consortium system and for revising its publications.
