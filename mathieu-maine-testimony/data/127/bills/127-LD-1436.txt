 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, most tourism in Maine occurs between Memorial Day and Labor Day 3 
each year; and  4 
Whereas, tourists who visited Maine in 2014 when surveyed cited food and 5 
beverage options as among the highest areas of interest; and  6 
Whereas, overnight visitors had median expenditures of $200 per party for food and 7 
beverages in 2014; and  8 
Whereas, tourists from Mass achusetts and New York represented approximately 9 
40% of overnight visitors to Maine in 2014 and both of those states allow alcoholic 10 
beverages to be served on the premises until 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., respectively; and  11 
Whereas, Maine's hospitality industry los es opportunities to cater to out -of-state 12 
customers accustomed to longer hours of on -premises liquor service and this loss results 13

Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90 -day period 15
