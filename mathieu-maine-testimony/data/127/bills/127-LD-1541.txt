5-A.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, for a person convicted of 34

A.    Except as otherwise provided i n paragraphs B and C, the minimum sentence of 36 
imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows: When the sentencing class 37

 Page 3 - 127LR2284(01) -1 
 B.  The cou rt may impose a sentence other than a minimum unsuspended term of 1 
imprisonment set forth in paragraph A, if:  2 
(1)  The court finds by substantial evidence that:  3 
(a)  Imposition of a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 4 
paragraph A will result in  substantial injustice to the defendant.  In making 5 
this determination, the court shall consider, among other considerations, 6 
whether the defendant did not know and reasonably should not have known 7 
that the victim was less than 18 years of age;  8 
(b)  Failur e to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 9 
paragraph A will not have an adverse effect on public safety; and  10 
(c)  Failure to impose a minimum unsuspended term of imprisonment under 11 
paragraph A will not appreciably impair the effect of par agraph A in 12 
deterring others from violating section 1105 -A, 1105 -B, 1105 -C or 1105 -D; 13 
and 14 
(2)  The court finds that:  15 
(c)  The defendant's background, attitude and prospects for rehabilitation and 16 
the nature of the victim and the offense indicate that impos ition of a sentence 17 
under paragraph A would frustrate the general purposes of sentencing set 18 
forth in section 1151.  19 
If the court imposes a sentence under this paragraph, the court shall state in writing 20 
its reasons for its findings and for imposing a sente nce under this paragraph rather 21 
than under paragraph A; and  22 
C.    If the court imposes a sentence under paragraph B, the minimum sentence of 23 
imprisonment, which may not be suspended, is as follows: When the sentencing class 24 
is Class A, the minimum term of imprisonment is 9 months; when the sentencing is 25 
Class B, the minimum term of imprisonment is 6 months; and, with the exception of 26 
trafficking or furnishing marijuana under section 1105 -A or 1105 -C, when the 27 
sentencing class is Class C, the minimum term of  imprisonment is 3 months.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill raises the class of crime for the illegal importation of scheduled drugs from a 30 
Class C crime to a Class B crime if the drug is a schedule W drug and from a Class D 31 
crime to a Class C crime if the drug is a sche dule X, Y or Z drug.  32 
The bill also creates the crime of aggravated illegal importation of scheduled drugs.  33 
Under the new crime, which is based on the crime of aggravated trafficking of scheduled 34 
drugs, certain aggravating factors, such as a prior convicti on, using a child under 18 years 35 
of age to assist with the illegal importation or the quantity of drugs being imported, raise 36 
the class of crime by one class.  37 
This bill specifies that the minimum sentence of imprisonment is 4 years for a Class 38 
A violation of illegal importation of drugs or aggravated illegal importation of drugs and 39 
2 years for a Class B violation of those crimes.  40
