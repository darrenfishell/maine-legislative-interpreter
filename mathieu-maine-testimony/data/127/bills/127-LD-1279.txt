 SUMMARY  1 
This bill  establishes a framework for the conduct of advance deposit wagering on 2 
harness and thoroughbred racing.  The bill provides that commercial tracks and 3 
established off -track betting facilities are eligible for a license to accept wagers made by 4 
telephone or  electronic communication using advance deposit wagering.  Advance 5 
deposit wagering is a form of pari -mutuel wagering in which a bettor establishes an 6 
account from which wagers on horse races are made and into which prizes are deposited.  7 
An advance deposi t wager licensee receives a percentage of each wager made using 8 
advance deposit wagering.  Advance deposit wagering licenses are issued by the State 9 
Harness Racing Commission.  The bill prescribes the duties of the commission with 10 
regard to enforcement and  administration of laws and rules that govern advance deposit 11 
wagering.  The bill also authorizes multijurisdictional account wagering providers from 12 
outside the State to provide advance deposit wagering.  13
