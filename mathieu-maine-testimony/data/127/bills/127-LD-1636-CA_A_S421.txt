manage endangered and threatened species in conjunction with human activity is key to 
the protection and recovery of a listed species; and 
Whereas, this legislation provides the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife 
with tools necessary to properly manage listed endangered and threatened species; and

therefore,'
