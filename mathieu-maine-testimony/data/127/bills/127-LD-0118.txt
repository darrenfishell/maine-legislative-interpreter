 Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, thi s 1 
legislation takes effect when approved.  2 
SUMMARY  3 
Under current law, if a municipality forecloses on a parcel of real estate for failure to 4 
pay taxes owed on that real estate, the municipality is under no obligation to return any 5 
funds that exceed the amou nt owed in taxes after the sale of the property.  6 
This bill authorizes a municipality that forecloses on residential real estate to return 7 
the excess funds, after subtracting the tax lien, interest, fees for recording the lien, costs 8 
of mailing notice, cour t costs, taxes that would have been assessed while the property was 9 
held by the municipality and any other expenses incurred in disposing of the real estate.  10
