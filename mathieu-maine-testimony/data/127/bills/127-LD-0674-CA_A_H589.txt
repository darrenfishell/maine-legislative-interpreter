This bill includes ongoing General Fund appropriations of $16,500 per year to the Bureau of Labor Standards within 
the Maine Department of Labor beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 and continuing until the minimum wage reaches 
$10.00 per hour in January of 2020. Of this annual amount, $3,500 per year is for updating the minimum wage 
poster and other related publications, $5,000 is for postage costs to distribute the updated poster and publications and 
$8,000 is for travel costs associated with compliance, education and outreach. 
The 4-step increase in the minimum wage may not increase salary costs to the State until the $10.00 per hour rate 
begins on January 1, 2020. The future State Government impact of the changes to the minimum wage will depend on 
the salary schedules in place at the time the increases occur and cannot be estimated at this time. 
The increased wages required by this initiative would create costs to municipalites which would vary by individual 
municipality. As with State Government, the municipal impact would depend on the existing rates of pay for the 
lowest paid employees in each municipality at the time a higher wage would be imposed and cannot be estimated at 
this time.
