 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §706, 5th ¶, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 544, §5 and affected by 2 
§7, is amended to read:  3 
The assessor or assessors, chief assessor or State Tax Assessor may require the 4 
taxpayer t o answer in writing all proper inquiries as to the nature, situation and value of 5 
the taxpayer's property liable to be taxed in the State or subject to exemption pursuant to 6 
subchapter 4 -C. As may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the value of property 7 
according to the income approach to value pursuant to the requirements of section 208 -A 8 
or generally accepted assessing practices, these inquiries may seek information about 9 
income and expenses, manufacturing or operational efficiencies, manufactured or 10 
generated sales price trends or other related information. A taxpayer has 30 days from 11 
receipt of such an inquiry to respond. Upon written request, a taxpayer is entitled to a 30 - 12 
day extension to respond to the inquiry and the assessor may at any time grant additional 13 
extensions upon written request. Information provided by the taxpayer in response to an 14 
inquiry that is proprietary information, and clearly labeled by the taxpayer as proprietary 15 
and confidential information, is confidential and is exempt from the provisions of Title 1, 16 
chapter 13. An assessor of the taxing jurisdiction may not allow the inspection of or 17 
otherwise release such proprietary information to anyone other than the State Tax 18 
Assessor, who shall treat such proprietary information as sub ject to section 191, 19 
subsection 1, except that the exemption provided in section 191, subsection 2, paragraph I 20 
does not apply to such proprietary information , or, when such proprietary information has 21 
the potential to reduce the valuation of a municipalit y by more than 5% due to a reduction 22 
in the property valuation of that taxpayer, the information may be shared in executive 23 
session of the municipal officers of the affected municipality, with the condition that such 24 
information remains confidential inform ation exempt from the provisions of Title 1, 25 
chapter 13 .  As used in this subsection, "proprietary information" means information that 26 
is a trade secret or production, commercial or financial information the disclosure of 27 
which would impair the competitive  position of the person submitting the information 28 
and would make available information not otherwise publicly available and information 29 
protected from disclosure by federal or state law or regulations.  A person who knowingly 30 
violates the confidentiality provisions of this paragraph commits a Class E crime.  31 
SUMMARY  32 
This bill allows a taxpayer's proprietary information, which is considered confidential 33 
information exempt from the freedom of access laws, to be shared with the municipal 34 
officers meeting in ex ecutive session when such information has the potential to reduce 35 
the valuation of the municipality by more than 5% due to a reduction in the property 36 
valuation of that taxpayer.  37
