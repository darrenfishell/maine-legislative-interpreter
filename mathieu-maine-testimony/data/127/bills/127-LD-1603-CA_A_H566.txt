6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment strikes the bill and does the following. 
8 1. The amendment designates the classes of crime in the subsections or paragraphs of 
9 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 393 on prohibited possession of firearms to 
10 conform to the Maine Criminal Code drafting standards. The amendment repeals the 
11 subsection that does not conform to current drafting standards. 
12 2. Like the bill, the amendment terminates the 5-year period of prohibited possession 
13 of firearms when charges of violating the prohibition for domestic violence offenses are 
14 dismissed at the end of a period of deferred disposition. 
15 3. Like the bill, the amendment defines or standardizes the use of certain terms and 
16 references to those terms in the laws governing interception of wire and oral 
17 communications to reference actions taken under the Criminal History Record 
18 Information Act and the Intelligence and Investigative Record Information Act; the 
19 amendment also makes these changes in the laws governing the Department of 
20 Corrections. 
21 4. Like the bill, the amendment amends the Class C sentencing provision for a 
22 person convicted of stalking who has one or more prior convictions to clarify that 
23 although the court continues to have discretion to impose any other authorized sentencing 
24 alternative, the court is required to impose a sentencing alternative that includes a term of 
25 imprisonment of at least one year. 
26 5. Like the bill, the amendment amends the Class B sentencing provision for a 
27 person convicted of stalking who has one or more prior convictions, at least one of which 
28 was for stalking 2 or more specific persons that are members of an identifiable group, to 
29 require the court in determining the basic term of imprisonment as the first step in the 
30 sentencing process to select a term of at least 2 years. 
31 6. Like the bill, the amendment strikes redundant provisions requiring the court, in 
32 imposing a sentencing alternative for the crime of stalking, to consider whether the victim 
33 was being stalked by the person being sentenced. 
34 Current law provides that for the purpose of imposing a sentence for certain crimes, if 
35 the defendant has 2 or more convictions for those crimes, the sentencing class for the 
36 crime is one class higher. Like the bill, the amendment provides that an attempt to 
37 commit such crimes also results in a higher sentencing class.
