24 SUMMARY 
25 The bill eliminates language allowing mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect 
26 to report to an institution, facility or agency rather than directly to the Department of 
27 Health and Human Services. This amendment retains the current language and instead 
28 requires a mandated reporter, described as the "notifying person," to acknowledge in 
29 writing that the mandated reporter has received confirmation that the report has been 
30 made by the institution, facility or agency to the department. If the mandated reporter 
31 does not receive that confirmation within 24 hours of notifying the institution, facility or 
32 agency, the mandated reporter is required to report directly to the department. 
33 The amendment also prohibits an employer from taking any action to prevent or 
34 discourage an employee from making a report. 
35 The amendment adds similar requirements for reports that must be made to the 
36 appropriate district attorney's office.
