Extend the Period of Time for Persons Who Purchase Special Fuel and Gasoline for OffÂ­
highway Use To Apply for the Special Fuel and Gasoline Tax Refunds" 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the

'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, many taxpayers when they file income tax returns request a fuel tax 
refund for fuel purchased for off-highway purposes such as farming and fishing; and 
Whereas, it is important to change the period for which refund requests may be 
made during the income tax filing period ending April 15, 2015; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore,' 
Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'
