Whereas, Maine workers who earn at or near the minimum wage are among the 
most economically vulnerable of our citizens; and 
Whereas, Maine is one of 2 states facing a so-called demographic winter 
characterized by fewer births than deaths and fewer new workers entering the workforce 
than older workers retiring from it; and 
Whereas, Maine's so-called demographic winter has created a net workforce 
shortage; and 
Whereas, an increase in the minimum wage addresses this workforce shortage by 
attracting more workers; and 
Whereas, to effect a minimum wage increase that Maine's small businesses can 
afford requires reasonable lead time for those employers to plan for the implementation 
of such an increase; and 
Whereas, 6 months from the immediate enactment of this legislation is the shortest 
time period needed for employers to plan for the need to implement a higher wage 
without causing business disruptions and imposing costs adverse to employee welfare; 
and 
Whereas, this legislation raises the mmnnum wage on October 1, 2016 and 
emergency enactment is necessary to allow employers to plan for implementation without 
business disruptions and imposing costs adverse to employee welfare; and
