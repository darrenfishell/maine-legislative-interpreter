Whereas, current law discourages potential applicants for licensure as architects 7

SUMMARY  18 
This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, 19 
Research and Economic Development pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 3, 20 
section 955.  The b ill authorizes the Maine State Board for Licensure of Architects, 21 
Landscape Architects and Interior Designers to specify, by rule, the required amount of 22 
practical experience under the supervision of an experienced architect or architects that an 23 
applicant  for licensure as an architect must complete before obtaining a license.  The bill 24 
also removes the requirement that candidates for a forester license submit applications 25 
and examination fees to the Board of Licensure of Foresters; in current practice, 26 
candidates submit their applications and examination fees to a board -approved testing 27 
company rather than directly to the board.  28

and subsequent processing in the normal course.  The committee is taking this action to 35 
ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the department's proposal.  36
