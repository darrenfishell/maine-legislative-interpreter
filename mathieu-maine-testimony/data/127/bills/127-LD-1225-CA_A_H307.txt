entire length of the shore frontage of the property from which the developed swim area or 
the area delineated by a swim line extends or 200 feet, whichever is greater, except that in 
no event may the developed swim area or the area delineated by a swim line extend 
beyond the shore frontage of the property. The length of the developed swim area or of 
an area delineated by a swim line must be measured parallel to the shore;

leaves in place the general civil penalty applicable under the Maine Revised Statutes, 
Title 12, section 1806;
