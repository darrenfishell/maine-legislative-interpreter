 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to amend the site location of development laws, the Maine Revised 5 
Statutes, Title 38, chapter 3,  subchapter 1, article 6, to provide that any surface water 6 
generated by an expansion project and any new or existing system through which that 7 
water flows must comply with the surface water regulatory standards in effect at the time 8 
the expansion applicat ion is filed if:  9 
1.  A development is being expanded and the existing, original development was 10 
permitted by a municipality, did not require a permit under the site location of 11 
development laws and is being expanded in a manner that triggers the need for a  permit; 12 
or 13 
2.  A development is being expanded and an expansion of the development was 14 
previously permitted under the site location of development laws.  15 
If the criteria are not met and as long as a development complied with the applicable 16 
standards at the  time the existing, original development was created, the surface water 17 
generated by the existing, original development and the systems through which that water 18 
flows do not need to comply with the regulatory standards in effect at the time the 19 
expansion a pplication is filed.  20
