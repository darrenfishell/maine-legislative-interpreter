Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment eliminates the General Fund appropriations in the bill that funded a dyslexia coordinator position 
within the Depmiment of Education. According to the department, LD 1019, the 2016-2017 Biennial Budget, as 
enacted by the Legislature, includes a federally funded Education Specialist III position as part of a reorganization of 
the Special Services Team which can be used for the dyslexia coordinator and the General Fund position included in 
this bill will not be needed.
