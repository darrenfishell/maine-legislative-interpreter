 SUMMARY  1 
This bill reforms state marijuana laws by  establishing an excise tax on marijuana, 2 
allowing the personal use and cultivation of cannabis and allowing, regulating and 3 
licensing certain commercial cannabis -related activities, while providing provisions to 4 
protect persons under 21 years of age, empl oyers and schools.  5 
Part A of the bill establishes a 10% sales tax on cannabis, which is in addition to the 6 
current sales and use tax. Revenue from the sales tax on cannabis is distributed on a 7 
monthly basis as follows:  8 
1.  Ten percent each to regulate cann abis establishments; to counties and 9 
municipalities, based on the ratio of sales of cannabis products in the municipality or 10 
county to the sales of cannabis products in the State; to the Fund for a Healthy Maine for 11 
the elderly low -cost drug program; to th e Department of Education for school 12 
construction; to conduct research on cannabis; to the Department of Health and Human 13 
Services, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for a public awareness 14 
campaign to reduce the use of cannabis by persons und er 21 years of age and the use of 15 
alcohol and tobacco; and to the Department of Health and Human Services to obtain 16 
federal funding for MaineCare; and  17 
2.  The balance to the General Fund.  18 
Part A directs the Department of Administrative and Financial Servic es, Bureau of 19 
Revenue Services to report annually, beginning January 30, 2017, the amount of tax 20 
revenue generated and the amount distributed to each program to the joint standing 21 
committees of the Legislature having jurisdiction over appropriations and fi nancial affairs 22 
and taxation matters. The bill directs the Bureau of Revenue Services to review methods 23 
for ensuring that all cannabis that is sold in the State is assessed and to report its findings 24 
and recommendations to the joint standing committee of t he Legislature having 25 
jurisdiction over taxation matters by February 15, 2017.  26 
Part B removes the civil violation for possession of cannabis by adults 21 years of 27 
age and older and specifies a civil fine of at least $100 for possession of cannabis by a 28 
person under 21 years of age; a judge may, as an alternative or in addition to the fine, 29 
assign the person to perform work for the State, a subdivision of the State, a public entity 30 
or a charity.  31 
Part C of the bill establishes the Cannabis Regulation Act, whi ch allows a person 21 32 
years of age or older to possess, purchase and use cannabis within certain limits and to 33 
cultivate a limited amount of cannabis for personal use. It allows a person to possess 34 
cannabis paraphernalia and up to 1 ounce of cannabis. It a llows a person to cultivate up to 35 
3 cannabis plants and up to 6 seedlings, and to purchase up to 1 ounce of cannabis, 36 
cannabis paraphernalia and cannabis seedlings from someone who is licensed to sell these 37 
products. The bill imposes restrictions on cannab is use similar to those that apply to 38 
tobacco use regarding smoking in public places. It requires those cultivating cannabis to 39 
secure the cannabis from access by unauthorized persons and by minors.  40 
 
 Page 32 - 127LR1783(01) -1 
 Part C includes specific requirements for the operations of commercial cannabis - 1 
related activities regarding the location of operations, security measures, labeling and 2 
record keeping. It allows localities to limit, regulate or ban the issuance of cannabis - 3 
related licenses. It further limits the number of retail  cannabis stores based on the size of 4 
the municipality.  Enforcement and administration of the Cannabis Regulation Act is the 5 
responsibility of the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of 6 
Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations, w hich is renamed the Bureau of Alcoholic 7 
Beverages, Cannabis and Lottery Operations.  The bureau is required to adopt rules for 8 
the licensing and regulation of cannabis establishments; upon the adoption of such rules, 9 
each dispensary registered under the Ma ine Medical Use of Marijuana Act is granted a 10 
provisional license to operate a commercial cannabis cultivation facility, a cannabis 11 
product manufacturing facility and a retail cannabis store.  Included in the rules must be a 12 
provision giving preference for  licensing to a registered dispensary under the Maine 13 
Medical Use of Marijuana Act.  A dispensary organized as a nonprofit corporation that 14 
reorganizes under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 13 -C is deemed to be the same 15 
dispensary for licensing purposes.   Part C creates the Cannabis Regulation and Licensing 16 
Fund to provide a funding mechanism for regulation of commercial cannabis -related 17 
activities and the Cannabis Research Fund to fund research on cannabis; both funds are 18 
funded by revenue from the sales  tax on cannabis.  19 
Part C also amends the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act to remove the 20 
requirement that dispensaries be nonprofit corporations, remove the restriction on how 21 
much marijuana may be transferred by a primary caregiver for compensation, requ ire a 22 
primary caregiver's cultivation facility to be open to reasonable inspection by the 23 
Department of Health and Human Services and cap the number of primary caregivers 24 
registered with the department at the number registered with the department on Decemb er 25 
31, 2015.  26 
Finally, Part C requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to 27 
adopt rules regulating the use of pesticides in cannabis cultivation operations.  28 
Part D renames the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations withi n the 29 
Department of Administrative and Financial Services, the Bureau of Alcoholic 30 
Beverages, Cannabis and Lottery Operations.  31 
Part E updates the exceptions to the laws restricting possession of marijuana in the 32 
Maine Criminal Code to reflect the use permi tted by this legislation.  Part E also provides 33 
that the odor of cannabis does not create probable cause of criminal activity.  34 
Part F removes provisions in the law that make licensing of industrial hemp farming 35 
contingent upon federal action and that requi re licensees to document the type of hemp 36 
planted and to provide notification of each sale. This Part also updates various provisions 37 
of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 7 and Title 22 that are affected by the enactment of 38 
the Cannabis Regulation Act and amends Title 26 to prohibit the employment of a person 39 
under 21 years of age in an establishment licensed for commercial cannabis -related 40 
activities.  41

 Part G provides that a person cannot be found to lack good moral character for 1 
personal, medical or commer cial marijuana activities allowed by this legislation when 2 
that person is applying to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun.  3 
Part H creates the Prevention and Control of Marijuana Use by Youth Program and 4 
its administering body, the Prevention and C ontrol of Marijuana Use by Youth Advisory 5 
Council.  The purpose of the program is to prevent persons under 21 years of age from 6 
using marijuana products.  Part H also creates the Cannabis Research Fund, which is 7 
established to conduct research on cannabis.  8
