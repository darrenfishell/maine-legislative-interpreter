 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, this legislation fosters economic growth in the State by providing 3 
incentives to film comp anies; and  4 
Whereas, film production is especially amenable to incentives because it is highly 5 
mobile, environmentally safe, capital and labor intensive and effective in promoting 6 
tourism; and  7 
Whereas, it is important that these incentives be made available  quickly to 8 
encourage film production companies to come to Maine as soon as possible, thus 9 
benefiting the economy and people of Maine; and  10 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 11 
the meaning of the Constitution o f Maine and require the following legislation as 12 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 13 
therefore,  14
