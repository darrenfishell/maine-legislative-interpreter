the denial, within 5 working days of the receipt of the request for inspection or co pying.  7 
A request for inspection or copying may be denied, in whole or in part, on the basis that 8

(3)  A description of the efforts made by the body, agency or official to inform 26 
the requesting party of the good faith estimate of costs and to discuss possible 27

B.  Any appeal that may be filed by the requesting party under section 409 may be 29 
consolidated with an action under this subsection.  30

limit or deny the request, the court  shall enter an order making such findings and 35 
establishing the terms upon which production, if any, must be made.  If the court 36 
finds that the body, agency or official has not demonstrated good cause to limit or 37 
deny the request, the court shall establish  a date by which the records must be 38 
provided to the requesting party.  39

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill amends the Freedom of Access Act to authorize a body, agency or official to 2 
deny a request for inspection or copying of public records, in whole or in part, on the 3 
basis that the request is unduly burdensome or oppressive.  The bill requires that the 4 
body, agency or official seek protection from an unduly burdensome or oppressive 5 
request by filing an action in Superior Court within 30 days of receipt of the request.  6 
This bill adopts a good cause standard to be used by the court in determining whether the 7 
request may be limited or denied as unduly burdensome or oppressive.  8
