Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of$16,500 per year in fiscal year 2015-16 and fiscal year 2016-17 to 
the Bureau of Labor Standards within the Department of Labor for the administrative costs associated with increasing 
the minimum wage. Ofthis amount, $3,500 per year is for updating the minimum wage poster and other related 
publications, $5,000 per year is related to postage costs to distribute the updated poster and publications to all 
employers in Maine and $~,OOO per year is for travel costs associated with compliance, education and outreach. 
The first step on the lowest salary rate schedule in State Government is $8.43 per hour. Currently there is no one 
being paid at that level. There are cunently 2 employees being paid $9.41 per hour. The 4-step increase in the 
minimum wage in the majority report will not increase salary costs to the State until the $9.50 per hour rate begins on 
October 1, 2018 and any impact would be negligible.
