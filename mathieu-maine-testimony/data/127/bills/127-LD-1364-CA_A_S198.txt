LD 1364 LR477(02) 
An Act To Expand Opportunities for Economic Development in Maine 
Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment 'A-" (S-Ig 8"") 
Committee: Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development 
Fiscal Detail and Notes Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential future biennium revenue decrease -General Fund 
Potential future biennium revenue decrease -Local Government Fund 
The bill makes changes to certain criteria used to qualify employees as Pine Tree Development Zone employees. 
Language in the bill requires income on a calendar year basis to be greater than income for the average weekly wage. 
Since annual income will always be greater than weekly income the new criteria for income does not eliminate anyone 
and would essentially remove the income requirements for certification and employee tax increment financing. This 
expansion of eligibility for certain Pine Tree Development Zone benefits could substantially decrease General Fund 
and Local Government Fund revenue beginning in fiscal year 2017-18. An estimate has not been made at this time.
