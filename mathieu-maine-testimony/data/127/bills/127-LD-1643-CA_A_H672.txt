10 SUMMARY 
11 This amendment amends the bill to designate the contents of the bill as Part A. 
12 This amendment deletes sections 31 and 51 and includes them in Part D with 
13 retroactive application. 
14 Section 6 of the bill is amended to correct the history. 
15 Section 25 of the bill is amended to make the law governing licensed assisted housing 
16 pro grams consistent with the laws governing disqualifying offenses for direct access 
17 personnel and direct care workers as provided in Public Law 2015, chapter 299. It makes 
18 a grammatical change from "must" to "shall" with regard to conducting comprehensive 
19 background checks. 
20 Section 40 of the bill is amended to retain cross-references in the Efficiency Maine 
21 Trust statutes to a repealed subsection, identifying the subsection as "former" to ensure 
22 that any funds collected under the former law are still available to be used as originally 
23 proposed. 
24 Section 47 is amended to correct the history. 
25 Part B contains additional technical corrections. Part B: 
26 1. Corrects a cross-reference to the definition of "tax expenditure" for the purposes 
27 of economic development proposals; 
28 2. Repeals Private and Special Law 2013, chapter 23 and enacts the Maine Revised 
29 Statutes, Title 30-A, section 4741, subsection 19 in order to correct the misallocation of 
30 the Maine State Housing Authority's designation as the entity to administer funds from 
31 the National Housing Trust Fund by the federal Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 
32 2008;and 
33 3. Corrects cross-references to the process for adjusting for inflation in the statute 
34 concerning modifications in the computation of taxable income of resident individuals.

36 when contingencies occur that affect the effective date or repeal of specific laws. Part C

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 1118, L.D. 1643 
1 1. MaineCare benefits suspension for fraud, to require a report if the relevant 
2 provisions of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are invalidated by 
3 the United States Supreme Court; 
4 2. Public Utilities Commission, to require a report when there are no funds 
5 remaining in the Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Trust Fund; 
6 3. Tri-State Lotto, to require a report if the other Tri-State Lotto states have agreed to 
7 limit the pool of numbers; 
8 4. Tri-State Lotto, to require a report if the United States Internal Revenue Service or 
9 a court has determined that there are disadvantageous tax implications for prize winners 
10 who do not use the periodic payments as collateral; 
11 5. State tax on net operating revenue of hospitals, to require a report of a 
12 determination that the tax is not a permissible health care related tax or that all or part of 
13 the hospital payments made from the tax are disapproved hospital reimbursements under 
14 the State's Medicaid program; 
15 6. Finance Authority of Maine, to require a report that the contingency for increased 
16 loan insurance has been met; and 
17 7. Finance Authority of Maine, to require a report that the contingency allowing an 
18 increased Economic Recovery Program loan amount has been met. 
19 Part D contains changes that are or may be considered substantive. Part D: 
20 1. Corrects a clerical error that used the term "key employee" when the appropriate 
21 term is "key executive" with regard to a person applying for a license from the Gambling 
22 Control Board; 
23 2. Corrects a conflict created by Public Law 2015, chapters 90, 127, 136, 245, 281 
24 and 301, which affected the same subsection of law governing hunting licenses, 
25 combination licenses and fees, by incorporating the changes made by all 6 laws and 
26 corrects an inconsistency created by Public Law 2015, chapter 127, which removed the 
27 prohibition against hunting turkey by holders of small game licenses but not against 
28 holders of nonresident small game apprenticeship hunter licenses and nonresident 3-day 
29 small game hunting licenses. It also corrects a clerical error; 
30 3. Corrects an inconsistency concerning the specific laws governing disqualifying 
31 offenses for an unlicensed assistive person who provides direct access services. The 
32 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 1812-J, subsection 7 provides that an 
33 employment ban based on a disqualifying offense for an unlicensed assistive person to 
34 provide direct access services is a lifetime ban. Title 22, section 9054 provides a process 
35 for an unlicensed assistive person who is banned from employment because of a 
36 disqualifying offense to request a waiver. Section 3 of this Part corrects this 
37 inconsistency by removing the language in Title 22, section 1812-J, subsection 7 that 
38 states that an employment ban based on a disqualifying offense is a lifetime employment 
39 ban; 
40 4. Removes youth camps from a list of facilities exempted from the laws requiring 
41 licensure because youth camps are required to be licensed as youth camps, although they 
42 are not required to be licensed as lodging places. It also corrects a clerical error;

2 elder and adult services to remove references to the Director of the Bureau of Elder and 
3 Adult Services, a defunct position, and replaces them with references to the 
4 Commissioner of Health and Human Services; 
5 6. Restores language concerning a Class A restaurant and off-premises retail licensee 
6 on the same premises that was repealed by its own terms before the enactment of the law 
7 to eliminate the repeal took effect. Public Law 2015, chapter 162 amended Title 28-A, 
8 section 10, subsection 2-A to remove language repealing subsection 2-A on September 
9 30, 2015. Public Law 2015, chapter 162 did not take effect until October 15, 2015, after 
10 the repeal took effect. Section 9 of Part D enacts Title 28-A, section 10, subsection 2-B 
11 to reflect the intent of the Legislature to maintain the provisions of Title 28-A, section 10, 
12 subsection 2-A. This was included as section 31 of the bill. Section 10 of Part D makes 
13 that enactment apply retroactively to September 30, 2015; and 
14 8. Corrects clerical errors in Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part 0000, section 7 
15 concerning the application date of sales tax exemptions. This was included as section 51 
16 of the bill. Section 12 of Part D makes the corrections apply retroactively to June 30, 
17 2015, the effective date of Public Law 2015, chapter 267.
