This bill repeals the authority of municipalities to issue concealed weapons permits and increases the permit term 
from 4 to 10 years. In the 1st Regular Session of the 127th Legislature, PL 2015, Chapter 327 eliminated the general 
permitting requirement for concealed weapons with certain exceptions. Before that change reduced the number of 
permits issued by the State and by municipalities, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) had estimated the need for 6 
additional positions to take on the permitting responsibilities of municipalities as required by this bill. Although it is 
not known how many permits municipalities currently issue, with fewer permits being issued by municipalities now 
because of the statutory change last year, the bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of$253,814 to 
the DPS for one Office Associate II position, one State Police Detective position and related administrative costs to 
issue permits currently issued by municipalities. 
Any permit application fees that currently go to municipalities will now go to the DPS as Other Special Revenue 
Funds revenue. No estimate is made of the amount ofrevenue that will be received by the DPS. If the fee revenue is 
not sufficient to fund the additional allocation, the DPS will need to seek a General Fund appropriation in a 
subsequent budget to fully fund the positions.
