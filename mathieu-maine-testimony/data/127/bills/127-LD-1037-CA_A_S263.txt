13 Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and supplemental security income 
14 and the general assistance program. It does not apply to benefits that include federal 
15 funding. A victim of domestic violence is not subject to the 180-day residency 
16 requirement.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill may produce savings to the Department of Health and Human Services. As the department does not have the 
data necessary to determine how many individuals may not meet the 180-day residency requirement and thus not be 
eligible to receive a state-funded assistance program, no estimate of savings is made.
