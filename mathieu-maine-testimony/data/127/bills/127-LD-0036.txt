 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA ยง664, sub-ยง1, as amended by PL 2007, c. 640, ยง4, is further 2

October 1, 2016, the minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour.  Starting October 1, 2017 9 
and each October 1st thereafter, if there is an increase in the Consumer Price Index as of 10 
June 30th of that year from the Consumer Price Index as of June 30th of the preceding 11 
year, the minimum hourly wage in effect at that time must be increased by the same 12 
percentage as the Consumer Price Index increase.  For purposes of this subsection, 13

Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or successor index, as published by 15 
the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.   If the highest federal 16

same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, but in no case may the minimum 19 
wage exceed the minimum wage otherwise in effect under this section by more than $1 20 
per hour. 21

This bill raises the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour beginning October 1, 2015 and 23 
to $10.00 per hour beginning October 1, 2016 and provides that, beginning October 1 , 24 
2017, the minimum wage must be adjusted for inflation on October 1st of each year. 25
