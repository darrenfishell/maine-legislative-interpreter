127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 863, L.D. 1263, Bill, "An Act To 
Create Jobs and Promote Investment in Maine's Economy through Increased Access to 
Solar Energy" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Create Sustainable Growth in Maine's Distributed Energy Sector That 
Uses Market Forces To Fairly Compensate Energy Producers' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inselting the following: 
'Preamble. Whereas, the Legislature finds that net energy billing is a simple 
mechanism that has supported the development of distributed generation in Maine, but 
net energy billing may not provide a suitable long-tetm foundation for distributed 
generation; and 
Whereas, the Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to develop an 
alternative to net energy billing that fairly and transparently allocates the costs and 
benefits of distributed generation to all customers, allows participation by all customers 
and creates a sustainable platform for future growth of distributed generation to the 
benefit of all ratepayers; and 
Whereas, the Legislature finds that the policy structure described within the Office 
of the Public Advocate's white paper entitled "A Ratepayer Focused Strategy for 
Distributed Solar in Maine" merits further exploration; now, therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Stakeholder discussions. Resolved: That the Public Utilities 
Commission shall, using existing resources, convene a stakeholder group to develop an 
alternative to net energy billing, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, 
section 3209-A. To the maximum extent possible, the recommendations from this group 
must reflect consensus among the stakeholders. In developing an alternative, the 
commission shall:

1. Ensure the alternative includes fixed, long-tenn compensation mechanisms for 
distributed generation that, when feasible, obtain the best price for ratepayers using 
market-based competition or capacity-based step downs, as described in the Office of the 
Public Advocate's white paper entitled "A Ratepayer Focused Strategy for Distributed 
Solar in Maine," and ensure the maximum level of compensation for a given technology 
does not exceed the ratepayer benefits as determined by a commission evaluation of the 
specific benefits of that technology; 
2. Develop at least 3 aggregate market size scenarios representing low, medium and 
high estimates of the total installed capacity that would be developed under existing rate 
structures if net energy billing were to continue through 2021; 
3. Ensure the alternative provides opportunities for meaningful participation by all 
market segments identified in the Office of the Public Advocate's white paper, including 
residential, commercial, industrial, community and wholesale or grid-scale solar 
distributed generation; 
4. Include a method to aggregate, capture and monetize for ratepayers the benefits of 
distributed generation assets, including, but not limited to, benefits related to energy 
supply, capacity and renewable energy credits, in order to maximize revenues for 
aggregation to all ratepayers and identify the appropriate entity to initially serve as an 
aggregator, while providing for the opportunity for 3rd-party aggregation at a future date; 
and 
5. Develop a process and timeline for transition from current net energy billing 
policies to the alternative that address the following: 
A. The continued availability of net energy billing pending an assessment of the 
alternative, or until such date as the commission may recommend; 
B. Options for participation by existing net energy billing customers in the 
alternative; and 
C. Continuing opportunities for self-consumption by distributed generation 
customers once the alternative is fully implemented; and be it further 
Sec. 2. Report. Resolved: That the Public Utilities Commission shall submit a 
report to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology by January 
30, 2016 that includes an overview of the stakeholder discussions; an overview of the 
alternative under section 1; any areas in which stakeholders were unable to reach 
consensus; technical specifications, rules or policies needed to carry out the alternative; a 
proposed timeline for implementation of the alternative; technical or legal bal1'iers to 
implementation of the alternative; and any other recommendations. The committee may 
report out a bill to the Second Regular Session of the l27th Legislature related to the 
report. '
