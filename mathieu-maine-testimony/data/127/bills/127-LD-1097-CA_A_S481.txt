13 This amendment is the majority report of the committee. Like the bill, the 
14 amendment prohibits the expenditure of benefits received by recipients under the 
15 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, using the electronic benefits transfer 
16 system, for products or services such as tobacco products, liquor and lottery tickets. The 
17 amendment requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a system 
18 to prevent the use of the electronic benefits transfer system for such purchases by 
19 blocking the purchases at the point of sale. It establishes penalties for violations. It 
20 requires the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to create an implementation 
21 committee to determine the most effective system to prevent prohibited expenditures at 
22 the point of sale. It directs the implementation committee to report to the joint standing 
23 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters 
24 no later than December 15, 2016. The implementation committee report may include any 
25 legislation necessary to implement the system.

This bill includes a General Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services of $500,000 in 
fiscal year 2016-17 to restrict use of benefits on the electronic benefits card (EBT) by recipients of temporary 
assistance for needy families on specific items and activities by blocking prohibited purchases through electronic 
means and to create a committee to determine feasible options for restricitng use of the EBT card on prohibited items. 
The committee will determine the cost of this system on the State and on businesses. The bill also includes an Other 
Special Revenue Funds allocation of 516,135 and a Federal Block Grant Fund allocation of 115,739 in fiscal year 
2016-17. 
Any savings achieved by prohibiting certain purchases and activities would likely not accrue to the General Fund due 
to the Maintenance of Effort spending required of the State to receive the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
Federal Block Grant funds. 
Any additional costs to the Department of the Attorney General are expected to be minor.
