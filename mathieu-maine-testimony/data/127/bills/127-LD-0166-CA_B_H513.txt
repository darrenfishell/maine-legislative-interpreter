1 SUMMARY 
2 This amendment replaces the substance of the bill, which applies only to York 
3 County. It changes the title and removes language in current law that provides that a 
4 county may provide rescue services through the sheriffs department and deputies and 
5 instead provides that each county may provide rescue services to the entire county, 
6 omitting municipalities that ask to be excluded, or by municipal-county contracts to 
7 municipalities that enter into contracts as long as county tax revenues are not used to 
8 support the services. It also makes minor nonsubstantive technical changes to reflect 
9 current usage.
