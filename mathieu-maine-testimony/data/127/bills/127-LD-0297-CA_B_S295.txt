J. "Qualified low-income community investment" means any capital or equity 
investment in, or loan to, any qualified active low-income community business made 
after September 28, 2011, as long as no more than 5% of such investment is used to 
refinance costs, expenses or investments incurred or paid by the qualified active low­
income community business, or a related party, prior to the date of the qualified low­
income community investment; make equity distributions from the qualified active 
low-income community business to its owners; or acquire an existing Maine business 
or enterprise. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, with respect to anyone 
qualified active low-income community business, the maximum amount of qualified 
low-income community investments that may be made with the proceeds of qualified 
equity investments that have been certified under Title 10, section 11 OO-Z, subsection 
3, paragraph G is $10,000,000 per project constructed, maintained or operated by the 
qualified active low-income community business whether made by one or several 
qualified community development entities. With respect to investments in a qualified 
active low-income community business that is a manufacturing or value-added 
production enterprise, the limit on the qualified low-income community investment is 
$40,000,000 per project constructed, maintained or operated by the qualified active 
low-income community business. For the purposes of this paragraph, with respect to 
projects to which the $10,000,000 limitation applies, "project" includes all land, 
buildings, structures, machinery and equipment located at the same location and 
constructed, maintained or operated by the qualified active low-income community 
business. For the purposes of this paragraph, with respect to projects to which the 
$40,000,000 limitation applies, "project" means, and refers separately to, each 
manufacturing or value-added production facility that projects to create or retain 
more than 200 jobs, including the land, buildings, structures, machinery and 
equipment functionally related to, and integrated with, the manufacturing or 
production process conducted on the site of that facility. "Project" does not mean or 
include the component pieces of an integrated manufacturing or production process 
conducted on the site of a particular facility. 
Sec. 5. Application. That section of this Act that amends the Maine Revised 
Statutes, Title 36, section 5219-HH, subsection 1, paragraph J applies only to applications 
received after the effective date of this Act by the Finance Authority of Maine for the 
Maine New Markets Capital Investment Program, pursuant to Title 10, section 1100-Z, 
for certification of a qualified equity investment pursuant to Title 10, section 1100-Z, 
subsection 3, paragraph G.'
