served to enhance the sentencing class.  13 
SUMMARY  14 
This bill implements the recommendations of the Criminal Law Advisory 15 
Commission to make amendments to the Maine Criminal Code and related statutes .  16 
Specifically, the bill:  17 
1.  Amends the law on prohibited possession of firearms to remove a redundant 18 
reference in the case of a deferred disposition;  19 
2.  Amends the law on prohibited possession of firearms as a result of a domestic 20 
violence offense to add termination of the 5 -year prohibition period if at the conclusion of 21 
a deferred disposition period the court grants the State's motion to allow a person to 22 
withdraw the plea and the State dismisses the pending charging instrument with 23 
prejudice;  24 
3.  Ad ds penalties for possession of a firearm by a person designated as prohibited 25 
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 393, subsection 1, paragraphs F 26 
to J and subsection 1 -B.  These prohibition provisions were added by Public Law 2015, 27 
chapter 287, sections 3 and 5, but penalties for violations of them were not enacted.  This 28 
bill makes a violation of paragraphs F to J a Class D crime.  It makes a violation of 29 
subsection 1 -B by a person at least 18 years of age a Class C crime;  30 
4.  Enacts a definition of "administration of juvenile justice" in Title 15, chapter 102 31 
regarding the interception of wire and oral communications that is consistent with the 32 
Maine Juvenile Code;  33 
5.  Amends the definition of "administration of criminal justice" as u sed in certain 34 
laws regarding the interception of wire and oral communications by including under 35 
administration of criminal justice activities under the Intelligence and Investigative 36 
Record Information Act;  37 
6.  Amends the Class C sentencing provision for  a person convicted of stalking who 38 
has one or more prior convictions to clarify that although the court continues to have 39 
discretion to impose any other authorized sentencing alternative, the court is required to 40 
impose a sentencing alternative that inclu des a term of imprisonment of at least one year;  41 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR2588(01) -1 
 7.  Amends the Class B sentencing provision for a person convicted of stalking who 1 
has one or more prior convictions, at least one of which was for stalking 2 or more 2 
specific persons that are members of an identifiable group, to require the court in 3 
determining the basic term of imprisonment as the first step in the sentencing process to 4 
select a term of at least 2 years; and  5 
8.  Strikes redundant provisions requiring the court, in imposing a sentencing 6 
alternative for the crime of stalking, to consider whether the victim was being stalked by 7 
the person being sentenced.  8 
Current law provides that for the purpose of imposing a sentence for certain crimes, if 9 
the defendant has 2 or more convictions for those cri mes, the sentencing class for the 10 
crime is one class higher.  This bill provides that an attempt to commit such crimes also 11 
results in a higher sentencing class.  12
