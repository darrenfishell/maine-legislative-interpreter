Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
The bill requires that general obligation bonds ratified by the legal voters of the State be issued unless one or more of 
5 specific conditions exist. The bill also removes the requirement that such bonds bear the facsimile of the signature 
of the Governor. The new provisions apply to existing authorized but unissl,led bonds as well as to all bonds that may 
be authorized by the voters in the future. The bill may provide a higher degree of assurance that the nonnal process for 
issuing bonds will proceed once the voters have approved. No additional costs will be created by this bill other than 
the ordinary debt serviCe anticipated at the time the bonds were, or will be, sent to the voters.
