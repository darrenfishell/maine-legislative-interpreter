 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the 90 -day period likely will not terminate until after the season for 3 
reconstructing and repairing roads has ended; and  4 
Whereas, Orchard Hills Parkway, a private roadway in the City of Bangor, serves 2 5 
residential developments, the Orchard Hills Homeowners Association, consisting of 101 6 
residential units, and the Cortland Circle Homeowners Ass ociation, consisting of 51 7 
residential units; and  8 
Whereas, the Orchard Hills Parkway was constructed in 1985 for the common use 9 
of the residents of both of the developments; and  10 
Whereas, the developers incorporated a nonprofit corporation under the laws of  the 11 
State known as the Orchard Hills Umbrella Association as a road association to hold title 12 
to and to manage and maintain the Orchard Hills Parkway and related common areas; and  13 
Whereas, the Orchard Hills Umbrella Association failed to file its annual r eport and 14 
was administratively suspended by the Secretary of State in 1989; and  15 
Whereas, the Orchard Hills Parkway has grossly deteriorated and needs to be fully 16 
reconstructed during the next construction season before the road completely fails; and  17 
Wherea s, the Orchard Hills Umbrella Association needs to be reinstated as a 18 
nonprofit corporation by an act of the Legislature; and  19 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 20 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and r equire the following legislation as 21 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 22 
therefore,  23 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  24 
Sec. 1.  Reinstatement of Orchard Hills Umbrella Associatio n.   25

subsection 31 for 2015, any fees or penalties associated with this reinstatement are 30 
waived.  31
