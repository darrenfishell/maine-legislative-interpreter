The bill allows milk producers selling not pasteurized milk or mille products to be exempt from licensing if the sale is 
conducted in a celiain mamler, the producer completes a course in dairy sanitation and the producer samples their 
source water. There will.be an estimated General Fund revenue reduction of $1,875 in fiscal year 2015-16 and of 
$2,500 annually in subsequent fiscal years from fewer sales of milk distributor licenses. The Depmiment of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has indicated that a Consumer Protection Inspector position is necessary for 
the enhanced inspection process required by the exemption criteria. As no funding or position is provided in the bill, 
any impact on other services or programs cannot be determined at this time.
