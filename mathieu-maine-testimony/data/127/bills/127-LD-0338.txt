 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA ยง6202, sub -ยง3 is enacted to read:  2 
3.  Preparatory education testing.  The department in consultation with the state 3 
board shall establish a statewide assessment program to mea sure and evaluate the 4 
academic achievements of students in grade 10 for purposes of determining preparedness 5 
for postsecondary education.  This assessment applies to all students attending public 6 
secondary schools, public charter schools, as defined in sec tion 2401, subsection 9, and 7 
private schools approved for tuition that enroll at least 60% publicly funded students, as 8 
determined by the previous school year's October and April average enrollment.  Costs 9 
relating to the assessment program established und er this subsection must be paid by the 10 
department; however, the department shall ensure that the assessment is available to a 11 
student to retake, at the student's own expense, prior to June 1st of every year.  12 
A.  The assessment program must be designed to p rovide data in the areas of reading 13 
comprehension, writing and mathematics, at a minimum, and must be sufficient to 14 
allow the Maine Community College System to determine whether a student would 15 
be required to enroll in remedial coursework in those areas in  the Maine Community 16 
College System.  17 
B.  If a student does not achieve at least the score in a specific subject area tested, as 18 
determined under section 12709, subsection 10 -A, and is accepted at and enrolls in a 19 
college within the Maine Community College System, the college shall pay the costs 20 
of all remedial coursework the student may be required to complete in that specific 21 
subject area in pursuit of the student's course of study declared at matriculation.  22 
Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA ยง12709, sub -ยง10-A is enacted to read:  23 
10-A.  Admissions.  To determine admissions criteria for each of the colleges within 24 
the system, including annually determining the scores a student who has completed the 25 
assessment program established under section 6202, subsection 3 must achieve  in each of 26 
the specific subject areas tested under section 6202, subsection 3, to conclusively indicate 27 
that the student is qualified for college -level work in the system and will not need to 28 
enroll in remedial coursework while attending a college within the system;  29 
SUMMARY  30 
This bill requires that all students in grade 10 in a public school, public charter school 31 
or private school approved for tuition that enrolls at least 60% publicly funded students 32 
complete an academic achievement assessment established  by the Department of 33 
Education and the State Board of Education.  The President of the Maine Community 34 
College System must determine the scores on the assessment that conclusively indicate 35 
that a student will not need to enroll in remedial coursework whil e attending a college 36 
within the system.  If a student whose score indicates that remedial coursework is 37 
required is accepted at and enrolls in a college within the system, the college must pay the 38 
costs of any remedial coursework the student may need to c omplete in the course of study 39 
declared at matriculation.  40
