The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
If the constitutional amendment were to be approved by the voters, landowners with 25 acres or less could opt out of 
the tree growth program with no penalty. Currently, a penalty equal to S years of property taxes that would have been 
paid ifnot in the tree growth program less taxes paid would be assessed by the municipal tax assessor or the state tax 
assessor in the case of unorganized territories. Once a landowner has opted out, the land would be subject to the full 
property tax assessment.
