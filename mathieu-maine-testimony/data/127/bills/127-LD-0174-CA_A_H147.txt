Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill prohibits, during celiain date ranges, Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) candidates from establishing a 
political action committee (PAC) for which they are a treasurer, principal officer or primarily responsible for 
fundraising or decision making. The amount of savings will depend on the number ofMCEA eligible candidates who 
choose to establish these PACs. Based on 2014 MCEA payments from the Maine Clean Election Fund there would 
have been an approximate savings of$4,910 and $22,705 for each MCEA certified candidate for State Representative 
and State Senator, respectively, that chose not to hecome MCEA certified. No estimate is made at this time of the 
number of candidates that might forego MCEA certification to establish these PACs moving forward.
