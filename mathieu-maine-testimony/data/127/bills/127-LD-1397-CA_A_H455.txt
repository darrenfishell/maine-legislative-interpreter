The bill establishes the Affordable Heating from Maine's Forests Fund (Heating Fund) within the Efficiency Maine 
Trust (EMT). The bill requires the Public Reserved Lands Management Fund within the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to transfer at least $1,000,000 on July 1,2015 to the Heating Fund and also requires 
a transfer, on July 1,2015 and annually, of any revenue credited in the Public Reserved Lands Management Fund over 
the 2012 revenue amounts to be transferred to the Heating Fund, barring certain circumstances. This fiscal note 
assumes that "over the 2012 revenue amounts" means fiscal year 2012. The Public Reserved Lands Management Fund 
will transfer an estimated $3,546,817 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $1,721,348 in fiscal year 2016-17 and in subsequent 
years. The bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of$3,546,817 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $1,721,348 
in fiscal year 2016-17 for investments in measures reducing residential heating costs. Any additional costs to EMT to 
implement this legislation are expected to be minor.
