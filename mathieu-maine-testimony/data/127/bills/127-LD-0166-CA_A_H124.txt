'An Act To Allow Counties To Better Provide Rescue and Ambulance Services' 
Amend the bill in section 1 in ยง456 by striking out all of the indented paragraph

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee and replaces the substance of 
the bill, which applies only to York County. It changes the title and removes language in 
current law that provides that a county may provide rescue services through the sheriffs 
department and deputies and instead provides that each county may provide rescue 
services.
