Fiscal Note 
Current biennium revenue decrease -Broadband Sustainability Fund 
The bill eliminates the broadband sustainability fee and requires funds in the Broadband Sustainability Fund (BSF) 
within the ConnectME Authority (ConnectME) to be used to support and promote broadband service in unserved or 
underserved areas. ConnectME is a legally separate entity from the State and is a component unit of the State that is, 
not funded using state funds. Under current law, 95% of the funds from this fee go to the BSF and 5% go to the ' 
ConnectME Fund. Eliminating the broadband sustainability fee will reduce revenue to the two funds at ConnectME 
by an estimated $350,000 in fiscal year 2015-16, $900,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 and $750,000 in fiscal year 2017-18. 
Under current law, this fee will end on December 31, 2017. There is currently $343,728 in the BSF, but ConnectME 
has indicated that the BSF will have a substantially smaller balance before this bill becomes law due to certain 
companies requesting disbursements from the BSF as allowed under current law. There is a Superior Court case 
pending concerning delinquent broadband sustainability fee payments owed to ConnectME. ConnectME estimates a 
$320,000 judgment if ConnectME prevails in the court case. This $320,000 would not be disbursed to certain 
companies if the case is resolved after the bill becomes law and that additional revenue could potentially be available 
to support and promote broadband service in unserved or underserved areas.
