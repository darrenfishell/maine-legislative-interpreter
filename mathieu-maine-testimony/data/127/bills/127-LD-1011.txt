pertinent rules and regulations for employers conducting substance abuse testing.  The 30 
model policy must be posted on the bureau's publicly acc essible website.   Before 31 
establishing any substance abuse testing program, an employer must develop or, as 32 
required in section 684, subsection 3, paragraph C, must appoint an employee committee 33 
to develop a written policy in compliance with this subchapter  providing  adopt the model 34

 Page 2 - 127LR1331( 01)-1 
 department shall treat all employers that adopt the model policy as having the same 1 
substance abuse testing policy.  The model policy must provid e for, at a minimum:  2 
A.  The procedure and consequences of an employee's voluntary admission of a 3 
substance abuse problem and any available assistance , including the availability and 4 
procedure of the employer's employee assistance program ; 5

conducted in a medical facility and supervised by a licensed physician or nurse.  16 
A medical facility includes a first aid station located at the work site.  17 
(2)  An  employer may not require an employee or applicant to remove any 18 
clothing for the purpose of collecting a urine sample, except that:  19 
(a)  An employer may require that an employee or applicant leave any 20 
personal belongings other than clothing and any unnece ssary coat, jacket or 21 
similar outer garments outside the collection area; or  22 
(b)  If it is the standard practice of an off -site medical facility to require the 23 
removal of clothing when collecting a urine sample for any purpose, the 24 
physician or nurse super vising the collection of the sample in that facility 25 
may require the employee or applicant to remove their the employee's or the 26 
applicant's  clothing.  27 
(3)  No employee or applicant may be required to provide a urine sample while 28 
being observed, directly or  indirectly, by another individual.  29

a urine sample if the sample collector or testing laboratory determines that the 31 
sample may have been substituted, adulterated, diluted o r otherwise tampered 32 
with in an attempt to influence test results.  The Department of Health and 33 
Human Services shall adopt rules governing when those additional actions are 34 
justified and the scope of those actions.  These rules may not permit the direct o r 35 
indirect observation of the collection of a urine sample.  If an employee or 36 
applicant is found to have twice substituted, adulterated, diluted or otherwise 37 
tampered with the employee's or applicant's urine sample, as determined under 38 
the rules adopted b y the department, the employee or applicant is deemed to have 39

section 687 regulating screening and confirmation cutoff levels for other 20 
substances of abuse, including those substances tested for in blood samples under 21 
subsection 5, paragraph B, to ensure that levels are set within known toleranc es 22 
of test methods and above mere trace amounts.  An employer may request that 23 
the Department of Health and Human Services establish a cutoff level for any 24 
substance of abuse for which the department has not established a cutoff level.  25 
(3)  Notwithstanding  subparagraphs (1) and (2), if the Department of Health and 26 
Human Services does not have established cutoff levels or procedures for any 27

portion of a substance abuse testing policy under this subsection that relates to the 2 
employees.  The employer is not required to consult with the employees on those portions 3 
of a policy that relate only to applicants.  The employer shall send a copy of the final 4 
written policy to the Department of Labor for review under section 686.  The employer 5 
may not implement the policy until the Department of Labor approves the policy.  The 6 
employer shall send a copy of any proposed change in an approved written policy to th e 7 
Department of Labor for review under section 686.  The employer may not implement the 8

effect.  The employer shall provide each employee with a copy of any change in a w ritten 17 
policy approved by the Department of Labor under section 686 at least 60 days before 18 
any portion of the change applicable to employees takes effect.  The Department of Labor 19 
may waive the 60 -day notice for the implementation of an amendment covering  20 
employees if the amendment was necessary to comply with the law or if, in the judgment 21 
of the department, the amendment promotes the purpose of the law and does not lessen 22 
the protection of an individual employee.   If an employer intends to test an applic ant, the 23 
employer shall provide  inform  the applicant with a copy of the written policy under 24 
subsection 2 before administering a substance abuse test to the applicant.  The 30 -day and 25

employee's previous job with full pay and benefits unless conditions unrelated to 29 
the employee's previous confirmed positive result make the employee's return 30 
impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must may not conflict with any 31 
provision of a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and a labor 32 
organization that is the collective bargaining representative of the unit of which 33 
the employee is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or tre atment provider 34

may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement 11 
between the employer and a labor organization that is the collective 12 
bargaining representative of the unit of which the employee is or would be a 13 
part. 14 
(b)  Notwithstanding div ision (a), if an employee who has successfully 15 
completed rehabilitation is medically disqualified, the employer is not 16 
required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 17 
during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not req uired to 18

 Page 9 - 127LR1331(01) -1 
 of medical marijuana use in the workplace, including what steps the State recommends 1 
for an employer to take if an employee tests positive for marijuana use.  By December 2, 2 
2015, the Department of Labor shall submit its report detailing the marijuana wor kplace 3 
policy along with any recommended legislation to the Joint Standing Committee on 4 
Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development.  The Joint Standing 5

bill based upon the  report to the Second Regular Session of the 127th Legislature.  7 
SUMMARY  8 
Current law requires employers that want to provide a drug -free workplace by testing 9 
applicants or employees for substance abuse to develop and file a policy with the 10 
Department of Lab or.  The Bureau of Labor Standards reviews the policies to ensure 11 
compliance with state laws and rules.  This bill provides employers with a single, 12 
consistent model policy.  The model policy, which must be established by the 13 
Commissioner of Labor and mana ged by the department, is intended to encourage greater 14 
participation by employers to reduce substance abuse in the workplace.  The bill requires 15 
an employer to adopt the model policy before establishing a substance abuse testing 16 
program.  It removes the r equirements that employers provide an employee assistance 17 
program and pay for half of rehabilitation beyond services provided through health care 18 
benefits.  Employers may offer an employee assistance program if they choose.  The bill 19 
amends the definition of "probable cause" to provide that a single work -related accident is 20 
probable cause to suspect an employee is under the influence of a substance of abuse.  21
