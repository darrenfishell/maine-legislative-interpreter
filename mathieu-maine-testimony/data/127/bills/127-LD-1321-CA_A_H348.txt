Minor revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
The bill requires the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW) to establish a Keep Maine Clean program that 
recruits volunteers to pick up trash. Costs to run this program are expected to be minor and the Landowner Relations 
Fund within IFW will fund this program and has sufficient funds to absorb these costs. This bill also allows IFW to 
accept donations to this new program and directs these donations to the Landowner Relations Fund. Any expected 
revenue from donations are expected to be minor. This bill also changes the composition of the Landowners and 
Sportsmen Relations Advisory Board, has the IFW commissioner, rather than the Governor, fill vacancies and 
requires the board to issue an annual report. Any additional costs to IFW to make these changes are expected to be 
minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
