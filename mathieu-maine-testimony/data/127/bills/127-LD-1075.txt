SUMMARY  4 
This bill amends the Canton Water District charter.  It adds language allowing the 5 
district to contract out work, changes provisions governing the scheduling of the annual 6 
meeting of the board of trustees in order to increase flexibility and changes the provisions 7 
regarding compensation of trustees to have the trustees recommend and the municipal 8 
officers of the Town of Canton approve compensation amounts.  It removes langua ge 9 
allowing the trustees to include their annual report in the town report.  It changes a 10 
quorum at annual and special meetings of the board of trustees from 5% to a majority of 11 
those present and narrows voting at those meetings from residents of the distr ict to 12 
customers residing in the district.  It also establishes readiness -to-serve charges, allows 13 
the district to invest in mutual funds and establishes liens for unpaid rates.  14
