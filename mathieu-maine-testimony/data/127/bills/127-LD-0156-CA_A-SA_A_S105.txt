Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment removes the elimination of the minimum age requirement to obtain ajunior hunting license that was 
included in the committee amendment and keeps the minimum age at 10 years old to obtain this license. This reverses 
the estimated $27,875 annual increase in General Fund revenue from allowing children younger than 10 to be eligible 
for ajunior hunting license. The amendment also removes the estimated $25,445 annual increase in Federal 
Expenditures Fund revenue that the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife expected to receive from federal 
grants that are based on hunting licenses sold.
