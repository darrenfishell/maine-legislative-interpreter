Sec. 1.  33 MRSA §1953, sub -§1, ¶E, as amended by PL 2003, c. 20, Pt. T, §20, 2 
is further amended to read:  3

of the last indication by the owner of interest in the property.  In the case of certain 5 
types of deposits, the following rules apply:  6 
(1)  In the case of a time deposit that is automatically renewable and whose term 7 
is longer than one year, at the date of maturity following the 5th renewal of the 8 
deposit after the last indication of interest by the owner; and  9

This paragraph does not apply to prearranged funeral or burial plans described in 13 
Title 32, section 1401;  14 
SUMMARY  15 
The purpose of this bill is to clarify that the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act does 16 
not presume the fu nds held by a financial institution for a prearranged funeral or burial 17 
plan are presumed abandoned until 3 years after the death of the person on whose behalf 18 
funds were paid into the plan.  The bill amends the provision establishing the presumptive 19 
aband onment of demand, savings and time deposit accounts to specifically state that it 20 
does not apply to prearranged funeral and burial plans.  Those plans are explicitly 21 
covered by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 33, section 1953, subsection 1, paragraph P.  22
