Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation repeals the provision of law that licensure of industrial hemp is contingent upon action by the Federal 
Government. The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of$42,697 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$39,911 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) for one half-time 
Certified Seed Specialist position and related costs to conduct testing, inspection and monitoring, as well as 
rulemaking costs to establish fees. Applicants will pay an application fee between $50 and $100, a license fee between 
$100 and $500 and a fee for monitoring, sampling and testing between $1 per acre and $100 per acre. 
This fiscal note assumes that there will be an adequate amount of revenue to cover the costs of the Other Special 
Revenue Funds allocations. DACF will not be able to cover these costs ifthere are not a sufficient number of fee­
paying applicants.
