and 
Whereas, a public charter school is not required to reimburse the school 
administrative unit in which the student reside s if a public charter school student returns

Whereas, it is necessary that this Act take ef fect before the start of the 2015-2016

Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §2413, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 272, §2, is 
further am
ended to read: 
A.  For each public charter school student, the school administrative unit in which the 
student resides 
must forward the per-pupil allocation to the public charter school 
attended by the student as follows. 
(1)  The per-pupil allocation amount is the EPS per-pupil rate for the school ad
ministrative unit in which the student r esides, as calculated pursuant to section 
15676, based on the student’s grade level and adjusted as appropriate for 
economic disadvantage and limited Englis h proficiency pursuant to section 
15675, subsections 1 and 2.  Debt service and capital outlays may not be included 
in the calculation of these per-pupil allocati ons.  The department shall adopt rules 
governing how to calculate these per-pupil allocations, including those for 
targeted funds for assessment technology and kindergarten to grade 2 programs. 
(2)  For students attending public charter schools, the school administrative unit of residence shall forward the per-pupil allocations described in su
bparagraph (1) 
directly to the public charter school attended.  These per-pupil allocations must 
be forwarded to each public charter school on a quarterly basis, as follows.  For 
each fiscal year, allocations must be made in quarterly payments on September 1st, December 1st, March 1st and June  1st.  The September and December 
payments must be based on the identity and number of students enrolled or 
anticipated to be enrolled in the public charter school at the opening of school for that school year. The number of students may not exceed the maximum 
enrollment approved in the charter contr act for that year unless a waiver is 
obtained from the authorizer.   The Marc h and June payments must be based on

14 (3)  For transportation expenses, the average per-pupil expense in each scho
 ol 
administrative unit of residence must be calculated and an amount equal to a proportion, up to but not more than 100%, of that per-pupil allocation amount 
must be forwarded to the public charte r school attended on the same basis as the 
per-pupil allocations for operating funds.  The percentage of that per-pupil 
expense must be determined by the aut horizer of the public charter school and 
must be based on the cost of transportation services provided by the public 
charter school to the student. 
(4)  The department shall pay to the public charter school any additional 
allocation assigned to t
he public charter school for gifted and talented students 
pursuant to section 15681-A, subsection 5 in  the year in which the allocation is 
assigned. 
A school administrative unit is not  required to send funds to a public charter school 15 
for a student enrolled in the public charte r school's preschool or prekindergarten 16 
program if the school administrative unit of the student's residence does not offer that 17 
program to its own residents.  18 
19 Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §2413, sub-§2, ¶¶A-1 and A-2 are enacted to read: 
A-1.  A school administrative unit is not required to send funds to a public charter 20 
school for a student enrolled in the public charter school's preschool or 21 
prekindergarten program if the school administrative unit of the student's residence 22 
does not offer that program to its own residents.  23 
A-2.  When a student attends a public charter school for a portion of a school year 24 
and attends the school administrative unit of the student's residence for another 25 
portion of that school year, the public charter school to which the per-pupil 26 
allocations are made pursuant to paragraph A, subparagraph (1) must reimburse to the 27 
school administrative unit a prorated amount based upon the allocations paid and the 28 
dates of the student's attendance.  The department shall adopt rules to implement the 29 
provisions of this paragraph.  Rules adopted  pursuant to this paragraph are routine 30 
technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.  31

legislation takes effect when approved. 
SUMMARY 
This bill provides that per-pupil allocations paid by a school administrative unit to a 
public charter school must be returned to the school administrative unit of the student's residence, on a prorated basis, if the student discontinues enrollment at the public charter school and returns to the school administrative unit during the school year. 
This bill also changes the allocation of a provision of law to clarify when a school 
ad
ministrative unit needs to transfer funds to a charter school for certain programs.
