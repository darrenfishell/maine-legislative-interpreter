SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is a minority report of the committee, makes the following 
changes to the bill: 
1. It removes the sections of the bill that repeal provisions that prohibit the State's 
denying food assistance and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, 
benefits to a person who has been convicted of a drug-related felony. It specifies that a 
person receiving TANF benefits who has been convicted of a drug-related felony and is 
within 20 years of that person's date of conviction is not able to reapply for cash 
assistance if the person fails a drug test and declines to enter a treatment plan or fails to 
meet the requirements of the treatment plan. It requires the Department of Health and 
Human Services to apply the same process to a person receiving food benefits who was 
convicted of a drug-related felony within 20 years of that person's date of conviction. 
2. It requires the Legislative Council to conduct screening and testing of Legislators 
for illegal substances. If a Legislator is required to submit to drug testing and refuses, or 
if the Legislator tests positive for the unlawful use of a drug and refuses to enter into a 
substance use disorder treatment plan or enters into a substance use disorder treatment 
plan and fails to meet a requirement of the plan, the Legislator is ineligible for annual 
legislative salary payments and must reimburse the State for any salary payments made to 
the Legislator since the convening of the Legislature. 
3. It requires the Governor's Office of Policy and Management to conduct yearly 
screening and testing of certain appointed state employees for illegal substances. If an 
appointed state employee is required to submit to drug testing and refuses, or if the 
employee tests positive for the unlawful use of a drug and refuses to enter into a 
substance use disorder treatment plan or enters into a substance use disorder treatment

LD 1407 LR 1994(03) 
An Act To Require Screening and Testing for Illegal Substances of Beneficiaries under the Temporary 
Fiscal Detail and Notes Assistance for Needy Families Program .) 
. Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment ~, (f/-t/~.fJ 
Committee: Health and Human Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium savings -Federal Block Grant Fund 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill adds a drug screening and testing component to the eligibility requirements for Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). The provisions of this bill were 
recently added to the TANF rules, so there is no fiscal impact to that program. There is an expectation that the biggest 
savings will be to the Federally funded SNAP benefits, but as these benefits do not pass through State accounts, there 
would be no state savings. There will be an increase in costs for administering the drug screening and for additional 
drug testing, however the actual cost is unable to be detelmined at this time. The SNAP expenditures related to drug 
testing and screening would be split 50/50 to the General Fund and Federal Fund Food Supplement Administrative 
account. The separate State funded SNAP program, which is 100% state funded, would see benefit savings, but these 
savings are expected to be less than the new costs to the General Fund. 
The Legislative and Executive Branches will incur additional General Fund costs associated with drug testing. The 
amount and timing of these costs cannot be determined at this time.
