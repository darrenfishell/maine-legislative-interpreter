Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง10110, sub -ยง4-A, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. A, 2 
ยง20 and affected by ยง30, is amended to read:  3 
4-A.  Procurement of cost -effective energy efficiency resources.   The comm ission 4 
shall ensure that transmission and distribution utilities on behalf of their ratepayers 5 
procure all electric energy efficiency resources found by the commission to be cost - 6 
effective, reliable and achievable pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4, e xcept that the 7 
commission may not require the inclusion in rates under this subsection of a total amount 8 
that exceeds 4% of total retail electricity and transmission and distribution sales in the 9 
State as determined by the commission by rule.  The cost of procurement of cost -effective 10 
electric energy efficiency resources is a just and reasonable element of rates.  The 11 
commission may issue any appropriate orders to transmission and distribution utilities 12 
necessary to achieve the goals of this subsection.  Wh en determining the amount of cost - 13 
effective electric energy efficiency resources to be procured under this subsection, the 14 
commission shall:  15 
A.  Consider electric energy efficiency resources that are reasonably foreseeable to be 16 
acquired by the trust using  all other sources of revenue, including, but not limited to, 17 
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund under section 10109;  18 
B.  Ensure that calculations of avoided energy costs and the budget identified by the 19 
trust in its triennial plan as needed  to capture all cost -effective electric energy 20 
efficiency resources are reasonable, based on sound evidence and make use of best 21 
practices across the region; and  22 
C.  Maximize total electricity savings for all ratepayers.  23 
The commission shall consider gross  efficiency savings for the purpose of determining 24 
savings that are cost -effective, reliable and achievable and shall consider both net and 25 
gross efficiency savings for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of the amount 26 
identified by the trust in  its triennial plan as needed to capture all cost -effective electric 27 
energy efficiency resources.  28 
Rules adopted under this subsection are routine technical rules under Title 5, chapter 375, 29 
subchapter 2 -A. 30
