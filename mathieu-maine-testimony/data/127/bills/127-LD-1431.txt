J.  In the case of major business expansion projects and transformational business 25 
expansion projects , the applicant is creditworthy and there is a strong likelihood that 26 
the revenue obligation securities will be repaid through the revenues of the projec t 27 
and any other sources of revenues and collateral pledged to the repayment of those 28 
securities.  In order to make this determination, the authority shall consider such 29 
factors as it considers necessary to measure and evaluate the sufficiency of the 30 
pledge d revenues to repay the obligations, including:  31 
(1)  Whether individuals or entities obligated to repay the obligations have 32 
demonstrated sufficient revenues from the project or from other sources to repay 33 
the obligations, and a strong probability that tho se revenues will continue to be 34 
available for the term of the revenue obligation securities;  35

continue to operate and provide the public benefits projected to be created for the 37

historical financial performance, management ability, its plan for marketing its 5 
product or service and its ability to access conventional financing;  6 
(5)  Whether the applicant meets or exceeds industry average fin ancial 7 
performance ratios commonly accepted in determining creditworthiness in that 8 
industry;  9 
(6)  Whether the applicant demonstrates that the need for authority assistance is 10 
due to the reduced cost and increased flexibility of the financing for the proje ct 11 
that result from authority assistance and not from an inability to obtain necessary 12 
financing without the capital reserve fund security provided by the authority; and  13 
(7)  Whether collateral securing the repayment obligation is reasonably sufficient 14 
under the circumstances.  15 
Financing assistance for any one major business expansion project may not exceed 16

activity, the taxpayer may petition for, or the State Tax Assessor may require, in respect 7 
to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, the employment of another 8
