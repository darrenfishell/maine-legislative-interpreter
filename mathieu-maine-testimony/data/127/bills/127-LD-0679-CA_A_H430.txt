6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment provides a new title and replaces the bill. Like the bi\1, the 
8 amendment prohibits unauthorized distribution of certain private images, but changes the 
9 term "distribution" to "dissemination," adds as elements of the crime the dissemination's 
10 being done with the intent to harass, torment or threaten the depicted person or another 
11 person, knowingly instead of intentionally and in a manner in which there is no public or 
12 newswOlihy purpose and adds masturbation to the definition of "sexual act." The 
13 amendment amends the law on protection from abuse procedure to allow a complaint to 
14 be filed by a victim of unauthorized dissemination of certain private images without 
15 regard to whether a criminal prosecution has occulTed. The amendment removes from 
16 the exceptions proposed in the bill the lawful and common practices of law enforcement, 
17 reporting unlawful activity and dissemination when permitted or required by law or rule 
18 in legal proceedings.
