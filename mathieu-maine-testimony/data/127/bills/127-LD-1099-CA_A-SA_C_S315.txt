This amendment reduces the fee from 20¢ on each container of consumer paclcaged pesticides to 10¢ and repeals the 
provision effective 5-1-17. It would result in a reduction in revenue of $120,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $228,000 
in fiscal year 2016-17 as compared to the committee amendment. This amendment also results in a corresponding 
reduction in the amount of funds transferred to the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund at the 
University of Maine Cooperative Extension. 
The amendment reduces the Other Special Revenue Funds allocations to $72,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $112,000 
in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund at the University of Maine 
Cooperative Extension for outreach and education initiatives on pest management and pest safety and for non­
administrative costs related to its animal and plant disease and insect control laboratory. 
The amendment removes the transfer from the Animal and Plant Disease and Insect Control Fund to the Department 
of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry for reimbursing costs to provide product codes for pesticide containers.
