certification in accordance with this section by a chief law enforcement officer may

proceeding relevant to the applicant's eligibility to lawfully possess or receive a firearm. 
A chief law enforcement officer may not require access to or consent for an inspection of 
any private premises as a condition of making a certification under this section.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill but addresses both of the matters addressed in the 
bill: the use of noise suppression devices while hunting and requirements governing a 
chief law enforcement officer's certification of a federal application to transfer or make a 
firearm. 
The portion of this amendment relating to the use of noise suppression devices: 
1. Until August 1, 2018, allows a person to use a noise suppression device while 
hunting, as long as the person has lawful possession of the device and has not had a 
hunting license revoked as a result of a serious hunting violation; 
2. Provides for enhanced penalties for a person who commits a hunting violation 
while in possession of a firearm with a noise suppression device; 
3. Provides for the permanent revocation of a person's hunting license and the seizure 
and libel of the person's firearm and noise suppression device if the person commits a 
serious hunting violation while in possession of a firearm with a noise suppression 
device; and 
4. Provides definitions of "hunting crime" and "serious hunting violation."

The portion of this amendment regarding a chief law enforcement officer's 
certification on a person's federal application to transfer or make a firearm, including a 
noise suppression device:

of receipt, unless the officer has information that prevents the officer from providing the

a certain type of firearm is not sufficient; 
2. Requires an officer who denies an application for certification to provide in 
writing the reasons for the denial; 
3. Clarifies that a denial of an application or refusal or failure to provide a 
certification is a governmental action subject to appeal under the Maine Rules of Civil

and prohibits the officer from requiring access or consent to inspect any private premises 
as a condition of making a certification.
