that has been lost, destroyed or stolen or that contains information that is no longer 38 
accurate and must establish application and renewal fees that generate revenues sufficient 39 
to offset all expenses of implementing and administering this chapter and that are 40 
consistent with the provisions of section 2425, subsection 12.  The department may 41 
establish a sliding scale of application and renewal fees based upon a registered patient's 42

approving an application or renewal under this section.  Registry identification cards 9 
expire one year after the date of issuance except that the date of issuance and expiration 10 
date of a registered primary caregiver's registry identification card must be the same as 11 
the issuance and expiration dates on the patient's registry identification card.  Registry 12

the confidentiality of information protected under this chapter commits a civil 22 
violation for which a fine of up to $1,000 may be imposed.  This paragraph does not 23 
apply to a medical provider or staff of a hospice provider or, nursing facility or 24 
hospital named as a primary caregiver or any other person directly associated with a 25 
medical provider or a hospice provider or, nursing facility or hospital that provides 26 
services to a registered patient. 27 
SUMMARY 28

patients, adds hospitals to the universe of medical facilities where qualifying patients may 30 
use and store forms of smokeless, prepared marijuana and eliminates the ability of these 31 
medical facilities to prohibit or restrict the use or storage of smokeless, prepared 32 
marijuana by a qualifying patient. 33
