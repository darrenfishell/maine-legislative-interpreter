127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1042, L.D. 1517, Bill, "An Act To 
Enable an Alternative Organizational Structure To Purchase Group Health Insurance for 
Its Employees" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in paragraph E by striking out all of the 2nd sentence 
(page 1, lines 22 to 28 in L.D.). 
Amend the bill in section 2 in subsection 2 by striking out all of the last sentence 
(page 2, lines 10 to 15 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 'For the purposes of this 
subsection, "school administrative unit" has the same meaning as in Title 20-A, section 1, 
subsection 26.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provision of the bill giving an alternative organizational 
structure specific authority to request, from an insurer providing health insurance, loss 
information for employees and retirees and their dependents, since school administrative 
units already have this authority and the definition of a school administrative unit in the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 20-A includes alternative organizational structures. This 
amendment also provides a cross-reference to that definition to make clear that it includes 
alternative organizational structures.
