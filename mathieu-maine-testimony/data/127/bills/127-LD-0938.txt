 SUMMARY  1 
This bill reduces by half, from $1 to 50 cents per ton, the fees collected by the 2 
Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry on commercial fertilizer sold in 3 
the State.  It also simplifies  and clarifies the restitution process whereby farmers are 4 
compensated for deficient fertilizer products.  5
