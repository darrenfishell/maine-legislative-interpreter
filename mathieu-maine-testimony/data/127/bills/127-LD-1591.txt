ยง4877.  Veterinarian -client -patient relationship required; Good Samaritan 3 
exception; informed consent exception  4 
In order to practice veterinary medicine, a veterinarian must be engaged in a 5 
veterinarian -client -patient relationship.  A veterinarian -client -patient relationship exists 6 
when a veterinarian:  7 
1.  Engaged by client.  Has been engaged by the client;  8 
2.  Assume d responsibility.  Has assumed responsibility for making medical 9 
judgments regarding the health of the patient;  10 
3.  Knowledge of patient.  Has sufficient knowledge of the patient to initiate a 11 
preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the patient a nd has personal knowledge 12 
of the keeping and care of the patient as a result of:  13 
A.  A timely examination of the patient by the veterinarian; or  14 
B.  A medically appropriate and timely visit or visits by the veterinarian to the patient 15 
while that patient is  under the care of the veterinarian's practice;  16 
4.  Follow -up evaluation.  Is readily available for follow -up evaluation or has 17 
arranged for veterinary emergency coverage and continuing care and treatment; and  18 
5.  Records.  Maintains patient records.  19 
A lic ensed veterinarian who in good faith engages in the practice of veterinary 20 
medicine by rendering or attempting to render emergency care to a patient when a client 21 
cannot be identified and a veterinarian -client -patient relationship is not established is not  22 
subject to any disciplinary sanctions authorized by Title 10, section 8003, subsection 5 -A 23 
based solely upon the veterinarian's inability to establish a veterinarian -client -patient 24 
relationship.  25 
A licensed veterinarian may administer a vaccination against  rabies, distemper, 26 
parvovirus, rhinotracheitis or panleukopenia in a vaccination clinic setting in the absence 27 
of a veterinarian -client -patient relationship if the veterinarian obtains a signed informed 28 
consent waiver from the pet owner.  The informed con sent waiver must include 29 
information to ensure that the pet owner is aware of the potential adverse events that may 30 
result from vaccinations and is aware that a vaccine given at a vaccination clinic is not a 31 
substitute for a complete physical examination.  32 
SUMMARY  33 
This bill amends the Maine Veterinary Practice Act to allow an exception to the 34 
requirement that a veterinarian must be engaged in a veterinarian -client -patient 35 
relationship in order to practice veterinary medicine.  This exception allows a veterin arian 36

 to administer a vaccination against rabies, distemper, parvovirus, rhinotracheitis or 1 
panleukopenia at a vaccination clinic if the pet owner signs an informed consent waiver.  2
