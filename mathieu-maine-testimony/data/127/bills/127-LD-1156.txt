SUMMARY  32 
Public Law 2011, chapter 581 established dental adjudicatory panels and gave those 33 
panel s sole authority to hold adjudicatory hearings regarding disciplinary actions for 34 
persons licensed by the Board of Dental Examiners.  The board retained investigative 35 
powers but all complaints were required to be referred to a dental adjudicatory panel for  a 36 
disciplinary hearing.  The section of law establishing the adjudicatory panels was 37 
repealed on September 15, 2014, leaving the board without a means to hold disciplinary 38 
hearings.  39 
This bill returns to the Board of Dental Examiners the authority to condu ct 40 
disciplinary hearings.  41
