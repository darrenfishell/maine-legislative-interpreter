The bill requires individuals filing a petition or request to establish a water level regime to pay a licensing fee of no 
more than $20,000 to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to cover the costs of any adjudicatory 
hearing. The amount of savings will depend on the number of adjudicatory hearings held and their costs. No estimate 
is made at this time of the number or cost offuture adjudicatory hearings, although DEP anticipates no more than two 
water level regime adjudications per year.
