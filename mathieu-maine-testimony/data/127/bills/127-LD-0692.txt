 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the United States Department of Education requires that revisions be 3 
made to the Maine Rev ised Statutes, Title 20 -A, sections 13704 and 13706 and that 4 
corresponding amendments to Maine Department of Education Rule Chapter 180 be in 5 
effect by March 15, 2015 in order to be in compliance with the federal Elementary and 6 
Secondary Education Act of 1 965; and  7 
Whereas, because Rule Chapter 180 is a major substantive rule, changes to the rule 8 
require legislative review before the changes may be made; and  9 
Whereas, the Legislature has the authority to direct the Department of Education to 10 
amend its rule to  reflect legislative policy determinations; and  11 
Whereas,  the Department of Education, educators and administrators need statutory 12 
and rule revisions to be in compliance with the federal Elementary and Secondary 13 
Education Act of 1965; and  14 
Whereas, in the j udgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 15 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 16 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 17 
therefore,  18 
Be it en acted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  19 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §13704, sub -§3, ¶A, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 635, Pt. A, 20 
§3, is amended to read:  21 
A.  The rating must be based on standards of professional practice and measures of 22 
educator effective ness.  The proportionate weight of the standards and the measures 23 
is a local decision, but measurements of student learning and growth must be a 24 
significant factor in the determination of the rating of an educator.  School 25 
administrative units shall use st ate assessment growth data for English language arts, 26 
literacy and mathematics as at least one measure of the performance of English 27 
language arts and mathematics teachers in tested grades and as a measure for the 28 
performance of principals.  29 
An educator who se summative effectiveness rating indicates ineffectiveness must 30 
receive an annual summative effectiveness evaluation and rating until the rating 31 
improves.  32 
An individualized education plan may not be used to measure student growth for the 33 
purposes of teach er and principal evaluation, but an individualized education plan 34 
may be a source of evidence from which learning objectives and learning targets may 35 
be developed.  36 
Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §13706, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 635, Pt. A, §3, is amended 37 
to read:  38

 Subsection 4 must also provide that individual educ ation plan goals are important tools 1 
for individualizing instruction and learning and may be used to establish an appropriate 2 
basis for measuring student growth, but progress toward completion of an individual 3 
education plan may not be used as a growth mea sure in the evaluation of a teacher.  4 
16.  Section 7, subsection 5 must be deleted and replaced with a provision regarding 5 
the use of state assessment results for tested subjects and grades that provides that the 6 
Maine Educational Assessment for Mathematics  and English Language Arts/Literacy 7 
State Assessment results must be used as one measure of student learning and growth for 8 
teachers in the corresponding grades and subjects.  These results must:  9 
A.  Be attributed to teachers of record in accordance with t he criteria for a teacher of 10
