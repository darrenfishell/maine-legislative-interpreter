vacate any preliminary protection order issued. This notice is not required if the petitioner 
includes in the petition a sworn statement of his eelief detailing a sufficient factual basis 
that: 
A. The child would suffer serious harm during the time needed to notify the 
parents, legal guardian or custodians; or 
B. Prior notice to the parents, legal guardian or custodians would increase the risk 
of serious harm to the child or petitioner. 
Failure to provide the notice required by this section, after a good faith attempt to do so, 
does not constitute grounds for denial of a preliminary protection order.' 
Amend the bill in section 10 in subsection 3-A in the 2nd line (page 3, line 26 in 
L.D.) by striking out the following: "his" and inserting the following: 'his-the child's'

6. Notice to legal guardians. When notice is required to be given to the legal 
guardian of a child, the department shall provide notice to all of the child's legal 
guardians that are known to the department.' 
Amend the bill by inserting after section 13 the following: 
'Sec. 14. 22 MRSA §4034, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2001, c. 696, §26, is 
further amended to read: 
4. Summary preliminary hearing. If the eHStosial pa-reat appea-rs aas sees aot

less than 7 days after issuance of the preliminary protection order, except that counsel for 
a parent may request that the hearing take place sooner. Upon request of counsel, the 
court may conduct the summary preliminary hearing as expeditiously as the court 
determines the interests of justice require. If a parent, custodian or legal guardian appears 
for the summary preliminary hearing and does not consent to the preliminary protection 
order, the court shall conduct a hearing at which the petitioner bears the burden of proof. 
At a summary preliminary hearing, the court may limit testimony to the testimony of the 
caseworker, parent, custodian, legal guardian, guardian ad litem, foster parent, 
preadoptive parent or relative providing care and may admit evidence, including reports 
and records, that would otherwise be inadmissable as hearsay evidence. If after the 
hearing the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that returning the child to the 
child's custodian would place the child in immediate risk of serious harm, it shall 
continue the order or make another disposition under section 4036. If the court's 
preliminary protection order includes a finding of an aggravating factor, the court may 
order the department not to commence reunification or to cease reunification, in which 
case the court shall conduct a hearing on jeopardy and conduct a permanency planning

hearing. The hearings must commence within 30 days of entry of the preliminary 
protection order. 
If the petitioner has not been able to serve a parent, custodian or legal guardian before the 
scheduled summary preliminary hearing. the parent, custodian or legal guardian may 
request a subsequent summary preliminary hearing within 10 days after receipt of the 
petition.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment deletes from the bill sections 1 through 5, which change the 
confidentiality provisions of the child protective statutes, and instead adds a new 
administrative hearing process to give parents, custodians and legal guardians an 
opportunity to seek a review of the discretionary denial of access to information in child 
protection records. The hearing must be conducted by the Department of Health and 
Human Services under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act. The parents, custodians 
and legal guardians can appeal the decision of the hearing officer as a final agency action. 
This amendment strikes out section 8 of the bill, which addresses notice about a 
request for a preliminary protection order, and replaces it with language that clarifies that, 
when the department gives notice that it will be seeking a preliminary protection order, 
the notice does not include the time and place when the petition will be presented to a 
judge, but must include the court in which the counsel for the parents, legal guardian or 
custodians may file motions, including motions to modify or vacate any preliminary 
protection order that is issued. This amendment also requires that the information 
provided to the court explaining why notice is not required must include a sworn 
statement detailing a sufficient factual basis either that the child would suffer serious 
harm during the time needed to notify the parents, legal guardian or custodians or that 
prior notice would increase the risk of serious harm to the child or the petitioner. This 
amendment clarifies that failure to provide the required notice, after a good faith attempt 
to do so, does not constitute grounds for denial of a preliminary protection order. 
This amendment amends section 10 to make current law gender-neutral. 
This amendment deletes section 12, which provides for a new expedited process for 
dissolving or modifying a preliminary protection order, and instead amends the Maine 
Revised Statutes, Title 22, section 4034, subsection 4 to allow the summary preliminary 
hearing to be expedited upon request by the parent's counsel. Upon counsel's request, the 
court may conduct the summary preliminary hearing, the first hearing opportunity 
available after the preliminary protection order is issued, as expeditiously as the court 
determines the interests of justice require. 
This amendment retains the language in current law that provides that, if the 
department has not been able to serve a parent, custodian or legal guardian before the 
scheduled summary preliminary hearing, the parent, custodian or legal guardian may 
request a subsequent summary preliminary hearing within 10 days after the parent, 
custodian or legal guardian receives the petition.
