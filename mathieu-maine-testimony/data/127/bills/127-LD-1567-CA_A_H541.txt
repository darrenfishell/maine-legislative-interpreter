The bill allows the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to construct snowmobile trails 
and/or ATV trails within the right-of-way limits of a controlled access highway if the Department of Transportation or 
the board of directors of the Maine Turnpike Authority allow it. ACF has indicated that it would incur costs totaling 
$70,000 to $225,000 over approximately 4 years to develop these trails if given pennission to build. Construction, if 
permission were granted, is estimated to staii in fiscal year 2018-19. All costs to ACF will be funded by the 
Snowmobile Trail Fund for snowmobile trails and the ATV Recreational Management Fund for ATV trails. These 
accourits are both within ACF and have sufficient resources to absorb these costs. 
Additional costs to the Depaiiment of Transportation and Maine Turnpike Authority associated with reviewing these 
requests can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
