 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  28-A MRSA ยง10, sub -ยง2-A, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 344, ยง1, is 2 
amended to read:  3 
2-A.  Access exception.   Notwithstanding subsection 2, there may be access between 4 
the 2 licensed areas b y the public as provided by this subsection.  5 
A.  There may be access between the 2 licensed areas when there is a clear 6 
delineation of space, by a wall or permanent barrier that separates the 2 licensed areas 7 
and allows only one clearly defined and control led point of access for patrons 8 
between the licensed establishments.  The controlled point of access is not required to 9 
include a door that must be physically opened and closed.  10 
B.  When access between the 2 licensed areas exists for patrons of either 11 
establishment, all malt liquor and wine sold for on -premises consumption must be 12 
served by an employee of the licensed establishment and may be served only when 13 
accompanying a full meal prepared in a separate and complete kitchen on the 14 
premises.  For the purp oses of this paragraph, "full meal" means a diversified 15 
selection of food that cannot ordinarily be consumed without the use of tableware and 16 
cannot be conveniently consumed while standing or walking.  17 
C.  Malt liquor or wine sold or served on the premises may not be transported by a 18 
patron or employee of either establishment from one licensed area to another.  The 19 
licensee shall ensure that easily readable signs are conspicuously posted to inform the 20 
public that transfer of alcoholic beverages from one lice nsed area to another is strictly 21 
prohibited.  22 
This subsection is repealed September 30, 2015.  23 
SUMMARY  24

under certain conditions, to have a license to sell beer and wine for on -premises 26 
consumption in one area of the establishment and a license to sell beer and wine for off - 27 
premises consumption in a separate area of the establishment.  28
