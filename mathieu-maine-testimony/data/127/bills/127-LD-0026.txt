 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 2 
Whereas, many taxpayers when they file income tax returns request a fuel tax 3 
refund for off-highway purposes such as farming and fishing; and 4 
Whereas, it is important to change the period for which refund requests may be 5 
made during the 2015 income tax filing period ending April 15, 2015; and 6 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 7 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 8 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 9 
therefore, 10 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 11 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §2908, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 438, §70, is further 12

A refund application on a form prescribed by the State Tax Assessor must be filed to 14 
claim a refund pursuant to this section. Interest must be paid at the rate determined 15 
pursuant to section 186, calculated from the date of receipt of the claim, for all proper 16 
claims not paid within 30 days of receipt.  Applications for refunds must be filed with the 17 
assessor within 12 16 months from the date of purchase. 18 
Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §3218, 2nd ¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 438, §87, is further 19 
amended to read: 20

within 30 days of receipt.  Applications for refunds must be filed with the assessor within 24 
12 16 months from the date of purchase. 25

legislation takes effect when approved. 27
