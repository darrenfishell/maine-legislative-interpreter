 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  30-A MRSA §3158 is enacted to read:  2 
§3158.  Municipal fire districts  3 
1.  Ordinance.  A municipal legislative body may enact an ordinance to create a 4 
municipal fire district within the m unicipality either as part of or independently from a 5 
fire district established pursuant to chapter 164, referred to in this section as "a multi - 6 
municipal fire district."  7 
A.  A municipal fire district established pursuant to this section, if independent fr om 8 
a multi -municipal fire district, may contain all or part of the municipality.  9 
B.  A municipal fire district established pursuant to this section by a municipality that 10 
is a member of a multi -municipal fire district must encompass the entire municipality . 11 
The financial administration of such a municipal fire district is governed by 12 
subsection 5.  13 
2.  Service charges.  A municipal fire district ordinance under subsection 1 must 14 
establish service charges for fire protection within the municipal fire distric t based on an 15 
estimate of the cost of providing the services in the same manner as those costs are 16 
estimated pursuant to section 3537.  The service charges must be levied against all 17 
property owners or parties in possession of property within the municipal  fire district, 18 
including institutions and organizations otherwise exempt from taxation under Title 36, 19 
sections 651 and 652. Unless otherwise established by ordinance, the service charges to 20 
each owner or person in possession of property within the munici pal fire district must be 21 
established on the basis of a fee per square foot of building determined by dividing the 22 
estimated total cost of providing fire services to the district by the total square footage of 23 
all built properties within the district. Any alternative to this method of calculation as 24 
established by ordinance must be reasonably designed to more accurately reflect the 25 
distribution of fire protection costs among different types and uses of properties within 26 
the municipal fire district. With res pect to the calculation and levy of service charges, 27 
appeals must be made in accordance with an appeals process provided by municipal 28 
ordinance.  29 
3.  Unpaid service charges; collection.  The collection of unpaid service charges 30 
levied pursuant to subsection  2 must be carried out in the same manner as provided in 31 
Title 38, section 1208.  32 
4.  Revenues; use.  Municipalities must use the revenues accrued from service 33 
charges levied pursuant to subsection 2 to fund the cost of fire protection.  34 
5.  Participation by  municipality in multi -municipal fire district.  A municipality 35 
that is a member of a multi -municipal fire district that elects to create a municipal fire 36 
district to cover the costs of the municipal fire district is governed by this section, except 37 
as pro vided in this subsection.  38 
A.  The municipality may participate in the funding of the multi -municipal fire 39 
district as provided in chapter 164.  40 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1032(01) -1 
 B.  The municipality may participate in the funding of the multi -municipal fire 1 
district by establishing a servic e charge for fire protection within the municipal fire 2 
district.  The service charge must be based on an estimate of the cost of providing the 3 
services in the same manner as those costs are estimated pursuant to section 3537.  4 
C.  The municipality must coll ect the service charges authorized by this section to 5 
cover the municipality's allocation to the multi -municipal fire district as provided in 6 
section 3537, subsection 3, but failure of a property owner or party in possession to 7 
pay such charges to the muni cipality does not alter a municipality's duty to remit full 8 
payment of its allocation to the multi -municipal fire district.  9 
D.  In the event a property owner or party in possession of property fails to pay its 10 
service charge to the municipality, the munici pality may collect the service charges as 11 
provided in subsection 3.  12

the taxable estates within those municipalities and to  or in accordance with a municipal 20 
fire district ordinance enacted by a municipality pursuant to section 3158. The 21 
municipalities must  commit their assessment to the constabl e or collector of the 22 
municipalities.  The constable or collector has all the authority and powers to collect 23 
these taxes as is vested by law to collect state, county and municipal taxes.  Within 30 24 
days after the date fixed by the municipality on which it s taxes are due, the treasurer of 25 
the municipality shall pay the amount of the tax assessed under this section to the 26 
treasurer of the district.  27
