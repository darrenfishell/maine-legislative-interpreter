experience, family physical and mental health and other conditions that affect a person's 
ability to work. The family profile developed during the comprehensive screening and

not qualify for TANF but earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level qualify for 
the program. 
3. It allows educational institutions and programs in the State to refer eligible 
applicants to the Parents as Scholars Program. 
4. It establishes the Transitional Jobs Program in the Department of Health and 
Human Services for families unable to find employment through conventional means.

program. Performance data on the program must be collected by the department. 
5. It develops a voucher program through the Maine State Housing Authority for 
families with shelter expenses that exceed 50% of their monthly income. 
6. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to collect data related to 
performance measures of the T ANF program, including reducing child poverty and food 
insecurity and improving educational attainment, employment and income levels. It also 
requires the department to set benchmarks to measure improvement and success of the 
T ANF program. 
7. It establishes the Independent Citizens Oversight Committee to monitor the 
Department of Health and Human Services' progress with respect to meeting benchmarks 
for success of the T ANF program. 
8. It requires any administrative, technological or other costs associated with the 
changes to the T ANF program outlined in the amendment to be funded by using the

$28,952,909 in fiscal year 2016-17 to establish a service delivery model with different pathways that are based on the 
levels of education, work experience, family physical and mental health and other conditions that affect a person's 
ability to work, to establish a Transitional Jobs Program for families unable to find employment through conventional 
means and collect performance data on the program and to change the eligibility for the Parents as Scholars program 
so that families that do not qualify for TANF but earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level qualify. It also 
will require the DHHS to enhance some technologies to collect data related to the performance of the T ANF program, 
including reducing poverty rates and food insecurity, improving educational attainment, employment and income 
levels and to set benchmarks to measure improvement and success of the TANF program. Finally, it establishes an 
independent citizen oversight committee to monitor the DHHS's progress with respect to meeting benchmarks for 
success of the TANF program. 
This bill requires any administrative, technological or other costs associated with the changes to the TANF program 
outlined in this bill to be funded by utilizing the federal funding within the State Family Assistance Grant of the 
TANF program. 
The Maine State Housing Authority expects that the costs to administer the housing assistance program will be 
covered by the provisions included in this legislation and no General Fund appropriations will be required.
