This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to implement a demonstration project to provide 
enhanced rates for home care services to a limited population and report no later than January 15, 2018 on the _, 
findings of the demonstration. The bill does not outline the amount of the enhanced rates for home care services and, 
therefore, no estimate of the increased cost can be made at this time. 
The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services' quality assurance review committee to conduct a 
review of the adequacy of home care services provided to certain individuals and to submit a report, no later than 
January 15, 2017, to the Legislature detailing findings and any recommendations. Any additional costs to the 
Department of Health and Human Services to conduct the review and submit a report are expected to be minor and 
can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
