5.  Proposal and selection processes. The department may request proposals from 11

A.  If the department receives an unsolicited proposal and determines that it meets the 14 
standards in this subchapter, the department sh all publish a notice of the receipt of the 15 
proposal on the department's publicly accessible website or through advertisements in 16 
newspapers.  If a notice is published exclusively in newspapers, the notice must 17 
appear in 2 or more public newspapers circulat ed wholly or in part in the State and in 18 
one public newspaper circulated wholly or in part in the county where the proposed 19 
transportation facility is to be located if any such newspaper is circulated in that 20 
county.  The notice must provide that the depar tment will accept, for 120 days after 21 
the initial date of publication, proposals meeting the standards in subsection 4 from 22 
other private entities for transportation facilities that satisfy the same basic purpose 23 
and need.  A copy of the notice must be mai led to each local government in the area 24 
affected by the proposal.  25 
B.  After the proposal or proposals have been received, and any public notification 26 
period has expired, the department shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In 27 
ranking the propos als, the department may consider factors that include, but are not 28 
limited to, professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering 29 
or cost -reduction terms, finance plans and the need for state funds to deliver the 30 
project and discha rge the agreement.  The department shall undertake negotiations 31 
with the private entity submitting the 1st -ranked proposal.  If the department is not 32 
satisfied with the results of the negotiations, the department may, at its sole 33 
discretion, terminate nego tiations with that entity and the department may negotiate 34 
with the other entities in order of the ranking of their proposals.  If only one proposal 35 
is received, the department shall negotiate in good faith and, if the department is not 36 
satisfied with the results of the negotiations, the department may, at its sole 37 
discretion, terminate negotiations.  38 
C.  The department may require that the private entity assume responsibility for all 39 
costs incurred by the State or local governments before execution of the a greement, 40 
including costs of retaining independent experts to review, analyze and advise the 41 
department with respect to the proposal.  42
