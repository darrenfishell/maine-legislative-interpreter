of people with mental illness or persons with intellectual disabilities or autism.  An 6 
appropriate program may be in an institution for the care and treatment of peo ple 7 
with mental illness, an intermediate care facility for persons who have intellectual 8 
disabilities or autism, a crisis stabilization unit, a nursing home, a residential care 9 
facility, an assisted living facility, a hospice, a hospital, an intensive outp atient 10 
treatment program or any program specifically approved by the court.  An 11 
appropriate program may be in a mental health unit of a correctional facility if, based 12 
upon a consensus recommendation of a panel, the Commissioner of Health and 13 
Human Service s or the commissioner's designee determines that there is a therapeutic 14 
treatment advantage to placing the person in a mental health unit of a correctional 15 
facility.  Placement of a person in a mental health unit of a correctional facility must 16 
be reviewed  by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the 17 
commissioner's designee at least every 6 months and may not continue beyond 6 18 
months unless, based upon a subsequent review and consensus recommendation of a 19 
panel, the Commissioner of Health and Hum an Services or the commissioner's 20 
designee determines that there is a therapeutic treatment advantage to the continued 21 
placement of the person in a mental health unit of a correctional facility.   At the end 22 
of 30 days or sooner, and again in the event of r ecommitment, at the end of 60 days 23 
and 180 days, the State Forensic Service or other appropriate office of the 24 
Department of Health and Human Services shall forward a report to the 25 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services relative to the defendant's compe tence 26 
to stand trial and its reasons.  The Commissioner of Health and Human Services shall 27 
without delay file the report with the court having jurisdiction of the case.  The court 28 
shall hold a hearing on the question of the defendant's competence to stand trial and 29 
receive all relevant testimony bearing on the question.  If the State Forensic Service's 30 
report or the report of another appropriate office of the Department of Health and 31 
Human Services to the court states that the defendant is either now compet ent or not 32 
restorable, the court shall within 30 days hold a hearing.  If the court determines that 33 
the defendant is not competent to stand trial, but there does exist a substantial 34 
probability that the defendant will be competent to stand trial in the for eseeable 35 
future, the court shall recommit the defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of 36 
Health and Human Services for placement in an appropriate program for observation, 37 
care and treatment of people with mental illness or persons with intellectual 38 
disabilities or autism.  An appropriate program may be in an institution for the care 39

who have intellectual disabilities or autism, a crisis stabilization unit, a nursing  home, 41 
a residential care facility, an assisted living facility, a hospice, a hospital, an intensive 42 
outpatient treatment program or any program specifically approved by the court.  An 43 
appropriate program may be in a mental health unit of a correctional fa cility if, based 44 
upon a consensus recommendation of a panel, the Commissioner of Health and 45 
Human Services or the commissioner's designee determines that there is a therapeutic 46

facility.  Placement of a person in a mental health unit of a correctional facility must 2 
be reviewed by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the 3

months unless, b ased upon a subsequent review and consensus recommendation of a 5 
panel, the Commissioner of Health and Human Services or the commissioner's 6 
designee determines that there is a therapeutic treatment advantage to the continued 7 
placement of the person in a men tal health unit of a correctional facility.   When a 8 
person who has been evaluated on behalf of the court by the State Forensic Service or 9 
other appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services is 10 
committed into the custody of the Commissio ner of Health and Human Services 11 
under this paragraph, the court shall order that the State Forensic Service or other 12 
appropriate office of the Department of Health and Human Services share any 13

institution or residential program in which the person is placed.  If the defendant is 15 
charged with an offense under Title 17 -A, chapter 9, 11 or 13 or Title 17 -A, section 16 
506-A, 802 or 803 -A and the court determines that the defendant  is not competent to 17 
stand trial and there does not exist a substantial probability that the defendant can be 18 
competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall dismiss all charges against the 19 
defendant and, unless the defendant is subject to an undischa rged term of 20 
imprisonment, order the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to commence 21 
proceedings pursuant to Title 34 -B, chapter 3, subchapter 4.  If the defendant is 22

Title 17 -A, section 506 -A, 802 or 803 -A and the court determines that the defendant 24

charges against the defendant and, unless the defendant is subject to an undischarged 27 
term of imprisonment, notify the appropriate authorities who may institute civil 28 
commitment proceedings for the individual.  If the defendant is subject to an 29

health unit of a correctional facility.   Upon placement in the appropriate institution or 12
