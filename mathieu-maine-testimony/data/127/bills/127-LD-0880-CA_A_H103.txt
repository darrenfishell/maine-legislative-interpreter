127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "Ii" to H.P. 599, L.D. 880, Bill, "An Act To Permit 
Rate-adjustment Mechanisms for Water Utilities" 
Amend the bill in section 1 in ยง6102-A by striking out all of subsection 1 (page 1, 
lines 4 to 9 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'1. Rate-adjustment mechanism. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
contrary. the commission may establish or authorize a reasonable rate-adjustment 
mechanism to decouple water utility revenues from water utility sales through revenue 
reconciliation when changes in sales are due to a change in the number of customers or a 
change in the volume of consumption. In determining the reasonableness of any such 
rate-adjustment mechanism, the commission shall apply the standards of section 301 and 
shall consider the transfer of risks associated with any such changes in sales and, to the 
extent these risks are transferred between the utility and its customers, the commission 
shall consider the effect of the transfer of risk in determining a utility's allowed rate of 
return.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the method proposed in the bill by which the Public 
Utilities Commission may authorize a reasonable rate-adjustment mechanism to allow the 
commission of its own volition to establish or authorize a reasonable rate-adjustment 
mechanism to decouple water utility revenues from water utility sales through revenue 
reconciliation when there is a change in sales due to a change in the number of customers 
or a change in the volume of consumption.
