Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) not assess any large volume customer of a gas utility or 
make any final decision regarding the appropriateness or size of assessments on large volume customers until 90 days i 
after adjournment of the Second Regular Session of the l27th Legislature in fiscal year 2016-17. There is a pending 
proceeding at the PUC dealing with Efficiency Maine Trust's (EMT) triennial plan and the issue of whether to assess 
these large volume customers is being decided. Large volume customers are not currently being assessed by the PUC. 
Any revenue, if they were to be assessed, would be transferred to EMT by the PUC. No estimate is made at this time 
on whether and at what rate they would be assessed. Any additional costs to EMT to meet with representatives of 
large volume customers and other interested stakeholders are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
