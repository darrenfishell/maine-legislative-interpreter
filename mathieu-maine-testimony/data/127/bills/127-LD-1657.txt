SUMMARY  24 
This bill, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, allows a qualified 25 
individual who earned a bachelor's or as sociate degree from an accredited Maine 26 
community college, college or university after December 31, 2007 but before January 1, 27 
2016 to be eligible for the educational opportunity tax credit regardless of the number of 28 
transfer credits earned at a non -Maine  community college, college or university.  Under 29 
current law, an individual who earned more than 30 credit hours from a non -Maine 30 
community college, college or university prior to 2016 does not qualify for the credit.  31 
The bill, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, allows a resident of 32 
Maine who is employed at least part time in a position on a vessel at sea to qualify for the 33 
educational opportunity tax credit.  Under current law, an individual, other than an 34 
individual deployed for militar y service, does not qualify for the credit if the individual 35 
works outside Maine for more than 3 months.  36 
The bill, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, encourages employers to 37 
pay student loan payments by expanding the employer credit to in clude graduate degrees 38 
earned by qualified employees and by removing the principal cap relative to qualified 39 
employees.  40
