 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the value of property within a municipality is a major factor in the 3 
calculation of munici pal revenue sharing and general purpose aid for local schools; and  4 
Whereas, the Town of Madison derives a large portion of its tax valuation from the 5 
presence of the Madison Paper Company, and the Town of Skowhegan derives a large 6 
portion of its tax valuat ion from the presence of the S.D. Warren Company; and  7 
Whereas, between the 2013 and 2014 tax years, the value of the Madison Paper 8 
Company has been reduced by $149,700,000, representing 65% of its taxable value, and 9 
the value of the S.D. Warren Company has  been reduced by $100,000,000, representing 10 
18% of its taxable value, as a result of the weakness in the market for printed paper 11 
products; and  12 
Whereas, prior to this decrease, the Madison Paper Company represented 13 
approximately 40% of the tax base of the Town of Madison, and the S.D. Warren 14 
Company represented approximately 9.5% of the tax base of the Town of Skowhegan; 15 
and 16 
Whereas, unless immediate action is taken to account for this decrease in valuation, 17 
the Town of Madison and the Town of Skowhegan wil l experience the loss of significant 18 
revenues based on the decreased valuation of the Madison Paper Company and the S.D. 19 
Warren Company; and  20 
Whereas, in the absence of legislative action, the state valuation of the Town of 21 
Madison and the Town of Skowhegan  will not be adjusted to reflect this significant 22 
reduction in value for 2 years; and  23 
Whereas, in the absence of legislative action, the distribution of general purpose aid 24 
for local schools to Regional School Unit No. 59, a school unit composed entirely o f the 25 
Town of Madison, and to Regional School Unit No. 54, a school unit composed of the 26 
towns of Skowhegan, Canaan, Cornville, Mercer, Smithfield and Norridgewock, will be 27 
calculated on the basis of an inaccurate equalized valuation for at least 3 years; and 28 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 29 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 30 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now , 31 
therefore, be it  32 
Sec. 1.  Modify 2015 state valuations.  Resolved:  That, notwithstanding the 33 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 36, the 2015 state valuations for the Town of Madison and 34 
the Town of Skowhegan for the purposes of calculating state -municipal re venue -sharing 35 
funds and the distribution of general purpose aid for local schools must be based on a 36

Madison at $80,000,000 and values the property of the S.D. Warren Company in  the 38 
Town of Skowhegan at $463,224,200; and be it further  39
