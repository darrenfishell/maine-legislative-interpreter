D.  The Juvenile Court shall consider the following factors in deciding whether to 4 
bind a  juvenile over to Superior Court  for prosecution as an adult : 5 
(1)  Seriousness of the crime: the nature and seriousness of the offense with 6 
greater weight being given to offenses against the person than against property; 7 
whether the offense was committed i n an aggressive, violent, premeditated or 8 
intentional manner;  9 
(2)  Characteristics of the juvenile: the record and previous history of the 10 
juvenile; the age of the juvenile; the juvenile's emotional attitude and pattern of 11 
living;  12 
(3)  Public safety: whet her the protection of the community requires commitment 13 
of the juvenile for a period longer than the greatest commitment authorized; 14 
whether the protection of the community requires commitment of the juvenile to 15 
a facility that is more secure than any disp ositional alternative under section 16 
3314; and  17 
(4)  Dispositional alternatives: whether future criminal conduct by the juvenile 18

committed it; and  28 
(2)  After a consideration of t he seriousness of the crime, the characteristics of 29 
the juvenile, the public safety and the dispositional alternatives in paragraph D, 30 
that: 31 
(a)  If the State has the burden of proof, the State has established by a 32 
preponderance of the evidence that it is appropriate to prosecute the juvenile 33 
as if the juvenile were an adult; or  34

juvenile as if the juvenile were an adult.  37
