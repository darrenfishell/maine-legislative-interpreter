127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " e," to S.P. 272, L.D. 742, "RESOLUTION, 
Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Require That 5 Percent of 
Signatures on a Direct Initiative of Legislation Come from Each County" 
Amend the resolution by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'RESOLUTION, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Maine To Require 
That Signatures on a Direct Initiative of Legislation Come from Each Congressional 
District' 
Amend the resolution by striking out all of subsection 2 (page 1, lines 5 to 24 in L.D.) 
and inserting the following: 
'2. Referral to electors unless enacted by the Legislature without change; 
number of signatures necessary on direct initiative petitions; dating signatures on 
petitions; competing measures. For any measure thus proposed by electors, the number 
of signatures of voters from each congressional district shall not be less than 10% of the 
total vote for Governor cast in that congressional district in the last gubernatorial election 
preceding the filing of such petition. The date each signature was made shall be written 
next to the signature on the petition. A signature is not valid if it is dated more than one 
year prior to the date that the petition was filed in the office of the Secretary of State. The 
measure thus proposed, unless enacted without change by the Legislature at the session at 
which it is presented, shall be submitted to the electors together with any amended form, 
substitute, or recommendation of the Legislature, and in such manner that the people can 
choose between the competing measures or reject both. When there are competing bills 
and neither receives a majority of the votes given for or against both, the one receiving 
the most votes shall at the next statewide election to be held not less than 60 days after 
the first vote thereon be submitted by itself if it receives more than 1/3 of the votes given 
for and against both. If the measure initiated is enacted by the Legislature without 
change, it shall not go to a referendum vote unless in pursuance of a demand made in 
accordance with the preceding section. The Legislature may order a special election on 
any measure that is subject to a vote of the people.'

19 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT"(?)" to S.P. 272, L.D. 742 
Amend the resolution in the question in the 2nd line (page 1, line 33 in L.D.) by 
striking out the following: "registered to vote in all counties" and inserting the following: 
'from each congressional district' 
Amend the resolution in the 2nd paragraph from the end in the 8th line (page 1, line 
42 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "the date of the proclamation" and inserting the 
following: 'March 1, 2017' 
SUMMARY 
The resolution proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to require that signatures 
on a petition to directly initiate legislation be of voters from every county of the State. 
This amendment instead proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to require that the 
signatures on a petition to directly initiate legislation be of voters from each of the State's 
2 congressional districts and that the number of signatures from each congressional 
district be not less than 10% of the total votes for Governor cast in that congressional 
district in the previous gubernatorial election. This amendment provides that, if the 
required votes are cast in favor of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, the 
proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution on March 1, 2017 instead of on 
the date of the Governor's proclamation.
