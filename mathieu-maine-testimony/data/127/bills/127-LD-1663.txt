 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes the following changes to the law relating to recruitment, hiring and 2 
retention of state employees:  3 
1.  Current law provides, in the negative, what the laws governing the state civil 4 
service system are not intended to do: limit or res trict the rights of state employees to 5 
bargain collectively.  This bill strikes that language and instead provides, in the positive, 6 
what the laws governing the state civil service system are intended to do: provide a 7 
framework under which collective barga ining can take place;  8 
2.  Current law provides that, except as provided in statute, a position may not be 9 
assigned a salary that is greater than the maximum or lower than the minimum rates fixed 10 
in the compensation plan.  This bill repeals that prohibition ; 11 
3.  It changes the law governing recruitment and retention adjustments to remove the 12 
requirement that, if applicable, the Director of Human Resources within the Department 13 
of Administrative and Financial Services obtain the agreement of the bargaining ag ent; 14 
4.  It amends the law governing the conditions that justify the payment of a 15 
recruitment and retention adjustment by adding as a condition warranting the adjustment 16 
the existence of other documentable recruitment and retention difficulties and elimina ting 17 
as a condition warranting the adjustment the existence of a clear, geographically 18 
definable labor market within which the State must compete;  19 
5.  It specifies that, if a subsequent review of any recruitment and retention 20 
adjustment results in an adjus tment being decreased or discontinued, an affected 21 
employee may not be subject to a reduction in pay;  22 
6.  It eliminates the requirement that, if a funding request is necessary to implement 23 
an approved adjustment, the Director of Human Resources submit the cost items for 24 
inclusion in the Governor's next operating budget within 10 days after action on the report 25 
recommending the adjustment;  26 
7.  It specifies that salary increases within an established range must be based upon 27 
meritorious performance, which is defined as performance that exceeds satisfactory 28 
performance; and  29 
8.  It provides that, in hiring an employee who has not been employed by the 30 
executive branch within the immediately preceding 12 months, an agency may offer and 31 
pay a one -time recruitment b onus to the new employee that is subject to the discretion of 32 
the agency and is removed from collective bargaining.  33
