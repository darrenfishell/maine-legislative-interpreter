SUMMARY  29 
This bill authorizes the Depart ment of Public Safety, Gambling Control Board to 30 
issue 2 casino licenses, one in the southern region of the State, which includes York 31 
County and Cumberland County, and one in the northern region of the State, which 32 
includes Penobscot County, Washington Co unty and Aroostook County.  In order to be 33 
eligible to apply for a casino license, an applicant must be awarded the privilege to 34 
submit an application pursuant to a competitive bidding process.  The competitive 35 
bidding process is administered by a site loc ation commission established by this bill.  36 
The Casino Site Location Commission consists of 5 members appointed by the Governor 37 
subject to review by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 38 
over casino gaming and confirmation by the Senate.  The bill provides that commission 39 
members may not have a conflict of interest and are prohibited from representing or being 40 
 
 Page 13 - 127LR0410(01) -1 
 employed by gambling interests during their term on the commission and for 5 years after 1 
their term ends.  2 
Under the bil l, a successful bidder for a casino in the southern region of the State 3 
must propose a capital investment of at least $250,000,000 exclusive of license fees, land 4 
acquisition and off -site improvements.  The initial fee for a southern region casino is 5 
$5,00 0,000 for a 5 -year license term in addition to a $250,000 application fee and 6 
$100,000 investigative fee.  The renewal fee for a southern region casino is $250,000.  7 
A successful bidder for a casino in the northern region of the State must propose a 8 
minimum  capital investment of $25,000,000 exclusive of license fees, land acquisition 9 
and off -site improvements.  The initial fee for a northern region casino is $1,000,000 for a 10 
5-year license term in addition to a $100,000 application fee and a $100,000 investi gative 11 
fee.  The renewal fee for a northern region casino is $100,000.  12 
The bill provides factors that the commission is directed to consider when reviewing 13 
bids for the privilege to submit an application to operate a casino.  Examples of those 14 
factors incl ude: how the proposal from a bidder will result in the highest potential benefit 15 
to the State based on documented, expert market analyses, the potential of the proposed 16 
facility to serve as a tourism destination and how the proposal will preserve existing jobs 17 
and preserve new full -time jobs in the State.  For a casino bid in the southern region, the 18 
commission must consider the bidder’s experience operating a commercial harness racing 19 
track and how the casino will benefit the harness racing industry and as sociated 20 
businesses.  For the casino bid in the northern region, the commission is directed to 21 
consider how the proposal will provide the greatest benefit to one or all of the federally 22 
recognized Indian tribes in the State, particularly by proposing opera tion and ownership 23 
by one or more of the tribes.  With regard to the location of a northern region casino, the 24 
commission is directed to consider either the proposed facility's proximity to the 25 
Canadian border and major transportation routes or whether it will be located where 26 
gaming is currently conducted by a federally recognized Indian tribe regardless of 27 
whether that facility will be within 30 miles of a casino licensed prior to January 1, 2015.  28 
Finally, the bill provides that the required revenue distr ibutions from casinos licensed 29 
before January 1, 2015 be held by the Gambling Control Board until a uniform 30 
distribution structure of slot machine and table game revenue is enacted by the 31 
Legislature.  32
