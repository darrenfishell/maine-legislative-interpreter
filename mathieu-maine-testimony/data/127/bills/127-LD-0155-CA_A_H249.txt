Legislative Cost/Study 
The general operating expenses of this study are projected to be $2,750 in fiscal year 2015-16. The Legislature's 
proposed budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 for legislative studies. Whether this amount is sufficient to 
fund all studies will depend on the number of studies authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature. The

budgeted staff resources. If more than 4 meetings are held during the interim the estimated cost for each additional 
meeting is projected to be $625 for legislative per diem and expenses. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services from the provisions in this bill are expected to 
be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
