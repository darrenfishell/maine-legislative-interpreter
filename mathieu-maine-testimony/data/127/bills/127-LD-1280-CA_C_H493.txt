12 SUMMARY 
13 This amendment replaces the bill and is a minority report of the committee. The 
14 amendment establishes a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino 
15 in either York County or Cumberland County. The amendment establishes the Casino 
16 Development Commission, which is an independent board of 5 members appointed by 
17 the Govemor and confinned by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
18 r~quest for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Gambling Control 
19 Board for a casino operator license. Prior to submitting a request for proposals, either 
20 York County or Cumberland CQunty, or both, would have to hold a referendum vote 
21 asking voters to allow the operation of a casino in their county. The referendum must 1;>e 
22 held on the same date as a statewide election no sooner than June 1, 2016 and no later 
23 than July 1, 2017. The fee to submit a 1;>id is $250,000. The amendment provides for 
24 specific supporting information to be submitted by the bidder and considered by the 
25 commission inchJding the bidder's ability to make a minimum $250,000,000 capital 
26 investment in the resort-style casino and information regarding job creation, economic; 
27 development, plans to mitigate negative infrastructure impacts and the bidder's support of 
28 the hamess racing indlJstry. Under the amendment, the commission is directed to develop 
29 a point system for the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and give priority to 
30 proposals that create jobs, promote economic development, increase tourism and support 
31 a casino that fits the character of the State. The winning bidder must enter into a contract 
32 with the commission that obligates the casino operator to abide by the proposals made in 
33 the winning bid. Failure to abide by the tenns of the contract could result in fmancial 
34 penalties to the casino operator. 
35 The license fee for a casirio under the amendment is $25,000,000, of which 
36 $5,000,000 is deposited into the General Fund to be used for administrative expenses of 
37 the Gambling Control Board. The remaining $20,000,000 is deposited into an account to 
38 be used to mitigate the impact of lost revenue on the municipalities and a county in which 
39 casinos are currently located. The Gambling Control Board will distribute money from 
40 the account to the municipalities and county based on distributions the municipalities and 
41 county had been receiving from the casino.

If a person initially licensed to operate the casino surrenders the license or the license 
is revoked, a subsequent licensee may operate the casino only for the remainder of the 
license term and is subject to a $500,000 transfer fee. A subsequent licensee is subject to 
the c;ontract executed when the casino in either York County or Cumberland County was 
initially licensed. 
The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine reven\le at 40% and the 
distrih\ltion of net table game revenue at 16% for the resort-style casino. The amendment 
provides for various recipients of slot machine revenue and requires table game revenue 
to be deposited to the F\lnd to Reform Veterans Services, which is established by the 
amendment to facilitate a coordinated delivery system of benefits and services to veterans 
in the State. Upon operation of slot machines at the resort-style casino, the board will 
hold distributions required of existing casinos until the Legislature establishes a single 
distrib\ltion structure that would apply to all casinos in the State. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.

Fiscal Detail and Notes $500 $500 $500· $500 
If York and Washington counties choose to hold referendums during the state primary election in June 2016, 
the Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $11,772 for ballot printing 
costs and postage. If the counties choose to hold referendums during the general election in November 2016, 
the Department of Secretary of State will require a General Fund appropriation of $14,464 for ballot printing 
costs and postage only if the questions require printing a separate ballot. 
The bill establishes the Fund to Reform Veterans Services in the Department of Defense, Veterans and 
Emergency Services with a base Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) allocation of $500 beginning in fiscal 
year 2015-16 in order to allow the department to spend any monies received. 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino. 
Bidders will pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The fiscal note assumes this will 
be credited to the General Fund. The Gambling Control Board (GCB) will accept applications for a casino 
license in either Yo de County or Cumberland County for the winning bidder as long as the voters of the 
municipality where the proposed casino will be located have voted to approve a casino. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 40% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill 
would require this casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital 
improvements to the casino using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct 
those funds to the GCB. This fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the GCB. This 
fiscal note assumes a total of 1,000 slot machines and 24 table games, generating an estimated annual revenue 
of$27,158,628 to the GCB and $1,735,181 to the Fund to Refonn Veterans Services. 
LR1572(04) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
c"e' 0-1 -tfJ3) 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator 
license is $25,000,000, with $5,000,000 going to the General Fund and $20,000,000 going into an OSRF 
account within the GCB. The $20,000,000 will be used to maintain the level of revenue distributed to 
municipalities and counties receiving money from either Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino. Registration 
fees will generate $102,400 in OSRF revenue annually. Annual State costs associated with 5 inspectors, an 
auditor and other related expenses are estimated to be $523,510. 
WhiteS and Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in 
revenue to Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to open. This fiscal note assumes the same 
20% reduction, resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of $347,495 and OSRF revenue 
loss of$5,410,437. An assessment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood Casino has not been 
done at this time. 
Under cunent law, State revenue from both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino go to various funds, but 
this bill directs all State revenue from these casinos to go to the GCB until a distribution of slot machine and 
table game revenue is established by the Legislature. The new distribution is required to be a uniform 
distribution of slot machine and table game revenue for each casino, slot machine facility or gambling 
facility. This will reduce General Fund revenue by an estimated $8,223,744 annually.
