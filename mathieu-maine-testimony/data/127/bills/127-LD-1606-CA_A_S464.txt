5 equivalent rating from a successor publication, or is rated as "NR" or "NA" or a similar 
6 rating by a nationally recognized pricing reference and the drug is not obsolete and is 
7 generally available for purchase in this State. 
8 This Part requires a pharmacy benefits manager to remove or modify in a timely

21 benefits manager. 
22 This Part establishes an appeal process to allow a pharmacy to challenge a drug's 
23 maximum allowable cost under certain conditions.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Part A provides a General Fund appropriation of $931,283 in fiscal year 2016-17 to increase wages for selected 
positions at state mental health facilities. Part A also includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of 
$1,652,208 for the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) match for these costs. 
Part B provides a General Fund appropriation of $4,000,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 for rate increases for personal 
support and related services. Part B also includes Federal Expenditures Fund allocations required for the FMAP 
match. 
Part C authorizes the use of funds in the Salary Plan program, up to $939,883 in fiscal year 2015-16 and up to 
$6,088,514 in fiscal year 2016-17 to provide pay increases for certain law enforcement employees. 
Part D provides a General Fund appropriation of $2,465,896 in fiscal year 2015-16 for the County Jail Operations 
Fund within the Department of Corrections. 
Part E will increase costs to the State Employee Health Plan due to the change in the maximum allowable costs list 
rules for pharmacy benefits managers for contracts beginning on or after September 1, 2016. The bill would not have 
any impact on the current biennial budget since the State's contract with a pharmacy benefits manager ends on June 
30, 2017. Moving forward it is estimated that there will be an annual cost of$97,155 to the General Fund and $3,244 
to the Highway Fund for contributions to the costs of the State Employee Health Plan. 
LR2716(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 2 of3 
Part F provides General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of$483,003 in fiscal 
year 2015-16 and $1,853,075 in fiscal year 2016-17 and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $92,499 in fiscal 
year 2015-16 and $369,999 in fiscal year 2016-17 for additional payments to MaineCare providers who are subject to 
Maine's Service Provider Tax. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations are also included for the FMAP match. 
Part G provides that consolidated loans are eligible for the educational opportunity tax credit in tax year 2015 
provided that the consolidated loans only include educational loans. This would reduce General Fund revenue by 
$24,500 in fiscal year 2015-16 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue by $500 in fiscal year 2015-16. 
Part H expands the educational opportunity tax credit and would reduce General Fund and Local Government Fund 
revenue by $395,200 and $8,000, respectively, in fiscal year 2016-17. 
Part I transfers $44,500,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the Maine 
Budget Stabilization Fund.
