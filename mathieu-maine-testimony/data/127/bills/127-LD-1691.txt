A.  For the purposes of this subsection, the Director of the Bureau of Forestry or the 21 
director's designee may:  22 
(1)  With appropriate notification to the landowner, enter and examine forest land 23 
for the purpose of determining compliance with the forest management and 24 
harvest plan pursuant to sect ion 574 -B; 25

pursuant to this subsection is confidential and is not a public record as defined in Title 1, 3 
section 402, subsection 3, except that the director may publish at least one summary 4 
report annually, which may not reveal the activities of any person  and that is available as 5 
a public record.  6 
This subsection is repealed on March 31, 2020.  7 
Sec. 8.  36 MRSA §578, sub -§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 404, §1, is further 8 
amended to read:  9 
1.  Organized areas.   The municipal assessors or chief assessor of a pri mary 10 
assessing area shall adjust the State Tax Assessor's 100% valuation per acre for each 11 
forest type of their county by whatever ratio, or percentage of current just value, is 12 
applied to other property within the municipality to obtain the assessed value s.  Forest 13 
land in the organized areas, subject to taxation under this subchapter, must be taxed at the 14 
property tax rate applicable to other property in the municipality.  15 
The State Tax Assessor shall determine annually the amount of acreage in each 16 
munici pality that is classified and taxed in accordance with this subchapter.  Each 17 
municipality is entitled to annual payments distributed in accordance with this section 18 
from money appropriated by the Legislature if it submits an annual return in accordance 19 
with section 383 and if it achieves the minimum assessment ratio established in section 20 
327.  The State Tax Assessor shall pay any municipal claim found to be in satisfactory 21 
form by August 1st of the year following the submission of the annual return.  The 22 
municipal reimbursement appropriation is calculated on the basis of 90% of the per acre 23 
tax revenue lost as a result of this subchapter.  For property tax years based on the status 24 
of property on April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2009, municipal reimbursement und er this 25 
section is further limited to the amount appropriated by the Legislature and distributed on 26 
a pro rata basis by the State Tax Assessor for all timely filed claims.  For purposes of this 27 
section, "classified forest lands" means forest lands classifi ed pursuant to this subchapter 28 
as well as all areas identified as forested land within farmland parcels that are transferred 29 
from tree growth classification pursuant to section 1112 on or after October 1, 2011. For 30 
the purposes of this section, the tax los t is the tax that would have been assessed, but for 31 
this subchapter, on the classified forest lands if they were assessed according to the 32 
undeveloped acreage valuations used in the state valuation then in effect, or according to 33 
the current local valuatio n on undeveloped acreage, whichever is less, minus the tax that 34 
was actually assessed on the same lands in accordance with this subchapter, and adjusted 35 
for the aggregate municipal savings in required educational costs attributable to reduced 36 
state valuati on.  A municipality that fails to achieve the minimum assessment ratio 37 
established in section 327 loses 10% of the reimbursement provided by this section for 38 
each one percentage point the minimum assessment ratio falls below the ratio established 39 
in sectio n 327.  The State Tax Assessor may not make payment pursuant to this 40 
subchapter to a municipality in the year following notification by the Bureau of Forestry 41 
that the municipality has failed to remove a parcel from enrollment under this subchapter 42 
pursuan t to the requirements under section 575 -A, subsection 3.  43 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR2745(01) -1 
 The State Tax Assessor shall adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of this 1 
section.  Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules for the 2 
purposes of Title 5, cha pter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 3 
C.  The State Tax Assessor shall distribute reimbursement under this section to each 4 
municipality in proportion to the product of the reduced tree growth valuation of the 5 
municipality multiplied by the property tax burden of the m unicipality.  For purposes 6 
of this paragraph, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms have the 7 
following meanings.  8 
(1)  "Property tax burden" means the total real and personal property taxes 9 
assessed in the most recently completed munic ipal fiscal year, except the taxes 10 
assessed on captured value within a tax increment financing district, divided by 11 
the latest state valuation certified to the Secretary of State.  12 
(2)  "Undeveloped land" means rear acreage and unimproved nonwaterfront 13 
acreage that is not:  14 
(a)  Classified under the laws governing current use valuation set forth in 15 
chapter 105, subchapter 2 -A, 10 or 10 -A; 16 
(b)  A base lot; or  17 
(c)  Waste land.  18 
(3)  "Average value of undeveloped land" means the per acre undeveloped land 19 
valuatio ns used in the state valuation then in effect, or according to the current 20 
local valuation on undeveloped land as determined for state valuation purposes, 21 
whichever is less.  22 
(4)  "Reduced tree growth valuation" means the difference between the average 23 
value of undeveloped land and the average value of tree growth land times the 24 
total number of acres classified as forest land under this subchapter plus the total 25 
number of acres of forest land that is transferred from tree growth classification 26 
to farmland cl assification pursuant to section 1112 on or after October 1, 2011.  27 
Sec. 9.  36 MRSA §581, sub -§2-A is enacted to read:  28

value on the date of withdrawal, less all taxes paid on that parcel over the 7 
preceding 5 years or the number of tax years starting with the year in which the 8 
property was first classified, whichever is less, and interest at the legal r ate from 9 
the date or dates on which those amounts would have been payable.  10

SUMMARY  25 
This bill makes the following changes to the Maine Tree Growth Tax L aw. 26 
1.  It includes harvesting as an expressly stated activity for land in the Maine Tree 27 
Growth Tax Law program.  28 
2.  It removes certain items from the definition of "forest products that have 29 
commercial value" under the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law program.  30 
3.  It increases the minimum parcel size from 10 acres to 25 acres for the Maine Tree 31 
Growth Tax Law program for parcels enrolled on or after April 1, 2017.  It disqualifies 32 
from participation in the program any parcel of land that is located within 10 mil es of the 33 
Atlantic Ocean, beginning April 1, 2017.  In the case of a sale or other transfer of 34 
qualifying parcels occurring on or after April 1, 2017, it requires the withdrawal of any 35 
resulting parcels of less than 25 acres. It provides an alternative met hod for withdrawal 36 
from the program for parcels smaller than 25 acres for the 2017 tax year and allows for 37 
the owners of parcels to apply for classification under the open space land laws.  38 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR2745(01) -1 
 4. It authorizes the Bureau of Forestry in the Department of Agricu lture, 1 
Conservation and Forestry to audit parcels of land enrolled in the Maine Tree Growth Tax 2 
Law program to ensure compliance of the landowner with the requirements of the 3 
program and that the parcel is being managed in substantial compliance with the f orest 4 
management and harvest plan for that parcel.  The bureau is required to order the removal 5 
from the program of any parcel that is not substantially compliant with the requirements 6 
of the program.  7 
5.  It requires the State Tax Assessor to deny reimburs ement to a municipality if any 8 
parcel of land enrolled in the Maine Tree Growth Tax Law program is not compliant with 9 
the program.  10 
This bill also enacts a credit for certain individuals that harvest trees on Maine land.  11 
An individual who owns 25 acres or less or 100 acres or more of Maine land does not 12 
qualify for the credit.  The harvesting of trees on Maine land owned by a corporation or a 13 
pass-through entity does not qualify for the credit.  The credit is equal to 8% of the gain 14 
associated with the harv esting of the trees to the extent the gain is included in the 15 
taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income.  The credit is not refundable and any unused 16 
credit amount may not be carried to any other tax year.  The credit applies to tax years 17 
beginning on or af ter January 1, 2016.  18
