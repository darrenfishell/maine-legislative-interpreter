Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Making it easier for a parent to block a change proposed by a school administrative unit (SAU) to a child's special 
education services and requiring SAD's to initiate a more costly dispute resolution process may result in increased 
costs to the Department of Education, who provides the dispute resolution services, andlor local school administrative 
units dliC to a potential increase in the number of higher cost mediation andlor hearing requests and a decrease in the 
number of lower cost complaint investigations from what currently occurs. 
Under current law, a parent can only block a change in their child's special education services by requesting a 
complaint investigation, mediation or a hearing. According to the Department of Education, the complaint 
investigation is the least expensive of the 3 options. However, federal law only allows for parents to request a 
complaint investigation and is not an option for local SAD's. The Department of Education estimates that, had this 
provision been in place during fiscal year 2013-14, the additional cost would have been approximately $95,000. This 
estimate assumes an additional cost of conducting a hearing versus a complaint investigation to be approximately 
$5,000 per request and is based on 19 requests for complaint investigations during that year. The impact to the 
Department and local SAD's will depend on actual experience.
