Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation requires a voter to show valid photographic identification before voting. The bill includes a General 
Fund appropriation of $362,235 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $71,645 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of 
Secretary of State to produce state identification cards for voters who do not have another valid photographic 
identification, modify the state identification card application to add an attestation statement and print provisional 
ballot envelopes and ballot affidavits. There are currently 235,207 individuals 18 or over who do not have a driver's 
license or state identification card. This analysis assumes 73% of these individuals (the average percentage of 
registered voters who voted in the last 3 presidential elections) would choose to vote and that 60% of these individuals 
would need a free identification card.
