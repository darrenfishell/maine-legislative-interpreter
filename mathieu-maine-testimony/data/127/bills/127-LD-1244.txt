application.  If an interested person requests that the commissioner refer an 7 
applica tion to the board and the commissioner determines that the criteria are not 8 
met, the commissioner shall notify the board of that request.  If at any subsequent 9 
time during the review of an application the commissioner decides that the 10 
application falls und er section 341 -D, subsection 2, the commissioner shall request 11 
that the board assume jurisdiction of the application.  12 
(1)  The commissioner may not request the board to assume jurisdiction of an 13 
application for any permit or other approval required for an expedited wind 14 
energy development, as defined in Title 35 -A, section 3451, subsection 4, a 15 
certification pursuant to Title 35 -A, section 3456 or a general permit pursuant to 16 
section 480 -HH or section 636 -A.  Except as provided in subparagraph (2), the 17 
comm issioner shall issue a decision on an application for an expedited wind 18 
energy development within one year of the date on which the department accepts 19 
the application as complete pursuant to this section , and the commissioner shall 20 
issue a decision for  an offshore wind power project or a hydropower project, as 21 
defined in section 632, subsection 3, that uses tidal action as a source of electrical 22 
or mechanical power within 185 days of the date on which the department 23 
accepts the application as complete pursu ant to this section or within 270 days of 24

from a water utility having the right to withdraw water from the body of water for which 27 
the water level regime is sought,  or, in cases where a public water supply is threatened, at 28 
the reques t of a water utility having the right to withdraw water from the body of water 29 
for which the water level regime is sought,  conduct an adjudicatory hearing for the 30 
purpose of establishing a water level regime and, if applicable, minimum flow 31 
requirements fo r the body of water impounded by any dam that is not:  32 
A.  Operating with a license or exemption issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory 33 
Commission or determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be 34 
subject to the jurisdiction of that commissio n; 35 
D.  Operating with a permit setting water levels issued under the protection of natural 36 
resources laws, sections 480 -A to 480 -S; the site location of development laws, 37 
sections 481 to 489 -E; the small hydroelectric generating facilities laws, sections 6 31 38 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR0540(01) -1 
 to 636; the land use regulation laws, Title 12, sections 681 to 689; or any other statute 1 
regulating the construction or operation of dams;  2

issued pursuant to this section or former Title 12, section 304, the commissioner is not 8 
required to hold a hearing to establish a new water level regime or minimum flow 9 
requirement  requirements  for the same body of water in response to a petition from 10 
littora l or riparian proprietors unless the commissioner determines that there has been a 11 
substantial change in conditions or other circumstances materially affecting the impact of 12 
water levels and minimum flows on the public and private resources identified in 13 
subsection 4 since the order was issued.  14 
Sec. 11.  38 MRSA §840, sub -§1-A is enacted to read:  15 
1-A.  Petition.  Upon receipt of a petition from 25% or 50 of the littoral or riparian 16 
proprietors, whichever is less, or from a water utility having the right to withdraw water 17 
from the body of water for which the water level regime and, if applicable, minimum 18 
flow requirements are sought, or at the request of the owner, lessee or person in control of 19 
a dam, the department shall review any submissions to determine the standing of any 20 
group or individual making such petition or request, and to determine the eligibility of the 21 
dam and body of water for regulation under the criteria in subsection 1.  22 
A.  Prior to the department's initiating a hearing for establishing a water level regime 23 
and, if applicable, minimum flow requirements in response to a petition or request 24 
under this subsection, the parties named in the petition or request must attempt to 25 
establish a water level management plan through mediation by an indepe ndent 3rd - 26 
party mediator.  The department is not required to take part in the mediation.  The 27 
department shall place the request or petition to establish a water level regime and, if 28 
applicable, minimum flow requirements on hold for a period of up to one y ear from 29 
the date of acceptance to allow mediation to occur.  The on -hold period may be 30 
extended upon written agreement between all parties to a petition or request and the 31 
department.  If mediation results in a water level management plan acceptable to al l 32 
parties to a petition or request, that water level management plan must be recorded at 33 
the appropriate registry of deeds and is binding and civilly enforceable on the 34 
affected parties, unless and until the department issues a subsequent order 35 
establishin g a water level regime and, if applicable, minimum flow requirements for 36 
the body of water in question.  Establishment of a water level management plan 37 
through mediation relieves the department of any obligation it has to hold an 38 
adjudicatory hearing and i ssue an order in response to a petition or request, and the 39 
department shall return the petition or request to the submittor.  40 
B.  A petition or request under this subsection for establishing a water level regime 41 
and, if applicable, minimum flow requirement s must be accompanied by a processing 42 
fee established by the department.  If the department holds an adjudicatory hearing as 43 
a result of a petition or request, the department may charge petitioners or requestors 44 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0540(01) -1 
 an appropriate licensing fee sufficient to c over costs incurred in conducting the 1 
hearing and reviewing evidence, including the time spent by state employees and 2 
necessary consultants and contractors in preparing, presenting and reviewing 3 
testimony, and in preparation of a department order establish ing a water level regime 4 
and, if applicable, minimum flow requirements.  All fees must be established in 5 
accordance with section 352.  6 
SUMMARY  7 
This bill requires the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to issue a decision 8 
on an application for an exped ited wind energy development within one year of the date 9 
the department accepts the application as complete.  It repeals procedures related to the 10 
review of an application for a grid -scale wind energy development.  It provides 11 
permitting requirements for s mall-scale wind energy developments.  It requires parties to 12 
a water level dispute to attempt to resolve the matter through mediation before the 13 
department proceeds with an adjudicatory hearing.  It establishes standards for 14 
microhydropower projects and re quires the department to adopt rules ensuring that a 15 
microhydropower project will not have an undue adverse effect on the natural 16 
environment and will not violate water quality standards.  17
