This bill includes General Fund appropriations totaling $22,567 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $36,138 in fiscal year 2016-
17 to implement the requirements of this legislation. Of this amount, General Fund appropriations of $12,567 in fisca~ 
year 2015-16 and $26,138 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Bureau of Labor Standards is included for a portion of the 
personal services cost for one Labor and Safety Inspector position associated with enforcing the notification 
requirements and collecting the fines assessed. Additionally, General Fund appropriations of $1 0,000 in fiscal years 
2015-16 and 2016-17 to the Workforce Research program is included for the maintenance of a database of employers 
who have relocated a call center or a facility or operating unit handling at least 30% of call volume within a call 
center, from the State to a foreign country. This fiscal note assumes a January 1, 2016 effective date. 
Requiring those employers that have received state grants, state guaranteed loans or state tax benefits and have 
relocated a call center, or one or more facilities or operating units within a call center handling at least 30% of the call 
center's total call volume, from the State to a foreign country to remit the unamortized value of the state grant, state 
guaranteed loan or tax benefit may result in increased General Fund or Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to the 
State beginning in fiscal year 2015-16. Assessing a fine of$350 for each day that an employer fails to notifY the State 
of its intention to relocate a call center may also increase General Fund revenues beginning in fiscal year 2015-16. 
The amount of additional revenue to be received will depend on the number of fines assessed and the value of the 
grants, loans or tax benefits remitted. 
The Department of Administrative and Financial Services anticipates additional costs associated with this bill. These 
are not anticipated to be significant.
