receive Department of Health and Human Services records and information concerning 35 
the child unless the department can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 36

may be in Department of Health and Human Services records if the person obtained that 2 
information from an independent source.  3 
4.  It clarifies that unsubstantiated records or information that are expunged or should 4 
have been expunged may not be used for any purpose including as evidence in any 5 
administrative or judicial proceeding.  6 
5.  It modifies the notice, conduct and appeal rights concerning proceedings involving 7 
preliminary protection  orders.  8 
6.  It clarifies that the petitioner must present and the court must find that reasonable 9

preliminary protection order.  11
