Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium revenue increase -Efficiency Maine Trust 
Minor cost increase -Efficiency Maine Trust 
Under current law, starting in fiscal year 2016-17, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) must ensure that 
transmission and distribution utilities receiving settlement funds from litigation related to the decommissioning costs 
of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company are to be distributed in a manner that provides maximum benefit to the 
economy. Under this bill, from fiscal year 2016-17 through fiscal year 2019-20, 50% of these settlement funds would 
be directed to the Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT) to assist low-income residential electric utility customers in making 
certain energy efficiency improvements and upgrades. The remaining 50% of settlement funds would be used to 
reduce the utility rates of transmission and distribution utilities in a manner providing maximum benefit to the 
economy, with the percentage rising to 100% of settlement funds in fiscal year 2020-21 and in every subsequent fiscal 
year. The PUC has indicated that the amount of settlement funds, or whether there will be any settlement funds, in 
fiscal year 2016-17 and beyond cannot currently be detennined. 
Any additional costs to the EMT are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
