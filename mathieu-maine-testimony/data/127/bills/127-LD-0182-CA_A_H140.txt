127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 140, L.D. 182, Bill, "An Act To 
Eliminate Term Limits for Legislators" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Increase the Number of Terms a Legislator May Serve' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §553, sub-§§1 and 2, as enacted by IB 1993, c. 1, §1 and 
affected by §2, are amended to read: 
1. State Senate. A person may not serve more than -4-Q consecutive terms as a state 
State Senator or more than 12 consecutive years, whichever is less in duration. 
2. State Representative. A person may not serve more than -4-Q consecutive terms 
as a member of the state State House of Representatives or more than 12 consecutive 
years, whichever is less in duration.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. It replaces the bill and 
instead increases the amount of time that a State Senator and State Representative may 
serve from 4 consecutive terms, as in current law, to 6 consecutive terms or 12 
consecutive years, whichever is less in duration.
