SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the majority report of the committee. It specifies that the 
3 Department of Health and Human Services must hire 5 new state-certified health 
4 inspectors, instead of a sufficient number of inspectors as proposed in the resolve, and 
5 clarifies that the additional inspectors are to be hired for the purpose of inspecting each 
6 licensed establishment in this State pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22, 
7 section 2497. The amendment keeps the requirement that directs the department to report 
8 to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services regarding the cost of the 
9 new health inspectors and adds a requirement that the department report on whether it is 
10 meeting the inspection requirements of Title 22, section 2497. The amendment also adds
