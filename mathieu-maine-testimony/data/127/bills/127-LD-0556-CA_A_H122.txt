Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation requires public schools to offer training to students in how to perf om cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) and use automated external defibrillators (AEDs). This bill also requires the Department of Education to 
establish, by rule, standards for instruction in performing CPR and using AEDs and to design the rules in such a way 
that a public school is not required to expand or modify its activity so as to necessitate additional expenditures from 
local revenues. This preliminary fiscal impact statement assumes that the rules developed and adopted by the 
department will allow for the use of existing training tools available at no cost through the American Heart Associaton 
and other organizations and will not require the purchase of AED's or other training equipment. If that happens, any 
costs associated with implementing this legislation can be absorbed by the department within its existing budgeted 
resources.
