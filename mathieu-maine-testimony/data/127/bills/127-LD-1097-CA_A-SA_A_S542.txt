This amendment makes the following changes to Committee Amendment "A": 
1. It removes the requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services 
establish a system to electronically block the purchase of certain products and services at 
the point of sale using the electronic benefits transfer system, or "EBT system"; 
2. It requires the department to find by clear and convincing documentary evidence 
that the individual knowingly purchased prohibited items using the EBT system and 
limits recovery by the department to the amount allowed under current law regarding 
recovery ofTANF benefits; 
3. It changes the penalty imposed for using the EBT system to purchase prohibited 
items by imposing a 3-month disqualification from receiving benefits for a first offense 
and increases the penalty for a 2nd offense to a 12-month disqualification and to a 24-
month disqualification for a 3rd and subsequent offense; 
4. It requires the department to initiate an administrative hearing if the department 
finds that a recipient of benefits has used the EBT system to purchase prohibited items 
and requires the notice and hearing to be conducted consistent with the department rules 
governing notice and hearing for an intentional program violation; 
5. It changes the name of the implementation committee, which is responsible for 
determining options for preventing the use of the EBT system for prohibited purchases, to 
the feasibility working group and removes the authority of that group to provide advice to 
the Commissioner of Health and Human Services with respect to the development of 
rules regarding the EBT system; and
