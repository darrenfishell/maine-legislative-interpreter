during that part of the taxable year that the qualified individual worked in this State.  16 
Payment of loan amounts in excess of the amounts due during the taxable year does 17 
not qualify for the credit.  Refinanced loans or consolidated loans that are part of the 18

section if the refinanced loans remain separate from other debt, including debt 20 
incurred in an educational program other than the degree program for which a credit 21 
is claimed but only in proportion to the portion of the loan payments that are 22 
otherwise eligible under this section.  Forbearance or deferment of loan payments 23 
does not affect eligibility for the credit under this section.  For tax years beginning on 24 
or after January 1, 2015, an individual who worked in this State for any part of a 25 
month during the Maine residency period of the taxable year is considered to have 26 
worked in this State for the entire month.  For tax years beginning on or after January 27
