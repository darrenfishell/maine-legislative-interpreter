SUBCHAPTER 3 -B 3 
GENETICALLY ENGINEER ED PRODUCTS  4 
ยง6116.  Labeling of genetically engineered marine organisms  5 
1.  Labeling prohibition.  Begi nning January 1, 2016, a marine organism that has 6 
been, in whole or in part, genetically engineered may not be offered for sale for human 7 
consumption if labeled with the same name as its nongenetically engineered counterpart 8 
unless the words "genetically e ngineered" appear immediately before the name in the 9 
same size, color and font type.  For purposes of this section, "genetically engineered" 10 
means modified by recombinant DNA techniques or containing such a modification as 11 
the result of inheritance.  12 
2.  Violation; penalty.  Failure to comply with this section is a civil violation for 13 
which a fine of not more than $1,500 may be adjudged.  14 
SUMMARY  15 
This bill requires clear and conspicuous labeling of a marine organism offered for 16 
sale if the marine organism is produced using genetic engineering and is labeled with the 17 
same name as its nongenetically engineered counterpart.  Failure to provide the required 18 
labeling is a civil violation.  19
