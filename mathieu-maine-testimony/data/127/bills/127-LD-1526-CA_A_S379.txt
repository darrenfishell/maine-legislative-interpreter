obtained pursuant to this subsection are maintained in accordance with this 
subsection; and 
F. Shall indemnify and hold harmless criminal justice agencies providing 
information pursuant to this subsection with respect to any litigation that may result 
from the provision of the information to the person.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and changes the title. Current law allows a criminal 
justice agency to disclose intelligence and investigative record information to a sexual 
assault counselor or an advocate for victims of domestic or family violence if a specific 
agreement exists between the counselor or advocate and the agency and the agreement 
contains terms provided in the statute. The amendment repeals these provisions and 
instead places into law a list of requirements that must be met by a sexual assault 
counselor or an advocate that receives intelligence and investigative record information 
from a criminal justice agency.
