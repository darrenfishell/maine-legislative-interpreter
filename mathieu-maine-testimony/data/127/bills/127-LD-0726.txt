SUMMARY  8

1.  It increases the amount of excess prepared marijuana a registered primary 10 
caregiver may transfer for reasonable compensation in a calendar year from 2 pounds to 5 11 
pounds;  12 
2.  It specifies that, like registered dispensaries, a primary caregiver's cultivation 13 
facility is subject to reasonable inspection by the Department of Health a nd Human 14 
Services at any time, without prior notice;  15 
3. It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt routine 16 
technical rules governing the manner in which the department considers an application 17 
for and a renewal of a registry identific ation card for a primary caregiver;  18 
4.  It clarifies that the information provided by the Department of Health and Human 19 
Services to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Revenue 20 
Services may be used by the bureau to determine whether an applicant for a license or 21 
renewal of a license as a registered dispensary has complied with the tax laws; and  22 
5.  It specifies that the Medical Use of Marijuana Fund may be used by the 23 
Department of Health and Human Services for enforcement pur poses that are primarily 24
