 SUMMARY 1 
This bill regulates unmanned aerial vehicles, including their acquisition and lawful 2 
operation by law enforcement agencies.  The bill requires approval of the acquisition of 3 
an unmanned aerial vehicle by the governing body overseeing the law enforcement 4 
agency.  It prohibits a law enforcement agency from operating an unmanned aerial 5

of an unmanned aerial vehicle except pursuant to an emergency enforcement or 7 
administrative investigation exception, with the written consent of the person or property 8 
owner, pursuant to a warrant or pursuant to a court order.  It permits the deployment of an 9 
unmanned aerial vehicle or any component parts by a manufacturer, subcontractor of a 10 
manufacturer, testing company or educational institution for the purposes of research, 11 
testing, training and manufacture of such vehicles.  The bill also creates a private right of 12 
action against a law enforcement agency for violations of the provisions of the bill. 13
