This bill expands eligibility for the educational oppOliunity tax credit to persons graduating from non-Maine colleges, 
to cover graduate degrees and to permit coverage of refinanced or consolidated loans. It would result in a loss of 
General Fund revenue of 304,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 and a loss of Local Government Fund revenue of $16,000 in 
fiscal year 2016-17. The revenue loss will increase significantly for a period of approximately 15 years after fiscal 
year 2018-19 as new graduates become eligible, loan repayment deferments end and taxpayers claim credit 
carryforwards. The bil1 includes General Fund appropriations to the Bureau of Maine Revenue Services of $40,452 in 
fiscal year 2016-17 and $76,782 annually thereafter for one Tax Examiner position and related costs to review and 
process additional claims for the tax credit.
