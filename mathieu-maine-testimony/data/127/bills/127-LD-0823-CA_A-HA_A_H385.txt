11 This amendment amends Committee Amendment "A" to remove the requirement that 
12 the State Police establish a centralized database containing information about concealed 
13 handgun permit holders and applicants for concealed handgun permits. 
14 This amendment also requires the Chief of the State Police to enter into reciprocity 
15 agreements with other states regarding recognition of concealed handgun pennits. Public 
16 Law 2015, chapter 144 requires Maine to recognize a permit to carry a concealed 
17 handgun issued by another state. This amendment does not affect that.
