Fiscal Detail and Notes 
To the extent that this legislation results in the purchaser of an existing business being assigned a lower 
unemployment tax rate than what would have been assigned absent this legislation, there is a loss of revenue to the 
Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. The impact to the fund will depend on actual experience. According to 
the Department of Labor, of the 663 successor determinations in 2014 a maximum of 87 would have qualified for the 
options provided in this legislation.
