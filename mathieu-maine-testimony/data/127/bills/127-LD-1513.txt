 SUMMARY  1 
This bill clarifies language regarding ownership interest, financial interest or control 2 
of generation or generation -related assets by an in vestor -owned transmission and 3 
distribution utility.  4 
This bill also allows the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules to allow an 5 
investor -owned transmission and distribution utility to have an interest in a generation 6 
affiliate as long as that interest  is not a financial interest sufficient to produce incentives 7 
for favoritism that would undermine the purposes of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 8 
35-A, chapter 32. This bill allows the commission to adopt major substantive rules that 9 
establish minimum st andards necessary to protect ratepayers and standards of conduct 10 
that govern the relationship between an investor -owned transmission and distribution 11 
utility and a generation affiliate. This bill requires that standards of conduct adopted by 12 
commission rul e ensure at a minimum that a generation affiliate is not given preference 13 
over nonaffiliated competitive generators; employees of an investor -owned transmission 14 
and distribution utility are physically separated from and not shared with those of a 15 
generatio n affiliate; the books of accounts and records of an investor -owned transmission 16 
and distribution utility and a generation affiliate are separate and are subject to review by 17 
the commission; and an investor -owned transmission and distribution utility does not 18 
subsidize the business of a generation affiliate at the expense of the ratepayer.  19 
This bill defines "generation affiliate" as an affiliate of an investor -owned 20 
transmission and distribution utility that owns or controls generation or generation -related  21 
assets.  22
