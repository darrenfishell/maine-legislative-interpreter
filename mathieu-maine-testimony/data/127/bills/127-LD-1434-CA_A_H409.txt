The hospital may provide this information only if the request from law enforcement 
is consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

federal privacy regulations for drug and alcohol abuse patients, 42 Code of Federal

action arising out of the hospital's compliance with this law. No cause of action against 
the hospital is created for failure to provide the access or information.
