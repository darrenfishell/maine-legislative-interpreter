Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This floor amendment removes the constitutional referendum from the bill and therefore would result in a General 
Fund savings related to eliminating any referendum costs, including any potential need for a second ballot in the 
November 2015 general election. 
Additional costs to the Department of Secretary of State, the Legislature and the Maine State Library associated with 
making the Articles of Separation from Massachusetts, including the fifth subsection, more prominently available to 
the public can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
