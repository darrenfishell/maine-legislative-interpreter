Session of the 128th Legislature. 
Sec. 6. Contingent effective date. That section of this Act that enacts the Maine

proposed configuration and weight can be safely operated on the proposed route of travel. 
The Commissioner of Transportation shall notify the Secretary of Senate, the Clerk of the 
House of Representatives and the Revisor of Statutes when the chief engineer of the

Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment changes the bill by removing language allowing 3-axle truck 
tractors with 4-axle semitrailers of no more than 122,380 pounds total to travel from the 
United States-Canada border in Calais, Madawaska and Van Buren to certain points 
within the State. 
The amendment allows certain commercial vehicles with a 7-axle configuration to 
travel from the United States-Canada border in Calais to Woodland Pulp LLC mill or its 
successor and the former oriented strand board facility in Baileyville. The amendment 
provides that this allowance does not take effect unless the chief engineer of the 
Department of Transportation conducts an analysis and determines that commercial 
vehicles of the proposed configuration and weight can be safely operated on the proposed 
routes of travel. The amendment repeals the allowance on January 1, 2018. The 
amendment requires the Department of Transportation to monitor and evaluate the effects 
of this allowance on road conditions and to report to the joint standing committee of the 
Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters during the Second Regular 
Session of the 127th Legislature and the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature. 
The amendment provides that the joint standing committee has authority to submit a bill 
during the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature regarding the subject matter of 
the report. The amendment adds an emergency preamble and emergency clause to the 
bill. 
The amendment revises the authorized route of travel in the Town of Van Buren in 
the current law allowing certain commercial vehicles at Canadian weight limits to travel 
from the United States-Canada border to certain points in the State. 
Current law authorizes the Department of Transportation to adopt rules, in 
consultation with the Department of Public Safety and the Department of the Secretary of 
State, that allow certain commercial motor vehicles that exceed gross vehicle weight 
limits and vehicle dimension standards established in statute to travel upon designated 
routes. The amendment repeals the exclusion from the commercial motor vehicle 
configurations that may be allowed to operate on specified routes of travel by the

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Allowing certain commercial vehicles with a 7-axle configuration to travel at a gross vehicle weight of 113,800 
pounds could result in damage to the infrastructure leading to an increase in costs for repairing the affected road or 
bridge. Any truck allowed to exceed gross vehicle weight limits would need to obtain a credential from the Secretary 
of State. The Commissioner of Transportation would determine the fee by rule and it would be set to cover 
administrative costs, compliance monitoring and the additional cost of highway damage resulting from this allowance.
