375, subchapter 2 -A, for the administration and the enforcement of laws regulating and 14

contracted out to an entity outside the bureau. The rules may not prohibit the operation of 17

require such  a high investment of risk, money, time or other resource or asset that the 22 
operation of a marijuana establishment or a marijuana transportation provider is not 23

Notwithstanding  the limits on retail marijuana stores specified in Title 28 -A, section 25 
2603, subsection 8, until the initial rules of the bureau have been reviewed by the 26
