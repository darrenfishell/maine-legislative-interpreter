Sec. D -2.  Rulemaking.   By January 31, 2018, the Department of Administrative 11

375, subchapter 2 -A, for the administration and the enforcement of laws regulating and 14 
licensing marijuana establishments and marijuana transportation providers pursuant to 15 
Title 28 -A, chapter 111. The rules must be developed by the bureau and may not be 16 
contracted out to an entity outside the bureau. The rules may not prohibit the operation of 17 
marijuana establishments and marijuana transportation providers, either expressly or 18

transportation providers unreasonably impracticable. As used in this section, 20 
"unreasonably impracticable" means that the measures necessary to comply with the rules 21 
require such  a high investment of risk, money, time or other resource or asset that the 22 
operation of a marijuana establishment or a marijuana transportation provider is not 23 
worthy of being carried out in practice by a reasonably prudent businessperson. 24 
Notwithstanding  the limits on retail marijuana stores specified in Title 28 -A, section 25 
2603, subsection 8, until the initial rules of the bureau have been reviewed by the 26 
Legislature, the bureau may issue one license per municipality, but must issue one per 27
