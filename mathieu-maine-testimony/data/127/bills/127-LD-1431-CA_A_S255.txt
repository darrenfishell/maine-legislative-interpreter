Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Increasing the Finance Authority of Maine's revenue obligation securities limit by $500,000,000 extends the moral 
obligation of the State. 
This bill includesallocations of $71,360 in fIscal year 2015-16 and $96,370 in fiscal year 2015-17 to the Competitive 
Skills Scholarship Program within the Department of Labor for one Program Manager Employment and Training 
position and related costs associated with expanding eligibility for funding available under the Competitive Skills 
Scholarship Program to include a qualified transfonuational expansion project business. This legislation may also 
result in less money being available for education and training for eligible individuals pursuant to Title 26, §2033, sub­
§5. The impact will depend on the number of qualified transfonuational expansion project businesses that take 
advantage of this provision. 
Given the p.arameters that need to be met in tenus of investment and number of employees hired, as well as the 
benefits under the Pine Tree Development Zone program as established in current statute, it is estimated that any 
reduction in sales and use and income tax revenue through fiscal year 2018-19 would be minor and that more 
significant reduction would occur in later years.

Under CUlTent law, the Efficiency Maine Tmst (EMT) must transfer 15% offunds received in the Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative Tmst Fund in fiscal years 2014-15 and 2015-16 to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 
to be disbursed to ratepayers. Under this bill, these funds will also be used to make disbursements to certain qualified 
business projects. Any additional costs to the PUC and EMT are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources. 
The Department of the Attomey General may require additional General Fund appropriations for litigation costs 
resulting from this bill. No estimate of this cost is made at this time. 
Additional costs to the Department of Economic and Community Development associated with the certification 
process can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
