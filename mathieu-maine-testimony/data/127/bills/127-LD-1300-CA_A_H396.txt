This legislation allows a business owner to subtract from taxable income the gain recognized when transferring a 
business to an employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owner cooperative and would reduce General Fund 
revenue by $76,000 beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 and reduce Local Government Fund revenue by $4,000 
begimling in fiscal year 2016-17. The bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation to the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services of $11,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 for computer programming charges. 
This legislation allows costs to the Finance Authority of Maine to maintain, service and administer the Cooperative 
Development Grants Fund to be paid by the fund. Therefore, no General Fund appropriations to FAME are required. 
Additional costs to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF), the Department of Labor, the 
Department of Economic and Community Development and the University of Maine System to identify and make best 
efforts to pursue federal sources of funding for the development of cooperatives and employee ownership can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources. Additional costs to ACF to ensure that ACF programs provide equal 
access to cooperative businesses and businesses seeking to convert to cooperative organization can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources. 
The State Treasurer already has two programs that allow banks to pay the State rates on deposits that are 2% below 
market with the agreement that the banks will pass the lower interest rates on to celiain borrowers. One is for 
commercial enterprises and one is for agricultural entities. Each is capped at $4,000,000 for a total of $8,000,000 in 
state deposits at reduced rates. This bill expands eligibility for the agriculturallinlced investment program to include 
agricultural enterprises organized as cooperatives. Expanding eligibility but keeping the same $4,000,000 cap will not 
lose any additional revenue to the State.
