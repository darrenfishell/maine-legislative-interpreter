to 37 in L.D.) and inserting the following:

may call and hold a special election to fill the vacancy in the same manner as elections

person eligible to fill the vacancy. When any trustee eeases to be a resident af the 
distriet, the trustee shall ',aeate the offiee of trustee and the ',aeaney must be filled 
flUFSuant to this seetion. The trustees may establish in bylaws particular circumstances 
under which a vacancy is deemed to be created, ~ including, but not limited to, a trustee's

holding the office of town councilor or road commissioner in the Town of Hampden is 
not eligible for nomination or election as trustee. The trustees may procure an office and

board of trustees is determined by the board of trustees. At the close of each fiscal year, 
the trustees shall make a detailed report of their doings, of the receipts and expenditures

determine by agreement or, failing to agree, they shall determine by lot new terms of 
office of each trustee as follows: 
1. One trustee's term ends on the 3rd Thursday of January 2017; 
2. Two trustees' terms end on the 3rd Thursday of January 2018; and 
3. Two trustees' terms end on the 3rd Thursday of January 2019.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment provides that current tem1S of the trustees of the Hampden Water 
District are modified to transition from the current 5-year terms to the 3-year terms 
established in the bill. The amendment also removes language from the bill and from the 
district's current charter that defines particular circumstances that create a vacancy in the 
position of trustee; the amendment authorizes the board of trustees to define in its bylaws 
particular circumstances under which a vacancy is deemed to be created, such as when a 
trustee ceases to be a resident of the district.
