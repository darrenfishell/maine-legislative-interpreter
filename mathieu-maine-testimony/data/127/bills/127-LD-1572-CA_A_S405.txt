SUMMARY 
This amendment does the following. 
1. It restricts the application of the bill to a rental unit for which the landlord receives 
federal rent subsidies under the multifamily housing rental assistance program, the 
housing choice voucher program, the new construction program, the substantial 
rehabilitation program or the moderate rehabilitation program. The ability of tenants in 
public housing owned and operated by the State to possess a firearm is addressed by a 
1995 Supreme Judicial Court decision. 
23 2. It limits the bill's prohibition on firearm restrictions to the tenant's specific rental 
24 unit and allows a landlord to impose reasonable restrictions related to the possession, use 
25 or transport of a firearm within common areas as long as those restrictions do not 
26 circumvent the use or possession of a firearm in the tenant's rental unit. 
27 3. It modifies the landlord immunity provision to cover civil liability that may arise 
28 from any firearm, legally or illegally possessed, that the landlord is required to allow on 
29 the property under the bill. The bill limits the landlord's immunity to cases in which the 
30 firearm was lawfully owned by the tenant. 
31 4. It provides that the landlord immunity provision does not cover willfully, 
32 recklessly or grossly negligent acts by the landlord. The bill exempts the landlord from 
33 immunity only when that landlord is grossly negligent. 
34 5. It exempts an owner-occupied housing accommodation of 4 units or fewer from 
35 the bill's prohibition on firearm restrictions.
