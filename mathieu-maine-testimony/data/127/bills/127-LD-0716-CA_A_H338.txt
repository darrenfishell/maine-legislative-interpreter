127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,,~ " to H.P. 492, L.D. 716, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Fees for Snowmobile Registration" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Amend the Fees for Snowmobile Registrations and To Create the 
Snowmobile Trail Fund Donation Sticker' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, Maine's snowmobile industry is a vital part of the economy and depends 
on the quantity and quality of the State's snowmobile trails; and 
Whereas, the State's snowmobile trails are created and maintained by a volunteer 
network of snowmobile clubs supported in part by snowmobile registration fees; and 
Whereas, these snowmobile clubs are struggling to maintain the snowmobile trail 
system at current funding levels, and, unless additional funding is provided for 
snowmobile trail creation and maintenance, the State's snowmobile trails will begin to 
deteriorate, causing economic hardship throughout the State; and 
Whereas, as snowmobile trail creation and maintenance must be planned for and 
started well before the beginning of the snowmobile season, this Act must take effect 
prior to 90 days after the adjournment of the Legislature; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:

The bill increases the annual snowmobile registration fee on residents by $5, nonresident 3-consecutive-day 
registrations by $6 and nonresident seasonal registrations by $11. The bill directs revenue from these fee increases to 
the Snowmobile Trail Fund (STF) within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The bill 
establishes a nonresident lO-consecutive-day snowmobile registration at $75 each. This bill also establishes donation 
stickers of $25, $50 and $100 with proceeds going to the STF after deducting $2 for the Department ofInland 
Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW). Any additional revenue to the General Fund, STF and IFW from the donation stickers 
and nonresident 10-consecutive-day snowmobile registration is expected to be minor. The estimated Other Special 
Revenue Funds revenue increase from raising snowmobile registrations fees is $493,719 in fiscal year 2015-16 and in 
every subsequent fiscal year. Additional costs to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry from 
submitting written policies specifying criteria used to distribute this revenue are expected to be minor.
