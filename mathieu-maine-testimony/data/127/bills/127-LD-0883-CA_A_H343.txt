COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 602, L.D. 883, Bill, "An Act To Create 
the Cellular Telephone Labeling Act" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA c. 261-B is enacted to read: 
CHAPTER 261-B 
CELLULAR TELEPHONE LABELING ACT 
§lS37. Shorttitle 
This chapter may be known and cited as "the Cellular Telephone Labeling Act."

2. Prominence of safety notifications on product packaging. If a cellular

1 Inside Regarding Safe Use of This Product" and language directing consumers to the 
2 page or pages of the owner's manual where the safety notifications may be found. 
3 3. Disclosure label required. If a cellular telephone manufacturer does not include 
4 safety notifications within its owner's manual, that cellular telephone manufacturer shall 
5 ensure that on the outside of the product packaging the word "DISCLOSURE" appears in 
6 capital letters in bold type at least 118 inch in height, followed by the statement, "This

11 5. Violation. A violation of this chapter is a violation of the Maine Unfair Trade 
12 Practices Act.' 
13 SU~y 
14 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. This amendment requires 
15 disclosure labels for cellular telephones instead of warning labels. The amendment 
16 removes requirements for retailers from the bill regarding warning labels and information 
17 bulletins for cellular telephones and no longer prohibits a retailer from selling cellular 
18 telephones in the State that do not comply with the requirements of the bill. The 
19 amendment changes the information required on product packaging and creates a new 
20 disclosure requirement for those cellular telephone manufacturers that do not include 
21 safety notifications within their owner's manual.
