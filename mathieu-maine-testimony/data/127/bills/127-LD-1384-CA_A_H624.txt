8 SUMMARY 
9 This amendment, which is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
10 Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development, replaces the bill and makes 
11 changes to the substance abuse testing laws, including the following. 
12 1. It requires an employer to adopt a uniform policy for substance abuse testing as 
13 developed by the Department of Labor. 
14 2. It provides that all confirmed positive substance abuse tests may be reported to the 
15 employer only by a medical review officer, who may not be employed by the employer. 
16 3. It allows an employee to provide a legitimate medical explanation for a positive 
17 test result for legally obtained medications, including medical marijuana, preventing the 
18 medical review officer from reporting a positive test for that substance to the employer. 
19 4. It changes the definitions of "employer" and "employee" so that a temporary 
20 employee provided by an employment agency that is directly supervised by an employer 
21 must be treated the same as a regular employee of that employer for purposes of 
22 substance abuse testing laws. 
23 5. It allows testing laboratories to use alternate federal substance abuse testing 
24 standards. 
25 6. Under current law, an employer must provide an employee who receives an initial 
26 confirmed positive result from a substance abuse test with an opportunity to participate in 
27 a rehabilitation program before discharging or disciplining the employee. This 
28 amendment reduces the timeframe for completing such a rehabilitation program from 6 
29 months to 12 weeks.
