SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
amendment establishes a competitive bid process, administered by the Department of 
Public Safety, Gambling Control Board, to authorize one entity to be licensed to conduct 
advance deposit wagering in the State on horse racing. The board is charged with 
adopting rules to govern the conduct of advance deposit wagering in addition to 
administering the licensing process and enforcement of the laws and rules governing the 
gambling activity. 
Advance deposit wagering is a method of wagering on horse racing in which bets are 
made electronically, by telephone or in person. A bettor establishes an account with the 
licensee from which the licensee makes withdrawals to place bets on behalf of the 
account holder and into which the licensee deposits income from winning bets. 
Under the amendment, a person is eligible to submit a bid to become the single 
advance deposit wagering licensee in the State if the person is a commercial track or off­
track betting facility licensed in the State or if the person is an entity already licensed to 
conduct advance deposit wagering in another state. The person is required to execute a 
contract with the board. The contract will govern the amount of the net commission of 
advance deposit wagers that will be distributed by the board to recipients such as 
commercial tracks, the Sire Stakes Fund, the Agricultural Fair Support Fund, off-track 
betting facilities, harness racing purses and the General Fund. The amendment provides 
the percentages of the net commission that must be distributed by the board to these 
recipients.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill requires the Gambling Control Board (GCB) within the Department of Public Safety to develop a Request-for­
Proposal to award one bidder the privilege to be licensed to conduct advance deposit wagering for horse races. Bidders 
will pay a $1,000 bidding fee to win the right to administer advance deposit wagering, resulting in $1,000 of General 
Fund revenue for each bid proposal. A license to conduct advance deposit wagering is $500 of General Fund revenue. 
The GCB will require a General Fund appropriation of $95,000 and $95,316 in fiscal year 2017-18 and 2018-19, 
respectively, for one Auditor II position and related costs. 
The advance deposit wager licensee shall collect the net commission from wagers and distribute 10% to the General 
Fund for both intrastate races and interstate races and 35% and 18% to certain Other Special Revenue Funds accounts 
on intrastate races and interstate races, respectively. The amount of revenue from net commissions on wagers will 
depend on the contract between the winning bidder and the GCB, especially the degree to which the winning bidder 
will cover the General Fund costs of $95,000 annually for administration and oversight of advance deposit wagering. 
No estimate of the increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue is made at this time. This fiscal note assumes that 
there will be an adequate amount of General Fund revenue from the net commission on wagers to cover the costs of the 
General Fund appropriations to the GCB.
