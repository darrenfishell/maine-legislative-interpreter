benefits may be recovered from an individual's contributions, any benefits or life 11 
insurance benefits payable under this Part t o the individual or the beneficiary of the 12 
individual or any combination of contributions and benefits.  If the overpayment or 13

provided by an employee of the retirement syst em, or a mistake of the retiree or the 15 
recipient of the benefit or life insurance benefit, a penalty or interest may not be assessed 16 
by the retirement system.  In all cases of recovery of overpayments through the reduction 17 
of a retirement benefit, whether with or without the assessment of interest by the 18 
retirement system, the recovery practices must be reasonable and consider the personal 19 
economic stability of the retiree in the establishment of the recovery schedule.  The 20 
executive director may also take action to recover those amounts due from any amounts 21 
payable to the individual by any other state agency or by an action in a court of 22

amounts under this subsection, t hat decision is subject to appeal under section 17451.  24

retirement plan by the employer through no fault of the employee, the employee may not 28 
lose any retirement benefits.  The State is not responsible for the employer contribution 29

SUMMARY  13 
This bill does the following:  14 
1.  It clarifies that cost -of-living adjustments for benefit recipients from the 15 
Governor's Ret irement Fund are the same as those paid to benefit recipients from the 16 
State Employee and Teacher Retirement Program;  17 
2.  It clarifies the authority and responsibilities of the Board of Trustees of the Maine 18 
Public Employees Retirement System with respect to eligibility and membership issues 19 
that arise in the context of the Participating Local District Retirement Program.  In 20 
Kennebec County v. Maine Public Employees Retirement System , 2014 ME 26 21 
(February 20, 2014), the Law Court held that the retirement s ystem did not have the 22 
statutory authority to make final administrative decisions with respect to enrollment 23 
election matters, when the local employer's employees were not members of the Maine 24 
Public Employees Retirement System.  This bill provides explici t statutory authority for 25 
the retirement system and the board to continue to make such determinations, as they had 26 
prior to the court's decision.  Consistent adherence to federal law is required to ensure that 27 
the retirement plan of the Maine Public Employ ees Retirement System remains a 28 
qualified governmental retirement plan entitled to favorable tax treatment under the 29 
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;  30 
3.  It codifies language enacted in Public Law 2007, chapter 240, Part U, section 8 to 31 
make clear that administrative costs and expenses attributable to the administrative 32 
operating budget of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System are charged against 33 
the assets of applicable funds;  34 
4.  It repeals obsolete language pertaining to in formation included in the retirement 35 
system's annual report to the Legislature;  36 
5.  It removes the requirement that the Legislature approve collective bargaining 37 
agreements between the retirement system and its employees;  38 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1151(01) -1 
 6.  It amends and repeals existing  laws to reflect that the retirement system no longer 1 
administers a distinct expense fund, since all administrative expenses are paid out of 2 
applicable fund assets; and  3 
7.  It makes the manner in which the member contribution rate is established for 4 
specif ic members of the Participating Local District Retirement Program consistent with 5 
how member contribution rates are established for all other members of the program.  6
