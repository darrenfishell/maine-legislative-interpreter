SUMMARY  19 
This bill implements the recommendations of the task force to ensure integrity in the 20 
use of service animals establi shed pursuant to Resolve 2015, chapter 36.  21 
The committee has not taken a position on the substance of the recommendations or 22 
this bill and by reporting this bill out the committee is not suggesting and does not intend 23 
to suggest that it agrees or disagrees  with any aspect of the task force's recommendations 24 
or this bill.  The committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of turning the task 25 
force's proposal into a printed bill that can be referred to the committee for an appropriate 26 
public hearin g and subsequent processing in the normal course.  The committee is taking 27 
this action to ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the task force's 28 
proposal.  29 
The bill creates a definition for "assistance animal," which distinguishes ass istance 30 
animals from service animals, and amends the definition of "service animal" to achieve 31 
this distinction.  It amends the provisions in the Maine Human Rights Act related to fair 32 
housing and public accommodations to provide clarity regarding their ap plication to 33 
service animals compared to assistance animals.  It also amends provisions in the Maine 34 
Revised Statutes, Title 7 to align with the new definitions.  Finally, it increases the 35 
penalty for misrepresentation as a service dog or assistance animal . 36
