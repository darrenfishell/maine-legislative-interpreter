function dental assistants, dental hygienists, public health dental hygienists, dental 
hygiene therapists, independent practice dental hygienists, dental radiographers and

that any license or permit in effect on the effective date of the Act remains in effect 
through its current date of expiration, at which time a new license or authority may be
