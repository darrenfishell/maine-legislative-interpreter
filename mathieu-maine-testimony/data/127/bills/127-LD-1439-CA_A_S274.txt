circumstances: 
A. The individual is seeking to be employed or is currently employed by an 
employer subject to the requirements of this chapter; 
B. The employer has chosen to sponsor the individual's request for the removal of 
the ban in order to create or maintain an employment relationship; and 
C. The employer must attest to the department that the decision to sponsor the 
waiver request occurred after the employer considered the objectively reasonable 
factors under subsection 15 and the following factors: 
(1) The nature and gravity of the disqualifying offense or offenses; 
(2) The time that has passed since the disqualifying offense or offenses; 
(3) The nature of the employment held or sought; 
(4) Whether the criminal conduct was employment-related; and 
(5) A reasonable conclusion that the individual does not pose a threat of harm to 
a protected individual or others in the care and support of the individual. 
The waiver must be sought with respect to the prospective or continued employment by a 
specific employer that is willing to sponsor the individual's request. An employee 
seeking a waiver may be conditionally employed in accordance with section 9057, 
subsection 4 and section 9058, subsection 3 until the waiver is denied. 
14. Approval of waiver. The department shall specify in rule the criteria for issuing 
a waiver for a disqualifying offense. The waiver determination is based on a 
consideration of the facts and circumstances of the specific individual's conviction that 
include the passage of time, extenuating circumstances, a demonstration of rehabilitation 
and the relevancy of the particular disqualifying offense with respect to the current or 
prospective employment with a sponsoring employer. All waivers are contingent on a 
final determination by the department that the employer has reasonably determined that 
the health and safety of a protected individual is not in jeopardy and a denial of a waiver 
request is not otherwise warranted in accordance with federal or state law. 
15. Waivers; factors. The department shall specify in rule the minimum factors that 
an employer must consider when sponsoring a waiver under subsection 13. Any factors 
that an employer chooses to consider must be obiectively reasonable in supporting the 
attestation that the individual to whom the waiver would apply is unlikely to cause harm 
to a protected individual or others in the employer's care. Obiectively reasonable factors 
include: 
A. The age of the individual applying for a waiver at the time of the disqualifying 
offense; 
B. The amount of time that has passed since the disqualifying offense occurred; 
C. The total number and type of disqualifying offenses; 
D. Any proven mitigating circumstances surrounding the disqualifying offense;
