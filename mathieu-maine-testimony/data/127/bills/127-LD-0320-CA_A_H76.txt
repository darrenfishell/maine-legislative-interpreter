SUMMARY 
Current law provides for a license to use leashed dogs to track wounded animals and 
allows a person who holds such a license to provide dog tracking services to others for a 
fee without being licensed as a guide. This amendment consolidates those provisions and 
makes the following changes. 
1. It converts the license to use leashed dogs to track wounded animals from an 
annual license for $27 to a 3-year permit for $81.

2. It provides that a person must hold a big game hunting license to be eligible to 
obtain the permit to use a leashed dog to track a wounded animal and specifies that the 
permit only allows the tracking of a lawfully wounded animal. 
4 3. It allows the permit holder to track a wounded animal outside of legal hunting 
5 hours. 
6 4. It expressly gives the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife rule-making 
7 authority to regulate activities conducted pursuant to the permit. 
8 Current law allows a licensed hunting guide to track and dispatch a client's wounded 
9 bear, deer or moose after legal hunting hours without a license to use leashed dogs to 
10 track wounded bear, deer or moose. This amendment relocates and changes that 
11 provision of law to provide that the hunting guide must obtain authorization from the 
12 Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to track and dispatch a client's wounded 
13 bear, deer or moose after legal hunting hours. It also specifies that a guide authorized to 
14 track a wounded bear, deer or moose may use one leashed dog for tracking purposes.
