 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 2 
Whereas, state funding for the University of Maine System has remained relatively 3 
flat for a number of years; and 4 
Whereas, this flat funding has led to the proposal to eliminate certain university 5 
programs and faculty; and 6 
Whereas, this legislation needs to take effect immediately to provide sufficient 7 
funding to avoid irreparable harm to the University of Maine System; and 8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 10 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 11 
therefore, 12 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 13 
Sec. 1.  Appropriations and allocations.  The following appropriations and 14
