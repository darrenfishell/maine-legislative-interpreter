 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  14 MRSA §6321, first and 2nd ¶¶, as amended by PL 2007, c. 391, §9, 2 
are further amended to read:  3 
After breach of condition in a mortgage of first priority, the mortgagee or any person 4 
claiming under the mortgagee , as long as that person is the owner of the mortgage loan 5 
secured by the mortgage and also is the party entitled to enforce the debt secured by the 6 
mortgage,  may proceed for the purpose of foreclosure by a civil action against a ll parties 7 
in interest in either the Superior Court or the District Court in the division in which the 8 
mortgaged premises or any part of the mortgaged premises is located, regardless of the 9 
amount of the mortgage claim.   10 
After breach of condition of any m ortgage other than one of the first priority, the 11 
mortgagee or any person claiming under the mortgagee , as long as that person is the 12 
owner of the mortgage loan secured by the mortgage and also is the party entitled to 13 
enforce the debt secured by the mortg age, may proceed for the purpose of foreclosure by 14 
a civil action against all parties in interest, except for parties in interest having a superior 15 
priority to the foreclosing mortgagee, in either the Superior Court or the District Court in 16 
the division in  which the mortgaged premises or any part of the mortgaged premises is 17 
located. Parties in interest having a superior priority may not be joined nor will their 18 
interests be affected by the proceedings, but the resulting sale under section 6323 is of the 19 
defendant or mortgagor's equity of redemption only. The plaintiff shall notify the priority 20 
parties in interest of the action by sending a copy of the complaint to the parties in 21 
interest by certified mail.  22 
Sec. 2.  14 MRSA §6321, as amended by PL 2013, c. 5 55, §2, is further amended 23 
by adding after the 2nd paragraph a new paragraph to read:  24 
As used in this section, "owner" means the ultimate economic beneficiary of the loan 25 
secured by the mortgage, except that, if the loan is held in trust for the benefit of  investors 26 
or as a means to provide investment interests in a pool of loans, the trustee is considered 27 
to be the owner.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill requires a mortgage loan owner to conduct a foreclosure in the name of the 30 
mortgage loan owner, instead of a mortgage loan servicer, to ensure that courts and 31 
parties know that the foreclosing plaintiff is the mortgage loan owner and the entity 32 
whose loan modification programs affect the ability of homeowners to obtain loan 33 
modifications.  34
