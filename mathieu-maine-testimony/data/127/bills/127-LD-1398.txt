 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, current law concerning the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust 3 
Fund provides for the trust funds to be allocated at a certain percentage up through this 4 
fiscal year; and  5 
Whereas, in order to continue allocation for the next series of fiscal years and to 6 
modify the percentage to a more business -friendly rate, it is necessary to amend this 7 
section of law before the next fiscal year, which begins in July; and  8 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 9 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 10 
immediately necessary  for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 11 
therefore,  12 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  13 
Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §10109, sub -§4, ¶A, as amended by PL 2013, c. 369, Pt. A, 14 
§15, is further amended to read:  15

19, not less than 50% 10% of the trust funds received during those years must be 17 
allocated for measures, investments and, loans,  arrangements and technical assistance  18 
that reduce ele ctricity consumption or reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower 19 
energy costs at commercial or industrial facilities, and 35% of the funds received by 20 
the trust fund during those years must be used for investment in measures that lower 21 
residential heating  energy demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The 22 
measures that lower residential heating demand must be fuel -neutral and may 23 
include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency improvements to residential 24 
buildings and upgrades to efficient heating systems that will reduce residential energy 25 
costs and greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the board. The trust shall 26 
transfer to the commission 15% 55% of funds received by the trust fund during fiscal 27 
years 2013 -14, 2014 -15 and  year 2015 -16, which the commission shall direct 28 
transmission and distribution utilities to disburse to business  ratepayers in a manner 29 
that provides maximum benefit to the Maine economy. Subject to the apportionment 30 
pursuant to this subsection, the trust shall fund conservati on programs that give 31 
priority to measures with the highest benefit -to-cost ratio, as long as cost -effective 32 
collateral efficiency opportunities are not lost, and that:  33 
(1)  Reliably reduce greenhouse gas production and heating energy costs by fossil 34 
fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per 35 
unit of emissions; or  36 
(2)  Reliably reduce the consumption of electricity in the State at the lowest cost 37 
in funds from the trust fund per kilowatt -hour saved.  38

assistance to the required uses of the allocated funds, which also include measures, 5 
investments and arrangements that reduce electricity consumption o r reduce greenhouse 6 
gas emissions and lower energy costs at commercial or industrial facilities.  It changes the 7
