 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  29-A MRSA §2056, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2009, c. 91, §1, is further 2 
amended to read:  3 
2.  Pedestrian on way.   Where sidewalks are not provided, a pedestrian shall walk 4 
facing approachi ng traffic on the left side of the public way or the way's shoulder when 5 
practicable.  An operator of a motor vehicle who is passing a pedestrian on a public way 6 
or the way’s shoulder shall exercise due care by leaving a distance between the motor 7 
vehicle and the pedestrian of not less than 3 feet while the motor vehicle is passing the 8 
pedestrian. A motor vehicle operator may pass a pedestrian in a no -passing zone only 9 
when it is safe to do so.  10 
The collision of a motor vehicle with a pedestrian is prima fac ie evidence of a violation of 11 
this subsection.  12 
SUMMARY  13 
Current law requires the operator of a motor vehicle to leave a distance of at least 3 14 
feet when passing a bicyclist, a person on roller skis or a pedestrian.  If a collision occurs 15 
between a motor veh icle and a bicyclist or roller skier, it is prima facie evidence of a 16 
violation of the 3 -foot requirement by the operator of the motor vehicle; no such 17 
provision is included for a collision between a motor vehicle and a pedestrian.  18 
This bill provides that a collision between a motor vehicle and a pedestrian is prima 19 
facie evidence of a violation of the 3 -foot requirement by the operator of the motor 20 
vehicle.  21
