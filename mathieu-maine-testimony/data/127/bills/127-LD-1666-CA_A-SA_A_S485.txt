127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
SENATE AMENDMENT ",4" to COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 
1136, L.D. 1666, "Resolve, Regarding Legislative Review of Portions of Chapter 3: 
Maine Clean Election Act and Related Provisions, a Late-filed Major Substantive Rule of 
the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices" 
Amend the amendment in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 2 (page 1, lines 
26 to 29 in amendment) and inserting the following: 
'2. The rule must be amended in Section 2, subsection 4, paragraph N to specify that 
a candidate may receive volunteer assistance with the collection of qualifying 
contributions if the person organizing the volunteers is a paid member of the candidate's 
campaign, a volunteer or entitled to the political party staff exemption.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the requirement added by Committee Amendment "A" that 
the rules be changed to state that payments to persons authorized to collect qualifying 
contributions may be made using only seed money contributions received by the 
candidate. This amendment also requires that the rules be changed to allow volunteers 
collecting qualifying contributions to be organized by a paid member of the candidate's 
staff, in addition to a volunteer or political party staff.
