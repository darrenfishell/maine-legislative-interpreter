 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  14 MRSA ยง6203 -A, as repealed and replaced by PL 2009, c. 476, Pt. B, ยง3 2 
and affected by ยง9, is amended to read:  3 
ยง6203 -A.  Power of sale; procedure; notice; form  4 
1.  Power of sale.  Any holder of a mortgage on real estate that is granted by a 5 
corporation, partnership, including a limited partnership or a limited liability partnership , 6 
limited liability company or trustee of a trust and that contains a power of sale, as 7 
described in Title 33, section 501 -A, or a person authorized by the power of sale, or an 8 
attorney duly authorized by a writing under seal, or a person acting in the name of the 9 
holder of such mortgage or any such authorized person, may, upon breach of condition 10 
and without a ction, do all the acts authorized or required by the power; except that a sale 11 
under the power is not effectual to foreclose a mortgage unless, previous to the sale, 12 
notice has been published once in each of 3 successive weeks, the first publication to be 13 
not less than 21 days before the day of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in 14 
the town where the land lies and which notice must prominently state the street address of 15 
the real estate encumbered by the mortgage deed, if any, and the book and p age number 16 
of the mortgage, if any  comply with the requirements of subsection 3 .  This provision is 17 
implied in every power of sale mortgage in which it is not expressly set forth.  For 18 
mortgage deeds executed on or after October 1, 1993, the power of sale may be used only 19 
if the mortgage deed states that it is given primarily for a business, commercial or 20 
agricultural purpose.  A copy of the notice must, at least 21 days before the date of the 21 
sale under the power in the mortgage, be recorded in each regist ry of deeds in which the 22 
mortgage deed is or by law ought to be recorded and must be served on the mortgagor or 23 
its representative in interest, or may be sent by registered mail addressed to the mortgagor 24 
or the mortgagor's representative at the mortgagor' s last known address, or to the person 25 
and to the address as may be agreed upon in the mortgage, at least 21 days before the date 26 
of the sale under the power in the mortgage.   Any power of sale incorporated into a 27 
mortgage is not affected by the subsequent  transfer of the mortgaged premises from the 28 
corporation, partnership, including a limited partnership or a limited liability partnership , 29 
limited liability company or trustee of the trust to any other type of organization or to an 30 
individual or individual s.  The power of sale may not be used to foreclose a mortgage 31 
deed granted by a trustee of a trust if at the time the mortgage deed is given the real estate 32 
is used exclusively for residential purposes, the real estate has 4 or fewer residential units 33 
and one of the units is the principal residence of the owner of at least 1/2 of the beneficial 34 
interest in the trust.  If the mortgage deed contains a statement that at the time the 35 
mortgage deed is given the real estate encumbered by the mortgage deed is not used 36 
exclusively for residential purposes, that the real estate has more than 4 residential units 37 
or that none of the residential units is the principal residence of the owner of at least 1/2 38 
of the beneficial interest in the trust, the statement conclusiv ely establishes these facts and 39 
the mortgage deed may be foreclosed by the power of sale.  The method of foreclosure of 40 
real estate mortgages provided by this section is specifically subject to the order of 41 
priorities  rights of junior mortgagees  set out in  section 6205.  42 
1-A.  Notice to mortgagor and parties in interest; definition.  At least 21 days 43 
before the date of the sale under the power in a mortgage, a copy of the foreclosure notice 44 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0676(01) -1 
 must be served on the mortgagor or its representative in interest, o r may be sent by 1 
registered or certified mail addressed to the mortgagor or the mortgagor's representative 2 
at the mortgagor's last known address, or to the person and to the address as may be 3 
agreed upon in the mortgage or to the address as may be provided  in writing by the 4 
mortgagor to the mortgagee.  In addition, a copy of the foreclosure notice must be sent by 5 
first-class mail, postmarked at least 21 days prior to the public sale, to all other parties in 6 
interest, except for parties in interest having a superior priority to the foreclosing 7 
mortgagee, at the address, if any, listed in the instrument evidencing the interest, and, if 8 
none is listed, to the registered agent for the party in interest, or to any other address that 9 
may be readily available to th e mortgagee.  For the purposes of this section, "parties in 10 
interest" means those parties having a claim to the real estate whose claim is recorded in 11 
the registry of deeds as of the time of recording the notice of foreclosure.  Failure to 12 
notify any party  in interest, other than the mortgagor, does not invalidate the foreclosure 13 
as to other parties in interest who were given notice.  14 
2.  Notice to tenants; effect on title.  In addition to the notices provided pursuant to 15 
subsection 1 1-A, the mortgagee shal l provide a copy of the foreclosure  notice to a 16 
residential tenant if the mortgagee knows or should know by exercise of due diligence 17 
that the property is occupied as a rental unit.  Upon request from a mortgagee, the 18 
mortgagor or its representative in int erest shall provide the name, address and other 19 
contact information for any residential tenant.  Notice to a residential tenant may be 20 
served on the residential tenant by sheriff or, may be sent by first class mail and 21 
registered mail  at the residential te nant's last known address or may be posted 22 
conspicuously at each entrance to the mortgaged premises .  A residential tenant may not 23 
be evicted unless a mortgagee institutes an action for forcible entry and detainer pursuant 24 
to section 6001 at least 21 days after a mortgagee has served the notice required by this 25 
subsection.  This subsection may not be construed to prohibit an action for forcible entry 26 
and detainer in accordance with section 6001 for a reason that is not related to a 27 
foreclosure sale.  The fa ilure to provide the notice required by this subsection does not 28 
affect the validity of the foreclosure sale.  29 
2-A.  Recording foreclosure notice.  At least 21 days before the date of a sale under 30 
the power in a mortgage, a copy of the foreclosure notice mu st be recorded in each 31 
registry of deeds in which the mortgage deed is or by law ought to be recorded in order to 32 
provide constructive notice.  33 
3.  Form of foreclosure notice.  A foreclosure notice must identify the mortgagee, 34 
the mortgagor, the terms of th e public sale, the location, date and time of the public sale, 35 
the street address, if any, of the real estate encumbered by the mortgage, a description of 36 
the real estate encumbered by the mortgage, which may be incorporated by reference to 37 
the book and pa ge number of an instrument of record containing an adequate legal 38 
description of the real estate, and the book and page number, if any, of the mortgage.   The 39 
following form of foreclosure notice may be used and may be altered as circumstances 40 
require; but nothing herein may be construed to prevent the use of other forms.  41

4.  Notice of sale.  A foreclosure  notice of sale in subsection 3,  published in 23 
accordance with this chapter or in accordance with the power in the mortgage together 24 
with such other or fu rther notice, if any, as is required by the mortgage, along with notice 25 
to the mortgagor and parties in interest whose interest appears of record at the time that 26 
the foreclosure notice is recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds,  is sufficient notice  27 
of the sale, and the premises are considered to have been sold , and the  free and clear of 28 
the interest of the mortgagor and of all other parties in interest who have been given 29 
notice in compliance with subsection 1 -A, except for parties in interest havin g a superior 30 
priority to the foreclosing mortgagee.  The  deed thereunder must convey the premises 31 
subject to and with the benefit of all restrictions, easements, improvements, outstanding 32 
tax titles, municipal or other public taxes, assessments, liens or c laims in the nature of 33 
liens and existing encumbrances of record created prior to the mortgage, whether or not 34 
reference to such restrictions, easements, improvements, liens or encumbrances is made 35 
in the deed ; but no purchaser at the sale is bound to comp lete the purchase if there are 36 
encumbrances, other than those named in the mortgage and included in the notice of the 37 
sale, that are not stated at the sale and included in the seller's contract with the purchase  38 
or foreclosure notice .  Any other party in i nterest having a claim to the real estate whose 39 
claim is not recorded in the registry of deeds as of the time of recording the foreclosure 40 
notice need not be given notice, and any such party has no claim against the real estate 41 
after completion of the publ ic sale, in accordance with Title 33, section 501 -A.  The 42 
interests of parties in interest having a superior priority are not affected by the 43 
foreclosure.  44 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR0676(01) -1 
 5.  Public sale.  At the completion of  a public sale pursuant to this section, the 1 
foreclosing mortga gee shall execute  a purchase and sale agreement with the highest 2 
bidder.  The purchase and sale agreement may be assigned by the purchaser.  If the 3 
highest bidder fails to perform on the agreement, the foreclosing mortgagee may execute 4 
a purchase and sale agreement with the next highest bidder.  If the foreclosing mortgagee 5 
is the highest bidder or becomes the highest bidder by failure of a bidder to perform a 6 
purchase and sale agreement, a purchase and sale agreement need not be executed.  A  7 
mortgagee may bid and may purchase any real estate sold at such sale, as long as the 8 
mortgagee is the highest bidder.  If the real estate is sold for an amount in excess of the 9 
outstanding balance of the mortgage together with all interest and costs, said excess must 10 
be used to satisfy any other encumbrances on said property  the claims of parties in 11 
interest whose interests were extinguished by the foreclosure in the order of priority that 12 
existed prior to the foreclosure  and, after all said encumbrances  of those parties  in interest  13 
are satisfied together with all interest and costs, any excess then remaining must be paid 14 
to the mortgagor.  If the mortgagor or any person holding an encumbrance  such party in 15 
interest  cannot be found after a diligent search, the money must be paid into the Superior 16 
Court in the county where the land lies for the benefit of the mortgagor or the holder of 17 
any such encumbrance.  18 
6.  Continuation of sale.  A public sale pursuant to this section may be adjourned, 19 
for any time not exceeding 30 days  and from time to time until a sale is made, by 20 
announcement to those present at each adjournment.  21 
Sec. 2.  14 MRSA ยง6203 -B, as amended by PL 2009, c. 476, Pt. B, ยง4 and affected 22

 Sec. 5.  14 MRSA ยง6203 -G is enacted to read:  1 
ยง6203 -G.  Assignment of mortgage  2 
The assignment of a mortgage by a foreclosing mortgagee at any time during the 3 
foreclosure process does not affect the validity of the foreclosure.  Upon  the recording of 4 
the assignment of mortgage in the registry of deeds where the land lies, the assignee of 5 
the mortgage may complete the foreclosure.  6 
Sec. 6.  32 MRSA ยง286, sub -ยง5, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 146, ยง5, is amended to 7 
read:  8 
5.  Mortgage foreclo sure sales.  This chapter does not apply to any individual 9 
conducting a mortgage  foreclosure sale pursuant to a court order . 10 
Sec. 7.  33 MRSA ยง501 -A, as amended by PL 1995, c. 106, ยง2, is further amended 11 
to read:  12 
ยง501 -A.  "Power of sale"  13 
The following "pow er" is known as "The Statutory Power of Sale" and may be 14 
included in any mortgage or incorporated by reference in any mortgage granted by a 15 
corporation, partnership, including a limited partnership or a limited liability partnership , 16 
limited liability comp any or trustee of a trust and, if included in the mortgage, the 17 
mortgage may be foreclosed pursuant to Title 14, section 6203 -A.  The power of sale may 18 
not be used to foreclose a mortgage deed granted by a trustee of a trust if at the time the 19 
mortgage dee d is given the real estate is used exclusively for residential purposes, the real 20 
estate has 4 or fewer residential units and one of the units is the principal residence of the 21 
owner of at least 1/2 of the beneficial interest in the trust.  If the mortgage  deed contains a 22 
statement that at the time the mortgage deed is given the real estate encumbered by the 23 
mortgage deed is not used exclusively for residential purposes, that the real estate has 24 
more than 4 residential units or that none of the residential units is the principal residence 25 
of the owner of at least 1/2 of the beneficial interest in the trust, the statement 26 
conclusively establishes these facts and the mortgage deed may be foreclosed by the 27 
power of sale.  28 
POWER  29 
But upon  Upon  any default in the p erformance or the observance of the foregoing or 30 
other condition, the mortgagee or his the mortgagee's  executors, administrators, 31

partial release thereof, either as a whole or in parcels, together with all improvements that 35 
may be thereon, by a public sale on or near the premises  in the county where the real 36 
estate  then subject to the mortgage is situated , or, if more than one parcel is then subject 37 
thereto, then on or near  in the county where  one of said parcels is situated , or at such 38 
place as may be designa ted for the purpose in the mortgage, first complying with the 39 
terms of the mortgage and the statutes relating to the foreclosure of mortgage by the 40

 exercise of a power of sale, and he or they  the mortgagee or the mortgagee's executors, 1 
administrators, succ essors or assigns or the agent or attorney of the mortgagee or the 2 
mortgagee's executors, administrators, successors or assigns  may convey the same by 3 
proper deed or deeds to the purchaser or purchasers absolutely and in fee simple; and 4 
such sale shall  forever bar bars the mortgagor and all persons claiming under it from all 5 
right and interest in the mortgaged premises, whether at law or in equity.  6 
SUMMARY  7 
This bill makes several changes to the power of sale mortgage foreclosure law in 8 
order to clarify cert ain provisions, improve notice to interested parties and ensure the 9 
marketability of titles.  The bill makes the following changes to the power of sale 10 
mortgage foreclosure law.  11 
1.  It clarifies that the statutory power of sale applies to a mortgage grante d by a 12 
limited liability partnership.  13 
2.  It provides cross -references between the power of sale laws in the Maine Revised 14 
Statutes, Title 14 and those in Title 33.  15 
3.  It requires that written notice of sale be sent to all parties in interest, not just th e 16 
mortgagor.  17 
4.  It provides that a written foreclosure notice may be given to the mortgagor at an 18 
address provided in writing by the mortgagor to the mortgagee.  19 
5.  It defines "parties in interest."  20 
6.  It clarifies that written foreclosure notices may be  delivered to the mortgagor by 21 
certified mail in addition to registered mail.  22 
7.  It provides that a copy of a notice of foreclosure may be provided to a residential 23 
tenant by posting the notice conspicuously at each entrance to the mortgaged premises.  24 
8.  It clarifies the information that must be included in a foreclosure notice of sale.  25 
9.  It provides that property may be sold free and clear of the interests of the 26 
mortgagor and other junior parties in interest who have been sent a foreclosure notice of 27 
sale, but specifies that parties in interest having a superior priority are not affected by the 28 
foreclosure.  29 
10.  It requires a foreclosing mortgagee to execute a purchase and sale agreement 30 
with the highest bidder at a public sale and provides that, if th e highest bidder fails to 31 
perform on the agreement, the foreclosing mortgagee may execute an agreement with the 32 
next highest bidder.  33 
11.  It provides that a foreclosure sale may be adjourned for up to 30 days and from 34 
time to time until a sale is made.  35 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR0676(01) -1 
 12.  It clarifies the information relating to a foreclosure that must be included in the 1 
recorded foreclosure affidavit.  2 
13.  It provides that a foreclosure affidavit must be recorded within 30 days after the 3 
date of delivery of the deed to the purchaser at t he foreclosure sale rather than 30 days 4 
after the date of the sale.  5 
14.  It requires a mortgagee to correct an error in a recorded foreclosure affidavit.  6
