This amendment reduces the General Fund appropriation 
by $8,591,829 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS) by funding only 50% of the rate increases for personal support and related 
services, by removing the 33% rate increase for certain home health services and by a one-time reduction of 
$4,000,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Federal Expenditures 
Fund allocations will also be reduced for these changes that impact the FMAP match. As amended, the bill has no net 
General Fund cost in the 2016-2017 biennium. 
This amendment also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a rate study of services in 
Section 40 Home Health Services and report back to the legislature by January 1, 2017. Any additional costs to the 
DHHS to perform a rate study and report back to the legislature are expected to be minor and can be absorbed within 
existing budgeted resources.
