Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA ยง1913 is enacted to read:  2 
ยง1913.  Backstop agreements for natural gas pipeline capacity  3 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 4 
following terms have the following meanings.  5 
A.  "Backstop agreement" means an agreement entered into between an interstate 6 
natural gas pipeline and a designated replacement shipper pursuant to which the 7 
designated replacement shipper agrees, upon a defaul t of an eligible customer, to 8 
enter into a service agreement with an interstate natural gas pipeline for an amount of 9 
the eligible customer's long -term interstate natural gas pipeline capacity under the 10 
same rates, terms and conditions as the eligible cust omer and for the remainder of the 11 
term of the eligible customer's contract term.   12 
B.  "Designated replacement shipper" means one or more gas utilities or transmission 13 
and distribution utilities required by the commission to enter into an agreement with 14 
an interstate natural gas pipeline for the long -term interstate natural gas pipeline 15 
capacity of an eligible customer.  16 
C.  "Eligible customer" means a commercial or industrial business or a subsidiary of 17 
that business that is located in this State and has an  agreement for a term of not less 18 
than 15 years to transport a maximum daily quantity of 7,500 dekatherms per day of 19 
natural gas.  20 
D.  "Eligible natural gas pipeline capacity" means new or incremental natural gas 21 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of natura l gas into this State or to delivery points 22 
within this State.  23 
2.  Order requiring execution of capacity backstop agreement.  Upon application 24 
of an eligible customer in accordance with subsection 5, the commission may require by 25 
written order that one or more gas utilities or transmission and distribution utilities enter 26 
into a backstop agreement, within 60 days of the commission's order, with applicable 27 
interstate natural gas pipelines for long -term interstate natural gas pipeline capacity that 28 
becomes av ailable in the event of a default of the eligible customer, if the commission 29 
finds that the designated replacement shipper is capable of meeting the requirements of 30 
this section.  The commission's order must identify the amount of long -term interstate 31 
natural gas pipeline capacity for a backstop agreement.  Upon a commission order 32 
requiring execution of a backstop agreement pursuant to this section, the commission 33 
shall reduce the cumulative total capacity of energy cost reduction contracts established 34 
under section 1904 by the capacity of the backstop agreement.  35 
Within 20 days of receipt of an application under subsection 5 for an order under this 36 
section, the commission shall consult with the Office of the Public Advocate and the 37 
utility or utilities reco mmended by the eligible customer as the designated replacement 38 
shipper. The commission's review of an application under this section is nonadjudicatory.  39 
The commission shall approve or reject the application within 60 days by issuance of a 40 
written order.  41

 3.  Limitation on resale of natural gas capacity.  A backstop agreement approved 1 
by the commission must provide that the eligible customer's resale of natural gas pipeline 2 
capacity may not exceed 15% profit excluding any natural gas capacity transportation  3 
charges.  If resale profits exceed 15%, the additional revenue must be used to reduce 4 
transmission and distribution rates in the location of the eligible customer's electric utility 5 
service area in a manner determined by the commission.  6 
4.  Commission cri teria.  The commission shall approve a request from an eligible 7 
customer and order one or more gas utilities or transmission and distribution utilities to 8 
enter into a backstop agreement with interstate natural gas pipelines pursuant to 9 
subsection 2 if the  commission finds:  10 
A.  The designation of the utility or utilities as a designated replacement shipper will 11 
enhance the viability of an eligible natural gas pipeline capacity project;  12 
B.  The eligible natural gas pipeline capacity project will increase nat ural gas 13 
transmission capacity into the State and will further the legislative findings in section 14 
1903;  15 
C.  The risks to utility ratepayers of an eligible customer's default are reasonable 16 
when compared to the benefits to be achieved for the eligible cust omer and the State 17 
as a result of the new or incremental natural gas pipeline capacity to be provided;  18 
D.  The gas utility or transmission and distribution utility, or its parent guarantor, has 19 
and continues to maintain a long -term senior, unsecured debt r ating, or in the absence 20 
of a long -term senior, unsecured debt rating, a local long -term issuer rating or an 21 
issuer rating, as applicable, of at least Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moody's 22 
Investors Service, Inc. and of at least BBB - with a stable outloo k from Standard and 23 
Poor's Corporation; and  24 
E.  The eligible customer is unable to meet or maintain the creditworthiness standards 25 
required to obtain eligible natural gas pipeline capacity.  26 
5.  Application.  An eligible customer may apply to the commission  to designate a 27 
utility as a designated replacement shipper and the application must provide a nonbinding 28 
recommendation of one or more utilities to be the shipper required to enter into a 29 
backstop agreement.  30 
6.  Actions presumed prudent; recovery of costs  incurred.  A gas utility's or 31 
transmission and distribution utility's actions undertaken in furtherance of a commission 32 
order under this section, including execution of a backstop agreement, are presumed to be 33 
prudent and require no further commission app roval. Notwithstanding anything to the 34 
contrary in subsection 1, paragraph A, with the approval of the commission, a gas utility 35 
or transmission and distribution utility required to enter into a backstop agreement for 36 
eligible interstate pipeline capacity as a designated replacement shipper under this section 37 
may recover in rates all costs reasonably incurred including administrative costs.  38
