SUMMARY 
This amendment allows the Department of Health and Human Services' investigation 
team to notify a child's parent, guardian or custodian that the child has been allegedly 
abused or neglected, rather than requiring the notification, to reflect that there are 
situations when the parent, guardian or custodian should not be notified. It also clarifies 
that the department, rather than the investigation team, may publish information on the 
department's publicly accessible website regarding an investigation, but only upon the 
conclusion ofthe investigation.
