The bill establishes the Farmland Restoration Program within the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
Forestry to provide assistance in improving lands for certain purposes. The program provides payments of up to 50% 
of the cost or $20,000, whichever is less, to approved restoration projects or 90% of the restoration costs, up to 
$20,000, for projects involving state-owned or municipal-owned farmland. This bill creates the Farmland Restoration 
Fund to make payments under the program. The fund may accept money from any public or private source as its 
funding. The bill includes a base Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $500 annually beginning in fiscal year 
2015-16 to allow for expenditure of any funding received. Because no funding is provided in the bill, it also includes 
General Fund appropriations of $95,840 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $126,423 in fiscal year 2016-17 for one Public 
Service Coordinator I position, one half-time Senior Planner position, one-time rulemaking costs and other related 
costs to set up and manage the program. 
Additional appropriations may be required to accomplish the purposes of this bill if adequate funding is not received 
from public and private sources. It should be noted that LD 386 is a proposed bond issue in the 127th Legislature and 
the proceeds could be used for the purposes of this program.
