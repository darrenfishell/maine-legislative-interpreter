authorized only if the following changes are made: 
1. The rule must be amended in section 4, subsection E to clarify, for the purposes of 
the urban impaired stream standard, that where there is a department-approved 
management and monitoring plan in place and monitoring demonstrates that a stressor in 
the watershed, which may be either a pollutant or a failure to meet a water quality 
standard, is contributing to the impairment of the urban impaired stream, the department 
may require the applicant to use alternative or additional stormwater treatment measures 
to address the identified stressor; and 
2. The rule must be amended in section 14 to extend the permit shield provision to 
the implementation of innovative measures to increase the probability that low-impact 
development measures will be installed.'
