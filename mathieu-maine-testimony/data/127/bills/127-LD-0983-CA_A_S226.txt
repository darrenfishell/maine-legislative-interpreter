12 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 345, L.D. 983 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies when wine is considered to be fine and rare for the purpose 
of being sold at auction. Under the bill, fine and rare wine is wine that is not available for 
sale in the State bya licensed retailer or wholesaler. The amendment clarifies that wine 
meets this fine and rare standard if it is not available for sale at the time the inventory of 
wine to be auctioned is provided to the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations. The amendment also 
states that notice of a wine auction must be made to the bureau at least 30 days in advance 
and that containers of auctioned wine are not subject to the bottle deposit law. 
This amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section to the bill.

The bill allows the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations (BABLO) within the Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services to issue wine auction pennits for $250 each, allowing pennit holders to hold 
wine auctions to sell wine. Auctioned wine must not be available for purchase through a wholesaler or retailer in the 
State at the time the inventory is submitted to BABLO. BABLO currently requires registering certain labels for $10 
each. This new wine auction pennit is estimated to reduce the number of people registering certain labels and results 
in a minor revnue loss to BABLO. The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $48,381 in fiscal year 2015-16 
and $65,960 in fiscal year 2016-17 to establish one new Office Associate II position to ensure that wine being 
auctioned is not available for purchase in the State.
