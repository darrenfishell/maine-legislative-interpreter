25 This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment changes 
26 the title and removes from the bill the provision that provides that an attorney may 
27 represent the victim at a sentencing hearing. It retains and clarifies the provision of the 
28 bill that allows an attorney to submit a written statement or speak on the victim's behalf.
