3.  Administration.   The department may administer and operate a program of aid to 12 
needy dependent children, called "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families" or 13 
"TANF," who are deprived of support or care due to the death, continu ed absence, 14 
physical or mental incapacity of a parent or the unemployment or underemployment of 15 
the principal wage earner  in accordance with the United States Social Security Act, as 16 
amended by PRWORA and DRA, and this Title.  17 
A.  The department shall adopt  rules as necessary to implement and administer the 18 
program.  The rules must include eligibility criteria, budgeting process, benefit 19 
calculation and confidentiality.  The confidentiality rules must ensure that 20 
confidentiality is maintained for TANF recipi ents at least to the same extent that 21 
confidentiality was maintained for families in the Aid to Families with Dependent 22 
Children program unless otherwise required by federal law or regulation.  23 
B.  The department may use funds, insofar as resources permit, provided under and in 24 
accordance with the United States Social Security Act or state funds appropriated for 25 
this purpose or a combination of state and federal funds to provide assistance to 26 
families under this chapter.  In addition to assistance for famili es described in this 27 
subsection, funds must be expended for the following purposes:  28 
(1)  To continue the pass -through of the first $50 per month of current child 29 
support collections and the exclusion of the $50 pass -through from the budget 30 
tests and benefi t calculations;  31 
(2)  To provide financial assistance to noncitizens legally admitted to the United 32 
States who are receiving assistance under this subsection as of July 1, 2011.  33 
Recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories  of 34 
noncitizens who would be eligible for the TANF programs but for their status as 35 
aliens under PRWORA.  Eligibility for the TANF program for these categories of 36 
noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of 37 
assistanc e from the TANF program. Any household receiving assistance as of  38 
July 1, 2011 may continue to receive assistance, as long as that household 39 
remains eligible, without regard to interruptions in coverage or gaps in eligibility 40

on July 1, 2011 that is later approved is not eligible for financial assistance 3 
through a state -funded program unless that noncitizen is:  4
