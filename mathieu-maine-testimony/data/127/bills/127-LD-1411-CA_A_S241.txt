21 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A .. to S.P. 526, L.D. 1411 
Amend the bill in Part B in section 4 in paragraph K in the 2nd line (page 12, line 15 
in L.D.) by inserting after the following: "paragraph" the following: 'K or' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment adds provisions to the bilI to delete certain date-limiting references 
in the definition of the term "financial aid package" under the income tax credit for 
educational opportunity laws to conform to ongoing practice in applying a credit-hours 
proration factor in the tax credit provisions. 
The amendment removes a section of the bill that strikes a reference to the former 
circuitbreaker program because of the continuing relevance of the former program in the 
administration of the municipal property tax abatement laws. 
The amendment removes from the bill proposed changes to the term "personal home 
care" under the service provider tax and instead strikes those words from the service 
provider tax laws as they do not describe any service that is not otherwise subject to the 
tax. 
The amendment amends 2 service provider tax exemptions to make the same changes 
that the bilI made for parallel sales tax exemptions for child care facilities and certain 
church-affiliated residential homes. 
The amendment adds a cross-reference that was inadvertently omitted in language 
requiring the State Police to take or cause to be taken certain fingerprints.
