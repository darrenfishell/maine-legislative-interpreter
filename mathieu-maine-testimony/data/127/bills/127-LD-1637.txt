 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  23 MRSA §3026, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 1981, c. 683, §1, is amended 2 
to read:  3 
1.  General procedures; maintenance of public easement.   A municipality may 4 
terminate in whole or in part a ny interests held by it for highway purposes.  A 5 
municipality may discontinue a town way or public easement after the municipal officers 6 
have given best practicable notice to all abutting property owners and the municipal 7 
planning board or office and have filed an order of discontinuance with the municipal 8 
clerk that specifies the location of the way, the names of abutting property owners and the 9 
amount of damages, if any, determined by the municipal officers to be paid to each 10 
abutter.  11 
Upon approval of th e discontinuance order by the legislative body, and unless otherwise 12 
stated in the order, a public easement shall , in the case of town ways, must  be retained 13 
and all remaining interests of the municipality shall  pass to the abutting property owners 14 
to the center of the way. If a public easement is retained and, at the time of approval of 15 
the discontinuance order, there are legal residences on the property abutting that public 16 
easement, the municipality, at the expense of that municipality, shall keep that p ublic 17 
easement reasonably passable for the use of motor vehicles for the purpose of access to 18 
the residences abutting that public easement. If a public easement is not retained, all 19 
interests of the municipality pass to the abutting property owners to the center of the way 20 
and the municipality is not responsible for maintenance of that discontinued town way.  21 
For purposes of this section, the words "public easement" shall  include, without 22 
limitation, an easement for public utility facilities necessary to pro vide service.  23 
Sec. 2.  23 MRSA §3202 is repealed and the following enacted in its place:  24 
§3202.  Mail routes  25 
If a municipality holds a right -of-way over which there is a mail route, it is the 26 
responsibility of that municipality to keep the mail route to t he standard required by 27 
United States Postal Service regulations.  28 
SUMMARY  29 
This bill requires a municipality that discontinues a town way but that retains a public 30 
easement on that town way to continue to maintain that public easement, at the expense 31 
of the  municipality, so that it is reasonably passable by motor vehicles if there are legal 32 
residences on the property abutting the town way at the time of discontinuance.  If a 33 
municipality discontinues a town way and specifically discontinues the public easeme nt 34 
on that town way, the interests of the municipality pass to the abutting property owners to 35 
the center of the town way and the municipality is not required to keep the town way 36 
passable. As defined in current law, a town way includes a county way not di scontinued 37 
prior to July 29, 1976.  38

way held by the municipality to the standard required by United States Postal Service 2 
regulations.  3
