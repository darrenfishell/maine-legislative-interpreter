organization that organizes tournament -style cribbage games, and that is exempt from 12

the principal organizer has been a member of that organization for a period of not less 14 
than 3 years.  15 
B.  The minimum number of players allowed is 75.  16 
C.  The super cribbage tournament need not be held on premises owned by the 17
