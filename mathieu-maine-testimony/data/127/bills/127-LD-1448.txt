SUMMARY  26 
This bill gives the Commissioner of Education the authority to designate a school 27 
administrative unit to enroll a student when the student's school administrative unit 28 
neither maintains a school nor contracts with another school administrative unit a nd no 29 
school administrative unit enrolls the student voluntarily.  For a student receiving special 30 
education services, the bill requires a resident school administrative unit to pay to the 31 
receiving school administrative unit tuition, special education tui tion, other costs directly 32 
related to the student's special education and costs associated with due process 33 
proceedings for providing a free, appropriate public education.  34 
This bill makes the following changes to the laws relating to public charter schools . 35 
1.  The bill allows charter schools authorized by a local school board or a 36 
collaborative among local school boards to give enrollment preference to residents of the 37 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR2071(01) -1 
 school administrative unit or units whose school board or school boards authorized the 1 
charter school.  2 
2.  The bill extends the submission deadline for a charter school authorizer's annual 3 
report to the Commissioner of Education from 60 to 90 days after the end of the school 4 
fiscal year and adds language to address the disposition of graduati on records and records 5 
of other students not transitioning to another Maine public school if a charter school 6 
closes.  7 
3.  The bill adds language to reflect that charter schools are subject to educator 8 
effectiveness requirements.  9 
4.  The bill provides that the compulsory attendance laws apply to virtual charter 10 
schools.  11 
5.  The bill allows the Commissioner of Education to designate the school 12 
administrative unit that is responsible for oversight of the individualized education 13 
program of a child with a disab ility who is a state ward and is placed in an out -of-state 14 
residential treatment center by the Department of Health and Human Services.  15 
6.  For a charter school in a school administrative unit with an enrollment of 500 or 16 
fewer students, current law caps t he number of students from the school administrative 17 
unit that the charter school may enroll during its first 3 years of operation at 5% of the 18 
school administrative unit's noncharter public school students per grade level.  The bill 19 
provides that if 5% of  the school administrative unit's noncharter public school students 20 
per grade level is less than one, the charter school may enroll one student from the school 21 
administrative unit per grade level in each of the charter school's first 3 years of 22 
operation.  23
