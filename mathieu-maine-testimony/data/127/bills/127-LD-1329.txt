 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, wind energy development has the potential to significantly affect the 3 
State's environment and quality of place assets; and  4 
Whereas, the process for approving the siting of wind energy development needs to 5 
be modified immediately to ensure appropriate factors are considered; and  6 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 7 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 8 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 9 
therefore,  10 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follo ws: 11

§20, is further amended to read:  26 
3.  Commission authority.   The commission may direct investor -owned 27 
transmission and distribution utilities to enter into long-term contracts for:  28 
A.  Capacity  Firm capacity  resources;  29 
B.  Any available firm energy associated with firm capacity resources contracted 30 
under paragraph A:  31 
(1)  To the extent necessary to fulfill the policy of subsection 2, paragraph A; or  32 
(2)  If the commission determines appropriate for purposes of supplying or 33 
lowering the cost of standard -offer service or otherwise lowering the cost of 34 
electricity for the ratepayers in the State.  Available energy contracted pursuant to 35 
this subparagraph must be  firm and energy  may be sold into the wholesale 36 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 electricity market in conjunction with solicitations for standard -offer supply bids; 1 
and 2 
C.  Any available renewable energy credits associated with firm capacity resources 3 
contracted under paragraph A.  The p rice paid by the investor -owned transmission 4 
and distribution utility for the renewable energy credits must be lower than the price 5 
received for those renewable energy credits at the time they are sold by the 6 
investor -owned transmission and distribution ut ility. 7 
The commission may permit, but may not require, investor -owned transmission and 8 
distribution utilities to enter into contracts for differences that are designed and intended 9 
to buffer ratepayers in the State from potential negative impacts from tran smission 10 
development.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures 11 
for long -term contracts for investor -owned transmission and distribution utilities under 12 
this subsection having the same legal and financial effect as the proce dures used for 13 
standard -offer service pursuant to section 3212 for investor -owned transmission and 14 
distribution utilities.  15 
The commission may enter into contracts for interruptible,  demand response or energy 16 
efficiency capacity resources.  These contracts are not subject to the rules of the State 17 
Purchasing Agent.  In a competitive solicitation conducted pursuant to subsection 6, the 18 
commission shall allow transmission and distribution utilities to submit bids for 19 
interruptible or  demand response capacity r esources.  20 
Capacity  Firm capacity  resources contracted under this subsection may not exceed the 21 
amount necessary to ensure the reliability of the electric grid of this State, to meet the 22 
energy efficiency program budget allocations articulated in the trienn ial plan as approved 23 
by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 4 or any annual update plan 24 
approved by the commission pursuant to section 10104, subsection 6 or to lower 25 
customer costs as determined by the commission pursuant to rules adopted  under 26 
subsection 10.  27 
Unless the commission determines the public interest requires otherwise, a firm capacity 28 
resource may not be contracted under this subsection unless the commission determines 29 
that the firm capacity resource is recognized as a capacity  resource for purposes of any 30 
regional or federal capacity requirements.  31 
The commission shall ensure that any long -term contract authorized under this subsection 32 
is consistent with the State's goals for greenhouse gas reduction under Title 38, section 33 
576 and the regional greenhouse gas initiative as described in the state climate action plan 34 
required in Title 38, section 577.  35 
Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3210 -C, sub -§4, as amended by PL 2007, c. 293, §3, is 36 
further amended to read:  37 
4.  Priority of firm capacity res ources.   In selecting capacity resources for 38 
contracting pursuant to subsection 3, the commission shall apply the following standards.  39 
A.  The commission shall select firm capacity resources that are competitive and the 40 
lowest price when compared to other available offers for capacity resources of the 41 
same or similar contract duration or terms.  42

located in this State;  4 
(2)  New renewable firm capacity resources located in this State ; 5 
(3) New firm capacity resources with no net emission of greenhouse gases;  6 
(4)  New nonrenewab le firm capacity resources located in this State . The 7 
commission shall give preference to new nonrenewable firm capacity resources 8 
with no net emission of greenhouse gases;  9 
(5)  Capacity  Firm capacity  resources that enhance the reliability of the electric 10 
grid of this State.  The commission shall give preference to capacity resources 11 
with no net emission of greenhouse gases; and  12 
(6)  Other firm capacity resources.  13 
Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §3210 -C, sub -§6, as amended by PL 2009, c. 518, §4, is 14 
further amended to r ead: 15 
6.  Competitive solicitation process and contract negotiation.   Except as provided 16 
in paragraph A, for purposes of selecting potential firm capacity resources for contracting 17 
pursuant to subsection 3, the commission shall conduct a competitive solicit ation no less 18 
often than every 3 years if the commission determines that the likely benefits to 19 
ratepayers resulting from any contracts entered into as a result of the solicitation process 20 
will exceed the likely costs.  Following review of bids, the commis sion may negotiate 21 
with one or more potential suppliers.  When only one bid has been offered, the 22 
commission shall ensure that negotiations are based on full project cost disclosure by the 23 
potential supplier.  The commission shall negotiate contracts that are commercially 24 
reasonable and that commit all parties to commercially reasonable behavior.  25 
A.  The commission shall, for purposes of selecting energy efficiency capacity 26 
resources and available energy associated with such resources for contracting 27 
pursua nt to subsection 3, conduct a competitive solicitation in accordance with this 28 
subsection or contract with the Efficiency Maine Trust established in section 10103 29 
to deliver those resources through a competitive solicitation process administered by 30 
the tru st. 31 
Sec. 7.  35-A MRSA §3210 -C, sub -§11, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 413, §3, is 32 
amended to read:  33 
11.  Customer benefits.  The commission may direct investor -owned transmission 34 
and distribution utilities to enter into contracts under this section only as age nts for their 35 
customers and only when such contracts are in the best interest of customers and in 36 
accordance with this subsection. The commission shall adopt rules to ensure that:  37 
A.  To the extent the benefits to ratepayers of a long -term contract are pro jected to 38 
occur in the later years of the contract term, the commission shall ensure that 39 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 adequate financial security is in place so that it is reasonably likely ratepayers will 1 
obtain the projected benefits of the long -term contract; and 2 
B.  To the extent  practicable, ratepayers obtain the benefit of lower cost firm capacity 3 
resources of energy associated with those resources or of any renewable energy 4 
credits that may exist after the term of primary financing or subsequent replacement 5 
financing necessary for the development and construction of a generation project is 6 
completed .; and  7 
C.  Contracts for capacity are only for firm capacity resources.  8 
Sec. 8.  35-A MRSA §3402, as amended by PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. A, §2 and PL 9 
2011, c. 682, §38, is further amended  to read:  10 
§3402.  Legislative findings  11 
The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to explore opportunities for and  12 
encourage access to and  the development, where appropriate, of wind  renewable  energy 13 
production in the State  in a manner that is  consistent with all state and federal 14 
environmental standards and that achieves reliable, cost -effective, sustainable energy 15 
production on those sites in the State that will attract investment and permit the 16 
development of viable wind energy projects .  Th e Legislature finds that the access to 17 
renewable energy resources and the  development of the wind  renewable  energy potential 18 
in the State  needs to be integrated into the existing energy supply and transmission 19 
systems in a way that achieves system reliabil ity, total capital cost -effectiveness and 20 
optimum short -term and long -term benefits to Maine people.  The Legislature finds it is 21 
in the public interest to encourage the construction and operation of community wind 22 
power generation facilities in the State.   For the purposes of this chapter, "community 23 
wind power generation facility" means an electricity -generating facility at any one site 24 
with instantaneous generating nameplate capacity of not more than 10 megawatts that is 25 
powered entirely by wind energy.   The Legislature also finds it is in the public interest to 26 
encourage wind  renewable  energy research and the development of wind  renewable 27 
energy  generation equipment manufacturing facilities in the State.  28 
1.  Contribution of renewable energy development.  The Legislature finds and 29 
declares that the wind energy resources of the State constitute a valuable indigenous and 30 
renewable energy resource and that wind energy development, which is unique in its 31 
benefits to and impacts on the natural environment, make s a significant contribution to 32 
the general welfare of the citizens of the State for the following reasons:  33 
A.  Wind energy is an economically feasible, large -scale energy resource that does 34 
not rely on fossil fuel combustion or nuclear fission, thereby di splacing electrical 35 
energy provided by these other sources and avoiding air pollution, waste disposal 36 
problems and hazards to human health from emissions, waste and by -products; 37 
consequently, wind energy development may address energy needs while making a 38 
significant contribution to achievement of the State's renewable energy and 39 
greenhouse gas reduction objectives, including those in Title 38, section 576;  40 
B.  At present and increasingly in the future with anticipated technological advances 41 
that promise to  increase the number of places in the State where grid -scale wind 42 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 energy development is economically viable, and changes in the electrical power 1 
market that favor clean power sources, wind energy may be used to displace 2 
electrical power that is generated f rom fossil fuel combustion and thus reduce our 3 
citizens' dependence on imported oil and natural gas and improve environmental 4 
quality and state and regional energy security; and  5 
C.  Renewable energy resources within the State and in the Gulf of Maine have the 6 
potential, over time, to provide enough energy for the State's homeowners and 7 
businesses to reduce their use of oil and liquid petroleum -fueled heating systems by 8 
transition to alternative, renewable energy -based heating systems and to reduce their 9 
use of petroleum -fueled motor vehicles by transition to electric -powered motor 10 
vehicles.  Electrification of heating and transportation has potential to increase the 11 
State’s energy independence, to help stabilize total residential and commercial energy 12 
bills and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  13 
2.  Need for modification of regulatory process for siting wind energy 14 
developments.  The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to reduce the 15 
potential for controversy regarding  improve the process for the siting and permitting  of 16 
grid-scale wind energy development by expediting development in places where it is 17 
most compatible with existing patterns of development and resource values when 18 
considered broadly at the landscape level  by ensuring against und ue environmental and 19 
economic impacts from wind energy developments both individually and cumulatively .  20 
Accordingly, the Legislature finds that certain aspects of the State's regulatory process for 21 
determining the environmental and economic  acceptability of wind energy developments 22 
should be modified to encourage the siting of wind energy developments in these  areas 23 
that best serve the State .  Such changes include, but are not limited to:  24 
A.  Making wind energy development a permitted use within certain pa rts of the 25 
State's unorganized and deorganized areas;  26 
B.  Refining certain procedures of the Department of Environmental Protection and 27 
the Maine Land Use Planning Commission; and 28 
C.  Because the Legislature recognizes that wind turbines , including the rel ated 29 
excavation, construction practices and transmission infrastructure,  are potentially a  30 
highly visible feature  features  of the landscape that will diminish landscape values 31 
and have an impact on views and the quality of place assets , judging the effects  of 32 
wind energy development on scenic character and existing uses related to scenic 33 
character based on whether the development significantly compromises views from a 34 
scenic resource of state or national significance such that the development has an 35 
unreaso nable adverse effect on the scenic character or existing uses related to the 36 
scenic character of that resource . and, together with other similar development, an 37 
adverse effect on the scenic character of the State; and  38 
D.  Because the Legislature recognizes  that electricity produced from wind energy 39 
may have a potentially detrimental effect on ratepayers, judging the effects of wind 40 
energy development on electric rates and charges, both on an individual development 41 
and cumulative basis.  42 
The Legislature furt her finds that , while  wind energy may be developed at many sites 43 
with minimal site -specific environmental impacts, wind energy developments  may have , 44 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 in addition to their beneficial  environmental effects , economic  and potential  scenic 1 
impacts, both specifi c adverse environmental effects  and cumulative,  that must be 2 
addressed in state permitting decisions pursuant to approval criteria tailored to address 3 
issues presented by wind energy development.  Nothing in this section is meant to 4 
diminish the importance  of addressing as appropriate site -specific and cumulative  impacts 5 
on quality of place assets and  natural values, including, but not limited to, wildlife, 6 
wildlife habitats and other ecological values.  7 
The Legislature further finds that development of the State's wind or other renewable  8 
energy resources should be undertaken in a manner that ensures significant tangible 9 
benefits to the people of the State, including, but not limited to, ratepayers, taxpayers and  10 
residents of communities that host wind energy  facilities;  and that the State should seek to 11 
host a substantial amount of  or seek consumer access to  wind or other renewable  energy , 12 
if economically and environmentally appropriate,  as part of a strategy to reduce 13 
greenhouse gas emissions and meet the go als established in the state climate action plan 14 
developed pursuant to Title 38, section 577.  15 
For purposes of this section, "quality of place assets" means those exceptional, 16 
marketable, place -based competitive strengths, resources and advantages that driv e the 17 
local and regional economy and its sustainability, including sustainable economic 18 
activities based on natural resources, including farming, fishing, forestry, nature -based 19 
and heritage -based tourism and outdoor recreation and leisure, and landscapes,  including 20 
the working landscapes of farms, forests and waterfronts.  21 
3.  Energy efficiency for home heating and transportation.  The Legislature finds 22 
that conversion or replacement energy fuel sources for powering motor vehicles and for 23 
heating well -insul ated residential and commercial buildings may enhance energy 24 
independence, reduce energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  25 
Sec. 9.  35-A MRSA §3403, sub -§3, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 693, §5 and 26 
affected by §37, is amended to read:  27 
3.  Certificati on.  The commission may certify a person as a community wind power 28 
generator if the commission determines that such a certification would support 29 
construction of a community wind power generation facility in this State and that the 30 
person will be the owner  of that facility. The person must demonstrate to the commission 31 
that the construction of the community wind power generation facility would not be 32 
likely to occur absent the availability of the benefits under Title 36, section 1760, 33 
subsection 89 and Titl e 36, sections 2017 and 5219 -CC. The commission may not certify 34 
a person as a community wind power generator with respect to a community wind power 35 
generation facility for which the person commenced the site permit application process 36 
prior to August 23, 2 006.  For the purposes of this subsection, "community wind power 37 
generation facility" means an electricity -generating facility at any one site with 38 
instantaneous generating nameplate capacity of not more than 10 megawatts that is 39 
powered entirely by wind e nergy.  40 
Sec. 10.  35-A MRSA §3404, as amended by PL 2009, c. 615, Pt. A, §§3 and 4, is 41 
further amended to read:  42 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 §3404.  Determination of public policy; energy generation goals  1 
1.  Encouragement of energy development.  It is the policy of the State to ensure  2 
consumer access to viable energy resources outside the State and, in addition,  in 3 
furtherance of the goals established in subsection 2, to encourage the attraction  explore 4 
the economic viability and environmental impact  of appropriately sited development 5 
related to wind  renewable  energy, including any additional transmission and other energy 6 
infrastructure needed to transport additional offshore wind energy to market, consistent 7 
with all state environmental standards; the permitting and financing of wind  renewable  8 
energy projects; and the siting, permitting, financing and construction of wind  renewable  9 
energy research and manufacturing facilities.  10 
2.  State wind energy generation goals.  The To the extent necessary to meet state 11 
energy needs and to the exte nt viable when compared with other available renewable 12 
energy generation resources to meet those needs, the  goals for wind energy development 13 
in the State are that there be:  14 
A.  At least 2,000  Up to 400  megawatts of installed capacity by 2015 ;. 15 
B.  At leas t 3,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2020, including 300 megawatts 16 
or more from generation facilities located in coastal waters, as defined by Title 12, 17 
section 6001, subsection 6, or in proximate federal waters; and  18 
C.  At least 8,000 megawatts of i nstalled capacity by 2030, including 5,000 19 
megawatts from generation facilities located in coastal waters, as defined by Title 12, 20 
section 6001, subsection 6, or in proximate federal waters.  21 
Sec. 11.  35-A MRSA §3451 -A is enacted to read:  22 
§3451 -A.  Require ments for developers  23 
1.  Additional requirements.  In addition to any other requirements of law, a person 24 
proposing a wind energy development shall within 30 days after making a permit filing 25 
with the primary siting authority, establish a fund to conduct t echnical analysis of the 26 
proposed wind energy development and to pay qualified experts to provide testimony 27 
regarding the proposal.  The department by rule shall establish, subject to the limit set out 28 
in Title 38, section 352, subsection 3, the amount of the fund.  Rules adopted under this 29 
paragraph are routine technical rules under Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 30 
Sec. 12.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 31 
amended to read:  32 
4.  Visual impact assessment; rebuttable presumption.  An applicant for an 33 
expedited wind energy development shall provide the primary siting authority with a 34 
visual impact assessment of the development that addresses the evaluation criteria in 35 
subsection 3 if the primary siting authority determi nes such an assessment is necessary in 36 
accordance with subsection 3.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a visual impact 37 
assessment is not required for those portions of the development's generating facilities 38 
that are located more than 3 miles, measur ed horizontally, from a scenic resource of state 39 
or national significance.  The primary siting authority may require a visual impact 40 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 assessment for portions of the development's generating facilities located more than 3 1 
miles and up to 8 miles from a sceni c resource of state or national significance if it finds 2 
there is substantial evidence that a visual impact assessment is needed to determine if 3 
there is the potential for significant adverse effects on the scenic resource of state or 4 
national significance .  Information intended to rebut the presumption must be submitted 5 
to the primary siting authority by any interested person within 30 days of acceptance of 6 
the application as complete for processing. The primary siting authority shall determine if 7 
the pres umption is rebutted based on a preponderance of evidence in the record.  8 
The primary siting authority shall make decisions under this subsection based on a 9 
preponderance of evidence in the record.  10 
Sec. 13.  35-A MRSA §3454, first ¶, as repealed and replaced  by PL 2013, c. 11 
424, Pt. A, §21, is amended to read:  12 
In making findings pursuant to Title 38, section 484, subsection 3, the primary siting 13 
authority shall  may not  presume that an expedited wind energy development provides 14 
energy and emissions -related bene fits described in section 3402 and shall make additional  15 
empirical  findings regarding other tangible benefits provided by the development as well 16 
as the environmental and economic impacts of the development .  The Department of 17 
Labor, the Governor's Office of Policy and Management, the Governor's Energy Office 18 
and the Public Utilities Commission shall provide review comments if requested by the 19 
primary siting authority.  20 
Sec. 14.  35-A MRSA §3454, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 682, §28, is 21 
further amended  to read:  22 
2.  Community benefits package requirement.  Except as provided in subsection 3, 23 
to demonstrate that an expedited wind energy development provides significant tangible 24 
benefits as required in Title 38, section 484, subsection 10, the  The applican t for an 25 
expedited wind energy development is required to establish a community benefits 26 
package valued at no less than $4,000 per year per wind turbine included in the expedited 27 
wind energy development, averaged over a 20 -year period  approved by the legis lative 28 
body of the host community or communities and memorialized as a written agreement 29 
with the host community or communities .  This subsection does not affect the property 30 
tax obligations of an expedited wind energy development.   There is a lien on real  estate of 31 
an expedited wind development located in a host community to secure the receipt by that 32 
host community of all benefits due to that host community under the agreement, which 33 
lien takes precedence over all other claims on such real estate, excepti ng only claims for 34 
taxes.  35 
Sec. 15.  35-A MRSA §3457, sub -§3 is enacted to read:  36 
3.  Decommissioning plans.  The department shall adopt rules to require that 37 
decommissioning plans be submitted to and approved by the department as a condition of 38 
approval in all grid -scale wind energy development. These rules must include, at a 39 
minimum, requirements for full funding for the removal of all components of the wind 40 
energy development, vegetative restoration of the development area and maintenance of 41 
public safety and environmental protection during decommissioning. The department 42 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR1776(01) -1 
 shall require a written guaranty in the form of a performance bond from a 3rd -party 1 
guarantor that ensures sufficient funding of all decommissioning costs regardless of the 2 
point in histor y of the development at which decommissioning becomes necessary, based 3 
on the department's decommissioning standards in force at the time of application.  4 
Sec. 16.  38 MRSA §352, sub -§3, as amended by PL 2011, c. 653, §10 and 5 
affected by §33 and amended by c. 657, Pt. W, §5, is further amended to read:  6 
3.  Maximum fee.  The commissioner shall set the actual fees and shall publish a 7 
schedule of all fees by November 1st of each year.  If the commissioner determines that a 8 
particular application, by virtue of i ts size, uniqueness, complexity or other relevant 9 
factors, is likely to require significantly more costs than those listed on Table I, the 10 
commissioner may designate that application as subject to special fees.  Such a 11 
designation must be made at, or prior  to, the time the application is accepted as complete 12 
and may not be based solely on the likelihood of extensive public controversy.  The 13 
maximum fee for processing an application may not exceed $250,000, except that the 14 
maximum fee for processing an appli cation under chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 9 is as 15 
provided for in subsection 4 -A.  In the case of a wind energy development, the fee plus 16 
the amount of the fund required by Title 35 -A, section 3451 -A, subsection 1 may not 17 
exceed a total of $1,000,000.   All staff of the department, the Department of Inland 18
