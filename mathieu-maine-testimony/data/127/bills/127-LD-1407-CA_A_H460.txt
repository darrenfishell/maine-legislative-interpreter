SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is Report A of the committee, removes the sections of the 
bill that repeal provisions that prohibit the State's denying food assistance and Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, benefits to a person who has been convicted of a 
drug-related felony. It specifies that a person receiving TANF benefits who has been 
convicted of a drug-related felony and is within 20 years of that person's date of 
conviction is not able to reapply for cash assistance if the person fails a drug test, declines 
to enter a treatment plan or fails to meet the requirements of the treatment plan. It 
requires the Department of Health and Human Services to apply the same process to a 
person receiving food benefits who was convicted of a drug-related felony and is within 
20 years of that person's date of conviction.

An Act To Require Screening and Testing for Illegal Substances of Beneficiaries under the Temporary

Fiscal Note for Bill as Amended by Committee Amendment if ( H ---1U0 
Committee: Health and Human Services 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Current biennium savings -Federal Block Grant Fund 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill adds a drug screening and testing component to the eligiblity requirements for Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrional Assistance Program (SNAP). The provisions of this bill were 
recently added to the TANF rules, so there is no fiscal impact to that program. There is an expectation that the biggest 
savings will be to the Federally funded SNAP benefits, but as these benefits do not pass through State accounts, there 
would be no state savings. There will be an increase in costs for administering the drug screening and for additional 
drug testing, however the actual cost is unable to be determined at this time. The SNAP expenditures related to drug 
testing and screening would be split 50/50 to the General Fund and Federal Fund Food Supplement Administrative 
accolirif The 'separate SNAP prograin, which is 100% state funded, would see benefit savings, but these savings are 
expected to be less than the new costs, to the General Fund.
