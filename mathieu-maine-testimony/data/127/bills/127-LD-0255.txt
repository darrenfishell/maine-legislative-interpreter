This bill in creases the fine for a person who commits a civil violation of interfering 12 
with the ability of a person who holds a municipal shellfish aquaculture permit to carry 13 
out the privileges granted under the permit.  The fine is changed from not less than $100 14 
nor more than $500 to not less than $500 nor more than $2,000.  The bill specifies that 15 
the area in which the interference is prohibited is the intertidal zone in the area that is 16 
included in the permit.  The bill also clarifies that the prohibited action in cludes 17 
disturbing or molesting shellfish, not only the taking of shellfish.  18
