2. Coverage for rental equipment permitted. Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this Title, a rental company may offer for sale an insurance policy insuring against the 
loss of or damage to covered rental equipment under a covered rental agreement.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
amendment reallocates section 1 of the bill, which allows a rental company to offer for 
sale an insurance policy insuring against the loss of or damage to equipment rented for 
personal or household purposes, to the appropriate subchapter of the Maine Insurance 
Code. The amendment establishes a licensing structure for equipment rental insurance 
that is the same as the licensing structure for insurance sold in connection with renting a 
motor vehicle. The amendment requires rental companies to obtain a business entity 
license to sell insurance in connection with renting equipment and requires at least one 
employee at each office of the rental company located in the State to obtain a limited 
lines insurance producer license. The amendment also adds provisions to clarify that the 
insurance sold in connection with rental equipment is a limited lines insurance product 
and applicants for a license to sell that insurance product are exempt from examination.
