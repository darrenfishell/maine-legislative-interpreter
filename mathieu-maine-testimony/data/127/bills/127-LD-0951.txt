the offender to appear for a court hearing . 17 
1-A.  For purposes of this section, if an offend er is returned to court pursuant to a 18 
warrant, both the court located where the warrant is issued and the court located where 19 
the warrant is executed are authorized to conduct the default hearing pursuant to 20 
subsection 3.  21 
2.  A probation officer having kno wledge of a default in payment of a fine by an 22 
offender shall report the default to the office of the attorney for the State.  An attorney for 23 
the State having knowledge of a default in payment of a fine by an offender shall report 24

mail to the offender's last known address.  If the offender does not appear for the hearing 32 
after proper notification has been sent, the court may issue a bench warrant. A court need 33

 Page 3 - 127LR1656(01) -1 
 to a fai lure on the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds 1 
required for the payment, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and may:  2 
(1)  Commit the offender to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part 3 
of the f ine is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcused 4 
default must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 months.  An 5 
offender committed for nonpayment of a fine is given credit toward the payment 6 
of the fine for each day o f confinement that the offender is in custody at the rate 7 
specified in the court's order, which may not be less than $25 or more than $100 8 
of unpaid fine for each day of confinement.  The offender is also given credit for 9 
each day that the offender is deta ined as the result of an arrest warrant issued 10 
pursuant to this section. An offender is responsible for paying any fine remaining 11 
after receiving credit for confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining 12 
fine is also governed by this section; or  13 
(2)  If the unexcused default relates to a fine imposed for a Class D or Class E 14 
crime, as authorized by chapter 53, order the offender to perform community 15 
service work, as authorized in chapter 54 -C, until all or a specified part of the 16 
fine is paid.  The number of hours of community service work must be specified 17 
in the court's order and the offender must receive a credit against the unpaid fine 18 
of no less than $25 for every 8 hours  the minimum wage under Title 26, section 19 
664, subsection 1 for each hour  of community service work completed, which 20 
may not exceed one hundred 8 -hour days.  An offender ordered to perform 21 
community service work pursuant to this subparagraph is given credit toward the 22 
payment of the fine for each 8 -hour day of community service w ork performed at 23 
the rate specified in the court's order.  The offender is also given credit toward the 24 
payment of the fine for each day that the offender is detained as a result of an 25 
arrest warrant issued pursuant to this section at a rate specified in t he court's order 26 
that is up to $100 of unpaid fine per day of confinement.  An offender is 27 
responsible for paying any fine remaining after receiving credit for any detention 28 
and for community service work performed.  A default on the remaining fine is 29 
also governed by this section.  30 
B.  If it appears that the default is excusable, the court may give the offender 31 
additional time for payment, may reduce the amount of the fine, may reduce the 32 
amount of  each installment or may permit the offender to perform comm unity service 33 
work at a rate authorized by paragraph A, subparagraph (2), supervised by the sheriff 34 
of the county in which the court that assessed the fine is located or by a community 35 
confinement monitoring agency with which that sheriff has contracted un der Title 36 
30-A, section 1659 -A. 37

authorize, at the time of its order only, participation of the p erson in a project under 40 
Title 30 -A, section 1606 with the agreement of the sheriff of the county jail where the 41 
person is committed.  The person must be given credit according to Title 30 -A, 42 
section 1606, subsection 2.  43

 Page 4 - 127LR1656(01) -1 
 4.  Upon any default, execution may be levied and other measures authorized for the 1 
collection of unpaid civil judgments may b e taken to collect the unpaid fine.  A levy of 2 
execution does not discharge an offender confined to a county jail or performing 3 
community service work under subsection 3 for unexcused default until the full amount 4 
of the fine has been collected.  5 
5.  When a  fine is imposed on an organization, the person or persons authorized to 6 
make disbursements from the assets of the organization shall pay the fine from the 7 
organization's assets.  Failure to do so may subject the person or persons to court action 8 
pursuant to this section.  9 
Sec. 10.  30-A MRSA §1606, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2013, c. 519, §9, is 10 
further amended to read:  11 
2.  Sentence prorated.   Inmates participating in a public works -related project or an 12 
improvement of property owned by a charitable organizat ion under this section may have 13 
their sentences to the jail prorated at the rate of up to one day removed from the sentences 14 
for every 16 hours of participation in the project , except that inmates committed to the 15 
custody of the sheriff for nonpayment of f ines under Title 17 -A, section 1304 must have 16 
their sentences prorated at the rate that is applicable to the individual inmate pursuant to 17 
Title 17 -A, section 1304, subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (1) . 18
