22 This amendment changes the schedule by which payment of the employment tax 
23 increment to the Loring Job Increment Financing Fund must be made. Instead of paying 
24 100% of the employment tax increment to the fund in December of each year as the bill 
25 proposes, this amendment requires that 50% of the employment tax increment be paid to 
26 the fund in December of each year and the remaining 50% be paid to the fund in July of 
27 the following year. The bill also limits the payment of the increased employment tax 
28 increment amounts to 5 years and requires a report from the Loring Development 
29 Authority of Maine to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction 
30 over taxation matters in 2021. The committee is authorized to submit a bill to the First 
31 Regular Session of the I 30th Legislature regarding the report.
