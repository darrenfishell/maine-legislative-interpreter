Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub -§2, ¶D is enacted to read:  17 
D.  "Waste energy resource" means a pyrolytic or other waste system that is a source 18 
of electrical generation and:  19 
(1)  That is fueled by municipal solid waste in conjunction with recycling;  20 
(2)  Whose total power production capacity does not exceed 35 megawatts;  21 
(3)  That is licensed to comply with the air emission requirement levels for 22

(4)  That complies with all applicable licensing requirements for solid waste 26 
facilities as established pursuant to Title 38, section 1310 -N; and 27 
(5)  Whose residuals are transported to a landfill that is licensed to meet at least 28 
the performance standards and siting criteria established by rules adopted 29 
pursuant to Title 38, section 1304, including, but not limited to, standards 30 
prohibiting con tamination of groundwater outside the solid waste boundary of 31 
landfills.  32 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub -§3-B is enacted to read:  33 
3-B.  Portfolio requirements; waste energy resources.  Portfolio requirements for 34 
waste energy resources are governed by this su bsection.  35 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0072(01) -1 
 A.  Beginning July 1, 2016, as a condition of licensing pursuant to section 3203, a 1 
competitive electricity provider in this State must demonstrate in a manner 2 
satisfactory to the commission that no less than 3.5% of its portfolio of supply 3 
sourc es for retail electricity sales in this State is accounted for by waste energy 4 
resources.  Waste energy resources used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph 5 
may not be used to satisfy the requirements of subsection 3.  6 
B.  Retail electricity sales p ursuant to a supply contract or standard -offer service 7 
arrangement executed by a competitive electricity provider that is in effect on the 8 
effective date of this subsection are exempt from the requirements of this subsection 9 
until the end date of the curre nt term of the supply contract or standard -offer service 10 
arrangement.  11 
The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant 12 
to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 13 
2-A. 14

further amended to read:  16 
8.  Credit trading.  The commission shall allow competitive electricity providers to 17 
satisfy the portfolio requirements of subsections 3 and, 3-A and 3 -B through the use of 18 
renewable energy credits if the commission determines that a reliable system of electrical 19 
attribute trading exists. When renewable energy credits are used to satisfy the portfolio 20 
requirements of subsections 3 and, 3-A and 3 -B, the va lue of a renewable energy credit 21 
for electricity generated by a community -based renewable energy project, as defined in 22 
section 3602, that is participating in the community -based renewable energy pilot 23 
program established in section 3603 and elects the ren ewable energy credit multiplier 24 
under section 3605 is 150% of the amount of the electricity.  25 
Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3210, sub -§10 is enacted to read:  26 
10.  Alternative compliance payment; portfolio requirements for waste energy 27 
resources.  The commission shall  allow competitive electricity providers to satisfy the 28 
portfolio requirements for waste energy resources under subsection 3 -B through an 29 
alternative compliance payment mechanism in accordance with this subsection.  30 
A.  The commission shall set the alternat ive compliance payment rate by rule and 31 
shall publish the alternative compliance payment rate by January 31st of each year. In 32 
setting the rate, the commission shall take into account prevailing market prices, 33 
standard -offer service prices for electricity and reliance on alternative compliance 34 
payments to meet the requirements of subsection 3 -B. 35 
B.  The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments made by 36 
competitive electricity providers and shall deposit all funds collected under this 37 
paragrap h in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund established under 38 
section 10121, subsection 2 to be used to fund research, development and 39 
demonstration projects relating to renewable energy technologies and to fund rebates 40 
for cost -effective renewa ble energy technologies.  41

SUMMARY  4 
Current law establishes as a policy of  the State the encouragement of the generation 5 
of electricity from renewable and efficient resources by requiring that each competitive 6 
electricity provider in this State demonstrate that no less than 30% of its portfolio of 7 
supply sources for retail elect ricity sales in this State is accounted for by eligible 8 
resources.  This bill implements that policy by stimulating demand for electricity from 9 
generators fueled by municipal solid waste in conjunction with recycling.  10 
This bill amends the law in the follow ing ways.  11 
1.  It amends the definition of "renewable capacity resource" to add waste energy 12 
resources.  13 
2.  It defines "waste energy resource" as a source of electrical generation that is 14 
fueled by municipal solid waste in conjunction with recycling and who se total power 15 
capacity does not exceed 35 megawatts.  In addition, the waste energy resource would 16 
have to meet Maine's air emissions standards for resource recovery facilities and licensing 17 
standards for solid waste facilities and ensure that residuals f rom the waste energy 18 
resource are disposed of at a landfill meeting Maine's licensing standards.  19 
3.  It establishes a 3.5% portfolio requirement for electricity from waste energy 20 
resources.  21 
4.  It allows competitive electricity providers to meet the portfo lio requirements for 22 
waste energy resources through the use of renewable energy credits or an alternative 23 
compliance payment to be set by the Public Utilities Commission.  24
