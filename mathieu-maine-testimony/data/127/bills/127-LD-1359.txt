4.  Municipal solid waste.   "Municipal solid waste" means the solid waste c ollected 17 
by a governmental entity customer that remains after the program of reuse, reduction, 18 
recycling and composting certified under section 2422, subsection 2 and that is sent to a 19 
participating waste -to-energy facility for processing and conversion in to electricity.  20 
5.  Net electrical billing credits.   "Net electrical billing credits" means the monetary 21 
credits that must be applied by an electrical utility to the monthly electricity bill of a 22 
governmental entity customer that has earned those credits b y sending municipal solid 23 
waste to a participating waste -to-energy facility for conversion into electricity pursuant to 24 
a contract under section 2242, subsection 1.  25 
6.  Participating waste -to-energy facility.   "Participating waste -to-energy facility" 26 
means  a solid waste disposal facility licensed by the department that converts municipal 27 
solid waste to electricity through incineration, reduces the volume of the municipal solid 28 
waste it processes by at least 80% and the weight by at least 65% and is not a pa rty to a 29 
power purchase agreement entered into pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies 30 
Act of 1978, United States Code, Title 16, Section 2601, et seq.  31 
§2242.  Solid waste management net electrical billing program  32 
1.  Contracts.  A participating  waste -to-energy facility may develop, offer and enter 33 
into a contract to convert a governmental entity customer's municipal solid waste to 34 
electricity and to provide net electrical billing credits to a governmental entity customer 35 
based upon the number of  metered kilowatt -hours produced by such conversion.  A 36 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1967(01) -1 
 contract authorized under this subsection must be certified by the department as 1 
complying with the provisions of this subchapter.  2

3.  Metering.  A contract entered into pursuant to subsection 1 must require the 9 
collection of electricity pro duction and consumption information through the use of 2 10 
types of metering:  11 
A.  Metering by generation meters registering the flow of electricity produced 12 
through the incineration of municipal solid waste at a participating waste -to-energy 13 
facility; and  14 
B.  Metering by consumption meters registering the consumption of electricity by a 15 
governmental entity customer.  16 
4.  Annual electrical crediting calculation.   A participating waste -to-energy facility 17 
shall annually report to the department and the Public Uti lities Commission its calculation 18 
of its municipal solid waste to electricity conversion factor, which is the average number 19 
of kilowatt -hours of electricity generated from the processing of one ton of municipal 20 
solid waste, determined by dividing the tota l electrical power generated by the facility in 21 
processing municipal solid waste, according to generation metering under subsection 3, 22 
by the total number of tons of municipal solid waste processed during the prior year.  The 23 
participating waste -to-energy facility shall certify the calculation under this subsection 24 
and provide the calculation to the department and the Public Utilities Commission on or 25 
before a date determined by the department.  26

energy facility shall provide to an electrical utility that provides electric service to a 33 
governmental entity cust omer a report identifying the number of net electrical billing 34 
credits earned during the preceding billing cycle by each governmental entity customer 35 
that receives electric service from that electrical utility.  A participating waste -to-energy 36 
facility sha ll provide to each governmental entity customer a report identifying the 37 
number of net electrical billing credits earned by that customer.  An electrical utility shall 38 
enter into a contract with a participating waste -to-energy facility and each governmenta l 39

 7.  Application of electrical billing credits.   An electrical utility shall apply reported 1 
net electrical billing credits for a governmental entity customer on the customer's next 2 
monthly electricity bill.  Credits may be applied only to either the standard offer service 3 
charge or competitive energy supplier charge on the electricity supply billing portion of 4 
the governmental entity customer's monthly electricity bill.  Credits on a monthly 5

SUMMARY  20 
This bill provides that a municipality that operates a program of solid waste reuse, 21 
reduction, recycling and composting may send municipal solid waste to a waste -to-energy 22 
facility and receive credits on the municipality's electricity bill for the electricity that is 23 
generated from the incineration of the municipal solid waste.  24
