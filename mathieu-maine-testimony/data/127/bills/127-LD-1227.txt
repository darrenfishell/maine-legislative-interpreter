SUMMARY  14 
This bill changes the marine resources licensing laws to facilitate the expansion of the 15 
use of the transaction card system for electronic dealer reporting that was successfully 16 
implemented in Maine's elv er fishery in 2014.  Specifically, it provides that an individual 17 
who holds a dealer's license may be required to obtain equipment specified by the 18 
Department of Marine Resources in order to engage in licensed activities.  Additionally, 19 
it specifies that i n the sea urchin and scallop fisheries the license holder must be the 20 
individual who sells the harvested product.  This change is necessary because only the 21 
license holder will be issued a transaction card.  22 
It also prohibits a holder of a wholesale seafood  license from dealing in scallops 23 
without the holder's obtaining from the Commissioner of Marine Resources a scallop 24 
permit, which permits the holder to buy scallops from harvesters and to sell, process, ship 25 
or transport scallops.  26
