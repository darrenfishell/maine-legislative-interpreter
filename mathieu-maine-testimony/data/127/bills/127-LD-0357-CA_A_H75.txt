Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -Efficiency Maine Trust 
The bill requires the Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT) study options for a state demand response program producing 
electricity consumer and electrical grid benefits and submit a report of its study to the Legislature by February 1, 
2016. The EMT has indicated that this study will cost between $30,000 and $50,000 and that it already has sufficient 
resources available to cover the cost. Any additional costs to the Governor's Energy Office, Public Utilities 
Commission and Office of the Public Advocate to consult with the EMT are expected to be minor and can be 
absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
