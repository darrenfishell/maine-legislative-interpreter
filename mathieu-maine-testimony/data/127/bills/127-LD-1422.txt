 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, Maine residents benefitted until recently from a Maine law that allowed 3 
importation of pre scription drugs from pharmacies in other countries; and  4 
Whereas, a federal court ruled that the Maine law was in violation of federal law, a 5 
ruling that could cause many residents, including senior citizens and low -income 6 
residents, to forgo their medicati on because it is too costly; and  7 
Whereas, this legislation, based on federal guidance regarding the personal 8 
importation of prescription drugs, allows the importation of certain prescription drugs 9 
from certain countries; and  10 
Whereas, this legislation needs  to take effect as soon as possible to provide some 11 
relief to those Maine residents who can no longer afford their prescription drugs; and  12 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 13 
the meaning of the Constitution o f Maine and require the following legislation as 14 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 15 
therefore,  16

SUMMARY  27 
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act, the importation of unapproved new 28 
prescription drugs, including foreign -made versions of prescription drugs that have been 29 
approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration, is prohibited.  However, the Food 30 
and Drug Administration has de veloped guidance that allows the personal importation of 31 
certain drugs.  32 
This bill, using the guidance developed by the Food and Drug Administration, enacts 33 
the Maine Pharmaceutical Drug Safety Act to allow an individual in Maine to import 34 
prescription drug s from Canada or certain member countries of the European Union for 35 
use by that individual or a member of that individual's immediate family.  The country 36 
from which the prescription drug is to be imported must meet specific criteria regarding 37 
regulation o f its pharmacies and pharmacists, as determined by the United States 38 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1930(01) -1 
 Secretary of State.  The prescription drug to be imported must also meet specific 1 
requirements.  The importation of controlled substances and prescription drugs for sale or 2 
resale is spec ifically prohibited.  3
