SUMMARY 
The bill enacts the Toxic Chemicals in the Workplace Act. This amendment, which 
is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research 
and Economic Development, makes a number of changes to the bill, including the 
following: 
1. Expands the definition of "employer" to include employers engaged in 
employment activities involving the use, handling or storage of chemicals and employers 
with workplaces constructed of materials or including equipment that release highly toxic 
chemicals that pose a health risk to employees; 
2. Removes the requirement for the Department of Labor to designate toxic and 
highly toxic chemicals to be regulated by the Act, and instead further defines highly toxic 
chemicals and directs employers to identify them. The department is required to publish 
on its publicly accessible website lists of online resources that identify highly toxic 
chemicals; 
3. Requires an employer to contact chemical suppliers and manufacturers for 
possible safer chemical alternatives and to implement a process for permanent transition 
to the safer alternative chemicals. If the employer elects not to use safer alternative 
chemicals, the employer must submit a report to the Department of Labor detailing the 
basis for not proceeding with the transition to the safer alternative; 
4. Requires employers to complete a self-audit for compliance with this Act; and 
5. Requires annual employee training that follows the United States Department of 
Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration's globally harmonized system of 
classification and labeling of chemicals.
