closed except when adding containers of post-consumer paint that have been 
collected from consumers. A collection container must be labeled with the words 
"Waste Paint." A collection site may not store more than 5~000 kilograms of post­
consumer paint that is a hazardous waste at anyone time. A collection site may store 
collected post-consumer paint that is a hazardous waste for up to one year. 
E. A collection site may accept post-consumer paint that is a hazardous waste only

F. A collection site shall immediately contain and clean up any discharge or release 
of post-consumer paint that is a hazardous waste.

consumer paint, except that transfer stations and operations that otherwise collect 
household hazardous waste may remove post-consumer paint that is a hazardous 
waste from the paint's original container and mix or consolidate that paint, as long as 
all transfer and mixing or consolidation activities are conducted over secondary 
containment and as long as any discharges or releases of hazardous waste, as defined 
in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 261, Subparts C and D, are contained and 
cleaned up to the department's satisfaction.

issued by the producer or representative organization.

universal waste consolidation facility or to a recycling, treatment, storage or disposal 
facility that is authorized to receive universal waste. 
J. A collection site that accepts only post-consumer paint and post-consumer paint 
that is a hazardous waste under an approved plan from households and from 
conditionally exempt small quantity generators is not a central accumulation facility 
and does not require a hazardous waste identification number from the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency. Nothing in this section is intended to exempt a 
collection site from being considered a central accumulation facility or from being 
required to obtain a hazardous waste identification number based on activities 
unrelated to a paint stewardship program. 
Sec. 9. 38 MRSA §2144, sub-§6, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 395, §1, is amended
