a casino in either Washington County or Aroostook County, the operation of wh ich is 14 
stated to maximize economic and employment benefits for the 4 federally recognized 15 
Indian tribes in the State.  The bill establishes the Casino Development Commission, 16

by the Senate.  The commission's purpose is to develop a request for proposals for the 18 
privilege to submit an application to the Gambling Control Board for a casino operator 19 
license.  Prior to the commission's submitting a request for proposals for a cas ino operator 20 
license in either Washington County or Aroostook County, voters would have to approve 21 
the operation of a casino by a countywide referendum.  The referendum must be held on 22 
the same date as a statewide election and no sooner than June 1, 2016 a nd no later than 23 
July 1, 2017.  The fee to submit a bid to the commission is $100,000.  The bill provides 24

commission including the bidder's ability to make a minimum $2 0,000,000 capital 26 
investment in the casino and partnership with at least 2 federally recognized Indian tribes 27 
in the State.  28 
Under the bill, the commission is directed to develop a point system for the factors to 29 
be considered in evaluating proposals and gi ve priority to proposals that maximize the 30 
employment and economic benefits to federally recognized Indian tribes in the State.  The 31 
winning bidder must enter into a contract with the commission that obligates the casino 32 
operator to abide by the proposals made in the winning bid.  Failure to abide by the terms 33 
of the contract could result in financial penalties to the operator.  34

Fiscal Detail and Notes
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for a casino to a single 
applicant. Bidders will pay a $100,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. Any bidding fees will be credited to the General Fund. The Gambling Control Board will accept an application for a casino license in either Aroostook County or Washington County from the winning bidder as long as the voters of the county where the proposed casino will be located have voted to approve a casino. Only one casino, in either Aroostook or Washington County, may be licensed.
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 46% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. The bill requires a 
casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital improvements to the casino using 2% to 3% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct those funds to the Gambling Control Board. This fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the Gambling Control Board. The bill limits the number of slot machines to 250 for the first 3 years of the casino's operation, then allows 350 slot machines after that. 250 slot machines and 10 table games for the first 3 years of the casino's operation would generate estimated annual revenue of $7,166,711 credited to the Gambling Control Board. 350 slot machines and 10 table games starting in the fourth year of the casino's operation would generate estimated annual revenue of $9,804,000 for the Gambling Control Board. This revenue will be retained within the board until the Legislature decides on a distribution.If Washington and Aroostook counties choose to hold referendums during the state primary election in June 2016, the 
Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $11,772 for ballot printing costs and postage.  If the counties elect to hold referendums during the general election in November 2016, the Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $14,464 for ballot printing costs and postage only if the questions require printing a separate ballot.127th MAINE LEGISLATURE
