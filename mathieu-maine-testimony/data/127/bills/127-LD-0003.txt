Whereas, public charter schools are not currently required to implement curricula 7 
designed to enable students to demonstrate proficiency in certain areas to award diplomas 8

Whereas, public charter schools are publicly funded alternatives to public schools 10

Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 19 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 20 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 21 
therefore, 22 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 23 
Sec. 1.  20 -A MRSA §6202, first ¶, as amended by PL 2009, c. 313, §20, is 24

evaluate on a continuing basis the academic achievements of students in grades 3 to 12 on 27 
the accountability standards set forth in section 6209 and in department rules 28 
implementing that section and other curricular requirements.  The commissioner may 29 
elect to provide for the use of alternative measures of student achievement in grades 9 to 30 
12.  This assessment applies to students in the public elementary and secondary schools , 31 
in public charter schools, as that term is defined in section 2401, subsection 9, and in all 32 
private schools approved for tuition whose school enrollments include at least 60% 33 
publicly funded students, as determined by the previous school year's October and April 34 
average enrollment.  The assessment program must be adapted to meet the needs of 35

 Sec. 2.  20-A MRSA §6209, first ¶, as amended by PL 2009, c. 647, §1, is further 1 
amended to read: 2 
The department in consultation with the state board shall establish and implement a 3 
comprehensive, statewide system of learning results, which may include a core of 4 
standards in English language arts and mathematics for kindergarten to grade 12 5 
established in common with the other states, as set forth in this section and in department 6 
rules implementing this section and other curricular requirements. The department must 7 
establish accountability standards at all grade levels in the areas of mathematics; reading; 8 
and science and technology. The department shall establish parameters for essential 9 
instruction and graduation requirements in English language arts; mathematics; science 10 
and technology; social studies; career and education development; visual and performing 11 
arts; health, physical education and wellness; and world languages.  Only students in a 12 
public school, a public charter school as defined in section 2401, subsection 9 or a private 13 
school approved for tuition that enrolls at least 60% publicly funded students, as 14 
determined by the previous school year's October and April average enrollment, are 15 
required to participate in the system of learning results set forth in this section and in 16 
department rules implementing this section and other curricular requirements.  The 17 
commissioner shall develop accommodation provisions for instances where course 18 
content conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs and practices of a student's parent or 19 
guardian.  The system must be adapted to accommodate children with disabilities as 20 
defined in section 7001, subsection 1-A 1-B. 21 
Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 22 
legislation takes effect when approved. 23 
SUMMARY 24 
This bill makes demonstrated proficiency in the system of learning results a 25 
requirement for the award of a diploma indicating graduation from a public charter 26 
school, in order to match the requirements for public schools and private schools 27 
approved for tuition that enroll at least 60% publicly funded students.  This bill also 28 
makes the statewide assessment program required under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 29 
20-A, section 6202 applicable to public charter schools. 30
