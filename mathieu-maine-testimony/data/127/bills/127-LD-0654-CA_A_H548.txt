Allowing detectives employed in the Office of the Attorney General on or after July 1, 2016 to participate in the 1998 
Special Plan of the Maine Public Employees Retirement System will increase both the normal cost and unfunded 
actuarial liability components of the employer retirement rate, resulting in increased employer contributions to the 
Maine Public Employees Retirement System for detectives beginning in fiscal year 2016-17. 
This legislation includes a transition provision for those detectives hired by the Office of the Attorney General prior to 
July 1, 2016 which allows these employees to elect to participate in the 1998 Special Plan within 180 days of the 
effective date of this Act, assumed to be on or around August 1, 2016. Based on an analysis performed by the Maine 
Public Employees Retirement System, this fiscal note assumes that 5 of the 11 eligible detectives will elect to 
participate in the 1998 Special Plan as soon as the option becomes available and the remaining 6 detectives will 
choose to remain in the State Regular Plan. This bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $3,984 in fiscal year 
2016-17, a Federal Expenditures Fund allocation of $12,324 in fiscal year 2016-17 and an Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocation of $3 ,984 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Office of the Attorney General for the cost associated with 
moving 5 positions to the 1998 Special Plan 
When the 6 eligible detectives that are expected to choose to remain in the State Regular Plan eventually retire or 
otherwise vacate their positions any newly hired detectives will be placed in the 1998 Special Plan. The additional 
cost to the Office of the Attorney General to fill these positions at the higher employer contribution rate is estimated 
to be between $3,500 and $4,000 per position annually. When this additional cost will be incurred and which fund 
will be impacted can not be determined at this time.
