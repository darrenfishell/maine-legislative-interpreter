SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority committee amendment to the bill. It retains the 
structure of the bill that legalizes personal use of marijuana by adults 21 years of age and 
older, that establishes a system of regulation of marijuana establishments and marijuana 
transportation providers within the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations and that imposes a tax of 10% on 
retail sales of marijuana and marijuana products. The amendment does the following. 
1. It amends taxation provisions in the bill to provide the structure for the payment of 
taxes and administration by the Bureau of Revenue Services. 
2. It corrects the confusing use of the tenn "minor" in the bill, which was intended to 
cover persons through 20 years of age, by referring to persons too young to be allowed 
personal use of marijuana as "underage persons." 
3. It provides maximum penalties for underage persons with respect to the purchase, 
cQnsumption and possession of marijuana and with respect to other prohibited acts related 
to marijuana. It allows a judge to assign an underage person to perfonn specified work 
for a public entity or charitable institution as an alternative to these penalties. 
4. In the provisions on possession of marijuana it reduces from 6 to 3 the number of 
marijuana seedlings that a person may transfer to another person, clarifies that the limit of 
6 plants applies to all plants and requires that the reasonable precautions that must be 
taken to keep marijuana plants from underage persons apply to storing and securing 
marijuana. 
5. It amends the provision prohibiting marijuana sales from vending machines by 
allowing sales from vending machines inside a retail marijuana store. 
6. It amends the provisions on applications for marijuana establishments and 
marijuana transportation providers to comply with the requirement that the location of the 
business be a municipality, unorganized place or plantation that has voted to allow such 
businesses and provides the option of that jurisdiction to limit the number of businesses. 
7. It amends the provisions on operation of a retail marijuana store, a marijuana 
product manufacturing facility and a commercial marijuana cultivation facility. 
8. The amendment makes technical editing and typographic corrections in the bill. 
9. It amends the bill's labeling requirements for retail sales of marijuana and 
marijuana products.
