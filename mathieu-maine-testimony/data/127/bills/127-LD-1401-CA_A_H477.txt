This legislation legalizes the sale of cannabis and cannabis products and establishes a 10% tax rate in addition to the

fiscal year 2016-17 and Local Government Fund revenue would increase by $139,500 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$232,500 in fiscal year 2016-17. This analysis assumes an effective date of 10-1-15. The Department of 
Administrative and Financial Services would require a General Fund appropriation of$12,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 
for computer programming to add a line to the sales tax return to capture the tax information.
