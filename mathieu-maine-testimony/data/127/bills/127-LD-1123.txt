Any penalty of less than $10 is waived.  12 
Violations accumulate on reports with filing deadlines in a 2 -year period that begins on 13 
January 1st of each even -numbered calendar year.  Waiver of a penalty does not nullify 14 
the finding of a violation.  15 
A report required to be filed under this subchapter that is sent by certified or registere d 16 
United States mail and postmarked at least 2 days before the deadline is not subject to 17 
penalty.  18 
A required report may be provisionally filed by transmission of a facsimile copy of the 19 
duly executed report to the commission, as long as an original of the  same report is 20 
received by the commission within 5 calendar days thereafter.  21 
Sec. 21.  21-A MRSA §1125, sub -§12-A, ¶E, as amended by PL 2013, c. 334, 22 
§34, is further amended to read:  23 
E.  A contemporaneous document such as an invoice , contract  or timesheet  that 24 
specifies in detail the services provided by a vendor who was paid in excess of $500 25 
for the election cycle for providing campaign staff or consulting services to a 26 
candidate.  If the candidate compensates or expects to compensate the vendor $2,000 27 
or more during the election cycle, the invoice or timesheet must specify the dates on 28 
which services were provided and the number of hours actually worked during that 29 
time period.  Purchases of goods made by the vendor with the candidate's campaign 30 
funds on  behalf of the candidate do not count toward the $2,000 threshold.  31 
SUMMARY  32 
This bill amends the laws governing campaign finance and the Commission on 33 
Governmental Ethics and Election Practices by:  34 
1.  Providing the commission discretion to decline to condu ct an investigation 35 
requested by an outside party, if the violation is alleged to have occurred more than 3 36 
years before the investigation is requested.  This proposed change would not restrict the 37 
commission's discretion to initiate an investigation of it s own accord;  38

 2.  Allowing the commission to refer to the Attorney General potential violations of 1 
criminal law rather than requiring the commission to refer all violations of the laws 2 
governing campaign reports and finances;  3 
3.  Amending the requirements for state party committees to provide mailing 4 
addresses for local committee chairs to the commission for purposes of receiving 5 
correspondence from the commission;  6

committees;  13 
6.  Providing an exemption from filing primary election campaign finance rep orts for 14 
legislative candidates who file a sworn statement with the commission that they will not 15 
conduct financial activity for the primary election.  This exemption would be available 16 
only to those candidates with no opponent in the primary election and would not exempt 17 
candidates from filing campaign finance reports for the general election;  18 
7.  Permitting candidates to donate unspent campaign contributions to a political 19 
action committee or ballot question committee;  20 
8.  Repealing the requirement for a candidate with a campaign surplus or deficit to 21

next campaign;  24 
9.  Amending the  threshold for filing an independent expenditure report from $100 to 25 
$250;  26

other paid communication that is the subject of the report;  29 
11.  Increasing the potential penalty for an individual's failure to register as a 30 
candidate with the commission from $10 to $100;  31 
12.  Amending the formula used to determine the penalty when a campai gn finance 32 
report is filed late to provide that the penalty is based on the amount of financial activity 33 
reported late rather than on the total financial activity for the period;  34 
13.  Allowing candidates and political committees to request a determination by the 35 
commission regarding a preliminary penalty through an unsworn communication such as 36 
a letter or memo rather than through a sworn statement;  37

initiative and other referendums;  3 
15.  Requiring political action committees to register with the commission within 7 4 
days of receiving contributions or making expenditures above the applicable thres hold for 5 
the purpose of influencing Maine elections.  Under current law, the registration 6 
requirement is triggered only by expenditures made to influence Maine elections;  7 
16.  Prohibiting a political action committee from compensating a Legislator or 8 
membe r of the Legislator's immediate family or household for services provided to the 9

19.  Requiring campaign staff and consultants who are compensated for their labor by 21 
candidates with $2,000 or more in Maine Clean Election Act funds to create an invoice or 22 
timesheet s howing the dates of service and number of hours worked, to be kept by the 23
