 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1

Whereas, certain tax laws need to be updated before the 90 -day period expires to 3 
ensure the timely preparation and publication of tax administration guidance to taxpayers 4 
for tax periods beginning in 2015 and 2016; and  5 
Whereas, legislative action is immediately necessary to ensure timely and efficient 6 
administration of the state income and sales taxes; and 7 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 8 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 9 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now , 10 
therefore,  11

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes the following changes to the Maine tax laws.  2 
1.  It removes an obsolete reference to the Circuitbreaker Progra m and updates 3 
references to the recently enacted individual income tax rate schedules that apply to tax 4 
years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.  5 
2.  It revises, for purposes of simplification, the municipal reimbursement and state 6 
valuation calculation s for the homestead property tax exemption.  7 
3.  It clarifies the application of the Maine sales tax exclusion with respect to the 8 
rental or lease of equipment associated with the provision of cable services, satellite 9 
television services and satellite radi o services.  10 
4.  It eliminates, beginning with the 2016 tax year, the credits for employer -assisted 11 
day care and employer -provided long -term care benefits to bring the insurance premiums 12 
tax law in line with the elimination of the same credits in the income  tax law by the 13 
biennial budget, Public Law 2015, chapter 267.  Carry -over of unused credit amounts is 14 
still allowed.  15 
5.  It specifies that, in calculating the pension income deduction for tax years 16 
beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the offset is limi ted to social security and railroad 17 
retirement benefits, rather than also applying the offset to a taxpayer's retirement plan 18 
benefits.  19 
6.  It specifies that Maine itemized deductions are capped at $28,350 for tax years 20 
beginning in 2015.  The cap is adjus ted annually for inflation for tax years beginning after 21 
2015.  It further clarifies that the annual cost -of-living adjustment is based on the most 22 
recently published Chained Consumer Price Index, which is published monthly by the 23 
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, at the time the annual 24 
cost-of-living adjustment is required to be made.  25
