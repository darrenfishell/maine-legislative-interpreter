 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  5 MRSA c. 337 -D is enacted to read:  2 
CHAPTER 337 -D 3 
PRESERVATION OF RELI GIOUS FREEDOM ACT  4 
§4801.  Short title  5 
This chapter may be known and cited as "the Preservation of Religious Freedom  6 
Act."  7 
§4802.  Findings  8 
The Legislature makes the following findings:  9 
1.  Federal Constitution.   The framers of the United States Constitution, recognizing 10 
free exercise of religion as a fundamental and unalienable right, secured its protection in 11 
the Firs t Amendment of the United States Constitution;  12 
2.  State Constitution.   The framers of the Constitution of Maine, recognizing free 13 
exercise of religion as a fundamental and unalienable right, secured its protection in the 14 
Constitution of Maine;  15 
3.  Exercis e of religion burdened.   Laws neutral toward religion may burden 16 
exercise of religion as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise;  17 
4.  Compelling government interest.   Government should not burden the free 18 
exercise of religion without a  compelling governmental interest;  19 
5.  Effect of Supreme Court precedent.   Prior to 1990, the United States Supreme 20 
Court recognized that laws burdening the free exercise of religion had to be justified by a 21 
compelling governmental interest.  In Employment  Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 22 
(1990), the United States Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the 23 
government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward 24 
religion;  25 
6.  Reassertion of compelling interest test.   The compelling interest test set forth in 26 
this Act and in federal as well as Maine court rulings prior to Employment Division v. 27 
Smith, including Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 28 
U.S. 398 (1963), is a workable test for st riking sensible balances between religious liberty 29 
and competing governmental interests; and  30 
7.  Role of legislative bodies to protect free exercise of religion.   The United States 31 
Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao  do 32 
Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), indicates that legislative bodies may enact statutory law for 33 
their jurisdictions requiring that laws burdening the free exercise of religion be justified 34 
by a compelling governmental interest. Many states have done so, pa ssing laws similar to 35 
this Act.  36

The purposes of this Act are:  2 
1.  Application of compelling interest test.  To restore the compelling interest test 3 
as set forth in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 4 
398 (1963), and to guarantee its application in all cases in which the free exercise of 5 
religion is substantially burdened; and  6 
2.  Provide claim or defense.  To provide a claim or defense to a person or persons 7 
whose exercise of religion is substantially b urdened.  8

religious belief.  18 
3.  Government.   "Government" means the State, a political subdivision of the State 19 
and any local government, municipality , instrumentality or public official authorized by 20 
law in the State.  21 
4.  Substantially burden.   "Substantially burden" means taking an action, including 22 
the implementation or application of a law, that directly or indirectly constrains, inhibits, 23 
curtails or denies the exercise of religion by a person or compels an action contrary to a 24 
person's exercise of religion.  "Substantially burden" includes, but is not limited to, 25 
withholding benefits from a person, assessing criminal, civil or administrative penalt ies 26

1.   Substantial burden prohibited; exceptions.   Government may not substantially 29 
burden a person's exercise of religion, eve n if the burden results from a rule of general 30 
applicability, unless applying the burden to that person's exercise of religion in this 31

A.  Is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and  33 
B.  Is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.  34 
2.  Claim or defense; relief.   A person whose exercise of religion has been 35 
substantially burdened in violation of this Act may assert the violation as a claim or 36 
defense in a judicial proceeding.  The p erson asserting such a claim or defense may 37

 obtain appropriate relief, including relief against the government.  Appropriate relief 1 
includes, but is not limited to, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, compensatory damages 2 
and costs and attorney's fees.  3 
SUMMARY  4 
This bill enacts the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act.  It codifies legislative 5 
findings that summarize the enshrinement of the right to the free exercise of religion in 6 
the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Maine and case law  of the Maine 7 
Supreme Judicial Court and the United States Supreme Court interpreting the 8 
fundamental and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion, as well as the extent to 9 
which a legislative body can legislate in this area.  10 
The Preservation of Religious Freedom Act has as its purpose the restoration of the 11 
compelling interest test as set forth in Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205 (1972), and 12 
Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S. 398 (1963).  The Act guarantees the application of the 13 
compelling interest te st in all cases in which the government substantially burdens the 14 
exercise of religion and provides a claim or defense to a person whose exercise of 15 
religion is burdened by the government.  16 
The Act provides that the government may not directly or indirectly  substantially 17 
burden a person's exercise of religion unless the application of the burden to the person is 18 
in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is accomplished through the 19 
least restrictive means.  20 
The Act allows a person whose exercise  of religion has been substantially burdened 21 
in violation of the Act to assert the violation as a claim or defense in a court action.  22 
The Act's requirement that the government's infringement upon the free exercise of 23 
religion be justified by a compelling i nterest is similar to the requirement placed on the 24 
Federal Government through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and that of 25 
other states that have passed similar protections.  26
