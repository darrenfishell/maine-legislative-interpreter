'An Act To Allow Out-of-state Tuition Students To Enroll in Public Charter 
Schools' 
Amend the bill in section 1 in paragraph J in the 2nd and 3rd lines (page 1, lines 5 
and 6 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "full capacity under the public charter 
school's application under section 2407 or if' and inserting the following: 'capacity under

Amend the bill in section 2 in paragraph C in the 4th and 5th lines (page 1, lines 14 
and 15 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "full capacity under the public charter 
school's application under section 2407 or if' and inserting the following: 'capacity under 
the public charter school's application under section 2407 and' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 3. 
SUMMARY 
TIllS amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment clarifies 
that a public chaner school may enroll students from outside the State and accept tuition 
for those students if there is space available because the public charter school did not 
reach its capacity under the public charter school's application and the public charter 
school's proposed vision and plans according to the public charter school's application 
would be enhanced by the attendance of students from outside the State. 
The amendment strikes the provision in the bill that allows a public charter school to 
operate in association with a private school if the public charter school complies with the 
provisions in law conceming public charter schools, the public charter school's operations 
comply with the public charter school's contract and the public charter school's finances 
are accounted for separately from the finances ofthe pdvate school.
