 Preamble.  Two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature deeming it necessary in 1

direction of the Governor, to issue bonds in the name and on behalf of the State in an 7 
amount not exceeding $20, 000,000 for the purposes described in section 5 of this Act.  8 
The bonds are a pledge of the full faith and credit of the State.  The bonds may not run for 9 
a period longer than 10 years from the date of the original issue of the bonds.  10 
Sec. 2.  Records of b onds issued; Treasurer of State. The Treasurer of State 11 
shall ensure that an account of each bond is kept showing the number of the bond, the 12 
name of the successful bidder to whom sold, the amount received for the bond, the date of 13 
sale and the date when p ayable.  14 
Sec. 3.  Sale; how negotiated; proceeds appropriated.  The Treasurer of State 15 
may negotiate the sale of the bonds by direction of the Governor, but no bond may be 16 
loaned, pledged or hypothecated on behalf of the State.  The proceeds of the sale of the 17 
bonds, which must be held by the Treasurer of State and paid by the Treasurer of State 18 
upon warrants drawn by the State Controller, are appropriated solely for the purposes set 19 
forth in this Act.  Any unencumbered balances remaining at the completion o f the project 20 
in this Act lapse to the Office of the Treasurer of State to be used for the retirement of 21 
general obligation bonds.  22 
Sec. 4.  Interest and debt retirement.  The Treasurer of State shall pay interest 23 
due or accruing on any bonds issued under t his Act and all sums coming due for payment 24 
of bonds at maturity.  25 
Sec. 5.  Disbursement of bond proceeds.    The proceeds of the bonds must be 26 
expended as set out in this Act under the direction and supervision of the Department of 27 
Agriculture, Conservatio n and Forestry.  28 
1. The proceeds of the bonds for the Land for Maine's Future Board as set out in 29 
section 6 must be expended by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 30 
for acquisition of land and interest in land for conservation, water acc ess, outdoor 31 
recreation, wildlife or fish habitat, farmland preservation in accordance with the 32 
provisions for such acquisitions under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 33 
and working waterfront preservation in accordance with the terms of Publ ic Law 2005, 34 
chapter 462, Part B, section 6, including all costs associated with such acquisitions, 35 
except that use of the proceeds of these bonds is subject to the following conditions and 36 
requirements.  37 
A. Hunting, fishing, trapping and public access may not be prohibited on land 38 
acquired with bond proceeds, except to the extent of applicable state, local or federal 39 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1246(01) -1 
 laws, rules and regulations and except for working waterfront projects and farmland 1 
protection projects.  2 
B. Payment from bond proceeds for acq uisitions of local or regional significance, as 3 
determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board, may be made directly to 4 
cooperating entities as defined in Title 5, section 6201, subsection 2 for acquisition of 5 
land and interest in land by cooperating enti ties, subject to terms and conditions 6 
enforceable by the State to ensure its use for the purposes of this Act. In addition to 7 
the considerations required under Title 5, chapter 353, the board shall give a 8 
preference to acquisitions under this paragraph tha t achieve benefits for multiple 9 
towns and that address regional conservation needs including public recreational 10 
access, wildlife, open space and farmland.  11 
C. The bond funds expended for conservation, recreation, working waterfront, 12 
farmland and water acce ss must be matched with at least $20,000,000 in public and 13 
private contributions. Seventy percent of that amount must be in the form of cash or 14 
other tangible assets, including the value of land and real property interest acquired 15 
by or contributed to coop erating entities, as defined in Title 5, section 6201, 16 
subsection 2, when property interests have a direct relationship to the property 17 
proposed for protection, as determined by the Land for Maine's Future Board. The 18 
remaining 30% may be matching contribut ions and may include the value of project - 19 
related, in -kind contributions of goods and services to and by cooperating entities.  20 
D. Because portions of the State have deer populations that are struggling and deer 21 
wintering habitat protection is vital to the survival and enhancement of these 22 
populations, projects that conserve and protect deer wintering areas are considered to 23 
have special value and must receive preferential consideration during scoring of new 24 
applications for support under Title 5, chapter 35 3. 25 
E. Of the bond proceeds allocated to the Land for Maine’s Future Board, $2,000,000 26
