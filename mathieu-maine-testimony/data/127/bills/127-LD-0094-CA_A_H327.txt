26,000 pounds and for Class A special mobile equipment, as defined in Title 
29-A, section 101, subsection 70, is based on the purchase price in the original 
year of title rather than on the list price. Verification of purchase price for the 
application of excise tax is determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales 
tax document provided at point of purchase. The initial bill of sale is that issued 
by the dealer to the initial purchaser of a new vehicle. 
(4) For buses manufactured in model year 2006 and after, the amount of excise 
tax due is based on the purchase price in the original year of title rather than on 
the list price. Verification of purchase price for the application of excise tax is 
determined by the initial bill of sale or the state sales tax document provided at 
point of purchase. The initial bill of sale is that issued by the dealer to the initial 
purchaser of a new vehicle. 
(5) For trucks or truck tractors registered for more than 26,000 pounds that have 
been reconstructed using a prepackaged kit that may include a frame, front axle 
or body but does not include a power train or engine and for which a new 
certificate of title is required to be issued, the amount of excise tax due is based 
on the maker's list price of the prepackaged kit. 
For motor vehicles being registered pursuant to Title 29-A, section 405, subsection 1, 
paragraph C, the excise tax must be prorated for the number of months in the 
registration. '

This bill proposes to reduce excise tax payments paid on motor vehicles by basing them on 90% of the maker's list 
price effective January 1,2017. This will decreas~ General Fund revenue by $15,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 related to 
excise tax paid by out of state residents. It will also result in a decrease in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to 
the Department of Administrative and Financial Services of $66,500 in fiscal year 2016-17 related to excise tax paid 
in the unorganized territories. It will also allow an Other Special Revenue Funds deallocation to the Secretary of State 
of $130,000 in fiscal year 2017-18 since reimbursement to municipalities through the Municipal Excise Tax 
Reimbursement Fund will be decreased. Under current statute, the amount remaining in this fund at the end of the 
year is transferred to the Highway Fund. Since payments deposited into the Municipal Excise Tax Reimbursement 
Fund through the International Registration Plan will not change under this legislation, but the reimbursement to 
municipalities will decrease, the amount transferred to the Highway Fund will increase Highway Fund revenues by 
$130,000 in fiscal year 2017-18. 
It is estimated that excise tax revenues to municipalities will decrease by approximately $21 million annually.
