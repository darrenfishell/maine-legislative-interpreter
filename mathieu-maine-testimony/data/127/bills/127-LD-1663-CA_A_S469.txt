Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium cost increase -All Funds 
Future biennium cost increase -All Funds 
Eliminating the prohibition that a position may not be paid a salary that is greater than the maximum rate established 
in the compensation plan and permitting a one-time recruitment bonus to certain employees will increase Personal 
Service costs to the affected departments and agencies. The amount and timing of the additional costs will depend on 
specific position actions and the amount of excess funds available to support these costs within a department or 
agency. Since these authorized increases will increase the calculation of baseline budget requests, additional future 
costs are expected. No Estimates can be made at this time.
