than the mandatory fine if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there 32

A.  Reliable evidence of financial hardship on the part of the offender and the 35 
offender's family and dependents;  36 
B.  Reliable evidence of special needs of the offender or the offender's family and 37

further amende d to read:  6 
A.  Unless the offender shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the default 7 
was not attributable to an intentional or knowing refusal to obey the court's order or 8 
to a failure on the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain th e funds 9 
required for the payment, the court shall find that the default was unexcused and may:  10 
(1)  Commit the offender to the custody of the sheriff until all or a specified part 11 
of the fine is paid.  The length of confinement in a county jail for unexcus ed 12 
default must be specified in the court's order and may not exceed 6 months.  An 13

of the fine for each day of confinement that the offender is in custody at the rate 15 
specified in the court's order, which may not be less than $25 or more than $100 16 
of unpaid fine for each day of confinement.  The offender is also given credit for 17 
each day that the offender is detained as the result of an arrest warrant issued 18 
pursuant to this sect ion. An offender is responsible for paying any fine remaining 19 
after receiving credit for confinement and detention.  A default on the remaining 20 
fine is also governed by this section; or  21 
(2)  If the unexcused default relates to a fine imposed for a Class D or Class E 22 
crime, as authorized by chapter 53, order the offender to perform community 23 
service work, as authorized in chapter 54 -C, until all or a specified part of the 24 
fine is paid.  The number of hours of community service work must be specified 25 
in the c ourt's order and the offender must receive a credit against the unpaid fine 26 
of no less than $25 for every 8 hours of community service work completed, 27 
which may not exceed one hundred 8 -hour days  at a rate equal to the current 28 
hourly minimum wage .  An offe nder ordered to perform community service work 29 
pursuant to this subparagraph is given credit toward the payment of the fine for 30 
each 8 -hour day of community service work performed at the rate specified in the 31 
court's order.  The offender is also given cred it toward the payment of the fine for 32 
each day that the offender is detained as a result of an arrest warrant issued 33 
pursuant to this section at a rate specified in the court's order that is up to $100 of 34 
unpaid fine per day of confinement.  An offender is  responsible for paying any 35 
fine remaining after receiving credit for any detention and for community service 36 
work performed.  A default on the remaining fine is also governed by this 37 
section.  38 
SUMMARY  39 
This bill implements the recommendations of the Intergo vernmental Pretrial Justice 40 
Reform Task Force.  The bill does the following.  41 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR2729(01) -1 
 1.  It specifies that a bail commissioner may not set preconviction bail for crimes 1 
involving domestic violence without specifying a court date within 5 weeks of the date of 2 
the b ail order.  3 
2.  It specifies that, notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 15, section 4 
1026, subsection 3, paragraph A, subparagraph (9 -A), a bail commissioner may not 5 
impose as a condition of preconviction bail that a defendant submit to random s earch with 6 
respect to a prohibition on the possession, use or excessive use of alcohol or illegal drugs.  7 
3.  It authorizes a properly trained county jail employee to prepare and execute a 8 
personal recognizance bond when a bail commissioner orders bail.  9 
4.  It eliminates the availability of unsecured bail bonds for bail.  10 
5.  It amends standards for release on preconviction bail to include language in the 11 
conditions that specifies that a defendant refrain from the possession of alcohol and 12 
illegal drugs, in a ddition to the current condition that prohibits use or excessive use of 13 
alcohol or any drugs.  The bill also specifies that this condition be imposed only if 14 
specific facts are provided to the judicial officer to support the imposition of the 15 
condition.  16 
6.  It adds to the standards for release on preconviction bail language that a defendant 17 
be required to submit to a random search or a search upon articulable suspicion for 18 
possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons or possession or use of alcohol or 19 
illegal drugs.  20 
7.  It amends post -conviction bail to specify standards for bail with respect to a 21 
motion to revoke probation.  A judge or justice may deny or grant bail and, in 22 
determining whether to admit the defendant to bail, the judge or justice shall consider the 23 
nature of the circumstances of the crime for which the defendant was sentenced to 24 
probation and the nature of the alleged violation of and any records of prior violations of 25 
probation.  26 
8.  It repeals Title 15, section 1073 -A, which provides th at if a defendant violated a 27 
condition of bail then the person who posted the bail or the surety must have the bond 28 
released or all of the money returned, unless the person previously acted as surety for the 29 
same defendant and the defendant previously fail ed to comply with conditions.  30 
9.  It requires that in an initial proceeding on a probation violation for which a person 31 
is committed without bail pending hearing, the date of the hearing must be set no later 32 
than 45 days from the date of the initial appear ance unless otherwise ordered by the court.  33 
10.  It allows the court to suspend all or part of the minimum mandatory fine for 34 
assault, certain drug crimes and operating a motor vehicle while a person's license is 35 
suspended or revoked, and it lists criteria  that a court may consider in making the 36 
decision to suspend the fine.  37 
11.  It amends the amount of payment for community service that may be credited 38 
against the unpaid fine for offenders who have been sentenced to pay a fine and who have 39 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR2729(01) -1 
 defaulted from n o less than $25 for every 8 hours to a rate equal to the current hourly 1 
minimum wage.  2 
12.  It specifies that bail commissioners' fees must be paid for by the Judicial 3 
Department, instead of being paid for by the defendant seeking bail or by a county fund 4 
that may be created for defendants who cannot pay the fee.  5 
13.  It specifies that if a defendant is released on preconviction bail and the judicial 6 
officer imposes a condition that the person remain in the custody of a designated 7 
organization agreeing to su pervise the defendant, the State is required to reimburse the 8 
designated organization for the costs of the supervision of the defendant.  9
