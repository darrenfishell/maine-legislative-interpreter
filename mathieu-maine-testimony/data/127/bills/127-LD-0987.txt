SUMMARY  21 
This bill permits the Maine Turnpike Authority, in the case of a vehicle registered in 22 
another jurisdiction that is involved in a toll violation a nd when the authority knows only 23 
the license plate of a toll violator and not the identity of the registered owner, to send a 24 
notice of violation to the motor vehicle registry of the jurisdiction that issued the 25 
registration.  The notice must contain a war ning that if tolls are not paid, the owner's right 26 
to operate the motor vehicle in Maine may be suspended.  27 
If the registered owner of a vehicle from another jurisdiction fails to pay or contest 28 
the notice of liability, the authority is directed to notify t he Secretary of State.  The 29 
Secretary of State then suspends the right of the owner to operate the vehicle in Maine 30 
and notifies the owner, if known, or the motor vehicle registry of the jurisdiction that 31 
issued the registration.  32 
The bill also authorizes a  law enforcement officer to remove a vehicle to a suitable 33 
parking place if it is being operated under a registration that is suspended for failure to 34 
pay tolls.  35
