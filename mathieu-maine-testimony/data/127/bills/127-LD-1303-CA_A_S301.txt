The bill combines the Ground Water Oil Clean-up Fund and the Maine Coastal and Inland Surface Water Clean-up 
Fund within the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and names the combined fund the Maine Ground and 
Surface Waters Clean-up and Response Fund (Response Fund). The Response Fund will be used to respond to oil spills 
and clean-up activities, repair, retrofit, replace or remove aboveground and underground oil storage tallies, as well as 
undertake certain other activities. This bill allows the Clean-up and Response Fund Review Board to adopt rules raising 
fees on barrels of cmiain fuel if the Response Fund's balance becomes $6,000,000 or less. These fee increases terminate 
when the Response Fund's balance reaches $10,000,000. No estimate is made at this time ofthe potential amount of 
revenue that would be generated from this fee increase. Combining these two funds will not change the amount of 
revenue to the DEP. There will be total transfers of $831 ,509 and $827,736 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, 
respectively, from the Response Fund for staff time for reporting oil spills, providing the Board of Enviroiunental 
Protection with funds and other related costs. Under current law, yearly allocations may not exceed $250,000 for certain 
research and development costs and this bill places a $100,000 maximum on allocations per year. The bill includes 
Other Special Revenue Funds deallocations of $250,000 in each of fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 from projected 
savings from combining these funds and reducing the maximum amount allowed for allocations for research and 
development.
