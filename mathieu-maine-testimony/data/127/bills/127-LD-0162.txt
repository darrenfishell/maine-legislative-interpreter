SUMMARY  19 
This bill requires that any entity enacting or enforcing a land u se regulation that 20 
creates a taking of privately owned land, defined as a reduction in fair market value of the 21 
land, provide compensation in the amount of the reduction in fair market value to the 22 
owner of the land or repeal or not enforce the regulation against that owner.  The bill 23 
provides a remedy and cause of action for owners of privately owned land who are 24 
subject to a taking by a land use regulation, with a statute of limitations of 3 years of the 25 
effective date of this legislation or when a land u se regulation creating a taking is used as 26 
a criterion for approval of a land use permit application by an owner of privately owned 27 
land, whichever comes later.  Exceptions to the compensation requirements include 28 
common law nuisances, public health and sa fety protections, regulations enacted prior to 29 
the date of acquisition of the property by the owner or a family member of the owner and 30 
regulations consistent with the original intent of the United States Constitution and the 31 
Constitution of Maine.  32
