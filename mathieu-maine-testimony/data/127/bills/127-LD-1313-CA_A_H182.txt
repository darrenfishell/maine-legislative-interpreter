HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" it" to H.P. 891, L.D. 1313, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Laws Regarding Nuclear Power Generating Facilities" 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 2. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report, removes section 2 from the bill, which 
creates a threshold capacity of 500 megawatts for nuclear power plants for which a 
referendum is required as part of the siting process. The amendment maintains the 
current law, which requires a referendum for any nuclear power plant regardless of its 
generating capacity, but it leaves the provision in the bill that amends the findings section 
of the laws regarding nuclear power generating facilities.
