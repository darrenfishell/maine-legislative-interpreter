the nonfarm income official poverty line, with the 5% federal income adjustment for 
family size, and qualifies the State to receive enhanced federal funding for the cost of 
coverage of newly eligible members. It further provides for an annual expenditure cap 
for services, requiring quarterly expenditure reporting and a mechanism for terminating 
coverage if it is determined that expenditures will not remain within the cap. It also

18001, et seq., as enacted in 2010. 
Part B requires the Office of Fiscal and Program Review to study the impact of the

medical assistance percentage matching funds under the federal Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act with the goal of identifying and maximizing General Fund savings.

Part A of this bill expands medical coverage under the MaineCare program to adults who qualify under federal law 
with incomes up to 133% of the nonfarm income official poverty line, with the 5% federal income adjustment for 
family size, and the Medicaid services provided under this paragraph must be provided within the limits of the state 
and federal funds appropriated and allocated for the program budget. Part A also requires that, on a quarterly basis, the 
commissioner shall determine the fiscal status of program expenditures as a result of expansion under this paragraph 
and report the fiscal status of the program. Finally, Part A allows for the termination of the program under two 
scenarios: 1) after reporting that expenses for services provided under this subsection are anticipated to exceed the 
appropriated funds or 2) If the federal share for individuals eligible under this paragraph is reduced below the amounts 
specified in 42 United States Code, Section 1396d(y)(1). 
LR0044(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 3 
Part B of the bill as amended, includes a General Fund deappropriation of $13,000,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and 
$27,000,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 in the Executive Branch Departments and Independent Agencies -Statewide 
program in the Department of Administrative aI].d Financial Services for savings to be identified in existing programs 
as a result of the' expansion of MaineCare eligibility. Part B of the amended bill also requires the Office of Fiscal and 
Program to do an evaluation of current state programs to identify savings that would result from the MaineCare 
expansion, identifies programs and populations that may realize savings and de appropriates funds statewide. The 
specific programs and amount of savings that will be realized and distributed to each program cannot by determined at 
this time. As a benchmark, a review was done of a report on potential savings created by an outside consulting group, 
familiar with Medicaid expansions. The review noted that, though the overall saving expected were high, it lead to a 
reasonable expectation of greater than $20,000,000 million in savings annually, with the full implementation of the 
expansion, as identified in this bill. 
The bill as amended includes General Fund appropriations of $1,933,957 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $2,578,609 in 
fiscal year 2016-2017 for the Office of Family Independence -District program in the Department of Health and 
Human Services for the State share of the costs of 103 new positions to administer the MaineCare eligibility 
expansion. Funding for the new positions reflects a 75% federal match for the 79 Eligibility Specialist positions and a 
50% federal match for the other new positions. The funding for the Eligibility Specialist positions assumes a 700 
person caseload for each new position. This is the target caseload the Department of Health and Human Services has 
identified for the Eligibility Specialist positions. 
The bill as amended includes a General Fund appropriation of $9,380,367 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of 
Health and Human Services for medical costs for newly eligible childless adult population, as shown below. Federal 
Expenditures Fund allocations totaling $178,843,392 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $365,834,327 in fiscal year 2016-17 as 
shown below. The estimated appropriations and allocations assume 100 percent enhanced federal matching funds 
through December 31, 2016, 95% enhanced federal matching funds through December 31,2017,94% enhanced 
federal matching funds through December 31, 2018 and 93% enhanced federal matching funds through December 31, 
2019, for childless adult population with incomes less than 13 8% of the federal poverty line.

coverage and an additional 4,500 parents who have not had MaineCare in the past, but will opt for MaineCare 
coverage after expansion. Since this group was eligible under previous rules, they will not be considered newly eligible 
and the state will receive the Regular FMAP. The bill as amended also includes Federal Expenditures Fund allocations

fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of Health and Human Services for medical costs for the children who have not 
had MaineCare in the past, but whose family will opt for MaineCare coverage after expansion. Since these children 
were eligible under previous rules, they will not be considered newly eligible and the state will receive the enhanced 
CHIP FMAP. The bill as amended also includes Federal Expenditures Fund allocations for the children identified 
below totaling $7,633,730 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $15,267,460 in fiscal year 2016-17, as shown below, for the 
enhanced CHIP FMAP matching funds.

The bill as amended also includes deappropriations for the remaining funding in the baseline for the MaineCare costs 
of coverage for the parents population from 101 % to 138% ofthe federal poverty line. This group was covered through 
December 31,2013, with the possibility of transitional coverage extending through December 31,2014. The 
department identified a General Fund total in the baseline for spending on this population, as of May 2014, of 
$16,936,665. Of this baseline, $10,000,000 was de appropriated in PL 2013, c. 595 to fund Section 21 and 29 waitlist 
members and to increase nursing facility reimbursement rates. Since, there were no subsequent MaineCare 
appropriations or deappropriations affecting this population during the 126th Legislature, continued funding for this 
population was included in the 2016-2017 MaineCare biennial budget baseline. This bill deappropriates the remaining 
$6,936,665 that still remains in the baseline. 
Additional costs for the Legislature's Office of Fiscal and Program Review will be absorbed within existing budgeted 
resources.
