Legislative Cost/Study Fiscal Note for Senate Amendment 1,4! to Original Bill (S-Lf 515'") 
Sponsor: Sen. Haskell of Cumberland 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Delay of Legislative Cost/Study 
Removing the emergency preamble and clause from the bill will eliminate the $625 estimated fiscal year 2015-16 
general operating costs of this study and increase the fiscal year 2016-17 estimated costs by $625, resulting in an 
estimated fiscal year 2016-17 cost of $2,750. The Legislature's budget includes $10,000 in fiscal year 2016-17 for 
legislative studies. Whether this amount is sufficient to fund all studies will depend on the number of studies 
authorized by the Legislative Council and the Legislature.
