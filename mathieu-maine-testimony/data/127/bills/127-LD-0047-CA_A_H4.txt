Committee: Transportation 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Potential current biennium revenue decrease -Federal Expenditures Fund 
If this bill is enacted, the Department of Transportation (DOT) may be required to reimburse the federal government 
for the $2,205,277 in federal funds spent on the project. This repayment would be accomplished by reducing monthly 
reimbursements from the federal government for other authorized projects. DOT may then be able to re-obligate this 
funding to another federally approved project as long as the: re-obligation occurs within the same federal fiscal year. 
The result would be an extended period of time for the $2.2 million to be reimbursed to the Highway Fund.
