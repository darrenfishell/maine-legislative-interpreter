SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, replaces the bill. It 
prohibits a person 18 years of age or older from using a mobile telephone or handheld 
electronic device while operating a motor vehicle unless the mobile telephone or 
handheld electronic device allows for hands-free operation and the hands-free feature of 
the mobile telephone or electronic handheld device is in fact being used by the person or 
the mobile telephone or handheld electronic device is being used in order to communicate 
with law enforcement or emergency services personnel under emergency circumstances. 
The amendment does not affect the current prohibition against the use of a mobile 
telephone or handheld electronic device, both handheld and hands-free use, for a person 
who has been issued an intermediate driver's license or for a person under 18 years of 
age. 
The amendment establishes penalties for a violation of using a mobile telephone or 
handheld electronic device while operating a motor vehicle similar to the penalties for a 
violation of text messaging while operating a motor vehicle. The amendment provides 
that the penalty for a first offense of the prohibition against using a mobile telephone or 
handheld electronic device while operating a motor vehicle is $250. The amendment also 
provides that the penalty for a 2nd or subsequent offense within a 3-year period of the 
prohibition against using a mobile telephone or handheld electronic device while 
operating a motor vehicle is $500. It also directs the Secretary of State to suspend the 
license of a person who has been previously adjudicated for a violation of the prohibition 
against using a mobile telephone or handheld electronic device while operating a motor 
vehicle. 
The amendment also makes changes to the penalties for a violation of text messaging 
while operating a motor vehicle by providing that the current lower limit on the fine,
