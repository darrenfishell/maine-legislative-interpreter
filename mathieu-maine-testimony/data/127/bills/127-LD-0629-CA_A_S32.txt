Whereas, community paramedicine pilot projects have proven to be of value to their 
communities, and continuation is in the public interest; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as

therefore,
