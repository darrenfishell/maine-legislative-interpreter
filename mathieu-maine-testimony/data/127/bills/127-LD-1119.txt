SUMMARY  17 
In response to the Law Court decisions in Wilson v. Bath Iron Works Corp. , 2008 18 
ME 47, 942 A. 2d 1237 and Graves v. Brockw ay Smith Co. , 2012 ME 128, 55 A. 3d 456, 19 
this bill amends the law to effectuate results different from those reached by the Court.  20 
Current law provides that a petition under the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 21 
1992 is barred unless filed within 2 years after the date of injury or the date that the 22 
employer files a required first report of injury, whichever is later.  This bill specifies that 23 
this provision applies to dates of injury occurring on or after January 1, 1993.  24 
Under current law, if an employer  or insurer pays benefits under the Maine Workers' 25 
Compensation Act of 1992 within 2 years after the date of injury or the date that the 26 
employer files a required first report of injury, the period during which a petition must be 27 
filed is 6 years from the date of the most recent payment.  This bill clarifies that, for dates 28 
of injury on or after October 17, 1991, this 6 -year limitation applies regardless of whether 29 
the employer has filed a first report of injury.  This bill also provides that for dates of 30 
injury before October 17, 1991, a 10 -year limitation applies regardless of whether the 31 
employer has filed a first report of injury.  32
