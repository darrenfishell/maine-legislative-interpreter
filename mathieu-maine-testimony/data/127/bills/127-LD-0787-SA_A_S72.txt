12 SENATE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 536, L.D. 787 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the intent of the bi11 by specifying that the credit is for 
expenses paid for a dependent for adult day care, hospice services and respite care. To 
distinguish the new credit from the child care expenses credit, the adult dependent care 
expenses credit only applies to dependents who are at least 21 years of age. Also, unlike 
the child care expenses credit, the expenses do not have to be incurred to enable the 
taxpayer to be gainfully employed. Like the child care expenses credit, the expenses may 
not exceed $3,000 for one dependent or $6,000 for 2 or more dependents and the credit is 
refundable up to $500. ~. ~ 11
