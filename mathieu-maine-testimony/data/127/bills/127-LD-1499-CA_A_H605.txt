127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "{:+ .. to H.P. 1022, L.D. 1499, Bill, "An Act To 
Increase the Safety of Social Workers" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 32 MRSA §7032 is enacted to read: 
§7032. Addresses confidential 
The address and telephone number of an applicant for licensure or a person licensed 
under this chapter that are in the possession of the board are confidential. Nothing in this 
section prohibits the board and its staff from using and disclosing the address and 
telephone number of an applicant or licensee as necessary to perform the duties and 
functions of the board.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. This amendment specifies that the addresses and 
telephone numbers of applicants for licensure as well as of licensed social workers are 
confidential; the bill provides that only the home addresses of licensed social workers are 
confidential. The amendment also revises the language in the bill regarding 
confidentiality to be consistent with other references to confidential information in the 
Maine Revised Statutes. The amendment specifies that the confidentiality provision does 
not prohibit the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, State Board of 
Social Worker Li censure from using and disclosing the addresses and telephone numbers 
of applicants or licensees as necessary to perform the duties and functions of the board.
