B. "Program" means the shared savings incentive program established by a carrier 
pursuant to this section. 
2. Filing with superintendent. Prior to offering the program to any enrollee, a 
carrier shall file a description of the program established by the carrier pursuant to this 
section with the superintendent in the manner determined by the superintendent. The 
superintendent may review the filing made by the carrier to determine if the carrier's 
program complies with the requirements of this section. Upon request by a carrier before 
January I, 2018, the superintendent may grant a waiver from the requirement in 
subsection 3 that the program be made available as a component of all health plans if the 
superintendent determines that a waiver is justified on the basis of criteria specified in 
rules adopted pursuant to subsection 8. Filings and waiver requests, and any supporting 
documentation, made pursuant to this subsection are confidential until the filing has been 
reviewed or the waiver request has been granted or denied by the superintendent in the 
same manner as are form filings under section 2412, subsection 8. 
3. Availability of program; notice to enrollees. Except for a health plan offered 
through the federally facilitated marketplace established pursuant to the federal 
Affordable Care Act, a carrier shall make the program available as a component of all 
health plans offered by the carrier in this State unless a waiver has been granted by the 
superintendent in accordance with subsection 2. A carrier may make the program 
available as a component of any health plans offered by the carrier through the federally 
facilitated marketplace. Annually at enrollment or renewal, a carrier shall provide notice 
about the availability of the program to any enrollee who is enrolled in a health plan 
eligible for the program. 
4. Incentive program required. A carrier shall develop and implement a program 
that provides incentives for an enrollee in a health plan who elects to receive a 
comparable health care service that is covered by the plan from a provider that charges 
less than the average price paid by that carrier for that comparable health care service. 
A. Incentives may be calculated as a percentage of the difference in price, as a flat 
dollar amount or by some other reasonable methodology approved by the 
superintendent. The carrier may provide the incentive as a cash payment to the 
enrollee or as a reduction in the enrollee's cost sharing or premium payment. For 
services that are paid for by the enrollee under the plan's deductible provision, the 
carrier may provide the incentive by crediting a higher amount than the provider's 
actual charge toward the enrollee's deductible. 
B. The shared savings incentive program must provide enrollees with at least 40% of 
the carrier's saved costs for each service or category of comparable health care 
service. Compliance with this requirement may be demonstrated in the aggregate of 
plans offered in this State based on a reasonably anticipated mix of claims. A carrier 
is not required to provide a payment or credit to an enrollee when the carrier's saved 
cost is $50 or less. 
C. A carrier may determine the methodology for calculating the average price paid 
by the carrier for a comparable health care service and the process an enrollee must 
use to document whether the health care provider chosen by an enrollee charges less 
for the comparable health care service than the average price paid by that carrier.

5. Out-of-network provider. If an enrollee elects to receive a comparable health 
2 care service from an out-of-network provider that results or would otherwise result in a 
3 shared savings incentive payment, the carrier shall apply the amount paid for the 
4 comparable health care service toward the enrollee's cost sharing as specified in the 
5 enrollee's health plan as if the health care services were provided by a network provider. 
6 6. No administrative expense. A shared savings incentive payment made by a 
7 carrier in accordance with this section is not an administrative expense of the carrier for 
8 rate development or rate filing pw:poses. 
9 7. Report. Beginning March 1, 2019 and annually on March 1st of each year 
10 thereafter, a carrier shall file with the superintendent for the most recent calendar year the 
11 total number of shared savings incentive payments made pursuant to this section, the use 
12 of comparable health care services by category of service for which shared savings 
13 incentive payments are made, the total shared savings incentive payments made to 
14 enrollees, the average amount of shared savings incentive payments made by category of 
15 service, the total savings achieved below the average prices by category of service and 
16 the total number and percentage of a carrier's enrollees that participated. Beginning April 
17 1, 2019 and annually by April 1st of each year thereafter, the superintendent shall submit 
18 an aggregate report for all carriers containing the information required by this subsection 
19 to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health 
20 insurance matters. 
21 8. Rules. The superintendent may adopt rules as necessary to implement this 
22 section, including rules establishing criteria for a waiver under subsection 2. Rules 
23 adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
24 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.' 
25 SUMMARY 
26 This amendment is the minority report of the committee. The amendment replaces the 
27 bill and changes the title. 
28 The amendment requires all carriers offering health plans in the State, beginning 
29 January 1, 2018, to provide a shared savings incentive program as a component of all 
30 health plans, except health plans offered through the federally facilitated marketplace 
31 established pursuant to the federal Affordable Care Act, unless a waiver has been granted 
32 by the superintendent. The amendment establishes the shared savings incentive program 
33 for enrollees who elect to receive a comparable health care service that costs less than the 
34 average price paid for that service by a carrier. The amendment defines "comparable 
35 health care service" as a service for which a carrier offers a shared savings incentive 
36 payment and includes, at a minimum, a health care service in the following 4 categories: 
37 physical and occupational therapy services, obstetrical and gynecological services, 
38 radiology and imaging services and laboratory services. If an enrollee shops for services, 
39 the amendment requires a carrier to pay that enrollee a shared savings incentive payment 
40 of at least 40% of the difference between the average amount for that comparable health 
41 care service and the amount paid, except that a payment is not required if the saved cost is 
42 $50 or less.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT"~" to S.P. 470, L.D. 1305 
1 The amendment authorizes a carrier to establish its own methodology for calculating 
2 the average price paid by that carrier under its shared savings incentive program and to 
3 make health care services received from an out-of-network provider not eligible for a 
4 shared savings incentive payment. If an enrollee elects to receive health care services 
5 from an out-of-network provider that would otherwise be eligible for a shared savings 
6 incentive payment, a carrier shall apply the amount paid for the comparable health care 
7 service toward the enrollee's cost sharing as specified in the enrollee's health plan as if the 
8 health care services were provided by a network provider. 
9 The amendment also requires carriers to provide certain information to the 
10 Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance on an annual 
11 basis relating to the payments made to enrollees, the use of health care services for which 
12 payments are provided and the saved costs if an enrollee elects to receive health care 
13 services from a provider that cost less than the average cost for a particular admission, 
14 procedure or service. The Bureau of Insurance is required to report aggregate information 
15 from all carriers to the Legislature on an annual basis.

Potential future biennium savings -All Funds 
This bill requires, beginning January 1, 2018, that all carriers offering a health plan in the State shall provide a shared 
savings program. Any savings would accrue to carriers, participants and eventually the State through lower premiums. 
The amount of savings will depend on the specific details of each shared savings plan and the participant response to 
the plan. No savings can be detennined at this time. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation from the provisions of this bill are 
expected to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
