Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.  Municipalities with 4,000 or fewer residents 3 
are not required to adopt or enforce the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code, but if 4 
such a municipality adopts or enforces a building code, it must be the Maine Uniform 5 
Building and Energy Code.  6 
This bill increases the minimum threshold after which a mu nicipality is required to 7 
enforce the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code to more than 5,000 residents.  8
