SUMMARY  13 
Current law allows a person to request a refund of the amount of sales tax paid on the 14 
purchase of electricity used in commercial agricultural produ ction.  Current law also 15 
provides an exemption from sales tax for 95% of the sale price of fuel and electricity 16 
purchased for use at a manufacturing facility.  17 
This bill, beginning January 1, 2016, extends the sales tax exemption for fuel to a 18 
greenhouse fa cility that occupies at least 1,000,000 square feet of indoor space that is 19 
operated by an agricultural employer that employs at least 100 employees and is engaged 20 
in the year -round commercial production of fruits or vegetables.  The ability of that 21 
agricu ltural employer to obtain a refund for sales tax paid on electricity used in 22 
commercial agriculture production is not affected by this bill.  23
