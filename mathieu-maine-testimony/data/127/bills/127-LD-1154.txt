SUMMARY  13 
This bill creates a statutory framework that allows a corporation to elect to become a 14 
benefit corpora tion by explicitly stating in its articles of incorporation a general benefit 15 
purpose or one or more specific benefit purposes, which are other than maximizing 16 
shareholder value.  "General public benefit" means a material positive impact on society 17 
and the  environment, taken as a whole, assessed against a 3rd -party standard, from the 18 
business and operations of the benefit corporation.  A specific public benefit can be 19 
providing goods and services to underserved individuals and communities, the promotion 20 
of economic opportunities, protecting the environment, improving human health or other 21 
particular benefits to society or the environment.  22 
A benefit corporation may be subject to a benefit enforcement proceeding for failing 23 
to pursue or create a general public  benefit or a specific public benefit as set forth in its 24 
articles of incorporation, or for a violation of any obligation, duty or standard of conduct 25 
imposed.  26 
A benefit corporation must make its annual benefit report available publicly and file 27 
it as an a nnual corporate report with the Secretary of State.  28
