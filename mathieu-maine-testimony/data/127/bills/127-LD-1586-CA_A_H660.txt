COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
~· d. cz,. COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1077, L.D. 1586 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
3 This amendment replaces the bill, which restricts which public bodies may conduct 
4 public proceedings when one or more members are participating remotely through 
5 telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means of communication. Instead, this 
6 amendment provides that any body subject to the Freedom of Access Act may conduct a 
7 public proceeding in which one or more members participate remotely through 
8 telephonic, video, electronic or other similar means of communication, but only if the 
9 body first adopts a written policy that governs the remote participation and that explicitly 
10 describes how the policy meets the principles of the Freedom of Access Act. The policy 
11 must address under what circumstances a member may participate remotely, whether the 
12 body may conduct an executive session when a member is participating remotely, 
13 whether a quorum must physically assemble, the proceedings in which a member 
14 participating remotely may vote and how the body will ensure that members of the public 
15 in attendance at the site of the proceeding included in the notice can hear or see and hear 
16 the members who are participating remotely. 
17 A body that adopts a remote participation policy must make the policy available on 
18 the body's publicly accessible website and must post a copy at the location of each 
19 meeting during which one or more members participate remotely. 
20 A body that adopts a remote participation policy must send a copy of the policy to the 
21 Public Access Ombudsman, who will make all the policies received available to the 
22 public and submit them annually to the Right To Know Advisory Committee.
