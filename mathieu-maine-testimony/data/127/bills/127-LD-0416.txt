 SUMMARY  1 
The purpose of this bill is to eliminate duplicative appeals from the juvenile court.  2 
Under current law, all appeals from adjudications in juvenile court go first to the Superior 3 
Court, with a second appeal availabl e at the Supreme Judicial Court. This bill provides 4 
instead that appeals are brought directly to the Supreme Judicial Court.  5
