FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,A" to H.P. 265, L.D. 399, Bill, "An Act To 
Designate a Youth Bear Hunting Day" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Establish a Youth Bear Hunting Day' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and before the summary and 
inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the long-term health of Maine's hunting tradition is dependent on the 
recruitment of young hunters, the number of which has been on the decline; and 
Whereas, providing positive hunting opportunities for young hunters is essential to 
ensuring their long-term participation in the sport; and 
Whereas, allowing youth to hunt bear on a day before other bear hunters are in the 
field will provide a positive hunting experience; and 
Whereas, as August 31, 2015 is the opening day for hunting bear with a firearm, 
this Act must take effect before that date to establish a youth bear hunting day this year; 
and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows: 
Sec. 1. 12 MRSA §11251, sub-§2 is enacted to read: 
2. Youth bear hunting day. There is a youth hunting day for hunting bear without a
