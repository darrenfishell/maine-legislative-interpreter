43 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 436, L.D. 1231 
Sec. 25. Replacement of equipment; road openings. Upon the reconstruction 
of any public roadway by the Town of Southwest Harbor, the district shall coordinate the 
replacement of any sewer or water lines, equipment, valves or hydrants that have reached 
their maximum useful life. A rebuilt or resurfaced road may not be opened or excavated 
by the district except under emergency conditions, within 5 years of reconstruction or 
repavement of the road. 
Sec. 26. Referendum; effective date. This Act takes effect when approved only 
for the purpose of permitting its submission to the legal voters within the Town of 
Southwest Harbor at a referendum called for that purpose and held within 2 years of the 
effective date of this Act. The election must be called by the Board of Selectmen of the 
Town of Southwest Harbor and must be held at the regular voting place. The referendum 
must be called, advertised and conducted according to the law relating to municipal 
elections. The registrars shall rhake a complete list of all the eligible voters of the 
proposed district as described in this Act. The list prepared by the registrars governs the 
eligibility of a voter. For the purpose of registration of voters, the registrars of voters 
must be in session the regular workday preceding the referendum. The subject matter of 
this Act is reduced to the following question: 
"Do you favor merging the Southwest Harbor water department and the 
Southwest Harbor sewer department to create the Southwest Harbor 
Water and Sewer District and transferring all municipal water and sewer 
assets to the Southwest Harbor Water and Sewer District?" 
The voters shall indicate by a cross or check mark placed against the word "Yes" or 
"No" their opinion of the same. 
The results must be declared by the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Southwest 
Harbor and due certificate of the results filed by the clerk with the Secretary of State. 
This Act takes effect for all other purposes immediately upon its approval by a 
majority of the legal voters of the Town of Southwest Harbor voting at the election. 
Failure to achieve the necessary approval in any referendum does not prohibit subsequent 
referenda consistent with this section as long as the referenda are held within 2 years after 
the effective date of this Act.'

Board of Selectmen of the Town of Southwest Harbor to appoint a resident of the Town 
of Southwest Harbor as a trustee until the town manager position is filled. This 
amendment also requires the board of selectmen to determine the terms of the 2 appointed 
trustees, for the first board only. This amendment requires that notice be filed with the
