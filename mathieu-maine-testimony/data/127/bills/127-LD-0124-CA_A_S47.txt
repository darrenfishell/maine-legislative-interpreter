15 2. Credentialing. The credentialling credentialing of providers by a carrier is 
16 governed by this subsection. 
17 A. The granting of credentials must be based on objective standards that are 
18 available to providers upon application for credentialling credentialing. A carrier 
19 shall consult with appropriately qualified health care professionals in developing its 
20 credentialling credentialing standards. 
21 B. All credentialling credentialing decisions, including those granting, denying or 
22 withdrawing credentials, must be in writing. The provider must be provided with all 
23 reasons for the denial of an application for credentialling credentialing or the 
24 withdrawal of credentials. A withdrawal of credentials must be treated as a provider 
25 termination and is subject to the requirements of subsection 3-A. 
26 C. A carrier shall establish and maintain an appeal procedure, including the 
27 provider's right to a hearing, for dealing with provider concerns n~lating to the denial 
28 of credentialling credentialing for not meeting the objective credentialling 
29 credentialing standards of the plan and the contractual relationship between the 
30 carrier and the provider. The superintendent shall determine whether the process 
31 provided by a carrier is fair and reasonable. This procedure must be specified in 
32 every contract between a carrier and a provider or between a calTier and a provider 
33 network if a carrier does not contract with providers individually.

1 or denying credentials may be extended upon written notification from the carrier 
2 within 60 days following submission of a completed application stating that 
3 information contained in the application requires additional time for verification. All 
4 credentialling credentialing decisions must be made within 180 days of receipt of a 
5 completed application. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application is 
6 completed if the application includes all of the information required by the uniform 
7 oredentialling credentialing application used by carriers and providers in this State, 
8 such attachments to that application as required by the carrier at the time of 
9 application and all corrections required by the carrier. A carrier shall review the 
10 entire application before returning it to the provider for corrections with a 
11 comprehensive list of all corrections needed at the time the application is first 
12 returned to the provider. A carrier may not require that a provider have a home 
13 address within the State before accepting an application. 
14 Sec. 2. 24-A MRSA §4303, sub-§2-A is enacted to read:

16 credentialing. A carrier offering or renewing a health plan in the State shall pay claims 
17 for services rendered to an enrollee by a provider prior to credentials being granted from

19 credentials are granted to that provider by the carrier in accordance with the requirements 
20 of subsection 2. A provider intending to submit a claim pursuant to this subsection may 
21 not submit the claim until the provider has been notified by the carrier whether the 
22 provider has been credentialed and of the effective date of any credentials. If a claim is 
23 submitted prior to the date credentials are granted, the carrier may process that claim in 
24 the same manner as a claim submitted by a provider that has not been credentialed. I 
25 SUMMARY 
26 This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment requires carriers to pay providers 
27 for services rendered prior to credentials being granted, retroactive to when a complete 
28 application for credentialing is submitted, as long as credentials are granted to that 
29 provider by the carrier. The bill required retroactive payment to a provider for services 
30 rendered up to 60 days prior to credentials being granted. The amendment clarifies that a 
31 claim may not be submitted until the provider has been notified of the credentialing 
32 decision and the effective date of any credentials. 
33 The amendment makes a spelling change to match the preferred spelling of the 
34 relevant national accrediting organization.
