 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to revisit the motor vehicle classification of autocycle, which was 5 
defined in the Maine Revised  Statutes, Title 29 -A, section 101, former subsection 6 -B as 6 
an enclosed motorcycle with up to 3 wheels. The definition was a temporary measure that 7 
self-repealed in 2013.  This bill proposes reviewing various types and models of enclosed 8 
motor vehicles wi th 3 wheels or fewer that are existing or under development for the 9 
purpose of registration and possibly creating a new motor vehicle classification for 10 
registration under the State's motor vehicle laws.  11
