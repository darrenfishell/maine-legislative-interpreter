17 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to S.P. 349, L.D. 1009 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. Like the bill, this amendment authorizes the Board 
of Dental Examiners to issue a permit to a bona fide denturlst student of a school 
acceptable to the board, after the completion of satisfactory training, to perform limited 
denturist services in private practice or institutional and public health service programs 
within the State, commensurate with the student's level of training under the supervision 
and control of a licensed dentist or denturlst or instructional facility acceptable to the 
board. The amendment differs from the bill in that it requires the board only, rather than 
the board and the school, prior to the issuance of this permit, to determine that the 
supervision and control of the services to be performed by the student are adequate and 
that the performance of those services by the student adds to the student's knowledge and 
skill in the practice of denturism. The amendment specifies that a permit issued is valid 
for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed one time only for the purpose 
of completing supervised training experience. It also requires the board to adopt routine 
technical rules to implement this provision.
