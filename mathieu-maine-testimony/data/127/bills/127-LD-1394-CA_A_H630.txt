expend and disburse state funds to provide grants to school administrative units for the 
establishment of summer schools and for the establishment of collaborative time for 
professional development through the authorization of miscellaneous costs under Title

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This legislation requires the Education Research Institute (ERI), along with the Department of Education, to conduct 
further research and analysis of extended school day programs and the availability of federal grant funds under Title I 
and other funding for educational equity for economically disadvantaged students. 
The Department of Education's General Purpose Aid for Local Schools program already has funding of $250,000 in 
both fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 to support the work of the ERI, which was established in Public Law 1995, c. 
395, Part J to collect and analyze education information and perform targeted education research for the Legislature. 
This fiscal note assumes that funding for the ERI in fiscal year 2016-17 included in the biennial budget will be 
sufficient to support the cost of the two research projects in this bill and that both will be included in the 2016-2017 
workplan approved by the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs and, therefore, no General 
Fund appropriation is required. If the projects are not included in the 2016-2017 workplan and no General Fund 
appropriations are made to support the costs of the research projects, the ERI may not be able to conduct the required 
research and analysis. 
This legislation allows, but does not require, the Commissioner of Education to provide grants and "expend and 
disburse funds" for summer school programs, collaborative time for professional development, economically 
disadvantaged students and professional development for school and school administrative unit leaders. Since no 
funding is included in the bill and the language is permissive, there is no fiscal impact associated with these parts of 
the bill other than the cost of rulemaking, which can be absorbed within the department's existing budgeted resources. 
Additional costs to the Department of Education to collaborate with the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
having jurisdiction over education and cultural affairs during the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature to 
develop best practice guidelines for collaborative time for professional development can be absorbed within existing 
budgeted resources.
