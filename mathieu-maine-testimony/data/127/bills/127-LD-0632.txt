sum payment prior or subsequent to applying for assistance, that payment must be 18

remainder of the lump sum payment by the verified actual monthly amounts for all of the 31 
household's basic necessities.  Tha t dividend represents the period of proration 32 
determined by the administrator to commence on the date of receipt of the lump sum 33

other than required state mandate funds pursuant to section 5685 that do not displace 30 
current property tax expenditures, the municipality shall lower its property tax levy limit 31 
in that year in an amount equal to the net new funds.  F or purposes of this subsection, 32 
"net new funds" means the amount of funds received by the municipality from the State 33 
during the most recently completed calendar year, with respect to services funded in 34 
whole or in part by the property tax levy, less the p roduct of the following:  the amount of 35 
such funds received in the prior calendar year multiplied by one plus the growth 36 
limitation factor described in subsection 3.  "Net new funds" refers to state -municipal 37 
revenue sharing and does not include changes in state funding for general assistance 38

 Page 22 - 127LR0757(01) -1

municipality received or wi ll receive a net reduction in funding, the municipality is 3 
authorized to adjust its property tax levy limit in an amount equal to the net reduction of 4 
funds.  For the purpose of determining if there was or will be a net reduction in funding, 5 
the municipali ty may consider only those funds that are net new funds.  For purposes of 6 
this subsection, with respect to the development of any municipal budget that was finally 7 
adopted on or before July 1, 2013, "net reduction in funding" means the amount of funds 8 
received by the municipality from the State during the calendar year immediately 9 
preceding the most recently completed calendar year less the amount of such funds 10 
received in the most recently completed calendar year.  For the purposes of this 11 
subsection, with  respect to the development of a municipal budget that is finally adopted 12 
after July 1, 2013, a municipality may calculate net reduction in funding as the amount of 13 
funds received by the municipality from the State during the municipal fiscal year 14 
immediat ely preceding the fiscal year for which the budget is being developed less the 15 
amount of such funds that will be received during the fiscal year for which the budget is 16 
being prepared, as reasonably calculated on the basis of all available information.  If  the 17 
calculation required by this subsection yields a positive value, that value may be added to 18 
the municipality's property tax levy limit. If a municipality receives net new funds in any 19 
fiscal year for which its property tax levy limit has not been adju sted as provided in this 20 
subsection, the municipality shall adjust its property tax levy limit in the following year 21 
in an amount equal to the net new funds.  22
