 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to modernize current state road user fee funding mechanisms to 5 
promote equity and sustainability  and to yield the predictable funding levels needed to 6 
support a safe and reliable highway and bridge system that supports economic 7 
opportunity.  8 
In order to attain these goals, the bill proposes to require some or all of the following:  9 
1.  A review and rev ision, if necessary, of the funding levels, including any 10 
anticipated shortfalls, necessary to achieve the highway and bridge capital goals 11 
enumerated in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 73, subsection 7, paragraphs 12 
A to D;  13 
2.  A mechanism to address the erosion of Highway Fund receipts that is caused in 14 
part by higher automobile fuel efficiency such as registration fee surcharges on electric or 15 
hybrid cars or the establishment of a voluntary vehicle miles traveled program that allows 16 
a user to  self-report the miles traveled and pay a tax based on those miles;  17 
3.  A method of placing a more equitable share of the costs of the highway system on 18 
nonresidents such as reducing baseline fuel tax rates and adding a seasonal gasoline tax 19 
surcharge or i mposing seasonal electronic tolling;  20 
4.  Reducing baseline fuel tax rates and adding a wholesale tax component;  21 
5.  Fuel tax surcharges that are tied to fuel prices or federal fuel taxes and that would 22 
be reduced or eliminated as fuel prices or the federal  tax increases; and  23 
6.  The dedication of a portion of sales tax receipts from sales of transportation - 24 
related products, such as vehicles and tires, for transportation needs.  25
