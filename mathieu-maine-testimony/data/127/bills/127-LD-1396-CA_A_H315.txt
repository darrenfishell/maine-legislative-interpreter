Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The cost to the Department of Education to implement the requirements ofthis legislation can not be determined at 
this time but is expected to be significant. 
This bill requires the Department of Education to: 
1) Stop the adoption and implementation of the common core standards as the State's content standards for English 
language arts and mathematics and void any prior actions taken to adopt or implement the common core state 
standards. 
2) Furnish SAD's with assessments for elementary and secondary schools that were implemented during the 2013-
2014 school year in time to be used during the 2015-2016 school year. 
3) Replace current standards in English language arts and mathematics with new standards that are consistent with the 
standards in effect in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 2009 and adopt or develop assessments that are aligned 
with the content standards to be used in the 2016-2017, 2017-18 and 2018-2019 school years. 
4) Adopt new content standards in English language arts, mathematics, science and social studies that are distinct and 
independent from standards previously adopted by the department so that they are in place for the 2019-2020 school 
year. 
5) Adopt or develop assessments for elementary and secondary schools in English language arts and mathematics that 
are aligned with the new content standards for use beginning in the 2019-2020 school year. 
6) Provide administrative support to 4 committees established to review and approve the new content standards and 
assessments adopted or developed by the department in English language arts, mathematics, science and social 
studies. 
LR1487(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of2 
The requirements and fiscal impact of this legislation on local school administrative units is less clear. This 
legislation does not require SAD's to use all or any part of the content standards developed or adopted by the 
department. However, this bill voids the State's content standards for English language arts and mathematics that 
were formulated to align with the common core state standards as well as any assessment related to the Smarter 
Balanced Assessment Consortium or Partnership for Assessment of Readiness. for College and Careers. Therefore, 
the SAD's will need to make some adjustments to their current content standards and assessments, whether they 
choose to adopt the content standards and assessments that will be developed by the department or to adopt their own 
set of standards and assessments.
