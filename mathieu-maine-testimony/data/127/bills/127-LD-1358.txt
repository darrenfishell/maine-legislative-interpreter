 Page 11 - 127LR0269(01) -1 
 A.  An official at a state university or college campus may not use that official's 1 
position for private benefit or inurement, and a r elative of the official or any entity 2 
with which the official has an interest may not use that official's position for private 3 
benefit or inurement;  4

employee of a vendor of g oods or services to the state university or college campus or 6 
who has a business interest in that vendor or whose relative has a business interest in 7 
that vendor may not vote on or participate in the administration by the state university 8 
or college campus  of any transaction with that vendor; and  9 
C.  Upon becoming aware of an actual or potential conflict of interest, an official 10 
shall advise the president or chief executive officer of the state university or college 11 
campus of the conflict of interest.  Each  state university or college campus must 12 
maintain a written record of all disclosures of actual or potential conflicts of interest 13 
made pursuant to this paragraph and must report the disclosures by January 31st of 14 
each year to the auditor for that campus.  The auditor shall forward the conflict of 15

sponsoring state university or college campus, finally determines that a business 28 
participating in the program has acted fraudulently in connection with its participation in 29 
the program, that business must be immediately terminated from the program.  The 30 
execution by a business of an application containing false statements constitutes unsworn 31 
falsifi cation under Title 17 -A, section 453.  In addition, the business must be required to 32 
add back to its taxes the total value of the tax benefits described in section 13120 -Y that 33
