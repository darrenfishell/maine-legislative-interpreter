The required local activities in this bill may represent a State mandate pursuant to the Constitution of Maine. Unless 
General Fund appropriations are provided to fund at least 90% of the additional costs or a Mandate Preamble is 
amended to the bill and two-thirds of the members of each House vote to exempt this mandate from the funding 
requirement, municipalities may not be required to implement these changes. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Dedicating 50% of the sales tax revenue collected from consumer fireworks sales to the Maine Length of Service 
Award Program requires transfers from the General Fund of $109,250 in both fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17 and 
transfers from Municipal Revenue Sharing of $5,750 in both fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17. The transfers will 
provide $115,000 in both fiscal years to the Maine Length of Service Award Program. The bill includes Other Special 
Revenue Funds allocations of $115,000 in both years.
