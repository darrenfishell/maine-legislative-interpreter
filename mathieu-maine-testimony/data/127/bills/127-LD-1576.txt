resides setting forth the student's circumstances giving rise to the request.  20 
A.  If the commissioner makes a designation under this subsection, the school 21 
administ rative unit where the student resides shall pay tuition for that student to the 22 
receiving school administrative unit as calculated in accordance with this subsection 23 
and chapter 219.  24 
B.  If a student subject to a designation under this subsection is receiv ing special 25

 SUMMARY  1 
This bill provides that if a superintendent's decision regarding the transfer of a student 2 
receiving special education services to a school out of the s tudent's school administrative 3 
unit is appealed to the Commissioner of Education or the State Board of Education and 4 
the commissioner or state board approves the transfer of the student, the state subsidy of 5 
special education costs for the transferred stud ent may not be reduced as a result of the 6 
transfer.  7 
This bill gives the Commissioner of Education the authority to designate a school 8 
administrative unit to enroll a student when the student's school administrative unit 9 
neither maintains a school nor contr acts with another school administrative unit and no 10 
school administrative unit enrolls the student voluntarily.  For a student receiving special 11 
education services, the bill requires a resident school administrative unit to pay to the 12 
receiving school admi nistrative unit tuition, special education tuition, other costs directly 13 
related to the student's special education and costs associated with due process 14 
proceedings for providing a free, appropriate public education.  15 
This bill allows the Commissioner of E ducation to designate the school 16 
administrative unit that is responsible for oversight of the individualized education 17 
program of a child with a disability who is a state ward and is placed in an out -of-state 18 
residential treatment center by the Department of Health and Human Services.  19 
This bill authorizes the Commissioner of Education to provide additional funds to a 20 
school administrative unit based on a budgetary hardship resulting from a special 21 
education placement.  22 
This bill makes the following changes t o the laws relating to public charter schools.  23 
1.  The bill allows charter schools authorized by a local school board or a 24 
collaborative among local school boards to give enrollment preference to residents of the 25 
school administrative unit or units whose s chool board or school boards authorized the 26 
charter school.  27 
2.  The bill extends the submission deadline for a charter school authorizer's annual 28 
report to the Commissioner of Education from 60 to 90 days after the end of the school 29 
fiscal year and adds la nguage to address the disposition of graduation records and records 30 
of other students not transitioning to another Maine public school if a charter school 31 
closes.  32 
3.  The bill adds language to reflect that charter schools are subject to educator 33 
effectiven ess requirements.  34 
4.  The bill provides that the compulsory attendance laws apply to virtual charter 35 
schools.  36 
5.  For a charter school in a school administrative unit with an enrollment of 500 or 37 
fewer students, current law caps the number of students from  the school administrative 38 
unit that the charter school may enroll during its first 3 years of operation at 5% of the 39 
school administrative unit's noncharter public school students per grade level.  The bill 40 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR2591(01) -1 
 provides that if 5% of the school administrative  unit's noncharter public school students 1 
per grade level is less than one, the charter school may enroll one student from the school 2 
administrative unit per grade level in each of the charter school's first 3 years of 3 
operation.  4
