SUMMARY  12 
Currently the State Government and Federal Government may issue special 13 
certificates permitting an employer to pay an individual with a physical or mental 14 
disability a wage less than the State's minimum wage based on t he individual's ability to 15 
perform the duties required for that employment in comparison to the ability of a person 16 
who does not have a physical or mental disability to perform the same duties.  This bill 17 
prohibits the issuance of such certificates.  Exist ing special certificates authorizing 18 
payment of less than the minimum wage remain in effect until the earlier of their 19 
expiration date and November 1, 2018.  After the expiration of a previously issued 20 
certificate, an individual who was covered by such cer tificate may apply to the Director 21 
of the Bureau of Labor Standards within the Department of Labor for a special work 22 
permit authorizing the payment of wages at less than the minimum wage rate by a certain 23 
employer.  24
