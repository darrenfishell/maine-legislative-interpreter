 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  36 MRSA ยง841, sub -ยง2-A is enacted to read:  2 
2-A.  Destruction of property.  The assessors, either upon written application or on 3 
their own initiative, may make such reasonable abatement,  but no more than 10% of the 4 
overlay, as they consider proper to reflect the diminishment of the value of a person's 5 
homestead due to its destruction after April 1st of the property tax year for which 6 
abatement is requested.  The total abatement granted by  the assessors pursuant to this 7 
subsection in any one property tax year may not exceed 50% of the overlay for that 8 
municipality for that property tax year.  Except for abatement requests relating to 9 
destruction that occurs after March 31, 2013 and before A pril 1, 2015, a taxpayer seeking 10 
an abatement pursuant to this subsection must file a written application requesting 11 
abatement within 18 months from the date of the destruction of the property stating the 12 
grounds for abatement.  13 
As used in this subsection, the following terms have the following meanings.  14 
A.  "Destruction" means damage to real property from fire, explosion or natural 15 
disaster that reduces the just value of the improvements on the property by at least 16 
50%.  17 
B.  "Homestead" has the same meaning as in section 681, subsection 2.  18 
C.  "Overlay" means the amount the assessors or, in primary assessing areas, the 19 
municipal officers assess on estates above the sum necessary for them to assess, as 20 
limited pursuant to section 710.  21 
Sec. 2.  Application; ret roactivity.  This Act applies retroactively to property tax 22 
years beginning on or after April 1, 2013.  23 
SUMMARY  24 
This bill allows municipal assessors, or the State Tax Assessor for property in the 25 
unorganized territory, to abate the property taxes of residen tial real property that, due to 26 
destruction by fire, explosion or natural disaster, suffers at least a 50% decrease in just 27 
value to improvements on that residential real property.  The abatement is limited to 28 
property that qualifies as a homestead under t he Maine resident homestead property tax 29 
exemption.  For an individual homestead, the amount of the abatement is limited to 10% 30 
of the overlay for the property tax year in which the abatement is sought.  If more than 31 
one homestead requests an abatement in a single property tax year, the aggregate amount 32 
of the abatements is limited to 50% of the overlay for the property tax year in which the 33 
multiple abatements are sought.  34
