 SUMMARY  1 
This bill amends the civil penalties for issuing a check that is subsequently 2 
dishonore d.  Current law allows a person to recover the amount of the check, the court 3 
costs and the processing charges incurred by the holder, plus interest at the rate of 12% 4 
per annum from the date of dishonor.  If the person liable does not pay the amount of th e 5 
check, plus costs and interest, before the hearing, the court may award reasonable 6 
attorney's fees to the prevailing party plus a civil penalty, not to exceed $150.  A person 7 
who issues a 2nd dishonored check to the same payee is liable for damages of th e lesser 8 
of 2 times the amount of the check and $750 if the person does not have an account at the 9 
bank from which the check is issued or $400 if there are insufficient funds to pay the 10 
check.  11 
This bill increases the civil penalty for issuing a check that is dishonored to twice the 12 
face amount of the check or $500, whichever is less.  This bill also imposes a service 13 
charge of $30 or 5% of the face amount of the check, whichever is greater, and removes 14 
the interest penalty.  The penalty for issuing a 2nd di shonored check to the same payee is 15 
increased to the lesser of 3 times the face value of the check and $1,000 if the person does 16 
not have an account at the bank from which the check is issued or $750 if there are 17 
insufficient funds to pay the check.  18
