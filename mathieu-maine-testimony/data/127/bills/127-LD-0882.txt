SUMMARY  22 
This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to consider additional requirements 23 
before approving a reorganization involving a telephone utility with gross annual state 24 
revenues greater than $50,000,000. The commission may approve the reorganization only 25 
when it is satisfied that the proposal will advance the economic development and 26 
information access goals of the State; that the  reorganization does not result in changes to 27 
the location and the accessibility of the telephone utility's management and to 28 
employment levels in a manner that would adversely affect safety, reliability or quality of 29 
service; and that the reorganization p rovides an affirmative benefit to the public. The bill 30 
also removes the requirement that the Public Utilities Commission rule upon a request for 31 
the reorganization of a large telephone utility within 180 days.  32
