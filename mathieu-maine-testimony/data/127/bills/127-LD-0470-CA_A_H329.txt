FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 309, L.D. 470, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
Children's Residential Care Facilities To Ensure the Safety of Their Residents" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง8108 is enacted to read: 
ยง8108. Search of property 
An administrator or other staff designated by an administrator of a children's home or 
children's residential care facility may search a resident's backpack or travel bag upon the 
resident's return to the home or facility if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that 
the backpack or travel bag contains misappropriated articles or items that would endanger 
the health or safety of the resident or other residents. A search of a resident's backpack or 
travel bag conducted under this section must be reasonably related to the objectives of the 
search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the resident and the 
nature of the suspected misappropriated or harmful items. Following a search of a 
resident's backpack or travel bag authorized under this section. the administrator or 
designated staff may confiscate any items found in the resident's possession that are 
misappropriated or that pose a health or safety risk to the resident or other residents.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. The amendment clarifies the provisions of the bill 
to allow an administrator or other designated staff of a children's home or children's 
residential care facility to search a resident's backpack or travel bag if there are 
reasonable grounds for suspecting that the backpack or travel bag contains 
misappropriated articles or items that would endanger the health or safety of the resident 
or other residents. The amended language better mirrors current Department of Health 
and Human Services rules and United States Supreme Court precedent.
