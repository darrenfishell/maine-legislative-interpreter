SUMMARY  12 
This bill is submitted by the Joint Standing Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs 13 
pursuant to Resolve 2015, chapter 19.  The bill implements the recommendations of a 14 
subcommittee established to streamline the criteria for the delivery and administration of 15 
state-established services and benefits to veterans and military service members in the 16 
State.  The bill repeals the definition of "wartime veteran" with regard to small business 17 
loans administered by the Finance Authority of Maine.  It provides an alte rnative to 18 
license plates as a method of showing eligibility for free day -use admission to state parks 19 
by disabled veterans by directing the Secretary of State to provide for a sticker to be 20 
placed on the veteran's driver's license or state identification card.  The bill also provides 21 
that a person with a veterans registration plate that is also a vanity plate is not required to 22 
pay the annual service fee for the vanity plate after an initial $25 fee is paid.  The bill 23 
clarifies references to veterans and m ilitary service members in the law governing the 24 
application of veteran preferences for rental housing administered through the Maine 25 
State Housing Authority.  Finally, the bill codifies in statute a provision currently in rule 26 
that requires the Adjutant G eneral to issue an annual report on the expenditures made 27 
from the Maine Military Family Relief Fund.  28
