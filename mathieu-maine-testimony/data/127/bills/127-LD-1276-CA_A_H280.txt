Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -Federal Expenditures Fund 
This legislation requires the Department of Education to terminate the use of the Smarter Balanced assessment and to 
adopt a method of education assessment for the 2015-2016 school year and each school year thereafter that complies 
with federal law but does not collect or disseminate personal data and attributes of students. The Department of 
Education has indicated that it will utilize existing federal funds to support the cost of this requirement and that the 
Federal Expenditures Fund allocations included as part of LD 1019, the Governor's proposed 2016-2017 biennial 
budget, if approved, will be sufficient to cover the expenditures. Therefore, no additional allocations are needed. 
This fiscal note may need to be adjusted depending on the final actions of the Legislature on the 2016-2017 biennial 
budget.
