 community -based renewable  energy project is proposed to be located, except that any 1 
project that is proposed to be located wholly in an unorganized or deorganized area of 2 
the State or that has a generating capacity of less than 100 kilowatts is exempt from 3 
the requirement set forth in this paragraph;  4 
B.  In the case of a community -based renewable  an energy project proposed to be 5

 Page 4 - 127LR1719(01) -1 
 shall conduct a competitive bidding process to select community -based renewable  energy 1 
projects to become program participants and enter long -term contracts under this section.  2 
The total installed capacity of community -based renewable energy projects selected in 3 
each competitive bid process must be as close as possible to but may no t exceed 15 4 
megawatts.  The commission shall select the lowest cost bids, based 50% on the proposed 5 
contract price and 50% on resulting ratepayer costs.  After a community -based renewable 6 
energy project is selected to be a program participant, the project must become 7 
operational and commence generating electricity within 3 years or the project's 8 
participation in the program is terminated, except that the commission may, on petition, 9 
grant an extension of up to 6 months if project completion was delayed due to factors 10 
beyond the control of the program participant.  11 
1.  Transmission and distribution utilities; required participation.  12 
Notwithstanding section 3204, the commission may shall  direct investor -owned  13 
transmission and distribution utilities to enter in to long -term contracts with program 14 
participants located within the service territory of the utility for energy, capacity 15 
resources or renewable energy credits. The commission may direct investor -owned  16 
transmission and distribution utilities to enter into contracts under this subsection only as 17 
agents for their customers and only in accordance with this section. An investor -owned  A 18 
transmission and distribution utility shall sell energy, capacity resources or renewable 19 
energy credits purchased pursuant to t his subsection into the wholesale electricity market 20 
or take other action relative to such energy, capacity resources or renewable energy 21 
credits as directed by the commission.  22 
2.  Consumer -owned transmission and distribution utilities; voluntary 23 
participa tion.  A consumer -owned transmission and distribution utility may, at the 24 
option of the utility, enter into long -term contracts with program participants located 25 
within the service territory of the utility for energy, capacity resources or renewable 26 
energy  credits.  Consumer -owned transmission and distribution utilities may enter into 27 
contracts under this subsection only as agents for their customers and only in accordance 28 
with this section.  29 
3.  Sale of energy; contract procedures. Energy, capacity resource s or renewable 30 
energy credits contracted in long -term contracts pursuant to this section may be sold into 31 
the wholesale electricity market in conjunction with solicitations for standard -offer 32 
supply bids under section 3212 or solicitations for green power offer bids under section 33 
3212 -A.  To the greatest extent possible, the commission shall develop procedures for 34 
long-term contracts for transmission and distribution utilities under this section having 35 
the same legal and financial effect as the procedures u sed for standard -offer service 36 
pursuant to section 3212 for transmission and distribution utilities.  37 
4.  Contract term.  A contract entered into pursuant to this section may not be for 38 
more than 20 years.  39 
5.  Contract pricing; cost containment.  The commis sion shall ensure that in any 40

10¢; and  43 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1719(01) -1 
 B.  The cost of the contract does not exceed the cost of the project plus a reasonable 1 
rate of return on investment as determined by the commission.  2 
6.  Contract negotiation.  For program participants with a generating capacity of one 3 
megawatt or more, the commission shall, in accordance with this subsection, conduct 4 
competitive solicitation s for long -term contracts.  The commission shall require that bids 5 
include full project cost disclosure. Following a review of bids received, the commission 6 
may negotiate with one or more potential suppliers.   The commission shall negotiate 7 
contracts that are commercially reasonable and that commit all parties to commercially 8 
reasonable behavior. In selecting program participants for contracting pursuant to this 9 
subsection, the commission shall select program participants that are competitive and the 10 
lowest  priced when compared to other available bids of the same or similar contract 11 
duration or terms.  12 
7.  Contract administration; small generators. For program participants with a 13 
generating capacity of less than one megawatt, the commission shall administer l ong-term 14 
contracts at prices established by the commission by rule.  The commission shall, at a 15 
minimum, establish prices for energy generated by the following renewable resources:  16 
A.  Wind power installations;  17 
B.  Solar arrays and installations; and  18 
C.  A ny other renewable resource upon request of one or more community -based 19 
renewable energy generators that use that resource.  20 
The commission shall establish prices under this subsection based on an analysis of 21 
reasonable costs and may establish different pri ces for different resources or technologies 22 
and different prices by time of generation in accordance with that analysis.  23 
8.  Cost and benefit allocation.  The commission shall ensure that all costs and 24 
benefits associated with contracts involving investor -owned  transmission and distribution 25 
utilities entered into under this section are allocated to electricity consumers in 26 
accordance with section 3210 -F. 27 
9.  Contract payments.  Contracts for capacity and related energy entered into 28 
pursuant to this section must provide that payments will be made only after contracted 29 
amounts of energy have been provided.  30 
10.  Ratepayer protection.  The commission shall ensure that mechanisms are 31 
established to provide protections for ratepayers over the term of contracts en tered into 32 
pursuant to this section.  33 
Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3605, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 329, Pt. A, §4, is repealed.  34

SUMMARY  36 
This bill makes various changes to the community -based renewable energy pilot 37 
program.  It makes the program permanent, broadens eligibility, adds provisions to ensure 38 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR1719(01) -1 
 program participant viability, eliminates the program incentive of renewable energy 1 
credit multipliers and requires the Public Utilities Commission to use a periodic 2 
competitive bidding process to choose projects that will receive long -term contracts.  3
