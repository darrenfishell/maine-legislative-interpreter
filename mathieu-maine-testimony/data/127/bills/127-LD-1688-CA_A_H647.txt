127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1153, L.D. 1688, Bill, "An Act To 
Amend the Laws Governing Funding of Maine Clean Election Act Candidates" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Amend the Laws Governing Funding of Maine Clean Election Act 
Gubernatorial Candidates' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 21-A MRSA §1125, sub-§5, ,rc-2 is enacted to read: 
C-2. As a candidate for Governor, collected all seed money contributions from 
registered voters in the State, exce_pt for an amount not to exceed $20,000, which may 
be collected from persons other than registered voters in the State;' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes from the bill the requirement that legislative candidates 
seeking certification under the Maine Clean Election Act may collect seed money 
contributions only from registered voters in the candidates' electoral divisions. The 
amendment retains the provision in the bill that requires a gubernatorial candidate seeking 
certification under the Maine Clean Election Act to collect seed money contributions 
from registered voters in the State, except that the amendment allows up to $20,000 in 
seed money contributions to be received from persons other than registered voters in the 
State.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill limits a candidate for Governor to collecting no more than $20,000 in seed money contributions from people 
that are not registered voters in Maine in order to be certified under the Maine Clean Election Act, resulting in 
potential future Other Special Revenue Funds savings to the Maine Clean Election Fund (MCEF) from fewer 
gubernatorial candidates participating in the Maine Clean Election Act. There is no current estimate on the amount of 
potential savings to the MCEF, although it will exceed any potential revenue loss.
