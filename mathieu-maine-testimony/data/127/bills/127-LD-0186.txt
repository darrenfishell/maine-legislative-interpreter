appropriate subsidy in this fund based on its percentage of statewide jail inmate days.  43

distribution for the purpose of community corrections as defined in subsection 1.  If a 11 
county fails to submit appropriate documentation verifying that the county expended 20% 12 
of its prior distribution for the purpose of community corrections, the department shall 13 
distribute to that county only 80% of its distribution.  The department shall  distribute the 14 
20% not distributed to that county to all other counties that submit appropriate 15 
documentation verifying compliance with the 20% expenditure requirement for the 16 
purpose of community corrections.  The department shall distribute these funds to those 17 
qualifying counties in an amount equal to each county's percent distribution pursuant to 18

SUMMARY  27 
Public Law 2007, chapter 653, the so -called jail consolidation law, enacted changes 28 
to the correctional laws, including creating a State Board of Corrections, for the purpose 29 
of developing and implementing a unified correctional system.  The public law 30 
established a cap on tax assessments for correctional services for each county based on  31 
the fiscal year 2007 -08 county tax assessment for correctional -related expenditures and 32 
prohibited the counties from collecting taxes from the municipalities for the purpose of 33 
retiring any correctional services debt issued after July 1, 2008.  34 
This bill r epeals the changes that were made by Public Law 2007, chapter 653, 35 
eliminating the State Board of Corrections and all of its duties, and returns the law to the 36 
form it was in prior to jail consolidation.  This bill requires that the State continue to 37
