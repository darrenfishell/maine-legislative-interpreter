Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Removing the emergency preamble will result in this legislation not becoming effective until October of 20 15. It is 
unclear how the Department of Education and school districts will incorporate the changes in this legislation in the 
middle of a school year. 
Removing the emergency preamble will reduce the state-municipal revenue sharing shown in the committee 
amendment by approximately $34,500 to Madison, $13,000 to Skowhegan and $13,600 to East Millinocket for the 
2015-16 fiscal year. This total decrease of $61,100 will mean all other municipalities will see revenue sharing 
amounts increase by $61,100 through the state-municipal revenue sharing fOIDmla compared to the changes in the 
committee amendment.
