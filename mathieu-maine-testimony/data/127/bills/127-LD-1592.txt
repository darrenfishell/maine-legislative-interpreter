SUMMARY  34 
This bill is reported out by the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation pursuant 35 
to Joint Order 2016, S.P. 628.  The intent of the bill is to address a recent United States  36 
Supreme Court decision, Reed v. Town of Gilbert, No. 13 -502 (2015) , relating to 37 
categorical signs within a public right -of-way.  The committee has not taken a position on 38 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR2682(01) -1 
 the substance of this bill and by reporting this bill out the committee is not sugge sting and 1 
does not intend to suggest that it agrees or disagrees with any aspect of this bill.  The 2 
committee is reporting the bill out for the sole purpose of turning the proposal into a 3 
printed bill that can be referred to the committee for an appropriat e public hearing and 4 
subsequent processing in the normal course.  The committee is taking this action to 5 
ensure clarity and transparency in the legislative review of the proposal.  6 
The bill makes the following changes to the Maine traveler information servi ces laws.  7 
1.   It clarifies the definition of "erect" to also mean display.  8 
2.  It adds a definition of "temporary sign" to mean a sign bearing a noncommercial 9 
message that has been placed within the public right -of-way for a limited period of time.  10 
3.  It  corrects a typographical error in the provision relating to types and 11 
arrangements of signs.  12 
4.  It removes the following signs from the provisions relating to categorical signs 13 
within the public right -of-way: signs showing the place and time of service o r meetings of 14 
religious and civic organizations; memorial signs or tablets; signs bearing political 15 
messages relating to an election, primary or referendum; signs erected by a producer that 16 
directs travelers to the location where farm and food products are  grown, produced and 17 
sold; and signs erected for a farmers' market that are directional in nature.  Instead, the 18 
bill creates a broader category of temporary signs within the public right -of-way in order 19 
to regulate signs within a public right -of-way in a content -neutral manner per the United 20 
States Supreme Court decision, Reed v. Town of Gilbert, No. 13 -502 (2015) .  It provides 21 
that a temporary sign may be placed within the public right -of-way for a maximum of 6 22 
weeks per calendar year during the time peri od from May 1st to November 15th.  It 23 
provides that a temporary sign may not be placed within the public right -of-way within 24 
200 feet of another temporary sign bearing the same or substantially the same message.  It 25 
also provides that a temporary sign may not exceed 4 feet by 8 feet in size.  Finally, it 26 
provides that a temporary sign must be labeled with the name and address of the 27 
individual, entity or organization that placed the sign within the public right -of-way and 28 
the designated time period the sign  will be maintained within the public right -of-way.  29 
5.  It repeals the provision of law regarding categorical signs outside the public right - 30 
of-way.  Instead, the bill provides that, except as provided by current law relating to on - 31 
premises signs, a sign m ay be erected outside the public right -of-way as long as it does 32 
not exceed 50 square feet in size.  33 
6.  It repeals the provision of law relating to unlawful removal of political signs.  34 
Instead, it provides that the unlawful removal of temporary signs from  the public right -of- 35 
way is a civil violation for which a fine of up to $250 may be adjudged.  36
