SUMMARY  29 
This bill amends the Maine Registry of Certified Nursing Assistants and Direct Care 30 
Workers in the following ways.  31 
1.  It clarifies the circu mstances under which a person employed as a direct care 32 
worker is listed on the registry.  33 
2.  It amends the requirements for listing certified nursing assistants and direct care 34 
workers.  35 
3.  It requires employers to verify that an individual listed on the registry is eligible 36 
for employment as a certified nursing assistant or direct care worker.  37 
4.  It consolidates information and aligns language used across programs based on 38 
federal and state laws related to background checks, disqualifying offenses, prohi bited 39 
 
 Page 16 - 127LR0555(01) -1 
 employment, criminal convictions and substantiated findings related to complaints of 1 
abuse, neglect or misappropriation of property.  2 
5.  It describes the process of identifying the disqualifying offenses that adversely 3 
affect an individual's eligibil ity for employment as a certified nursing assistant or direct 4 
care worker.  5 
6.  It establishes the department's authority to adopt eligibility for listing on the 6 
registry and other requirements by rule.  7 
7.  It establishes statutory background check requirem ents and employment 8 
restrictions based on disqualifying offenses, including criminal convictions.  9 
8.  It replaces current ambiguous statutory language that bases employment bans on 10 
the length of the sentence that may be imposed with a requirement that the department 11 
adopt by rule a table of named crimes that form the rational basis for employment bans 12 
based on convictions.  13 
9.  It requires the department to adopt rules that list nondisqualifying criminal 14 
convictions that do not ban employment leaving hiring decisions to employer discretion.  15 
10.  It provides that disqualifying criminal convictions result in 10 -year or 30 -year 16 
employment bans and that the length of an employment ban may be shortened by filing a 17 
petition with the department to lift an employment  ban prior to its expiration.  18 
11.  It consolidates complaint investigation requirements.  19
