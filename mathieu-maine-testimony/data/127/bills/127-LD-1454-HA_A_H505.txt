Whereas, when asked to ratify Land for Maine's Future bond issues, the majority of

32 HOUSE AMENDMENT'~ "to H.P. 996, L.D. 1454 
Whereas, in July of 2015, as many as 3 dozen Land for Maine's Future projects 
approved by the board in 2011 and 2014 remain in limbo, awaiting confirmation that the 
State will fulfill the multiple commitments it has made to landowners, communities, 
sportsmen, outdoor enthusiasts, anglers, farmers, local businesses and voters; and 
Whereas, in November of 20 15, the authorization to borrow $6,470,000 in Land for 
Maine's Future bonds ratified by the voters will expire if the funds are not borrowed; 
now, therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Authorization of board. Resolved: That the Governor shall authorize 
the Land for Maine's Future Board to conduct its business in accordance with its authority 
as outlined under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 353 regarding Land for 
Maine's Future bonds authorized by Maine voters in 2010 but not yet issued; and be it 
further 
Sec. 2. Borrowing. Resolved: That the Governor shall work with the Treasurer 
of State to issue the bonds ratified by Maine voters in 2010 before that authorization 
expires; and be it further 
Sec. 3. Final authorization of projects. Resolved: That the Land for Maine's 
Future Board, following its current due diligence protocols, shall grant final authorization 
for borrowing for any pending project for which the board has given initial approval 
when that project has met all the requirements outlined in the 2013 Land for Maine's 
Future Proposal Workbook and the recipients' award letters; and be it further 
Sec. 4. Approval by Governor. Resolved: That the Governor or the Governor's 
assignees shall sign all necessary financial orders, project agreements and other 
paperwork requested by the Land for Maine's Future Board necessary to implement the 
borrowing authorized by the board pursuant to section 3.'
