good faith efforts to serve the tenant, that service may be accomplished by both mailing 19 
the notice by first class mail to the tenant's last known address and by leaving the notice 20

through the date when a 30 -day notice would expire, the notice must expire on or after 22 
the date through which the rent has been paid.  Either party may waive in writing the 30 23 
days' notice at the time the notice is given, and at no other time pr ior to the giving of the 24

Sec. 10.  14 MRSA §6010 as corrected by RR 201 3, c. 2, §26, is amended by 16

tenant's guest is li able to the tenant for the tenant's damages as a result of the domestic 20 
violence, sexual assault or stalking regardless of whether or not the perpetrator is also a 21 
tenant.  Such damages include, but are not limited to, moving costs, back rent, current 22 
rent, damage to the unit, court costs and attorney's fees.  23 
Nothing in this section relating to damages as a result of domestic violence, sexual 24 
assault or stalking creates liability on behalf of a landlord.  25 
Sec. 11.  14 MRSA §6025, sub -§1, as amended by PL 199 9, c. 204, §1, is further 26 
amended to read:  27

tenants, workers or contractors.  32 
A tenant may not change the lock to the dwelling unit without giving notice to the 33 
landlord a nd giving the landlord a duplicate key within 48 hours of the change.  A victim 34 
may change the locks to the unit at the victim's expense.  If the victim changes the locks 35 
to the unit, the victim shall provide the landlord with a duplicate key within 72 hou rs of 36 
changing the locks.  For the purposes of this subsection, "victim" has the same meaning 37 
as in section 6000, subsection 4.  38
