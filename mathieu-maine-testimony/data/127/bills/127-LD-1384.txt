influence of a substance of abuse , prov ided that the .  The existence of probable cause 32 
may be based on a single work -related accident that results in personal injury or 33 
significant damage to property, as "significant damage" is defined in the employer's 34

procedure of the employer's employee assistance program ; 34 
B.  When substance abuse testing may occur. The written policy must describe:  35 
(1)  Which positions, if any, will be subject to testing, including any positions 36

 Page 3 - 127LR045 8(01) -1 
 (2)  The procedure to be followed in selecting employees to be tested on a 1 
random or arbitrary basis under section 684, subsection 3;  2 
C.  The collection of samples.  3 
(1)  The collec tion of any sample for use in a substance abuse test must be 4 
conducted in a medical facility and supervised by a licensed physician or nurse.  5 
A medical facility includes a first aid station located at the work site.  6 
(2)  An employer may not require an emp loyee or applicant to remove any 7 
clothing for the purpose of collecting a urine sample, except that:  8 
(a)  An employer may require that an employee or applicant leave any 9 
personal belongings other than clothing and any unnecessary coat, jacket or 10 
similar ou ter garments outside the collection area; or  11 
(b)  If it is the standard practice of an off -site medical facility to require the 12 
removal of clothing when collecting a urine sample for any purpose, the 13 
physician or nurse supervising the collection of the sam ple in that facility 14 
may require the employee or applicant to remove their clothing.  15 
(3)  No employee or applicant may be required to provide a urine sample while 16 
being observed, directly or indirectly, by another individual.  17 
(4)  The employer may take add itional actions necessary to ensure the integrity of 18 
a urine sample if the sample collector or testing laboratory determines that the 19 
sample may have been substituted, adulterated, diluted or otherwise tampered 20 
with in an attempt to influence test results.   The Department of Health and 21 
Human Services shall adopt rules governing when those additional actions are 22 
justified and the scope of those actions.  These rules may not permit the direct or 23 
indirect observation of the collection of a urine sample.  If an  employee or 24 
applicant is found to have twice substituted, adulterated, diluted or otherwise 25 
tampered with the employee's or applicant's urine sample, as determined under 26 
the rules adopted by the department, the employee or applicant is deemed to have 27 
refused to submit to a substance abuse test.  28 
(5)  If the employer proposes to use the type of screening test described in section 29 
682, subsection 7, paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the employer's policy must 30 
include:  31 
(a)  Procedures to ensure the confidentialit y of test results as required in 32 
section 685, subsection 3; and  33 
(b)  Procedures for training persons performing the test in the proper manner 34 
of collecting samples and reading results, maintaining a proper chain of 35 
custody and complying with other applicab le provisions of this subchapter;  36 
D.  The storage of samples before testing sufficient to inhibit deterioration of the 37 
sample;  38 
E.  The chain of custody of samples sufficient to protect the sample from tampering 39 
and to verify the identity of each sample and  test result;  40 
F.  The substances of abuse to be tested for;  41 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR0458(01) -1 
 G.  The cutoff levels for both screening and confirmation tests at which the presence 1 
of a substance of abuse in a sample is considered a positive test result.  2 
(1)  Cutoff levels for confirmation tests for marijuana may not be lower than 15 3 
nanograms of delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol -9-carboxylic acid per milliliter for 4 
urine samples.  5 
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt rules under 6 
section 687 regulating screening and confirm ation cutoff levels for other 7 
substances of abuse, including those substances tested for in blood samples under 8 
subsection 5, paragraph B, to ensure that levels are set within known tolerances 9 
of test methods and above mere trace amounts.  An employer may request that 10 
the Department of Health and Human Services establish a cutoff level for any 11 
substance of abuse for which the department has not established a cutoff level.  12 
(3)  Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2), if the Department of Health and 13 
Human Services does not have established cutoff levels or procedures for any 14 
specific federally recognized substance abuse test, the minimum cutoff levels and 15 
procedures that apply are those set forth in the Federal Register, Volume 69, No. 16 
71, sections 3.4 to 3 .7 on pages 19697 and 19698;  17 
H.  The consequences of a confirmed positive substance abuse test result;  18 
I.  The consequences for refusal to submit to a substance abuse test;  19 
J.  Opportunities and procedures for rehabilitation following a confirmed positive 20 
result;  21 
K.  A procedure under which an employee or applicant who receives a confirmed 22 
positive result may appeal and contest the accuracy of that result.  The policy must 23 
include a mechanism that provides an opportunity to appeal at no cost to the 24 
appellan t; and  25 
L.  Any other matters required by rules adopted by the Department of Labor under 26 
section 687.  27 
An employer must consult with the employer's employees in the development of any 28 
portion of a substance abuse testing policy under this subsection that rel ates to the 29 
employees.  The employer is not required to consult with the employees on those portions 30 
of a policy that relate only to applicants.  The employer shall send a copy of the final 31 
written policy to the Department of Labor for review under section  686.  The employer 32 
may not implement the policy until the Department of Labor approves the policy.  The 33 
employer shall send a copy of any proposed change in an approved written policy to the 34 
Department of Labor for review under section 686.  The employer may not implement the 35 
change until the Department of Labor approves the change.  36 
The Commissioner of Labor shall develop model substance abuse policy templates to 37 
provide to employers in the State to use in developing policies pursuant to this 38 
subsection.  The commissioner shall ensure that the templates, which must be made 39 
available in an electronic form, provide employers adequate flexibility so as to facilitate 40 
the ability of the employers' substance abuse testing programs and policies to meet the 41 
require ments of this subchapter.  42

 Sec. 9.  26 MRSA §684, sub -§2, as amended by PL 1989, c. 832, §10, is further 1 
amended to read:  2 
2.  Probable cause testing of employees.  An employer may require , request or 3 
suggest  that an employee submit to a substance abuse test  if the employer has probable 4 
cause to test the employee.  5 
A.  The employee's immediate supervisor, other supervisory personnel, a licensed 6 
physician or nurse, or the employer's security personnel shall make the determination 7 
of probable cause.  8 
B.  The supe rvisor or other person must state, in writing, the facts upon which this 9 
determination is based and provide a copy of the statement to the employee.  10 
Sec. 10.  26 MRSA §684, sub -§3, as amended by PL 2003, c. 547, §2, is further 11 
amended to read:  12 
3.  Random o r arbitrary testing of employees.  In addition to testing employees on 13 
a probable cause basis under subsection 2, an employer may require , request or suggest  14 
that an employee submit to a substance abuse test on a random or arbitrary basis if:  15 
A.  The emplo yer and the employee have bargained for provisions in a collective 16 
bargaining agreement, either before or after the effective date of this subchapter, that 17 
provide for random or arbitrary testing of employees.  A random or arbitrary testing 18 
program that wo uld result from implementation of an employer's last best offer is not 19 
considered a provision bargained for in a collective bargaining agreement for 20 
purposes of this section;  21 
B.  The employee works in a position the nature of which would create an 22 
unreason able threat to the health or safety of the public or the employee's coworkers 23 
if the employee were under the influence of a substance of abuse.  It is the intent of 24 
the Legislature that the requirements of this paragraph be narrowly construed; or  25 
C.  The e mployer has established a random or arbitrary testing program under this 26 
paragraph that applies to all employees, except as provided in subparagraph (4), 27 
regardless of position.  28 
(1)  An employer may establish a testing program under this paragraph only if the 29 
employer has 50 10 or more employees who are not covered by a collective 30 
bargaining agreement.  31 
(2)  The written policy required by section 683, subsection 2 with respect to a 32 
testing program under this paragraph must be developed by a committee of at 33 
least 10 of the employer's employees.  The employer shall appoint members to 34 
the committee from a cross -section of employees who are eligible to be tested.  35 
The committee must include a medical professional who is trained in procedures 36 
for testing for subst ances of abuse.  If no such person is employed by the 37 
employer, the employer shall obtain the services of such a person to serve as a 38 
member of the committee created under this subparagraph.  39 
(3)  The written policy developed under subparagraph (2) must als o require that 40 
selection of employees for testing be performed by a person or entity not subject 41 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0458(01) -1 
 to the employer's influence, such as a medical review officer.  Selection must be 1 
made from a list, provided by the employer, of all employees subject to testi ng 2 
under this paragraph. The list may not contain information that would identify the 3 
employee to the person or entity making the selection.  4 
(4)  Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement are not 5 
included in testing programs pursuant t o this paragraph unless they agree to be 6 
included pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement as described under 7 
paragraph A.  8 
(5)  Before initiating a testing program under this paragraph, the employer must 9 
obtain from the Department of Labor approval of  the policy developed by the 10 
employee committee, as required in section 686.  If the employer does not 11 
approve of the written policy developed by the employee committee, the 12 
employer may decide not to submit the policy to the department and not to 13 
establis h the testing program.  The employer may not change the written policy 14 
without approval of the employee committee.  15 
(6)  The employer may not discharge, suspend, demote, discipline or otherwise 16 
discriminate with regard to compensation or working conditions against an 17 
employee for participating or refusing to participate in an employee committee 18 
created pursuant to this paragraph.  19 
Sec. 11.  26 MRSA §685, sub -§2, ¶C, as amended by PL 1995, c. 344, §1, is 20 
further amended to read:  21 
C.  If the employee chooses not  to participate in a rehabilitation program under this 22 
subsection, the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.  If the 23 
employee chooses to participate in a rehabilitation program, the following provisions 24 
apply.  25 
(1)  If the employer has an e mployee assistance program that offers counseling or 26 
rehabilitation services, the employee may choose to enter that program at the 27 
employer's expense .  If these services are not available from an employer's 28 
employee assistance program or if the employee ch ooses not to participate in that 29 
program, the employee may enter a public or private rehabilitation program.  30 
(a)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 31 
plan and are not required or agreed upon by the employer , the costs of  the 32 
public or private rehabilitation program must be equally divided between the 33 
employer and employee if the employer has more than 20 full -time 34 
employees.  This requirement does not apply to municipalities or other 35 
political subdivisions of the State or  to any employer when the employee is 36 
tested because of the alcohol and controlled substance testing mandated by 37 
the federal Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, Public 38 
Law 102 -143, Title V.  If necessary, the  are the responsibility of the 39 
employee.  Rehabilitation costs otherwise incurred that are not covered by 40 
group health insurance are the responsibility of the employee, except that 41 
nothing in this division precludes an employer from contributing to the cost 42 
of such rehabilitation if the  employer elects to do so.  The  employer 43 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR045 8(01) -1 
 shall  may assist in financing the cost share of the employee through a payroll 1 
deduction plan.  2 
(b)  Except to the extent that costs are covered by a group health insurance 3 
plan, an employer with 20 or fewer full -time employees, a municipality or 4 
other political subdivision of the State  is not required to pay for any costs of 5 
rehabilitation or treatment under any public or private rehabilitation program.  6 
An employer is not required to pay for the costs of rehabilitat ion if the 7 
employee was tested because of the alcohol and controlled substance testing 8 
mandated by the federal Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 9 
1991, Public Law 102 -143, Title V.  10 
(2)  No employer may take any action described in paragraph A w hile an 11 
employee is participating in a rehabilitation program, except as provided in 12 
subparagraph (2 -A) and except that an employer may change the employee's 13 
work assignment or suspend the employee from active duty to reduce any 14 
possible safety hazard.  Ex cept as provided in subparagraph (2 -A), an employee's 15 
pay or benefits may not be reduced while an employee is participating in a 16 
rehabilitation program, provided that the employer is not required to pay the 17 
employee for periods in which the employee is una vailable for work for the 18 
purposes of rehabilitation or while the employee is medically disqualified.  The 19 
employee may apply normal sick leave and vacation time, if any, for these 20 
periods.  21 
(2-A)  A rehabilitation or treatment provider shall promptly notif y the employer 22 
if the employee fails to comply with the prescribed rehabilitation program before 23 
the expiration of the 6 -month period provided in paragraph B.  Upon receipt of 24 
this notice, the employer may take any action described in paragraph A.  25 
(3)  Exc ept as provided in divisions (a) and (b), upon successfully completing the 26 
rehabilitation program, as determined by the rehabilitation or treatment provider 27 
after consultation with the employer, the employee is entitled to return to the 28 
employee's previous  job with full pay and benefits unless conditions unrelated to 29 
the employee's previous confirmed positive result make the employee's return 30 
impossible.  Reinstatement of the employee must not conflict with any provision 31 
of a collective bargaining agreement  between the employer and a labor 32 
organization that is the collective bargaining representative of the unit of which 33 
the employee is or would be a part.  If the rehabilitation or treatment provider 34 
determines that the employee has not successfully complete d the rehabilitation 35 
program within 6 months after starting the program, the employer may take any 36 
action described in paragraph A.  37 
(a)  If the employee who has completed rehabilitation previously worked in 38 
an employment position subject to random or arbit rary testing under an 39 
employer's written policy, the employer may refuse to allow the employee to 40 
return to the previous job if the employer believes that the employee may 41 
pose an unreasonable safety hazard because of the nature of the position.  42 
The emplo yer shall attempt to find suitable work for the employee 43 
immediately after refusing the employee's return to the previous position.  No 44 
reduction may be made in the employee's previous benefits or rate of pay 45 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR0458(01) -1 
 while awaiting reassignment to work or while wo rking in a position other 1 
than the previous job.  The employee shall be reinstated to the previous 2 
position or to another position with an equivalent rate of pay and benefits and 3 
with no loss of seniority within 6 months after returning to work in any 4 
capacity with the employer unless the employee has received a subsequent 5 
confirmed positive result within that time from a test administered under this 6 
subchapter or unless conditions unrelated to the employee's previous 7 
confirmed positive test result make tha t reinstatement or reassignment 8 
impossible.  Placement of the employee in suitable work and reinstatement 9 
may not conflict with any provision of a collective bargaining agreement 10 
between the employer and a labor organization that is the collective 11 
bargaini ng representative of the unit of which the employee is or would be a 12 
part. 13 
(b)  Notwithstanding division (a), if an employee who has successfully 14 
completed rehabilitation is medically disqualified, the employer is not 15 
required to reinstate the employee or find suitable work for the employee 16 
during the period of disqualification.  The employer is not required to 17 
compensate the employee during the period of disqualification.  Immediately 18 
after the employee's medical disqualification ceases, the employer's 19 
obligations under division (a) attach as if the employee had successfully 20 
completed rehabilitation on that date.  21 
SUMMARY  22 
This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing employment practices 23 
concerning substance abuse testing.  24 
1.  It specifies that  employers may establish policies or rules related to the possession 25 
or use of substances of abuse by employees and for employee impairment by substances 26 
of abuse at the workplace.  27 
2.  It repeals a section of law that addresses nuclear power plants since t here are no 28 
operating nuclear power plants in this State.  29 
3.  It authorizes an employer that has employees subject to a federally mandated 30 
substance abuse testing program to extend its federal drug testing activities to its entire 31 
workforce in order to mai ntain a single testing program and specifies that the employer 32 
must maintain the privacy protections that Maine statute affords all other Maine 33 
employees.  34 
4.  Current law prohibits a single work -related accident from forming the basis of 35 
probable cause to believe that an employee may be under the influence of a substance of 36 
abuse.  This bill amends the law to provide that a single work -related accident that results 37 
in injury or significant property damage may be probable cause to suspect an employee is 38 
unde r the influence of a substance of abuse.  39 
 
 Page 9 - 127LR045 8(01) -1 
 5.  It eliminates the current requirement that, prior to establishing a substance abuse 1 
testing program, an employer with over 20 full -time employees have a functioning 2 
employee assistance program.  3 
6.  It directs th e Commissioner of Labor to develop model policy templates with 4 
adequate flexibility so as to facilitate the ability of the employers’ substance abuse testing 5 
programs and policies to meet the requirements of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 26, 6 
chapter 7,  subchapter 3 -A to develop new policies or update existing policies.  7 
7.  It expands the number of establishments that can undertake companywide random 8 
substance abuse testing from those with 50 or more employees to those with 10 or more 9 
employees.  10 
8.  The bill eliminates the requirement that employers share an employee's 11 
rehabilitation costs not covered by group health insurance and clarifies that rehabilitation 12 
costs not covered by a group health insurance program are the responsibility of the 13 
employee.  14 
9.  It specifies that testing at the point of collection of saliva or urine is permissible 15 
for both applicants for employment and for employees.  16
