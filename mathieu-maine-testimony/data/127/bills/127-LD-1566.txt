 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §840, sub -§§1-A and 1 -B are enacted to read:  2 
1-A.  Mandatory mediation.  Prior to the department’s initiating a hearing for 3 
establishing a water level regime and, if applicable,  minimum flow requirements in 4 
response to a petition or request that meets the requirements in subsection 1, the parties 5 
named in the petition or request must attempt to establish a water level management plan 6 
through mediation by an independent 3rd -party mediator.  The department is not required 7 
to take part in the mediation.  The department shall place the request or petition to 8 
establish a water level regime and, if applicable, minimum flow requirements on hold for 9 
a period of up to one year from the dat e of acceptance to allow mediation to occur.  The 10 
on-hold period may be extended upon written agreement between the parties to the 11 
petition or request and the department.  If mediation results in a water level management 12 
plan acceptable to all parties to a  petition or request, that water level management plan 13 
must be recorded at the appropriate registry of deeds and is binding and civilly 14 
enforceable on the affected parties, unless the department issues a subsequent order 15 
establishing a water level regime a nd, if applicable, minimum flow requirements for the 16 
body of water in question.  Establishment of a water level management plan through 17 
mediation relieves the department of any obligation it has to hold an adjudicatory hearing 18 
and issue an order in respons e to a petition or request, and the department shall return the 19 
petition or request to the submittor.  20 
1-B.  Fees.  A petition or request that meets the requirements in subsection 1 for 21 
establishing a water level regime and, if applicable, minimum flow requ irements must be 22 
accompanied by a processing fee established by the department.  If the department holds 23 
an adjudicatory hearing as a result of a petition or request, the department may charge the 24 
parties named in the petition or request an appropriate lic ensing fee, not to exceed 25 
$20,000, sufficient to cover costs incurred in conducting the hearing and reviewing 26 
evidence, including the time spent by state employees and necessary consultants and 27 
contractors in preparing, presenting and reviewing testimony, and in preparation of a 28 
department order establishing a water level regime and, if applicable, minimum flow 29 
requirements.  The department shall ensure that any licensing fee assessed under this 30 
subsection is apportioned equitably among the parties named in  a petition or request.  All 31 
fees must be established in accordance with section 352.  32
