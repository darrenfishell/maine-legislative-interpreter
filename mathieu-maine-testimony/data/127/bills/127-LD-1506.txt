 SUMMARY  1 
This bill makes the following changes to the Maine tax laws.  2 
1.  It corrects an inadvertent change made by Public Law 2015, chapter 267 to the 3 
individual income tax pension deduction for tax years beginning in 2014 and 2015 that, 4 
without this correction, would result in a requirement that military pensions be offset by 5 
social security benefits and railroad retirement bene fits received by the taxpayer during 6 
the taxable year.  The law prior to the change by Public Law 2015, chapter 267 did not 7 
require the social security benefits and railroad retirement benefits offset.  This change is 8 
retroactive to June 30, 2015, the effe ctive date of Public Law 2015, chapter 267.  9 
2.  It clarifies the offset of social security and railroad retirement benefits in 10 
calculating the pension income deduction for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 11 
2016.  12 
3.  It removes an incorrect referen ce to "tax years beginning in 2014" that appears in 13 
the individual income tax pension deduction provision that applies to tax years beginning 14 
after 2015.  15 
4.  It updates references to the statutory provisions governing the pension deduction 16 
in order to refl ect recent changes.  17
