SUMMARY 
2 This amendment provides technical corrections to the bill and rewrites the proposed 
3 changes to the law regarding filing copies of the proceedings in murder and felony 
4 murder cases. 
5 The amendment changes the requirements applicable to the assembling of records in 
6 cases in which a person is convicted of murder or felony murder. With respect to the 
7 records that must be assembled, the amendment repeals the requirement that a copy of the 
8 Maine Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 11 be included, requires inclusion of a 
9 transcript of the plea hearing and jury instructions and repeals the requirement that the 
10 charge of the presiding justice be included. The amendment makes the same changes in 
11 the law requiring the clerk of court to provide certain records to the Secretary of State for 
12 use by the Governor in a pardon hearing.
