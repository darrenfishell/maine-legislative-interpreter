amended to read:  3 
1.  Minimum wage.   The minimum hourly wage is $6.50 per hour.  Starting October 4 
1, 2006, the minimum  hourly wage is $6.75 per hour.  Starting October 1, 2007, the 5 
minimum hourly wage is $7.00 per hour.  Starting October 1, 2008, the minimum hourly 6 
wage is $7.25 per hour.  Starting October 1, 2009, the minimum hourly wage is  $7.50 per 7 
hour.  Starting Janu ary 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting 8 
January 1, 2018, the minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, 9 
the minimum hourly wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum 10 
hourly wage is $12 .00 per hour.  On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the 11 
minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost 12 
of living. The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the percentage increase, 13 
if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August of the year preceding 14 
that year in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, 15 
CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published by the United 16 
States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor agency, with the 17 
amount of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 5¢.   If the 18 
highest federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in effect 19 
under this section, the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same amount, 20 
effective on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, but in no case 21 
may the minimum wage exceed the minimum wage otherwise in effect under this sectio n 22 
by more than $1 per hour  and must be increased in accordance with this section 23 
thereafter . 24 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §664, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 118, §3, is further 25 
amended to read:  26 
2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages o f a service 27 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 28 
established in this section.  Starting January 1, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid 29 
directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour, and the tip 30 
credit may not exceed the difference between the minimum cash wage paid directly to a 31 
tipped service employee and the minimum hourly wage established under subsection 1.  32 
Starting January 1, 2018, and on each January 1st thereafter, the minimum cash wa ge 33 
paid directly to a tipped service employee must be increased by an additional $1.00 per 34 
hour until it reaches the same amount as the annually adjusted minimum hourly wage 35 
established under subsection 1, except that if the minimum cash wage paid directly  to a 36 
tipped service employee is less than $1.00 less than the annually adjusted minimum 37 
hourly wage, it must be increased by that lesser amount.   An employer who elects to use 38 
the tip credit , until it is eliminated under this subsection,  must inform the a ffected 39 
employee in advance and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the 40 
minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are combined.  Upon a 41 
satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's representative that the actua l tips 42 
received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall increase the direct wages by the 43 
difference.  44

 The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 1 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automaticall y included in the customer's 2 
bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 3 
employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 4 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be h eld while the employer is awaiting 5 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  6 
SUMMARY  7 
This initiated bill raises the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour in 2017 and by $1.00 8 
per hour each year after that until it is $12.00 per hour in 2020.  The minimum wage the n 9 
increases at the same rate as the cost of living.  The minimum wage for workers who 10 
receive tips increases to $5.00 per hour in 2017 and then by $1.00 per hour each year 11 
until it matches the minimum wage for all other workers, which occurs no sooner than  12 
2024.  13
