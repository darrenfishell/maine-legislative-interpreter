implementing and administering the program and any loans or bonds authorized by this 
section. 
4. Criteria to qualify for financial support. The authority shall provide financial 
support as described in subsection 5 to an applicant to support a business development 
project based in part on criteria that include but are not limited to: 
A. The creditworthiness of the applicant, considering factors such as the applicant's 
historical financial performance, management ability, plan to market the applicant's 
product or service and whether the applicant meets or exceeds industry average 
financial performance ratios commonly accepted in determining creditworthiness in 
that industry; 
B. The sufficiency of collateral pledged by the applicant; 
C. The sufficiency of projected revenues from the project or other sources to repay 
the financial obligation and meet the requirements of subsection 5 for the term of the 
obligation; 
D. The extent to which financial support from the authority would enhance the 
employment and wage benefits projected to be created by the business development 
project; 
E. The duration of the employment and wage benefits projected to be created by the 
business development project; and 
F. The demonstration that the financial support from the authority is necessary due to 
the reduced cost and increased flexibility of the financial support and not due to the 
applicant's inability to obtain financing from another source. 
5. Financial support. The authority may provide the following financial support to a 
qualified program applicant: 
A. A direct loan of up to $50,000,000 from the fund for a single business 
development project, which must be matched by an amount equal to at least 50% of 
the loan that is obtained from another source; or 
B. Up to $100,000,000 in bond funding for a single business development project 
and up to $200,000,000 to the same applicant for multiple business development 
projects. 
The authority may require other terms or conditions of financial support under this 
subsection as the authority determines necessary and reasonable. 
6. Bonding authorization. The authority may provide by resolution for the issuance 
of bonds for the purpose of funding business development projects, except that the bonds 
may not constitute a general obligation of the authority and the authority may not pledge 
an obligation under section 1053 or otherwise seek an appropriation for repayment. 
Bonds issued under this subsection may not constitute a debt of the State, or of any 
agency or political subdivision of the State, and are payable solely from the revenues of 
the business development project for which the bonds are issued. Neither the full faith 
nor credit nor taxing power of the State or any political subdivision of the State may be 
pledged to payment of bonds issued under this subsection. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, any bonds issued pursuant to this subsection are fully negotiable. If any
