SUMMARY  24 
Under a tax credit that expired January 1, 2014, a taxpayer that qualified for a 25 
research expense tax credit was allowed a so -called super credit for qualified research 26 
expenses for research conducted in this State.  A taxpayer was allowed to carry over any 27 
unused credit for the next succeeding 10 years, except that the credit was limit ed to no 28 
more than 25% of the taxpayer's tax due after the allowance of other tax credits.  29 
This bill restores the availability of the super credit, retroactive to January 1, 2014, 30 
restricts the carry -over period to 5 years and increases the limit on the cr edit to no more 31 
than 50% of the taxpayer's tax due after the allowance of other tax credits.  32
