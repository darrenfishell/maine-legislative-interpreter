STATE OF MAINE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
127TH LEGISLATURE 
FmST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 482, L.D. 706, "Resolve, To Establish 
a Commission To Study Transportation Funding Reform" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, adequate, sustainable and predictable transportation funding is critical to 
the safety and economic well-being of all Maine citizens; and 
Whereas, funding for transportation infrastructure in Maine and the nation is 
seriously deficient; and 
Whereas, the shortfall of funding related to Maine's state highway and bridge 
system is at least $150,000,000 per year, without consideration of general obligation 
bonding; and 
Whereas, general obligation bonding levels are unpredictable due to the current 
short-term focus of the process that detennines bonding levels and priorities, a process 
that usually takes place late in a legislative session after fmalization of the General Fund 
budget, if at all; and 
Whereas, higher fuel efficiency of vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles continue to 
erode the funding provided by per gallon fuel taxes and increase the inequity among 
drivers in terms of the fee paid per mile for use ofthe highway and bridge system; and 
Whereas, fuel prices are relatively low but surely will rise in the years ahead; and 
Whereas, approximately 30,000,000 people visit Maine each year, a state with a 
year-round population of about 1,300,000 people, and the capacity and a significant 
portion of the cost of Maine's transportation system are driven by seasonal traffic 
volumes; and

Whereas, through years of capital planning, prioritization and efficiency initiatives, 
the Department of Transportation has proven that it uses funding efficiently and 
effectively and can be trusted to do so with additional funding; and 
Whereas, federal transportation funding is unpredictable and a predictable longÂ­
term federal solution to Maine's transportation funding problem is unlikely; and 
Whereas, other states are finding transportation funding solutions and the State of 
Maine has an obligation to all Maine citizens to seek solutions now; and 
Whereas, the Commission To Study Transportation Funding Reform established in 
this resolve is a bipartisan commission charged with analyzing options and 
recommending legislation and is the best way to reform and supplement transportation 
funding in Maine; and 
Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that 
the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
legislative session; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Commission established. Resolved: That the Commission To Study 
Transportation Funding Reform, referred to in this resolve as "the commission," is 
established; and be it further 
Sec. 2. Commission membership. Resolved: That the commission consists of 
11 members as follows: 
1. Three Legislators appointed by the President of the Senate, at least one of whom is 
from the party holding the 2nd largest number of seats in the Senate, including at least 
one member of the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation and one member of 
either the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial Affairs or the Joint 
Standing Committee on Taxation; 
2. Seven Legislators appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, at 
least 3 of whom are from the party holding the 2nd largest number of seats in the House, 
including at least one member of the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation and 
one member of either the Joint Standing Committee on Appropriations and Financial 
Affairs or the Joint Standing Committee on Taxation; and 
3. The Commissioner of Transportation, or the commissioner's designee; and be it 
further 
Sec. 3. Chairs. Resolved: That the first-named Senate member is the Senate 
chair and the frrst-named House of Representatives member is the House chair of the 
connmSSlOn. The frrst-named Senate member must be from the Joint Standing 
Committee on Transportation and the first-named House member must be from the Joint 
Standing Committee on Transportation; and be it further

Sec. 4. Appointments; convening of commission. Resolved: That all 
appointments must be made no later than 30 days following the effective date of this 
resolve. The appointing authorities shall notify the Executive Director of the Legislative 
Council once all appointments have been completed. After appointment of all members, 
the chairs shall call and convene the first meeting of the commission. If 30 days or more 
after the effective date of this resolve a majority of but not all appointments have been 
made, the chairs may request authority and the Legislative Council may grant authority 
for the commission to meet and conduct its business; and be it further 
Sec. 5. Duties. Resolved: That the commission shall study how to reform and 
adequately supplement funding for the State's transportation infrastructure to promote 
equity, sustainability and predictability in a manner that allows the State to responsibly 
provide a safe and reliable state transportation system. The study must focus on funding 
the state highway and bridge system, but must also consider capital funding through 
bonding of multimodal infrastructure. The commission shall: 
1. Determine funding levels necessary to achieve the highway and bridge capital 
goals set forth in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 73, subsection 7, 
paragraphs A to D, including anticipated shortfalls, for the next 10 years; 
2. Identify mechanisms that will increase the predictability of general obligation 
bonding levels for capital planning at the Department of Transportation for the state 
highway and bridge system and multimodal infrastructure for the next 10 years; 
3. Identify mechanisms to address the erosion of Highway Fund receipts and the 
rising inequity among drivers caused by higher automobile fuel efficiency and alternative 
fuel vehicles, such as adding a registration fee surcharge on hybrid, electric or other 
alternative fuel passenger automobiles; 
4. Consider a voluntary so-called "vehicle miles traveled" pilot program for 
passenger automobiles; 
5. Identify methods to more equitably share the costs of the highway system between 
residents of this State and nonresidents, including exploring the feasibility of reducing 
year-round baseline gasoline tax rates and adding a seasonal gasoline tax surcharge; 
6. Consider new highway tolling options; 
7. Consider adding a wholesale fuel tax component, including options that would 
reduce baseline per gallon fuel tax rates; 
8. Consider adjusting fuel tax rates, including options that can be implemented or 
eliminated as fuel prices rise due to market forces or increases to the federal fuel tax 
rates; 
9. Consider dedicating a portion of sales tax receipts from transportation-related 
sales to transportation infrastructure; 
10. Evaluate the likelihood, extent and time frame of possible future funds being 
dedicated to transportation infrastructure from revenues from potential additional casinos 
in the State; and 
11. Invite knowledgeable stakeholders to provide written and oral comments on draft 
recommendations of the commission. Knowledgeable stakeholders must include
