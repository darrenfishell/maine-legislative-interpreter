This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
amendment establishes a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino 
in either York County or Cumberland County. The amendment establishes the Casino 
Development Commission, which is an independent board of 5 members appointed by 
the Governor and confinned by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Gambling Control 
Board for a casino operator license. Prior to submitting a request for proposals, either 
York County or Cumberland County, or both, would have to hold a referendum vote 
asking voters to allow the operation of a casino in their county. The referendum must be 
held on the same date as a statewide election no sooner than June I, 2016 and no later 
than July 1, 2017. The fee to submit a bid is $250,000. The amendment provides for 
specific supporting information to be submitted by the bidder and considered by the 
commission including the bidder's ability to make a minimum $250,000,000 capital 
investment in the resort-style casino and information regarding job creation, economic 
development, plans to mitigate negative infrastructure impacts and the bidder's support of 
the harness racing industry. Under the amendment, the commission is directed to develop 
a point system for the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and give priority to 
proposals that create jobs, promote economic development, increase tourism and support 
a casino that fits the character of the State. The winning bidder must enter into a contract 
with the commission that obligates the casino operator to abide by the proposals made in 
the winning bid. Failure to abide by the tenns of the contract could result in financial 
penalties to the casino operator.

If York and Washington counties choose to hold referendums during the state primary election in June 2016, the 
Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $11,772 for ballot printing costs and 
postage. If the counties choose to hold referendums during the general election in November 2016, the Department of 
Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $14,464 for ballot printing costs and postage only if the 
questions require printing a separate ballot. 
The bill establishes the Fund to Reform Veterans Services in the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
Services with a base Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) allocation of$500 beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 in order 
to allow the department to spend any mpnies received. 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for a casino to a single 
applicant. Bidders will pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The fiscal note assumes this will 
be credited to the General Fund. The Gambling Control Board will accept an application for a casino license in either 
York County or Cumberland County from the winning bidder as long as the voters of the county and municipality where 
the proposed casino will be located have voted to approve a casino. Only one casino, in either York or Cumberland 
County, may be licensed. 
LR1572(02) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of 3 
C ItA 1\ (-H-y-q 1\ 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 46% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income. Th;bill requirela 
casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital improvements to the casino 
using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct those funds to the Gambling Control 
Board. This fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the Gambling Control Board. This fiscal 
note assumes a total of 1,000 slot machines and 24 table games, generating an estimated annual revenue of $31,709,674 
in OSRF revenue and $1,257,931 in General Fund revenue. 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license is 
$25,000,000, with $5,000,000 going to the General Fund and $20,000,000 going into an OSRF account within the 
Gambling Control Board. $102,400 will be generated annually from registration fees of $100 per slot machine and per 
table game. The $20,000,000 will remain in the OSRF account for 5 years and then be transferred to the Department of 
Transportation, Highway and Bridge Capital Program if Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino continue to operate and 
provide revenue to host municipalities and counties. If either ceases to operate, then distribution will be made from the 
OSRF account to compensate municpalities and counties, with the distributions lasting 5 years. Annual state costs 
associated with 5 inspectors, an auditor and other related expenses are estimated to be $523,510. 
WhiteSand Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in revenue to 
Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to opened. This fiscal note assumes the same 20% reduction, 
resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of$347,495 and OSRF revenue loss of$5,410,437. An 
assessment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood Casino has not been done at this time.
