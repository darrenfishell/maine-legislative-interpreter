 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 363 and Private and Special 3 
Law 2015, chapte r 6 make a partial allocation of the state ceiling on private activity 4 
bonds to some issuers for calendar year 2016 but leave a portion of the state ceiling 5 
unallocated and do not provide sufficient allocations for certain types of private activity 6 
bonds t hat may require an allocation prior to the effective date of this Act if not enacted 7 
on an emergency basis; and  8 
Whereas, if these bond issues must be delayed due to the lack of available state 9 
ceiling, the rates and terms under which these bonds may be iss ued may be adversely 10 
affected, resulting in increased costs to beneficiaries or even unavailability of financing 11 
for certain projects; and  12 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 13
