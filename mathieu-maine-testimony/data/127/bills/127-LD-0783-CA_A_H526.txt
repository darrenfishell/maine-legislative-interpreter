Amend the resolution by striking out all of section 25 (page 1, lines 5 to 9 in L.D.)

'Section 25. Right to food freedom and food self-sufficiency. All individuals 
have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to acquire, produce, process, prepare, 
preserve and consume the food of their own choosing, for their own nourishment and 
sustenance, by hunting, gathering, foraging, farming, fishing, gardening and saving and 
exchanging seeds, as long as no individual commits trespassing, theft, poaching or other 
abuses of private property rights, public lands or natural resources in the acquisition of 
food. Furthermore, all individuals have a right to barter, trade and purchase food from 
the sources of their own choosing for their own bodily health and well-being. Every 
individual is fully responsible for the exercise of these rights, which may not be 
infringed.' 
Amend the resolution by striking out all of the question (page 1, lines 17 and 18 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
' "Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to declare that all 
individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to acquire, 
produce, process, prepare, preserve and consume the food of their own 
choosing for their own nourishment and sustenance and to barter, trade 
and purchase food from the sources of their own choosing for their own 
bodily health and well-being?" '
