SUMMARY  29 
This bill amends the political communications laws to require that all prereco rded 30

election clearly state at the start of the call the name of the person or organization that 34 
made or financed the expenditure for the communication.  The bill requires that, for 35 
scripted live telephone communications, if the respondent requests a dditional information 36 
on the person or organization that made or financed the expenditure for the 37 
communication, the caller must describe where such information, including information 38 
relating to the source or sources of funding for the person or organizat ion, is available for 39

organization making the call if different from the sponsor.  Current law requires only that 42
