11 SU~y 
12 This amendment, which is the minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on 
13 Judiciary, replaces the bill. The amendment deletes references to abortions performed on 
14 incapacitated persons. 
15 The amendment retains current law concerning the consent necessary for a physician 
16 to perform an abortion on a pregnant minor, but the amendment provides that an abortion 
17 may not be performed unless, in addition to the minor's receiving information and 
18 counseling, at least one of the minor's parents or guardian or adult family member 
19 consents to the abortion. The amendment does not permit a minor or a counselor to 
20 consent to an abortion without a parent's consenting, except that the amendment permits a 
21 physician to perform an abortion without the required consent if the physician determines 
22 that a medical emergency exists. The amendment retains the judicial bypass in current 
23 law that allows a minor or next friend of the minor to petition the Probate Court or 
24 District Court for consent rather than obtaining parental consent. This amendment limits 
25 who may act as the next friend of the minor to adult family members and counselors. If a 
26 pregnant minor files a petition in the Probate Court or District Court for consent to an 
27 abortion without parental consent, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the 
28 minor, and the guardian ad litem is directed to act to maintain the confidentiality of the 
29 proceedings. 
30 The amendment defines "medical emergency" and "physician."
