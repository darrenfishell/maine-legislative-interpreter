amended to read:  3 
§6323.  Sale following expiration of period of redemption  4 
1.  Procedures for all civil actions.   Upon expiration of the period of redemption, if 5 
the mortgagor or the mortgagor's successors, heirs or assigns have not redeemed the 6 
mortgage, any remaining rights of the mortgagor to possession terminate, and the 7 
mortgagee shall cause notice of a public sale of the premises stating the time, place and 8 
terms of the sale to be published once in each of 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of 9 
general circulation in the county in which the premises are located, the first publication to 10 
be made not more than 90 days a fter the expiration of the period of redemption. Except 11 
when otherwise required under 12 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1024.41 or any 12 
successor provision, the public sale must be held not less than 30 days nor more than 45 13 
days after the first date of that publication. Except for sales of premises that the court has 14 
determined to be abandoned pursuant to section 6326, the public sale may be adjourned, 15 
for any time not exceeding 7 days and from time to time until a sale is made, by 16 
announcement to tho se present at each adjournment and served upon the mortgagor .  For 17 
sales of premises that the court has determined to be abandoned pursuant to section 6326, 18 
the public sale may be adjourned once for any time not exceeding 7 days, except that the 19 
court may permit one additional adjournment for good cause shown.  Adjournments may 20 
also be made in accordance with the requirements of 12 Code of Federal Regulations, 21 
Section 1024.41 or any successor provision.  The mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may 22 
allow the mortgagor to redeem or reinstate the loan after the expiration of the period of 23 
redemption but before the public sale.  The mortgagee may convey the property to the 24 
mortgagor or execute a waiver of foreclosure, and all other rights of all other parties 25 
remain as if no foreclosure had been commenced. The mortgagee shall sell the premises 26 
to the highest bidder at the public sale and deliver a deed of that sale and the writ of 27 
possession, if a writ of possession was obtained during the foreclosure process, to the 28 
purchaser.  The deed conveys the premises free and clear of all interests of the parties in 29 
interest joined in the action. The mortgagee or any other party in interest may bid at the 30 
public sale.  If the mortgagee is the highest bidder at the public sa le, there is no obligation 31 
to account for any surplus upon a subsequent sale by the mortgagee. Any rights of the 32 
mortgagee to a deficiency claim against the mortgagors are limited to the amount 33 
established as of the date of the public sale.  The date of th e public sale is the date on 34 
which bids are received to establish the sales price, no matter when the sale is completed 35 
by the delivery of the deed to the highest bidder.  If the property is conveyed by deed 36 
pursuant to a public sale in accordance with thi s subsection, a copy of the judgment of 37 
foreclosure and evidence of compliance with the requirements of this subsection for the 38 
notice of public sale and the public sale itself must be attached to or included within the 39 
deed, or both, or otherwise be recor ded in the registry of deeds within 30 days of the date 40 
of such conveyance . 41 
2.  Additional notice requirements for civil actions commenced on or after 42 
January 1, 1995.   In foreclosures by civil action commenced on or after January 1, 1995, 43 
the mortgagee sh all cause notice of the public sale to be mailed by ordinary mail to all 44 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1427(01) -1 
 parties who appeared in the foreclosure action or to their attorneys of record.  The notice 1 
must be mailed no less than 30 calendar days before the date of sale.  Failure to provide 2 
notice of the public sale to any party who appeared does not affect the validity of the sale.  3 
3.  Extension of deadline.   Upon a showing of good cause made by a mortgagee's 4 
motion prior to the expiration of the sale deadline established by this section , the court 5 
may extend a the sale period for a period not to exceed, in the aggregate, 60 days beyond 6 
the deadline established by this section for the publication of the notice of sale or  7 
conducting the public sale.  The court may grant further extensions only upon a motion 8 
supported by evidence of a signed agreement of the parties to the foreclosure action 9 
setting forth facts establishing that the parties are engaging in loss mitigation efforts in an 10 
attempt to avoid foreclosure.  11 
4.  Mortgagee’s duty to maintai n property.  Except as otherwise provided in this 12 
subsection, in connection with the foreclosure of any residential rental property not 13 
occupied by the mortgagor, upon the expiration of the period of redemption provided for 14 
in section 6322, the mortgagee i s, for the purposes of chapter 710, deemed to be the 15 
landlord of the property.  With respect to the foreclosure of property described in section 16 
6321 -A, subsection 2 in which the mortgagee fails to conduct a public sale of the 17 
mortgaged property as require d by subsections 2 and 3, the mortgagee is deemed to be the 18 
owner of the property, with respect to the responsibility for its maintenance under any 19 
municipal ordinances or state statutes, upon the expiration of such sale deadline or any 20 
extensions thereof authorized by subsection 3.  21 
Sec. 2.  14 MRSA §6324, as amended by PL 2003, c. 20, Pt. T, §10, is further 22 
amended to read:  23 
§6324.  Proceeds of sale  24 
After first deducting the expenses incurred in making the sale, the mortgagee shall 25 
disburse the remaining pr oceeds in accordance with the provisions of the judgment.  The 26 
mortgagee shall file a report of the sale and the disbursement of the proceeds therefrom  of 27 
the sale  with the court and shall mail a copy to the mortgagor at the mortgagor's last 28 
known address.   The report of the sale must show the amount of the foreclosure judgment 29 
determined by the court and must itemize all additions to the judgment.   This report need 30 
not be accepted or approved by the court, provided that  as long as  the mortgagor or any 31 
other party in interest may contest the accounting by motion filed within 30 days of 32 
receipt of the report, but any such challenge may be for money only and does not affect 33 
the title to the real estate purchased by the highest bidder at the public sale.  Any Upon 34 
motion of the mortgagee, served upon the mortgagor and filed with the court with the 35 
report of sale, any  deficiency must be assessed against the mortgagor and an execution 36 
must be issued by the court therefor .  In the event the mortgagee has been the p urchaser at 37 
the public sale, any deficiency is limited to the difference between the fair market value 38 
of the premises at the time of the public sale, as established by an independent appraisal, 39 
and the sum due the mortgagee as established by the court wit h interest plus the expenses 40 
incurred in making the sale.  Any surplus must be paid to the mortgagor , or the 41 
mortgagor's successors, heirs or assigns in the proceeding.  If the mortgagor has not 42 
appeared personally or by an attorney, the surplus must be pa id to the clerk of courts, who 43 
shall hold the surplus in escrow for 6 months for the benefit of the mortgagor , or the 44 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR1427(01) -1 
 mortgagor's successors, heirs or assigns and, if the surplus remains unclaimed after 6 1 
months, the clerk shall pay the surplus to the Trea surer of State to be credited to the 2 
General Fund until it becomes unclaimed under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, 3 
and report and pay it to the State in accordance with that Act.  The report of sale required 4 
by this section must be filed with the court  within 45 days of the date of the public sale, 5 
without regard to the actual date of conveyance following the sale.  If the report is not 6 
filed with the court within 45 days, the mortgagee has no right to seek a deficiency 7 
judgment.  8 
SUMMARY  9 
This bill clari fies certain aspects of the post -foreclosure sale process.  10 
The bill imposes upon the mortgage holder who starts the foreclosure the burden of 11 
being treated as the owner of the property, and thus the party with the burden of 12 
maintaining it.  With this respo nsibility, foreclosing parties may be more likely to 13 
complete the foreclosure process and proceed to foreclosure sales.  14 
The bill imposes a deadline of 45 days after the completion of the foreclosure sale for 15 
the filing of the report of sale, so that, in th ose instances where a deficiency judgment is 16 
being sought, the homeowner will be put on notice of that fact shortly after the sale 17 
process is completed.  18
