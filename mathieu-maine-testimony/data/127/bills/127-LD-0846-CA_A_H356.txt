SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. This amendment provides a process for a plaintiff 
in a foreclosure by civil action to seek an expedited final hearing. 
The request for an expedited final hearing must indicate that mediation did not result 
in the settlement or dismissal of the action or indicate that the defendant has not filed an 
answer to the complaint and all parties that have filed an answer in the action have 
consented. The request must be accompanied by a consent form that informs defendants 
that they may consult with an attorney or a housing counselor before consenting to an 
expedited hearing, indicates that all of the defendants and all of the parties in interest that 
have appeared in the action have consented to an expedited final hearing and is signed by 
all of the defendants and all of the parties in interest that have appeared in the action. 
Upon receiving a properly filed request for an expedited final hearing the court must, 
as the interests of justice permit, set an expedited final hearing not less than 45 days after 
the request is filed. In the expedited hearing, notwithstanding that a default may already 
have been entered against the defendant, the defendant may appear and defend. The 
burden of proof and legal requirements for entry of a judgment of foreclosure are the 
same as in other foreclosure actions. After the expedited final hearing, the court must 
issue a written judgment of foreclosure, dismissal with or without prejudice or judgment 
for the defendant as expeditiously as the interests of justice permit.
