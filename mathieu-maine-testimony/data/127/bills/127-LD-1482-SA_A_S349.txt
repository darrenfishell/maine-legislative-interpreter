11 'Sec. 3. Board of trustees. All the affairs of the district must be managed by a 
12 board of trustees composed of 3 members who are residents of the district, to be chosen 
13 by a majority of the municipal officers of the Town of Rumford. Notwithstanding the 
14 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 6410, subsection 5, the trustees shall when 
15 necessary elect a president, clerk, treasurer and all other officers and agents for the proper 
16 conduct and management of the affairs of the district. Trustees may adopt a corporate 
17 seal. The trustees shall serve staggered 3-year terms, such that one trustee term ends each 
18 year. Notwithstanding Title 35-A, section 6410, subsection 4, the term of each trustee 
19 ends on the first Monday in August immediately following the end of the term for which 
20 that trustee was appointed; except that a trustee shall serve until a successor is appointed. 
21 Whenever the term of office of a trustee expires, the municipal officers of the Town of 
22 Rumford shall appoint a successor to serve the full term of 3 years, and in case any other 
23 vacancy arises it must be filled in like manner for the unexpired term. The trustees may 
24 also adopt and establish such bylaws as are necessary for their own convenience and the 
25 proper management of the affairs of the district. The trustees may procure an office and 
26 incur such expenses as may be necessary. Each trustee is entitled to compensation, as 
27 recommended by the trustees and approved by a majority of municipal officers of the 
28 Town of Rumford, in accordance with Title 35-A, section 6410, subsection 7. At the 
29 close of each fiscal year, the trustees shall make a detailed report of their doings, of the 
30 receipts and expenditures of the water district, of the water district's financial and

33 reports to be made and filed with the municipal officers of the Town of Rumford.'
