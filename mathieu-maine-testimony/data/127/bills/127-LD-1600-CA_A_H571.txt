127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "Pr" to H.P. 1091, L.D. 1600, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Consent to Land Transfers to the Federal Government" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 1 MRSA ยง15 is amended to read: 
ยง15. Consent of Legislature to acquisition of land by United States for public 
buildings; record of conveyances 
In accordance with the Constitution of the United States, Article 1, Section VIII, 
Clause I 7, and Acts of Congress in such cases provided, the consent of the Legislature is 
given to the acquisition by the United States, or under its authority, by purchase, 
condemnation or othetwise, of any land in this State required for the erection of 
lighthouses or for sites for customhouses, courthouses, post offices, arsenals or other 
public buildings, or for any other purposes of the government, except for the designation 
of property as a national monument pursuant to 54 United States Code, Section 320301 
(2015). Deeds and conveyances or title papers for the same shall must be recorded upon 
the land records of the county or registry district in which the land so conveyed may lie; 
and in like manner may be recorded a sufficient description by metes and bounds, courses 
and distances, of any tracts and legal divisions of any public lands belonging to the 
United States set apart by the general government for either of the purposes before 
mentioned, by an order, patent or other official paper so describing such land.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report of the committee. It removes the requirement 
for a reverter clause in a deed and conveyance or title papers in the event that land is 
given by the State to the Federal Government and the Federal Government attempts to 
designate such land a national monument. It adds language specifying that, in the case of 
designation of property as a national monument, the consent of the Legislature is not 
given to the Federal Government for the acquisition of land.
