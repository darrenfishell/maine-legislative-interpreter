SUMMARY  11 
This bill revises t he criminal laws regarding sexual exploitation, prostitution and sex 12 
trafficking of minors by increasing the maximum age of the minors in various provisions 13 
to 18 years of age, clarifying under various provisions that it is not a defense that the 14 
minor gav e consent and adding the crime of aggravated sex trafficking to the list of prior 15 
offenses that are used to enhance a charge of sex trafficking from a Class D to a Class C 16 
crime if a defendant has been convicted of 2 or more of the offenses.  The bill also  17 
amends the Child and Family Services and Child Protection Act by adding to the 18 
definition of "abuse and neglect" various criminal offenses relating to sexual exploitation, 19 
prostitution and sex trafficking of minors and creating a rebuttable presumption of  a 20 
parent's unwillingness or inability to protect a child from jeopardy in considering the 21 
termination of parental rights if a child for whom the parent was responsible is the victim 22 
of sexual exploitation, sex trafficking or aggravated sex trafficking.  23
