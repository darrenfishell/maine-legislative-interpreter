 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §1221, sub -§5, as amended by PL 2007, c. 23, §1, is repealed 2 
and the following enacted in its place:  3 
5.  Successor transfers of experience and assignment of rates; no common 4 
ownership.  The following applies to the assignment of rates and transfers of experience 5 
in successor purchases when there is substantially no common ownership, management or 6 
control between purchaser and predecessor.  7 
A.  Effective as of the date on which the  business was acquired:  8 
(1)  The executors, administrators, successors or assigns of a new employer who 9 
acquires the business of the predecessor employer in toto may acquire the 10 
experience rate of that employer with payrolls, contributions and benefits or may 11 
be assigned the state average contribution rate, whichever rate is lower; and  12 
(2)  The executors, administrators, successors or assigns of an existing employer 13 
with an established experience rate who acquires the business of the predecessor 14 
employer in  toto may acquire the experience rate of that predecessor employer 15 
with payrolls, contributions and benefits, which is then blended with the 16 
successor’s established experience rate to form a new rate, or retain the 17 
established experience rate of the succes sor, whichever is lower.  18 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §1221, sub -§5-A, as corrected by RR 2005, c. 1, §12, is 19 
amended to read:  20 
5-A.  Transfers of experience and assignment of rates involving common 21 
ownership.  Notwithstanding subsection 5, the  The following applies to  the assignment 22 
of rates and transfers of experience when there is substantial common ownership, 23 
management or control between the successor and predecessor employers . 24 
A.  If: 25 
(1)  An employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion of its trade or 26 
business, to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is 27 
substantially common ownership, management or control of the 2 employers, 28 
then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or 29 
business is transferred to the emplo yer to whom the business is transferred. The 30 
rates of both employers must be recalculated and made effective immediately 31 
upon the date of the transfer of the trade or business.  The transfer of some or all 32 
of an employer's workforce to another employer sha ll be considered a transfer of 33 
trade or business when, as the result of such transfer, the transferring employer 34 
no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred workforce, 35 
and such trade or business is performed by the employer to whom  the workforce 36 
is transferred; and  37 
(2)  Following a transfer of experience under subparagraph (1), the commissioner 38 
determines that the purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a 39 
reduced liability for contributions, then the experience ra ting accounts of the 40 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0453(01) -1 
 employers involved must be combined into a single account and a single rate 1 
assigned to such account.  2 
B.  Whenever a person who is not an employer under this chapter acquires the trade 3 
or business of an employer, the unemployment exper ience of the acquired trade or 4 
business is not transferred to that person if the commissioner finds that the person 5 
acquired the trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower 6 
rate of contributions. In such circumstances, the pe rson acquiring the trade or 7 
business is assigned the applicable new employer rate under subsection 4 -A.  In 8 
determining whether the trade or business was acquired solely or primarily for the 9 
purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the commissio ner shall consider 10 
objective factors that may include the cost of acquiring the trade or business, whether 11 
the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired trade or business, how 12 
long the business enterprise was continued or whether a substanti al number of new 13 
employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity 14 
conducted prior to acquisition.  15 
C.  If a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate paragraph A or B or any 16 
other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of a contribution 17 
rate or if a person knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a 18 
violation of such a provision, the person commits a Class D crime.  In addition, the 19 
person is subject to the following:  20 
(1)  If th e person is an employer, then that employer is assigned the highest rate 21 
assignable under this chapter for the rate year during which the violation or 22 
attempted violation occurred and for the 3 rate years immediately following that 23 
rate year, except that, if the person's business is already at the highest rate for any 24 
year or if the amount of increase in the person's rate would be less than 2% for 25 
such year, then a penalty rate of contributions of 2% of taxable wages is imposed 26 
for that year; and  27 
(2)  If th e person is not an employer, that person is subject to a fine of not more 28 
than $5,000, which must be deposited in the Special Administrative Expense 29 
Fund established under section 1164.  30 
D.  As used in this subsection, unless the context otherwise indicates , the following 31 
terms have the following meanings.  32 
(1)  "Knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate 33 
ignorance or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved.  34 
(2) "Person" has the meaning given that term by Section 7701(a)(1) of the 35 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  36 
(3) "Trade or business" includes the employer's workforce.  37 
(4)  "Violates or attempts to violate" includes, but is not limited to, intent to 38 
evade, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure.  39 
E.  The commissioner shall  adopt rules to identify the transfer or acquisition of a 40 
business for purposes of this subsection.  Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph 41 
are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 42 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR0453(01) -1 
 F.  This subsection must be interp reted and applied in such a manner as to meet the 1 
minimum requirements contained in any guidance or regulations issued by the United 2 
States Department of Labor.  3 
SUMMARY  4 
This bill changes the treatment of unemployment contribution rate assignment in 5 
success or transactions. In cases when the successor is a newly established employer, and 6 
when no substantial common ownership, management or control exists between the 7 
purchaser and the predecessor, the successor may opt to retain the predecessor’s rate or 8 
be ass igned the average contribution rate, whichever is lower. In such cases when the 9 
successor is an established employer with an existing contribution experience rate, the 10 
successor may choose to retain this rate or inherit the experience rate of the purchased  11 
business blended with the successor’s existing rate to form a new experience rate, 12 
whichever is more favorable.  13
