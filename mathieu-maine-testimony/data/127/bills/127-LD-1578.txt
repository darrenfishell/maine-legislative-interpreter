food waste composting progra m implemented under this section may involve the 37 
establishment of a traditional aerobic composting system or an anaerobic digestion 38 
system or implementation of another food waste processing technology approved by the 39

 department.  A participating entity sha ll collect data on the amount of food waste diverted 1 
from the waste stream by the program, the related cost savings realized by the 2 
participating entity and any problems encountered in implementing the program.  A 3 
participating entity shall compile this in formation into a report and transmit the report to 4 
the department on or before a date determined by the department.  5 
6.  The department shall analyze the reports submitted by the participating entities 6 
and, by January 15, 2018, shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the 7 
Legislature having jurisdiction over environmental and natural resources matters detailing 8 
the data collected by each participating entity and any additional findings and including 9 
any recommendations for legislation to impl ement permanent food waste composting 10 
programs or requirements at the state, regional, municipal or local level or to otherwise 11 
increase recycling rates for organic materials in the State.  After receiving the report, the 12 
joint standing committee may repor t out a bill relating to the report to the Second Regular 13 
Session of the 128th Legislature.  14 
SUMMARY  15 
This bill amends the State's solid waste management laws as follows.  16 
1.  It establishes a product stewardship program for small batteries.  17 
2.  It updates th e State's recycling goal.  Current statute sets a goal of recycling or 18 
composting 50% of the municipal solid waste tonnage generated each year within the 19 
State by January 1, 2014.  This bill extends that goal deadline to January 1, 2021.  20 
3.  It implements a commercial food waste composting requirement under which a 21 
large quantity commercial food waste generator that is located within 20 miles of a 22 
composting facility with available capacity to accept the food waste produced by the 23 
generator is required to d eliver all food waste produced to a composting facility for 24 
processing.  A large quantity commercial food waste generator is a commercial entity that 25 
generates one ton or more of food waste per week.  This bill authorizes the Department of 26 
Environmental Pr otection to provide a large quantity commercial food waste generator a 27 
waiver from the composting requirement if compliance would result in substantial 28 
financial hardship for the generator.  29 
4.  It eliminates the current statutory waste handling fee of $1 p er ton on the disposal 30 
at a commercial, municipal, state -owned or regional association landfill of municipal 31 
solid waste ash and front end process residue.  32 
5.  It expands the assessment of a statutory municipal solid waste surcharge.  Current 33 
statute requi res the assessment of a $2 per ton surcharge on the disposal of municipal 34 
solid waste at a commercial, municipal or regional association landfill.  This bill reduces 35 
that surcharge to $1 per ton but assesses the surcharge on municipal solid waste disposed 36 
of or received for processing, composting or other treatment at a commercial, municipal, 37 
regional association or state -owned solid waste disposal facility, solid waste processing 38 
facility, incineration facility or solid waste landfill.  39

 6.  It directs reven ues collected through the assessment of the municipal solid waste 1 
surcharge to the Maine Composting and Recycling Grant and Low -interest Loan 2 
Program, which is established by this bill.  This program provides grants and low -interest 3 
loans to public and pri vate entities to assist in the development, implementation or 4 
improvement of programs, projects, initiatives and activities designed to increase 5 
composting and recycling rates within the State.  Under the program, priority in the 6 
awarding of grants or loan s is given to municipal applicants and to applicants seeking to 7 
establish programs, projects, initiatives or activities likely to increase composting rates.  8 
7.  It directs the Department of Environmental Protection to amend existing rules or 9 
adopt new rule s regarding the returnable beverage container law to require a deposit and 10 
refund value on beverage containers containing Maine -produced apple cider and Maine - 11 
produced blueberry juice.  Under the existing statutory and regulatory framework, both of 12 
these p roducts are exempt from the returnable beverage container law.  13 
8.  It directs the Department of Environmental Protection to amend existing rules 14 
regarding the beneficial use of solid wastes to amend fuel quality standards for 15 
construction and demolition de bris wood fuel to increase allowances for chromated 16 
copper arsenate treated wood and for #4 minus fines.  17 
9.  It directs the Department of Environmental Protection to develop, implement and 18 
administer a food waste composting pilot program.  The department i s required to collect 19 
data from participating entities and by January 15, 2018 submit a report to the joint 20 
standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over environmental and natural 21 
resources matters detailing the data collected by each part icipating entity and any 22 
additional findings and including any recommendations for legislation to implement 23 
permanent food waste composting programs or requirements at the state, regional, 24 
municipal or local level or to otherwise increase recycling rates f or organic materials in 25 
the State.  After receiving the report, the committee may report out a bill relating to the 26 
report to the Second Regular Session of the 128th Legislature.  27
