This bill includes General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of 
$1,092,313 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $1,407,584 in fiscal year 2016-17 to cover additional Mainecare claims for lead 
inspections and to hire 8 limited period Environmental Specialist III positions to review inspections, issue orders to 
abate, track to make sure abatements occur and work with families on interim controls to reduce hazards until 
abatement is complete. It also provides funding for contracted lead inspections. Federal Block Grant Fund allocations 
are also included in this bill for the enhanced FMAP match. 
Current trends suggest that the number of cases of children with a confmned blood lead level of 5 to 9 ug/dL could 
decrease by half every 6-7 years. Based on this trend, DHHS estimates needing 8 limited period positions for the first 
2 years and seven limited period positions for years 3 and 4. The contracted inspections will also decrease each year.
