5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment provides that the court shall order the Department of Labor to 
7 provide employment information about a judgment debtor after the judgment debtor has 
8 failed to make 2 or more payments required by an installment payment order in response 
9 to an ex parte motion and affidavit filed by the judgment creditor. The bill proposes to 
10 require a showing that the judgment debtor has failed to timely make 2 or more payments. 
11 The amendment requires the affidavit to describe how payments made by the judgment 
12 debtor, including those received late, have been applied to support the judgment creditor's 
13 motion based on there being at least 2 unpaid installment payments. 
14 This amendment adds language consistent with current law that provides that the 
15 judgment creditor may serve the order on the Department of Labor by ordinary mail and 
16 that the order must be accompanied by a reasonable fee set by the Department of Labor to 
17 cover the costs of processing the request and providing the employment infol111ation. The 
18 Department of Labor must provide the employment information to the judgment creditor 
19 within 20 days after receiving the court order. The fee the Department of Labor may 
20 require to respond to a court order for employment infoll11ation under the existing law is 
21 set by the department; the amendment requires that the fee be calculated by the 
22 department to cover the full labor, overhead and other costs of administering the order 
23 pursuant to state rules and federal regulations. 
24 The amendment adds an appropriations and allocations section.

This legislation expands the circumstances under which the Department of Labor must disclose employment data for 
certain individuals to include small claims court disclosure proceedings and allows for the department to collect a 
reasonable fee for providing the information. 
The department has indicated that the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation will require one Office Associate II 
position to perform the duties necessary to comply with the requirements of this bill. Although the bureau does 
currently have a vacant Office Associate II position, it is federally funded and the duties required by this legislation 
fall outside the scope of work that federal funds can be used for. 
This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $96,489 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $101,189 in fiscal 
year 2016-17 and corresponding Federal EXIJendihlres Fund de allocations to the Employment Security Services 
program within the Department of Labor to transfer and reallocate the cost ofthe vacant Office Associate II position 
from the Federal Expendihlres Fund to Other Special Revenue Funds. This bill also includes Other Special Revenue 
Funds allocations of $15,175 and $15,649 in fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively for the All Other costs. 
This fiscal note assumes that sufficient revenue will be generated from the fees to cover the personal services and all 
other costs of the position. 
The Judicial Department will experience an increase in the workload of District Court Justices and a reduction in 
clerk duties. The net impact is expected to be minor
