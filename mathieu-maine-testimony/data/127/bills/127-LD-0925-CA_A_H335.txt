The bill exempts agricultural producers and home kitchen producers from licensing requirements for the sale of farm 
food products and homemade food, respectively, when their products are sold to informed end consumers and the sale 
occurs at certain locations. These licenses are $20 each and the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 
has indicated that 1,140 of these licenses would no longer be issued. General Fund revenue will be reduced by an 
estimated $17,100 in fiscal year 2015~16 and $22,800 in fiscal year 2016-17 and in every subsequent fiscal year from 
fewer licenses being issued.
