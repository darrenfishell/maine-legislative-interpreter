officer denies an application for certification under this section, the chief law 26 
enforcement officer shall provide the applicant with a written notification of the denial 27

in such prohibition, the court shall order the chief law enforcement officer to issue the 11 
certification and award court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the applicant.  12 
SUMMARY  13 
This bill accomplishes the following.  14 
1.  It removes the prohibition on the use of firearm noise suppression devices when 15 
hunting and provides that a person who is otherwise lawfully hunting may use such 16 
devices.  17 
2.  It establishes a procedure for a person to obtain a chief law enforcement of ficer's 18 
certification under federal law for the approval of an application to transfer or make a 19 
firearm, requires that the certification be provided in a timely fashion unless the applicant 20 
is ineligible, limits the personal information required from the applicant, establishes a 21 
right to an appeal in the case of a denial and clarifies that under the Maine Tort Claims 22 
Act the chief law enforcement officer or an employee of the chief law enforcement 23 
officer making the certification is immune from liability.  24
