127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 503, L.D. 750, Bill, "An Act To Allow 
Regulated Metal Mining in Maine" 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
summary and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 38 MRSA §490-MM, sub-§§3, 7 and 12, as enacted by PL 2011, c. 
653, §23 and affected by §33, are amended to read: 
3. Beneficiation. "Beneficiation" means the treatment of ore to liberate or 
concentrate its valuable constituents. "Beneficiation" includes, but is not limited to, 
crushing, grinding, washing, dissolution, crystallization, filtration, sorting, sizing, drying, 
sintering, pelletizing, briquetting, calcining, roasting in preparation for leaching to 
produce a fmal or intermediate product that does not undergo further beneficiation or 
processing, gravity concentration, magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, flotation, 
ion exchange, solvent extraction, electrowinning, precipitation, amalgamation and dump, 
vat, and tank and ifl: situ leaching. 
7. Heap or percolation leaching. "Heap or percolation leaching" means a process 
for the primary purpose of recovering metallic minerals in an outdoor environment from a 
stockpile of crushed or excavated ore by percolating water or a solution through the ore 
and collecting the leachate. "Heap or percolation leaching" includes in situ leaching. 
12. Mining area. "Mining area" means an area of land described in a permit 
application and approved by the department, including but not limited to land from which 
earth material is removed in connection with mining, the lands land on which material 
from that mining is stored or deposited, the lallds land on which beneficiating or 
treatment facilities, including groundwater and surface water management treatment 
systems, are located Of the lands, land on which water reservoirs impoundments used in a 
mining operation are located, including, but not limited to, water storage ponds, 
sedimentation ponds, retention ponds or leachate collection ponds, or any other land on 
which a single mining operation or mining activity is located. Each mining operation or 
mining activity must have a defmed mining area.

violations of environmental or land use laws administered by the department, the State, 
other states, the United States or another country are required only for those civil 
violations occurring in the 10 years immediately preceding the filing of the request to

financial assurance required for the applicant or permittee; 
15. The rule must be amended in Section 17 to provide that additional fmancial 
assurance is required for a mining operation that includes a tailings impoundment. The 
rule must provide that, as part of the application requirements for a mining operation that 
includes a tailings impoundment, the applicant shall submit the following information: 
information assessing the potential risk for a failure of the tailings impoundment that 
would pose a threat to the public health and safety or the environment; information 
estimating the cost of responding to a failure of the tailings impoundment, including the 
cost of restoring and repairing any damaged public facilities or services and the cost of 
restoring and remediating any damage to the environment resulting from a failure of the 
tailings impoundment; and information projecting the variation over time and, based on 
the size of the tailings impoundment, of the potential costs of a failure of the tailings 
impoundment. The rule must provide for qualified, independent 3rd-party review of the 
application submission materials required for a mining operation that includes a tailings 
impoundment, with the costs of the 3rd-party review to be paid by the applicant. The rule 
must provide that the estimates of the costs of a failure of the tailings impoundment 
provided by the applicant may not include costs to the applicant associated with loss of 
use of the tailings impoundment for operations or the costs of repairing the tailings 
impoundment to restore operations. The rule must require financial assurance in an 
amount determined by the department to be sufficient for the department to respond to, 
restore and remediate any damage to public facilities or services or to the environment 
resulting from the highest cost estimate failure of the tailings impoundment, as based on 
the applicant's cost estimates or as based on information provided by the 3rd-party 
reviewer, and this financial assurance coverage amount must be posted in accordance 
with Section 17 before any tailings may be placed or deposited in the impoundment. The 
rule must provide for administration of this financial assurance in accordance with 
Section 17, including annual adjustment of the financial assurance amount so that the 
amount is sufficient for the department to respond to, restore and remediate any damage 
to public facilities or services or to the environment resulting from the highest cost 
estimate failure of the tailings impoundment in the upcoming year. This rule change 
must be incorporated as necessary in Section 17 and any other affected sections; 
16. The rule must be amended in Section 20(B)(3) to provide that, except as allowed 
under state and federal laws, no mining may be conducted in or on designated lands under 
Title 12, section 598-A, including, but not limited to, the Allagash Wilderness Waterway

SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the majority report of the committee, replaces the bill and 
authorizes final adoption by the Department of Environmental Protection of Chapter 200: 
Metallic Mineral Exploration, Advanced Exploration and Mining, a provisionally adopted 
major substantive rule of the Department of Environmental Protection that was submitted 
to the Legislature for review on January 10, 2014 and that was also submitted to the 
Legislature for review on January 9, 2015 only if a number of specified changes to the 
rule are made. The amendment also provides for a number of corresponding changes to

metallic mineral mining permit applications as described in the Maine Metallic Mineral 
Mining Act. 
The rules implementing the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act, which are 
authorized for final adoption by this amendment, are intended to allow for the 
commercial mining of metallic minerals in the State under a statutory and regulatory 
framework,that addresses risks and protects and prevents damage to the public health and 
safety and the environment and that ensures that the full cost of closure, reclamation and 
post-closure treatment and monitoring of a permitted mining site, as well as the full cost 
of correction and remediation of an accident or failure at a permitted mining site, are paid 
by the permittee and not by the State.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill authorizes final adoption of Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) mining rules if certain changes 
are m~de to the rule. DEP's costs related to making changes to the rule are expected to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources. DEP may incur costs in the future related to approving applicants for a mining 
permit and engaging in certain oversight activities. The extent of costs to DEP will depend on the number of 
applicants and the activities they engage in, but these costs are expected to be covered by mining fees. Applicants are 
required to pay an initial processing fee not to exceed $500,000 and an annual license fee between $20,000 and 
$50,000 that will be directed to the Metallic Mining Fund within DEP. No estimate is made at this time on the number 
of mining applicants. Any additional costs to the Maine Land Use Planning Commission for rulemaking are expected 
to be minor and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. 
If applicants are approved, mining excise tax revenues would be received. The revenue would reimburse 
municipalities and unorganized territories for at least 50%, and if sufficiently available 100%, of the property tax 
revenue loss suffered by that municipality or unorganized territory as a result of property tax exemptions created 
under the mining excise tax statute. 25% of any remaining revenues would be paid to DEP for oversight of mining 
activity and 75% would be deposited to the General Fund. No estimate has been made at this time of the amount of 
mining excise tax revenues that might be generated.
