provided in Title 31, section 1592. The employer, if licensed, certified, registered or 
regulated by any board authorized by Title 5, section 12004-A or whose license may 
be revoked or suspended by proceedings in the District Court or by the Secretary of

registration. This paragraph applies only to cases in which the employer has 
committed a knowing violation, has failed to pay a penalty assessed pursuant to this 
subsection or continues to operate without required coverage after a penalty has been 
assessed pursuant to this subsection. 
For purposes of this subsection, a violation is considered a knowing violation if the 
employer has previously obtained workers' compensation insurance and that insurance 
has been cancelled or that insurance has not been continued or renewed, unless the 
cancellation. failure to continue or nonrenewal is due to a substantial change in the 
employer's operations that is unrelated to the classification of individuals as employees or 
independent contractors; the employer has been notified in writing by the board of the 
need for workers' compensation insurance; the employer has had one or more previous 
violations of the requirement to secure the payment of the compensation provided for by 
this Act; or the employer misclassifies an employee as an independent contractor despite 
a contrary determination by the board. 
Prosecution under paragraph A does not preclude action under paragraph B or C. 
If the employer is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, professional 
corporation or any other legal business entity recognized under the laws of the State, any 
agent of the corporation or legal business entity having primary responsibility for 
obtaining insurance coverage is liable for punishment under this section. Criminal 
liability must be determined in conformity with Title 17-A, sections 60 and 61.'

lines 16 to 19 in L.D.) by striking out the following: "Notwithstanding this section. all

'Sec. 10. Report. By January 15, 2017, the Workers' Compensation Board shall

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
' ;t; 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A"to S.P. 608, L.D. 1553 
The committee may report out a bill relating to the report to the First Regular Session of 
2 the I 28th Legislature.' 
3 Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
4 section number to read consecutively. 
5 SUMMARY 
6 This amendment changes the bill by eliminating the sections affecting independent 
7 contractor predeterminations. The amendment instead requires the Workers' 
8 Compensation Board to study the current system for independent contractor 
9 predeterminations and report any recommended legislation to the joint standing 
10 committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over labor matters. 
11 It also requires the Workers' Compensation Board to consider an employer's efforts to 
12 comply with the coverage requirements of the Maine Workers' Compensation Act of 
13 1992 when imposing a monetary penalty, establishes that criminal prosecution may be 
14 pursued only if the employer has committed a knowing violation and establishes that 
15 revocation of authority to operate pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 39-A, 
16 section 324, subsection 3, paragraph C may be pursued only if the employer has 
17 committed a knowing violation, has failed to pay a penalty assessed pursuant to that 
18 subsection or continues to operate without required workers' compensation insurance 
19 coverage after a penalty has been assessed pursuant to that subsection. Additionally, the 
20 amendment delays the increase to the Workers' Compensation Board assessment cap 
21 from fiscal year 2016-17 to fiscal year 2017-18.
