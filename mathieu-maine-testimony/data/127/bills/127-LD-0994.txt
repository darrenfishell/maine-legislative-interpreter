 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  33 MRSA ยง1603 -116, sub -ยง(k) is enacted to read:  2 
(k) Notwithstanding subsection (b), paragraph (2), a lien under this section securing 3 
priority amounts is prior to a first mortgage. The association's failure to send notice to the 4 
first mortgagee either that the owner of the unit is 60 days delinquent in the payment of 5 
common expenses or that the association intends to file an action to enforce the lien 6 
within 30 days does not affect the p riority of the lien securing the 6 months of regular 7 
assessments, but failure to send at least one notice means that the association is not 8 
entitled to receive any costs or attorney's fees incurred in an action to enforce the lien. 9 
The full payment of the priority amounts discharges the lien under this section.  As used 10 
in this subsection, "priority amounts" means the amount of the association's regular 11 
assessments established under a periodic budget that would have become due during the 12 
6-month period imme diately prior to initiating a lawsuit to enforce a lien under this 13 
section and the association's costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in enforcing the 14 
lien. "Priority amounts" does not include amounts attributable to special assessments, late 15 
charges, fines, penalties and interest assessed by the association.  16 
SUMMARY  17 
This bill establishes a 6 -month lien for condominium association assessments that 18 
takes priority over a first mortgage.  19
