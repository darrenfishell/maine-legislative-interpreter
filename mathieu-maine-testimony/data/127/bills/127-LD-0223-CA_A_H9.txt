SUMMARY 
Current law provides that the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 153, 
subchapter 1 relating to bids and contracts for public improvement projects does not 
apply to contracts for transportation-related services and contracts for construction and 
maintenance that, by law, are under the supervision of the Department of Transportation. 
This amendment clarifies that Title 5, chapter 153, subchapter 1 also does not apply to 
contracts for transportation-related services and contracts for construction and 
maintenance that, by law, are under the supervision of the Maine Turnpike Authority.
