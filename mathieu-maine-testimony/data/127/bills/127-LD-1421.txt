SUMMARY  8 
Under the federal Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, also known as the 9 
"ABLE Act," individuals with disabilities and the families of those individuals may 10 
establish federal tax exem pt savings accounts and use the funds from those accounts to 11 
pay for the care of the individual with a disability, similar to so -called 529 accounts that 12 
allow tax -deferred savings for college expenses.  13 
This bill establishes the ABLE ME Savings Program, ba sed on the federal Act, to 14 
allow individuals with disabilities who are residents of Maine or their families to 15 
establish savings accounts to be used for qualified disability expenses.  Contributions 16 
made to the accounts are tax -deferred; withdrawals for qu alified disability expenses, as 17 
well as the earnings of the account, are tax exempt.  The program is administered by the 18 
Treasurer of State in compliance with the federal Act.  The Treasurer of State is 19 
authorized to contract with financial organizations t o serve as depositories or managers of 20 
the program.  21 
The program is open to an individual who is blind or disabled and whose blindness or 22 
disability occurred before the date on which the individual attained 26 years of age and to 23 
an individual who filed a d isability certification to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the 24 
Treasury of the United States.  Qualified disability expenses are defined in federal law 25 
and include expenses on behalf of a qualified individual for education, housing, 26 
transportation, em ployment training and support, assistive technology and personal 27 
support services and legal fees.  28 
The Treasurer of State is required to establish, impose and collect fees for the 29 
administration of the program.  These fees may be imposed on a depository or program 30 
manager contracted with by the treasurer and, pursuant to the contract between the 31 
treasurer and the depository or program manager, on the account holders for the 32 
maintenance of the accounts.  The fees collected by the treasurer must be used for th e 33 
administrative expenses of the treasurer.  34
