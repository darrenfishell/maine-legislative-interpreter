(c) of the federal Food Stamp Act of 1977 and the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 8

in benefits as defined by 7 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 271.2 commits a Class D 14 
crime . and is subject to the following:  15 
A.  For a first offense, the benefits under this section are suspended for one year;  16 
B.  For a 2nd or subsequent offense, the be nefits under this section are suspended for 17 
at least 5 years; and  18

electronic benefits transfer card in exchange for an unlawful substance under Title 20 
17-A, chapter 45, the penalty under that paragraph is doubled.  21 
Sec. 2.  22 MRSA §3104, sub -§§15 and 16 are enacted to read:  22

benefits transfer card issued to a recipient must have a photograph of the r ecipient on the 24 
card.  25 
16.  Notification letter.  The department shall send a letter to all recipients of 26 
benefits under this section notifying the recipients of the provisions of subsection 12.  27 
Every recipient of benefits under this section must sign the notification letter 28 
acknowledging that the recipient understands the letter's contents and return the letter to 29 
the department within a reasonable period of time as determined by the department.  30

 2.  If an electronic benefits transfer card is found in the possession of a person other 1 
than the recipient and the person is arrested and charged for a drug offense, it creates a 2 
rebuttable presumption that the recipient trafficked the card for drugs;  3 
3.  A replacement electronic benefits transfer card must have a photograph of the 4 
recipient on the card; and  5 
4.  The Department of Health and Human Services is directed to send a letter  to all 6

penalty provision.  The recipient is required to sign and return the letter acknowledging 8 
the recipient understood the letter.  9
