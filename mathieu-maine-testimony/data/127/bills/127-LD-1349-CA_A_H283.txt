Fiscal Note 
Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This bill creates the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services to be 
operated and funded independently of the department. The bill does not provide or identify a source of funding for the 
newly created office. The bill assumes the new office will take over functions of existing Department of Health and 
Human Services offices including the Division of Audit and possibly some of the functions of the Department of the 
Attorney General. Transferring these functions may allow for the transfer of some existing funds to the new office but 
would also likely require the appropriation and allocation of additional funds. The amount of funding required for the 
new office cannot be determined at this time. 
This fiscal note further assumes additional costs to the Legislature's Office of Program Evaluation and Government 
Accountability to conduct an audit of the Inspector General upon complaint or on an as-needed basis will be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources.
