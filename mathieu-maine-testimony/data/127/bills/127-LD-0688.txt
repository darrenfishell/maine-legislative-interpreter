SUMMARY  9 
This bill makes the following changes to the laws relating to the Bolduc Correctional 10 
Facilit y: 11 
1.  It repeals the statutory provision relating to the Maine State Prison minimum 12 
security unit.  Because the Bolduc Correctional Facility was established in law in Public 13 
Law 2013, chapter 508, this provision is now superfluous.  14 
2.  It specifies that e mployees of the Bolduc Correctional Facility have the same 15 
power to search for and apprehend escapees as the employees of the other Department of 16 
Corrections facilities have.  17
