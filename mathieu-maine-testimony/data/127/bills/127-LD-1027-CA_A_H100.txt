9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 'A " to H.P. 710, L.D. 1027, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Create an Elver Exporter's License" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
12 following: 
13 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
14 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
15 Whereas, exporters of elvers caught in the State are not currently required to hold a 
16 license to do so; and 
17 Whereas, the lack of an elver exporter's license provides opportunity for the 
18 transport of elvers that may have been caught in violation of state law, and the high value 
19 of elvers provides an incentive to engage in this practice; and 
20 Whereas, the requirement that elver exporters hold an elver exporter's license will 
21 improve the ability of the Department of Marine Resources to better enforce all elver 
22 fishing laws; and 
23 Whereas, this legislation must take effect before the expiration of the 90-day period 
24 in order to take effect before the end of the elver fishing season; and 
25 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
26 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
27 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
28 therefore,'

SUMMARY 
This amendment eliminates the requirement that the Department of Marine Resources 
issue an elver dealer transaction card to the holder of an elver exporter's license and 
instead provides that the department must issue an electronic recording device that 
records the information on an elver dealer transaction card. It also adds an emergency 
preamble and clause to the bill.

The bill establishes an elver exporter's license costing $5,000 each and allows someone to buy elvers from certain 
license holders and transport them beyond the state limits. This will increase Other Special Revenue Funds revenue to 
the Eel and Elver Management Fund within the Department of Marine Resources by an estimated $30,000 in fiscal 
year 2014-15 and in every subsequent fiscal year.
