9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to S.P. 568, L.D. 1470, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend Maine's Death Certificate Disclosure Law" 
11 Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 5 (page 1, lines 4 to 24 in 
12 L.D.) and inserting the following: 
13 '5. Records disclosed. Certified or noncertified copies of vital records of a person 
14 must be made available at any reasonable time upon that person's request or the request of 
15 that person's spouse, registered domestic partner, descendant, parent or guardian, 
16 grandparent, sibling, stepparent, stepchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, 
17 father-in-law, personal representative or that person's duly designated attorney or agent or 
18 attorney for an agent designated by that person or by a court having jurisdiction over that 
19 person whether the request be made in person, by mail, by telephone or otherwise, if the 
20 state registrar is satisfied as to the identity of the requester and, if an attorney or agent, if 
21 the state registrar is satisfied as to the attorney's or agent's authority to act as that person's 
22 agent or attorney. If the agent or attorney has been appointed by a court of competent 
23 jurisdiction, or the attorney's or agent's appearance for the person is entered therein, the 
24 state registrar shall upon request so ascertain by telephone call to the register, clerk or 
25 recorder of the court, and this must be deemed sufficient justification to compel 
26 compliance with the request for the record. Certified or noncertified copies of the death 
27 certificate of a minor's parent must be made available at any reasonable time upon the 
28 request of that minor's living parent, as defined in Title 19-A, section 1832, subsection 
29 13, if the requester's parental rights with respect to that minor have not been terminated 
30 and the state registrar is satisfied as to the identity of the requester. The state registrar 
31 shall, as soon as possible, designate persons in the Office of Data, Research and Vital 
32 Statistics who may act in the state registrar's absence or, in case of the state registrar's 
33 disqualification, to carry out the intent of this subsection. A record of birth, death, fetal 
34 death, marriage, divorce or domestic partner registration may be disclosed as necessary 
35 for the department to carry out its responsibilities.'
