D. It appears to be in the best interest of the State to negotiate for the procurement of 
energy-related commodities, such as petroleum products, natural gas and electricity; 
Sec. 5. 5 MRSA §1825-B, sub-§2, ,G, as amended by PL 1999, c. 105, §3, is 
further amended to read: 
G. The procurement of goods or services involves expenditures of $10,000 $25,000 
or less, and procurement from a single source is the most economical, effective and 
appropriate means of fulfilling a demonstrated need. 
Sec. 6. 5 MRSA §1825-B, sub-§§7 and 8, as amended by PL 2015, c. 179, §2, 
are further amended to read: 
7. Awards to best-value bidder. Except as otherwise provided by law, 
competitively awarded orders, grants or contracts made by the Director of the Bureau of 
General Services or by any department or agency of the State must be awarded to the 
best-value bidder, taking into consideration the qualities of the goods or services to be 
supplied, their conformity with the specifications, the purposes for which they are 
required, the date of delivery and the best interest of the State or any criteria identified 
within the State's competitive bidding documents for any given purchase. If the bidder 
that was initially awarded the order, grant or contract does not perform, the Director of 
the Bureau of General Services may cancel the order, grant or contract and award a new 
order, grant or contract to the 2nd best-value bidder. The order, grant or contract may not 
be awarded to a bidder that the Director of the Bureau of General Services determined 
was not in compliance at the time the initial bid was submitted. 
8. Tie bids. The Director of the Bureau of General Services shall award contracts, 
grants or purchases to in-state bidders or to bidders rendering services or offering 
commodities produced or manufactured in the State if the price, quality, availability and 
other factors are equivalent. If a tie cannot be resolved based on whether one bidder is an 
in-state bidder or a bidder who renders services or offers commodities produced or 
manufactured in the State, the director may contact the tied bidders and invite them to 
submit new cost proposals. The bidder with the lowest cost proposal must be awarded the 
contract, unless the director decides not to make an award to any bidder. 
Sec. 7. 5 MRSA §1825-D, sub-§2, as enacted by PL 1989, c. 785, §2, is amended 
to read:

requirement that written records of the evaluation of bids be kept hv easl:i He.-sofl clfresth1

SUMMARY 
This amendment is the minority report and strikes and replaces the bill. It changes the 
title and amends Maine's procurement laws instead of, as in the bill, establishing a 
framework for governmental entities to enter into agreements with private entities and 
persons to develop or operate qualifying projects. 
It expands the description of what can be purchased cooperatively by the State for 
other public entities. It adds "goods" and "commodities" to the list of terms under the 
scope of the purchasing authority of the Department of Administrative and Financial

1 Services, Bureau of General Services. It replaces the term "services" with "labor, time or 
2 effort" by a contractor or vendor and removes the definition of "services." It provides that 
3 the Director of the Bureau of General Services may enter into or participate in multistate 
4 agreements when it is in the best interests of the State. The director may also enter into or 
5 participate in competitively awarded agreements from the United States Government, 
6 other state and local governments or other public entities when the competitive process is 
7 similar to the State's. 
8 The amendment updates language in regard to specific reasons under which a waiver 
9 of competition can be granted by the bureau. The language provides consistency and 
10 updates current practices to better reflect current markets, including the addition of 
11 natural gas and electricity. It also increases from $10,000 or less to $25,000 or less the 
12 amount of expenditures under which the director may waive competitive bidding if 
13 procurement from a single source is the most economical, effective and appropriate. 
14 The amendment expands what the bureau must take into consideration when 
15 determining the best-value bidder for any goods or services to be consistent with 
16 competitive bidding documents. It clarifies how to remedy tie bids. 
17 The amendment provides that rules of the State Purchasing Agent that govern the 
18 procedure for reviewing competitive bids include the requirement that written records of 
19 the evaluation of bids be kept.
