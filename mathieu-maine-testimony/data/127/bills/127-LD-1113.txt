 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
CONCEPT DRAFT  2 
SUMMARY  3 
This bill is a concept draft pursuant to Joint Rule 208.  4 
This bill proposes to amend the standards for preconviction release by eliminating 5 
cash bail and requiring a judge or justice when making bail determinations to consider 6 
validated risk assessment tools.  The purpose of this bill is to shift the emphasis from cash 7 
to suitability for release based on risk, in order to ensure the defendant's appearance in 8 
court and to pre vent the defendant from committing new crimes.  9
