 SUMMARY  1 
This bill repeals the service provider tax on private nonmedical institutions and 2 
expands the tax to cover motion picture entertainment and certain winter sports. Th e 3 
revenue from the newly covered services is dedicated to fund medical services eligible 4 
for matching federal Medicaid funding currently funded by revenue from the tax on 5 
private nonmedical institutions. The bill also corrects an oversight by identifying t he 6 
application of revenue from the service provider tax on group residential services for 7 
persons with brain injuries.  8
