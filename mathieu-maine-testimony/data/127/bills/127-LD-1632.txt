read:  35 
1.  Legislative intent and findings.   The Legislature finds that there is citizen 36 
dissatisfaction with plea bargaining which  that has resulted in some criticism of the 37 
criminal justice process.  The Legislature further finds that part of the dissatisfaction is 38 
caused because victims of crimes and law enforcement officers who respond to those 39 
crimes have no subsequent contact with the cases as they proceed through the cou rts for 40 
judicial disposition. Victims and law enforcement officers are many times not informed 41 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR2650(01) -1 
 by prosecutors of plea agreements which  that are to be submitted to the court for approval 1 
or rejection under existing Maine Rules of Unified  Criminal Procedure.   It is the intent of 2 
this section to alleviate these expressions of citizen dissatisfaction and to promote greater 3 
understanding by prosecutors of citizens' valid concerns. This is most likely to be 4 
accomplished by citizens and law enforcement officers be ing informed of the results of 5 
plea negotiations before they are submitted to the courts.  This notification will in no way 6 
affect the authority of the judge  court  to accept, reject or modify the terms of the plea 7 
agreement.  8

 Page 9 - 127LR2650(01) -1 
  (4)  The DNA test results and other evidence admitted  at the hearing conducted 1 
under this section on behalf of the person are material to the issue as to who is 2 
responsible for the crime for which the person was convicted; and  3

SUMMARY  21 
This bill implements the reco mmendations of the Criminal Law Advisory 22 
Commission and makes the following changes to the Maine Revised Statutes.  23 
1.  It replaces all references and citations to the former Maine Rules of Criminal 24 
Procedure with references and citations to the new Maine R ules of Unified Criminal 25 
Procedure.  26 
2.  It repeals, amends or enacts provisions to provide that the Superior Court will no 27 
longer be called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to hear appeals and petitions from the 28 
District Court.  29 
3.  It removes the referenc e to Rule 42 of the Maine Rules of Criminal Procedure in 30 
the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 14, section 3142, subsection 3.  31 
4.  It replaces the word "judge" with the word "court" in certain provisions in Title 15 32 
and Title 17 -A because modern usage does not  employ the word "judge" to refer 33 
simultaneously to both a justice and a judge.  Instead, the word "court" is employed.  34 
5.  It removes references to Rule 16 of the Maine Rules of Criminal Procedure in 35 
certain provisions in Title 15 and Title 17 -A. 36 
6.  It a mends certain provisions in Title 15 to enhance clarity and consistency.  37
