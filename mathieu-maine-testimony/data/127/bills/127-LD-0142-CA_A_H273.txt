FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 100, L.D. 
Expand Deer Hunting Opportunities for Junior Hunters" 142, Bill, "An Act To 
11 Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 5-A (page 1, lines 3 to 12 
12 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
13 '5-A. Permit transfer to junior hunter. Notwithstanding subsection 5, a junior 
14 hunter may take an antlerless deer if another person who is 18 years of age or older and 
15 holds a valid antlerless deer permit transfers that permit to that junior hunter by 
16 identifying the name and address of the transferee on the permit as well as any other 
17 information reasonably requested by the commissioner and then returns the permit tothe 
18 department at least 48 hours prior to the junior hunter's hunting antlerless deer. Upon 
19 transfer of the antlerless deer permit to a iunior hunter, the transferor may not hunt an 
20 antlerless deer pursuant to the transferred permit but remains eligible, unless otherwise 
21 prohibited, to take a deer other than an antlerless deer in accordance with this Part. 
22 The commissioner shall record a transfer under this subsection and return the permit to 
23 the transferee. A valid permit must be in the possession of the transferee in order for the 
24 transferee to take an antlerless deer.' 
25 SUMMARY 
26 This amendment replaces the bill. It provides that an antlerless deer permit holder 
27 who is 18 years of age or older may transfer the antlerless deer permit to a person who 
28 holds a junior hunting license at least 48 hours prior to the time the person holding the 
29 junior hunting license hunts for antlerless deer. Once the antlerless deer permit is 
30 transferred, the transferor loses the right to take an antlerless deer under that permit but 
31 remains eligible, unless otherwise prohibited, to take an antlered deer in accordance with 
32 the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 12, Part 13.
