3.  Best interest of child; presumption of shared parenting.   The court, in making 19

C.  The preference of the child, if old enough to express a meaningful preference;  29 
D.  The duration and adequacy of the child's current living arrangements and the 30 
desirability of maintaining  continuity;  31 
E.  The stability of any proposed living arrangements for the child;  32

affection and guidance;  34

L.  The existence of domestic abuse between t he parents, in the past or currently, and 4 
how that abuse affects:  5 
(1)  The child emotionally;  6

considered if established by clear and convincing evidence, and if it is furt her found 16 
by clear and convincing evidence that in the particular circumstances of the parents 17 
and child, that willful misuse tends to show that the acting parent will in the future 18 
have a lessened ability and willingness to cooperate and work with the oth er parent in 19 
their shared responsibilities for the child.  The court shall articulate findings of fact 20 
whenever relying upon this factor as part of its determination of a child's best interest.  21 
The voluntary dismissal of a protection from abuse petition m ay not, taken alone, be 22 
treated as evidence of the willful misuse of the protection from abuse process;  23 
P.  If the child is under one year of age, whether the child is being breast -fed; 24 
Q.  The existence of a parent's conviction for a sex offense or a sexu ally violent 25 
offense as those terms are defined in Title 34 -A, section 11203;  26 
R.  If there is a person residing with a parent, whether that person:  27 
(1)  Has been convicted of a crime under Title 17 -A, chapter 11 or 12 or a 28 
comparable crime in another juri sdiction;  29 
(2)  Has been adjudicated of a juvenile offense that, if the person had been an 30 
adult at the time of the offense, would have been a violation of Title 17 -A, 31 
chapter 11 or 12; or  32 
(3)  Has been adjudicated in a proceeding, in which the person was a  party, under 33 
Title 22, chapter 1071 as having committed a sexual offense; and  34 
S.  Whether allocation of some or all parental rights and responsibilities would best 35
