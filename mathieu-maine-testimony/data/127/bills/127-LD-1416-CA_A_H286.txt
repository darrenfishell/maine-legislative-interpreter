127TH LEGISLATURE 
FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "Pr" to H.P. 962, L.D. 1416, Bill, "An Act 
Regarding Interstate Shellfish Depuration" 
Amend the bill in the emergency preamble by striking out all of the 3rd, 4th and 5th 
paragraphs (page 1, lines 5 to 11 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'Whereas, interstate transfer of shellfish may occur only by formal agreement 
between states and in compliance with the National Shellfish Sanitation Program; and 
Whereas, shellfish depuration may currently be performed at a facility that is not 
listed on the Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List; and' 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of ยง6104 (page 1, lines 20 to 25 in 
L.D.) and inserting the following: 
'ยง6104. Shellfish depuration; memorandum of agreement 
If the commissioner enters into a memorandum of agreement regarding interstate 
transport of shellfish for depuration pursuant to the National Shellfish Sanitation 
Program. the agreement must provide that depuration of shellfish may occur only in a 
facility listed for depuration on the Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies references in the bill to the National Shellfish Sanitation 
Program and facilities where depuration of shellfish may occur. The amendment also 
removes the requirement that a memorandum of agreement regarding interstate transport 
of shellfish for depuration be reciprocal among the states involved.
