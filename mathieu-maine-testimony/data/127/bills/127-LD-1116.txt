CHAPTER 42  2 
THORIUM ENERGY  3 
§4201.  Definitions  4 
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following terms 5 
have the following meanings.  6 
1.  Liquid fluoride thorium reactor .   "Liquid fluoride thorium reactor" means a 7 
thermal breeder reactor that uses thorium and fluoride -based liquid salt as fuel.  8 
2.  Thorium refinery.  "Thorium refinery" means a facility that removes thorium 9 
from other elements.  10 
§4202.  Permitting  11 
1.  Thor ium refinery permit.  A person may operate a thorium refinery in this State 12 
if the person obtains a permit from the commission under this subsection and complies 13 
with all other applicable state and local siting or regulatory requirements.  The 14 
commission s hall issue a permit to operate a thorium refinery in this State if the 15 
commission finds that the thorium produced by the refinery will be used or consumed 16 
within the State.  17 
2.  Liquid fluoride thorium reactor.  A person may operate a liquid fluoride 18 
thoriu m reactor in this State if the person obtains a permit from the commission under 19 
this subsection and complies with all other applicable state and local siting or regulatory 20 
requirements.  The commission shall issue a permit to operate a liquid fluoride tho rium 21 
reactor in this State if the commission finds that the thorium used by the facility will be 22 
produced within the State.  23 
SUMMARY  24 
This bill authorizes the Public Utilities Commission to issue permits for the operation 25 
of a thorium refinery or a liquid fl uoride thorium reactor in this State and provides that 26 
energy produced by a liquid thorium reactor qualifies as a renewable resource and as a 27 
renewable capacity resource under the renewable portfolio requirements.  28
