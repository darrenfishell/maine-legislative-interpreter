12 following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 22 MRSA ยง4301, sub-ยงl-B is enacted to read: 
14 1-B. Available resource. "Available resource" means any resource that is 
15 immediately available or can be secured without delay, including but not limited to cash 
16 on hand or in bank accounts; support from relatives; any state, federal or nonprofit health 
17 or social service provider assistance; or any housing, employment or unemployment 
18 assistance that an applicant is receiving or is immediately eligible to receive.' 
19 Amend the bill by striking out all of section 4 and inserting the following: 
20 'Sec. 4. 22 MRSA ยง4317-A is enacted to read: 
21 ยง4317-A. Use of available resources 
22 1. Abandonment and refusal to use available resource. An applicant who 
23 abandons or refuses to use an available resource without just cause is not eligible to 
24 receive general assistance to replace the abandoned or refused available resource for a 
25 period of 120 days from the date the applicant abandoned or refused to use the available 
26 resource. An available resource is considered abandoned if the applicant without just 
27 cause voluntarily terminates receipt of an available resource. It is the responsibility of the 
28 applicant to establish the presence of just cause. 
29 2. Forfeiture of benefits. An applicant who forfeits receipt of or causes reduction in 
30 benefits from an available resource because of fraud, misrepresentation or a knowing or 
31 intentional violation of a rule governing an available resource or a refusal to comply with 
32 a rule governing an available resource without just cause is not eligible to receive general 
33 assistance to replace the forfeited benefits for the duration of a sanction imposed on the 
34 applicant for violation of a rule governing an available resource or 120 days, whichever is 
35 greater. It is the responsibility of the applicant to establish the presence of just cause.

13 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" Pc" to S.P. 362, L.D. 1036 
Failure of an otherwise eligible person to comply with this section may not affect the 
general assistance eligibility of any member of the person's household.' 
Amend the amendment by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter 
or section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, retains from the bill 
a definition for "available resource" but moves it to the general definition section for the 
chapter of law relating to municipal general assistance. The amendment also removes the 
provision in the bill that identifies circumstances relating to the use of an available 
resource under which just cause must be found, relying instead on the definition of "just 
cause" in the general definition section.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This bill may produce savings to the Department of Health and Human services. However, since General Assistance is 
administered by municipalities, DHHS does not have client specific data to determine if the sanction period or 120 
days is greater. Also, DHHS is unable to determine which clients return to seek General Assistance benefits once the 
disqualification period has ended.
