This amendment reduces the increase in the required minimum wage proposed in the initiated bill from $9.00 per 
hour to $8.50 per hour effective January 1, 2017; from $10.00 per hour to $9.00 per hour effective January 1, 2018; 
from $11.50 per hour to $9.50 per hour effective January 1, 2019 and from $12.00 per hour to $10.00 per hour 
effective January 1, 2020. This amendment also removes the inflation adjustment requirement in subsequent years 
and eliminates the change in the tip credit. 
The 4-step increase in the minimum wage proposed in this amendment may not increase salary costs to the State until 
the $10.00 per hour rate begins on January 1, 2020. The future State Government impact of the changes to the 
minimum wage will depend on the salary schedules in place at the time the increases occur and cannot be estimated 
at this time. 
The Bureau of Labor Standards within the Maine Department of Labor will still require General Fund appropriations 
of $16,500 per year for each of the 4 years that the minimum wage is increased. Of this annual amount, $3,500 per 
year would be for updating the minimum wage poster and other related publications, $5,000 would be for postage 
costs to distribute the updated poster and publications and $8,000 would be for travel costs associated with 
compliance, education and outreach.
