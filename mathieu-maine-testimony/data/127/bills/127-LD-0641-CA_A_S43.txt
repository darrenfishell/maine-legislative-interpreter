Nov-15 General Referendum Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $1 07,250 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill proposes to amend the Constitution of Maine to have exactly 32 State Senators and give the voters of each 
county the right to vote for 2 State Senators. If this amendment to the Constitution of Maine is approved, the 
Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices (Commission) would incur increased costs in 
administering the Maine Clean Election Act (MCEA) due to an estimated increase in the number of contested 
primaries. The Commission also expects revenue from increased qualifying contributions to increase by $2,625 in 
fiscal year 2015-16 and $3,500 in fiscal year 2017-18. The Commission anticipates the need for Other Special 
Revenue Funds allocations of $217,086 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $306,836 in fiscal year 2017-18 for these increased 
MCEA costs. The Commission has indicated that it has sufficient resources available to fund these allocations. 
If this amendment to the Constitution of Maine is approved the Legislature would realize savings from a reduction in 
the number of Senators from 35 to 32. These savings are estimated to be $111,139 in fiscal year 2016-17 and $92,568 
in fiscal year 2017-18.
