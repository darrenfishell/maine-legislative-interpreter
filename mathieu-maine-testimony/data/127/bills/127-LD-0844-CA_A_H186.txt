SUMMARY 
This amendment removes representatives of the Department of Labor, the 
Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Economic and 
Community Development from the Public Transit Advisory Council, which the bill 
creates. The bill requires the council to make recommendations for the optimal 
coordination of transit services with other senior and veteran services provided by the 
Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services. The 
amendment requires the council to make recommendations for the optimal coordination 
of transit services with other senior and veteran services generally, without reference to 
those services provided by the departments. 
It also removes the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human 
Services from the list of entities the Department of Transportation must consult with 
when designating regional public transportation agencies, approving locally coordinated 
plans for regional transit and coordinating purchase of service contracts.
