The amendment retains the provisions of the bill regarding how abandonment is 
determined and allowing municipalities to recover their cost of maintaining abandoned 
properties through the application of a supplemental tax on the property. The amendment 
gives responsible parties 30 days from the date a permit is issued to correct identified 
property defects before the municipality will take corrective action if a permit is 
necessary. The definition of "responsible parties" is limited to record owners, and the 
daily fine against mortgagees and mortgagors for nonmaintenance as proposed in the bill 
has been removed. The amendment also requires lenders to notify municipalities of the 
initiation of a foreclosure proceeding and to provide an in-state representative to respond 
to municipal inquiries.
