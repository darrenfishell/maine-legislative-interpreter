SUMMARY  24 
This bill contains recommendations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 25 
included in its ninth annual report.  26 
Part A adds one additional member to the Right To Know Advisory Committee, to be 27 
appointed by the Go vernor.  The new position will bring information technology 28 
expertise to the advisory committee.  29 
Current law requires the Public Access Ombudsman within the Department of the 30 
Attorney General to submit an annual report to the Right To Know Advisory Committ ee 31 
and the Legislature by March 15th of each year.  Part B changes the reporting date to 32 
January 15th of each year, which is the same date by which the Right To Know Advisory 33 
Committee is required to submit its annual report.  34 
 
 Page 8 - 127LR1905(01) -1 
 Part C implements the recommen dations of the Right To Know Advisory Committee 1 
relating to existing public records exceptions in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 22 and 2 
Titles 26 to 39 -A. 3 
Section 1 repeals the Community Right -to-Know Act, a program within the 4 
Department of Health and H uman Services intended to provide disclosure of information 5 
about hazardous substances in the community that has never been implemented.  6 
Section 2 makes clear that reports of final bureau action are public records, removing 7 
the language in current law that  gives the Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards the 8 
discretion to release reports.  9 
Section 3 clarifies that a report of the State Board of Arbitration and Conciliation in a 10 
labor dispute must be released 15 days after its receipt by the Governor and E xecutive 11 
Director of the Maine Labor Relations Board if the conciliation process is not successful.  12 
Section 4 removes language authorizing the Secretary of State to adopt rules relating 13 
to maintenance and use of data processing files concerning motor vehic les as the 14 
confidentiality of personal information is already protected under federal law.  15 
Section 5 repeals a provision of law relating to the Secretary of State's motor vehicle 16 
information technology system because the confidentiality of the system is al ready 17 
addressed in another provision of law.  18 
Section 6 removes language that is addressed in another section of law.  19 
Section 7 clarifies that it is the responsibility of the providers of telecommunications 20 
relay services to keep relay service communication s confidential.  21 
Section 8 adds a cross -reference to the definition of "trade secret."  22 
Section 9 removes language making mercury reduction plans for air emission sources 23 
emitting mercury confidential.  24 
Section 10 repeals a provision of law making hazardous a ir pollutant emissions 25 
inventory information confidential, and section 11 corrects a cross -reference to that 26 
provision.  27 
Part D repeals the public records exceptions review schedule that was completed in 28 
2014 and replaces it with a new review schedule.  The  Right To Know Advisory 29 
Committee will review public records exceptions enacted after 2004 but before 2013 and 30 
report its recommendations to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 31 
jurisdiction over judiciary matters over the course of 2 yea rs, with the final review by the 32 
joint standing committee completed no later than 2017.  The advisory committee will 33 
then begin to review all the public records exceptions codified in the statutes over a 12 - 34 
year period.  35
