This bill includes ongoing Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) allocations of $400,000 per year beginning in fiscal 
year 2016-17 to the newly created Animal and Plant Disease and Ticks and Other Insects Management Fund at the 
University of Maine Cooperative Extension for pest management and pesticide safety outreach and education and for 
testing of ticks provided by the public and certain other laboratory operations at the University of Maine Cooperative 
Extension's animal and plant disease and insect control laboratory. 
The bill requires the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) to transfer $400,000 from the 
Board of Pesticides Control Fund (Pesticides Fund) in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Animal and Plant Disease and Ticks 
and Other Insects Management Fund at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. The Pesticides Fund has 
sufficient resources to make this one-time transfer. This bill also requires ACF to transfer $400,000 annually 
beginning in fiscal year 2017-18 to this new account from available balances in various OSRF accounts within ACF 
or other sources available to ACF. ACF is expected to have sufficient resources in all of its OSRF accounts to make 
these yearly transfers in the foreseeable future. However, ACF has indicated that it will only make these transfers 
from the Pesticides Fund, but the Pesticides Fund does not have sufficient resources to make these annual transfers in 
perpetuity. The language in the bill gives ACF the authority to determine which account balances to draw from, but 
does not anticipate that ACF will only draw from the Pesticides Fund.
