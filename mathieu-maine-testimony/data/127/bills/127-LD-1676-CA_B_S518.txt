8 SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT " 5,, to S.P. 689, L.D. 1676, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Establish a Process for Procurement of Renewable Resources" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
12 'An Act To Establish a Process for the Procurement of Biomass Resources' 
13 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
14 summary and inserting the following: 
15 'Sec. 1. Biomass competitive solicitation. 
16 1. Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
17 following terms have the following meanings. 
18 A. "Biomass resource" is a source of electrical generation fueled by wood, wood 
19 waste or landfill gas that produces energy that may be physically delivered to the 
20 ISO-NE region, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 1902, 
21 subsection 3, or in the NMISA region. 
22 B. "Commission" means the Public Utilities Commission. 
23 C. "NMISA region" is the area administered by the independent system 
24 administrator for northern Maine or any successor of the independent system 
25 administrator for northern Maine. 
26 2. Solicitation and contract negotiation. In accordance with subsection 3, the 
27 commission shall initiate a competitive solicitation as soon as practicable and direct 
28 investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities to enter into one or more 2-year 
29 contracts for up to 80 megawatts of biomass resources contingent upon available funds 
30 for above-market costs of the contract pursuant to subsection 4. The contract may be a 
31 contract for energy or a contract for differences. If a generator offers to sell capacity or 
32 renewable energy attributes as part of a contract entered into pursuant to this section, the 
33 contract may include the purchase of such capacity or attributes, but the commission may 
34 not condition any solicitation or contract on an offer or sale of capacity or renewable 
35 energy attributes.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "\3 "to S.P. 689, L.D. 1676 
1 3. Review and selection of renewable resources and contract adjustments. In 
2 conducting a solicitation and entering into any contract under subsection 2, the 
3 commission shall: 
4 A. Ensure that a biomass resource facility is operating at 50% capacity 6 months 
5 prior to the initiation of a competitive solicitation in accordance with subsection 2 
6 and continues to operate at that capacity except for planned and forced outages; and 
7 B. Seek to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that a contract entered into under 
8 this section: 
9 (1) Provides benefits to ratepayers; 
10 (2) Provides in-state benefits, such as capital investments to improve long-term 
11 viability of the facility, permanent direct jobs, payments to municipalities, 
12 payments for fuel harvested in the State, payment for in-state resource access, in-
13 state purchases of goods and services and construction-related jobs and 
14 purchases; 
15 (3) Reduces greenhouse gas emissions; 
16 (4) Promotes fuel diversity; and 
17 (5) Supports or improves grid reliability. 
18 In selecting among bids, the commission shall determine the total in-state economic 
19 benefits of the contract in an expected annual dollar per megawatt-hour average and the 
20 cost to fund the above-market costs of a contract in an expected annual dollar per 
21 megawatt-hour average. The commission shall consider both of these values for each 
22 proposal to identify those proposals that maximize the overall benefits to the State, and 
23 shall establish a process under which a generator of biomass resources verifies on an 
24 annual basis that the projected in-state economic benefits are generated during the term of 
25 the contract. If the commission finds the in-state benefits are not being achieved, the 
26 commission may reduce the contract payment by the percentage difference between 
27 actual in-state benefits achieved and the projected in-state benefits. 
28 4. Cost limits. The commission may enter only into contracts under this section that 
29 are contingent on the availability of funds in the cost recovery fund established under 
30 subsection 5 to pay the above-market costs of the contract, as determined by the 
31 commission. Payments of all above-market costs of a contract must be made solely from 
32 those funds and are not a liability of the transmission and distribution utility, its 
33 ratepayers or the commission. If insufficient funds are available in the fund to pay above-
34 market costs under a contract, the commission shall notify the contracting entity and, 
35 unless the contracting entity and the commission agree otherwise, the contract is 
36 suspended. The commission and the contracting entity may agree to reinstate a 
37 suspended contract upon the availability of sufficient funds in the cost recovery fund to 
38 pay above-market costs. 
39 5. Cost recovery fund. There is established within the commission a nonlapsing 
40 cost recovery fund, referred to in this section as "the fund." The fund receives funds 
41 allocated or transferred by the Legislature from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund in 
42 accordance with subsection 8. The commission shall use the fund to pay all above-
43 market costs of any contract entered into under this section. The commission by rule or

the contract between the contract price and the prevailing market price at which the 
capacity resource is sold or any gains or losses derived from a contract for differences 
must be reflected in the amounts charged to ratepayers and may not be considered 
imprudent.

under this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375,

The bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to enter into one or more two-year contracts for up to 80 
megawatts of biomass resources, contingent upon available funds for above market costs of the contract. This bill 
creates the Cost Recovery Fund within the PUC and transfers $6,700,000 in both fiscal year 2016-17 and fiscal year 
2017-18 from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund to the Cost Recovery Fund to pay all above-market costs of the 
contracts. The bill includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation in fiscal year 2016-17 of $6, 700,000 to allow 
the PUC to pay all above-market costs of the contracts and an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $100,974 
for consulting costs. The Maine Budget Stabilization Fund has sufficient resources to make these transfers. The PUC 
will receive an annual $100,974 increase in Other Special Revenue Funds revenue from increased assessments to fund 
the consulting costs.
