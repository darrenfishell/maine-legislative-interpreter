SUMMARY 
This amendment retains most provisions of the bill and does the following. 
1. It allows the Board of Licensure in Medicine to register a physician not licensed to 
practice in the State to provide consultative services through interstate telemedicine. 
2. As in the bill, it requires that the physician to be registered must be fully licensed 
without restriction to practice medicine in the state from which the physician provides 
telemedicine services. 
3. It specifies that the physician to be registered may provide only consultative 
services and that a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant in 
this State must retain ultimate authority over the diagnosis, care and treatment of the 
patient. 
4. It requires that the physician to be registered register with the board every 2 years, 
instead of annually as in the bill, and pay a registration fee not to exceed $500. 
5. It removes the provision in the bill exempting certain physicians from the 
registration requirement.
