SUMMARY 
This amendment deletes from the bill the proposed new crime of unlawful transfer of 
long-tenn care and custody of a child and replaces it with amendments to the existing 
crime of abandorunent of a child, prohibiting substantially the same conduct. This 
amendment adds to the crime of abandorunent of a child a prohibition on placing a child 
with or transferring the physical custody of a child to a nonrelative without court 
approval. If the child is less than 6 years of age, the crime is a Class C crime and if the 
child is less than 18 years of age, the crime is a Class D crime. This amendment creates 
an affinnative defense that the placement or transfer of custody of the child is due to the 
incarceration, military service, medical treahnent or incapacity of the person and is 
temporary and for a designated short-tenn period with a specific intent and time period 
for the return of the child. 
This amendment clarifIes that a person is prohibited from advertising for the purpose 
of finding a person to take into pennanent custody a particular child; current law provides 
that a person is prohibited from advertising for the purpose of fInding a person to adopt a 
child. This amendment removes from the provision in the bill prohibiting advertising the
