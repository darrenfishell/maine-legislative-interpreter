Department of Administrative and Financial Services is required to administer a 14 
competitive bid process for the privilege to operate a  casino, subject to application to and 15 
investigation by the Gambling Control Board.  Bids in region 1 are granted preference if 16 
the bidder is associated with the operator of an existing commercial harness racing track 17

amenities at a facility in each region.  Each bidder is also required to submit a 23 
nonrefundable privilege fee intended to mitigate the costs of administering the 24 
competitive bid process by the Department of Administrative and Financial Services and 25 
meet the costs of background checks and investigations conducted by the Gambling 26

for casinos and specifies that the revenue must be used for the purposes specifically 28 
described unless otherwise authorized.  This distribution will apply to all casinos and slot 29 
machine facilities operated in the  State as soon as a casino in Region 1 is authorized via 30 
the competitive bid process.  If an alternative purpose is authorized for the table game or 31 
slot machine revenue, all distributions must be reduced in equal proportion.  32
