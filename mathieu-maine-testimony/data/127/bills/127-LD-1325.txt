 Mandate preamble. This measure requires one or more local units of government 1 
to expand or modify activities so as to necessitate additional expenditures from local 2 
revenues but does not provide funding for at least 90% of those expenditures.  Pursuant to 3 
the Constitution of Maine, Article IX, Section 21, 2/3 of all of the members elected to 4 
each House have determined it necessary to enact this measure.  5 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  6

municipality pass to the abutting property owners to the center of the way, including any 10 
public easement, in accordance with sectio n 3026  3026 -A.  When the Department of 11 
Transportation is an abutting owner, then the interests in the way pass to the property 12 
owner opposite the department's ownership in accordance with a plan showing the right - 13 
of-way line established for the new highway  location by the department.  The plan must 14 
be referenced in the order of discontinuance.  15

 Page 2 - 127LR1363(01) -1 
 postage prepaid, first class, of notice to abutting property owners whose addresses appear 1

each abutter;  10 
D.  For a town way, whether or not a public easement will be retained.  If the existing 11 
legal rights of abutting property owners to access thei r property will be eliminated, a 12 
public easement or right -of-way for the abutting property owners must be retained; 13 
and 14 
E.  If a public easement is to be retained:  15

amended to read:  11 
1.  Vacation of ways.  Where  When  proposed town ways have been described in a 12 
recorded subdivision plan and lots have been sold with reference to the plan, the 13 
municipal officers, after notice to the municipal planning board or office, may, on their 14 
own initiative, on petition of the abutt ing property owners or on petition of any person 15 
claiming a property interest in the proposed way, vacate in whole or in part proposed 16 
ways that have not been accepted.  The municipal officers shall give best practicable 17 
notice, as defined in section 3026  3026 -A, subsection 2 1, of the proposed vacation to 18 
owners of lots on the recorded subdivision plan and their mortgagees of record. The 19 
notice shall  must  conform in substance to the following form:  20 
NOTICE  21 
(The municipal officers of) (A petition has been fi led with the municipal officers 22 
of)_____________________ (Name of Town  or City)__________________ (propose to) 23 
(to vacate) the following (ways) (way) shown upon a subdivision plan (named) (dated) 24 
(and) recorded in the_________________________County Regist ry of Deeds, Book of 25 
Plans, Volume________, Page________.  26 
(Herein list or describe ways to be vacated)  27 
If the municipal officers enter an order vacating (these ways) (this way) any person 28 
claiming an interest in (these ways) (this way) (adverse to the clai ms of the petitioners) 29 
must, within one (1) year of the recording of the order, file a written claim thereof under 30 
oath in the_________________ County Registry of Deeds and must, within one hundred 31 
eighty (180) days of the filing of the claim, commence an action in the Superior Court in 32 
___________________ County in accordance with the Maine  Revised Statutes , Title 23, 33 
section 3027 -A. 34 
The municipal officers shall file an order of vacation with the municipal clerk that 35 
specifies the location of the way, the names of owners of lots on the recorded subdivision 36 
plan and the amount of damages, if any, determined by the municipal officers to be paid 37 
to each lot owner or other person having an interest in the way.  Damages and reasonable 38 
costs as determined by the municipal officers shall  must  be paid by the petitioners, if any.  39 
Sec. 7.  23 MRSA §3028, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 1991, c. 195, is amended to 40 
read:  41 
 
 Page 4 - 127LR1363(01) -1 
 1.  Presumption of abandonment.  It Except as provided by subsection 1 -A, it  is 1 
prima facie evidence that a  town or county way not kept passable for the use of motor 2 
vehicles at the expense of the municipality or county for a period of 30 or more 3 
consecutive years has been discontinued by abandonment.  A presumption of 4 
abandonment may be rebutted by evidence th at manifests a clear intent by the 5 
municipality or county and the public to consider or use the way as if it were a public 6 
way.  A proceeding to discontinue a town or county way may not prevent or estop a 7 
municipality from asserting a presumption of abando nment.  A municipality or its 8 
officials are not liable for nonperformance of a legal duty with respect to such ways if 9 
there has been a good faith reliance on a presumption of abandonment.  Any person 10 
affected by a presumption of abandonment, including the  State or a municipality, may 11 
seek declaratory relief to finally resolve the status of such ways.  A way that has been 12 
abandoned under this section is relegated to the same status as it would have had after a 13 
discontinuance pursuant to section 3026, except  that this status  retains a public easement 14 
and all remaining interests of the municipality pass to the abutting property owners in fee 15 
simple to the center of the way.  A way that has been abandoned under this section  is at 16 
all times subject to an affirma tive vote of the legislative body of the municipality within 17 
which the way lies making that way an easement for recreational use.  A presumption of 18 
abandonment is not rebutted by evidence that shows isolated acts of maintenance, unless 19 
other evidence exist s that shows a clear intent by the municipality or county to consider 20 
or use the way as if it were a public way.  21 
Sec. 8.  23 MRSA §3028, sub -§1-A is enacted to read:  22 
1-A.  Termination through discontinuance process only.  For a town way that does 23 
not meet the requirements of subsection 1 as of January 1, 2020, a municipality may 24 
terminate in whole or in part any interests held by it for highway purposes only through 25 
the discontinuance process pursuant to section 3026 -A.  This subsection is not intended to 26 
modify common law regarding abandonment of a road.  27 
Sec. 9.  23 MRSA §3028, sub -§5 is enacted to read:  28 
5.  Filing.  If after the effective date of this subsection the municipal officers, either 29 
on their own or after being presented with evidence of abandonme nt or discontinuance, 30 
determine that a town way has been discontinued by abandonment pursuant to subsection 31 
1, the municipal clerk shall file a record of this determination with the registry of deeds 32 
and the municipality.  The registry of deeds shall recor d a document regarding an 33 
abandoned town way under the name of the town way, the name of the municipality and 34 
the names of the abutters.  If a municipality provides records obtained from the registry of 35 
deeds, the municipality may charge a reasonable fee f or these records.  36 
Sec. 10.  23 MRSA §3029 -A is enacted to read:  37 
§3029 -A.  Damage to public easement; cause of action  38 
1.  Cause of action.  An owner of property abutting a discontinued or abandoned 39 
road in which a public easement exists may bring a civil ac tion in Superior Court for 40 
damages and injunctive relief against a person who causes damage to the road in a way 41 
 
 Page 5 - 127LR1363(01) -1 
 that impedes reasonable access by the property owner to the property owner's property by 1 
motor vehicle as defined in Title 29 -A, section 101, s ubsection 42.  2 
2.  Damages.  Damages may be sought pursuant to subsection 1 in an amount 3 
reasonably necessary to restore the road to its condition prior to the use by the person 4 
against whom the action is brought.  5 
3.  Attorney's fees and costs.  If the plai ntiff under subsection 1 is the prevailing 6 
party, the plaintiff may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  7 
Sec. 11.  35-A MRSA §2308, as amended by PL 2011, c. 623, Pt. B, §9, is further 8 
amended to read:  9 
§2308.  Protection of utility facilities u pon discontinuance of public ways  10 
In proceedings for the discontinuance of public ways, public ways may be 11 
discontinued in whole or in part. The discontinuance of a town way must be pursuant to 12 
Title 23, section 3026  3026 -A.  Unless an order discontinuing a public way specifically 13 
provides otherwise, the public easement provided for in Title 23, section 3026  3026 -A 14 
includes an easement for public utility facilities and for the permitted facilities of entities 15 
authorized under section 2301 to construct lines . A utility or entity may continue to 16 
maintain, repair and replace its installations within the limits of the way or may construct 17 
and maintain new facilities within the limits of the discontinued way, if it is used for 18 
travel by motor vehicles, in order t o provide utility or telecommunications service, upon 19 
compliance with the provisions of sections 2503, 2505, 2506, 2507 and 2508.  20 
Sec. 12.  Municipalities to develop list of town ways.  A municipality may 21 
prepare a list of all town ways in that municipalit y that are currently maintained with 22 
public funds; a list of all town ways that have been discontinued since 1965 and whether 23 
or not a public easement was retained, if known; and a list of all town ways that have 24 
been abandoned since 1965 and whether or no t a public easement was retained, if known. 25 
A municipality shall publish any such lists on its publicly accessible website or make 26 
copies available at the municipal office.  A municipality may charge a reasonable fee for 27 
the lists.  A municipality shall re cord the lists at the appropriate county registry of deeds.  28 
The registry of deeds shall record these lists under the name of the municipality.  The 29 
Department of Transportation may provide a municipality a list of that municipality's 30 
state and state aid h ighways and individual town ways.  31 
SUMMARY  32 
This bill changes the laws governing discontinued and abandoned roads.  33 
Under current law, a presumption of abandonment exists if a municipality fails to 34 
keep a way passable for the use of motor vehicles at the expe nse of the municipality for a 35 
period of 30 or more years.  This bill eliminates that presumption for ways that have not 36 
met that statutory requirement by January 1, 2020.  Instead, for all other public ways, the 37 
bill provides a new discontinuance process, which will be the only means for a 38 
municipality to actively terminate its interests in a public way.  The new discontinuance 39 
process specifies 5 steps a municipality must follow to discontinue a road: the notification 40 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR1363(01) -1 
 of proposed discontinuance to the abut ting property owners; a meeting of municipal 1 
officers to discuss the proposed discontinuance and the filing of an order of 2 
discontinuance specifying whether or not there will be a public easement and any public 3 
use restrictions or municipal maintenance and  liability responsibilities for the public 4 
easement; a public hearing on the discontinuance; approval of the order of discontinuance 5 
by the municipal legislative body; and the filing of the certificate of discontinuance by the 6 
municipal clerk in the regist ry of deeds and with the municipality.  The bill requires the 7 
abutters of a public easement that is discontinued to be granted a right -of-way.  The 8 
municipality may charge a reasonable fee to fulfill any request for records obtained by the 9 
municipality fro m the registry of deeds.  10 
The bill continues to exempt a municipality from liability for nonperformance of a 11 
legal duty with respect to a town or county way that has not been kept passable for the 12 
use of motor vehicles at the expense of that municipality fo r a period of 30 or more years.  13 
It requires that a public easement must be retained in a discontinued road if abutting 14 
property owners need to use it to access their property.  It also provides that a public 15 
utility easement will be in place whenever a roa d is discontinued, regardless of whether a 16 
public easement is retained.  17 
A way that is presumptively abandoned retains a public easement, as is the default 18 
position under current law.  The bill does not modify common law abandonment.  19 
The bill allows a munic ipality to prepare a list of all town ways in that municipality 20 
that are currently maintained with public funds; a list of all town ways that have been 21 
discontinued since 1965 and whether or not a public easement was retained, if known; 22 
and a list of all t own ways that have been abandoned since 1965 and whether or not a 23 
public easement was retained, if known. If a municipality prepares a list, the municipality 24 
must publish the list on its publicly accessible website or make copies available at the 25 
municipal  office, for which the municipality may charge a reasonable fee. The 26 
municipality must record the list at the county registry of deeds.  27
