2.  Waiver.   The requirement of competitive bidding may be waived by the Director 21 
of the Bureau of General Services when:  22 
A.  The procurement of goods or services by the State for county commissioners 23 
pursuant to Title 30 -A, section 124, inv olves the expenditure of $2,500 or less, and 24 
the interests of the State would best be served;  25 
B.  The Director of the Bureau of General Services is authorized by the Governor or 26 
the Governor's designee to make purchases without competitive bidding because in 27 
the opinion of the Governor or the Governor's designee an emergency exists that 28 
requires the immediate procurement of goods or services;  29 
C.  After reasonable investigation by the Director of the Bureau of General Services, 30 
it appears that any required u nit or item of supply, or brand of that unit or item, is 31 
procurable by the State from only one source;  32

 Page 2 - 127LR1988(01) -1

university system, community college system, Maine Maritime Academy or a 2 
private, nonprofit, regionally accredited institution of higher education with a 3

service; and  5 
(2)  A sharing of project responsibilities and, when appropriate, costs;  6

which case the Director of the Bureau  of General Services may accept oral proposals 8 
or bids; or  9 
G.  The procurement of goods or services involves expenditures of $10,000 or less, 10 
and procurement from a single source is the most economical, effective and 11 
appropriate means of fulfilling a demon strated need.  12 
3.  Report.   By January 15th of each year the Director of the Bureau of General 13 
Services shall submit to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 14 
jurisdiction over state and local government a report concerning any waivers from the 15 
competitive bidding provisions established in subsection 2, paragraph E.  16 
4.  Registry of suppliers.   Suppliers desiring to have their names entered on a 17 
registry of suppliers must submit a request to the Director of the Bureau of General 18 
Services in wr iting.  The Director of the Bureau of General Services may prescribe the 19 
manner and form in which such a request must be submitted and may limit the number of 20 
names of out -of-state bidders on any registry.  The name of any supplier entered in such a 21 
regist ry who fails to submit a bid on 3 consecutive proposals or invitations to bid may be 22 
removed from the registry at the discretion of the Director of the Bureau of General 23 
Services, except that the Department of Corrections remains on any registry until the 24 
Department of Corrections requests that the department be removed from that registry.  25 
5.  Alternate bids.   When, in bid forms and specifications, an article or material is 26 
identified by using a trade name and catalog number of a manufacturer or vendor, the  27 
term "or approved equal," if not inserted with the identification, is implied.  There is a 28 
presumption that any reference to a particular manufacturer's product either by trade 29 
name or by limited description has been made solely for the purpose of more cl early 30 
indicating the minimum standard of quality desired.  Consideration must be given to 31 
proposals submitted on approved equal alternate commodities to the extent that such 32 
action serves the best interest of the State.  The bidder submitting a proposal on  a 33 
commodity other than as specified shall furnish complete identification, descriptive 34 
literature or data with respect to the alternate commodity that the bidder proposes to 35 
furnish.  Lack of such information on the bid must be construed to mean that the bidder 36 
proposes to furnish the exact commodity described.  The State reserves the right to reject 37 
any bids, in whole or in part, to waive any formality or technicality in any bid and to 38 
accept any item in any bid.  39 
6.  Record of bids.   Each bid, with the na me of the bidder, must be entered on a 40

 Director of the Bureau of General Services, with the approval of the Commissioner of 1 
Administrative and Financial Services.  2 
7.  Awards to best -value bidder.   Except as otherwise provided by law, 3 
competitively a warded  orders awarded , grants  or contracts made by the Director of the 4 
Bureau of General Services or by any department or agency of the State must be awarded 5 
to the best -value bidder, taking into consideration the qualities of the goods or services to 6 
be supplied, their conformity with the specifications, the purposes for which they are 7 
required, the date of delivery and the best interest of the State.  If the bidder that was 8 
initially awarded the order , grant  or contract does not perform, the Director of t he Bureau 9 
of General Services may cancel the order, grant or  contract and award a new order, grant 10 
or contract to the 2nd best -value bidder.  The order , grant  or contract may not be awarded 11 
to a bidder that the Director of the Bureau of General Services de termined was not in 12 
compliance at the time the initial bid was submitted.  13 
8.  Tie bids.   The Director of the Bureau of General Services shall award contracts , 14 
grants  or purchases to in -state bidders or to bidders offering commodities produced or 15 
manufactur ed in the State if the price, quality, availability and other factors are 16 
equivalent.  17 
9.  Determination of best -value bidder.   In determining the best -value bidder, the 18 
Director of the Bureau of General Services or any department or agency of the State sha ll, 19 
for the purpose of competitively  awarding a contract or grant , add a percent increase on 20 
the bid of a nonresident bidder equal to the percent, if any, of the preference given to that 21 
bidder in the state in which the bidder resides.  22 
10.  List of state p references published.   The Director of the Bureau of General 23 
Services on or before January 1st of each year shall publish a list of states that give 24 
preference to in -state bidders with the percent increase applied in each such state.  The 25 
Director of the B ureau of General Services or any department or agency of the State may 26 
rely on the names of states and percentages as published in determining the best -value 27 
bidder without incurring any liability to any bidder.  28 
11.  Rulemaking; unfair competition.   State departments and agencies may not 29 
achieve cost savings due to cost differentials that derive from a bidder's failure to provide 30 
health and retirement benefits to its employees.  The State Purchasing Agent shall adopt 31 
rules governing the purchase of services  and the awarding of grants or contracts for 32 
personal services to establish a basis for bid price and cost comparison among businesses 33 
that provide health and retirement benefits to their employees and those that do not 34 
provide these benefits.  The rules m ust include a methodology for calculating bid price 35 
and cost differentials for services provided by businesses and state employees due to the 36 
provision of health and retirement benefits for employees.  The rules must adjust the bid 37 
prices to establish an e quivalent basis for bid price and cost comparison among 38 
businesses when awarding contracts or grants  and between businesses and state 39 
employees when determining whether or not a contract or grant  is permitted under section 40 
1816 -A.  These rules must apply t o all state departments and agencies.  Rules adopted 41 
pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in chapter 375, 42

this section.  The State Purchasing Agent shall apply the fee under this subsection to the 3 
costs of implementing and administering the state purchasing code of conduct under 4 
section 182 5-L, including developing a consortium to monitor and investigate alleged 5 
violations of the code of conduct.  The State Purchasing Agent shall adopt routine 6 
technical rules under chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A to carry out the purposes of this 7 
subsection.  8 
13.  Vendor's fee report.   By January 15th of each year the Director of the Bureau of 9 
General Services shall submit a report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 10 
having jurisdiction over state and local government matters concerning revenue gene rated 11 
by the vendor's fee established in subsection 12.  12 
14.  Condition of doing business with the State.   Notwithstanding any provision of 13 
law to the contrary, any purchase by the State of $100,000 or more of tangible personal 14 
property, except for public u tility purchases, as defined in Title 36, section 1752, 15 
subsection 17, or emergency purchases pursuant to subsection 2, paragraph B, may be 16

1754 -B.  As a condition of doing  business with the State, the seller must collect, report 18

issued by  the State Tax Assessor within 7 business days.  If the seller fails to provide the 24 
registration certificate within 7 business days, the State Purchasing Agent may cancel the 25 
award and make a new award pursuant to subsection 7.  The State Purchasing Agent shall 26 
provide the State Tax Assessor with a copy of all contracts and grants  awarded pursuant 27 
to this section.  The State Tax Assessor shall notify the State Purchasing Agent if at any 28 
time during the term of the contract or grant  the person is no longer r egistered or is not 29 
collecting, reporting and remitting taxes in compliance with the requirements of Title 36, 30 
Part 3.  Until the noncompliance is corrected, the State Purchasing Agent may withhold 31 
any payments to the person.  32
