 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  20-A MRSA §15672, sub -§23, ¶C, as enacted by PL 2013, c. 203, §1, is 2 
repealed and the following enacted in its place:  3 
C.  For fiscal year 2015 -16 and each subsequent fiscal year:  4 
(1)  T he average of the certified state valuations for the 3 most recent years prior 5 
to the most recently certified state valuation; or  6 
(2)  For a municipality with a most recently certified state valuation that was 7 
certified by the State Tax Assessor in recogni tion that the municipality 8 
experienced a net reduction in equalized municipal valuation attributable to a 9 
single property taxpayer of at least 2% from the equalized municipal valuation 10 
since the prior state valuation:  11 
(a)  For the first year, the most rece ntly certified state valuation;  12 
(b)  For the 2nd year, the average of the certified state valuation for the year 13 
prior to the most recently certified state valuation and the most recently 14 
certified state valuation;  15 
(c)  For the 3rd year, the average of the  certified state valuations for the 2 16 
most recent years prior to the most recently certified state valuation and the 17 
most recently certified state valuation; and  18 
(d)  For the 4th and each subsequent year, the same as in subparagraph (1).  19 
SUMMARY  20 
Current la w defines a municipality's fiscal capacity for the purpose of calculating the 21 
local share and state share of the cost of public kindergarten to grade 12 education as the 22 
average state valuation for the municipality over a 3 -year period prior to the most re cently 23 
certified state valuation. In order to avoid overstating the fiscal capacity of a municipality 24 
that has experienced a significant loss in value of 2% or more attributable to a single 25 
taxpayer, this bill resets the 3 -year period to average state valu ations for those 26 
municipalities going forward, beginning with the first year the municipality's certified 27 
state valuation reflects that significant loss in value.  28
