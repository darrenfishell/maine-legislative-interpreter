HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
127TH LEGISLATURE 
SECOND REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 771, L.D. 1110, Bill, "An Act To 
Modernize Road User Fees" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'Resolve, To Study Transportation Funding Reform' 
Amend the bill by striking out everything after the title and inserting the following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, adequate, sustainable and predictable transportation funding is critical to 
the safety and economic well-being of all Maine citizens; and 
Whereas, funding for transportation infrastructure in Maine and the nation is 
seriously deficient; and 
Whereas, the shortfall of funding related to Maine's state highway and bridge 
system is at least $168,000,000 per year, without consideration of general obligation 
bonding; and 
Whereas, the shortfall of capital funding related to Maine's multimodal system of 
ports, rail and other modes of transportation is substantial; and 
Whereas, general obligation bonding levels are unpredictable due to the current 
short-term focus of the process that determines bonding levels and priorities, a process 
that usually takes place late in a legislative session after finalization of the General Fund 
budget, if at all; and 
Whereas, higher fuel efficiency of vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles continue to 
erode the funding provided by per gallon fuel taxes and increase the inequity among 
drivers in terms of the fee paid per mile for use of the highway and bridge system; and 
Whereas, fuel prices are relatively low but surely will rise in the years ahead; and

Whereas, approximately 30,000,000 people visit Maine each year, a state with a 
year-round population of about 1,300,000 people, and the capacity and a significant 
portion of the cost of Maine's transportation system are driven by seasonal traffic 
volumes; and 
Whereas, through years of capital planning, prioritization and efficiency initiatives, 
the Department of Transportation has proven that it uses funding efficiently and 
effectively; and 
Whereas, although federal transportation funding levels have been established for 
the next 5 years, these funding levels will not solve Maine's transportation funding 
problems and additional federal funding solutions are unlikely; and 
Whereas, other states are finding transportation funding solutions and the State has 
an obligation to all its citizens to seek solutions now; and 
Whereas, the Joint Standing Committee on Transportation is charged with 
analyzing options and recommending legislation and is best-equipped to study these 
issues and find ways to reform and supplement transportation funding in Maine; and 
Whereas, the study must be initiated before the 90-day period expires in order that 
the study may be completed and a report submitted in time for submission to the next 
legislative session; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, be it 
Sec. 1. Study established. Resolved: That the Joint Standing Committee on 
Transportation, referred to in this resolve as "the committee," shall study how to reform 
and adequately supplement funding for the State's transportation infrastructure to promote 
equity, sustainability and predictability in a manner that allows the State to responsibly 
provide a safe and reliable state transportation system; and be it further 
Sec. 2. Convening of committee. Resolved: That the chairs of the committee 
shall call and convene the first meeting of the committee for the purposes of this resolve 
no later than 30 days following the effective date of this resolve; and be it further 
Sec. 3. Meetings. Resolved: That the committee may meet for the purposes of 
this resolve only when the Legislature is not in regular or special session. The committee 
may meet up to 4 times to accomplish its duties. At least 2 meetings must allow public 
comment; and be it further 
Sec. 4. Duties. Resolved: That the committee shall focus on funding the state 
highway and bridge system, but shall also consider capital funding through the issuance 
of bonds for multimodal infrastructure. The committee shall: 
1. Identify mechanisms that will increase the predictability of general obligation 
bonding levels for capital planning at the Department of Transportation for the state 
highway and bridge system and multimodal infrastructure for the next 10 years;

2. Consult with the Secretary of State to identify mechanisms to address the erosion 
of Highway Fund receipts and the rising inequity among drivers caused by higher 
automobile fuel efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles, such as adding a registration fee 
surcharge on hybrid, electric or other alternative fuel passenger automobiles or a 
voluntary so-called "vehicle miles traveled" pilot program for passenger automobiles; 
3. Consult with the Secretary of State to consider adjustments to motor vehicle fees 
that will bring these fees in line with regional averages; 
4. Consider dedicating a portion of sales tax receipts from transportation-related sales 
to transportation infrastructure; 
5. Consider adding a wholesale fuel tax component, including options that would 
reduce baseline per gallon fuel tax rates; 
6. Consider adjusting fuel tax rates, including a pump-price surcharge that is 
eliminated as fuel prices increase, or a reduction of the year-round baseline gasoline tax 
rates and the addition of a seasonal gasoline tax surcharge; and 
7. Invite knowledgeable stakeholders to provide written and oral comments on draft 
recommendations of the committee. Knowledgeable stakeholders must include 
representatives from the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, the 
Maine Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Associated General 
Contractors of Maine, the Maine Automobile Dealers Association, the Maine Better 
Transportation Association, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the Mayors' 
Coalition on Jobs and Economic Development, the Maine Motor Transport Association, 
the Maine Municipal Association, the Maine Service Center Coalition, the Maine 
Tourism Association and the Maine Turnpike Authority; and be it further 
Sec. 5. Cooperation. Resolved: That the Commissioner of Transportation shall 
provide information and data to the committee as necessary for its work; and be it further 
Sec. 6. Staff assistance. Resolved: That the Legislative Council shall provide 
necessary staffing services to the committee; and be it further 
Sec. 7. Report. Resolved: That, no later than November 2, 2016, the committee 
shall submit a report that includes its findings and recommendations, including suggested 
legislation, for presentation to the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature. The 
joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over transportation matters 
may submit legislation to the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature related to the 
report; and be it further 
Sec. 8. Funding. Resolved: That the costs of the study must be provided from the 
Highway Fund by appropriate appropriation or allocation. 
Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.'
