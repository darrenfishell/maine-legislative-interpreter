amount equal to $30 for each employee enrolled after January 1, 2017 in either a

income protection plan, as long as the employee enrolled in a qualified short-term 
disability income protection plan or a qualified long-term disability income protection 
plan was not covered under a disability income protection plan offered by the employing 
unit in the tax year immediately preceding the year in which the credit is first available. 
The credit must be claimed by a taxpayer in the first tax year during which the taxpayer is 
eligible to claim the credit and may be taken for no more than 3 consecutive tax years.

information regarding the employer-sponsored group disability income protection plan 
and the employee's right to opt out of coverage at least 30 days prior and a 2nd time at 
least 10 days prior to the initial payroll deduction of premiums. 
Like the bill, the amendment provides a tax credit to employers providing a qualified 
short-term disability income protection plan or a qualified long-term disability income 
protection plan. Disability income protection plans that do not qualify for the tax credit 
may still be authorized to be issued in the State by the Department of Professional and 
Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance. 
The amendment provides that an employer is entitled to a tax credit of $30 for each 
employee enrolled in a group disability income protection plan after January 1, 2017, as 
long as the employee was not covered under a disability income protection plan offered 
by the employing unit in the tax year immediately preceding the year in which the credit 
is first available. The credit must be claimed by a taxpayer in the first tax year during 
which the taxpayer is eligible to claim the credit and may be taken for no more than 3 
consecutive tax years. The amendment specifies that the amount of the credit may not 
exceed the amount of the tax due and that unused credit may not be carried over or 
carried back. The bill proposes a tax credit of $50, which would be available for 5 years. 
The amendment clarifies that an employer's federal adjusted gross income must be 
increased by the amount claimed as a deduction related to a taxpayer's expenses for a 
qualified long-term disability income protection plan or qualified short-term disability 
income protection plan during the taxable year for which a tax credit is claimed. The 
amendment clarifies that the determination of whether an employer can claim the tax 
credit for an eligible employee is based on the terms and conditions of the qualified long­
term or short-term disability income protection plan selected by the employer. The 
amendment also permits the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, 
Bureau of Revenue Services to share information with the Department of Professional 
and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance as necessary to determine the qualification 
of long-term or short-term disability income protection plans for the tax credit. 
This amendment also corrects a numbering problem created by Public Law 2015, 
chapters 300 and 344, which enacted 2 substantively different provisions with the same 
paragraph designation.

The bill provides a tax credit to employers for providing certain group disability income protection plans. The initial 
impact would be expected in fiscal year 2017-18, with an estimated reduction in General Fund revenue of $28,420 and 
a reduction in Local Government Fund revenue of $580. With no data available on the effect of automatic enrollment 
on group disability insurance coverage, this fiscal note assumes a modest number of credits in the early years of the 
program, as there will be some "ramp up" time for policies with automatic enrollment to gain popularity.
