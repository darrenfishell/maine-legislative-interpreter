who is in a. position of trust or authority over another person to use that clergy's position 
of trust or authority to engage in a sexual act, sexual contact or sexual touching with the 
other person. It also places the current definition of "domestic partner" under the 
definition section of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17 -A, chapter 11 and deletes 
repetitive definitions of "domestic partner" found throughout the chapter. This 
amendment clarifies that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2013 
applies only prospectively, including with respect to offenses in other jurisdictions.
