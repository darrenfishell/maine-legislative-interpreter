 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  18-A MRSA §5 -104, sub -§(a), as amended by PL 2011, c. 43, §1, is 2 
further amended to read:  3 
(a).  A parent or guardian of a minor or incapacitated person, by a properly executed 4 
power of attorney, may delegate to another person, for a period not exceeding 12 months, 5 
any of that parent's or guardian's powers regarding care, custody or property of the minor 6 
child or ward, except the power to consent to marriage or, adoption of a minor ward , the 7 
performance of an abortion procedure on or for the minor or the incapacitated person or 8 
the termination of parental rights to the minor .  A delegation by a court -appointed 9 
guardian becomes effective only when the power of attorney is filed with the cou rt.  A 10 
delegation of powers under this section does not deprive the parent or guardian of any 11 
parental or legal authority regarding the care and custody of the minor or incapacitated 12 
person.  13 
Sec. 2.  18-A MRSA §5 -104, sub -§(c) is enacted to read:  14 
(c).  The execution of a power of attorney by a parent or guardian under subsection 15 
(a) does not constitute abandonment, abuse or neglect unless the parent or guardian fails 16 
to take custody of the minor or incapacitated person or execute a new power of attorney 17 
after the power of attorney is terminated.  If the power of attorney is terminated, the 18 
minor or incapacitated person must be returned to the custody of the parent or guardian as 19 
soon as reasonably possible.  Unless the power of attorney is terminated, the ag ent named 20 
in the power of attorney shall exercise parental or legal authority on a continuous basis 21 
without compensation for the duration of the power of attorney authorized by subsection 22 
(a) and is not subject to any laws regarding the licensure or regula tion of foster care 23 
homes.  A minor may not be considered to be placed in foster care by virtue of the 24 
execution of a power of attorney under this section.  25 
SUMMARY  26 
This bill amends current law allowing a parent or guardian to execute a temporary 27 
power of a ttorney for up to 12 months, delegating the powers regarding the care and 28 
custody of a child or incapacitated person, by doing the following:  29 
1.  Limiting the power of attorney to exclude the parent or guardian's powers 30 
regarding the performance of an abor tion for the minor or the incapacitated person or the 31 
termination of parental rights to the minor;  32 
2.  Clarifying that executing this temporary power of attorney does not deprive the 33 
parent or guardian of any parental or legal authority regarding the care and custody of the 34 
minor or incapacitated person;  35 
3.  Clarifying that a parent or guardian's granting of this temporary power of attorney 36 
does not constitute abandonment, abuse or neglect, if the parent or guardian either 37 
executes a new power of attorney o r takes custody of the child or incapacitated person as 38 
soon as reasonably possible after the termination of the temporary power of attorney;  39 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR0721(01) -1
