10 Secure the Maine Electrical Grid from Long-tern1 Blackouts" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3144 is enacted to read: 
14 §3144. Protection from geomagnetic disturbances 
15 The commission shall direct transmission and distribution utilities to take all cost-
16 effective actions to ensure that their systems are protected from or able to negate effects

electromagnetic pulses and limits the directive to severe geomagnetic disturbances only. 
2 The amendment specifies that any action directed by the commission must be cost-
3 effective and at a minimum consistent with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 
4 reliability standards. It removes language that prohibits a transmission and distribution 
5 utility from collecting from ratepayers costs to address the failure of the system due to 
6 geomagnetic disturbances or electromagnetic pulses. 
7 The amendment changes the specific mitigation measures the bill requires the Public 
8 Utilities Commission to direct transmission and distribution utilities to undertake to 
9 protect their systems from geomagnetic disturbances and electromagnetic pulses and 
10 instead requires that the commission order transmission and distribution utilities to install 
11 and operate equipment to protect and monitor their 345-kilovolt transformers and other 
12 critical equipment against severe geomagnetic disturbances. This amendment requires the 
13 work to protect the 345-kilovolt transformers be completed no later than December 31, 
14 2020, but the time frame for that work is to be determined from a collaboration between 
15 the commission and transmission and distribution utilities.
