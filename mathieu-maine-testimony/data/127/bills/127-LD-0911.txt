 Page 2 - 127LR1529(01) -1 
 includes a proposed wind energy development.  The viewshed of a scenic resource may 1 
include the visible proposed wind energy development from a singl e viewer position or 2 
the visible proposed wind energy development from multiple viewer positions.  The 3 
viewshed of a scenic resource is limited to the geographic area within 15 miles, measured 4 
horizontally, from the proposed wind energy development's gener ating facilities.  5 
Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub -§3, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 6 
amended to read:  7 
3.  Evaluation criteria.  In making its determination pursuant to subsection 1, and in 8 
determining whether an applicant for an expedited wind energy development must 9 
provide a visual impact assessment in accordance with subsection 4, the primary siting 10 
authority shall consider:  11 
A.  The significance of the potentially affected scenic resource of state or national 12 
significance;  13 
B.  The existing ch aracter of the surrounding area;  14 
C.  The expectations of the typical viewer;  15 
D.  The expedited wind energy development's purpose and the context of the 16 
proposed activity;  17 
E.  The extent, nature and duration of potentially affected public uses of the scenic  18 
resource of state or national significance and the potential effect of the generating 19 
facilities' presence on the public's continued use and enjoyment of the scenic resource 20 
of state or national significance; and  21 
F.   The scope and scale of the potential effect of views of the generating facilities on 22 
the scenic resource of state or national significance, including but not limited to 23 
issues related to the number and extent of turbines visible from the scenic resource of 24 
state or national significance, the distance from the scenic resource of state or 25 
national significance and the effect of prominent features of the development on the 26 
landscape.  27 
In applying these evaluation criteria, the primary siting authority shall consider the 28 
primary impact and the cumu lative scenic impact or effect of the development during 29 
both day and night on scenic resources of state or national significance.   A finding by the 30 
primary siting authority that the development's generating facilities are a highly visible 31 
feature in the l andscape is not a solely sufficient basis for determination that an expedited 32 
wind energy project has an unreasonable adverse effect on the scenic character and 33 
existing uses related to scenic character of a scenic resource of state or national 34 
significanc e.  In making its determination under subsection 1, the primary siting authority 35 
shall consider insignificant the effects of portions of the development's generating 36 
facilities located more than 8 miles, measured horizontally, from a scenic resource of 37 
state or national significance.  38 
Sec. 6.  35-A MRSA §3452, sub -§4, as enacted by PL 2007, c. 661, Pt. A, §7, is 39 
repealed and the following enacted in its place:  40 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR1529(01) -1 
 4.  Visual impact assessment; rebuttable presumption.  An applicant for an 1 
expedited wind energy de velopment shall provide the primary siting authority with a 2 
visual impact assessment of the development that addresses the evaluation criteria in 3 
subsection 3 as follows.  4 
A.  If portions of the development's generating facilities are located within 8 miles , 5 
measured horizontally, from a scenic resource of state or national significance, a 6 
visual impact assessment is required.  7 
B.  Notwithstanding paragraph C, if portions of the development's generating 8 
facilities are located within 15 miles, measured horizon tally, from Acadia National 9 
Park, the Appalachian Trail, a federally designated wilderness area, Baxter State Park 10 
or the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a visual impact assessment is required.  11 
C.  If portions of the development's generating facilities are l ocated more than 8 miles 12 
and up to 15 miles, measured horizontally, from a scenic resource of state or national 13 
significance, there is a rebuttable presumption that a visual impact assessment is 14 
required. Information intended to rebut the presumption must be submitted to the 15 
primary siting authority by the applicant with the application.  An interested person 16 
may respond to the applicant's rebuttal information within 30 days of the acceptance 17 
by the primary siting authority of the application as complete fo r processing.  18 
D.  The primary siting authority may require a visual impact assessment for portions 19 
of the development's generating facilities located more than 15 miles, measured 20 
horizontally, from a scenic resource of state or national significance if it finds that 21 
there is substantial evidence that a visual impact assessment is needed to determine if 22 
there is the potential for unreasonable adverse effects on scenic resources of state or 23 
national significance.  Information intended to rebut or support the need for a visual 24 
impact assessment of effects on scenic resources more than 15 miles from the 25 
development's generating facilities must be submitted to the primary siting authority 26 
by the applicant or any interested person not later than 60 days after acce ptance by 27 
the primary siting authority of the application as complete for processing.  The 28 
applicant has an additional 15 days to respond to information submitted by interested 29 
persons.  30 
The primary siting authority shall make decisions under this subsectio n based on a 31 
preponderance of evidence in the record.  32 
SUMMARY  33 
This bill:  34 
1.  Creates several new definitions relating to the scenic impact of a wind energy 35 
development;  36 
2.  Allows for the consideration of cumulative scenic impacts in the permitting of 37 
wind  energy developments;  38 
3.  Adds to the definition of "scenic resource of state or national significance" great 39 
ponds that were studied for their value in 1987 or 1989 and that have on them commercial 40 
sporting camps established prior to 2007;  41

 4.  Allows the Department of Environmental Protection to require a visual impact 1 
assessment for wind energy developments located within 15 miles of scenic resources of 2 
state or national significance and mandates a visual impact assessment if a generating 3 
facility is loca ted within 15 miles of specific scenic resources of state or national 4 
significance; and  5 
5.  Allows the Department of Environmental Protection to require a visual impact 6 
assessment for wind energy developments located beyond 15 miles from scenic resources 7 
of state or national significance under certain limited circumstances.  8
