9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to S.P. 484, L.D. 1339, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Provide Relief to Maine Ratepayers" 
11 Amend the bill by striking out everything after the enacting clause and before the 
12 summary and inserting the following: 
13 'Sec. 1. 35-A MRSA §3210, sub-§9, as amended by PL 2011, c. 637, §1, is 
14 further amended to read: 
15 9. Alternative compliance payment; portfolio requirements for new renewable 
16 capacity resources. The commission shall allow competitive electricity providers to 
1 7 satisfy the portfolio requirements for new renewable capacity resources under subsection 
18 3-A through an alternative compliance payment mechanism in accordance with this 
19 subsection. 
20 A. The commission shall set the alternative compliance payment rate by rule and 
21 shall publish the alternative compliance payment rate by January 31st of each year. In 
22 setting the rate, the commission shall take into account prevailing market prices, 
23 standard-offer service prices for electricity, reliance on alternative compliance 
24 payments to meet the requirements of subsection 3-A and investment in new 
25 renewable capacity resources in the State during the previous calendar year. To the 
26 maximum extent practicable, the commission shall set the alternative compliance 
27 payment rate at a level that reduces higher revenue for generators of new renewable 
28 capacity resources when electricity supply prices increase to historically high levels, 
29 as determined by the commission. 
30 A-1. The commission shall reduce the alternative compliance payment rate by 100%, 
31 suspending the renewable portfolio requirement, if the annualized average standard 
32 offer electricity supply pricing for residential customers is 10¢ per kilowatt hour or 
33 higher. 
34 B. The commission shall collect alternative compliance payments made by 
35 competitive electricity providers and shall deposit all funds collected under this 
36 paragraph in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fund established under

14 COMMITIEE AMENDMENT" /Jr" to S.P. 484, L.D. 1339 
section 10121, subsection 2 to be ust:d to fund research, development and 
demonstration projects relating to renewable energy technologies and to fund rebates 
for cost-effective renewable energy technologies. 
The commission shall adopt rules to implement this subsection. Rules adopted under this 
subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment, which is the minority report, strikes the bill and instead allows the 
Public Utilities Commission, when it determines that electricity supply prices are at 
historically high levels, to set the alternative compliance payment rate for new renewable 
capacity resources at a level that reduces higher revenue for generators of new renewable 
capacity resources. The amendment also specifies that if the annualized average standard 
offer electricity supply pricing for residential customers is 10¢ per kilowatt hour or 
higher, the commission must reduce the alternative compliance payment rate by 100%, 
which has the effect of suspending the renewable portfolio requirement.

resources is not expected to be significant. From fiscal year 2013-14 through fiscal year 2015-16 to date only $5,475 
has been collected from these payments.
