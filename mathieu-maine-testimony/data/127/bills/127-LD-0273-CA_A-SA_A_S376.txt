Fiscal Note for Senate Amendment'~" to Committee Amendment "A" (S-.31~) 
Sponsor: Sen. Woodsome of York 
Fiscal Note Required: Yes 
Fiscal Note 
Eliminates potential future biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Eliminates potential future transfer to Efficiency Maine Trust 
Eliminates future minor savings -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The amendment repeals, on June 30, 2020, portfolio requirements for waste-to-energy resources and the alternative 
compliance payments used to satisfy those portfolio requirements. This eliminates any potential Other Special 
Revenue Funds revenue to the Public Utilities Commission starting in fiscal year 2020-21. These revenues would have 
been transferred to the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resource Fl,lnd within the Efficiency Maipe Trust. The PUC 
had not anticipated any competitive electricity providers to make these payments in lieu of compliance. Any 
additional future costs the PUC would have incurred to require waste-to-energy resources to meet certain portfolio 
requirements had been expected to be minor and are now eliminated after June 30,2020.
