The bill establishes the Plastics and Paper Recycling Fund in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) 
through a collection of 3¢ or 4¢, depending on the retailer, from a 5¢ surcharge assessed on single-use point-of-sale 
disposable bags. The retailer will retain the other 1 ¢ or 2¢. This bill also requires the DEP to conduct an intensive 
public education campaign regarding the environmental damage from single-use disposable bags. The bill includes 
Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $104,116 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $103,872 in fiscal year 2016-17 for 
an Office Associate II position, an Environmental Specialist III position, rulemaking and other administrative and 
technology costs associated with the administration of the Plastics and Paper Recycling Fund program. Revenue 
realized through this surcharge is estimated to cover the cost of these allocations.
