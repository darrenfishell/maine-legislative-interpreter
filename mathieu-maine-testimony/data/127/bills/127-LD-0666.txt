8.  Rules.  The department may adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section, 17 
inclu ding defining the content and scope of any instruction given under subsection 5 or 6.  18 
Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules pursuant to Title 5, 19

hospital is required to notify the caregiver prior to the patient's being discharged or 26 
transferred, consult with the caregiver as to the patient's discharge plan and provide the 27 
caregiver any necessa ry instruction in providing aftercare to the patient if the patient is 28
