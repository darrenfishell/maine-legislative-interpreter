Current law provides that, in making appointments to positions in the classified 19

separated veterans of the Armed Forces of t he United States and to the spouse of a 21 
disabled veteran, the widow or widower of a veteran and the parents of a deceased 22 
veteran who lost his or her life under honorable conditions while serving on active duty. 23 
This bill repeals that language and provides  preference in the form of an interview to any 24 
person who has served on active duty in the United States Armed Forces including the 25 
Reserves of the United States Armed Forces and the National Guard and received a 26 
discharge other than dishonorable and who m eets the minimum qualifications established 27 
for a position.  28 
The bill also repeals the provision that authorizes certain veterans and certain family 29 
members of disabled or deceased veterans to file an application for and reopen an open 30 
competitive examinati on during the life of an eligible register resulting from a published 31 
announcement.  32
