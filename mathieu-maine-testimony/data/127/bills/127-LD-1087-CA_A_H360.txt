8 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A" to H.P. 748, L.D. 1087 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the wording of the starting point of the 5-day period within 
which a written notice of denial of a public records request must be provided. 
This amendment deletes the language referring to a trial de novo, which was 
inadvertently retained in the bill. 
This amendment strikes out the section of the bill that requires public access officers 
to acknowledge requests for public records within 5 working days because that proposal 
is included in another bill as amended.
