13 Amend the bill in section 1 in subsection 12 by striking out all of paragraph H (page 
14 2, lines 30 to 32 in L.D.) and inserting the following: 
15 'H. A pharmacy may request mediation by a private mediator, agreed upon by the 
16 pharmacy and the pharmacy benefits manager, to resolve any disagreements related 
17 to maximum allowable costs for a prescription drug. A request for mediation does 
18 not waive any existing rights of appeal available to a pharmacy under this subsection. 
19 I. The requirements of this subsection apply to contracts between a pharmacy and a 
20 pharmacy benefits manager executed or renewed on or after January 1, 2016.' 
21 SUMMARY 
22 This amendment is the majority report of the committee. The amendment provides 
23 that a pharmacy benefits manager may set a maximum allowable cost for a prescription 
24 drug only if that drug is nationally available and has 2 or more nationally available 
25 therapeutically equivalent drug substitutes with a significant cost difference rather than 3 
26 or more as provided in the bill. The amendment also replaces the provision in the bill 
27 authorizing the Superintendent of Insurance to enforce violations with a provision 
28 granting a pharmacy the right to request mediation by a private mediator to resolve 
29 disagreements related to maximum allowable cost pricing. 
30 The amendment specifies that the provisions apply to contracts between a pharmacy 
31 and a pharmacy benefits manager executed or renewed on or after January 1,2016.

No impact on State Employee Health Plan 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) makes clear that self-funded plans are not required to meet 
the requirements of general insurance carriers, other than specifically mandated requirements. This bill is not an 
insurance mandate and, therefore, the State Employee Health Plan, which is a self-funded plan, is not required to 
implement the provisions of this bill.
