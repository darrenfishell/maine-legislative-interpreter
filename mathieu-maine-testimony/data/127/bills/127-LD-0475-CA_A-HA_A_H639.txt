This amendment removes the emergency preamble and emergency clause from the bill and adjusts the total funding to 
$10,000,000 for the services provided under Section 29: Home and Community Benefits for Members with 
Intellectual Disabilities or Autistic Disorder. In accord with a later start date, this amendment removes the General 
Fund appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of $412,856 in fiscal year 2015-16. 
Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations in fiscal year 2015-16 are also removed. To 
adjust total funding for Section 29 services, this amendment also reduces the General Fund appropriation to DHHS by 
$1,746,713 in fiscal year 2016-17. Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations in fiscal 
year 2016-17 are also reduced. 
Furthermore, this amendment reduces the General Fund appropriation by $4,807,600 for the removal of the funding 
for the services provided under Section 21: Home and Community Benefits for Members with Intellectual Disabilities 
or Autistic Disorder. Federal Expenditures Fund and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations in fiscal year 2016-17 
are also reduced for the removal of Section 21 services funding.
