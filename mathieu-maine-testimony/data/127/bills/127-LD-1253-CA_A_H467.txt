This bill includes a one-time General Fund appropriation of $108,578 in fiscal year 2015-16 to the PK-20, Adult 
Education and Federal Programs Team within the Department of Education for 2 limited-period Education Specialist 
III positions and related all other costs to support the task force created to design a school assessment system to 
evaluate the performance of public schools, public charter schools and private schools approved for tuition purposes 
that enroll at least 60% publicly funded students in the State. The appropriation is to support the costs of the positions 
and the task force from October 1,2015 through January 31, 2016. 
The Department of Education indicates that it may require additional positions to support the increased workload 
associated with implementing a school assessment system to measure school performance and student proficiency that 
includes multiple measures of student achievement for the 2017-2018 school year. The department also indicates that 
the costs of implementing additional assessments beyond the summative assessments currently implemented by the 
State could be approximately $7.0 million per year. This estimate is based on the assumption that, for any additional 
assessment required from the State for use in school evaluations, an alternate assessment for severely cognitively 
delayed students must also be developed. This fiscal note does not include General Fund appropriations to fund the 
positions or the additional assessments. However, depending on the recommendations of the task force and legislation 
reported out of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee during the second regular session of the 127th 
Legislature to implement the recommendations, additional General Fund appropriations may be required.
