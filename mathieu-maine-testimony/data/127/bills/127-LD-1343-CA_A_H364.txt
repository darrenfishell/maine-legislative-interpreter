SUMMARY 
This amendment establishes the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund and 
appropriates $500,000 per year of the next biennium to the fund. It amends existing law 
regarding education assistance grants to Maine National Guard members to govern the 
distribution of the tuition benefit provided by the bill. Under the bill, tuition assistance is 
provided in the form of waivers from a state postsecondary education institution. The 
amendment provides that the Maine National Guard Postsecondary Fund will provide for 
100% of an eligible member's tuition costs. If the tuition benefit costs exceed the amount 
in the fund, the amendment states that the benefit will be provided in the form of a waiver 
from the state postsecondary education institution. The amendment clarifies that tuition 
does not include lab fees or other mandatory fees charged to students. The amendment 
specifies that the benefit entitles a member to one postsecondary education credential, 
whether it be at the associate, baccalaureate, certificate or licensure level. The 
amendment specifies that a member must first pursue all other state, federal and 
employer-provided benefits available and have not previously earned a bachelor's degree 
in order to qualify for the tuition benefit proposed by the bill. The amendment also 
strikes provisions in the bill that would eliminate certain potential sources of revenue to 
be used for education assistance for members of the Maine National Guard.

The bill establishes the Maine National Guard Postsecondaty Fund within the Department of Defense, Veterans and 
Emergency Management and provides General Fund appropriations to the department of $500,000 beginning in fiscal 
year 2015-16 to provide tuition assistance to eligible members. 
The requirement that the University of Maine System, the Maine Community College System and Maine Maritime 
Academy waive tuition costs that exceed the amount of tuition benefit a member receives from the Maine National 
Guard Postsecondary Fund may result in a loss of tuition revenue to the State's public postsecondary educational 
institutions. The University of Maine System estimates it's loss ofrevenue to be approximately $550,000 per year. No 
estimate is available for the other institutions at this time.
