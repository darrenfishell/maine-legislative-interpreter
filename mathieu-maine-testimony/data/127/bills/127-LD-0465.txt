project and the scope of work, which must ind icate how the funds will be spent.  28 
Upon receipt of a request for funds accompanied by the required certification, the 29 
authority shall disburse the requested amount to the incumbent local exchange carrier 30 
up to an amount not to exceed the total amount allo cated under paragraph A to the 31 
requesting carrier.  32
