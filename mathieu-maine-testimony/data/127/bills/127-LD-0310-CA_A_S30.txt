9 This amendment replaces the bill. This amendment does the following. 
10 1. It repeals and replaces a provision of law that all ows the owner or an agent of the 
1 1 owner of a store or motion picture theater to detain a person suspected of stealing from 
12 the store or unlawfully recording in a theater. Current law allows the owner or an agent 
13 of the owner to detain a person suspected of unlawfully concealing merchandise of the 
14 store or unlawfully recording in a movie theater. The amendment separates the store and 
15 movie theater provisions and allows the owner of a store or the agent of the owner to 
16 detain a person suspected of unlawfully concealing or stealing merchandise of the store. 
17 The amendment makes no changes to the substance of the law on unlawfully recording in 
18 a motion picture theater. 
19 2. It establishes a new crime of organized retail theft. Organized retail theft is 
20 defined as a theft in which a person conspires with one or more other persons, either as a 
21 principal or as an accomplice, pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct to engage in 
22 theft from 2 or more retail stores for the purpose of selling the stolen merchandise or
