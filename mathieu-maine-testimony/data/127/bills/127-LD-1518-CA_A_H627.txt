39 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A" to H.P. 1043, L.D. 1518 
saving and medically necessary. The existence of a surrogate does not affect the ability 
of a minor to give consent as otherwise provided by law. Before the surrogate may give 
consent, the surrogate must make a reasonable good faith attempt to inform the minor's 
parents or legal guardian of the minor's need for health care and the parents' right to make 
those decisions. If parental notification is not required by other provisions of law, the 
surrogate is not required to inform or attempt to inform the minor's parents or legal 
guardian. 
2. Notice of health care received. Unless parental notification is not required by 
other provisions of law, a surrogate giving consent pursuant to subsection 1 shall make a 
reasonable good faith attempt to inform the minor's parents or legal guardian of the health 
care that the minor received. A health care practitioner or health care provider who 
provides health care pursuant to this section shall inform the minor's surrogate of this 
obligation. The sending of correspondence by regular mail, e-mail, texting, posting to a 
personal website or other written means of communication to the last known address or 
contacting by telephone using the last known telephone number of the minor's parents or 
legal guardian. whichever means the surrogate believes to be the most effective way to 
ensure actual notification, is deemed a reasonable good faith attempt to provide notice for 
purposes of this subsection. 
3. Penalties. The following penalties apply to violations of this section. 
A. A surrogate who makes decisions for a minor knowing that the decisions are 
prohibited by subsection 1 commits a Class E crime. 
B. A person who knowingly acts as a surrogate for a minor without meeting the 
definition of "surrogate" in section 1501, subsection 4 commits a Class E crime. 
C. A surrogate who fails to attempt to give notice as required in subsection 1 or 2 
commits a Class E crime. 
Sec. 3. 22 MRSA §1504, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. C, §8 and affected by 
Pt. E, §2, is repealed and the following enacted in its place: 
§1504. Good faith reliance on consent 
1. Reliance on minor's consent. A health care practitioner or health care provider 
who takes reasonable steps to ascertain that a minor is authorized to consent to health 
care as authorized in section 1503 and who subsequently renders health care in reliance 
on that consent is not liable for failing to have secured consent of the minor's parents or 
legal guardian prior to providing health care to the minor. 
2. Reliance on surrogate's consent. Recovery is not allowed against any health 
care practitioner or health care provider upon the grounds that the health care was 
rendered without informed consent if consent is given by the minor's surrogate pursuant 
to section 1503-A and the health care practitioner or provider acts with good faith 
reliance on that consent. 
Sec. 4. 22 MRSA §1507, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 90, §1, is amended to read:

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT .. [f.,, to H.P. 1043, L.D. 1518 
§1507. Consent for sexual assault forensic examination 
2 Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in section 1503 or the existence of a 
3 surrogate described in section 1503-A, a minor may consent to health services associated 
4 with a sexual assault forensic examination to collect evidence after an alleged sexual 
5 assault.' 
6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment replaces the bill. Unlike the bill, which authorizes a "caretaker 
8 relative" to make medical and educational decisions for a minor, this amendment 
9 addresses only the issues related to health care for minors. 
10 This amendment makes changes to the laws governing minors' authority to consent to 
11 health care by identifying situations in which adults who voluntarily and without specific 
12 legal authority through a power of attorney or appointment as a legal guardian provide 
13 care that a parent normally would. This amendment recognizes that when parents are 
14 temporarily absent from a minor's life, certain adults with whom a minor resides may 
15 assume a surrogate role. As defined in the amendment, a surrogate may not be a parent, 
16 legal guardian or an adult to whom a parent has given a power of attorney authorizing 
17 health care treatment for the minor. Surrogates may include an adult related to a minor 
18 by blood, marriage or adoption and from whom the minor receives the ongoing care and 
19 support expected of a parent. If no such relatives exist, an adult with whom the minor 
20 resides and who has provided the minor with the ongoing care and support expected of a 
21 parent may act as a surrogate. The existence of a surrogate does not remove the ability of 
22 a minor to give consent under any other existing law. 
23 If a minor needs health care, a surrogate must make a good faith attempt to notify the 
24 minor's parents or legal guardian of their right to make those decisions unless parental 
25 notification is not required by other provisions of law. Absent a response, the surrogate 
26 may make most health care decisions on behalf of the minor without parental consent. A 
27 surrogate may not make decisions withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments 
28 or denying consent for treatments that are life-saving and medically necessary. A 
29 surrogate giving consent on behalf of the minor must attempt to make a good faith effort 
30 to notify the absent parents or legal guardian of any health care received by the minor 
31 unless parental notification is not required by other provisions of law. 
32 Health care practitioners and providers may rely on the consent given by the 
33 surrogate. If they do so, they are immune from liability for providing treatment without 
34 receiving informed consent from the parents or legal guardian. Health care practitioners 
35 and providers must inform the surrogate of the surrogate's obligation to notify the minor's 
36 parents or legal guardian about the minor's treatment. 
37 This amendment allows the surrogate to use the means of communication the 
3 8 surrogate believes is the most effective way to ensure actual notification of the parents or 
39 legal guardian. The means of communication may be regular mail, e-mail, texting, 
40 personal website posting or other written means of communication to the last known 
41 address or contacting by telephone using the last known telephone number of the absent 
42 parents or legal guardian.

COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A "to H.P. 1043, L.D. 1518 
1 This amendment provides that a surrogate who makes health care decisions for the 
2 minor knowing that those specific decisions may not be made by the surrogate or without 
3 attempting to contact the parents or legal guardian about the need for the health care or 
4 the health care received commits a Class E crime. A person who makes health care 
5 decisions for a minor when not qualified as a surrogate is guilty of a Class E crime. 
6 This amendment provides that, as long as the health care practitioner or provider acts 
7 with good faith reliance on the consent of the surrogate, there is no liability against the 
8 health care practitioner or provider on the grounds that the health care treatment was 
9 rendered without informed consent. 
10 This amendment clarifies that a minor may consent to health services associated with 
11 a sexual assault forensic examination to collect evidence after an alleged sexual assault 
12 regardless of whether a surrogate exists.
