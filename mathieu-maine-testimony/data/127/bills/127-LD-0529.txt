crossing in a manner so that the operator will be able to stop if necessary.  The operator 28 
must stop the vehic le not less than 15 feet and not more than 50 feet from the nearest rail 29 
of the railroad track and may not proceed until the operator may do so safely if a clearly 30

gate is lowered or a flagger gives or continues to give a signal or warning of the approach 32 
or passage of a train; a train is visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing; or a 33
