This amendment restores the emergency preamble and clause, keeps the requirement that the Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS) amend its rules so that the cost of continuing education for direct care staff is included 
as a direct care cost component rather than a routine cost component and strikes everything else. All appropriations, 
allocations and revenue impacts are reversed. As amended, the remaining fiscal impact from the rule change is a 
minor cost to DHHS that can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
