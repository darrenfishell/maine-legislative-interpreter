162, subsection 6, this Part may not be construed to affect the term of a person appointed 13

Librarian or a director of  a nonpartisan staff office before October 1, 2015.  15 
SUMMARY  16 
This bill makes changes to the statutes governing the Legislature.  17 
It clarifies that the floor leaders and assistants are from the 2 political parties with the 18 
greatest number of members in each b ody.  It also removes the current requirement that 19 
the Legislative Council meet at least monthly when the Legislature is not in session.  20 
Instead, this bill allows the chair of the Legislative Council to cancel a meeting when the 21 
Legislature is not in sess ion if the chair determines that a meeting is not necessary.  It 22 
retains the ability of the chair of the Legislative Council or the membership of the 23 
Legislative Council to call a meeting.  24 
Current law provides that the Executive Director of the Legislative  Council, the State 25 
Law Librarian and other nonpartisan office directors appointed by the Legislative Council 26 
are appointed to 3 -year terms and that reappointment "shall be based on performance in 27 
the office"; that language is open to different interpretat ions.  The bill removes the 28 
element of the 3 -year term and specifies that the executive director, the State Law 29 
Librarian and other nonpartisan office directors serve at the pleasure of the Legislative 30 
Council.  It also specifies that both the appointment and the removal of the executive 31 
director, the State Law Librarian and other nonpartisan office directors must be by a vote 32 
of no fewer than 8 members of the Legislative Council.  33 
It repeals a transition section for persons holding certain named positions i n 34 
legislative staff offices in 1985 that no longer exist, making the law unnecessary.  35 
It specifies that the executive director coordinates the activities of the nonpartisan 36 
legislative staff offices.  37 
Current law specifies that a duty of the executive direc tor is to appoint nonpartisan 38 
legislative staff; by delegating the authority to officially appoint staff, the Legislative 39 
Council is not itself required to officially appoint each staff member.  The bill specifies 40 
 
 Page 6 - 127LR0171(01) -1 
 that the appointments must be done in conf ormity with the policies adopted by the 1 
Legislative Council and further specifies that the appointing authority of the executive 2 
director applies only to nonpartisan legislative staff.  3 
Although the term "legislative staff" is used a number of times in the Maine Revised 4 
Statutes, Title 3, chapter 7, the term is not defined to indicate that it is limited to 5 
nonpartisan legislative staff when describing the duties of the nonpartisan staff offices 6 
and the executive director.  The bill corrects that.  7 
It removes outdated and duplicative language regarding the updating of the Maine 8 
Revised Statutes, which is already required by the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 1, 9 
section 92.  10 
It removes a reference to a committee that no longer exists and standardizes the 11 
reference  to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over 12 
appropriations and financial affairs.  13 
It specifies that the directors and staff of the Law and Legislative Reference Library, 14 
the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accou ntability and the Office of 15 
Legislative Information Technology are subject to the same restrictions regarding 16 
testifying before legislative committees as the members of the other nonpartisan staff 17 
offices of the Legislature.  18 
It removes outdated language re garding the printing of the Laws of the State of 19 
Maine, also referred to as the session laws, but retains and clarifies the language 20 
regarding a revision of the entire Maine Revised Statutes.  21 
It removes an outdated provision regarding reporting by the Main e Human Rights 22 
Commission.  23 
It changes the wording of the statutes regarding the receipt by the executive director 24 
of reports from boards and commissions to clarify that the executive director merely 25 
forwards the report to the appropriate joint standing com mittee, instead of referring it, 26 
since "refer" has a specific meaning in the Legislature.  27 
It specifies that the term of a person appointed to a 3 -year term as the executive 28 
director, the State Law Librarian or a director of a nonpartisan staff office of th e 29 
Legislature before October 1, 2015 is not affected by the bill's removal of that specified 30 
term.  31 
It makes other nonsubstantive changes to grammar and format.  32
