amended to read:  3 
B-3.  "Renewable capacity resource" means a source of electrical generation:  4 
(1)  Whose total power  production capacity does not exceed 100 megawatts and 5 
relies on one or more of the following:  6 
(a)  Fuel cells;  7 
(b)  Tidal power;  8 
(c)  Solar arrays and installations;  9 
(d)  Geothermal installations;  10 
(e)  Hydroelectric generators that meet all state and fede ral fish passage 11 
requirements applicable to the generator; or  12 
(f)  Biomass generators that are fueled by wood or wood waste, landfill gas 13 
or anaerobic digestion of agricultural products, by -products or wastes ; or 14 
(2)  That relies on wind power installatio ns. 15 
Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3602, sub -§3-A is enacted to read:  16 
3-A.  Net generating capacity.  "Net generating capacity" means the output of a 17 
generating facility delivered to the transmission and distribution utility system excluding 18 
any generation consumed b y the generator for internal or on -site use.  19 
Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3603, sub -§2, ¶¶A and B, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 329, 20 
Pt. A, §4, are amended to read:  21 
A.  The installed  net generating capacity of a program participant may not exceed 10 22 
megawatts.  23 
B.  The total installed  net generating capacity of all program participants combined 24 
may not exceed 50 megawatts.  25 
Sec. 4.  Community -based renewable energy pilot program projects.  26 
Notwithstanding the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35 -A, section 3609, a community - 27 
based renewable energy project that has been certified by the Public Utilities Commission 28 
by December 31, 2015 as a program participant under the community -based renewable 29 
energy pilot program established in Title 35 -A, section 3603 remains authorized to 30 
operate as a program participant as long as the program participant continues to take 31 
reasonable steps to develop and operate the project as determined by the commission.  32 
SUMMARY  33 
This bill allows biomass generators that are fueled by any type of anaerobic 34 
digestion, instead of anaerobic digestion of agricultural products, by -products and wastes 35 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1683(01) -1 
 only, as a new renewable capacity resource under the electricity generation supply source 1 
portfolio requirements.  2 
The bill specifies that the basis to be used for det ermining capacity under the 3 
community -based renewable energy pilot program is net generating capacity, rather than 4 
installed generating capacity.  It also provides that projects authorized and certified by the 5 
Public Utilities Commission before December 31 , 2015 retain those approvals as long as 6 
the project continues to develop and operate.  7
