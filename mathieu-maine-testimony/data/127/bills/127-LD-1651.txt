Potential current biennium revenue decrease - Other Special Revenue Funds
The bill requires that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) not assess any large volume customer of a gas utility or 
make any final decision regarding the appropriateness or size of assessments on large volume customers until 90 days 
after adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 128th Legislature in fiscal year 2017-18. Large volume 
customers are not currently being assessed by the PUC. Any revenue, if they were to be assessed, would be transferred 
to the Efficiency Maine Trust by the PUC. No estimate is made at this time on whether and at what rate they would be 
assessed. The bill also exempts wholesale electricity-generating facilities having a nameplate capacity of 3 megawatts 
or greater from assessments. No estimate is made at this time on the potential revenue loss from exempting these 
wholesale electricity-generating facilities.127th MAINE LEGISLATURE
