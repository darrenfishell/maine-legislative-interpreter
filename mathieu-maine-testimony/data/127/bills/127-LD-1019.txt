than $1,000. For each taxable item with a sale price greater than $1,000 but no more 
than $5,000, the actual use tax liability for each purchase must be added to the amount 
of the estimated liability derived from the use tax table. Upon subsequent review, if use 
tax liability for the period of the return exceeds the amount of use tax paid with the 
return, a credit of that amount paid relative to the item or items being supplementarily 
assessed is allowed. Use tax on any it em with a sale price of more than $5,000 must be

association with the replacement registration.   The amount of the credit is equal to the 
amount of the excise tax paid in order to register the original vehicle multiplied by a 
fraction, the numera tor of which is the number of complete months short of 12 
months during which the registration was surrendered and the denominator is 12; or

amount of tax for decedents dying during calendar year 2016 is determined as provided 
in this section.  
 
A. If the M aine taxable estate is $5,500,000 or less, the tax is $0.  
 
B. If the Maine taxable estate is more than $5,500,000 but no more than $8,000,000, 
the tax is 10% of the excess over $5,500,000.  
 
C. If the Maine taxable estate is more than $8,000,000, the tax is  $250,000 plus 12% 
of the excess over $8,000,000.  
 
The amount of tax is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of that 
portion of the decedent’s adjusted federal gross estate that consists of real and tangible 
personal property locat ed in the State plus the value of all intangible personal property 
and the denominator of which is the value of the decedent’s adjusted federal gross 
estate.  
 
SUMMARY  
PART J  
This Part eliminates the Maine estate tax for decedents dying on or after January 1, 
2017.  The exclusion amount for estates of decedents dying in calendar year 2016 is 
increased from $2 million to $5.5 million, the amount estimated to be the federal exclusion 
amount for the estates of 2016 decedents.  The tax rate schedule for 2016 dec edents is 
updated to reflect the increase in the exclusion amount.

Sec. BB-7. 36 MRSA, §578, sub -§1, ¶¶ D and E , are enacted to read:  
1. Organized areas.   The municipal assessors or chief assessor of a primary assessing 
area shall adjust the State Tax Assessor's 100% valuation per acre for each forest type of their  
county by whatever ratio, or percentage of current just value, is applied  to other property 
within the municipality to obtain the assessed values. Forest land in the organized areas, 
subject to taxation under this subchapter, must be taxed at the property tax rate applicable to 
other property in the municipality.  
The State Tax Assessor shall determine annually the amount of acreage in each municipality 
that is classified and taxed in accordance with this subchapter. Each municipality is entitled 
to annual payments distributed in accordance with this section from money appropriat ed by 
the Legislature if it submits an annual return in accordance with section 383 and if it achieves 
the minimum assessment ratio established in section 327. The State Tax Assessor shall pay 
any municipal claim found to be in satisfactory form by August 1st of the year following the 
submission of the annual return. The municipal reimbursement appropriation is calculated on

tax years based on the status of proper ty on April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2009, municipal 
reimbursement under this section is further limited to the amount appropriated by the 
Legislature and distributed on a pro rata basis by the State Tax Assessor for all timely filed 
claims. For purposes of th is section, "classified forest lands" means forest lands classified 
pursuant to this subchapter as well as all areas identified as forested land within farmland 
parcels that are transferred from tree growth classification pursuant to section 1112 on or 
after October 1, 2011. For the purposes of this section, the tax lost is the tax that would have 
been assessed, but for this subchapter, on the classified forest lands if they were assessed 
according to the undeveloped acreage valuations used in the state val uation then in effect, or 
according to the current local valuation on undeveloped acreage, whichever is less, minus the 
tax that was actually assessed on the same lands in accordance with this subchapter, and 
adjusted for the aggregate municipal savings in  required educational costs attributable to 
reduced state valuation. A municipality that fails to achieve the minimum assessment ratio 
established in section 327 loses 10% of the reimbursement provided by this section for each 
one percentage point the mini mum assessment ratio falls below the ratio established in 
section 327.  
The State Tax Assessor shall adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions of this 
section. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules for the purposes 
of Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2 -A. 
A.   
B.   
C. The State Tax Assessor shall distribute reimbursement under this section to each 
municipality in proportion to the product of the reduced tree growth valuation of the

(3) "Average value of undeveloped land" means the per acre undevelope d land 
valuations used in the state valuation then in effect, or according to the current local 
valuation on undeveloped land as determined for state valuation purposes, whichever 
is less.  
(4) "Reduced tree growth valuation" means the difference between th e average value 
of undeveloped land and the average value of tree growth land times the total 
number of acres classified as forest land under this subchapter plus the total number 
of acres of forest land that is transferred from tree growth classification to farmland 
classification pursuant to section 1112 on or after October 1, 2011.  
D.  The State Tax Assessor  shall reduce reimbursement for one year to a 
municipality that fails to file a timely report to the Bureau of Forestry as required 
pursuant to sect ion 581 -G.  The amount of reduction shall be equal to $5,000 or 10% 
of the reimbursement, whichever is greater . 
E.  The State Tax Assessor shall reduce reimbursement for one year to a municipality 
that fails to act in a timely manner upon a determination p rovided by the Bureau of

subject to valuation under this subchapter, to the assessor upon a form prescribed  by the State 
Tax Assessor, identifying the land to be valued under this subchapter, listing the number of 
acres of each forest type, showing the location of each forest type and representing that the 
land is used primarily for the growth of trees to be ha rvested for commercial use. Those 
schedules may be required at such other times as the assessor may designate upon 120 days' 
written notice.  
The assessor shall determine whether the land is subject to valuation and taxation under 
this subchapter and shall classify the land as to forest type.  
The assessor , or the assessor's duly authorized representative , or licensed foresters in the 
employ of the Bureau of Forestry  may enter and examine the forest lands under this 
subchapter and may examine any information submitted by the owner or owners. A copy of

agent of the owner. A forest management and harvest plan provi ded in accordance with this 
section is confidential and is not a public record as defined in Title 1, section 402, subsection 
3.  
Upon notice in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by another method 
that provides actual notice, any owne r or owners shall appear before the assessor, at such 
reasonable time and place as the assessor may designate and answer questions or 
interrogatories the assessor considers necessary to obtain material information about those 
lands.  
If the owner or owners of any parcel of forest land subject to valuation under this 
subchapter fails to submit the schedules as provided under this section or fails to provide 
information after notice duly received as provided under this section, such owner or owners 
are deemed to have waived all rights of appeal pursuant to section 583 for that property tax 
year, except for the determination that the land is subject to valuation under this subchapter.  
It is the obligation of the owner or owners to report to the assessor any chan ge of use or 
change of forest type of land subject to valuation under this subchapter.  
If the owner or owners fail to report to the assessor a change of use as required by the 
foregoing paragraph, the assessor shall assess the taxes that should have been p aid, shall 
assess the penalty provided in section 581 and shall assess an additional penalty equal to 25% 
of the penalty provided in section 581. The assessor may waive the additional penalty for 
cause.  
For the purposes of this section, the acts of owners specified in this section may be taken 
by an authorized agent of an owner.  
Sec. BB-9. 36 MRSA, §581, sub -§1, as amended  by PL 200 9, c. 577, §1, is further amended 
to read : 
1. Assessor determination; owner request.  If the assessor  or the Bureau of Forestry  
determines that land subject to this subchapter no longer meets the requirements of this 
subchapter, the assessor must withdraw the land from taxation under this subchapter.  The 
Bureau of Forestry must notify the assessor, the State Tax Assessor, and the  landowner in 
writing of its determination.  An owner of land subject to taxation under this subchapter may 
at any time request withdrawal of that land from taxation under this subchapter by certifying 
in writing to the assessor that the land is no longer to be classified under this subchapter.  
Sec. BB-10. 36 MRSA, §581, sub -§7, as repealed and replaced by PL 2007, c. 627, §16, is 
91 
 further amended to read : 
7. Reclassification as farmland or open space land.  A penalty may not be assessed 
upon the withdrawal of land from taxation under this subchapter if the owner applies for 
classification of that land as farmland or open space land under subchapter 10 and that 
application is accepted.  If the withdrawal occu rs as a result of a finding of noncompliance 
with the requirements of this subchapter, a penalty may be assessed. The penalty is an 
amount equal to the taxes that would have been assessed on the first day of April for the 10 
tax years, or any lesser number  of tax years starting with the year in which the land was first 
classified, preceding the withdrawal had that land been assessed in each of those years at its 
value as farmland or open space land on the date of withdrawal. That amount must be 
reduced by a ll taxes paid on that land over the preceding 10 years, or any lesser number of 
tax years starting with the year in which the land was first classified, and increased by 
interest at the prevailing municipal rate from the date or dates on which those amount s would 
have been payable.  If a penalty is later assessed under section 1112, the period of time that 
the land was taxed as forest land under this subchapter is included for purposes of

SUMMARY  
PART BB 
This Part does the following:  
1. Amends the definition of forest management and harvest plan as proposed in  the Maine 
Forest Service  2014 report to the Taxation Committee (both Tree Growth and Open 
Space Laws).  
2. Requires landowners to have access to their forest management and harvest plans as 
proposed in the Maine Forest Service  2014 report to the Taxation Committee.  
3. Requires a sworn statement from a licensed forester that the landowner is following their 
plan.  Currently, landowner is required to swear; the forester is not.  This will improve 
forester compliance.  
4. Gives the Maine Forest Service  the authority to require landowners to su bmit plans 
directly to the Maine Forest Service  for review, and to allow the Maine Forest Service  to 
inspect properties for compliance.  
5. Repeals the Maine Forest Service  audit sunset date.  
6. Authorizes the State Tax Assessor to reduce a municipality’s Tree Gr owth 
reimbursement for one year if:  (1) the town fails to timely file its Tree Growth 
information with the Maine Forest Service  as required by law; and, (2) the town fails to 
timely act upon recommendations by  the Maine Forest Service  regarding a landowner’s
