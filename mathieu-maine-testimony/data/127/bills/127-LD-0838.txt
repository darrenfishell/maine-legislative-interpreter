distribution in accordance with this subsection must be distributed to all  commercial 25 
tracks , except a commercial track whose parent company is owned or operated or owned 26

SUMMARY  3 
This bill adjusts the distribution of commissions on simulcasting of races with 4 
commingled pools originating at a racetrack in another state by an off -track betting 5 
facility without reducing the portion of those revenues that benefit  the State.  In addition, 6 
the bill eliminates the off -track betting facility simulcast fund share received by a 7 
commercial track whose parent company is owned or operated or owned and operated by 8 
a casino in this State.  The bill also modifies the requirem ent that an off -track betting 9 
facility operator be a liquor license holder, but maintains the requirement that an off -track 10 
betting facility be situated in a facility that is licensed to serve liquor and food.  The bill 11 
also eliminates the requirement for at least 150 race dates in the preceding 2 calendar 12 
years before interstate simulcasting or the licensing of an off -track betting facility is 13 
allowed.  14
