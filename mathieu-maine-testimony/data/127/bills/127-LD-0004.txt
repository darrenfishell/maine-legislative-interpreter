that is grown or possessed by a licensed grower in compliance with this chapter. 7 
2.  Growing permitted.   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person may 8 
plant, grow, harvest, possess, process, sell and buy industrial hemp if that person holds a 9 
license issued pursuant to subsection 4.  A person licensed pursuant to subsection 4 may 10 
plant, grow and harvest only hemp that is grown from seeds acquired from an approved 11 
Canadian producer of hemp seeds. A person licensed pursuant to subsection 4 may 12 
acquire hemp seeds directly from a producer in Canada or from a hemp seed distributor 13 
licensed in this State distributing hemp seeds pursuant to subsection 2- A. 14

distributor if the hemp seeds distributed by the hemp seed distributor are from an 16

criminal history record check are the responsibility of the applicant and must be 32 
submitted with the fingerprints. Criminal history records provided to the commissioner 33 
under this section are confidential. The results of criminal records checks received under 34 
this subsection may only be used in determining an applicant's eligibility for licensure. A 35 
person with a prior criminal conviction is not eligible for licensure. 36 
4.  License issued.    Upon review and approval of an application, the commissioner 37 
shall notify the applicant and request that the application fee determined under subsection 38

SUMMARY 24 
This bill removes the requirements that an applicant for an initial license to grow 25 
industrial hemp for commercial purposes must submit a set of the applicant's fingerprints 26 
and file with the Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry documentation 27 
indicating that the seeds planted were a type and variety of hemp approved by the 28 
commissioner and also repeals the provision that licensure is contingent upon action by 29 
the Federal Government. 30 
The bill requires that any hemp seeds acquired for cultivation of hemp in the State 31 
must come from an approved Canadian producer of hemp seeds.  It allows the 32 
Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to issue licenses for hemp seed 33 
distribution to holders of seed labeling licenses.  It also allows hemp growers licensed by 34 
the State to acquire hemp seeds directly from a producer in Canada or from a state- 35 
licensed hemp seed distributor.  It requires that application fees and license fees must be 36 
established by major substantive rules.  It includes an appropriations and allocations 37 
section. 38
