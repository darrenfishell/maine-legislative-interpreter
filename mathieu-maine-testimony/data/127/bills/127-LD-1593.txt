program to control the population of an animal.  22

of on state -owned land an animal killed by the department.  25 
4. It requires the commissioner to develop a landowner depredation program that sets 26 
a limit on the number of anim als that may be retained by the landowner and requires a 27 
landowner to donate any animal taken from that landowner's land for depredation 28 
purposes exceeding the limit established by the commissioner to the Hunters for the 29 
Hungry program.  30
