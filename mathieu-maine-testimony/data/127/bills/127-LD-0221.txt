SUMMARY  13 
This bill amends the laws regarding h ousing accommodations for individuals using 14 
service animals.  It exempts a landlord from having to comply with provisions concerning 15 
service animals when the landlord has requested from an individual seeking an 16 
accommodation a letter written by a licensed health care professional or social worker 17 
that sets out details about the service animal and why the individual seeking the 18 
accommodation needs the service animal if the landlord has not received that letter within 19 
a reasonable period of time.  It creates a presumption within the laws regarding forcible 20 
entry and detainer that a landlord does not have to make an accommodation for a service 21 
animal when the service animal's owner fails to comply with a set of requirements, 22 
including insurance coverage, sanita tion and public safety.  It allows a landlord to charge 23 
higher rent and higher security deposits and to require renter's insurance for an individual 24 
with a service animal.  It also changes the law concerning rentals of one -family units in 2 - 25 
family dwelling s exempted from the requirements of the Maine Human Rights Act by 26 
extending the exemption to rentals of one -family units in dwellings for 4 families or 27 
fewer.  28
