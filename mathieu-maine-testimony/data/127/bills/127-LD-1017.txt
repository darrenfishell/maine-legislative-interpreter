pendency of a proceeding under section 1867 or 1868 to rescind or challenge an 26 
acknowledgment of paternity or denial of parentage, the court may not suspend the legal 27 
responsibilities of a signatory arising from the acknowledgment, including the duty to pay 28 
child support.  29 
4.  Proceeding to rescind or challenge.  A proceeding under sect ion 1867 or 1868 to 30 
rescind or challenge an acknowledgment of paternity or denial of parentage must be 31 
conducted as a proceeding to adjudicate parentage under subchapter 1.  32 
5.  Amendment to birth record.  At the conclusion of a proceeding under section 33 
1867 or 1868 to rescind or challenge an acknowledgment of paternity or denial of 34 
parentage, the court shall order the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to amend the birth 35 
record of the child, if appropriate.  36 
§1870.  Ratification not permitted  37 
A court or adm inistrative agency conducting a judicial or administrative proceeding 38 
may not ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of paternity under section 1861.  39

SUBCHAPTER 4  13 
PRESUMED PARENTAGE  14 
§1881.  Presumption of parentage  15 
1.  Marital presumpti on established.  A person is presumed to be the parent of a 16 
child if:  17 
A.  The person and the woman giving birth to the child are married to each other and 18 
the child is born during the marriage;  19 
B.  The person and the woman giving birth to the child were ma rried to each other 20 
and the child is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, 21 
annulment, divorce or declaration of invalidity or after a decree of separation; or  22 
C.  Before the birth of the child, the person and the woman giving birt h to the child 23 
married each other in apparent compliance with law, even if the attempted marriage 24 
is or could be declared invalid, and the child is born during the invalid marriage or 25 
within 300 days after its termination by death, annulment, divorce or de claration of 26 
invalidity or after a decree of separation.  27 
2.  Equivalent status in other jurisdictions.  The marital presumption in subsection 28 
1 applies to a legal relationship that provides substantially the same rights, benefits and 29 
responsibilities as ma rriage and is recognized as valid in the state or jurisdiction in which 30 
it was entered.  31 
3.  Nonmarital presumption established.  A person is presumed to be a parent of a 32 
child if the person resided in the same household with the child and openly held out t he 33 
child as that person's own from the time the child was born or adopted and for a period of 34 
at least 2 years thereafter and assumed personal, financial or custodial responsibilities for 35 
the child.  36 
 
 Page 13 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 4.  Rebuttal of presumption.  A presumption established u nder this subchapter may 1 
be rebutted only by a court determination.  2 
§1882.  Challenge to presumed parent  3 
1.  Two -year limitation.  Except as provided in subsection 2, a proceeding to 4 
challenge the parentage of an individual whose parentage is presumed unde r section 1881 5 
must be commenced not later than 2 years after the birth of the child; otherwise the 6 
presumption cannot be rebutted.  7 
2.  Later than 2 years.  A proceeding to challenge the parentage of an individual 8 
whose parentage is presumed under section 1881 may be commenced more than 2 years 9 
after the birth of the child in the following situations.  10 
A.  A presumed parent under section 1881, subsection 1 who is not the genetic parent 11 
of a child and who could not reasonably have known about the birth of the  child may 12 
commence a proceeding under this subsection within 2 years after learning of the 13 
child's birth.  14 
B.  An alleged genetic parent who did not know of the potential genetic parentage of 15 
a child, and who could not reasonably have known on account of m aterial 16 
misrepresentation or concealment, may commence a proceeding under this subsection 17 
within 2 years after discovering the potential genetic parentage.  If the individual is 18 
adjudicated to be the genetic parent of the child, the court may not disestabl ish a 19 
presumed parent and, consistent with section 1853, subsection 2, the court shall 20 
determine parental rights and responsibilities of the parents in accordance with 21 
section 1653.  22 
C.  A mother or a presumed parent under section 1881, subsection 3 disputi ng the 23 
validity of the presumption may commence a proceeding under this subsection at any 24 
time.  25 
§1883.  Multiple presumptions  26 
If 2 or more conflicting presumptions arise under this subchapter, the court shall 27 
adjudicate parentage and determine parental rig hts and responsibilities in accordance with 28 
section 1653.  29 
SUBCHAPTER 5  30 
DE FACTO PARENTAGE  31 
§1891.  De facto parentage  32 
1.  De facto parentage.  The court may adjudicate a person to be a de facto parent.  33 
2.  Standing to seek de facto parentage.  A person seek ing to be adjudicated a de 34 
facto parent of a child under this subchapter must establish standing to maintain the 35 
action in accordance with the following.  36 
A.  A person seeking to be adjudicated a de facto parent of a child shall file with the 37 
initial pleadi ngs an affidavit alleging under oath specific facts to support the 38 
 
 Page 14 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 existence of a de facto parent relationship with the child as set forth in subsection 3.  1 
The pleadings and affidavit must be served upon all parents and legal guardians of 2 
the child and an y other party to the proceeding.  3 
B.  An adverse party, parent or legal guardian who files a pleading in response to the 4 
pleadings in paragraph A shall also file an affidavit in response, serving all parties to 5 
the proceeding with a copy.  6 
C.  The court shal l determine on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits under 7 
paragraphs A and B whether the person seeking to be adjudicated a de facto parent 8 
has presented prima facie evidence of the requirements set forth in subsection 3.  The 9 
court may in its sole di scretion, if necessary and on an expedited basis, hold a hearing 10 
to determine disputed facts that are necessary and material to the issue of standing.  11 
D.  If the court's determination under paragraph C is in the affirmative, the party 12 
claiming de facto par entage has standing to proceed to adjudication under subsection 13 
3. 14 
3.  Adjudication of de facto parent status.  The court shall adjudicate a person to be 15 
a de facto parent if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person has 16 
fully and co mpletely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed and responsible 17 
parental role in the child's life. Such a finding requires a determination by the court that:  18 
A.  The person has resided with the child for a significant period of time;  19 
B.  The person  has engaged in consistent caretaking of the child;  20 
C.  A bonded and dependent relationship has been established between the child and 21 
the person, the relationship was fostered or supported by another parent of the child 22 
and the person and the other parent  have understood, acknowledged or accepted that 23 
or behaved as though the person is a parent of the child;  24 
D.  The person has accepted full and permanent responsibilities as a parent of the 25 
child without expectation of financial compensation; and  26 
E.  The co ntinuing relationship between the person and the child is in the best interest 27 
of the child.  28 
4.  Orders.  The court may enter the following orders as appropriate.  29 
A.  The court may enter an interim order concerning contact between a person with 30 
standing se eking adjudication under this subchapter as a de facto parent and the child.  31 
B.  Adjudication of a person under this subchapter as a de facto parent establishes 32 
parentage, and the court shall determine parental rights and responsibilities in 33 
accordance wit h section 1653.  The court shall make appropriate orders for the 34 
financial support for the child in accordance with the child support guidelines under 35 
chapter 63.  An order requiring the payment of support to or from a de facto parent 36 
does not relieve any other parent of the obligation to pay child support unless 37 
otherwise ordered by a court.  38 
5.  Other parents.  The adjudication of a person under this subchapter as a de facto 39 
parent does not disestablish the parentage of any other parent.  40

 SUBCHAPTER 6  1 
GENET IC PARENTAGE  2 
§1901.  Scope of subchapter  3 
This subchapter governs procedures and requirements of genetic testing and genetic 4 
testing results of an individual to determine parentage and adjudication of parentage 5 
based on genetic testing, whether the individu al voluntarily submits to testing or is tested 6 
pursuant to an order of the court or the department.  7 
§1902.  Requirements for genetic testing  8 
1.  Type of genetic testing.  Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied upon 9 
by experts in the field of g enetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited 10 
by: 11 
A.  A national association of blood banks approved by the department; or  12 
B.  An accrediting body designated by the federal Secretary of Health and Human 13 
Services.  14 
2.  Specimen.  A specimen  used in genetic testing may consist of one or more 15 
samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair or other body 16 
tissue or fluid.  The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each 17 
individual undergoing geneti c testing.  18 
3.  Selection of databases; objections.  Based on the genetic population group of an 19 
individual, a testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select 20 
frequencies for use in calculation of the probability of genetic parentage.  If there is 21 
disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the following provisions apply.  22 
A.  The court, upon motion, may require the testing laboratory, prior to adjudication, 23 
to recalculate the test results using a different database for genetic p opulation groups 24 
from that used by the laboratory.  25 
B.  The individual objecting to the testing laboratory's initial choice shall:  26 
(1)  If the frequencies are not available to the testing laboratory for the genetic 27 
population groups requested, provide the r equested frequencies compiled in a 28 
manner recognized by an accrediting body under subsection 1; or  29 
(2)  Engage another accredited testing laboratory to perform the calculations.  30 
C.  The testing laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question 31 
regarding which database for genetic population groups is appropriate.  The testing 32 
laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if available, for any other 33 
database requested.  34 
4.  Additional genetic testing.  If, after recalculati on under subsection 3 using a 35 
different database for genetic population groups, genetic testing does not rebuttably 36 
identify the genetic parent of a child under section 1904, an individual who has been 37 
tested may be required to submit to additional genetic  testing.  38 
 
 Page 16 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 §1903.  Report of genetic testing  1 
1.  Report; self -authenticating.  A report of genetic testing must be in a record and 2 
signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing laboratory. A report made 3 
under the requirements of this subchapt er is self -authenticating.  4 
2.  Documentation.  Documentation from the testing laboratory of the following 5 
information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody that allows the results of 6 
genetic testing to be admissible without testimony:  7 
A.  The names and photographs of the individuals whose specimens have been taken;  8 
B.  The names of the individuals who collected the specimens;  9 
C.  The places and dates the specimens were collected;  10 
D.  The names of the individuals who received the specimens i n the testing 11 
laboratory; and  12 
E.  The dates the specimens were received.  13 
§1904.  Genetic testing results  14 
1.  Results identify as genetic parent.  Under this chapter, a person is rebuttably 15 
identified as the genetic parent of a child if the genetic testing of the person complies with 16 
this subchapter and the results disclose:  17 
A.  In the case of paternity:  18 
(1)  That the man has at least a 99% probability of paternity, using a prior 19 
probability of 0.50, as calculated by using the paternity index obtained in the  20 
testing; and  21 
(2)  A paternity index of at least 100 to 1; and  22 
B.  In the case of maternity:  23 
(1)  That the woman has at least a 99% probability of maternity, using a prior 24 
probability of at least 0.50, as calculated by using the maternity index obtained in  25 
the testing; and  26 
(2)  A maternity index of at least 100 to 1.  27 
2.  Identification of genetic parent.  Identification of a genetic parent through 28 
genetic testing does not establish parentage absent adjudication under this chapter.  29 
3.  Rebuttal.  A person i dentified under subsection 1 as the genetic father or genetic 30 
mother of the child may rebut the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing 31 
satisfying the requirements of this subchapter that:  32 
A.  Excludes the person as a genetic father or geneti c mother of the child; or  33 
B.  In the case of a genetic father, identifies another man as the possible genetic 34 
father of the child or, in the case of a genetic mother, identifies another woman as the 35 
possible genetic mother of the child.  36 
 
 Page 17 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 4.  Further genetic  testing.  Except as otherwise provided in section 1909, if more 1 
than one person is identified by genetic testing as the possible genetic father or genetic 2 
mother of the child, the court shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 3 
identify the  sole genetic father or genetic mother.  4 
§1905.  Costs of genetic testing  5 
1.  Payment for the costs advanced.  The payment for the costs, if any, of initial 6 
genetic testing must be advanced:  7 
A.  By the department in a proceeding in which the department is p roviding services;  8 
B.  By the individual who made the request;  9 
C.  As agreed by the parties; or  10 
D.  As ordered by the court.  11 
2.  Reimbursement.  In cases in which the payment for the costs of initial genetic 12 
testing is advanced pursuant to subsection 1, pa ragraph A, the department may seek 13 
reimbursement from a person who is rebuttably identified through the genetic testing as 14 
the genetic father or genetic mother.  15 
§1906.  Additional genetic testing  16 
The court shall order additional genetic testing upon the re quest of a party who 17 
contests the result of the initial testing.  If the initial genetic testing identified a person as 18 
the genetic father or genetic mother of the child under section 1904, the court or agency 19 
may not order additional testing unless the pa rty provides advance payment for the 20 
testing.  21 
§1907.  Genetic testing when specimens not available  22 
1.  Specimen not available; submission of specimens.  Subject to subsection 2, if a 23 
genetic testing specimen is not available from a person who may be the ge netic father or 24 
genetic mother of a child, for good cause and under circumstances the court considers to 25 
be just, the court may order the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic 26 
testing:  27 
A.  The parents of the person;  28 
B.  Brothers and sisters  of the person;  29 
C.  Other children of the person and their mothers; and  30 
D.  Relatives of the person necessary to complete genetic testing.  31 
2.  Finding required.  Issuance of an order under this section requires a finding that 32 
a need for genetic testing out weighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be 33 
tested.  34 
§1908.  Deceased person  35 
For good cause shown, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased person.  36 
 
 Page 18 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 §1909.  Identical sibling  1 
1.  Genetic testing of sibling.  The court may order ge netic testing of a sibling of a 2 
person if the person is commonly believed to have an identical sibling and evidence 3 
suggests that the sibling may be the genetic father or genetic mother of the child.  4 
2.  Nongenetic evidence.  If a person and a sibling of t he person tested pursuant to 5 
subsection 1 satisfy the requirements as the identified genetic father or genetic mother of 6 
the child under section 1904 without consideration of another identical sibling being 7 
identified as the genetic father or genetic mothe r of the child, the court may rely on 8 
nongenetic evidence to adjudicate parentage under this chapter.  9 
§1910.  Confidentiality of genetic testing  10 
1.  Release of report.  A report of genetic testing for parentage is confidential and 11 
may not be released excep t as provided in this subchapter.  12 
2.  Intentional release of identifiable specimen.  An individual who intentionally 13 
releases an identifiable specimen of another individual for any purpose other than that 14 
relevant to a proceeding regarding parentage withou t a court order or the written 15 
permission of the individual who furnished the specimen commits a Class E crime.  16 
§1911.  Court order for testing  17 
1.  Order to submit to genetic testing.  Except as provided in section 1912 or as 18 
otherwise provided in this cha pter, the court may order a child and other designated 19 
individuals to submit to genetic testing if the request for testing is supported by the sworn 20 
statement of a party to a proceeding setting forth a reasonable, good faith basis for 21 
alleging or denying g enetic parentage.  22 
2.  Presumption of genetic maternity.  Genetic testing of the woman who gave birth 23 
to a child is not required and may not be ordered to prove that she is the genetic mother, 24 
unless there is a reasonable, good faith basis to dispute geneti c maternity.  25 
3.  No presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated parent.  The department may seek 26 
an order for genetic testing only if there is no presumed parent, acknowledged father, 27 
adjudicated parent or intended parent who consented to assisted reproduction p ursuant to 28 
this chapter.  Genetic testing may not be ordered if the person who is the subject of the 29 
request for order is a donor.  30 
4.  In utero testing.  If a request for genetic testing of a child is made before birth, 31 
the court may not order in utero tes ting. 32 
5.  Concurrent or sequential testing.  If 2 or more individuals are subject to court - 33 
ordered genetic testing, the testing may be ordered concurrently or sequentially.  34 
 
 Page 19 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 §1912.  Authority to deny requested order for genetic testing or admission of test 1 
results  2 
1.  Grounds for denial.  In a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, the court may deny 3 
a motion seeking an order for genetic testing or deny admissibility of the test results at 4 
trial if the court determines that:  5 
A.  The conduct of the parties estop s a party from denying parentage; or  6 
B.  It would be an inequitable interference to the relationship between the child and a 7 
parent or otherwise contrary to the best interest of the child.  8 
2.  Factors.  In determining whether to deny a motion seeking an or der for genetic 9 
testing under this chapter or a request for admission of such test results at trial, the court 10 
shall consider the best interest of the child, including the following factors, if relevant:  11 
A.  The length of time between the proceeding to adj udicate parentage and the time 12 
that a parent was placed on notice that genetic parentage is at issue;  13 
B.  The length of time during which the parent has assumed a parental role for the 14 
child;  15 
C.  The facts surrounding discovery that genetic parentage is at  issue;  16 
D.  The nature of the relationship between the child and the parent;  17 
E.  The age of the child;  18 
F.  Any adverse effect on the child that may result if parentage is successfully 19 
disproved;  20 
G.  The nature of the relationship between the child and any alleged parent;  21 
H.  The extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the 22 
parentage of another person and a child support obligation in favor of the child; and  23 
I.  Factors in addition to those in paragraphs A to H that may affect the equities 24 
arising from the disruption of the relationship between the child and the parent or the 25 
chance of other adverse effect to the child.  26 
3.  Guardian ad litem.  In a proceeding involving the application of this section, a 27 
minor or incapacitated ch ild may be represented by a guardian ad litem.  28 
4.  Order.  In cases involving an acknowledged or presumed parent, if the court 29 
denies a motion seeking an order for genetic testing, the court shall issue an order 30 
adjudicating the acknowledged or presumed pa rent to be the parent of the child.  31 
§1913.  Admissibility of results of genetic testing; expenses  32 
1.  Record admissible; objection.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a 33 
record of a genetic testing expert is admissible as evidence of the truth o f the facts 34 
asserted in the report unless a party objects to its admission within 14 days after its 35 
receipt by the objecting party and cites specific grounds for exclusion.  The admissibility 36 
of the report is not affected by whether the testing was perform ed: 37 
 
 Page 20 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 A.  Voluntarily or pursuant to an order of the court; or  1 
B.  Before or after the commencement of the proceeding.  2 
2.  Testimony of experts.  A party objecting to the results of genetic testing may call 3 
one or more genetic testing experts to testify in p erson or by telephone, videoconference, 4 
deposition or another method approved by the court.  Unless otherwise ordered by the 5 
court, the party offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert's testifying.  6 
3.  Results inadmissible; exceptions.  If a child has a presumed parent, 7 
acknowledged father or adjudicated parent, the results of genetic testing are admissible to 8 
adjudicate parentage only:  9 
A.  With the consent of each person who is a parent of the child under this chapter, 10 
unless the court otherw ise orders under section 1912; or  11 
B.  Pursuant to an order of the court under section 1911.  12 
4.  Copies of bills and records as evidence.  Copies of bills and records of expenses 13 
paid for prenatal care, childbirth, postnatal care and genetic testing are adm issible as 14 
evidence without requiring 3rd -party foundation testimony and are prima facie evidence 15 
of amounts incurred for those expenses or testing on behalf of the child.  16 
§1914.  Consequences of declining genetic testing  17 
1.  Adjudication contrary to posit ion.  If an individual whose paternity is being 18 
determined under this chapter declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court, 19 
the court for that reason may adjudicate parentage contrary to the position of that 20 
individual.  21 
2.  Testing of woman g iving birth; unavailable or declines.  Genetic testing of the 22 
woman who gave birth to a child is not a condition precedent to testing the child and a 23 
man whose paternity is being determined under this chapter.  If the woman who gave 24 
birth is unavailable or  declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order the 25 
testing of the child and every person whose genetic parentage is being adjudicated.  26 
§1915.  Adjudication of parentage based on genetic testing  27 
1.  Parentage based on genetic testing.  If the c ourt adjudicates parentage based on 28 
genetic testing, the following apply.  29 
A.  Unless the results of genetic testing are admitted to rebut other results of genetic 30 
testing:  31 
(1)  If genetic testing results pursuant to section 1904 exclude a person as the 32 
genetic parent of a child, the court shall find that person is not a genetic parent of 33 
the child and may not adjudicate the person as the child's parent on the basis of 34 
genetic testing; and  35 
(2)  If genetic testing results pursuant to section 1904 identify a p erson as the 36 
genetic parent of a child, the court shall find that person to be the genetic parent 37 
 
 Page 21 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 and may adjudicate the person as the child's parent, unless otherwise provided by 1 
this chapter.  2 
B.  If the court finds that genetic testing under section 1904  neither identifies nor 3 
excludes a person as the genetic parent of a child, the court may not dismiss the 4 
proceeding.  In that event, the results of genetic testing and other evidence are 5 
admissible to adjudicate the issue of parentage.  6 
2.  Inadmissible ev idence.  Testimony relating to sexual relations or possible sexual 7 
relations of the woman giving birth at a time other than the probable time of conception 8 
of the child is inadmissible in evidence.  9 
3.  Adjudication consistent with this chapter.  An adjudic ation of parentage based 10 
on genetic testing is subject to the requirements and limitations of this chapter.  11 
SUBCHAPTER 7  12 
PARENTAGE BY ASSISTE D REPRODUCTION  13 
§1921.  Scope of subchapter  14 
This subchapter does not apply to the birth of a child conceived by mean s other than 15 
assisted reproduction.  16 
§1922.  Parental status of donor  17 
1.  Donor not a parent.  A donor is not a parent of a child conceived through 18 
assisted reproduction.  19 
2.  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding subsection 1:  20 
A.  A person who provides a gamete or g ametes or an embryo or embryos to be used 21 
for assisted reproduction for the person's spouse is a parent of the resulting child; and  22 
B.  A person who provides a gamete or gametes or an embryo or embryos for assisted 23 
reproduction is a parent of the resulting  child if the person has a written agreement or 24 
agreements with the person giving birth and any intended parent that the person will 25 
be a parent.  26 
§1923.  Parentage of child of assisted reproduction  27 
A person who provides gametes for and consents to or a per son who consents to 28 
assisted reproduction by a woman as provided in section 1924 with the intent to be the 29 
parent of a resulting child is a parent of the resulting child.  30 
§1924.  Consent to assisted reproduction  31 
1.  Written consent.  Consent by a person wh o intends to be a parent of a child born 32

intended parent and provides that the signatories consent to use of assisted reproduction 34 
to conceive a child with the inte nt to parent the child.  35 
 
 Page 22 - 127LR0310(01) -1 
 2.  Lack of written consent; parentage.  Failure of a person to sign a consent 1 
required by subsection 1 before or after birth of the child does not preclude a finding of 2 
parentage:  3 
A.  If consent can be proved by other means and the  consenting individual resided 4 
with the child after birth and undertook to develop a parental relationship with the 5 
child; or  6 
B.  As provided in this chapter.  7 
3.  Consent form.  Consent under subsection 1 executed via a consent form adopted 8 
by the Office o f Data, Research and Vital Statistics must be accepted and relied upon for 9 
purposes of issuing a birth record.  10 
§1925.  Challenge by spouse to consent  11 
1.  Challenge by spouse to consent.  The spouse of a person who gives birth to a 12 
child through assisted re production may challenge the spouse's own parentage of the child 13 
only if:  14 
A.  The spouse did not provide gametes or embryos for the assisted reproduction;  15 
B.  The spouse did not before or after the birth of the child consent to the assisted 16 
reproduction by  the person who gave birth;  17 
C.  The spouse and the person who gave birth to the child have not cohabitated since 18 
the time of the child's birth; and  19 
D.  The spouse did not openly hold out the child as the spouse's own.  20 
§1926.  Effect of dissolution of marri age or withdrawal of consent  21 
1.  Dissolution of marriage prior to transfer or implantation.  If a marriage is 22 
dissolved before transfer or implantation of gametes or embryos, the former spouse is not 23 
a parent of the resulting child unless the former spouse  consented in a signed record with 24 
notice to the other spouse and the woman giving birth that, if assisted reproduction were 25 
to occur after a divorce, the former spouse would be a parent of the child.  26 
2.  Withdrawal of consent prior to transfer or implanta tion.  The consent of a 27 
person to assisted reproduction under section 1924 may be withdrawn by that person in a 28 
signed record with notice to the person giving birth and any other intended parent before 29 
transfer or implantation of gametes or embryos.  A per son who withdraws consent under 30 
this subsection is not a parent of the resulting child.  31 
§1927.  Parent status of deceased person  32 
If a person who consented in a signed record under section 1924 to be a parent by 33 
assisted reproduction dies before transfer or  implantation of gametes or embryos, the 34 
deceased person is not a parent of the resulting child unless the deceased person 35 
consented in a signed record that, if assisted reproduction were to occur after death, the 36 
deceased person would be a parent of the c hild. 37

 §1928.  Birth orders  1 
1.  Proceeding for birth order.  Before or after the birth of the resulting child, a 2 
party consenting to assisted reproduction, a person who has a written agreement to be a 3 
parent pursuant to section 1922, subsection 2, paragraph  B, the intended parent or parents 4 
or the person giving birth may commence a proceeding in District Court to obtain an 5 
order:  6 
A.  Declaring that the intended parent or parents are the parent or parents of the 7 
resulting child and ordering that parental righ ts and responsibilities vest exclusively 8 
in the intended parent or parents immediately upon the birth of the child;  9 
B.  Sealing the record from the public to protect the privacy of the child and the 10 
parties; or  11 
C.  For any relief that the court determines necessary and proper.  12 
2.  State not a necessary party.  Neither this State nor the State Registrar of Vital 13 
Statistics is a necessary party to a proceeding under subsection 1.  14 
§1929.  Laboratory error  15 
If due to a laboratory error the resulting child is not  genetically related to either of the 16 
intended parents, the intended parents are the parents of the child unless otherwise 17 
determined by the court.  18

SUMMARY  4 
This bill offers an updated, comprehensive statutory framework for determining a 5 
child's legal parentage.  It is patterned after, and follows in part, the Uniform Parentage 6 
Act, a uniform law initially developed in 1973 and most recently updated in 2002 by the 7 
Uniform Law Commission.  Even though the bill adopts portions of the Uniform 8 
Parentage Act, it is sufficiently different from the Uniform Pa rentage Act overall that the 9 
chapter of statute the bill enacts merits its own, distinct title, "the Maine Parentage Act."  10 
The Maine Parentage Act is organized into 8 subchapters.  Subchapter 1 provides 11 
definitions of key terms.  It authorizes actions to a djudicate legal parentage and 12 
establishes the parameters for such actions.  Subchapter 2 is the hub of the bill.  It 13 
organizes and lists in one place the grounds upon which legal parentage may be based.  14 
They are: birth, adoption, voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, unrebutted 15 
presumption of parentage, de facto parentage, genetic parentage, consent to assisted 16 
reproduction and consent through a valid gestational carrier agreement.  The six 17 
subchapters that follow address individual grounds for parentage.  18 
The bill confirms a number of grounds for parentage under current law and in several 19 
instances proposes amendments to clarify and update the law with respect to these 20 
grounds.  For example, it updates the standards applicable to genetic testing to reflect  21 
current science and practice; provides more detailed procedures for use of the voluntary 22 
acknowledgment of paternity process in suitable cases; and codifies a traditional 23 
presumption of parentage in the legal spouse of the mother, which is only found now in a 24 
rule of evidence.  The bill also codifies the de facto parent doctrine, now firmly 25 
established by case law, to require an explicit determination of standing as a prerequisite 26 
for maintaining an action, recognize the elevated burden of proof that a per son claiming 27 
such status must satisfy and clarify the elements of proof so as to address some practical 28 
problems encountered by practitioners and courts under the case law.  29 
The bill recognizes and clarifies the legal parentage of children born to parents w ho 30 
use medical assisted reproduction as well as children born by means of assisted 31 
reproduction in conjunction with a gestational carrier.  Clear statutory guidelines and 32 
requirements serve to regulate usage, protect the rights of parties and reduce relian ce on 33 
judicial actions in this area.  34 
Finally, consistent with the Uniform Parentage Act and legislation in a number of 35 
other states, the bill recognizes the presumption of parentage in an unmarried partner of 36 
the mother who lives with the mother at the tim e of birth and holds out the child as that 37 
person's own for 2 years from birth.  38
