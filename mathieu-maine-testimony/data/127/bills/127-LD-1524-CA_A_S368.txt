1 facilities and other facilities authorized by the Board of Trustees of the Maine Veterans' 
2 Homes, using available funds. Any funds loaned to the Maine Veterans' Homes for 
3 operating purposes from the funded depreciation accounts of the Maine Veterans' Homes 
4 must be reimbursed from any funds received by the Maine Veterans' Homes and available

6 support and care for honorably discharged veterans who served on active duty in the 
7 United States Armed Forces or who served in the Reserves of the United States Armed 
8 Forces on active duty for other than training purposes.' 
9 SUMMARY 
10 This amendment, which is the minority report, maintains existing law that prescribes 
11 the number of beds at various Maine Veterans' Homes locations but strikes the provisions 
12 that establish the number of beds that certain facilities may not exceed. The amendment 
13 maintains the requirement that some facilities have a specific number of beds dedicated to 
14 dementia patients. The bill proposes to remove any specific requirements for the number 
15 of beds at any facility and for the location of the facilities, which have already been 
16 constructed.
