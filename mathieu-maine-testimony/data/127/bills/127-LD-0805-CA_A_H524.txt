Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Waiving the State's "sovereign immunity" defense and allowing the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) to be sued for damages over past actions taken could generate General Fund costs in the current biennium if 
DHHS loses or settles the suit. No estimate of the cost can be made at this time, however, the bill creates a total 
damages cap of $400,000.
