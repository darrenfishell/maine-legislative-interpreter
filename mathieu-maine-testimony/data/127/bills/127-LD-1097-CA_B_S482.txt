This amendment, which is the minority report of the committee, removes from the 
bill the restriction on the withdrawal of cash from the electronic benefits transfer system 
account of a recipient of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program benefits. It 
also requires the Office of the Attorney General to hire an additional assistant attorney 
general to prosecute fraud, replacing the provision in the bill that provides for the hiring 
of fraud investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services.

The bill includes a General Fund appropriation of $190, 790 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of Health and 
Human Services for technology updates and annual operating costs required to limit use of EBT cards outside of the 
State. Federal Expenditures Fund allocations of $108,215 and Federal Block Grant Fund allocations of$7,680 in 
fiscal year 2016-17 will also be required for this technology update. There is also an Other Special Revenue Funds 
allocation of $32, 707 in fiscal year 2016-17 to DHHS for increased legal services for additional fraud prosecutor 
services. 
Any savings achieved would likely not accrue to the General Fund due to the Maintenance of Effort spending required 
of the State to receive the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Federal Block Grant funds. 
It also includes an Other Special Revenue Funds allocation of $63,369 in fiscal year 2016-17 for the Department of 
the Attorney General for one Assistant Attorney General position and related costs.
