Except as provided in this section. timber harvesting on public reserved lands and 
nonreserved public lands may not exceed in total an average of 141,500 cords per year

harvesting level consistent with that independent inventory .. Rules adopted pursuant to 
this section are major substantive rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A 
and must be reviewed by the joint standing committee of the Legislature having

reserved lands and nonreserved public lands to an average of 141,500 cords per year over 
any 2-year period, which is the sustainable harvesting level determined by an independent 
timber inventory conducted in 2012. This amendment allows the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and forestry by rule, based on an independent timber 
inventory conducted after July 1, 2015, to establish a different sustainable harvest level. 
The rules are major substantive rules and must be reviewed by the joint standing 
committee of the Legislature having jurisdictjon over public reserved and nonreserved 
lands matters.
