This bill includes Other Special Revenue Funds allocations totaling $76,635 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department 
of Professional and Financial Regulation for the cost associated with requiring individuals practicing midwifery in the 
State to be licensed by January 1, 2020. Of that amount, $72,914 is allocated to the Licensing and Enforcement 
program for the per diem and All Other costs associated with adding 2 members to the Board of Complementary 
Health Care Providers and for contracted staffing services to assist the board in establishing the new licensing 
requirement for individuals practicing midwifery in the State. Additionally, $3,451 is allocated to the Administrative 
Services Division for the service center and STA-CAP charges. 
Because revenue from licensing fees will not be available to support the additional costs to the board until after 
January 1, 2020, General Fund support will be required in the interim years. This bill includes language that requires 
the State Controller to transfer $76,635 in fiscal year 2016-17 and $26,985 per year in fiscal year 2017-18 through 
fiscal year 2019-20 from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to the Licensing and Enforcement program, 
Other Special Revenue Funds account no later than August 1 of each year to fund the cost of this legislation.
