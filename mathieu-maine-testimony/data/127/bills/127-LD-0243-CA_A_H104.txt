1. Hearing requirements. If at any time the superintendent has reason to believe

an individual health plan as defined in section 2736-C, the superintendent shall cause a 
hearing to be held at the request of the Attorney General. In any hearing conducted under

policyholder exceeds the index of medical inflation by 2% or more, the superintendent 
shall hold meetings in at least 3 locations throughout the State to allow public comment
