This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on JUdiciary. 
It makes clear that, although generally an employer cannot request or coerce an employee 
or applicant to disclose any personal social media account infOlmation, there is an 
exception: an employer may require an employee to disclose personal social media 
account information reasonably believed to be relevant to an investigation of allegations 
of employee misconduct or a workplace violation of applicable laws, mles or regulations 
and when requiring the disclosure is not othelwise prohibited by law, as long as the 
information disclosed is accessed and used solely to the extent necessary for the purposes 
of that investigation or a related proceeding. 
This amendment makes clear that an employer retains the right to promulgate and 
maintain lawful workplace policies governing the use of the employer's electronic 
equipment, including a requirement for an employee to disclose to the employer the 
employee's user name, password or other information necessary to access employer­
issued electronic devices, including but not limited to cellular telephones and computers, 
or to access employer-provided software or e-mail accounts. 
This amendment deletes the private right of action in the bill and instead imposes 
graduated fines to be imposed by the Department ofLabor. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.
