FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
HOUSE AMENDMENT" 4" to H.P. 394, L.D. 570, Bill, "An Act To Authorize 
the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries ,al1d Wildlife To Postpone or Cancel an Open 
Hunting Season" 
Amend the bill in section 1 by striking out all of subsection 17 and inserting the 
following: 
'17. Postpone or cancel the start of an open hunting season. Notwithstanding any 
provision of subpart 4, the commissioner, based on sound scientific wildlife management 
principles, may postpone or cancel an open hunting season on any game species if the 
commissioner has concerns regarding disease, weather conditions, reduction in 
population or other unforeseen factors that may prevent publicly derived management 
goals from being met.' 
SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies the reasons for which the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries 
and Wildlife may postpone or cancel an open hunting season. Unlike the bill, which 
authorized the commissioner to postpone the season if "necessary for wildlife 
conservation purposes," this amendment sp~cifies that the commissioner may postpone 
the season if the commissioner has concerns regarding disease, weather conditions, 
reduction in population or other unforeseen factors that may prevent publicly derived 
management goals fro~ __ _
