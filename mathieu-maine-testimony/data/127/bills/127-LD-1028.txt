 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  32 MRSA ยง1357, as amended by PL 2013, c. 296, ยง6, is further amended 2 
to read:  3 
ยง1357.  Expiration and renewals  4 
Licenses expire on the last day of December of odd -numbered years following  their 5 
issuance or renewal and become invalid on that date unless renewed.  The board shall 6 
notify every person licensed under this chapter of the date of the expiration of that 7 
person's license and the amount of the fee that is required for its renewal fo r a 2 -year 8 
period, except when the applicant has become licensed during the first year of the 2 -year 9 
period, then the renewal fee is for the remaining one year of that 2 -year period.  The 10 
notice must be provided at least one month in advance of the date of  the expiration of the 11 
license.  Renewal may be effected at any time after completion of continuing education 12 
requirements and after receipt of notice by the payment of a fee established by rule by the 13 
board, which may not exceed $50 annually.  Licenses ma y be renewed up to 90 days  5 14 
years  after the date of expiration upon payment of a late fee of $10 for each quarter 15 
elapsed since the date of expiration  in addition to the applicable  renewal fee fees.  Any 16 
person who submits an application for renewal more than 90 days after the license 17 
renewal date and has held a license for less than 10 years  is subject to all requirements 18 
governing new applicants under this chapter, except that the board may in its discretion, 19 
giving due consideration to the protection of  the public, waive examination if the renewal 20 
application is made within 3 4 years from the date of the expiration.  21 
Sec. 2.  Retroactivity.  This Act applies retroactively to January 1, 2011.  22 
SUMMARY  23 
This bill, retroactive to January 1, 2011, preserves the  rights of holders of 24 
professional engineer licenses by allowing an engineer whose license has expired to 25 
renew that license up to 5 years after the date of expiration and, as long as the engineer 26 
had previously held a license as a professional engineer fo r at least 10 years, to forgo the 27 
licensure requirements otherwise applicable for a former licensee who is seeking license 28 
renewal after 90 days have elapsed, which are the same requirements applicable to new 29 
applicants.  30
