SUMMARY  13 
The purpose of this bill is to eliminate any confusion that may exist under the 14 
Personal Sports Mobile Business Practice s Act regarding whether the definition of 15 
"personal sports mobile," which includes all -terrain vehicles, also includes so -called side - 16 
by-sides for purposes of allowing side -by-sides to be sold by personal sports mobile 17 
dealers.  This bill amends the defini tion of "personal sports mobile" to specifically 18 
include a side -by-side, which is a recreational off -road vehicle that features side -by-side 19 
seating for at least 2 persons, a steering wheel and a roll bar.  20
