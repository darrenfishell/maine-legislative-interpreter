This amendment eliminates the $6,700,000 transfer from the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund to the Cost Recovery 
Fund within the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in both fiscal year 2016-17 and 2017-18 and instead directs 
$13,400,000 to be transferred from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund at the close of fiscal year 2015-16 
following certain statutorily required transfers (the so-called "cascade"). There is no guarantee that there will be 
sufficient funds from the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund to make this transfer. The amendment allows up 
to 50% of funds within the Cost Recovery Fund to go to facilities serving the Northern Maine Independent System 
Administrator region. This amendment also allows the PUC to not enter into any contract if a determination from the 
PUC is made that none of the bids are competitive. The amendment requires any funds remaining in the Cost 
Recovery Fund at the close of fiscal year 2016-17 be transferred to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund. 
The amendment makes clarifying changes to the language governing the transfer of funds from the unappropriated 
surplus of the General Fund to the Cost Recovery Fund. The new language makes clear that the transfer to the Cost 
Recovery Fund is to take place before any transfers to the Maine Budget Stabilization Fund and the Tax Relief Fund 
for Maine Residents. The amendment also adds an emergency preamble and clause, as well as eliminates the 
requirement that the PUC conduct a solicitation to procure certain energy.
