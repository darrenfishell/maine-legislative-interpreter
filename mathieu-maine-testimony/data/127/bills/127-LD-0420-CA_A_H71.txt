Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill raises the fee for petitioning the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for approval of transmission lines 
capable Of operating at 69 kilovolts or more from 4/1 00 of 1 % of the estimated cost of the transmission line to 4/1 00 
of 1 % ofthe estimated cost of the transmission line or $100,000, whichever is higher. This bill also requires those 
petitioning the PUC for approval of a transmission project operating at less than 69 kilovolts and projected to cost 
more than $20,000,000 to pay a fee of2/100 of 1 % of the estimated cost of the transmission project. The PUC has 
indicated that they expect an average of 3 petitions for transmission lines per year, resulting in an increase of Other 
Special Revenue Funds revenue to the PUC of $300,000 in fiscal year 2015-16 and in every subsequent fiscal year. 
Under current law, the PUC may exempt an applicant from paying a filing fee if it does not place an unusual burden 
on the PUC's budget. This fiscal note assumes that the PUC will not exempt these fees.
