 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, the Maine Parentage Act and changes to rules governing the child support 3 
table take effect  July 1, 2016; and  4 
Whereas, it is necessary for corrections to the child support guidelines to take effect 5 
on the same date that the Maine Parentage Act and changes to rules governing the child 6 
support table take effect; and  7 
Whereas, in the judgment of the  Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 8 
the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 9 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 10 
therefore,  11 
Be it enacted by the P eople of the State of Maine as follows:  12 
Sec. 1.  19-A MRSA §1653, sub -§13, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 13 
and affected by Pt. E, §2, is repealed.  14 
Sec. 2.  19-A MRSA §2001, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and 15 
affected by Pt. E, §2 , is amended to read:  16 
1.  Basic support entitlement.   "Basic support entitlement" means the sum derived 17 
from the child support table appropriate to the age of  for each child and the parties' gross 18 
income.  19 
Sec. 3.  19-A MRSA §2001, sub -§11, as enacted by PL  1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 20 
and affected by Pt. E, §2, is repealed.  21 
Sec. 4.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§1, as enacted by PL 1995, c. 694, Pt. B, §2 and 22 
affected by Pt. E, §2, is amended to read:  23 
1.  Determination of basic support entitlement.   After the court or h earing officer 24 
determines the annual gross income of both the parties, the 2 incomes must be added 25 
together to provide a combined annual gross income and applied to the child support table 26 
to determine the basic support entitlement for each child.  If ther e are more than 2 legal 27 
parents, the incomes of all legal parents must be added together to provide a combined 28 
annual gross income for purposes of determining the basic support entitlement for each 29 
child.  30 
When there is a child within each age category, the  The court or hearing officer shall 31 
refer to the table and locate the figure in the left -hand column that is closest to the 32 
parents' combined annual gross income.  In each age category the  The court or hearing 33 
officer shall determine the dollar figure for the total number of children for whom support 34 
is being determined , and multiply the dollar figure in each age category  by the number of 35 
children in that category and add the 2 products .  The resulting dollar amount represents 36 
the basic support entitlement.  37

 Sec. 5.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§4, as amended by PL 2005, c. 352, §3, is 1 
further amended to read:  2 
4.  Computation of parental support obligation.   The total basic support obligation 3 
must be divided between the all parties in proportion to their respective gross incomes.  4 
The court or hearing officer shall order the each party not providing primary residential 5 
care to pay, in money, that party's share of the total basic support obligation to the party 6 
providing primary residential care.  The primary resident ial care provider is presumed to 7 
spend the primary care provider's share directly on each child.  If the court or hearing 8 
officer determines that the parties provide substantially equal care for a child for whom 9 
support is sought, presumptive support must be calculated in accordance with subsection 10 
5, paragraph D -1.  Both  All parents are equally  responsible for child support if a caretaker 11 
relative provides primary residential care for the child.  The caretaker relative's income 12 
may not be considered in det ermining the parents' child support obligation.  13 
Sec. 6.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§5, ¶A, as amended by PL 2015, c. 186, §3, is 14 
further amended to read:  15 
A.  When the a parent who is not the primary care provider is legally obligated to 16 
support a child in that party's household other than the child for whom a support order 17 
is being sought, an adjustment must be made to that party's parental support 18 
obligation.  The adjustment is made by using the nonprimary residential care 19 
provider's annual gross income to comp ute a theoretical support obligation under the 20 
support guidelines for each child in that household.  Neither the child support 21 
received by nor the financial contributions of the other parent  parents  of each child in 22 
the household are considered in the theo retical support calculation.  The obligation is 23 
then subtracted from the annual gross income, and the adjusted income is the amount 24 
used to calculate support.  The adjustment is used in all appropriate cases.  25 
Sec. 7.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§5, ¶C, as amende d by PL 2011, c. 34, §2, is 26 
further amended to read:  27 
C.  The subsistence needs of the nonprimary care provider  providers  must be taken 28 
into account when establishing the parental support obligation.  If the annual gross 29 
income of the a nonprimary care prov ider is less than the federal poverty guideline, 30 
the that nonprimary care provider's weekly parental support obligation may not 31 
exceed 10% of the that nonprimary care provider's weekly gross income, regardless 32 
of the amount of the parties' combined annual gross income.  The child support table 33 
includes a self -support reserve for obligors earning   $22,800 or less  per year.  If , 34 
within an age category, the  a nonprimary care provider's annual gross income, 35 
without adjustments for children in the household , is in the self -support reserve for 36 
the total number of children for whom support is being determined, the amount listed 37 
in the self -support reserve multiplied by the number of children in the age category  is 38 
the that nonprimary care provider's support obligat ion for the children in that age 39 
category , regardless of the parties' combined annual gross income.  The nonprimary 40 
care provider's  providers'  proportional share of childcare  child care , health insurance 41 
premiums and extraordinary medical expenses are adde d to this basic support 42 
obligation.  This paragraph does not apply if its application would result in a greater 43 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR2466(01) -1 
 support obligation than a support obligation determined without application of this 1 
paragraph.  2 
Sec. 8.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§5, ¶D, as amended by PL 2003, c. 415, §9, is 3 
further amended to read:  4 
D.  When any of  the parties have equal annual gross incomes and provide 5 
substantially equal care for each child for whom support is being determined, neither 6 
party is  none of those parties are  required to  pay the other  any other of those parties  a 7 
parental support obligation.  The Those  parties shall share equally the child care 8 
costs, health insurance premiums and uninsured medical expenses.  9 
Sec. 9.  19-A MRSA §2006, sub -§5, ¶D -1, as enacted by PL 2003, c . 415, §10, is 10 
amended to read:  11 
D-1.    When the parties do not have equal annual gross incomes but provide 12 
substantially equal care for each child for whom support is being determined, the 13 
presumptive parental support obligation must be determined as foll ows. 14 
 (1)  The enhanced support entitlement for each child must be determined.  15 
 (2)  Using the enhanced support entitlement, a parental support obligation for 16 
each child must be determined by dividing the total enhanced support obligation 17 
between  among  the parties in proportion to their respective gross incomes.  18 
 (3)  The A party with the a higher annual gross income than another party  has a 19 
presumptive obligation to pay the other party the lower of:  20 
 (a)  The difference between their parental support oblig ations as calculated 21 
in subparagraph (2); and  22 
 (b)  The presumptive parental support obligation determined for the payor 23 
party using the basic support entitlement under the support guidelines as 24 
though the other party provided primary residential care of t he child.  25 
 (4)  The parties shall share the child care costs, health insurance premiums and 26 
uninsured medical expenses in proportion to their incomes.  27
