SUMMARY  34 
Under current law, all municipalities of more than 4,000 residents must enforce the 35 
Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.  Municipalities with 4,000 or fewer residents 36 
are not required to adopt or enfo rce the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code, but if 37 
such a municipality adopts or enforces a building code, it must be the Maine Uniform 38

 Building Code, the Maine Uniform Energy Code or the Maine Uniform Building and 1 
Energy Code.  2 
This bill allows, but do es not require, a municipality of more than 4,000 residents to 3 
adopt and enforce a building code, but it restricts the code that may be adopted or 4 
enforced by that municipality to the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code.  5
