This amendment limits the payment of the increased employmmt tax increment to one year rather than 5 years as 
specified in the committee amendment. This provision would diminate the General Fund and Local Government 
Fund revenue losses in fiscal year 2017-18 and after but keeps the revenue loss in 2016-17. It also eliminates the 
reporting requirement of the Loring Development Authority.
