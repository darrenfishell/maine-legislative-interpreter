SUMMARY  17 
This bill makes changes to various reporting requirements in the environmental 18 
protection laws.  It eliminates a biennial report to the Legislature by the directors of the 19 
Clean Government Initiative and regular reports by the Commissioner of Environmental 20 
Protection on the status of licensed discharges and oil spill prevention and control.  21 
Instead of requiring the commissioner to report annually to the Legislature o n the surface 22 
water ambient toxic monitoring program, this bill requires a limited biennial executive 23 
summary.  It changes a cross -reference to correct the citation.  It changes rule -making 24 
authority regarding hazardous waste, waste oil  and biomedical was te by moving 25 
authority from the Board of Environmental Protection to the Commissioner of 26 
Environmental Protection.  27
