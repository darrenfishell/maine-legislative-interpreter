This amendment is the majority report of the committee. This amendment removes 
from the bill the provision that specifies a minimum sentence of imprisonment of 4 years 
for a Class A violation or 2 years for a Class B violation of the law prohibiting illegal 
importation of scheduled drugs. The amendment adds aggravated illegal importation of a 
scheduled drug to the crimes that may result, under certain circumstances, in the 
forfeiture of firearms. The amendment retains the provisions of the bill that establish a 
new crime of aggravated illegal importation of a scheduled drug and specify for that 
crime a minimum sentence of imprisonment of 4 years for a Class A violation and 2 years 
for a Class B violation.
