10 This amendment is the majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary. 
11 This amendment replaces the bill but retains the overall concept of establishing one 
12 court in which proceedings involving custody and other parental rights with respect to a 
13 child will take place. The bill proposes that the District Court would have exclusive, 
14 continuing jurisdiction in all such proceedings if there is a pending action in the District 
15 Court or if a final judgment involving the child had been entered in the District Court. 
16 This amendment extends the jurisdiction of the District Court to include exclusive 
17 jurisdiction over matters involving custody or other parental rights of a child under the 
18 Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-A, including, but not limited to, adoption, termination of 
19 parental rights, change of name and guardianship of a minor, if proceedings concerning 
20 the child are pending in the District Court. 
21 This amendment provides that, in any matter involving custody or other parental 
22 rights of a child, the judge of the District Court or the probate judge who is presiding 
23 must require all parties to disclose whether the parties have knowledge of any existing 
24 order or if any proceeding involving custody or other parental rights is currently filed or 
25 pending or if any other related action is pending before any court of this State or another 
26 state. If the proceeding is in a probate court in this State, the judge of probate must 
27 transfer the case to the District Court.

This bill includes a General Fund appropriation 
of $412, 7 50 in fiscal year 2016-17 for the Judicial Department for one 
Judge position, one Deputy Marshall position and one Assistant Clerk position due to an anticipated increase in the 
number of district court cases involving children. 
The Office of Child and Family Services within the Department of Human Services has indicated to the Judiciary 
Committee that having all actively pending matters concerning a child and family unit addressed by a single District 
Court Judge will provide efficiencies and reduce workload within the OFCS. Accordingly, the OFCS has offered, and 
the bill includes, an offsetting General Fund deappropriation to the Department of Human Services of $412,750 in 
fiscal year 2016-17.
