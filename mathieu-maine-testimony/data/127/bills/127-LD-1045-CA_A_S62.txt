SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the laws regarding the collection and recycling of mercury­
added thermostats as follows: 
1. It retains the provision from the bill that adds a defmition for the term "contractor"; 
2. It clarifies that the financial incentive provided for the return of a mercury-added 
thermostat is to be provided to any person who returns a mercury-added thermostat to an 
established recycling collection point; and 
3. It retains the provision from the bill that changes the due date on the annual 
manufacturer's report to the Department of Environmental Protection from January 30th 
to April 1 st and removes the requirement that the report contain an accounting of 
administrative costs. 
The amendment also retains the provision from the bill that directs the department to 
review the financial incentive plan under the laws regarding the collection and recycling 
of mercury-added thermostats and, by February 15, 2016, submit a report to the Joint 
Standing Committee on Environment and Natural Resources addressing certain aspects of 
the plan and, where applicable, recommending legislation to amend the plan or other 
relevant laws. 
The amendment removes from the bill the provisions that require contractors to 
submit annual reports to the department containing information on the contractor and the 
thermostats removed from service and disposed of during the previous calendar year and 
that repeal at a future date certain portions of the laws regarding the collection and 
recycling of mercury-added thermostats.
