The amendment retains the provision of the bill that repeals the section of Public Law 
2013, chapter 436 that provides that Maine's genetically modified food products labeling 
law does not take effect until 4 other contiguous states enact similar laws. 
The amendment repeals the provision that food may not be labeled as natural if it has 
been genetically engineered. 
The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section to the bill.

Current law requires that 
if at least five contiguous states, including Maine, adopt legislation requiring mandatory 
labeling of genetically engineered food by January 1, 2018, then food offered for retail sale that is genetically 
engineered requires disclosure. This bill requires labeling in Maine by removing the requirement that five contiguous 
states adopt labeling. The bill also adds required disclosures for genetically engineered seed stock offered for retail 
sale. The bill includes General Fund appropriations of $182,022 and Other Special Revenue Funds allocations of $7 48 
in fiscal year 2016-17 to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry for two Consumer Protection 
Inspector positions, one Office Associate II position and other related costs. 
The Department of the Attorney General may require additional General Fund appropriations for litigation costs 
resulting from this bill. No estimate of this cost is made at this time.
