This bill makes the following changes to the laws governing the Temporary 26

1.  It removes all the good cause exceptions that preve nt a person from being 28 
sanctioned under the Additional Support for People in Retraining and Employment - 29 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or ASPIRE -TANF, program or the TANF 30 
program for failure to participate in the ASPIRE -TANF program, with the ex ception of 31 
domestic violence.  32 
2.  It removes the 24 -month limit on education training and treatment for participants 33

federal law regarding the number of months of education a nd training that may qualify as 35 
countable work activities and specifies that accommodations for an individual with a 36 
disability are limited to those required by federal law.  37
