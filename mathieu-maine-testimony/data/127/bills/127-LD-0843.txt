Administra tion for the previous calendar year from the national average wage index of 14 
the next previous calendar year, the minimum hourly wage in effect at that time must be 15 
increased by the same percentage.   If the highest federal minimum wage is increased in 16 
exces s of the minimum wage in effect under this section, the minimum wage under this 17 
section is increased to the same amount, effective on the same date as the increase in the 18 
federal minimum wage , but in no case may the minimum wage exceed the minimum 19 
wage oth erwise in effect under this section by more than $1 per hour . 20 
Sec. 2.  26 MRSA §664, sub -§2, as amended by PL 2011, c. 118, §3, is further 21 
amended to read:  22 
2.  Tip credit.   An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service 23 
employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage 24 
established in this section.  Starting October 1, 2015, the tip credit may not exceed $3.00 25 
per hour.  Starting October 1, 2016, the tip credit may not exceed $2.25 per hour.  26 
Starting October 1, 2 017, the tip credit may not exceed $1.50 per hour.  Starting October 27 
1, 2018, the tip credit may not exceed $0.75 per hour.  Starting October 1, 2019, an 28 
employer may not use a tip credit.   An employer who elects to use the tip credit must 29 
inform the affec ted employee in advance and must be able to show that the employee 30 
receives at least the minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are 31 
combined.  Upon a satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's 32 
representative that the actual ti ps received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall 33 
increase the direct wages by the difference.  34 
The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may 35 
not be shared with the employer.   Tips that are automatically in cluded in the customer's 36 
bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service 37 
employee.  A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the 38 
employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting 39 
reimbursement from a credit card company.  40
