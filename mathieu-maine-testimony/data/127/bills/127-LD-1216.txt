SUMMARY  31 
This bill addresses several ambiguities with regard to the powers of guardians of 32 
persons with intellectual disabilities or autism.  33 
Currently, the Probate Code provides no clear restrictions on how far the court may 34 
expa nd the guardian's powers.  This bill resolves the ambiguity by clearly allowing 35 
probate courts to continue to use the broad powers granted by the guardianship statute.  It 36 
also provides a 2nd avenue through which a right may be waived or restricted.  This is 37 
consistent with the historical role of the probate court in administering guardianships.  38 
 
 Page 7 - 127LR1100(01) -1 
 This bill also clarifies the rights of persons with intellectual disabilities or autism, as 1 
well as provides that, although the Department of Health and Human Servi ces has 2 
authority to oversee certain types of behavioral interventions and related actions, that 3 
authority may not be used to limit the authority of guardians.  4
