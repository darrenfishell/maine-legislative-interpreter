SUMMARY  12 
This bill reforms the Maine income tax by establishing a rate structure that includes 6 13 
income tax bracket thresholds with top marginal tax rates from 0% to 10%. The i ncome 14 
tax bracket thresholds for each rate are calculated by the State Tax Assessor every 5 15 
calendar years to maintain the same level of progressivity of the tax by maintaining the 16 
same percentage of taxpayers in each top marginal rate category.  17 
This bill also repeals the Tax Relief Fund for Maine Residents and increases the 18 
percentage of excess General Fund revenues transferred to the Maine Budget 19 
Stabilization Fund by the amount currently transferred to the tax relief fund.  20
