SUMMARY 
This amendment is the majority report of the committee. This amendment repeals 2 
conflicting versions of the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1107-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph B, which was amended by Public Law 2015, chapter 308, section 
2 and chapter 346, section 6. The amendment resolves the conflicts and enacts a new 
version of Title 17-A, section 1107-A, subsection 1, paragraph B. Under this 
amendment, and subject to other provisions of law that address the quantities of drugs 
possessed: 
1. The first offense of possession of oxycodone, hydrocodone or hydromorphone is a 
Class D crime, and a 2nd or subsequent offense is a Class C crime; 
2. Possession of heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl powder is a Class C crime; 
3. Possession of cocaine in a quantity of 14 grams or more is a Class C crime and 
possession of less than 14 grams is a Class D crime; and 
4. Possession of cocaine in the form of cocaine base if the quantity is 4 grams or 
more or if the offense is a 2nd or subsequent offense is a Class C crime. 
This amendment also amends the law on affirmative defenses to charges of 
possession of schedule W prescription drugs to take into account reordering in Title 17-A, 
section 1107-A, subsection 1, paragraph B the list of prescription drugs as a result of 
resolving the conflict and amends the law on deferred disposition under Title 17-A, 
section 1348-A to affirmatively state that deferred disposition is a preferred disposition in 
a prosecution for possession of schedule W drugs under Title 17-A, section 1107-A, 
subsection 1, paragraph B.
