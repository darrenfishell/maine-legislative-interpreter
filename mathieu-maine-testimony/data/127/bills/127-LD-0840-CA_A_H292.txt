Current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
This legislation requires the Department of Education to annually collect and report data regarding the progress of 
public schools and public chmier schools towm'ds implementing proficiency-based diplomas. The Department of 
Education has indicated that the funding to support the data collection costs associated with this requirement is 
included in LD 1019, the Governor's proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget. Therefore, no General Fund 
appropriations are needed. If, however, the funding for the department's data collection efforts is not included as part 
of the final actions of the Legislature on the 2016-2017 biennial budget, this fiscal note may need to be adjusted.
