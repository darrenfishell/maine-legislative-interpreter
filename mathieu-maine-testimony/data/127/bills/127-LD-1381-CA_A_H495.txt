must be computed on the date in divisions (a) to (c) that yields the highest fair 
market value: 
(a) The date the manufacturer announces the action that results in 
termination, cancellation, noncontinuance or nonrenewal;

value to the licensed new motor vehicle dealer if the new distributor or the 
manufacturer offers the dealer a franchise agreement with terms acceptable to the 
dealer.

manufacturer for the line make and intends to distribute motor vehicles of that line 
make in this State, that entity shall honor the franchise agreements of the original 
manufacturer and its licensed new motor vehicle dealers or offer those dealers of that

inserting after the following: "approved" the following: " except as otherwise indicated' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment amends the bill to designate the contents of the bill as Part A. 
This amendment deletes from the bill sections 1 and 2 because the errors they correct 
have been resolved by Public Law 2015, chapter 148. 
The amendment revises a provision in the bill to correct the list of categories of meat 
and poultry processors that may register with the Department of Agriculture, 
Conservation and Forestry to engage in intrastate commerce to make it clear that the 
categories are alternatives. 
This amendment revises the labeling requirements included in the bill to carry out the 
intent of Public Law 2013, chapter 304 to allow mobile poultry processing unit operators 
to sell uninspected poultry products at a farmers' market, to a locally owned grocery store 
or to a locally owned restaurant only if specific labeling requirements are met. 
This amendment adds Part B to include corrections that may be considered 
substantive changes. Part B: 
1. Corrects a conflict created when Public Law 2011, chapter 298 amended the 
Maine Revised Statutes, Title 17-A, section 1057, subsection 3 and Public Law 2011, 
chapter 394 repealed Title 17-A, section 1057, subsection 3. This amendment corrects the 
conflict by repealing the subsection and replacing it with the chapter 298 version. This 
correction is supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public 
Safety; 
2. Corrects a conflict created by Public Law 1981, chapters 150 and 175, which 
enacted the same provision of law with a minor difference. Chapter 150 used the phrase 
"evidence of individual insurability" where chapter 175 used the phrase "evidence of 
insurability." This amendment corrects the conflict by repealing the provision and 
replacing it with the chapter 150 version;

3. Corrects an error by adding a cross-reference that was inadvertently omitted. This 
correction is supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Insurance and Financial 
Services; and 
4. Corrects a conflict created when Public Law 2013, chapter 451 amended Public 
Law 2013, chapter 368, Part S, section 9 and Public Law 2013, chapter 595 repealed the 
same provision by repealing Public Law 2013, chapter 368, Part S, section 9. 
This amendment adds Part C to amend Title to, section 1174, subsection 3 to correct 
the erroneous inclusion of Title to, section 1174, subsection 3, paragraph W in the 
committee amendment to L.D. 1482 in the 126th Legislature. It provides that the changes 
apply retroactively to the effective date of Public Law 2013, chapter 534, which enacted 
Title 10, section 1174, subsection 3, paragraph W. These changes are substantive and 
supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Labor, Commerce, Research and 
Economic Development. 
This amendment adds Part D to correct technical conflicts between 2 bills related to 
alcoholic beverage tastings conducted by retailers and the role of sales representatives in 
those events. Public Law 2015, chapters 129 and 184 amended the same sections of Title 
28-A in different ways. Chapter 129 was enacted as an emergency, but chapter 184 was 
not, therefore this amendment provides that Part D takes effect 90 days after the 
adjournment of the First Regular Session of the 127th Legislature to be consistent with 
chapter 184's effective date. 
This amendment adds Part E to correct a clerical error in the Maine Energy Cost 
Reduction Act concerning energy cost reduction contracts, enacted by Public Law 2013, 
chapter 369, by twice replacing the word "contact" with "contract." This is a technical 
correction.
