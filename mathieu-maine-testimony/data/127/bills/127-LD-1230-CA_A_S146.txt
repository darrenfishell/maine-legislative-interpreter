Potential current biennium cost increase -General Fund 
Additional costs to the Department of Education associated with working with the advisory group to develop the 
implementation plan and timeline for the establishment of the digital content library and with providing professional 
development and training on the use of the digital content library can be absorbed within the existing budgeted 
resources of the department. However, depending on the recommendations of the advisory group, the department may 
require General Fund appropriations to establish the library. If additional resources are needed, the Department of 
Education will submit a request in the next supplemental budget.
