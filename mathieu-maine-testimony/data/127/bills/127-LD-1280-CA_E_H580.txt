3 The portion of the license fee submitted in accordance with section 1018, subsection 
4 1, paragraph C-2 must be deposited into a nonlapsing, dedicated account to be 
5 administered by the board. The purpose of the account is to maintain the level of revenue 
6 distributed to host municipalities under section 1011, subsection 4; section 1036, 
7 subsection 2, paragraph J; and section 1036, subsection 2-A, paragraph F and to a host 
8 county under section 1036, subsection 2-A, paragraph J and property tax revenue 
9 received by host municipalities. If a casino initially licensed to operate prior to January 
10 1, 2016 ceases operation within 5 years of the commencement of the operation of slot 
11 machines at a casino in York County or Cumberland County, the board shall distribute 
12 revenues to the county that received distributions under section 1036, subsection 2-A, 
13 paragraph J, if applicable, and the municipality in which the closed casino was operated. 
14 The board shall determine the distribution amount by calculating the average annual 
15 distribution to the host county or host municipality of the closed casino from the last 5 
16 full calendar years in which distributions were received from casinos initially licensed 
17 prior to January 1, 2016 and by factoring in any reduction in the amount of property tax 
18 revenues received by the municipality directly related to the cessation of casino 
19 operations. The distribution amount determined by the board must be decreased by the 
20 amounts distributed from a casino operated in York County or Cumberland County under 
21 section 1036, subsection 2-D, paragraphs K, M and N. The board shall determine the 
22 distribution amounts within 90 days of the closure of a casino initially licensed prior to 
23 January 1, 2016 and begin making distributions to the municipality and county, as 
24 applicable, as soon as practicable thereafter. Nothing in this section prohibits distribution 
25 to each municipality or county in which a casino initially licensed prior to January 1, 
26 2016 is operated as long as the casino ceases operation within 5 years after the 
27 commencement of the operation of slot machines at a casino in York County or 
28 Cumberland County. Distributions made to a municipality or county in accordance with 
29 this section continue for a period of 5 years after receiving an initial distribution from the 
30 board in accordance with this section. If the amount in the account is insufficient to make 
31 distributions to the county or municipalities as required by this section, the board may 
32 require additional payment from the operator of the casino in York County or 
33 Cumberland County to make distributions required by this section. If no casino initially 
34 licensed prior to January l, 2016 ceases operation within 5 years of the commencement 
35 of slot machine operation at a casino in York County or Cumberland County or if funds 
36 remain in the account after distributions are made in accordance with this section for the 
37 5-year period, the funds must be deposited in the Department of Transportation, Highway 
38 and Bridge Capital program, Other Special Revenue Funds account within the Highway 
39 Fund as established by Title 23, section 1651 for capital improvement purposes. 
40 Sec. 17. 8 MRSA §1019, sub-§6, as amended by PL 2011, c. 417, §5, is repealed. 
41 Sec. 18. 8 MRSA §1019, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2011, c. 417, §6, is repealed.

26 SUMMARY 
27 This amendment replaces the bill and is the majority report of the committee. The 
28 amendment establishes a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino 
29 in either York County or Cumberland County. The amendment establishes the Casino 
30 Development Commission, which is an independent board of 5 members appointed by 
31 the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
32 request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Department of 
33 Public Safety, Gambling Control Board for a casino operator license. Prior to submitting 
34 a request for proposals, either York County or Cumberland County, or both, would have 
35 to hold a referendum vote asking voters to allow the operation of a casino in their county. 
36 The referendum must be held on the same date as a statewide election no sooner than 
37 June 1, 2017 and no later than July 1, 2018. The fee to submit a bid is $250,000. The 
38 amendment provides for specific supporting information to be submitted by the bidder 
39 and considered by the commission including the bidder's ability to make a minimum 
40 $250,000,000 capital investment in the resort-style casino and information regarding job 
41 creation, economic development, plans to mitigate negative infrastructure impacts and the 
42 bidder's support of the harness racing industry. Under the amendment, the commission is 
Page 14 -127LR1572(15)-1 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
~ors 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "c" to H.P. 876, L.D. 1280 
1 directed to develop a point system for the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals 
2 and give priority to proposals that create jobs, promote economic development, increase 
3 tourism and support a casino that fits the character of the State. The winning bidder must 
4 enter into a contract with the commission that obligates the casino operator to abide by 
5 the proposals made in the winning bid. Failure to abide by the terms of the contract could 
6 result in financial penalties to the casino operator. 
7 The license fee for a casino under the amendment is $55,000,000, of which 
8 $5,000,000 is deposited into the General Fund to be used for administrative expenses of 
9 the Gambling Control Board. The remaining $50,000,000 is deposited into an account to 
10 be used to mitigate the impact of lost revenue on the municipalities and a county in which 
11 casinos are currently located. The Gambling Control Board will distribute money from 
12 the account to the municipalities and county based on distributions the municipalities and 
13 county had been receiving from the casino. 
14 If a person initially licensed to operate the casino surrenders the license or the license 
15 is revoked, a subsequent licensee may operate the casino only for the remainder of the 
16 license term and is subject to a $500,000 transfer fee. A subsequent licensee is subject to 
17 the contract executed when the casino in either York County or Cumberland County was 
18 initially licensed. 
19 The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine revenue at 40% and the 
20 distribution of net table game revenue at 16% for the resort-style casino. It directs the 
21 Gambling Control Board to withhold distributions of slot and table game revenues from 
22 the existing casinos upon the commencement of operation of the casino authorized by this 
23 amendment until the required distributions are established at those rates for all casinos by 
24 the Legislature. The amendment provides for various recipients of slot machine revenue 
25 and requires table game revenue to be deposited to the Fund to Reform Veterans 
26 Services. Allocations from the fund are made through grants to support the needs of 
27 veterans as governed by the policies and objectives of the Maine Veterans Assistance 
28 Council, which is established by this amendment. 
29 The amendment requires the executive director of the State Harness Racing 
30 Commission to submit a report to the joint standing committees of the Legislature having 
31 jurisdiction over casino matters and agricultural matters. The executive director is 
32 required to consult with the commission and members of the harness racing industry to 
33 make recommendations that will increase the number of breeders in the Sire Stakes Fund 
34 program and structure distributions so that the money is not concentrated among a small 
35 percentage of breeders. 
36 The amendment also adds an appropriations and allocations section.

If York and Cumberland counties choose to hold referendums during the state primary election in June 2017, the 
Department of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of $45 ,812 for ballot printing costs and 
postage. If the counties choose to hold referendums during the general election in November 2017, the Department 
of Secretary of State would need a General Fund appropriation of$45,812 for ballot printing costs and postage only 
if the questions require printing a separate ballot. 
The bill establishes the Fund to Reform Veterans Services in the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
Services with a base Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) allocation of $500 beginning in fiscal year 2016-17 in 
order to allow the department to spend any monies received. 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for a casino to a single 
applicant. Bidders will pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The Gambling Control Board 
will accept an application for a casino license in either York County or Cumberland County from the winning bidder 
as long as the voters of the county where the proposed casino will be located have voted to approve a casino. Only 
one casino, in either York or Cumberland County, may be licensed. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 40% ofnet slot income and 16% ofnet table game income. The bill requires 
a casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make annual capital improvements to 
the casino using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine income and net table game income generated during the previous 
year or direct those funds to the Gambling Control Board. This fiscal note assumes the facility will not direct these 
funds to the Gambling Control Board. This fiscal note assumes a total of 1,000 slot machines and 24 table games, 
generating an estimated annual revenue of$27,635,877 in OSRF revenue and $1,257,931 in General Fund revenue. 
LR1572(15) -Fiscal Note -Page 1 of3 
~ IO(C)U L. L L' I -.JU-,/) 
Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license is 
$55,000,000, with $5,000,000 going to the General Fund and $50,000,000 going into an OSRF account within the 
Gambling Control Board. $126,400 in annual OSRF revenue will be generated from registration fees on slot 
machines and table games. The $50,000,000 will remain in the OSRF account for 5 years after the new casino in 
York or Cumberland County becomes operational and then be transferred to the Department of Transportation, 
Highway and Bridge Capital Program if Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino continue to operate and provide 
revenue to host municipalities and counties. If either ceases to operate, then distributions will be made from the 
OSRF account to compensate certain municipalities and counties, with the distributions lasting 5 years and any 
remaining monies being transferred to the Highway and Bridge Capital Program. Annual state costs associated with 5 
inspectors, 1 auditor, 1 detective and 1 office specialist and other related expenses are estimated to be $763,705. 
Under current law, if the Penobscot Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribe, the fund to supplement harness racing purses 
or the Sire Stakes Fund receive funds from a casino other than Oxford Casino or Hollywood Casino, then the 
recipient may not receive funds from Oxford Casino. This would cause Oxford Casino's tax rate on net slot revenue 
to be reduced to 40% from the current 46% rate, resulting in an estimated annual OSRF revenue loss of $3,032,560 
starting in the year the new southern Maine casino becomes operational and makes distributions to all three 
recipients. 
WhiteSand Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in revenue to 
Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to open. This fiscal note assumes the same 20% reduction, 
resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of$379,070 and OSRF revenue loss of$5,134,388 when 
the southern Maine casino becomes operational. An assessment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood 
Casino has not been done at this time. 
Under current law, State revenue from both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino go to various funds, but this bill 
directs all State revenue from these casinos to go to the Gambling Control Board when the new southern Maine 
casino becomes operational, until a new distribution of slot machine and table game revenue is established in law. 
This results in an estimated annual General Fund revenue decrease of$8,382,405 and an annual OSRF revenue 
increase of$8,382,405. The bill requires the new distribution to be 40% of net slot machine revenue and 16% of net 
table game revenue for both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino, resulting in an estimated annual OSRF revenue 
loss of$2,285,71 lat the time the new tax rates become law. Due to the recipients of future net slot machine and net 
table game distributions being unknown at this time, there is no current estimate on the amount of net slot machine 
and net table game revenue that would go to the General Fund and OSRF. 
The additional costs to the Office of the Attorney General are expected to be minor.
