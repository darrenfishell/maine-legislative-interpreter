 Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 1 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and  2 
Whereas, research has found that virtual public charter schools operated in other 3 
states have produ ced mixed results when using federal benchmarks to evaluate the 4 
academic performance of students enrolled in virtual public charter schools; and  5 
Whereas, implementation of Maine's recently enacted charter school law has 6 
resulted in significant controversy over the governance and quality of virtual public 7 
charter schools; and  8 
Whereas, this controversy demonstrates the need for a thorough review of state 9 
policy to ensure that the authorization and operation of virtual public charter schools 10 
proceed in a manne r that preserves public confidence that the interests of students, school 11 
administrative units and citizens across the State have been given due consideration; and  12 
Whereas, the protection of the public interests of students, school administrative 13 
units and  citizens of the State requires that the process for authorizing virtual public 14 
charter schools be temporarily interrupted pending the necessary review of the charter 15 
school laws; and  16 
Whereas, in order for the Maine Charter School Commission to review virt ual 17 
public charter schools and prepare a report in time for submission to the 127th 18 
Legislature, the review needs to be initiated as soon as possible; and  19 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 20 
the meaning of th e Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 21 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 22 
therefore,  23 
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  24
