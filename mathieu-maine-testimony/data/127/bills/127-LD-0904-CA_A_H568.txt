17 Ethics and Election Practices, et al., United States District Court, District of Maine, 
18 Docket No. 1:14-CV-266-DBH. 
19 The amendment provides that contributions received by a candidate for a primary 
20 election must be segregated from those received for the general election. The amendment

22 primary election contributions received prior to the deadline by which primary candidates 
23 must submit petitions to take part in a primary election. Contributions carried forward 
24 from the primary election to the general election are subject to the dollar limits that apply 
25 to contributions made to a candidate by a single donor. The amendment permits a 
26 candidate who defeats a primary opponent to carry forward to the general election 
27 unspent contributions received for the primary election. Regardless of whether the

30 candidate must return at least the excess amount to the donor.

35 aggregate contributions to all political candidates.
