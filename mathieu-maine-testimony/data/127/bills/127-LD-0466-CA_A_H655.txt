each customer in a municipality listed in this subsection in which the obligation to 
provide provider of last resort service will be removed. That notice must include the 
following information: 
( 1) An existing customer will still be provided service for one year from the date 
on which the obligation to provide provider of last resort service is removed at 
the same rates, terms and conditions as the price cap ILEC provides to provider

provide provider of last resort service; and 
(2) The date, time and location of the public meeting required under paragraph 
D, which will be hosted by the commission in the municipality.

municipalities listed in subsection 4, the price cap ILEC may petition the commission

there is sufficient competition in that municipality to ensure access to affordable 
telephone service by households in the municipality:

based voice network service provider that offers service to at least 95% of the

provide competitive information to the commission but may rely on other available 
sources for this information, including information available from· the Federal 
Communications Commission. Competitive information about the extent of service 
provided by wireline-facilities-based voice network service providers and mobile 
telecommunications services providers used to make this determination is 
confidential and is not a public record under Title 1, section 402, subsection 3 and 
may not be disclosed to any person outside the commission. In developing the 
methodology under this paragraph, the commission may allow . for reasonable 
adjustments to the information it receives if it is aware that actual availability of 
competitive services differs from what is reflected in the information. If the 
application of the commission's methodology results in a finding that the standards in 
paragraph A, subparagraph (1) have been met, there is a rebuttable presumption of 
sufficient competition in a municipality to ensure access to affordable telephone 
service by households in the municipality., 
C. Ninety days prior to filing a petition under this subsection, a price cap ILEC shall 
notify the commission and the Office of the Public Advocate of the price cap ILEC's 
intent to file a petition. The price cap ILEC shall also give advance notice of its 
intent to file a petition in its monthly billing statement to each customer in the 
municipality in which it will be seeking relief from the obligation to provide provider 
of last resort service. 
The commission shall hold a public hearing in each affected municipality to allow 
customers of the price cap ILEC as well as other residents of the affected 
municipality to testify. The price cap ILEC shall give advance notice of the hearing 
to each customer in the municipality in its monthly billing statement and publish this 
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in that municipality. 
D. The commission shall issue an order granting or denying a petition within 180 
days of receiving a petition under this subsection, except that the commission, at its 
discretion, may extend this period for up to an additional 30 days. 
E. For one year from the date the commission issues an order granting a price cap 
ILEC relief from the obligation to provide provider of last resort service in a 
municipality, the price cap ILEC shall continue to offer to each provider of last resort 
service customer in that municipality to whom it was providing the service on the 
date of that order a telephone service with the same rates, terms and conditions as it 
provides to provider of last resort service customers to whom it is obligated to 
provide provider of last resort service. 
For purposes of this subsection, "voice network service provider" has the same meaning 
as in section 7104. 
6. Abandonment. A price cap ILEC may not discontinue, reduce or impair the 
service that it provides in a municipality, or part of a municipality, where it has 
previously served as the provider of provider of last resort service unless the commission 
approves the discontinuance, reduction or impairment. The commission may approve the 
discontinuance, reduction or impairment only if it finds that neither the present nor future 
public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected by such discontinuance, 
reduction or impairment of service.

In granting its approval under this subsection, the commission may impose such terms, 
conditions or requirements as in its judgment are necessary to protect the public interest. 
A price cap ILEC abandoning all or part of its plant, property or system or discontinuing 
service pursuant to authority granted by the commission under this subsection is deemed 
to have waived all objections to the terms, conditions or requirements imposed by the 
commission in its approval. A discontinuance approved under this subsection is not 
subject to further approval under section 1104. 
7. Rules. Rules adopted pursuant to this section are major substantive rules as 
defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A. 
Sec. 4. 35-A MRSA §7222-A is enacted to read: 
§7222-A. Rates 
1. Price cap ILEC rate requirements. The provisions of sections 304 and 307 do 
not apply to a price cap ILEC with respect to the rates for provider of last resort service. 
A price cap ILEC shall post on its publicly accessible website the rates, terms and 
conditions for provider of last resort service. Rates for provider of last resort service 
provided by the price cap ILEC are governed by the following: 
A. On the effective date of this paragraph, the monthly charge for provider of last 
resort service offered by a price cap ILEC may not exceed $20 for any residential 
customer. A price cap ILEC may, beginning one year after the effective date of this 
paragraph, increase rates for its provider of last resort service by up to 5% annually: 
and 
B. Low-income customers of a price cap ILEC must receive a monthly discount of 
$3 .50 in addition to any applicable federal subsidy for voice service for low-income_ 
customers. 
For the purposes of this subsection, "low-income customer" means a customer who 
qualifies for assistance under the Federal Communications Commission's Lifeline 
program, as defined in 47 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 54.401. 
Sec. 5. 35-A MRSA §7225-A is enacted to read: 
§7225-A. Price cap ILEC service quality requirements 
1. Service gualitv metrics reporting. A price cap ILEC shall report to the

C. The percentage of installation appointments not met: and 
D. The average delay, in days, for missed installation appointments.

2. Minimum requirements. A price cap ILEC shall provide service that meets the 
following minimum requirements, based on rolling one-year averages, in the areas in 
which it serves as provider of provider of last resort service:

5 B. Less than 20% of network troubles not cleared within 48 hours; 
6 C. Less than 12% of all installation appointments not met; and 
7 D. Less than a 9-day average delay for missed installation appointments. 
8 3. Failure to meet service quality requirements. If a· price cap ILEC fails to meet 
9 any service quality requirement in this section for any 2 consecutive quarters, the results 
10 for these service quality requirements for these quarters are no longer confidential and 
11 become public records. The commission shall investigate a failure to meet a service 
12 quality requirement. If the commission concludes after investigation that the failure to 
13 meet a service quality requirement is due to factors within the control of the price cap 
14 ILEC, the commission shall, by order, direct the price cap ILEC to take such steps as the 
15 commission determines necessary to meet the requirement. If the provider fails to comply 
16 with the commission's order, the commission shall impose a penalty in accordance with 
17 section 1508-A, subsection 1, paragraph A in an amount sufficient to ensure compliance 
18 with that order. Nothing in this subsection limits the commission's authority to direct a 
19 price cap ILEC to act to improve service under any other provision of this chapter. 
20 Sec. 6. Rules. The Public Utilities Commission shall provisionally adopt major 
21 substantive rules, as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 5, chapter 375, 
22 subchapter 2-A, to implement Title 35-A, section 7221, subsections 4 to 6 by January 1,

26 section 7225, subsection 3, rules adopted pursuant to the commission's review under this 
27 section are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.

34 list municipalities in which the obligation to provide provider of last resort service has 
35 ceased pursuant to Title 35-A, section 7221, subsection 4, paragraph B or in which the 
36 ' commission has approved in accordance with Title 35-A, section 7221, subsection 5 the

Potential current biennium revenue increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Minor cost increase -Other Special Revenue Funds 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Any additional costs to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to conduct public meetings, examine service quality 
reports of a price cap incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) and conduct rulemaking are expected to be minor and 
can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources. The bill requires the PUC to impose a penalty on a price cap 
ILEC if it fails to comply with a PUC order concerning service quality requirements. There is no estimate at this time 
on the amount of revenue to the PUC that would be generated by these penalties.
