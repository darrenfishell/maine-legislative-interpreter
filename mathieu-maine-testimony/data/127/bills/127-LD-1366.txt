the dealer or redemption center to commingle beverage containers of like product 24 
group, material and size.  A commingling agreement is qualif ied for purposes of this 25 
paragraph if the department determines that 50% or more of the beverage containers 26 
of like product group, material and size for which the deposits are being initiated in 27 
the State are covered by the commingling agreement or that th e initiators of deposit 28 
covered by the commingling agreement are initiators of deposit for wine containers 29 
who each sell no more than 100,000 gallons of wine or 500,000 beverage containers 30 
that contain wine in a calendar year.  Once the initiator of deposi t has established a 31 
qualified commingling agreement for containers of a like product group, material and 32 
size, the department shall allow additional brands to be included from a different 33 
product group if they are of like material.  The State, through the Department of 34 
Administrative and Financial Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery 35 
Operations, shall make every reasonable effort to enter into a qualified commingling 36 
agreement under this paragraph with every other initiator of deposit for bev erage 37 
containers that are of like product group, size and material as the beverage containers 38 
for which the State is the initiator of deposit.  39 
D.  Paragraphs A, B and C do not apply to a brewer who annually produces no more 40 
than 50,000 gallons of its produ ct or a bottler of water who annually sells no more 41

50,000 gallons of its product or a bottler of water who annually sells no more than 45

 Page 10 - 127LR0541(01) -1 
 reimburse the dealer or local redemption center for the cost of handling beverage 1

8.  Obligation to pick up containers.  The obligation to pick up beverage containers 4 
subject to this chapter is determined as follows.  5 
A.  A distributor that initiates the deposit under section 3103, subsection 2 or 4 has 6 
the obligation to pick up any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage 7 
containers of the particular kind, size and brand sold by the distributor from deale rs to 8 
whom that distributor has sold those beverages and from licensed redemption centers 9 
designated to serve those dealers pursuant to an order entered under section 3109.  A 10 
distributor that, within this State, sells beverages under a particular label ex clusively 11 
to one dealer, which dealer offers those labeled beverages for sale at retail 12 
exclusively at the dealer's establishment, shall pick up any empty, unbroken and 13 
reasonably clean beverage containers of the kind, size and brand sold by the 14 
distributo r to the dealer only from those licensed redemption centers that serve the 15 
various establishments of the dealer, under an order entered under section 3109.  A 16 
dealer that manufactures its own beverages for exclusive sale by that dealer at retail 17 
has the ob ligation of a distributor under this section.  The commissioner may 18 
establish by rule, in accordance with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, 19 
criteria prescribing the manner in which distributors shall fulfill the obligations 20 
imposed by this paragraph.   The rules may establish a minimum number or value of 21 
containers below which a distributor is not required to respond to a request to pick up 22 
empty containers.  Any rules adopted under this paragraph must allocate the burdens 23 
associated with the handling,  storage and transportation of empty containers to 24 
prevent unreasonable financial or other hardship.  25 
B.  The initiator of the deposit under section 3103, subsection 3 has the obligation to 26 
pick up any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage container s of the 27 
particular kind, size and brand sold by the initiator from dealers to whom a distributor 28 
has sold those beverages and from licensed redemption centers designated to serve 29 
those dealers pursuant to an order entered under section 3109.  The obligati on may be 30 
fulfilled by the initiator directly or indirectly through a contracted agent.  31 
C.  An initiator of the deposit under section 3103, subsection 2, 3 or 4 has the 32 
obligation to pick up any empty, unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers 33 
that are commingled pursuant to a commingling agreement along with any beverage 34 
containers that the initiator is otherwise obligated to pick up pursuant to paragraphs A 35 
and B.  36 
D.  The initiator of deposit or initiators of deposit who are members of a 37 
commingli ng agreement have the obligation under this subsection to pick up empty, 38 
unbroken and reasonably clean beverage containers of the particular kind, size and 39 
brand sold by the initiator from dealers to whom a distributor has sold those 40 
beverages and from lic ensed redemption centers designated to serve those dealers 41 
every 15 days.  The initiator of deposit or initiators of deposit who are members of a 42 
commingling agreement have the obligation to make additional pickups when a 43 
redemption center has collected 10 ,000 beverage containers from that initiator of 44 
 
 Page 11 - 127LR0541(01) -1 
 deposit or from the initiators of deposit who are members of a commingling 1 
agreement.  2 
The obligation of the initiator of the deposit under this subsection may be fulfilled by the 3 
initiator directly or through  a party with which it has entered into a commingling 4 
agreement.  A contracted agent hired to pick up beverage containers for one or more 5 
initiators of deposit is deemed to have made a pickup at a redemption center for those 6 
initiators of deposit when it p icks up beverage containers belonging to those initiators of 7 
deposit.  8 
9.  Plastic bags.  A dealer or redemption center has an obligation to pick up plastic 9 
bags that are used by that dealer or redemption center to contain beverage containers.  10 
Plastic bags  used by a dealer or redemption center and the cost allocation of these bags 11 
must conform to rules adopted by the department concerning size and gauge.  Rules 12 
adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 13 
chapter 37 5, subchapter 2 -A. 14 
10.  Application to containers originally sold in the State.  The obligations to 15 
accept or take empty beverage containers and to pay the refund value and handling fees 16 
for such containers as described in subsections 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 appl y only to containers 17 
originally sold in this State as filled beverage containers.  A person who tenders to a 18

that the person knows or has reason to know were not origi nally sold in this State as filled 20 
beverage containers is subject to the enforcement action and civil penalties set forth in 21 
this subsection.  At each location where consumers tender containers for redemption, 22 
dealers and redemption centers must conspicuou sly display a sign in letters that are at 23

time to a dealer or redemption center must provide to the dealer or redemption center 36 
that person’s name and address and the license plate number of the vehicle used to 37 
transport the beverage containers. The dealer or redemption center redeeming these 38 
beverage containers shall forward that information to the department within 10 days , 39 
and the information must be kept on file for a minimum of 12 months.  40 
B.  After complying at least once with the requirements of paragraph A, a person 41 
need not comply with paragraph A each subsequent time that person tenders to a 42 
dealer or redemption cent er for redemption more than 2,500 beverage containers if:  43 
 
 Page 12 - 127LR0541(01) -1 
 (1)  All of the containers were collected at one location in this State;  1 
(2)  All proceeds of the refund value benefit a nonprofit organization that has 2 
been determined by the United States Internal  Revenue Service to be exempt 3 
from taxation under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 4 
501(c)(3); and  5 
(3)  The person tendering the containers for redemption signs a declaration 6 
indicating the person’s name, the address of the collectio n point and the name of 7 
the organization or organizations that will receive the refund value.  8

redemption center or retailer more than 48 empty beverage containers that the person 12 
knows or has reason to know were not originally sold in this State as fi lled beverage 13 
containers.  If the initiator of deposit prevails in any action, the initiator of deposit is 14 
entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, including expert witness 15 
fees. 16
