an application for an agency liquor store license at some or all of those stores, the bureau 
may waive the requirement of subsection 2-C, paragraph A. The bureau may provide this 
waiver only if the applicant has held a license in another state to sell malt liquor and wine

the application, without a violation of the laws governing the sale of alcoholic beverages 
in that state and can provide the bureau with documentation of financial success as 
determined by the bureau. The bureau may not provide this waiver when issuing an 
additional liquor store license in a municipality with a population of less than 10,000

SUMMARY 
This amendment clarifies that the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services, Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations may license one agency 
liquor store in a municipality with a population of less than 2,000. This amendment also 
authorizes the bureau to issue one additional liquor store license in a municipality with a 
population of less than 10,000, instead of 5,000 as in the bill, and to consider the impact 
of seasonal popUlation or tourism when determining whether to issue the additional 
license. Finally, this amendment specifies that a waiver from time requirements does not 
apply to certain applicants for an additional liquor store license in a municipality that 
already has the authorized number of liquor store licenses.
