 Sec. 1.  Department of Education to establish the Maine Summer Success 1 
Program.  Resolved:  That the Department of Education shall develop and establish 2 
the Maine Summer Success Program, using traditional and alternative teaching methods, 3 
to ensure that ev ery secondary student has access to a high -quality extended school 4 
program.  The department shall encourage school districts to implement the Maine 5 
Summer Success Program in order to address the needs of children who fail to meet 6 
grade -level proficiency st andards.  In developing this program, the department shall:  7 
1.  Put into place at the end of the freshman year for all Maine public secondary 8 
school students the use of a suite of tests that determines a studentâ€™s knowledge in 9 
mathematics, reading and writ ing with the goal of preparing the student to enroll in 10 
college -level courses.  If a student is not at the correct grade level based on the results of 11 
the tests, the student is eligible to be part of the Maine Summer Success Program,  a 12 
district -based summ er school program that offers students the opportunity of alternative 13 
or online coursework; and  14 
2.  Explore the use of social impact bonds to fund the Maine Summer Success 15 
Program.  For the purpose of this resolve, "social impact bond" means a performance - 16 
based bond that operates over a fixed period of time in which repayment to an investor is 17 
contingent upon the achievement of a desired social outcome.  When funds are secured, 18 
the Department of Education, through a grant application process, shall provide funding 19 
to cover 90% of the costs of extended school year programs in districts with greater than 20 
50% student participation in the free and reduced lunch rate program.  Any remaining 21 
available funds must be provided to districts with greater than 35% free and reduced 22 
lunch participation rates; and be it further  23

development of the Maine Summer Success Program under section 1 to the Joint 25 
Standing Committee on Education and Cult ural Affairs by December 2, 2015.  The Joint 26 
Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs may submit a bill related to this 27 
report to the Second Regular Session of the 127th Legislature.  28
