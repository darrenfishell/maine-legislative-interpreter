Governor shall proclaim the result without delay and this Act becomes effective 30 days

6 SUMMARY 
7 This amendment, which is the minority report, repeals the public law that enacted 
8 Maine's genetically modified food products labeling law, which only takes effect if 
9 mandatory labeling is adopted by at least 5 contiguous states, including Maine. This 
10 amendment instead enacts the labeling law contingent on approval by the voters in a 
11 referendum at the general election in November.

Month/Year Election Type Question 
Nov-16 General Referendum Length 
Standard 
The Secretary of State's budget includes sufficient funds to accommodate one ballot of average length for the general 
election in November. If the number or size of the referendum questions requires production and delivery of a second 
ballot, an additional appropriation of $107,250 may be required. 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Under current law, PL 2013, c. 436 requires that if at least five contiguous states, including Maine, adopt l,egislation 
requiring mandatory labeling of genetically engineered food by January 1, 2018, then food offered for retail sale that 
is genetically engineered requires disclosure. This bill, instead, makes PL 2013, c. 436 contingent on approval by the 
voters at a statewide election in November 2016. If approved by the voters at a statewide election, the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry would require a General Fund appropriation of $83,798 in fiscal year 2016-17 
for one Consumer Protection Inspector position, one Office Associate II position and other related costs.
