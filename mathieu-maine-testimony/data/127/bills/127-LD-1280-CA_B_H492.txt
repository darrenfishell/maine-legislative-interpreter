SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill and is a minority report of the committee. The 
amendment establishes a competitive bid process for the operation of a resort-style casino 
in either York County or Cumberland County. The amendment establishes the Casino 
Development Commission, which is an independent board of 5 members appointed by 
the Governor and confim1ed by the Senate. The commission's purpose is to develop a 
request for proposals for the privilege to submit an application to the Gambling Control 
Board for a casino operator license. The fee to submit a bid is $250,000. The 
amendment provides for specific supporting infonnation to be submitted by the bidder 
and considered by the commission including the bidder's ability to make a minimum 
$250,000,000 capital investment in the resort-style casino and information regarding job 
creation, economic devc;lopment and plans to mitigate negative infrastructure impacts. 
Under the amendment, the commission is directed to develop a point system for the 
factors to be considered and give priority to factors that create Jobs, promote economic 
development, increase tourism am,! support a casino that fits the character of the State, 
with job creation and economic development being the highest priorities. The winning 
bidder must enter into a contract with the commission that obligates the casino operator to 
abide by the proposals made in the winning bid. Failure to abide by the tenl1S of the 
contract could result in financial penalties to the operator. 
The license fee for a casino under the amendment is $10,000,000, which is deposited 
into an account to be used to mitigate the impact oflost revenue on the municipalities and 
a county in which casinos are currently located due to the operation of the new resort­
style casino. Under the amendment, the Gambling Control Board will distribute money 
from the account to the municipalities and county based on past distribution amounts the 
municipalities and county had been receiving from the casino, with the intent of 
maintaining the same revenue stream. 
The amendment sets the distribution of net slot machine revenue at 40% and the 
distribution of net table game revenue at 16% for the resOli-style casino. Table game 
revenues would be deposited into a fund to develop a coordinated system of delivery of 
services and benefits to Maine veterans. Upon operation of slot machines at the resOli­
style casino, the board will hold distributions required of existing casinos until the

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
The bill establishes the Fund to Reform Veterans Services in the Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency 
Services with a base Other Special Revenue Funds (OSRF) allocation of$500 beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 in 
order to allow the department to spend any monies received. 
The bill creates a commission to use a competitive bid process to award the privilege to apply for the operation of a 
resort-style casino. Bidders will pay a $250,000 bidding fee to win the right to be the applicant. The fiscal note 
assumes this will be credited to the General Fund. The Gambling Control Board (GCB) will accept applications for a 
casino license in either York County or Cumberland County from the winning bidder as long as the voters of the 
municipality where the proposed casino will be located have voted to approve a casino'. Only one casino, in either 
York or Cumberland County, may be licensed. 
The facility would be taxed at the rate of 40% of net slot income and 16% of net table game income, The bill requires 
a casino, beginning no sooner than 5 years after operation of slot machines, to make capital improvements to the 
casino using 3% to 4% of both net slot machine and net table game income or direct those funds to the GCB, This 
fiscal note assumes that the facility will not direct these funds to the GCB. This fiscal note assumes a total of 1,000 
slot machines and 24 table games, generating an estimated annual revenue of $27,158,628 to the GCB and $1,735,181 
to the Fund to Reform Veterans Services.

Each non-refundable bid proposal will generate $250,000 in General Fund revenue. The casino operator license is 
$10,000,000 in OSRF revenue in the first year of the casino's operation. The $10,000,000 will be used to provide 
revenue to host municipalities and counties receiving distributions from either Hollywood Casino or Oxford Casino. 
$250,000 in OSRF revenue will be generated in the fifth year of the casino's operation from the renewal fee for the 
casino operator license. $102,400, will be generated annually from the registration fees of $1 00 per slot machine and 
per table game. Annual State costs associated with 5 inspectors, an auditor and other related expenses are estimated 
to be $523,510. 
WhiteSand Gaming's market feasibility study on expanded gaming in Maine estimated a 20% reduction in revenue to 
Oxford Casino if a new southern Maine casino were to open. This fiscal note assumes the same 20% reduction, 
resulting in an estimated annual General Fund revenue loss of $347,495 and OSRF revenue loss of $5,41 0,437. An 
assessment of the impact on revenues generated by Hollywood Casino has not been done at this time. 
Under current law, State revenue from both Oxford Casino and Hollywood Casino go to various funds, but this bill 
directs all State revenue from these casinos to go to the GCB until a.distribution of slot machine and table game 
revenue is established by the Legislature. The new distribution is required to be a uniform distribution of slot machine 
and table game revenue to each casino, slot machine facility or gambling facility. This results in an estimated annual 
General Fund revenue decrease of$8,223,744 and an annual OSRF revenue increase of$8,223,744.
