SUMMARY  28 
This bill defines "genetically modified product," which includes genetically 29 
engineered seed stock, products from animals fed genetically engineered food and 30 
medicines that were manufactured with genetically engineered plants or animals to the 31 
laws regarding the labeling of genetically engineered products.  It requires the disclosure 32 
of genet ic engineering of food, seed stock, products from animals fed genetically 33 
engineered food or medicines that were manufactured with genetically engineered plants 34 
or animals beginning January 1, 2017.  It provides that food, seed stock, products from 35 
animals  fed genetically engineered food and medicines for which the disclosure is not 36 
made are considered to be misbranded and subject to the sanctions for misbranding. The 37 
bill removes exemptions for products produced without knowledge that the products, or 38 
items used in their production, were genetically engineered; animal products derived from 39 
 
 Page 3 - 127LR1 258(01) -1 
 an animal that was not genetically engineered but was fed genetically engineered food; 1 
and products with only a minimum content produced by genetic engineering. The bill also 2 
removes the exemption from disclosure requirements as regards restaurants, alcoholic 3 
beverages or medical food. This bill increases the penalties for nondisclosure and 4 
misbranding to a Class E crime for the first offense and a Class D crime for the 2n d and 5 
subsequent offenses.  The bill repeals the contingent effective date established by Public 6 
Law 2013, chapter 436, section 2, subsection 1.  7
