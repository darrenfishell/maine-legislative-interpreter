witness fees.

Fiscal Detail and Notes 
This amendment makes certain changes to the stewardship program for batteries contained in the committee 
amendment and makes this stewardship program effective only upon the adoption of substantially consistent 
legislation by at least five contiguous states, including Maine. The stewardship program for batteries will be repealed 
on January 1, 2024 if it has not become effective before this date. Any potential impact on costs and revenues cannot 
be determined at this time. This fiscal note assumes that the fees contained in the committee amendment, a fee ofup 
to $25,000 on applicants to review submissions of plans and an annual fee ofup to $25,000 on operators of the 
program, are sufficient to cover the Department of Environmental Protection's costs. 
As amended, the bill still includes a $40,000 appropriation to the Department of Administrative and Financial 
Services to establish a food waste composting pilot program.
