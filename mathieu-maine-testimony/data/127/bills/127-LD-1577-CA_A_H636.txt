the defendant's competence to stand trial and its reasons. The Commissioner of 
Health and Human Services shall without delay file the report with the court having 
jurisdiction of the case. The court shall hold a hearing on the question of the 
defendant's competence to stand trial and receive all relevant testimony bearing on 
the question. If the State Forensic Service's report or the report of another

defendant will be competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future, the court shall 
recommit the defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human 
Services for placement in an appropriate program for observation, care and treatment 
of people with mental illness or persons with intellectual disabilities or autism. An

accreditation by a nationally recognized health care organization accrediting body 
whose standards for accreditation meet or exceed the requirements for a health care 
facility to be eligible to receive payment from the Medicare or Medicaid program if a 
suitable bed is available. If a suitable bed is not available in a state mental health 
institute or at an in-state facility that possesses accreditation by a nationally 
recognized health care organization accrediting body whose standards for 
accreditation meet or exceed the requirements for a health care facility to be eligible 
to receive payment from the Medicare or Medicaid program, the Commissioner of 
Health and Human Services shall place the defendant at an out-of-state facility that at 
the time of placement possesses accreditation by a nationally recognized health care

body whose standards for accreditation meet or exceed the requirements for a health care 
facility to be eligible to receive payment from the Medicare or Medicaid program, the 
Commissioner of Health and Human Services shall place the person at an out-of-state

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to create priorities for placement of certain 
individuals in the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services. The bill also requires that the DHHS, 
by December 31, 2016, shall develop a facility separate from the Riverview Psychiatric Center that will provide the 
least restrictive setting possible for forensic patients in the custody of the Commissioner of Health and Human 
Services and for whom the DHHS verified a hospital level of care is no longer needed. For comparison, the DHHS 
currently has a contract with an out of state provider to provide this service to similar individuals at a cost of $494 per 
bed per day. It is not known at this time how many total beds would be needed, what staffing levels would be or when 
it is feasible to assume this unit would be created. Some federal money may be available to offset some of the staffing 
costs of a new facility. Construction of a facility would be a cost of the General Fund. No estimate of the increased 
cost can be made at this time. 
This bill also requires the DHHS, by August 1, 2016 and at least every ninety days thereafter, to submit a written 
report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over the State's psychiatric hospitals. Any 
additional costs to the DHHS to fulfill these reporting requirements are expected to be minor and can be absorbed 
within existing budgeted resources.
