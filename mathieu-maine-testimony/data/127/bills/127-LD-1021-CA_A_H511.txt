9 COMMITTEE AMENDMENT "A " to H.P. 704, L.D. 1021, Bill, "An Act To 
10 Amend the Laws Pertaining to the Maine Public Employees Retirement System" 
11 Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
12 following: 
13 'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
14 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
15 Whereas, the intent of the Legislature in Public Law 2015, chapter 267, the so-
16 called biennial budget, was to include language permitting members of the Maine Public 
17 Employees Retirement System who were subject to a merit pay and longevity pay freeze 
18 in fiscal year 2011-12 and fiscal year 2012-13 to include those lost wages in their 
19 retirement benefit calculations by paying the necessary member contributions; and 
20 Whereas, the language included in Public Law 2015, chapter 267 as enacted 
21 inadvertently omitted fiscal year 2011-12; and 
22 Whereas, this legislation includes language to correct the error and allow those 
23 members affected to receive their full benefit in a more timely manner; and 
24 Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
25 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
26 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
27 therefore,' 
28 Amend the bill by striking out all of sections 2 and 3 and inserting the following: 
29 'Sec. 2. 5 MRSA §17001, sub-§4, 1A, as amended by PL 2009, c. 630, §1, is 
30 further amended to read:

32 of creditable service as an employee in Maine, not necessarily consecutive, in which 
33 the member's annual rate of earnable compensation is highest. However, if a member

the freezing of merit pay and longevity pay during fiscal year 2002-03, 2009-10, 2010-11.,_ 
2011-12 or 2012-13, or a combination thereof, as provided in section 17001, subsection 
4, paragraph A, plus interest at a rate, to be set by the board, not to exceed regular interest

Amend the bill by adding before the summary the following: 
'Emergency clause. In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this 
legislation takes effect when approved.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or 
section number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment removes the provisions in the bill that clarify the authority and 
responsibilities of the Board of Trustees of the Maine Public Employees Retirement 
System with respect to eligibility and membership issues that arise in the context of the 
Participating Local District Retirement Program. 
This amendment also corrects an oversight in Public Law 2015, chapter 267, Part 
CCCC. The intent of the legislation was to permit members who were subject to a merit 
pay and longevity pay freeze in fiscal year 2011-12 and fiscal year 2012-13 to include 
those lost wages in their retirement benefit calculations by paying the necessary member 
contributions. As enacted, the legislation inadvertently omitted fiscal year 2011-12. 
This amendment adds an emergency preamble and emergency clause to the bill.
