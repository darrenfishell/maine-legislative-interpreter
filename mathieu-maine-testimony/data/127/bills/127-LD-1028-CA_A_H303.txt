FIRST REGULAR SESSION 
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT ,.(1" to H.P. 711, L.D. 1028, Bill, "An Act To 
Clarify Laws Concerning the Registration of Professional Engineers" 
Amend the bill by striking out the title and substituting the following: 
'An Act To Amend the Laws Concerning the Registration of Professional Engineers' 
Amend the bill by inserting after the title and before the enacting clause the 
following: 
'Emergency preamble. Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and 
Whereas, the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers currently lacks 
the statutory ability to provide an equitable solution for licensure renewal that does not 
unfairly burden a licensee whose license has lapsed prior to renewal and who was 
licensed under a prior experience-based pathway to licensure; and 
Whereas, this legislation will restore fairness to the statutes governing the State 
Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers by providing the board with the discretion 
to waive overly burdensome renewal requirements and should be enacted immediately in 
order to protect engineers who are in danger of losing their licenses; and 
Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
the meanin g of the Constitution of Maine and require the follmving legislation as 
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
therefore, ' 
Amend the bill by striking out all of section 1 and inserting the following: 
'Sec. 1. 32 MRSA ยง1357, as amended by PL 2013, c. 296, ยง6, is further amended

and instead provides the board with the authority to waive additional qualifications upon 
renewal if the licensee meets specific criteria. The amendment replaces continuing 
education requirements with professional development requirements and increases the 
renewal fee cap from $50 to $200. It also adds an emergency preamble and emergency 
clause to the bill.
