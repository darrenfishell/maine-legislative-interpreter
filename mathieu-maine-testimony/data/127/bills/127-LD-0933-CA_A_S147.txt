This legislation establishes a new position to increase communication and cooperation between the Department of Education and 
the Department of Health and Human Services and to monitor child hunger and nutrition programs in both departments. It also 
requires the departments to provide school administrative units and schools with analyses of existing child hunger and nutrition 
programs and the funding not being used. The Department of Education has indicated that a Planning & Research Associate II 
position will be needed to perfonn these duties as well as to provide staffing services to the Commission to End Student Hunger. 
This bill includes General Fund appropriations of $80,255 in fiscal year 2015-16 and $80,842 in fiscal year 2016-17 to the School 
Finance and Operations program within the Department of Education to support the personal services and all other costs of the 
position. Other Special Revenue Funds base allocations of $500 per year beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 are provided to 
establish an account for the Commission to End Student Hunger within the Department of Education that can be used to accept 
contributions and other sources of funds to support the work of the commission and 4 privately funded hunger coordinators. 
This bill also includes General Fund appropriations of $500 per year beginning in fiscal year 2015-16 to the Legislature for the 
per diem costs and other expenses of one member of the Senate and one member of the House of Representatives to participate in 
up to 4 meetings of the Commission to End Student Hunger during each interim period. 
Any additional costs to the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt the changes in this bill are expected to be minor 
and can be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
