 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:  1 
Sec. 1.  39-A MRSA ยง328 -C is enacted to read:  2 
ยง328 -C.  Heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer  3 
Heart disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer is governed  by this 4 
section.  5 
1.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 6 
following terms have the following meanings.  7 
A.  "Corrections officer" means an employee of the State or of a county whose place 8 
of employment is a cor rectional facility as defined in Title 34 -A, section 1001, 9 
subsection 6 or a county detention facility under Title 34 -A, section 1208 or 1208 -A 10 
and who is responsible for the care, custody or direct supervision of a person 11 
confined in a jail, prison or sta te correctional facility pursuant to an order of a court 12 
or as a result of an arrest.  13 
B.  "Heart disease" means a structural or functional abnormality of the heart, or of the 14 
blood vessels supplying the heart, that impairs the heart's normal functioning.  15 
C.  "Hypertension" means a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in 16 
the arteries is elevated.  17 
2.  Presumption.  If a corrections officer who contracts heart disease or hypertension 18 
has met the requirements of subsections 3, 6 and 7, there is  a rebuttable presumption that 19 
the corrections officer contracted the heart disease or hypertension in the course of 20 
employment as a corrections officer and as a result of that employment, that sufficient 21 
notice of the heart disease or hypertension has bee n given and that the heart disease or 22 
hypertension was not occasioned by any willful act of the corrections officer to cause the 23 
heart disease or hypertension.  24 
3.  Medical tests.  In order to be entitled to the presumption in subsection 2, during 25 
the time of employment as a corrections officer, the corrections officer must have 26 
undergone a standard, medically acceptable test for evidence of the heart disease or 27 
hypertension for which the presumption is sought or evidence of the medical conditions 28 
derived fr om the heart disease or hypertension, which test failed to indicate the presence 29 
or condition of heart disease or hypertension.  30 
4.  Liability if services performed for more than one employer.  If a corrections 31 
officer who contracts heart disease or hyperte nsion was employed as a corrections officer 32 
by more than one employer and qualifies for the presumption under subsection 2, and that 33 
presumption has not been rebutted, the employer and insurer at the time of the last 34 
substantial exposure to the risk of the  heart disease or hypertension are liable under this 35 
Part. 36 
5.  Retired corrections officer.  This section applies to a corrections officer who is 37 
diagnosed with heart disease or hypertension within 10 years of the corrections officer's 38 
 
 Page 2 - 127LR1439(01) -1 
 last active employme nt as a corrections officer or prior to attaining 70 years of age, 1 
whichever occurs first.  2 
6.  Length of service.  In order to qualify for the presumption under subsection 2, the 3 
corrections officer must have been employed as a corrections officer for 5 ye ars. 4 
7.  Written verification.  In order to qualify for the presumption under subsection 2, 5 
a corrections officer must sign a written affidavit declaring, to the best of the corrections 6 
officer's knowledge and belief, that the corrections officer's diagnos ed heart disease or 7 
hypertension is not prevalent among the corrections officer's blood -related parents, 8 
grandparents or siblings and that the corrections officer has no substantial lifetime habits 9 
or personal activities that are associated with the correc tions officer's diagnosed heart 10 
disease or hypertension.  11 
SUMMARY  12 
This bill amends the workers' compensation laws by adding a presumption that heart 13 
disease or hypertension suffered by a corrections officer was caused in the course of 14 
employment as a correc tions officer, similar to the provisions presuming that cancer 15 
contracted by a firefighter was caused by exposure to carcinogens through firefighting 16 
duties.  17
