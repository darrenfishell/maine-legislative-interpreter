COMMITTEE AMENDMENT" A "to S.P. 666,L.D. 1639 
SUMMARY 
2 This amendment removes from the bill the requirement that the Judicial Branch pay 
3 all bail commissioner fees. The Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has 
4 committed to establishing a working group to address the challenges of the current bail 
5 system, including the issue of bail commissioner fees. 
6 This amendment deletes from the bill the proposal that jail employees can prepare 
7 and execute a personal recognizance bond when a bail commissioner orders bail. 
8 This amendment deletes from the bill the language eliminating the use of unsecured 
9 appearance bonds, therefore retaining the possibility that unsecured appearance bonds can 
10 be used. 
11 This amendment deletes from the bill the requirement that the State pay the costs of 
12 supervision of a defendant when a defendant is released pretrial under the supervision of 
13 an organization that provides supervision and ensures the appearance of the defendant, 
14 and instead requires each county to maintain a pretrial release program or contract with 
15 an organization to supervise defendants subject to a pretrial release condition using the 
16 community corrections funds provided from the County Jail Operations Fund. 
17 This amendment expands the opportunity for community service work for credit 
18 against unpaid fines to include Class C crime convictions. Current law allows public 
19 service work for credit against unpaid fines only for Class D and Class E crimes. 
20 This amendment requires counties to use at least a portion of the community 
21 corrections funds they currently receive under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 34-A, 
22 section 1210-D to provide pretrial and conditional release programs when imposed as a 
23 condition of pretrial bail. The programs may be conducted by the counties or under a 
24 contract with one or more organizations that provide such supervision. The Supreme 
25 Judicial Court may adopt rules or orders that establish the requirements of the programs 
26 to ensure that defendants have substantially equal access to pretrial and conditional 
27 release across the State.
