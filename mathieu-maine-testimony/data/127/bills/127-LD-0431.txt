 SUMMARY  1 
This bill expands the crime of stalking to include conduct directed at or concerning a 2 
group of persons.  This new classification of stalking is a Class C crime, as opposed to a 3 
Class D crime for stalking a single i ndividual.  This bill also changes the escalation of 4 
criminal penalties for subsequent convictions of stalking, with one prior conviction for 5 
stalking or violation of a protective order sufficient to enhance penalties, as opposed to 6 
the current 2 prior con victions.  Subsequent convictions are still a Class C crime, but the 7 
bill adds a mandatory minimum sentence of one year.  Prior conviction of stalking a 8 
group of persons escalates the penalty to that for a Class B crime, with a mandatory 9 
minimum sentence o f 2 years.  10
