33Sec. 2.  30 MRSA §6202, as enacted by PL 1979, c. 732, §§1 and 31, is amended to 
34 read:
35§6202.  Legislative findings and declaration of policy
36 The Legislature finds and declares the following.
37 The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet 
38 Indians are asserting asserted claims for possession of large areas of land in the State and 
39 for damages alleging that the lands in question originally were transferred by treaty in 
40 violation of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, 1 Stat. 137, or subsequent 
41 reenactments or versions thereof.
Page 2 - 130LR1341(01)1 Substantial At the time, the prospect that these claims would not be promptly resolved 
2 threatened to create substantial economic and social hardship could be created for large 
3 numbers of landowners, citizens and communities in the State, and therefore to the State as 
4 a whole, if these claims are not resolved promptly.
5 The claims also have produced disagreement between the Indian claimants and the 
6 State over the extent of the state's State's jurisdiction in the claimed areas. This 
7 disagreement has resulted in litigation and, if the claims are had not been resolved, further 
8 litigation on jurisdictional issues would be have been likely.
9 The In the late 1970s, the Indian claimants and the State, acting through the Attorney 
10 General, have reached certain agreements which represent that represented a good faith 
11 effort on the part of all parties to achieve a fair and just resolution of those claims which  
12 that, in the absence of agreement, would be have been pursued through the courts for many 
13 years to the ultimate detriment of the State and all its citizens, including the Indians.  The 
14 resolution reached among the Indian claimants and the State affirmed the land transfers and 
15 the reservations of rights embodied within the specific treaties that gave rise to the claims 
16 at issue, and sought to definitively eliminate any prospect that the claims brought by the 
17 Indian claimants would cloud private title to land in the State.
18 The foregoing agreement between the Indian claimants and the State also represents a 
19 good faith effort by the Indian claimants and the State to achieve a just and fair resolution 
20 of their disagreement over jurisdiction on the present Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Indian 
21 reservations and in the claimed areas. To that end, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the 
22 Penobscot Nation have agreed to adopt the laws of the State as their own to the extent 
23 provided in this Act. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be wholly 
24 subject to the laws of the State.
25 It is the purpose of this Act to implement in part the foregoing agreement.
261.  Rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities.  The purpose of the 
27 amendments to this Act enacted in 2021 is to establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the 
28 Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians enjoy rights, privileges, 
29 powers, duties and immunities similar to those of other federally recognized Indian tribes 
30 within the United States.
312.  Federal Indian law applies.  Except as otherwise specified in this Act, the State, 
32 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians 
33 agree and intend pursuant to United States Public Law 96-420 and hereby recognize and 
34 adopt the application of federal Indian law with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, 
35 duties and immunities of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton 
36 Band of Maliseet Indians, including laws and regulations of the United States enacted for 
37 the benefit of Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians and laws and regulations 
38 that accord a special status or right to or that relate to a special status or right of any Indian, 
39 Indian nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, 
40 Indian territory or land held in trust for Indians.
41Sec. 3.  30 MRSA §6203, as amended by PL 2009, c. 636, Pt. B, §1 and affected by

12 of the State. Before conducting any such survey the commissioner shall provide reasonable 
13 advance notice to the respective tribe or nation and afford it a reasonable opportunity to 
14 participate in such survey. If the commissioner, at any time, has reasonable grounds to 
15 believe that a tribal ordinance or commission regulation adopted under this section, or the 
16 absence of such a tribal ordinance or commission regulation, is adversely affecting or is 
17 likely to adversely affect the stock of any fish or wildlife on lands or waters outside the 
18 boundaries of land or waters subject to regulation by the commission, the Passamaquoddy

22 fail, he may call a public hearing to investigate the matter further. Any such hearing shall 
23 be conducted in a manner consistent with the laws of the State applicable to adjudicative 
24 hearings. If, after hearing, the commissioner determines that any such ordinance, rule or 
25 regulation, or the absence of an ordinance, rule or regulation, is causing, or there is a 
26 reasonable likelihood that it will cause, a significant depletion of fish or wildlife stocks on 
27 lands or waters outside the boundaries of lands or waters subject to regulation by the 
28 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation or the commission, he may adopt appropriate 
29 remedial measures including rescission of any such ordinance, rule or regulation and, in 
30 lieu thereof, order the enforcement of the generally applicable laws or regulations of the 
31 State. In adopting any remedial measures the commission shall utilize the least restrictive 
32 means possible to prevent a substantial diminution of the stocks in question and shall take 
33 into consideration the effect that non-Indian practices on non-Indian lands or waters are 
34 having on such stocks. In no event shall such remedial measure be more restrictive than 
35 those which the commissioner could impose if the area in question was not within Indian 
36 territory or waters subject to commission regulation.
37 In any administrative proceeding under this section the burden of proof shall be on the 
38 commissioner. The decision of the commissioner may be appealed in the manner provided 
39 by the laws of the State for judicial review of administrative action and shall be sustained 
40 only if supported by substantial evidence.

42 or in waters subject to commission regulation and wildlife lawfully taken within on Indian 
43 territory or trust land and registered pursuant to ordinances adopted by the Passamaquoddy

27 State.
284.  Double jeopardy, ; collateral estoppel.  A prosecution for a criminal offense crime 
29 or juvenile crime over which the Passamaquoddy Tribe has exclusive jurisdiction under

35 offense crime over which the State has concurrent jurisdiction under this section does not 
36 bar a prosecution for a criminal offense  crime, arising out of the same conduct, over which

38 crime or juvenile crime over which the State has exclusive jurisdiction does not bar a

41 determination of an issue of fact in a criminal or juvenile proceeding conducted in a 
42 Passamaquoddy tribal forum does not constitute collateral estoppel in a criminal or juvenile

33SUMMARY
34 This bill implements the consensus recommendations of the Task Force on Changes to 
35 the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Implementing Act, referred to in this summary as "the 
36 task force."  The report was released on January 14, 2020 and is available online at 
37 http://legislature.maine.gov/maine-indian-claims-tf. This bill does not address the 
38 relationship between the State and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs because that issue was 
39 specifically set aside by the task force.  In this summary, the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 
40 30, chapter 601, which is titled AN ACT to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, 
41 enacted by Public Law 1979, chapter 732, is referred to as "the Maine Implementing Act" 
42 and the federal Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, Public Law 96-420, formerly 
43 codified at 25 United States Code, Sections 1721 to 1735, is referred to as "the federal 1

Page 43 - 130LR1341(01)44 Settlement Act."  The federal Settlement Act ratified the Maine Implementing Act, and 
45 both have an effective date of October 10, 1980.
3 The purpose of the reconsideration and rewriting of the Maine Implementing Act is to 
4 establish that the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of 
5 Maliseet Indians enjoy the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities similar to those 
6 of other federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States.  This is a significant 
7 change from the current law, which provides the State with significant authority over Indian 
8 affairs.  To carry out this significant change, many provisions of Title 30, chapter 601 are 
9 repealed or amended to recognize that federal Indian law governs the rights, privileges, 
10 powers, duties and immunities of the tribe, nation and band. 
11 Under the bill, except as otherwise specified in the Maine Implementing Act, federal 
12 Indian law applies with regard to the rights, privileges, powers, duties and immunities of 
13 the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians.  
14 "Federal Indian law" is defined in this bill as the United States Constitution and all 
15 generally applicable federal statutes, regulations and case law and subsequent amendments 
16 thereto or judicial interpretations thereof, relating to the rights, privileges, powers, duties 
17 and immunities of federally recognized Indian tribes within the United States. This 
18 definition explicitly recognizes that federal Indian law is not static, but evolves as federal 
19 laws are passed and amended and as federal courts interpret the relevant statutes and 
20 regulations and their application to federally recognized Indian tribes, nations, bands and 
21 other groups.
22 This bill restructures the procedures for addition of new land to tribal territories and 
23 eliminates time limits for the acquisition of land. The procedures required depend upon the 
24 location of the land and the time of acquisition. For the Passamaquoddy Tribe and 
25 Penobscot Nation, newly acquired land located within the borders of a city, town, village 
26 or plantation requires the tribe or nation to enter into an agreement under which the tribe 
27 or nation agrees to make a payment in lieu of taxes to the relevant local taxing authority, 
28 to enter into an agreement for establishing law enforcement authority and to establish that 
29 land use is not contrary to existing zoning ordinances.
30 This bill eliminates the language in the Maine Implementing Act regarding takings of 
31 tribal land for public use under state law. 
32 The Maine Implementing Act currently limits the criminal jurisdiction of the 
33 Passamaquoddy Tribal Court and the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court as well as the potential 
34 criminal jurisdiction of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court. Federal Indian 
35 law provides broader jurisdiction for tribal courts.  This bill repeals most of the state 
36 limitations and recognizes and adopts most of federal Indian law, including the Indian Civil 
37 Rights Act of 1968, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 and other federal laws addressing 
38 tribal court jurisdiction and the obligations of the tribal courts.  This bill amends the Maine 
39 Implementing Act to make equal the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy 
40 Tribal Court and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Tribal Court with the exclusive 
41 criminal jurisdiction of the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court over offenses committed by 
42 Indian defendants against Indian victims or for which there is no victim.  This bill further 
43 amends the Maine Implementing Act to recognize the criminal jurisdiction of the 
44 Passamaquoddy Tribal Court, the Penobscot Nation Tribal Court and the Houlton Band of 
45 Maliseet Indians Tribal Court to impose the maximum penalties other tribal courts are 1
2
Page 44 - 130LR1341(01)46 authorized to impose under the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, as long as the 
47 due process protections required by that Act are observed.  
3 This bill amends state law to recognize tribal court jurisdiction, concurrent with the 
4 state courts, over offenses committed on tribal lands by Indian defendants against non-
5 Indian victims, subject to the maximum penalty provisions and due process requirements 
6 of the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010.  
7 This bill retains current law providing that the exclusive authority of the 
8 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians to 
9 exercise criminal jurisdiction over Indians on tribal lands remains at the discretion of the 
10 tribe, nation and band.  To the extent that the tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or 
11 terminates its exercise of, exclusive criminal jurisdiction, the State has exclusive 
12 jurisdiction over those matters. 
13 Unlike current law, this bill recognizes each tribal government's authority to define all 
14 crimes and juvenile offenses committed on its tribal lands over which the tribal court has 
15 exclusive or concurrent criminal jurisdiction.  This bill, however, retains the authority of 
16 the State to define all crimes and juvenile offenses committed on tribal lands over which 
17 state courts have exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. 
18 This bill recognizes federal Indian law regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of tribes to 
19 regulate fishing and hunting by tribal citizens of all federally recognized Indian tribes on 
20 tribal lands.  This bill amends the Maine Implementing Act to restore and affirm the 
21 exclusive jurisdiction of tribes to regulate fishing and hunting by nontribal citizens on tribal 
22 lands, but does not cede to the State any authority of the Maine Indian Tribal-State 
23 Commission to regulate fishing on boundary waters under current law. 
24 This bill relinquishes the State's jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of fishing 
25 and hunting by both tribal and nontribal citizens on tribal lands.  The State, solely for 
26 conservation purposes, may regulate tribal members engaged in such activities off tribal 
27 lands to the extent permitted under general principles of federal Indian law and in a manner 
28 consistent with reserved tribal treaty rights. 
29 This bill amends state law to recognize and adopt federal Indian law providing that: 
30 tribes have exclusive jurisdiction to tax tribal members and tribal entities on their respective 
31 tribal lands, including entities owned by a tribe or tribal member; tribes, tribal members 
32 and tribal entities are not subject to state and local sales taxation on tribal lands; tribal 
33 members who live on their respective tribal lands are not subject to state income tax  for 
34 income earned on their respective tribal lands; tribal lands are not subject to state and  local 
35 real property tax; tribes have concurrent jurisdiction to tax nonmembers on tribal lands; 
36 and the State and local governments have concurrent jurisdiction to tax nonmembers on 
37 tribal lands. It exempts tribal members and entities from sales tax for sales on, in, into, from 
38 or otherwise sourced to tribal territory or trust land. It requires the State to make payments 
39 to the Penobscot Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians of 
40 the amounts of revenue attributable to the sale tax collected on, in, into, from or otherwise 
41 sourced to their respective Indian territory or trust land, reduced by the transfer to the Local 
42 Government Fund.
43 This bill amends state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation 
44 and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians the exclusive authority to exercise civil 
45 legislative jurisdiction over Indians and non-Indians on tribal lands.  To the extent that the 1
2
Page 45 - 130LR1341(01)46 tribe, nation or band does not exercise, or terminates its exercise of, exclusive civil 
47 legislative jurisdiction, the State has exclusive jurisdiction over those matters. This bill 
48 amends state law to restore to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the 
49 Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians the exclusive authority to exercise civil adjudicatory 
50 jurisdiction over Indians and non-Indians on tribal lands.  To the extent that the tribe, nation 
51 or band does not exercise, or terminates its exercise of, exclusive civil adjudicatory 
52 jurisdiction, the State has exclusive jurisdiction over those matters. This bill amends state 
53 law to explicitly provide that, for the purposes of the federal Settlement Act, Section 6(h), 
54 any law or regulation of the United States that accords a special status or right to, or relates 
55 to a special status or right of, any Indian, Indian  nation, tribe or band of Indians, Indian 
56 lands, Indian reservations, Indian country, Indian  territory or land held in trust for Indians 
57 applies to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of 
58 Maliseet Indians and their members and is deemed not to affect or preempt the civil, 
59 criminal or regulatory jurisdiction of this State, including, without limitation, laws of this 
60 State relating to land use or environmental  matters.  
16 This bill amends state law to explicitly provide that for the purposes of the federal 
17 Settlement Act, Section 16(b), the provisions of any federal law enacted after October 10, 
18 1980, for the benefit of Indians, Indian nations or tribes or bands of Indians, apply to the 
19 Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians  
20 and their members and is deemed not to affect or preempt the application of the laws of  
21 this State, including application of the laws of this State to lands owned by or held in trust  
22 for Indians or Indian nations, tribes or bands of Indians, regardless of whether such federal 
23 law is specifically made applicable within this State.  
24 Finally, the bill establishes a process for consultation between tribes and state agencies, 
25 provides that the State may enter into cooperative agreements with tribes, provides for an 
26 annual assembly of the Governor and the tribes, provides for the development of a dispute 
27 resolution process to facilitative resolution of disputes between the State and tribes and 
28 provides for the development of an agreement to be known as "the Bicentennial Accord" 
29 to establish principles for State-tribal relations. 
30 The bill takes effect 120 days after adjournment of the First Special Session of the 
31 130th Legislature only if, within 90 days after adjournment of the First Special Session of 
32 the 130th Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification from the Joint 
33 Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe that the tribe has agreed to its provisions; the 
34 Governor and the Council of the Penobscot Nation that the nation has agreed to its 
35 provisions; and the Houlton Band Council of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians that the 
36 band has agreed to its provisions.1
