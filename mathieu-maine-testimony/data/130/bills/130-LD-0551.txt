7 c. 476, §4, is further amended by repealing subparagraph (2) and enacting the following in 
8 its place:
9 (2)  Weatherizing 17,500 homes and businesses by 2025 and 35,000 homes and 
10 businesses by 2030, including at least 1,000 units of housing for low-income 
11 individuals or households per year from 2022 to 2030; and

14 A.  Trust funds must be allocated for measures, investments, loans, technical assistance 
15 and arrangements that reduce electricity consumption, increase energy efficiency or 
16 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs at commercial or industrial 
17 facilities and for investment in measures that lower residential heating energy demand 
18 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The measures that lower residential heating 
19 demand must be fuel-neutral and may include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency 
20 improvements to residential buildings and upgrades to efficient heating systems that 
21 will reduce residential energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by 
22 the board.  The trust shall ensure that measures to reduce the cost of residential heating 
23 are available for low-income households as defined by the trust.  When promoting 
24 electricity cost and consumption reduction, the trust may consider measures at 
25 commercial and industrial facilities that also lower peak capacity demand.  Subject to 
26 the apportionment pursuant to this subsection, the trust shall fund conservation 
27 programs that give priority to measures with the highest benefit-to-cost ratio, as long 
28 as cost-effective collateral efficiency opportunities are not lost, and that:
29 (1)  Reliably reduce greenhouse gas production and heating energy costs by fossil 
30 fuel combustion in the State at the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit 
31 of emissions; or
32 (2)  Reliably increase the efficiency with which energy in the State is consumed at 
33 the lowest cost in funds from the trust fund per unit of energy saved.

39 efficient products and services;
40 (3)  Promote sustainable economic development and reduce environmental 
41 damage;
Page 2 - 130LR0807(01)1 (4)  Reduce the price of electricity over time for all consumers by achieving 
2 reductions in demand for electricity during peak use periods, including by the 
3 implementation of beneficial electrification; and
4 (5)  Reduce total energy costs for electricity consumers in the State by increasing 
5 the efficiency with which electricity is consumed. ; and
6 (6)  Reduce total energy consumption by electricity consumers in the State through 
7 provision of cost-effective energy efficiency and weatherization measures in 
8 accordance with section 10119, subsection 2, paragraph A, subparagraph (1).
9Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §10110, sub-§2, ¶B, as amended by PL 2015, c. 494, Pt. A,

19 conservation measures for such consumers, including an assessment of the number 
20 of low-income residential consumers that may be eligible for such programs;
21Sec. 7.  35-A MRSA §10119, sub-§2, ¶A, as amended by PL 2019, c. 306, §6, is 
22 further amended by repealing subparagraph (1) and enacting the following in its place:
