Page 1 - 130LR1920(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §2102, sub-§1, as amended by PL 2011, c. 623, Pt. A, §17, is 
3 further amended to read:
41.  Approval required.  Except as provided in subsection 2 and in section 4507, a 
5 public utility may not furnish any of the services set out in section 2101 in or to any 
6 municipality in or to which another public utility is furnishing or is authorized to furnish a 
7 similar service without the approval of the commission.  For a municipal power district 
8 created under chapter 39, commission approval required under this subsection is limited to 
9 a commission determination that the procedures prescribed in chapter 39 for the creation 
10 of a municipal power district have been complied with and that there is no proven net harm 
11 to other ratepayers associated with the loss of customers by the transmission and 
12 distribution utility that will result from the commission's approval of the district under this 
13 subsection.  The commission may condition approval upon the submission of a bond or 
14 other financial security if the commission determines that such a requirement is necessary 
15 to ensure that a public utility has the financial ability to meet its obligations under this Title.
16Sec. 2.  35-A MRSA §3903, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 141, Pt. A, §6, is 
17 amended to read:
184.  Favorable vote.  If a majority of the legal votes cast on this question favor 
19 incorporation, a municipal power district may be created for that municipality under this 
20 chapter upon declaration of the vote by the municipal officers, provided that the total 
21 number of votes cast for and against the incorporation equals or exceeds 40% of the total 
22 votes cast in that municipality for all candidates for Governor at the previous gubernatorial 
23 election.  If not, the proposed district is not created at that time.  Upon certification of a 
24 favorable vote by the municipal officers, the commission shall approve formation of the 
25 district if the commission finds that formation would be in conformance with the 
26 requirements of this Title  chapter.  Upon approval by the commission, the district is created 
27 and the commission shall file certification of that approval with the Secretary of State.
28Sec. 3.  35-A MRSA §3903, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
295.  Transfer of property; payment of just compensation.  When a municipal power 
30 district is created under this section and approved by the commission under this section and 
31 section 2102, the transmission and distribution utility furnishing service in that 
32 municipality must conform to that municipal decision and facilitate the transfer of property. 
33 The municipal power district shall pay the transmission and distribution utility just 
34 compensation, as determined by the commission, for the property of the transmission and 
35 distribution utility.
36Sec. 4.  35-A MRSA §3904, sub-§4, as enacted by PL 1987, c. 141, Pt. A, §6, is 
37 amended to read:
384.  Favorable vote.  If, in each municipality, a majority of the legal votes cast on this 
39 question favor incorporation, a municipal power district may be created for those 
40 municipalities under this chapter upon declaration of the vote of the municipal officers, 
41 provided that the total number of votes cast in each municipality for and against the 
42 incorporation equals or exceeds 40% of the total votes cast in the municipality for all 
43 candidates for Governor at the previous gubernatorial election.  Upon certification of a 
44 favorable vote by the municipal officers, the commission shall approve formation of the 
Page 2 - 130LR1920(01)45 district if the commission finds that formation would be in conformance with the 
46 requirements of this Title  chapter.  Upon approval by the commission, the district is created 
47 and the commission shall file certification of that approval with the Secretary of State.
4Sec. 5.  35-A MRSA §3904, sub-§5 is enacted to read:
55.  Transfer of property; payment of just compensation.  When a municipal power 
6 district is created under this section and approved by the commission under this section and 
7 section 2102, the transmission and distribution utility furnishing service in those 
8 municipalities must conform to those municipal decisions and facilitate the transfer of 
9 property.  The municipal power district shall pay the transmission and distribution utility 
10 just compensation, as determined by the commission, for the property of the transmission 
11 and distribution utility.
12SUMMARY
13 This bill limits the approval by the Public Utilities Commission of a municipal power 
14 district's proposal to furnish service in a municipality or municipalities in which another 
15 utility is already furnishing service to the commission's determination that there is no 
16 proven net harm to other ratepayers associated with the loss of customers by the 
17 transmission and distribution utility and that the municipal power district was created in 
18 conformance with the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, chapter 39, which includes a 
19 favorable municipal vote to create the district.
20 It specifies that the transmission and distribution utility furnishing service in the 
21 municipality or municipalities where a municipal power district is created and approved by 
22 the commission must facilitate the transfer of property and be provided just compensation, 
23 as determined by the commission, for that property.1
