6. Exclusions. Coverage Except as provided in subsection 2, paragraph B for an

to this section shall report to the superintendent on its experience pursuant to this section

The Legislature finds that the requirements of this Act do not constitute an addition to the 
State's essential health benefits that requires defrayal of costs by the State pursuant to 42 
United States Code, Section 18031(d)(3)(B) because the requirements clarify that the law 
requiring a health insurance carrier to provide coverage for prosthetic devices to meet the 
medical needs of an enrollee under 18 years of age includes a prosthetic device designed 
to meet the enrollee's medical needs for recreational purposes. 
Sec. 5. Application. The requirements of this Act apply to all policies, contracts 
and certificates executed, delivered, issued for delivery, continued or renewed in this State 
on or after January 1, 2023. For purposes of this Act, all contracts are deemed to be renewed 
no later than the next yearly anniversary of the contract date.' 
Amend the bill by relettering or renumbering any nonconsecutive Part letter or section 
number to read consecutively. 
SUMMARY 
This amendment replaces the bill. Under current law, health insurance carriers are 
required to provide coverage for a prosthetic device designed to meet an enrollee's medical 
needs. The amendment requires a carrier to provide coverage to enrollees under 18 years 
of age for a prosthetic device designed to meet an enrollee's medical needs for recreational 
purposes. The requirement applies to all health plans issued or renewed on or after January 
1, 2023. The amendment requires carriers to report to the Superintendent of Insurance on 
their claims experience with providing the covered services after 4 years, and the 
superintendent is required to report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature 
having jurisdiction over health coverage and insurance matters. 
The amendment also includes lm1guage stating the Legislature's finding that the 
changes are not an addition to the State's essential health benefits that would require the 
State to defray costs pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
