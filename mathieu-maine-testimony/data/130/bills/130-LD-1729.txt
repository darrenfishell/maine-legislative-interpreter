17SUMMARY
18 This resolve requires the Department of Health and Human Services to convene a 
19 commission consisting of representatives of other government agencies or entities and 
20 interested groups to assess the feasibility of having the University of Maine System and 
21 other appropriate institutions or a public-private partnership between the University of 
22 Maine System, other appropriate institutions and a licensed drug manufacturer produce 
23 insulin in the State and provide such insulin at reduced, low or no cost to low-income 
24 residents of the State.  The resolve requires the commission to assess the feasibility of such 
25 a program by reviewing factors including potential savings and additional costs to the 
26 University of Maine System and the State, the number of individuals who would benefit 
27 from such a program, potential regulatory or legal obstacles, available alternatives to 
28 providing insulin to low-income individuals at low or no cost and to seek input from 
29 members of the Legislature when making its assessment.  The resolve requires the 
30 commission to provide a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human 
31 Services by January 1, 2022 and authorizes the committee to introduce legislation based on 
32 that report during the Second Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.18
