24 to enter into a promissory note or any other financial instrument or obligation that survives 
25 the foreclosure of the purchaser's interest in the real estate, or enforce any such obligation, 
26 unless:
27 A. The term of the promissory note does not exceed the term of the land installment 
28 contract;
29 B. Payments of principal made during the term of the promissory note are credited to 
30 reduce the principal due on the note; and
