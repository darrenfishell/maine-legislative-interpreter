The Education in the Unorganized Territory program within the Department of Education will require ongoing 
General Fund appropriations of $67,882 begimring in fiscal year 2023-24 for the increased health and dental insurance 
plan costs associated with allowing certain unorganized territory school staff to choose to received annualized pay 
effective July 1, 2023. Tlris estimate, provided by the Depa1tment of Education, assumes that 31 unorganized territ01y 
school employees will choose to receive their pay on an annualized basis. Currently, these employees do not receive 
employee benefits year-round. General Fund expenditures from this program are fully reimbursed by the Unorganized 
Territory Education and Services Fund. Therefore, there is no net general fund impact to the State as a result of tlris 
legislation. 
The bill will result in a corresponding increase in the tax collected through the Unorganized Territory Education and 
Services Tax, which is levied on all nonexempt real and personal property located in the Unorganized Territ01y Tax 
District, beginning in fiscal year 2023-24. As stated above, this additional tax revenue will be used to reimburse the 
General Fund for expenditures incurred because of this bill. 
Additional costs to the Education in the Unorganized Territory program associated with programming and other 
administrative costs to implement the requirements of tlris legislation cannot be determined at tlris time, but will als, 
be fully reimbursed by the Unorganized Territory Education and Services Fund.
