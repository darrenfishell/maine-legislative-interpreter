Page 3 - 130LR0727(01)45 require the collector managing the program collection site to pay to the recycler a 
46 fee not to exceed $600 per shipment that is reasonably related to the number of 
47 pounds by which the shipment fails to meet the 18,000-pound threshold; and
4 (5)  Include with each shipment of covered electronic devices prepared for 
5 transportation in accordance with subparagraphs (2) and (3) a bill of lading or 
6 similar manifest describing the origin of the covered electronic devices in the 
7 shipment, the number of pallets or shipping containers included in the shipment 
8 and the covered electronic device categories in each pallet or shipping container.
9 B.  A consolidator is subject to the requirements of this paragraph.
10 (1-A)  A consolidator shall maintain a written log of the total weight of each type 
11 of covered electronic device category delivered each month to the consolidator and 
12 identified as generated by a covered entity in the State.  By March 1st each year, a 
13 consolidator shall provide this accounting to the department.
14 (3)  A consolidator shall work cooperatively with manufacturers to ensure 
15 implementation of a practical and feasible financing system with costs calculated 
16 on a basis proportional to the manufacturer's national market share of each type of 
17 covered electronic device sold in the State multiplied by the total pounds recycled.  
18 At a minimum, a consolidator shall invoice the manufacturers for the handling, 
19 transportation and recycling costs for which they are responsible under the 
20 provisions of this subsection.
21 This subparagraph is repealed January 1, 2023.
22 (3-A)  A manufacturer clearinghouse shall contract with and identify in the plan 
23 submitted to the department pursuant paragraph D, subparagraph (3) each 
24 consolidator that will work cooperatively with manufacturers participating in the 
25 manufacturer clearinghouse to ensure implementation of a practical and feasible 
26 financing system under the statewide manufacturer electronic waste program 
27 implemented by the manufacturer clearinghouse with costs calculated in 
28 accordance with subsection 5-A on a basis proportional to the manufacturer's 
29 national market share of each covered electronic device category sold in the State 
30 multiplied by the total pounds recycled.  At a minimum, a consolidator shall 
31 invoice manufacturers or a manufacturer clearinghouse operating a statewide 
32 manufacturer electronic waste program pursuant to paragraph D for the handling, 
33 transportation and recycling costs for which they are responsible under the 
34 provisions of this subsection.
35 (4)  A consolidator shall transport covered electronic devices to a recycling and 
36 dismantling facility that provides a sworn certification pursuant to paragraph C.  A 
37 consolidator shall maintain for a minimum of 3 years a copy of the sworn 
38 certification from each recycling and dismantling facility that receives covered 
39 electronic devices from the consolidator and shall provide the department with a 
40 copy of these records within 24 hours of request by the department.
41 C.  A recycling and dismantling facility shall provide to a consolidator a sworn 
42 certification that its handling, processing, refurbishment and recycling of covered 
43 electronic devices are certified pursuant to 3rd-party certification standards approved 1
2
3
Page 4 - 130LR0727(01)44 by the department and meet other applicable guidelines for environmentally sound 
45 management published by the department.
3 D.  Covered electronic device manufacturers are subject to the requirements of this 
4 paragraph.
5 (1)  Manufacturers shall pay the reasonable operational costs of the consolidator 
6 attributable to the handling of all covered electronic devices received at 
7 consolidation facilities in this State, the transportation costs from the consolidation 
8 facility to a licensed recycling and dismantling facility and the costs of recycling. 
9 "Reasonable operational costs" includes the costs associated with ensuring that 
10 consolidation facilities are geographically located to conveniently serve all areas 
11 of the State as determined by the department.  The recycling of each type of 
12 covered electronic device must be funded by allocating the cost of the program 
13 electronics recycling system established under this section among the 
14 manufacturers selling covered electronic devices in the State on a basis 
15 proportional to the manufacturer's national market share of the type of covered 
16 electronic device.  The department shall annually determine each manufacturer's 
17 recycling share based on readily available national market share data.  If the 
18 department determines that a manufacturer's market share is less than 1/10 of 1%, 
19 the department may determine that market share de minimus.  A manufacturer 
20 whose market share is determined de minimus by the department is not responsible 
21 for payment of a pro rata share for the corresponding billing year.  The total market 
22 shares determined de minimus by the department must be proportionally allocated 
23 to and paid for by the manufacturers that have 1/10 of 1% or more of the market 
24 of each type of covered electronic device  category.
25 This subparagraph is repealed January 1, 2023.
26 (2)  Each manufacturer shall work cooperatively with consolidators to ensure 
27 implementation of a practical and feasible financing system.  Within 90 days of 
28 receipt of an invoice, a manufacturer shall reimburse a consolidator for allowable 
29 costs incurred by that consolidator.
30 This subparagraph is repealed January 1, 2023.

36 contact for the program;
37 (b)  If submitted by a manufacturer clearinghouse, a list of the manufacturers 
38 that will be participating in the program during the upcoming calendar year 
39 and a certification that those participating manufacturers collectively represent 
40 at least 50% of the total market share responsibility for the recycling of covered 
41 electronic devices for the upcoming calendar year for all manufacturers subject 
42 to this section.  The department may not approve a plan submitted under this 
43 subparagraph by a manufacturer clearinghouse if the department determines 
44 that the manufacturers that will be participating in the program during the 1
2
Page 5 - 130LR0727(01)45 upcoming calendar year collectively represent less than 50% of the total 
46 market share responsibility for the recycling of covered electronic devices for 
47 the upcoming calendar year for all manufacturers subject to this section;
4 (c)  A list of the municipalities that have elected to participate in the program 
5 received in accordance with subsection 5, paragraph A-2 and a description of 
6 the instructions that will be provided under the program to municipalities

26 This paragraph is repealed January 1, 2023.
27Sec. 7.  38 MRSA §1610, sub-§5-A is enacted to read:
285-A.  Allocation of financial responsibility; manufacturer clearinghouse.  In 
29 accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a manufacturer clearinghouse shall 
30 allocate financial responsibility for the costs of implementing and operating an approved 
31 statewide manufacturer electronic waste program as required pursuant to subsection 5, 
32 paragraph D among the manufacturers participating in the program.
33 A. On or before March 1, 2022, and annually thereafter, a manufacturer clearinghouse 
34 shall submit to the department:
35 (1) Using best available data, an estimate of the return share of each category of 
36 covered electronic device associated with its participating manufacturers for the 
37 upcoming calendar year and an estimate of each participating manufacturer's 
38 market share of each category of covered electronic device;
39 (2) A proposed methodology for fairly and reasonably allocating financial 
40 responsibility for program costs during the upcoming calendar year between 
41 participating manufacturers that is designed to ensure that the share of the costs 
42 allocated to each manufacturer is reasonably related to the manufacturer's market 
43 share of covered electronic devices.  Manufacturers must assume financial 1
2
3
Page 7 - 130LR0727(01)44 responsibility for the costs associated with the collection and preparation for 
45 transportation of covered electronic devices by collectors under the program; and
3 (3) In addition to the methodology described in subparagraph (2), at the election of 
4 the manufacturer clearinghouse and after adequate notice to all participating 
5 manufacturers, a proposed methodology for reducing the financial responsibility 
6 of participating manufacturers by encouraging the use of readily recyclable or 
7 sustainable materials in covered electronic devices sold in the State.  The 
8 methodology under this subparagraph may not be designed to result in the 
9 reduction by more than 50% of any participating manufacturer's financial 
10 responsibility.
11 B.  On or before November 1, 2022, and annually thereafter, based on the information 
12 provided pursuant to paragraph A and any other data available to the department, the 
13 department shall submit to a manufacturer clearinghouse a written statement describing 
14 the unadjusted total proportional responsibility for each manufacturer participating in 
15 the manufacturer clearinghouse for the upcoming calendar year, calculated as follows:
16 (1)  For each covered electronic device category, the department shall multiply the 
17 participating manufacturer's market share for the covered electronic device 
18 category by the return share for the covered electronic device category; and
19 (2) The department shall add together all of the amounts calculated pursuant to 
20 subparagraph (1), which shall constitute the participating manufacturer's 
21 unadjusted total proportional responsibility.
22 If the department determines that, for any covered electronic device category, the sum 
23 of the amounts calculated pursuant to subparagraph (1) for all participating 
24 manufacturers with respect to that category of covered electronic device does not equal 
25 the total return share for that category of covered electronic devices described in 
26 paragraph A, subparagraph (1), the department shall calculate the discrepancy between 
27 that sum and the total return share and, for each participating manufacturer, multiply 
28 the resulting figure by the manufacturer's market share for that category of covered 
29 electronic device.  The department shall include these amounts, which constitute each 
30 participating manufacturer's adjusted total proportional responsibility, in the written 
31 notification to the manufacturer clearinghouse required under this paragraph.
32 C.  A manufacturer may through a separate agreement with a collection site that is not 
33 a program collection site satisfy all or a portion of its financial responsibility under the 
34 program associated with the collection, transportation and recycling of covered 
35 electronic devices and allocated in accordance with this subsection.
36 D.  Beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the department shall provide 
37 each manufacturer with a listing of the manufacturer's proportional market share 
38 responsibility for the recycling of covered electronic devices for the subsequent 
39 calendar year and shall provide a manufacturer clearinghouse with a listing of the 
40 proportional market share responsibility for the recycling of covered electronic devices 
41 for the subsequent calendar year for each manufacturer participating in the 
42 manufacturer clearinghouse.
43Sec. 8.  38 MRSA §1610, sub-§7, as amended by PL 2017, c. 391, §4, is repealed 
44 and the following enacted in its place:1
2
Page 8 - 130LR0727(01)17.  Enforcement; cost recovery.  The department must enforce this section in 
2 accordance with the provisions of sections 347-A and 349.
3 A.  If a manufacturer fails to pay for the costs allocated to it pursuant to subsection 5, 
4 paragraph D, subparagraph (1), the department may pay a consolidator its legitimate 
5 costs from the Maine Solid Waste Management Fund established in section 2201 and 
6 seek cost recovery from the nonpaying manufacturer.  Any nonpaying manufacturer is 
7 liable to the State for costs incurred by the State in an amount up to 3 times the amount 
8 incurred as a result of such failure to comply.
9 This paragraph is repealed January 1, 2023.
10 B.  The Attorney General is authorized to commence a civil action against any 
11 manufacturer to recover the costs described in this subsection, which are in addition to 
12 any fines and penalties established pursuant to section 349.  Any money received by 
13 the State pursuant to this subsection must be deposited in the Maine Solid Waste 
14 Management Fund established in section 2201.
15 This paragraph is repealed January 1, 2023.
16 C.  Beginning January 1, 2023, a manufacturer clearinghouse may implement policies 
17 and procedures to exclude from participation any manufacturer that fails to comply 
18 with the requirements of this section but has no authority to enforce any provision of 
19 this section.  If a manufacturer clearinghouse has reason to believe that a manufacturer 
20 has failed to comply with the requirements of this section, it shall notify the department 
21 of the potential noncompliance.
22Sec. 9.  38 MRSA §1610, sub-§10-A is enacted to read:
2310-A.  Antitrust.  A manufacturer or manufacturer clearinghouse, including a 
24 manufacturer's or manufacturer clearinghouse's officers, members, employees and agents 
25 that organize a statewide manufacturer electronic waste program under this section, is 
26 immune from damages, liability or scrutiny under state laws relating to antitrust, restraint 
27 of trade, unfair trade practices and other regulation of trade or commerce for the 
28 manufacturer's or manufacturer clearinghouse's conduct, regardless of the effect of such 
29 conduct on competition, only to the extent necessary to plan and implement the 
30 manufacturer's or manufacturer clearinghouse's statewide manufacturer electronic waste 
31 program consistent with the provisions of this section.  The activities of a manufacturer or 
32 manufacturer clearinghouse that are authorized under this section are undertaken pursuant 
33 to the express purposes stated in subsection 1 and under the active supervision of the 
34 department in accordance with its authority under this section.
35Sec. 10.  38 MRSA §1610, sub-§11, as enacted by PL 2009, c. 397, §12, is amended 
36 to read:
3711.  Interstate clearinghouse for electronic waste  recycling collaboration.  The
