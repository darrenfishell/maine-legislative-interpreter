Page 1 - 130LR0983(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  38 MRSA §488, sub-§19, as amended by PL 2015, c. 28, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
419.  Municipal capacity.  A structure, as defined in section 482, subsection 6, that is 
5 from 3 acres up to and including 7 acres or a subdivision, as defined in section 482, 
6 subsection 5, that is made up of 15 or more lots for single-family, detached, residential 
7 housing, common areas or open space with an aggregate area of from 30 acres up to and 
8 including 100 acres is exempt from review under this article if it is located wholly within 
9 a municipality or municipalities meeting the criteria in paragraphs A to D as determined by 
10 the department and it is located wholly within a designated growth area as identified in a 
11 comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to Title 30‑A, chapter 187, subchapter 2.  The 
12 planning board of the municipality in which the development is located or an adjacent 
13 municipality may petition the commissioner to review such a structure or subdivision if it 
14 has regional environmental impacts.  This petition must be filed within 20 days of the 
15 receipt of the application by the municipality.  State jurisdiction must be exerted, if at all, 
16 within 30 days of receipt of the completed project application by the commissioner from 
17 the municipality or within 30 days of receipt of any modification to that application from 
18 the municipality.  Review by the department is limited to the identified regional 
19 environmental impacts.  The criteria are as follows:
20 A.  A municipal planning board or reviewing authority is established and the 
21 municipality has adequate resources to administer and enforce the provisions of its 
22 ordinances.  In determining whether this criterion is met, the commissioner may 
23 consider any specific and adequate technical assistance that is provided by a regional 
24 council;
25 B.  The municipality has adopted a site plan review ordinance.  In determining the 
26 adequacy of the ordinance, the commissioner may consider model site plan review 
27 ordinances commonly used by municipalities in this State that address the issues 
28 reviewed under applicable provisions of this article prior to July 1, 1997;
29 C.  The municipality has adopted subdivision regulations.  In determining the adequacy 
30 of these regulations, the commissioner may consider model subdivision regulations 
31 commonly used by municipalities in this State; and
32 D.  The former State Planning Office or the Department of Agriculture, Conservation 
33 and Forestry has determined that the municipality has a comprehensive land use plan 
34 and land use ordinances or zoning ordinances that are consistent with Title 30‑A, 
35 chapter 187 in providing for the protection of wildlife habitat, fisheries, unusual natural 
36 areas and archaeological and historic sites.
37 The department, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and 
38 Forestry, shall publish a list of those municipalities determined to have capacity pursuant 
39 to this subsection.  This list need not be established by rule and must be published by 
40 January 1st of each year.  The list must specify whether a municipality has capacity to 
41 review structures or subdivisions of lots for single-family, detached, residential housing, 
42 common areas or open space or both types of development.  The department may recognize 
43 joint arrangements among municipalities and regional organizations in determining 
44 whether the requirements of this subsection are met.   The department may review 
Page 2 - 130LR0983(01)45 municipalities that are determined to have capacity pursuant to this subsection for 
46 compliance with the criteria in paragraphs A to D, and if the department determines that a 
47 municipality does not meet the criteria, the department may modify or remove the 
48 determination of capacity.
5 A modification to a development that was reviewed by a municipality and exempted 
6 pursuant to this subsection or was reviewed by the department prior to a determination that 
7 a municipality has capacity pursuant to this subsection is exempt as long as the modification 
8 will not cause the total area of the development to exceed the maximum acreage specified 
9 in this subsection for that type of development or, based upon information submitted by the 
10 municipality concerning the development and modification, the department determines that 
11 the modification may be adequately reviewed by the municipality.
12Sec. 2.  38 MRSA §489-A, sub-§1, ¶A, as repealed and replaced by PL 1999, c. 
13 790, Pt. A, §51, is amended to read:
14 A.  Subdivisions as described in section 482, subsection 5 of more than 20 acres but 
15 less than 100 acres; or
16Sec. 3.  38 MRSA §489-A, sub-§1, ¶H, as enacted by PL 1999, c. 243, §17, is 
17 amended to read:
18 H.  Structures as described in section 482, subsection 6 in excess of 3 acres but less 
19 than 7 acres.
