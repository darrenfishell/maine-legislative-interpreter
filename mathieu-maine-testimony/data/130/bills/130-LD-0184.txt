Page 1 - 130LR0916(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the boating season begins in the State prior to the statutory adjournment 
4 date; and
5Whereas, this Act is necessary to protect Maine's water bodies from invasive aquatic 
6 plants; and
7Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
8 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
9 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
10 therefore,
11Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
12Sec. 1.  38 MRSA ยง419-C, sub-ยง1-A is enacted to read:
131-A.  Draining of vessels and equipment.  When removing a vessel from an inland 
14 water body and prior to transport away from the area where the vessel left the water, a 
15 person shall:
16 A.  Drain the vessel, trailer and other equipment that holds water, including live wells, 
17 ballast tanks and bilges; and
18 B.  Remove or open drain plugs, bailers, valves and other devices to drain the water 
19 from the live wells, ballast tanks and bilges.
20 For the purposes of this subsection, "vessel" has the same meaning as in section 542, 
21 subsection 11.
22 Nothing in this subsection allows a person to directly or indirectly discharge pollutants into 
23 waters of the State.  This subsection does not apply to emergency response vessels and their 
24 related equipment.
25Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
26 takes effect when approved.
27SUMMARY
28 This bill requires a person when removing a vessel from an inland water body to drain 
29 the vessel and other equipment and to remove or open drain plugs, bailers, valves and other 
30 devices to drain the water before that vessel is transported. It exempts emergency response 
31 vessels from these requirements.
