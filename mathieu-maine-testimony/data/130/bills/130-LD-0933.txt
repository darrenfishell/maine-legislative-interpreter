Page 1 - 130LR1895(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, many residents of rural Maine lack access to affordable, high-speed Internet 
4 service; and
5Whereas, the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, 
6 has revealed and exacerbated the inequalities of the digital divide in Maine;
7Whereas, utility pole attachment rates and utility pole rental rates in unserved areas 
8 in Maine comprise between 25% and 40% of the cost of expanding fiber-optic lines to those 
9 areas; and
10Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
11 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
13 therefore,
14Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
15Sec. 1.  35-A MRSA §711, sub-§4, as amended by PL 2017, c. 199, §1, is further 
16 amended to read:
174.  Rules.  The commission shall adopt rules governing the resolution of pole 
18 attachment disputes and the rates, terms and conditions of joint use. The rules must promote 
19 competition, further the state broadband policy set forth in section 9202‑A and ensure safe, 
20 nondiscriminatory access on just and reasonable terms. The rules must also include a 
21 process for ensuring that a new joint use entity seeking access to the poles, ducts, conduits 
22 or rights-of-way of another joint use entity meets the requirements of subsection 1, 
23 paragraph D. The rules may include establishment of a mechanism or process by which 
24 joint use rates in unserved areas of the State are required to be reduced or capped in a 
25 manner designed to encourage broadband expansion in those unserved areas and joint use 
26 rates in areas of the State that are not unserved areas are required to be increased.  In 
27 establishing rates, the commission shall consider various formulas, including, but not 
28 limited to, the formula adopted by the Federal Communications Commission as codified in 
29 47 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1, Subpart J, as amended.  Rules adopted or amended  
30 pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, chapter 375, 
31 subchapter 2-A.
32Sec. 2.  Public Utilities Commission; study.  The Public Utilities Commission, in 
33 consultation with the ConnectMaine Authority, shall study methods of promoting 
34 broadband expansion in unserved areas of the State through a limited-period reduction in 
35 utility pole attachment rates for broadband providers that agree to deliver new high-speed 
36 Internet service in those unserved areas in conjunction with a limited-period increase in 
37 utility pole attachment rates in areas of the State that are not unserved areas.  The study 
38 must involve, but is not limited to, a review of the so-called "One Buck Deal" financial 
39 incentive program implemented by the Georgia Public Service Commission.  As used in 
40 this section, "unserved areas" means those areas defined by rule by the ConnectMaine 
41 Authority pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 9204-A, subsection 
42 1.
Page 2 - 130LR1895(01)1Sec. 3.  Report.  No later than January 1, 2022, the Public Utilities Commission shall 
2 submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology 
3 describing the findings of the study under section 2 and any recommendations, including 
4 proposed legislation, resulting from that study.  After reviewing the report, the joint 
5 standing committee may report out legislation relating to the report to the Second Regular 
6 Session of the 130th Legislature.
7Emergency clause.  In view of the emergency cited in the preamble, this legislation 
8 takes effect when approved.
9SUMMARY
10 This bill authorizes the Public Utilities Commission to adopt rules establishing a 
11 mechanism or process by which utility pole joint use rates in unserved areas of the State 
12 are required to be reduced or capped in a manner designed to encourage broadband 
13 expansion in those unserved areas and joint use rates in areas of the State that are not 
14 unserved areas are required to be increased.
15 The bill also requires the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with the 
16 ConnectMaine Authority, to study methods of promoting broadband expansion in unserved 
17 areas of the State through a limited-period reduction in utility pole attachment rates for 
18 broadband providers that agree to deliver new high-speed Internet service in those unserved 
19 areas in conjunction with a limited-period increase in utility pole attachment rates in areas 
20 of the State that are not unserved areas.  No later than January 1, 2022, the Public Utilities 
21 Commission is required to submit a report to the Joint Standing Committee on Energy, 
22 Utilities and Technology describing the findings of that study and any recommendations, 
23 including proposed legislation, resulting from that study.  After reviewing the report, the 
24 joint standing committee may report out legislation relating to the report to the Second 
25 Regular Session of the 130th Legislature.10
