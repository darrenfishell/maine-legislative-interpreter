Page 1 - 130LR2204(01)1Emergency preamble.  Whereas, acts and resolves of the Legislature do not 
2 become effective until 90 days after adjournment unless enacted as emergencies; and
3Whereas, the State’s earned income tax credit law needs to be corrected before the 
4 90-day period expires to avoid a delay in the processing of income tax returns for 2021; 
5 and
6Whereas, legislative action is immediately necessary to ensure correct administration 
7 of the State's earned income tax credit; and
8Whereas, in the judgment of the Legislature, these facts create an emergency within 
9 the meaning of the Constitution of Maine and require the following legislation as 
10 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety; now, 
11 therefore,
12Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
13Sec. 1.  36 MRSA §5219-S, sub-§2, as amended by PL 2021, c. 398, Pt. H, §4, is 
14 further amended to read:
152.  Nonresident taxpayer.  A nonresident individual who is an eligible individual is 
16 allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due under this Part in the amount of 25%, or for 
17 taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2022, 20%, of the 
18 federal earned income credit for the same taxable year for a nonresident eligible individual 
19 who does not have a qualifying child and 12% of the federal earned income credit for the 
20 same taxable year for all other nonresident eligible individuals, except that, for taxable 
21 years beginning after December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2022, all nonresident 
22 eligible individuals are allowed a credit in the amount of 20% of the federal earned income 
23 credit for the same taxable year, multiplied by the ratio of the individual's Maine adjusted 
24 gross income, as defined in section 5102, subsection 1‑C, paragraph B, to the individual's 
25 entire federal adjusted gross income, as modified by section 5122.
26Sec. 2.  36 MRSA §5219-S, sub-§3, as amended by PL 2021, c. 398, Pt. H, §5, is 
27 further amended to read:
283.  Part-year resident taxpayer.  An eligible individual who files a return as a part-
29 year resident in accordance with section 5224‑A is allowed a credit against the tax 
30 otherwise due under this Part in the amount of 25%, or for taxable years beginning after 
31 December 31, 2020 and before January 1, 2022, 20%, of the federal earned income credit 
32 for the same taxable year for an eligible part-year individual who does not have a qualifying 
33 child and 12% of the federal earned income credit for the same taxable year for all other 
34 eligible part-year individuals, except that, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 
35 2020 and before January 1, 2022, all eligible part-year individuals are allowed a credit in 
36 the amount of 20% of the federal earned income credit for the same taxable year, multiplied 
37 by a ratio, the numerator of which is the individual's Maine adjusted gross income as 
38 defined in section 5102, subsection 1‑C, paragraph A for that portion of the taxable year 
39 during which the individual was a resident plus the individual's Maine adjusted gross 
40 income as defined in section 5102, subsection 1-C, paragraph B for that portion of the 
41 taxable year during which the individual was a nonresident and the denominator of which 
42 is the individual's entire federal adjusted gross income, as modified by section 5122.

2 takes effect when approved.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill corrects a drafting error in Public Law 2021, chapter 398 in the law governing 
5 the earned income tax credit.  As enacted, the law limits the credit of 20% of the federal 
6 earned income tax credit for tax year 2021 for nonresidents and part-year residents to those 
7 who do not have a qualifying child.  The intent of chapter 398 was to provide the 20% 
8 credit to all residents, nonresidents and part-year residents for tax year 2021, regardless of 
9 whether a resident, nonresident or part-year resident has a qualifying child; this bill 
10 accomplishes that intent.4
