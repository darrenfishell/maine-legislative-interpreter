18 Supreme Court decision in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), for a government official 
19 for the official's alleged act when it was not clear upon committing the act that the act was 
20 a clear violation of an established statutory or constitutional right under the Maine Civil 
21 Rights Act if:

23 officer who allegedly used or threatened to use force or physical violence against the 
24 aggrieved person;
25 2. The law enforcement officer was required to receive either preservice law 
26 enforcement training, basic law enforcement training or in-service law enforcement 
27 training; and
28 3. The law enforcement agency employing the law enforcement officer was subject to 
29 the requirement to have policies concerning the use of physical force.
