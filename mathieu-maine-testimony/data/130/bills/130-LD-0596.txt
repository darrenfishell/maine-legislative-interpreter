4ยง3028-A.  Abandonment of town ways
5 Beginning October 1, 2021, a town way, or portion thereof, may not be declared 
6 discontinued by abandonment unless the municipality or county where the proposed 
7 abandoned town way is situated complies with the requirements of this section.  A 
8 municipality or its officials or a county or its officials are not liable for nonperformance of 
9 a legal duty with respect to a town way declared discontinued by abandonment in 
10 accordance with this section.
111.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise indicates, the 
12 following terms have the following meanings.
13 A.  "Affected property" means real property that abuts the town way to be declared

15 access route.

20 vote to declare a town way discontinued by abandonment if:
21 A.  For a period of 30 or more consecutive years, the town way was not kept passable 
22 for the use of motor vehicles at the expense of the municipality or county. Isolated acts 
23 of maintenance by the municipality or county without other evidence that shows a clear 
24 intent by the municipality or county to consider or use the town way as if it were a 
25 public way as defined in section 1903, subsection 11 does not negate evidence that the 
26 town way was not kept passable for the use of motor vehicles; and
27 B.  The municipal officers or county commissioners vote to declare the town way 
28 discontinued by abandonment at a regularly scheduled meeting of the municipal 
29 officers or county commissioners.  If the municipal officers or county commissioners 
30 vote to declare a town way discontinued by abandonment, they must also vote on 
31 whether a public easement is retained.
32 A municipality or county may not declare a town way discontinued by abandonment if 
33 evidence is presented to the municipal officers or county commissioners at a meeting held 
34 pursuant to paragraph B or a public hearing held pursuant to subsection 4 that the 
35 municipality or county received funds for any portion of the town way that is the subject 
36 of the discontinuance by abandonment for more than 84 months of the period of 30 or more 
37 consecutive years specified in paragraph A.
383.  Notification of discontinuation by abandonment.  The municipal officers or 
39 county commissioners shall give best practicable notice to all affected property owners of 
40 the town way to be declared discontinued by abandonment at least 30 days prior to the 
41 meeting required in subsection 2, paragraph B.
Page 2 - 130LR1115(01)1 A.  The notice must include information regarding the potential retention of a public 
2 easement, and:
3 (1)  The affected property owners' maintenance obligations for and right of access 
4 to the town way, if any;

6 retained; and
7 (3)  Information regarding the rights of affected property owners to enter into 
8 agreements regarding maintenance of and access to that town way, including the 
9 right of affected property owners to create private easements.
10 B.  If the town way to be declared discontinued by abandonment is the only means of 
11 access to property in an adjacent municipality or county, the municipal officers or 
12 county commissioners shall cause a written notice of the meeting required in subsection 
13 2, paragraph B to be given to the municipal officers or county commissioners of the 
14 adjacent municipality or county at least 30 days prior to that meeting.
154.  Public hearing.  The municipal officers or county commissioners shall hold a public

22 interests of the municipality or county in the abandoned town way pass as follows.

24 easement in the abandoned town way, all interests of the municipality or county in the 
25 town way, if any, pass to the abutting property owners to the center of the town way.
26 B.  If the municipal officers or county commissioners vote to retain a public easement 
27 in the abandoned town way, all other interests of the municipality or county in the town 
28 way, if any, pass to the abutting property owners to the center of the town way and the 
29 public easement retained is limited to rights of access by foot or motor vehicle as 
30 defined in Title 29-A, section 101, subsection 42.
31 An easement for public utility facilities necessary to provide or maintain service remains 
32 in a town way declared to be discontinued by abandonment regardless of whether a public 
33 easement is retained by the municipality or county.
346.  Filing in registry of deeds.  If the municipal officers or county commissioners vote 
35 to declare a town way discontinued by abandonment, the municipal clerk or county clerk 
36 shall record an attested certificate of the discontinuance by abandonment in the registry of 
37 deeds in the county where the abandoned town way is situated.
38 A.  The certificate of discontinuance by abandonment may not be filed before the 
39 appeal period in subsection 7 has passed or, if an appeal is filed, before the appeal

2 under the name of the town way, the name of the municipality or county and the names 
3 of the affected property owners. The municipal clerk or county clerk shall provide a 
4 photocopy of the certificate to the Department of Transportation, Bureau of 
5 Maintenance and Operations.
67.  Appeal.  Notwithstanding section 3029, a person affected by a vote to declare a 
7 town way discontinued by abandonment may appeal the decision by filing a written appeal 
8 request within 10 days of the vote as follows:
9 A.  With the municipal clerk for an appeal of a vote by the municipal officers in a 
10 municipality with a board of appeals authorized to hear the appeal;
11 B.  With the county clerk for an appeal of a vote by the municipal officers in a 
12 municipality that does not have a board of appeals authorized to hear the appeal; or
13 C.  With the county clerk for an appeal of a vote by the county commissioners.
14 Within 15 days after receiving a written appeal request filed pursuant to this subsection, 
15 the municipal clerk or county clerk shall schedule a public hearing on the appeal before the 
16 municipal board of appeals or county commissioners and provide written notice of the 
17 hearing date to the municipal officers or county commissioners and the person filing the 
18 appeal request. The public hearing must occur no more than 30 days after the appeal request 
19 is received.
20 A person aggrieved by the decision of the municipal board of appeals or county 
21 commissioners pursuant to this subsection may appeal the decision to the Superior Court 
22 in the county where the town way is situated, pursuant to the Maine Rules of Civil 
23 Procedure, Rule 80B.
248.  Quasi-judicial act.  The determination of the municipal officers regarding the status 
25 of a town way pursuant to this section is a quasi-judicial act under Title 14, section 8104-B, 
26 subsection 2.
279.  Previously abandoned town ways.  This section does not alter the status of a town 
28 way abandoned by a municipality or county under the terms of former section 3028.
2910.  Common law abandonment.  This section does not alter the ability of a town way 
30 to be abandoned under the common law presumption of abandonment.
3111.  Removal of obstructions.  If the municipal officers or county commissioners have 
32 declared a town way discontinued by abandonment and have retained a public easement in 
33 the abandoned town way under this section, the municipality, county commissioners or an 
34 abutter on the way, acting with the written permission of the municipal officers or county 
35 commissioners, may remove any gates, bars or other obstructions in the town way.
36Sec. 3.  Effective date. This Act takes effect October 1, 2021.
37SUMMARY
38 This bill, effective October 1, 2021, repeals the current statute on the abandonment of 
39 town ways and enacts a new abandonment process in statute that a municipality may choose 
40 to follow to declare a town way abandoned.  This process includes notice provisions to 
41 abutting property owners, property owners for whom the town way is the only means of 
42 access and adjacent municipalities and counties and provides for a public hearing process 
Page 4 - 130LR1115(01)43 and an appeals process.  The bill clarifies that the public easement retained in a town way 
44 discontinued by abandonment is limited to rights of access by foot or motor vehicle, which 
45 are the limits of public easements laid out by a municipality through its eminent domain 
46 powers in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 23, section 3022.
