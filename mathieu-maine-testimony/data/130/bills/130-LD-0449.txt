Page 1 - 130LR1003(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §965, sub-§1, ¶B, as amended by PL 2009, c. 107, §5, is further 
3 amended to read:
4 B.  To meet within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the other party 
5 requesting a meeting for collective bargaining purposes, as long as the parties have not 
6 otherwise agreed in a prior written contract.  This obligation is suspended during the 
7 period between a referendum approving a new regional school unit and the operational 
8 date of the regional school unit, as long as the parties meet at reasonable times during 
9 that period;
10SUMMARY
11 Current law provides that the obligation of a public employer and a bargaining agent 
12 to bargain collectively includes their mutual obligation to meet within 10 days after receipt 
13 of written notice from the other party requesting a meeting for collective bargaining 
14 purposes, as long as the parties have not otherwise agreed in a prior written contract.  This 
15 bill removes the exception for the case in which the parties have otherwise agreed in a prior 
16 written contract.
