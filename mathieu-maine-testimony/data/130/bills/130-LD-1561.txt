9 are met, including, but not limited to, that the plaintiff has produced evidence that is 
10 admissible pursuant to the evidentiary standard set forth in section 11019, subsection 4 and 
11 the Maine Rules of Evidence.
125.  Default judgment.  If the defendant has failed to plead or otherwise defend, the 
13 plaintiff may apply for entry of default and a default judgment. The court is responsible for 
14 entering a default and a default judgment, not the clerk of the court. Regardless of whether 
15 the defendant appears in the action or the judgment is based on a proposed order concerning 
16 a settlement, the court may not enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff unless the court 
17 determines that all the requirements of this section and all other applicable requirements of 
18 this chapter are met, including, but not limited to, that the plaintiff has produced evidence 
19 admissible pursuant to the evidentiary standard set forth in section 11019, subsection 4 and 
20 the Maine Rules of Evidence on all required elements of the plaintiff's claim.
