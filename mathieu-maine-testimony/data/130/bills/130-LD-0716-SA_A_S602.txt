The amendment eliminates the portions of the bill related to the Aging Disability Mortality Review Panel. This 
eliminates the General Fund appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services of $28,464 in fiscal 
year 2021-22 and $29,633 in fiscal year 2022-23 for one Public Health Nurse Consultant position to oversee a 
mortality review committee for all home and community based services waiver programs. Related Federal 
Expenditures Fund allocations for the FMAP match are also removed. 
Additionally, the bill delays the implementation date which eliminates the General Fund deappropriations to the 
Department of Health and Human Services of $137,682 in fiscal year 2021-22 from the Developmental Services 
Oversight and Advisory Board Contract within the Department of Health and Human Services and the corresponding 
appropriations to the Department of Administrative and Financial Services of the same amount in fiscal year 2021-
22.
