Fiscal Note 
Potential increase in property tax payments to municipalities 
Fiscal Detail and Notes 
Under the committee amendment, the Pine Tree Power Company (PTPC) is exempt from paying property taxes, but 
required to make payments in lieu of taxes. This amendment removes the status of the PTPC as a public municipal 
corporation exempt from property tax provisions and must now pay property taxes, but is no longer required to make 
payments in lieu of taxes. As payments in lieu of taxes are typically less than "normal" property tax, this may mean 
some increase in revenue to the municipality or municipalities the PTPC will have a presence in. The PTPC will 
continue to be exempt from state income tax under this amendment.
