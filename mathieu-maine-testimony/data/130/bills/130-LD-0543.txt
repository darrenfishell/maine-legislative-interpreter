2Sec. 1.  26 MRSA §664, sub-§1, as amended by IB 2015, c. 2, §1, is further 
3 amended to read:
41.  Minimum wage.  The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour.  Starting January 
5 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the 
6 minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly 
7 wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00 
8 per hour.  On Starting January 1, 2021 and each January 1st every 3 years thereafter, on 
9 January 1st the minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if 
10 any, in the cost of living. The increase in the cost of living must be measured by the total 
11 percentage increase, if any, as of August of the previous year over the level as of August 
12 of the year preceding that year January 4 years prior to the date of increase to January of 
13 the year prior to the date of increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners 
14 and Clerical Workers, CPI-W, for the Northeast Region, or its successor index, as published 
15 by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics or its successor 
16 agency, with the amount of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of 
17 5¢.   If the highest federal minimum wage is increased in excess of the minimum wage in 
18 effect under this section, the minimum wage under this section is increased to the same 
19 amount, effective on the same date as the increase in the federal minimum wage, and must 
20 be increased in accordance with this section thereafter.
21SUMMARY
22 This bill changes the annual cost-of-living increase in the minimum hourly wage from 
23 annual to triennial.  Current law provides that the minimum hourly wage is adjusted for the 
24 cost of living annually.22
