This amendment replaces the Govemor's Office of Policy Innovation and the Future (GOPIF) with the Department of 
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) as the lead agency to implement a strategic plan to end hunger in the 
State. This change reduces the staffing needs of GOPIF from 4 positions to one position. The amended bill includes an 
ongoing General Fund appropriation of $130,885 beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 for one Public Service Coordinator 
II position and related costs. Any additional costs to ACF as a result of this change are anticipated to be minor and can 
be absorbed within existing budgeted resources.
