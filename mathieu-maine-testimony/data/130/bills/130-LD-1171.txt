Page 1 - 130LR0237(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  15 MRSA ยง57 is enacted to read:
3ยง57.  Requirement to provide notice prior to execution of search warrant
41.  Law enforcement officer defined.  As used in this section, "law enforcement 
5 officer" has the same meaning as in Title 25, section 2801-A, subsection 5.
62.  Prohibition against so-called no-knock warrants.  Notwithstanding any provision 
7 of law to the contrary, a state, county or local law enforcement officer may not execute a 
8 warrant by forcibly entering the location that is the subject of the warrant until after that 
9 law enforcement officer provides notice of the authority to execute the warrant and the 
10 purpose for which the warrant was issued.
113.  Exception.  This section does not apply if the authority issuing the warrant clearly 
12 states that providing notice prior to execution of the warrant would create an imminent risk 
13 of death or bodily harm to a law enforcement officer or an individual in the location that is 
14 the subject of the warrant.
154.  Penalty.  A law enforcement officer who violates this section commits a Class E 
16 crime.
17SUMMARY
18 This bill requires a law enforcement officer, prior to forcibly entering a location that is 
19 the subject of a search warrant, to announce the law enforcement officer's authority to 
20 execute the warrant and the purpose for which the warrant was issued.  This requirement 
21 does not apply if the authority issuing the warrant clearly states that providing such notice 
22 would create an imminent risk of death or bodily harm to a law enforcement officer or an 
23 individual in the location that is the subject of the warrant.
