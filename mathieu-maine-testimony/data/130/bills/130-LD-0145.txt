16SUMMARY
17 This bill contains recommendations of the Probate and Trust Law Advisory 
18 Commission pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 18-C, section 1-803, subsection 
19 2.
20 1.  This bill amends Title 18-C, section 3-108 to resolve an ambiguity as to whether the 
21 provision applies to decedents who died prior to the effective date of Title 18-C.  
22 Section 3-108, subsection 1, paragraph D allows the probate of a will of a decedent 
23 more than 3 years after death in a formal proceeding, but as a result of the limitations 
24 imposed by section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph A, the probate is permitted only for a 
25 decedent who died after the September 1, 2019 effective date of Title 18-C.  Section 3-108, 
26 subsection 1, paragraph D appears to allow an appointment of a personal representative, in 
27 an informal or formal proceeding, more than 3 years after death regardless of whether the 
28 date of death was before, on, or after the September 1, 2019 effective date of Title 18-C.
29 As a result, if a decedent died more than 3 years prior to the September 1, 2019 effective 
30 date, with a purported will, it would not be possible to probate the will under current law 
31 because of the limitation imposed by section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph A.  However, 
32 it appears that the decedent's heirs could, under section 3-108, subsection 1, paragraph D, 
33 still obtain an informal or formal appointment of a personal representative because the 
34 appointment is permitted regardless of the date of death.  The heirs would submit an 
35 informal application or a formal petition for appointment of a personal representative, 
36 indicate that they are aware of an unrevoked testamentary instrument and explain that it is 
37 not being probated because it cannot be probated due to section 8-301, subsection 2, 
38 paragraph A.  There is ambiguity, however, as to whether the limitations of section 8-301, 
39 subsection 2, paragraph A prevent the appointment of a personal representative more than 
40 3 years after the date of death.
41 The interplay between section 3-108, subsection 1, paragraph D and section 8-301, 
42 subsection 2, paragraph A appears to create unintended inconsistencies in outcomes 
43 regarding the appointment of a personal representative and the probate of a will that can be 
Page 3 - 130LR0429(01)44 cured by making it clear that section 3-108, subsection 1, paragraph D applies regardless 
45 of the date of the decedent's death. 
3 2.  This bill amends section 5-308, subsection 4 and section 5-409, subsection 4 to 
4 delay the effective date of the confidentiality of records provisions governing guardianships 
5 of adults and governing conservatorships.  When Title 18-C was enacted, with a September 
6 1, 2019 effective date, the provisions of section 5-308 and section 5-409 had a delayed 
7 effective date of January 1, 2021.  The purpose of the delayed effective date was to give 
8 the Supreme Judicial Court time to address confidentiality of court records in the state 
9 courts and perhaps in the Probate Courts, and then give the commission an opportunity to 
10 propose amendments to sections 5-308 and 5-409 to ensure consistency with confidentiality 
11 of records provisions adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court.  With an effective date of 
12 August 21, 2020, the Supreme Judicial Court adopted the Maine Rules of Electronic Court 
13 Systems, which contains extensive provisions governing the confidentiality of records filed 
14 with the Supreme Judicial Court, the Superior Court and the District Court.  The Supreme 
15 Judicial Court has not yet had an opportunity to consider rules governing confidentiality of 
16 records filed with the Probate Courts.  This bill further delays the effective date of sections 
17 5-308 and 5-409 to January 1, 2023 to provide additional time for the Supreme Judicial 
18 Court, in conjunction with the commission and the Advisory Committee on Probate Rules, 
19 to complete its review and approval of rules governing confidentiality of records in the 
20 Probate Courts.  Because this bill will not take effect before January 1, 2021, these changes 
21 are made retroactive to January 1, 2021.
22 3.  This bill amends section 5-423, subsection 2, paragraph E to remove the mandatory 
23 credit report for the individual subject to conservatorship from the conservator's annual 
24 report and accounting and make the credit report a requirement only if ordered by the court.  
25 The reason for the amendment is because it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the 
26 conservator to obtain a credit report for the individual subject to conservatorship and the 
27 credit report requirement is interfering with the timely submission of conservators' annual 
28 reports and accountings.  The statutory requirement of submission of copies of recent 
29 financial statements along with the detailed accounting schedules provide sufficient court 
30 monitoring of conservators for most situations and the Probate Court will have flexibility 
31 to order a credit report if the court deems the credit report an appropriate element of the 
32 conservator's report and accounting.
33 4.  This bill amends section 5-431, subsection 8 to clarify that the subsection applies to 
34 both the termination and modification of a conservatorship.  The headnote for section 5-431 
35 is "Termination or modification of conservatorship," but subsection 8 refers only to the 
36 termination of a conservatorship, with no reference to modification.  Section 5-319, 
37 subsection 6, which is the counterpart provision that applies to adult guardianships, 
38 includes both terminations and modifications of adult guardianships.  The uniform act, on 
39 which section 5-431, subsection 8 is based, mentions only termination and not 
40 modification; however, the uniform comment to the corresponding paragraph of the 
41 uniform act describes both terminating and modifying conservatorships.  It appears that 
42 reference to modification of a conservatorship was inadvertently omitted from section 
43 5-431, subsection 8 and that the drafting error originated in the uniform act.  To correct the 
44 apparent inadvertent omission, this bill amends subsection 8 to cover modifications of adult 
45 guardianships as well as terminations. 1

Page 4 - 130LR0429(01)1 5.  This bill amends section 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph A-1 to add a reference to 
2 the wrongful death provisions of section 2-807 of Title 18-C to avoid ambiguity as to 
3 whether the intestacy provisions of former Title 18-A or the intestacy provisions of Title 
4 18-C govern the distribution of a recovery of a wrongful death claim.  The first 2 sentences 
5 of section 2-807, subsection 2 require the distribution of a recovery of a wrongful death 
6 claim to be paid to the decedent's heirs without becoming part of the decedent's probate 
7 estate.
8 The intestate succession provisions of Title 18-C are materially different, in a number 
9 of respects, from the intestate succession provisions of former Title 18-A.  Although section 
10 8-301, subsection 2, paragraph A-1 already states that the intestate succession provisions 
11 of Article 2, Part 1, Subpart 1 apply to the estates of decedents who die on or after the 
12 effective date, there remains ambiguity as to whether actions for wrongful death brought 
13 after the effective date, for deaths occurring before the effective date, are governed by the 
14 provisions of former Title 18-A or by the provisions of Title 18-C.  The amendment 
15 resolves any ambiguity by making it clear that the date of death of the decedent will control 
16 which provisions apply.
