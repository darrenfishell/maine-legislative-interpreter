12 'Sec. 2. Solar energy resources interconnection evaluation. The Public 
13 Utilities Commission shall contract with an expert to evaluate near-term refonns to the 
14 State's standards, practices and procedures related to the interconnection of renewable 
15 capacity resources as defined in the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 35-A, section 3210-C, 
16 subsection 1, paragraph E using solar power to investor-owned transmission and 
17 distribution utilities to: 
18 1. Ensure that the timelines and requirements for interconnection do not unduly limit 
19 the ability of residential and nonresidential customers to install on-site solar energy 
20 generation and battery storage systems to offset a customer's electrical consumption and 
21 that interconnection costs for these customers are limited to interconnection facility 
22 upgrades and do not include the cost of distribution upgrades; 
23 2. Improve the transparency of interconnection screens and upgrades for customer-
24 sited generation; and 
25 3. Ensure that dispute resolution processes for residential and nonresidential 
26 interconnection customers are fair and efficient and do not place a disproportionate burden 
27 of technical expertise and cost on these customers. 
28 Within 6 months of the effective date of this Act, the commission shall conduct a 
29 proceeding and issue an order relating to the near-term reforms identified in the evaluation 
30 conducted under this section. Within one year of the effective date of this Act, the 
31 commission shall determine and adopt cost allocation methods for interconnection studies 
32 and upgrades that ensure on-site solar energy generators do not bear prohibitive costs for 
33 their projects to be studied by investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities and to 
34 be interconnected to the State's distribution system.

This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to contract with an outside entity to evaluate near-tenn 
reforms to the State's interconnection standards, practices and procedures related to renewable capacity resources 
using solar power. The bill includes a one-time allocation of $254,693 for contracted services. The PUC is funded by 
an assessment set to produce sufficient revenue for the expenditures allocated by the Legislature for operating the 
PUC. The increased allocations in this bill require a corresponding increase in revenue from the assessment on 
electric transmission and distribution utilities.
