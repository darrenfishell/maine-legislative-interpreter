Page 7 - 130LR2347(01)11. Hearing required.  The corporation may issue bonds to finance its activities only 
2 after giving notice of the proposed issuance and its terms at least twice in a newspaper of 
3 general circulation in the appropriate primary impact community and holding a duly 
4 advertised public hearing on the issuance.
52.  Authority.  The corporation may issue bonds from time to time in its discretion to 
6 finance the undertaking of an authorized activity under this chapter, including, but not 
7 limited to, the payment of principal and interest upon advances for surveys and plans, and 
8 may issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of bonds previously issued.
9 A.  The principal and interest of bonds must be made payable solely from the income, 
10 proceeds, revenues and funds of the corporation derived from or held for activities 
11 under this chapter.  Payment of the principal and interest of bonds may be further 
12 secured by a pledge of a loan, grant or contribution from the Federal Government or 
13 other source in aid of activities of the corporation under this chapter and by a mortgage 
14 of an urban activity or a project or part of a project, title to which is in the corporation.  
15 B.  Bonds issued under this section do not constitute an indebtedness within the 
16 meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction and are not 
17 subject to other laws or charters relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of bonds.  
18 Bonds issued under this chapter are declared to be issued for an essential public and 
19 governmental purpose and, together with interest on and income from the bonds, are 
20 exempt from all taxes. 
21 C.  Bonds may not be issued by the corporation until the corporation has received a 
22 certificate of approval from the Finance Authority of Maine authorizing issuance of the 
23 bonds.  Before issuing a certificate of approval under this section, the Finance 
24 Authority of Maine must determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
25 income, proceeds, revenues and funds of the corporation derived from or held for 
26 activities under this chapter or otherwise pledged to payment of the bonds will be 
27 sufficient to pay the principal, the interest and all other amounts that may at any time 
28 become due and payable under the bonds.  In making this determination, the Finance 
29 Authority of Maine shall consider the corporation's analysis of the proposed bond issue 
30 and the revenues to make payments on the bonds and may require such information, 
31 projections, studies and independent analyses as it considers necessary or desirable and 
32 may charge the corporation reasonable fees and expenses.  The issuance by the Finance 
33 Authority of Maine of a certificate of approval under this section does not constitute 
34 an endorsement of the bonds or the projects or purposes for which those bonds are 
35 issued, and the corporation or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, 
36 any holder of bonds of the corporation, has no cause of action against the Finance 
37 Authority of Maine with respect to any certificate of approval.  The Finance Authority 
38 of Maine may require that it be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the 
39 corporation for any liability or cause of action arising with respect to the bonds. 
403.  General characteristics.  Bonds authorized under this section may be issued in one 
41 or more series.  The resolution, trust indenture or mortgage under which the bonds are 
42 issued may include the following:
43 A.  The date or dates borne by the bonds; 
44 B.  Whether the bonds are payable upon demand or mature at a certain time or times;

114.  Price sold. The bonds may be:
12 A.  Exchanged for other bonds on the basis of par;
13 B.  Sold to the Federal Government at private sale at not less than par.  If less than all 
14 of the authorized principal amount of the bonds is sold to the Federal Government, the 
15 balance may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the 
16 corporation that does not exceed the interest cost to the corporation of the portion of 
17 the bonds sold to the Federal Government; or
18 C.  Sold to a person on such terms as the corporation may negotiate.
195.  Signatures of outgoing officers; negotiability.  If an official of the corporation 
20 whose signature appears on a bond or coupon issued under this chapter ceases to be an 
21 official before the bond is delivered, the signature is nevertheless valid for all purposes as 
22 if the official had remained in office until the delivery.  Notwithstanding contrary 
23 provisions of law, bonds issued under this chapter are fully negotiable.
246.  Bond recitation; conclusive presumptions.  In actions or proceedings involving 
25 the validity or enforceability of a bond issued under this chapter or the security for that 
26 bond, a bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the corporation in connection 
27 with an activity is conclusively deemed to have been issued for that purpose and the activity 
28 is conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with 
29 this chapter.
307.  No personal liability; not debt of State.  A member of the board of directors and 
31 the person executing the bonds are not liable personally on the bonds by reason of the 
32 issuance of the bonds.  The bonds and other obligations of the corporation must have stated 
33 on their face that they are not a debt of the State and that the State is not liable on the bonds.  
34 The bonds or obligations may not be payable out of funds or properties other than those of 
35 the corporation acquired for the purposes of this chapter.
368.  Bonds as legal investments.  Public officers, municipal corporations, political 
37 subdivisions and public bodies; banks, trust companies, bankers, savings banks and 
38 institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment 
39 companies and other persons carrying on a banking business; insurance companies, 
40 insurance associations and other persons carrying on an insurance business; and executors, 
41 administrators, curators, trustees and other fiduciaries may legally invest sinking funds, 
Page 9 - 130LR2347(01)42 money or other funds belonging to them or within their control in bonds or other obligations 
43 issued by the corporation under this chapter.  These bonds or other obligations are 
44 authorized security for all public deposits.  It is the purpose of this section to authorize 
45 persons, political subdivisions and officers, public or private, to use funds owned or 
46 controlled by them for the purchase of these bonds or other obligations.  This section does 
47 not relieve a person of any duty or of exercising reasonable care in selecting securities.
79.  Investment of funds; redemption of bonds.  The corporation may:
8 A.  Invest, in property or securities in which savings banks may legally invest funds 
9 subject to their control, funds held in reserves, sinking funds or funds not required for 
10 immediate disbursement; and 
11 B.  Cancel its bonds by redeeming them at the redemption price established in the bonds 
12 or by purchasing them at less than redemption price.
13ยง13208.  Interest of public officials, directors or employees
141.  Acquisition of interest.  A public official, member of the board of directors or 
15 employee of the corporation may not acquire or hold a direct or an indirect financial or

17 A.  A corporation activity;
18 B.  Corporation property; or 
19 C.  A contract or proposed contract in connection with a corporation activity.

21 directors or employee of the corporation presently owns or controls, or owned or controlled 
22 within the preceding 2 years, a direct or an indirect interest in property known to be 
23 included or planned to be included in a corporation activity, that public official, trustee or 
24 employee shall disclose this fact immediately in writing to the board of directors and the 
25 disclosure must be entered in the board's minutes.
263.  Recusal.  A public official, member of the board of directors or employee of the 
27 corporation with an interest in property under this section may not participate in an action

34 property, and a judgment against the corporation may not be a charge or lien upon its real 
35 and personal property.
