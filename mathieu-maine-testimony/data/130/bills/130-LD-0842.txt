3SUBCHAPTER 6
4POSITIVE REENTRY PAROLE FOR CERTAIN MAINE CRIMINAL CODE 
5PRISONERS
6§5821.  Applicability
7 This subchapter applies to persons sentenced to the custody of the Department of 
8 Corrections.
9§5822.  Parole by board
10 The board may grant a parole from a correctional facility after the expiration of the 
11 term of imprisonment, less deductions pursuant to Title 17-A, section 2307, subsections 2 
12 and 3, or after the parolee's compliance with conditions provided in this subchapter 
13 applicable to the sentence being served.  The board may revoke a parole when a condition 
14 of the parole is violated.
151.  Duration and conditions of parole.  When the board grants a parole, upon release 
16 the parolee shall serve the unexpired portion of the parolee's sentence under conditions of 
17 custody established pursuant to subsection 2, less deductions pursuant to Title 17-A, 
18 section 2307, subsections 2 and 3, unless otherwise indicated by the board.
192.  Custody and control.  While on parole, the parolee is under the custody of the 
20 warden or chief administrative officer of the correctional facility from which the parolee 
21 was released but under the immediate supervision of and subject to the rules of the division 
22 of probation and parole within the department and any special conditions of parole imposed 
23 by the board.
24§5823.  Parole of prisoners; eligibility; process
251.  General provisions regarding eligibility.  A person convicted of one or more 
26 crimes who is sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections and who received 
27 a sentence of imprisonment is eligible for parole upon application if:
28 A.  The person's sentence was imprisonment for life or for any term of not less than 25 
29 years and the person has served at least 20 years of that sentence, or the person's 
30 sentence was imprisonment for a term of at least one year to 25 years and the person 
31 served not less than 1/2 of the sentence of imprisonment or 1/2 of the most recent 
32 sentence imposed by the court, whichever is greater;
33 B.  Based on all available information, including reports that the board may require, 
34 the board determines that there is a reasonable probability that the person will live and 
35 remain at liberty without violating the law; and
36 C.  The board determines that the parole is not incompatible with the welfare of society.
372.  Administrative release and revocation guidelines.  The board shall by rule 
38 develop administrative release guidelines for use by the board in evaluating applications 
39 for parole as described in section 5824 and shall develop administrative revocation 
40 guidelines as described in section 5825 for use by the board in considering revocation of 
41 parole.
Page 2 - 130LR0195(01)13.  Parole hearing.  The board shall hold a hearing, which must be video recorded, to 
2 review an application for parole.  The board shall use its administrative release guidelines 
3 and any other information it determines relevant in its review.  A person seeking parole 
4 must be represented by legal counsel.  The board may hear testimony from both the person 
5 seeking parole and any victims, and the board may hear their testimony separately.
64.  Parole granted.  If after a hearing under subsection 3 the board grants parole, the 
7 board shall impose any conditions it determines appropriate to mitigate the risk of the 
8 person's again violating the law.
95.  Parole denied.  If after a hearing under subsection 3 the board denies parole, a 
10 subsequent review date must be set for 2 years from the date of the denial.  The board shall 
11 inform the person of the reasons parole was denied and what the person needs to 
12 accomplish to be considered again for release on parole.  A person denied parole may 
13 appeal the denial within 90 days.
146.  Rules.  The board shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subchapter.  
15 Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection are routine technical rules as defined in Title 5, 
16 chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
17§5824.  Administrative release guidelines
18 The board shall develop administrative release guidelines using evidence-based risk 
19 assessment criteria for use by the board in evaluating applications for parole.  The 
20 administrative release guidelines must be used to provide the board with consistent and 
21 comprehensive information relevant to risk factors for parolees.  The guidelines must 
22 include a matrix of advisory release decision recommendations for different risk levels.  
23 The following provisions govern administrative release guidelines.
241.  Factors.  In developing the administrative release guidelines, the board shall 
25 consider factors including, but not limited to:
26 A.  The actuarial risk of reoffense.  This factor is the central factor for the board in 
27 making its decision related to the timing and conditions of release on parole.  Risk must 
28 be assessed using evidence-based actuarial risk assessment tools and professional 
29 judgment;
30 B.  Testimony or a written statement of the victim of the crime or a relative of the 
31 victim or a designee of the victim or relative of the victim;
32 C.  The person's assessed criminogenic need level;
33 D.  The person's program and treatment participation and progress while in custody;
34 E.  The person's conduct in the correctional facility;
35 F.  The adequacy of the person's parole plan;
36 G.  Whether the person while serving the person's sentence has threatened or harassed 
37 the victim or the victim's family or has caused the victim or the victim's family to be 
38 threatened or harassed;
39 H.  Aggravating or mitigating factors from the person's criminal case;
40 I.  The testimony or written statement of a prospective parole sponsor, employer or 
41 other person who is available to assist the person if the person is released on parole;
Page 3 - 130LR0195(01)1 J.  Whether the person has previously absconded or escaped or attempted to abscond 
2 or escape while on conditional release, including community supervision;
3 K.  Whether the person completed or worked toward completing a high school diploma, 
4 a general equivalency degree or a college degree during the period of incarceration; 
5 and
6 L.  Any factor that the board determines appropriate or necessary.
7 The board may not use the administrative release guidelines for the consideration of parole 
8 for a person who is serving a sentence for committing a crime under Title 17-A, chapter 11 
9 or 12.  The board shall develop specific sex offender administrative release guidelines to 
10 be used to evaluate parole applications for these cases.
112.  Structured decision making.  The board shall adopt standards for evaluating 
12 outcomes of its parole decisions and shall conduct its business in a manner that is accessible 
13 to victims, offenders, other criminal justice professionals and the community.
143.  Coordination of risk and needs.  The board shall coordinate supervision conditions 
15 and services with assessed risk and need levels as determined in subsection 1.
164.  Risk assessment scale.  The board shall develop a risk assessment scale that 
17 includes evidence-based criteria for reducing the risk of recidivism.  The board shall 
18 validate the risk assessment scale at least every 5 years or more frequently if the predictive 
19 accuracy, as determined by data collection and analysis by the board, falls below an 
20 acceptable level.
215.  Forms.  The board shall develop forms consistent with an effort to record 
22 information required under this section to capture the rationale for the board's decision in 
23 a parole application case.  The department shall print the forms.  Victim identity and input 
24 must be protected from display on the form and any board hearing report that may become 
25 part of an applicant's or parolee's record.
266.  Training.  The board shall seek regular training for its members to ensure that it is 
27 using best practices in parole application evaluation and applying them effectively in 
28 carrying out its duties.
29§5825.  Administrative revocation guidelines
30 The board shall develop administrative revocation guidelines that must be used to 
31 evaluate complaints filed for parole revocation.  The board shall develop administrative 
32 revocation guidelines using evidence-based risk assessment criteria.  The following 
33 provisions govern administrative revocation guidelines.
341.  Factors.  In developing administrative revocation guidelines, the board shall 
35 consider factors including, but not limited to:
36 A.  A determination by the board that a parolee committed a new crime while on parole;
37 B.  The parolee's actuarial risk of reoffense;
38 C.  The seriousness of a violation of a condition of parole, if applicable;
39 D.  The parolee's frequency of violations of conditions of parole;
40 E.  The parolee's efforts to comply with a previous corrective action plan or other 
41 remediation plan required by the board or by the probation and parole officer;
Page 4 - 130LR0195(01)1 F.  The imposition of intermediate sanctions by the probation and parole officer in 
2 response to violations of conditions of parole that may form the basis of the complaint 
3 filed for parole revocation; and
4 G.  Whether modification of parole conditions is consistent with public safety and more 
5 appropriate than revocation of parole.
62.  Revocation determination for violations of conditions of parole.  In evaluating 
7 complaints filed for parole revocation, the board may not revoke parole for violations of 
8 conditions of parole unless the board determines on the record that appropriate intermediate 
9 sanctions have been used and have been ineffective or that the modification of conditions 
10 of parole or the imposition of intermediate sanctions is not appropriate or consistent with 
11 public safety and the welfare of society.
12§5826.  Violations of a condition of parole
131.  Arrest and detention for violation.  A probation and parole officer may arrest and 
14 charge a parolee with violation of a condition of parole, take the parolee into custody and 
15 detain the parolee, pending the issuance of a parole violation warrant.  The detention may 
16 not extend beyond the next business day, and, if a warrant is not issued in that time, the 
17 parolee must be released from arrest and detention.  A parolee arrested and detained does 
18 not have a right of action against the probation and parole officer or any other person 
19 because of that arrest and detention.
202.  Issuance of warrant for a violation; board action.  When a parolee violates a 
21 condition of parole or violates the law, a warrant may be issued for the parolee's arrest.  A 
22 probation and parole officer, or any other law enforcement officer within the State 
23 authorized to make arrests, may arrest the parolee on the warrant and return the parolee to 
24 the correctional facility from which the parolee was paroled.  At its next meeting at that 
25 correctional facility, the board shall hold a hearing.  The parolee is entitled to appear and 
26 be heard.  If the board, after hearing, finds that the parolee has violated a condition of parole 
27 or the law, the board may revoke the parole, set the amount of the unexpired portion of the 
28 sentence the parolee must serve before the parolee is again eligible for a parole hearing 
29 before the board and remand the parolee to the correctional facility from which the parolee 
30 was paroled.
313.  Forfeiting deductions.  Upon revocation of a person's parole by the board under 
32 subsection 2, the person forfeits any deductions pursuant to Title 17-A, section 2307, 
33 subsections 2 and 3 earned while on parole.
344.  Earning deductions.  While a person is serving the unexpired portion of a sentence 
35 after parole has been revoked under subsection 2, the person may earn deductions pursuant 
36 to Title 17-A, section 2307, subsections 2 and 3.
375.  Tolling of sentence.  Whenever a warrant is issued under this section for the arrest 
38 of a parolee, the running of the parolee's sentence is tolled and remains tolled until the 
39 parolee is returned to the correctional facility from which the parolee was paroled.  Tolling 
40 of the running of the sentence must include any time served prior to such return, after 
41 conviction for a crime committed while on parole.
42 In the event of the withdrawal of the warrant, or in the event that the board at the hearing 
43 on the alleged violation finds that the parolee did not violate the conditions of parole or the 
Page 5 - 130LR0195(01)44 law, the parolee must be credited with the time lost by the tolling of the running of the 
45 parolee's sentence.
3§5827.  Sentence for violation of law by parolee
4 A parolee who violates the law while on parole, when the violation is punishable by 
5 imprisonment for one year or more, and who is sentenced to the custody of the department 
6 shall serve the 2nd sentence beginning on the date of termination of the first sentence, 
7 unless the first sentence is otherwise terminated by the board.
8§5828.  Discharge from parole
9 A parolee who faithfully satisfies all the conditions of parole and completes the 
10 parolee's sentence is entitled to a certificate of discharge to be issued by the warden or chief 
11 administrative officer of the correctional facility to which the parolee was committed.  If it 
12 appears to the board that a parolee is no longer in need of supervision, the board may order 
13 the chief administrative officer or warden of the correctional facility from which the parolee 
14 was paroled to issue the parolee a certificate of discharge.
15§5829.  Collection and analysis of data
161.  Outcome data and analysis.  The board shall develop and implement a process to 
17 collect and analyze data related to the basis for the outcomes of the board's determinations 
18 or decisions for granting, revoking or denying parole.  Any data related to victim 
19 identification or victim input that is identifiable to the person convicted or the person's case 
20 must be maintained but kept confidential by the board and may be released only to other 
21 government agencies, pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement, for the purposes of analysis 
22 and reporting only.
232.  Recidivism data.  When the board grants parole, the board also shall collect data 
24 related to whether the person has previously violated the law while on parole, the type of 
25 reentry program provided as part of the person's parole plan and whether the person violates 
26 the law while on parole.
273.  Record of conformance with or departure from guidelines.  The board shall 
28 determine whether a decision granting, revoking or denying parole conformed with or 
29 departed from the administrative release and revocation guidelines under sections 5824 and 
30 5825.  If the decision was a departure from the guidelines, the data collected related to 
31 victim identification or victim input are subject to the same protections as in subsection 1.
324.  Reporting.  The board shall provide the data collected pursuant to this section to 
33 the department for analysis. Using the data, the department shall assist the board in 
34 identifying specific factors that are necessary to the board's parole decision-making process 
35 and shall assist the board in securing training to facilitate the board's future decision 
36 making.
375.  Report to the Legislature.  By January 15, 2022, the board shall report to the Joint 
38 Standing Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety regarding the implementation 
39 of this subchapter.  Thereafter, annually by January 15th, the board shall update the report 
40 and make a presentation to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having 
41 jurisdiction over corrections matters regarding the operations of the board pursuant to this 
42 subchapter.  Data may be reported only in the aggregate.1

Page 6 - 130LR0195(01)16.  Cooperation.  The department, the board and other criminal justice agencies shall 
2 cooperate in implementing this subchapter.
3SUMMARY
4 This bill establishes the option of parole for persons sentenced to the custody of the 
5 Department of Corrections.  Current law provides that only persons in the custody of the 
6 Department of Corrections pursuant to a sentence imposed under the law in effect before 
7 May 1, 1976 may apply for parole.  This bill incorporates the concepts of positive reentry 
8 parole, is modeled in part on a parole law from the State of Colorado and uses some of the 
9 technical aspects of Maine's existing parole law.4
