Page 1 - 130LR0479(01)1Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2Sec. 1.  17-A MRSA ยง1051, sub-ยง2, as enacted by PL 1975, c. 499, ยง1, is amended 
3 to read:
42.   As used in this chapter, "machine gun" means a weapon of any description, by 
5 whatever name known, loaded or unloaded, which that is capable of discharging a number 
6 of projectiles in rapid succession by one manual or mechanical action on the trigger or 
7 firing mechanism, including a weapon to which a bump stock device is affixed.   For 
8 purposes of this subsection, "bump stock device" means a device that allows a firearm to 
9 discharge more than one projectile with a single mechanical action on the trigger by 
10 harnessing the recoil energy of the firearm to which the bump stock device is affixed so 
11 that the trigger resets and the firearm continues firing without additional physical 
12 manipulation of the trigger.
13SUMMARY
14 This bill amends the definition of "machine gun" to include a weapon to which a bump 
15 stock device is affixed.  Possession of a machine gun is a Class D crime.  A bump stock 
16 device is defined as a device that allows a firearm to discharge more than one projectile 
17 with a single mechanical action on the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the firearm 
18 to which the bump stock device is affixed so that the trigger resets and the firearm continues 
19 firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger.14
