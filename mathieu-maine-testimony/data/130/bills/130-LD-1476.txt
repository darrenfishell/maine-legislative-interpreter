Page 1 - 130LR1882(01)1Sec. 1.  Measures of progress and dashboard.  Resolved:  That the Maine 
2 Economic Growth Council, established under the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 10, section 
3 929-A and referred to in this resolve as "the council," in collaboration with the Department 
4 of Economic and Community Development and the State Economist, shall create measures 
5 of economic and social progress in the State and shall create a graphical user interface, 
6 referred to in this section as "the dashboard," that provides information about key 
7 performance indicators of economic and social progress.  The content of the dashboard 
8 must be informed by the Maine Economic Growth Council's "2020 Measures of Growth 
9 Report" and must measure progress against the 7 growth strategies described in the State's 
10 economic development strategy, "Maine Economic Development Strategy 2020-2029: A 
11 Focus on Talent and Innovation":  growing local talent, attracting new talent, promoting 
12 innovation, building connections, providing supporting infrastructure, maintaining stable 
13 and predictable business rules and promoting hubs of excellence.  The dashboard must be 
14 accessible on the Internet to help citizens and lawmakers to understand the State's status on 
15 key metrics, show change over time and highlight areas of strength and areas that need 
16 improvement.  The council shall explore the use of indexes, scores and data visualization 
17 to promote ease of understanding and communication of the key performance indicators.  
18 The council shall identify sources and methods of ongoing data collection and analysis for 
19 the key performance indicators, which may include primary survey research, in order to 
20 provide quarterly updates of the dashboard.  The council shall generate budgetary 
21 requirements and identify sources of funding for production and ongoing maintenance of 
22 the dashboard.  The council may consult and otherwise collaborate with a statewide 
23 development foundation to create the measures of progress and the dashboard.  The 
24 measures of progress and the dashboard must be designed to facilitate communications 
25 between constituents and stakeholders, the building of consensus around shared goals and 
26 the work of policy makers in planning investments and otherwise setting policy.  The 
27 council shall report twice yearly to the Legislature the results captured in the dashboard 
28 and on the State's progress toward achieving the goals described in the State's economic 
29 development strategy.
